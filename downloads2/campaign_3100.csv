<p>I am asking you to help me <strong>IGNITE LIVES</strong>.  Since I started this project over a year ago, I
have heard amazing stories – the story of a man who wanted to kill himself but
didn’t, the story of a woman who was taking a bucket list trip with friends
because she was very ill, the story of three women who were traveling the U.S. for
the first time on their own, and the story of a girl who ignites her life by
weaving tales of magical mermaids.  I got to meet Adrian Belic, director of the wonderful film HAPPY, who ignites his life through passion, travel,
meeting new people, playing, and curiosity.  I got to meet Kathleen Keen, a dynamic, focused woman who is married to singer/songwriter Robert Earl Keen and ignites her life through exertion, hiking, and loving herself.  And I got to meet one of my longtime heroes -- surfer/skateboarder Peggy Oki, of the famed California Zephyr skateboarding team (also known as the Z-Boys), who ignites her life by bringing attention to the plight of marine animals in her beloved second home, the ocean.  Please check out the Gallery page to see a few photos, watch some videos, and read a few stories.  I know you'll enjoy my new friends as much as I did.  NOTE:  you cannot see the Gallery page from your phone :( .  </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">It’s

<h3><br/></h3>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Hi, I'm Eric David, and the project I am doing is to write a
book on the compendium of art teachings as taught by my Teacher,  Jack Richard, which stems from his numerous
instructors, including Charles Burchfield, Robert Brackman(of The New York Art Students
League),  Aaron Bohrod ( painter of many
Time Magazine covers), Yasuo Kuniyoshi,  Ben
Shahn, Ben Stahl, and many others, 
including, (but not limited to) the  teachings of The Famous Artists' School, The
Old Masters, Illustrators, and professional artists working in the field of various
art disciplines. I would also like to include a small biography on Jack, as he
has led  a very fruitful life filled with
great experiences,(and continues to do so, at 89 years of age!), including being
commissioned to paint Four Presidents, as well as such notables as Bob Hope,
Bing Crosby, and Charles Schulz, to name a few. He has met Presidents Gerald
Ford and George Bush Sr., and painted at the time, what was the largest
portrait ever made, of Dwight D. Eisenhower, and his wife, which was commissioned
by the Tupperware Company, and painted in large sections by Tupperware
employees, who had no idea what they were painting until it was erected.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">    Jack has also had
a great many students who have achieved much in the Art world, including: <u>Charles
Pfahl</u>,  who <u>American Artist Magazine</u>
proclaimed the best Realist artist in America, (not once but twice, in
different decades), <u>Colleen Black</u>, who was commissioned by former  General  <u>Colin Powell</u>  to create bronze sculptures for himself and 7
<u>Congressional Medal of Honor</u> recipients, <u>Andrew Voth</u>,  the former director of the <u>Carnegie Art
Museum</u> in California, and John <u>Christopher Heindl</u>,  who was the Art Director for the <u>MGM Grand
Lion</u> in Las Vegas,  the largest
bronze sculpture in the hemisphere, while he was working with <u>Art
Enterprises</u>. Others include:  <u>Mark
Giangaspero</u>, who was the first person to receive top award in the <u>Butler
Institute of American Arts </u>  National Midyear Show,  two years in a row( from different nationally
known judges) and receive the Purchase Award from the Museum those same two
years. Former students also include professors of art/ painting, and
professional artists at the local and National levels.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The  body of this book
will be made up of  instruction on
materials, demos , art techniques and history, including the processes involved
for painting portraits, landscapes, still life, and abstract,  in a variety of mediums, including acrylic,
watercolor, oil, and drawing media, with an emphasis on shape and values, color
mixing, edges, design and composition,  color harmony, 
posing a subject, using reference photos and much more.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Any funds received from your donations will be used for art
supplies, (brushes, canvases, paints, camera batteries, etc.) manuscript
packages to be sent out to prospective publishers, travel expenditures that may
occur when meeting with interested potential publishers, any transcription fees
that may occur from lectures, notes, etc,..basically any expenses that may be
involved in the writing process of this book. 
I know a couple of authors who have written books, but nothing of this
scope or magnitude, so I really have no more than a ballpark idea of what the
final cost may be, so I have left the total campaign amount at $5000., Which even if not met, anything at all will be of great assistance to realize this project! And
anything extra past that will certainly expedite the writing process, and help
to make an even better production. (with any extra, I could possibly make an
accompanying DVD of demonstrations, further instruction, something along those
lines. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I also intend to split any profit or royalty stemming from
the published book with Jack, himself, as this project certainly could not be undertaken
without him.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">  Even if I cannot get a publishing company to pick this book up, I will still make an ebook copy available, and consider self publishing,(though, I understand this can run into the tens of thousands of dollars), however, I will try my hardest to make this happen with every resource available to me, including former students, my author friends,..whatever it takes.:) </p>

<h3>HeArt is for Everyone</h3>
HeArt is not only for artists: it is literally for everyone.  While we often try to devise ways of trying to give back to the community, art is what brings us together and touches our most human connection.  HeArt is connecting this beauty to heal the world by funneling impact investments from individuals like you.</div>

<p>Hi.  My name is Steve Snell and I am an artist, video maker, and pseudo-adventurer.  I am also an Artist-in-Residence at the HUB-BUB here in Spartanburg for about 3 more days.  The goal of this campaign is to raise money in order for me to remain in area for the summer and complete my newest and greatest adventure-art project,<em> THE EPIC SPARTANBURG</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>IMPACT:</strong></h2>
<p><em>THE EPIC SPARTANBURG</em> is and will be an experience built upon the collective, collaborative creativity and adventures of people from the Spartanburg community. Basically, this project invites the public to bring their ideas of adventure to me.  I will in turn accompany participants on these journeys into the unknown, while making them appear very heroic and epic in video while doing so.  The final product will be short video piece of each adventure, which will then be played on the local Spartanburg City Channel as well as part of a larger premier at the HUB-BUB Showroom.  The impact of this project will be profound on the individual level, providing people with new experiences and challenging them to take on the unknown. It will also build a visual experience of Spartanburg for the entire world to see by watching this series of video shorts via the internet.  It will make Spartanburg look EPIC, I promise.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>WHAT I NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET:</strong></h2>
<p>All donations will be used to buy equipment in order to record this adventure project in the most epic way possible.  That means things like bike and car mounts for cameras, batteries, and microphones.  Donations will also go towards subsidizing my rent in Spartanburg for the summer, so that I can remain in the area.  Basically, I’m trying to fund my own residency since my time at HUB-BUB is now over.</p>
<p>  </p>
<h2><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:</strong></h2>
<p>Spread the word about <em>THE EPIC SPARTANBURG</em> and share the video.   If you aren’t into donating or buying art, hire me for odd jobs and work!  If you know someone who might be interested in participating, tell them about this opportunity for adventure!  Here is a link to the original commercial: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUExkawibGI&amp;feature=g-upl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUExkawibGI&amp;...</a></p></div>","MY STORY:

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Kristina. I am an artist, out to prove my parents <em>WRONG</em>! Ever since I could hold a pencil, I have been doodling on every possible surface. My passions for art run deep. A few years back, I attended a Eckerd college- on my way to graduating with a degree in Fine Art. Hmmmmm, but that was <em>not</em> good enough for the parentals. All I ever heard was, ""so <em>what</em>? You just want to be a <strong>starving artist</strong>?"" UGH I HATE THOSE WORDS!</p>
<p>or I would get the old, ""Do you know how <em>few</em> people can make it as a painter? Talent does not matter.""  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>SO, I dropped out of my painting classes, and moved from Florida to Los Angeles in pursuit of more ""important"" things. Journalism, business, economics, politics, <em>WAITRESSING</em>! blah. This was not for me. I always fell back on my art to get me through. (and funny enough, my parents started singing a different tune, as that degree fell further and further away. Now it became: ""It doesn't matter what it is in, just get A DEGREE already!!! Basket weave for all we care.""  Yea, right. I was sick of wasting time, passion, and talent.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Recently I began to realize this overwhelming desire to help young woman. To encourage and inspire. To be the mentor I wished for as a teenager...just trying to fulfill my dreams, and have someone, <em>anyone</em> on my side. </p>
<p>I quickly had a light bulb go off, and have already begun to form an online community for young girls to come talk about fashion, art, hopes, fears, and service. It is a FUN place where I imagine these young ladies can grow.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.RyukoTV.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.RyukoTV.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.RyukoTV.com</a> was formed in August. In that same month, I was up for a $50k grant from Pepsi to fund a back-to-school project for underprivileged girls, but the votes did not come in fast enough. :(</p>

<p> </p>
<p>During development of that website, I realized I had a knack for graphic design; a form of art I had never even considered before! and up popped <a href=""http://www.MakeMeGraphic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.MakeMeGraphic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.MakeMeGraphic.com</a>  (Basic premise: You upload a photo, and I turn you into a one-of-a-kind piece of graphic art, by hand.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I truly think I am on the verge of something here. I found a way to BE AN ARTIST and HELP PEOPLE all at the same time. These projects can rocket me into a life, dedicated to beauty and service. Then, most importantly, I can say to mom and dad (and various skeptics---you KNOW who you are!), ""<strong>TOLD YA SO</strong>!""</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, here is where YOU come in. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am SO CLOSE to being able to do this <em>right</em>. I have the time and talent, and a wonderful web-developer......... but I do not have the money to purchase the proper equipment I need to complete the web-sites! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. First of all, for the Graphic business, I need the capacity to create HUGE files, so that when you order a piece of art, I can have them printed onto a VERY large canvas, for optimum enjoyment in your home. That is how <u>a new computer can change my life....</u> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. Printing! That's another thing. I need a means to have prints made. Expensive stuff.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. Ryuko- needs to be completed. Lots of loose ends, and I need money to copywrite my designs! Any advancement and money I make on this website will be given back ten-fold.</p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p><strong>I know I can turn your combined donations of <em>just $5,000</em> into a thriving business.</strong></p>
<p>If somehow I am <em>crazy-blessed</em> by this wonderful new way of contribution, and exceed my goal, I will have the time to work <em>less</em> on the day-to-day grind, and more on making a difference....  and on creating ART!</p>
<p>Possibilities are endless. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When you make a contribution, I will send you a personal thank you card <em>and</em> kiss your face all over if/when I ever run into you! ha! Donate a fat hunk 'o' dough, and you will get a one-of-a-kind graphic portrait of yourself, on the house! Listen, I realize what a sacrifice it is to give to someone who, might not be in dire need, (I mean I am not homeless or starving)...but give to someone who knows her dreams are worth reaching for....and has no problem asking for a little help. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, don't get me wrong. My parents <em>love</em> me and wish to see me succeed, but <em>doubt</em> is in the air people!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NOTE to mom and dad----- if you do indeed believe I can do this, feel free to donate and spread the word using the share tools. This way I can give <em>you</em> the chance to say, ""told ya so"" back at me!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>'Do It With Others'   Get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. I know not everybody can give money to a campaign, but everyone has a voice and can spread the word. THANK YOU so much for your help! I can't wait to show you what I am capable of. Let's do some good together :) Let's make something beautiful. Let's have some FUN! and most importantly, give back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Consider this paying it forward. You give me $10, and I will pay it forward. Cross my heart.</p>

<li>
<strong>Julian Norton</strong> - Husband - Father - Owner, CEO, Lead Design. I graduated with a Masters in Architecture from Kent State University. I provide the design and engineering background for the projects we undertake at Cleveland Design Studio. I love the process that goes into designing and building tangible objects from idea to hand it’s an amazing journey</li>
<li>
<strong>Yhosila</strong> - Wife - Business Management, Design. I have a Bachelor in Business Administration from Kent State University.  I was born and raised in Indonesia. I received a Fulbright Scholarship and earned the opportunity to study here in the United States. I am currently finishing my Masters of Business Administration at Cleveland State University. I bring the business background and pricing information help that is needed to ensure our studio is able to stay self-sustaining. I love creative problem solving it’s a joy to successfully overcome an issue.</li>
<li>
<strong>Trixie </strong>- Daughter - Idea Generator. I am the youngest member of CDS at 10 years old. While young my passion is equal to any fortune 500 CEO. I assist around the studio doing inventory and coming up with ""Out of the Box"" ideas that stem from my incredibly imaginative mind. </li>
</ul><p><strong> Why Start a Design Studio? (Our Story)</strong></p><ul><li>Designing has been a passion of Julian's since he was young. The ability to create what we dream is truly incredible. Design for him was an outlet to make a difference in his community and his daily life. With every item created life seemed to get little bit nicer. But quickly life seemed to get in the way and design took a backseat in his busy schedule. That all changed when he met his wife Yhosila. In Yhosila he knew he had found the missing part of his life. Yhosila is the kind of person who does what she says and would move a mountain if it was in her way (when they met he was in the way of the food table - she quickly sorted him out). She does not accept anything but the best in people because that is what she gives to everyone. Our family grew when we adopted her sister Trixie. Trixie is a girl who has more courage than a lion and a bigger heart than an elephant. She helps ground us morally as she is the type of person who would gladly share her food even if it meant she would go without.  As we became a family we incurred expense after expense between legal and immigration issues, education expenses and student loans we were unable to make ends meet through a traditional 8-5. While brainstorming we thought of everything we could do to try to cut expenses and generate income. Sitting at our kitchen table we realized the answers were all around us; hanging on every wall and in every corner of our home. The old relics of the designs we had experimented with would become the vehicle for the support we desperately needed, thus Cleveland Design Studio was created. Our family and our studio is determined to make a difference. Not only improving our lives but to help our community as they have helped us. We know that without our family, friends, and the kindness of strangers our studio will just be a dream. We are offering samples of our work to anyone who is able to help support our cause with a donation as a thank you for believing in us.</li></ul><p><strong>End Goal</strong></p><ul><li>With the starting capital we hope to raise here we know we can produce not only creative designs and art but also give back to the community and the people who need it most. Since 2016 we have set up scholarships at the local city level to help student with educational expenses. One of the major goals of this Studio is to help supplement our family's expenses and to increase the amount of scholarships we can offer. We hope to be able to set aside a percentage of every sale we make in the first 10 years of operation to finance the creation of a marker space for local children and young adults. Here they will learn how design and their creative abilities can lead to a better everyday life. By creating rather than destroying local youth and dreamers can positively change the world they live in. Every person will be able to market their designs through our web portal and help raise funds for themselves and their goals and to expand and improve the studio.</li></ul><p><strong>Breakdown of What Your Funds are Going To</strong></p><ul><li>Our essential fund raising goal is $8,500 dollars. With that money we will be able to expand and purchase a laser cutter. This will allow the creation of designs and products that can be sold on an industrial scale. The breakdown of our funds will go as follows:<ul>
<li>$8,200 is the actual cost of the 80W laser and the cooling system that it will need. </li>
<li>$300 is the cost for shipping the machine to our studio in Cleveland.</li>
</ul>
</li></ul><p>If we are able to raise any additional funds we plan to do the following;</p><ul>
<li>An additional $400 will allow us to purchase a rotary tool that will help us create objects that are cylindrical like personalized bats and glassware.</li>
<li>An additional $4000 will allow the rotary tool plus use an upgraded 150W laser head. This upgraded laser will allow us to cut Hardwoods such as Cherry, Teak, and Hickory.</li>
<li>Any additional money after $12,000 total will be used to upgrade the materials we can offer and help purchase additional tools for our studio such as: clamps, a band-saw, a shop vacuum system, an additional power upgrade to the studio, and for the creation of our own website.</li>
<li>Any additional money after $15,000 total raised will allow us to break into additional markets and Medias with the purchase of a screen printing machine for T shirt design and 3d printer for quick prototyping.  We hope to purchase a robotic CNC machine for carving 1/2"" and 1"" plywood quickly and a ceramic studio for making pottery. </li>

<p>We are a group of friends, artists, and people experienced with Burning Man culture. Through a large scale art project, known as The Journey, we are looking to build upon our joint playa histories of collaboration to create a reflective, interactive experience for Burning Man 2017. This campaign provides the money we need to get this project up and running. Through your contribution we will be able to buy materials, rent work space and get us to Burning Man.</p>

<p>This art piece is a large project with a budget just under $67k. We have applied for a BM Honoraria but we don’t anticipate our entire project to be funded by BM. Whether you go to Burning Man or not, we will gift each and every donation with a little bit of playa experience by means of our perks. Regardless of how much money is raised all funds will go directly to production of The Journey. The better we do at raising funds for the project, the more immersive experience we will provide at Burning Man. If we are not able to raise the entire budget, we will scale back the project and maybe provide fewer lights or interactive opportunities, that would really suck. So make it a reality.</p>

<p>What started as a scale model in April 2016, quickly led to a full scale proof of concept by this past fall. In October we took The Journey Run, a proof of concept piece, to YOUtopia, a Burning Man regional event in San Diego and Palm Springs PRIDE. Both events were wildly successful engaging communities and providing unique and memorable experiences for festival goers. People so loved The Journey Run experience, we started seeing profile pictures popping up all over Facebook taken at the nighttime sculpture.</p>

<p>Our two largest challenges, other than funding of course, are finding the programmatic technical expertise and space for storage and production. In both of these areas we have been reaching out to the larger Burning Man community in Southern California and have been met with responsive support.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Malik Nashad Sharpe, a choreographer and video artist based between New York City, and London, UK. I am currently finishing the development of my newest work ""SAD KING,"" which is a meditation around Black, Queer joyousness and choreographic form. A collaboration between myself as marikiscrycrycry (solo performance alias), The Hague-based musician, yEs!yEs, and under the mentorship New York City choreographer Tere O'Connor, ""SAD KING"" has been developed over the last year as a way to give another material voice to a fraught, yet visionary experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the success of my last work ""A S S I M I L A T I O N,"" including its international tour, which is still ongoing, there has been immense interest in showing ""SAD KING"" and it has secured premieres at the Brooklyn Arts Exchange, and FiveMyles Gallery in November, at the Hackney Showroom, London, UK in January 2017,  at the Black Box Teater in Oslo, Norway in February 2017, and at AKC Medika in March/April 2017. </p>
<p>Your generous donation would ensure that I can feasibly tour this work by contributing to travel costs, honorarium for my collaborators, and general miscellaneous expenses that include makeup, glitter, and other materials. Most importantly, your support will help me bring my work to a variety of audiences across the globe, to revel in my research around Black, Queer identity!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I am asking for $1700USD (Although you don't have to donate in USD if you are located in Europe, Canada, or elsewhere!) to help fray the cost of flights (London--&gt;NYC, NYC--&gt;London, London--&gt;Oslo, Oslo--&gt;Zagreb, Zagreb--&gt;London), and accommodation as I plan the touring of this work,  to pay my collaborators what they deserve for contributing massively to the creation of ""SAD KIND"", and for miscellaneous materials that I will need for the continuance of this work. This is only a fraction of the total cost of touring this work, and your contribution would have immense impacts! Anything will help.</p>
<p>And there are perks! There are a series of gifts (photos, interviews, writings, posters, tickets, videos, amongst other things that I can offer as a thank you for your generosity)</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Without your support for my work, it wouldn't be possible to share my research with a wider audience. After I performed my last work ""A S S I M I L A T I O N"" in Zagreb, a little Croatian girl, maybe 2-3 years old, came to me with her Father after the performance to say that she thought I was beautiful and special, and it gave me hope that my work can reach far and wide, despite its political focus and radicality, even to young children who do not have active discourse on Black or Queer issues/experiences!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As I continue to make work, my urge to share grows even larger and I want to reach people, especially during this tough time where we are living through immensely fraught times, from impending climate disaster, to the ruthless spectacle of Black death, from the advent of Brexit, to the rise of Donald Trump. I want to speak to people's subconscious about how these times act  honestly upon the Black, Queer experience without dogmatism. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The funding for my work at this particular time is extremely difficult as there is little to no funding for the kind of work that I am making, and due to my recent relocation to London, where I do not have legal rights or recourse to public funding for the arts. While I am being supported in a myriad of ways that work well with my situation, funding is needed to show, sustain, market, and land my work. I work incessantly, and I spend hundreds of hours making material, researching, and experimenting so that I can share something with an audience. Your generous support will go far in helping me reach my goals and land my work in all of the interested places, venues, countries, and cultures. </p>

<p>Hi! I'm Fizz. If you know me on the internet, you probably know me as Relsqui. Maybe you're here because you appreciate my community moderation, my public writing, or my friendship, and you'd like to support my personal project. Maybe you're here because you think I'm a terrible person and you want to stab me in the face. Either way, this campaign has you covered.</p>
<h3>Why Do You Want to Get Stabbed in the Face?</h3>
<p>So far I've been stabbed in the face (including ears) seven times:</p>
<ul>
<li>three times in my earlobes (two left, one right)</li>
<li>once in the eyebrow</li>
<li>twice in the cartilege of my right ear</li>
<li>once through my nostril</li>
</ul><p>In each case, the stabbing was done with a sterile needle and appropriate safety precautions by either a licensed professional or a student with professional oversight, and surgical-steel jewelry was inserted.</p>
<p>I get pierced for a few reasons. Altering my body makes it more <em>my</em> body, giving me creative control over the physical structure that houses my mind and represents me to the world. It sends a very general signal to other people about who I am and what I value, inviting similar people to talk to me and sparing me the attention of those who don't approve of my choices. They feel nice (and sound nice, in the case of the two rings clicking together in one earlobe). And, of course, I love the way they look. Especially a lot of them all together.</p>
<h3>So What's Stopping You? Why the Campaign?</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, I'm poor. I can house and (usually) feed myself, but I can't really do anything else. Even if I were able to put that much money away, I can't justify spending it on aesthetic body modifications rather than something practical (food, transit, medical needs, or saving for future calamities).</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean it's not important. Especially now, when lack of money and lack of time leave me feeling like I have little control over my life, getting to do something just because it feels good is a rare luxury. The funding campaign creates a pool of money which I can <em>only</em> use for this purpose--no excuses, no guilt, no justification. It will remind me of the control I do have, make me stand a little straighter, and put a smile on my face whenever I look in the mirror.<em><br/></em></p>
<div>
<h3>How Does the Funding Goal Break Down?</h3>
<p>This is a flexible funding campaign, which means that all donations will go into the fund whether or not the funding goal is met. That's because the minimum funding that would allow me to meet my goals is around <strong>$100</strong>, my intended target (after doing some arithmetic) is <strong>$300</strong>, and the smallest goal IndieGoGo supports is <strong>$500</strong>. I would be delighted to reach any of those numbers. Here's what happens if we do*:</p>
<ul>
<li>With <strong>$100</strong>, I can get <strong>one facial or ear piercing</strong>, tip my piercer, send perks to the donors, and pay IndieGoGo's and Paypal's fees.</li>
<li>With <strong>$175</strong>, I can get <strong>two facial/ear piercings</strong>, tip my piercer, etc.</li>
<li>With <strong>$240</strong>, I can get <strong>three facial/ear piercings</strong>, etc. and</li>
<li>With <strong>$300</strong> I can get <strong>four.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*<em>(These numbers have changed slightly since the campaign was originally posted; I'm adjusting for Paypal fees and leaving myself some wiggle room for aftercare supplies and other unforeseen but related expenses.)</em></p>
<p>After $300 is where it really starts to get interesting.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we meet the funding goal of <strong>$500</strong>, along with the above, I can branch out from face-stabbing and get <strong>stabbed in the chest.</strong> On both sides.</li>
<li>At <strong>$750</strong>, I can go even further and get <strong>stabbed in the junk.</strong> Yep, below the belt. Don't worry about me chickening out of this one; I've done it before and have been planning the next one ever since.</li>
<li>If you generous folks <strong>double the funding goal</strong> and reach <strong>$1000</strong>, something really amazing happens: not only am I going to get stabbed a whole lot of times, I'll have at least part of the work done <strong>at Fakir's teaching workshop in San Francisco</strong> by well-trained student piercers. I will also have <strong>high-quality photographs</strong> of the finished work taken.</li>
</ul>
<p>... and wouldn't that be phenomenal? I get stabbed like a pincushion, some students get to practice on an experienced volunteer, and you all get some really nice pictures of the result.</p>
<h3>Which Parts of Your Face Will Get Stabbed? Who Will Actually Do the Stabbing?</h3>
<p>There are a number of specific piercings I want to get, in addition to the ones I have now:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <strong>industrial piercing</strong>
</li>
<li>a third <strong>helix piercing</strong>
</li>
<li>at least one <strong>eyebrow piercing</strong>, replacing one I already had and removed because it wasn't healing properly</li>
<li>at least one <strong>lip piercing</strong>
</li>
<li>a <strong>nipple piercing</strong> on each side</li>
<li>at least two more <strong>genital piercings</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact layout is not set in stone. Every time I get a new piercing, my appearance changes slightly, and I adjust my ideas to fit. (If you want to contribute <em>your</em> ideas, check out the Erudite Stabber donor tier.) Suffice it to say that ever since I got the first one I've had at least one or two in mind that I was ready to get next.</p>
<p>There are a number of high-quality piercing shops where I live, two of which I've visited and one of which I've had work done at before. I'll definitely revisit that last, but may take the opportunity to try another as well--and if we meet our stretchiest stretch goal, at least some of the stabbing will happen at Fakir's teaching workshop in San Francisco. In any case, I'll absolutely be posting links and recommendations after the campaign ends, but while I'm still raising funds I don't want this page to be associated with a specific business which hasn't chosen to participate in it.</p>

<h3>What's In It For Me?</h3>
<p>Everyone who donates to this campaign will receive one very special perk, which has perhaps never been offered by a crowdfunding campaign before: the ability to truthfully say for the rest of your life,</p>

<p>If that alone isn't enough to entice you ... you and I are dissimilar. But, well, if that alone isn't enough to entice you, here are a selection of other perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, everyone who donates at least <strong>$5</strong> will get <strong>pictures of all the finished piercings</strong>. This is kind of a no-brainer! They're body art, and meant to be shown off. Note that, stretch goals notwithstanding, by default I will only be sharing pictures of above-the-neck piercings.</li>
<li>Everyone who donates at least <strong>$20</strong> will get a <strong>handwritten thank-you note</strong> from me. When was the last time you got a handwritten letter in the mail, much less a fancy thank-you card? Wouldn't that be a nice change of pace from bills and junk mail?</li>
<li>When I go to get stabbed, if the piercer permits, I will take <strong>photos or video of the work in progress</strong>, and send them to everyone who donates at least <strong>$40</strong>.</li>
<li>Donors at the <strong>$70</strong> tier and above get to <strong>participate in the decisions</strong> of what piercings to get before I get them, and also watch the work get done on a <strong>live hangout.</strong>
</li>
<li>For everyone who donates at least <strong>$100</strong>, I will write a <strong>custom, original Shakespearean sonnet</strong> about you and how great you are. If you're on the fence about this one, keep an eye on the campaign--I'll post an example partway through to help you make up your mind.</li>
<li>At <strong>$150</strong> things start to get silly. To best ensure my new piercings are visible to be admired, for every donor at this level I will <strong>keep my head shaved</strong> for at least <strong>one month</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last, but not least:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the deeply passionate stabbing aficionado who donates at the <strong>$250</strong> level, I will go further in two ways than for any donor at a previous tier: I will <strong>keep my head shaved</strong> for at least <strong>one year</strong>, ensuring that everyone I meet can appreciate the results of your generosity. I will also make a video in which I do a <strong>dramatic reading of your personal sonnet</strong> and post it on the internet. You will be the most famous stab-funder in history.<strong><br/></strong>

I have the amazing opportunity to study printmaking in India with Lotta Jansdotter. Traveling to India is something I have always dreamed of doing, so when I heard about this trip I knew it was the right time! This adventure will allow me to be fully immersed in the practice of making art - creating a new body of photographic work inspired by the colors of India and also learning a new skill that will help me grow as an artist and art educator. With your contributions I will get to explore a new country, build my portfolio, and bring back what I have learned to share with my community.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is a link with the trip details:</p>

<p>I will spend 8 days in Jaipur – The Pink City – located in Northern India. Jaipur is a bustling city known for its beautiful artwork and textiles. During the 8 days, I will tour museums and artists’ studios, participate in a printmaking workshop led by artist, Lotta Jansdotter, shop the colorful bazaars, eat amazing food, and soak in all of the sites this creative city has to offer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The total cost of the trip and art show afterward will be close to $5,000.</p>
<p>$3,149 – Ace Camp – includes accommodations (8 nights), food, transportation in India, museum admissions, and the 3 day workshop with Lotta.</p>
<p>$1,000 – Round trip airfare to New Delhi – with a 17 hour layover in London, England!</p>
<p>$40 – Round trip train fare from New Delhi to Jaipur.</p>

Hi, I’m Lauren – an artist, art teacher, and photographer. I have the amazing opportunity to study printmaking in India with Lotta Jansdotter. Traveling to India is something I have always dreamed of doing, so when I heard about this trip I knew it was the right time! This adventure will allow me to be fully immersed in the practice of making art - creating a new body of photographic work inspired by the colors of India and also learning a new skill that will help me grow as an artist and art educator. With your contributions I will get to explore a new country, build my portfolio, and bring back what I have learned to share with my community.  
 
Here is a link with the trip details:
http://ritchieacecamps.com/lotta-jansdotter/
 
How much will it cost?


I will spend 8 days in Jaipur – The Pink City – located in Northern India. Jaipur is a bustling city known for its beautiful artwork and textiles. During the 8 days, I will tour museums and artists’ studios, participate in a printmaking workshop led by artist, Lotta Jansdotter, shop the colorful bazaars, eat amazing food, and soak in all of the sites this creative city has to offer.
 
The total cost of the trip and art show afterward will be close to $5,000.
$3,149 – Ace Camp – includes accommodations (8 nights), food, transportation in India, museum admissions, and the 3 day workshop with Lotta.
$1,000 – Round trip airfare to New Delhi – with a 17 hour layover in London, England!
$40 – Round trip train fare from New Delhi to Jaipur.
$100 or more – Miscellaneous (bus/taxi) travel expenses in New Delhi, Jaipur, and London.
$100 or more – Food outside of the workshop
The rest of the funds will go toward buying supplies to print on during the workshop, fulfilling the perks listed here, and having a solo exhibition at Two-Thirds Studio in early 2014.

Despite the pervasiveness of rape and sexual assault in our society, affecting one in six women and one in thirty two men, survivors are shamed from speaking out about their experiences. Once I began speaking out, others came to me with their stories. The more I listened, the more I felt very strongly that these stories needed a place where they could be honored and serve as a platform for discussion about sexual assault and rape in our communities.<br/><p></p><p>I started by breaking the stories down into three parts and storing them in three colored jars to mark the three stages of each experience: the green jar held the beginning of each person's experience. The red jar stored words and phrases concerning the assault. The blue contained each survivor's personal reflections on the experience at the time they submitted their story. The stories began to build, the jars taking on their own symbolic meaning as containers of a complex and socially repressed discourse. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/259160/files/20131213095017-033.jpg?1386957017"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Artists' Books for Social Change<br/>
</h2><p>In 2013, I decided to create a limited edition, hand-made digitally &amp; letterpress printed set of books based on JARRING with the goal of creating a publicly accessible archive that 
would truly honor these stories, 
building a bridge between private and public discourse. The project entails making three books, one for each jar or part of the story, in a set of 50. Each book utilizes a different book structure to create a unique experience that honors the text and experiences represented while using the artwork and structure of the book to tell a story embedded in form, imagery, and movement as well as language. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/314092/files/20140117090049-grid.jpg?1389978049"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>Book one</b> is a letterpress printed, accordion format book printed in an edition of 50 printed during a residency at <a href=""http://www.wsworkshop.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Women's Studio Workshop</a> in Rosendale, NY.

</h3><p><b>Why Share Stories of Sexual Assault?</b><br/>I believe strongly that every narrative deserves a place for discussion in our community. This is especially important in regards to narratives which we find difficult to tell, and those which are difficult to hear. These narratives are integral to our understanding and acknowledgement of one of the most complex and destructive issues we face in society. By launching this project, it is my goal to encourage dialogue, unite the voices of survivors, dispel many of the myths related to sexual assault and rape by confronting them with true experiences, raise funds for RCCs through book sales and donations, and create an archive that is accessible to the public for research as well as for personal therapeutic use. <br/><br/><b>What Are the Funds Needed For?</b><br/>In addition to the material costs, which for a set of three hand-made books (including one letterpress book) in an edition of 50 are pretty overwhelming, I've also been paying for any associated costs (including residency costs, travel costs, and letterpress access) out of pocket. I have not factored in any costs associated with my own labor as I am not paying myself for my time. Your donations specifically will go towards material costs, travel costs, residency costs, and shipping costs necessary for the completion and placement of the books. </p><p><b>What Is An RCC? Why Support RCCs?</b><br/>Rape Crisis Centers (RCCs) provide vital services to survivors of sexual assault and rape that are absolutely crucial. These services may include offering counseling services, operating hotlines, community outreach &amp; education, accompanying victims to the police station or hospital, helping survivors to make and pursue police reports, arranging legal or medical services, arranging victim's compensation for psychiatric services, and much more. Many RCCs are staffed primarily by volunteers and all are greatly assisted by public donations. Your contribution ensures they can continue to provide these necessary services. <br/></p><p><b>Why Don't I Just Donate to the RCC Directly?</b><br/>Considering the difference in costs and book sales, this project has the potential to raise over $20,000 for RCCs. Any donations I receive in excess of what I need to complete this project will also go towards donations to RCCs AND you'll get an artwork perk for your donation. So this way, you get something great for your donation and get to be part of a larger campaign with a potentially bigger payoff.<br/></p><p><b>Why Is the Book So Expensive?</b><br/>Unlike commercially produced 
books, self-published artist's books are extremely time 
consuming and costly to make. While I could have produced a more
 inexpensive, commercially accessible version of Jarring, I decided to 
create this set of limited edition artist's books using high quality materials with the intention of 
both honoring the narratives and creating work which is archival and built to last. I've tried to make the reward of the books as inexpensive
 as possible, but in order to support my goal of donating 1 handling copy to an 
RCC for every copy sold, I can't make it any less without the fundraising goal of the project losing strength. Update: I have added a perk of an economically priced, digitally printed codex set for private collections should you wish to have a version of the books for yourself or your organization. <br/></p><h3>How Else Can I Help?</h3><p>If you are an artist and would like to run a similar campaign for a local crisis center, you can become a part of Art Against Assault.

Artists' Books for Social Change
Jarring is a project by artist Mirabelle Jones to create a set of letterpress & digitally printed artists' books that end the silence and stigma surrounding sexual assault and rape by sharing the real life experiences of 22 survivors. The goal of this project is to create a publicly accessible archive of survivor narratives while raising funds for Rape Crisis Centers (RCCs) through book sales. Any funds received which are in excess of this project's goal amount will be turned into donations for Rape Crisis Centers as well as any profits from book sales.Ending the Stigma & Silence Surrounding Sexual Assault

<p></p></div>","the Love Letters Project
Since February of 2013 I have been typing love letters, making 100 copies and anonymously inserting them in the SF weekly on Wednesday. Some of the letters have been previously written at some point in history. Taken from poetry, lyrics, famous people, made up by me. 
The letters are intense, some are funny, desperate, all mixed with emotions, full of typos, imperfect.






The motivation to do this was in a sense to bring love back. Love Letters is inspired by conceptual and installation art. I wanted to set up an intimate experience for a stranger. Inserting the letters in the SF weekly was an easy and effective way of getting them out in the city. It allowed anyone that picked up the paper the chance to discover a letter. I do not give any indication of who wrote the letter or what the letter is intended for. My objective is for the person to have their own individual experience without interference or self-promotion. 
the Love Letters Book & Exhibit
In February 2014 (1 year anniversary of the project) all of the letters will framed and exhibited in Adobe Bookstore located in the Mission District of San Francisco, California. On February 14th, 2014 (Valentine's Day) I will have an event at Adobe. This will be an exhibition and a book release party for Love letters. I am raising money so that I afford to print the book in time for the event.





What am I raising money for...


I will be printing 250 books for the exhibition Love Letters at 1984 Printing in Oakland. The cost of printing is $1060.
$900 for a 64 page book
$160 for a full color cover
All the money I raise will go to the cost of printing the book.

Why contribute? What's the impact?
By supporting this project you are supporting the creation of a book from this year long project, Love letters. 
It is a conscious decision to bring my project to 1984 printing. They are a small printing company run by two women in Oakland. By contributing to this campaign, not only are you supporting my project you are also supporting small business owners. 
The exhibit will take place at Adobe books. Adobe has a long history in San Francisco and have supported the work of local artists for 25 years. Last year the land lord raised their rent and they were evicted. Luckily they were able to do an indiegogo campaign of their own to relocate. www.indiegogo.com/projects/save-adobe-books/x/478038. By supporting this project you are also supporting the success of events at Adobe Books.

It has always been a dream of mine to produce artwork for a living, I think that can be said of most artists. Along with that dream though, I've got many more artistic dreams such as learning animation, starting a comic series, becoming a sign maker, the list goes on. The sorts of projects I'm truly passionate about and would love to explore are nowadays, mostly digital. Most digital artistic endeavors boil down to a few simple tools, but none more vital than a computer. Specifically one that can stand up to whatever challenges the artist has to throw at it. I'm hoping to upgrade my creative arsenal in a big way, as I'm currently confined to only traditional mediums. Although traditional mediums are fantastic, they don't lend themselves to being easily shared with the entire world via the internet. I have many projects lined up to work on this winter (after all, there's not much else to do off-season on Cape Cod) and in order to pursue these projects, I'm going to need a computer with some serious power....because my three year old laptop that I use for pretty much everything has started to kick the bucket and can barely handle email at this point, let alone any programs needed to produce digital artwork.<br/><br/>That's where you come in. With your help I'm hoping to raise enough money to buy a computer with some serious processing power so that I can learn some new things, create some great work and at some point make a living off of it. This is just the catalyst for hoping to complete a lifelong dream and YOU could contribute to it! I've got some great perks for those who donate and every little bit helps, really, any donations are appreciated. <br/><br/>I priced out what I would need for a custom computer fit with all the hardware I need to accomplish the projects I have in mind, and the price of that computer is the goal I'm hoping to reach. With it being a custom computer, if I don't reach the goal, I can always swap out components, so all money donated is still going toward furthering my artistic accomplishments. Once I've got the computer, I plan on opening commissions, starting a Patreon account and releasing all sorts of material like webcomics, illustrated podcasts and eventually, somewhere down the line, an animated webseries. With these goals in mind, I'll hopefully also accomplish my dream of making a living off of my artwork!<br/><br/>I hope you'll help me open up a new chapter in my life and please donate or share this with friends or other patrons of the arts in order to reach this goal!

<p><b>Why working is with girls in Goma, DRC so important ? </b></p>
<p>Colors of Connection is dedicated to bringing the arts to
war-affected populations and DR Congo is one such place that has had a long
history of conflict. In staggering fact, the most recent conflict, focused in
the eastern region of the country, has resulted in over six million deaths, the
largest loss of lives since World War II. Intertwined with the conflict is
sexual and gender based violence (SGBV) that is wielded as a weapon of war. It
is estimated that 40% of women and girls in the eastern region of Congo have
been subjected to sexual violence since 1996.  </p>
<p>Out-of-school adolescent girls in DR Congo are a group that is
particularly marginalized and vulnerable to sexual violence as they are
socially isolated and lack access to education and support systems that can
educate and protect them. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><b>36 out-of-school teenage girls</b> will participate in a 14 week psychosocial arts based program, in which they will have the opportunity to express themselves emotionally through art, learn to protect themselves from sexual violence, understand their rights, and engage as leaders in their community.  The project will culminate in their creation of 2 murals in public spaces in Goma City, in collaboration with community leaders, addressing girls' rights and girls' protection.</p>
<p>During their creation of the murals, the girl participants will be brought into the spotlight of the community, empowered to have a voice in regards to their needs, rights, hopes, and dreams and be able display their talents as leaders and artists.  This process and the product of these collaborative murals in public space will lead to a shift in perceptions of girls and their role in society by the community and the girls themselves. </p>
<p><b>This project recognizes that adolescent girls have untapped potential, talent, and importantly a vital voice to add to their community and that the arts are a powerful medium, hugely beneficial in situations of distress and trauma.  </b></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Working in a post-conflict zone such as Goma, DR Congo poses
both logistical challenges and security risks. 
For this reason we are proud to be working in partnership with the
International Rescue Committee (IRC), an international organization who have
been working in this region since 1996. 
Our partnership with the IRC will ensure that we operate in a way that
ensures safety for our staff and the help of a larger experienced organization
in problem solving logistic issues as they arise.  </p>
<p>A risk of foreigners entering a new community is that expatriate
staff can fail to understand the cultural context, at best being ineffective in
their work or at worst, doing more harm than good.  We strive for our
staff to apply cultural sensitivity to their work with the community members
and individuals during the projects. To
help us tackle this challenge we are happy to have one of the lead members
of the team, Nadia Fazal work with us on this project.  Nadia has been working in Eastern Congo since
2006 and has come to know and understand the community in Goma.  In addition we will recruit local staff and
seek guidance and direction for the project from community leaders.  In general, in our work Colors of
Connection follows the recommendations of a culture-centered
approach, recognizing that we need to be able to identify the strengths and
weaknesses of the specific cultural contexts we work in and to design projects
in accordance with this knowledge. </p>
<p>Every project presents its unknown risks and challenges, but
so far we’ve successfully  completed
every project we’ve set out to do, totaling six public art projects since 2011.  In the refugee camps and post-war towns where we’ve worked, our projects have been met with enthusiastic positive responses
from communities, youth, partners and donors.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our wish list:</p>

This money will allow us to work with a designer, have a technician who can do our lighting and sound, get producing support so we can invite important people in to give us feedback and see the show. It will also help us hire the right projectors, pay for design and any other specialist hires (for example our performer needs a microphone), and rehearsal space. </li>
<li>Our perks range from a thank you in our programme and online, to a downloadable recording of the show, to a postcard story from our writer, or if you're feeling really generous then our writer/performer will write you a story especially for you or a person of your choosing (gift idea alert!). </li>

Many of you know me as Artologica on <a href=""https://twitter.com/artologica"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">twitter</a> and <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/shop/artologica"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">etsy</a>.  I’ve been painting cells, bacteria, viruses and more for many years, but I’ve
never had the opportunity to work with real scientists in a lab – until now!
I’ve been selected to be the Artist-in-Residence at the Kilpisjärvi Biological
Station in Finland in October and November 2015. I’m very excited about this
opportunity to enrich my science-art work, and I need your help to make it
happen.</span><br/>
</h3>
<div>
<p>
</p>
<h3><b>Ars Bioarctica and Kilpisjärvi Biological Station</b></h3>
<p>The
<a href=""http://bioartsociety.fi/ars-bioarctica-residency"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ars Bioarctica Residency Program</a> is a joint project of the Finnish Bioart
Society and the <a href=""http://www.helsinki.fi/kilpis/english/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kilpisjärvi Biological Station</a> in sub-Arctic Lapland. The
residency focuses on the Arctic environment and art and science
collaboration.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431093089/zra6aqyo57ekmdb2jqni.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The
Kilpisjärvi Biological Station offers the artists-in-residence the opportunity
to work closely with its scientists and staff. This includes access to
scientific equipment, laboratory facilities, the library and seminar room as
well as the use of field equipment. The station, which is a part of the
University of Helsinki, supports the work of many long-range research projects
on vegetation, local fauna and soil chemistry, among others. Its location near
the Arctic Circle puts it on the front lines of climate change, a subject of
much of my recent art.</p>
<h3><b>What will I do there?</b></h3>
<p>This
is not a studio residency, so I don’t expect to be coming home with bundles of
finished paintings. It’s mainly an opportunity for me to watch, learn and
listen. I plan to explore the Arctic landscape, observe the scientists, gather
some samples, peer through microscopes, ask a lot of questions, take a lot of
pictures, and do some sketching and painting.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431093218/rtbt0f2q60nhew6yex0q.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>(This is <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Kilpisjärvi. Pretty nice, huh?)</span></p>
<p>Then,
after I come home, I’ll process all this new information and use it to create
new, deeper, stronger artwork. I also plan to write and talk about the
experience of artist-scientist collaboration, and I hope to have an exhibition
of the work inspired by my residency. </p>
<p>That said, there's no end product to this project. This residency is an experience, a unique opportunity for me to learn and grow as an artist, and your support will help me to take full advantage of it.</p>
<h3><b>What will your contribution cover?</b></h3>
<p>Like
most art residencies, this one is unfunded. I hope to raise enough money
through Indiegogo to cover the following expenses:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Flights and ground

</ul>
<h3><b>What do you get as a thank you? </b></h3>

</div></div>","My name is Michele Banks and I’m an artist inspired by science. Many of you know me as Artologica on twitter and etsy.  I’ve been painting cells, bacteria, viruses and more for many years, but I’ve
never had the opportunity to work with real scientists in a lab – until now!
I’ve been selected to be the Artist-in-Residence at the Kilpisjärvi Biological
Station in Finland in October and November 2015. I’m very excited about this
opportunity to enrich my science-art work, and I need your help to make it
happen.




Ars Bioarctica and Kilpisjärvi Biological Station
The
Ars Bioarctica Residency Program is a joint project of the Finnish Bioart
Society and the Kilpisjärvi Biological Station in sub-Arctic Lapland. The
residency focuses on the Arctic environment and art and science
collaboration.


The
Kilpisjärvi Biological Station offers the artists-in-residence the opportunity
to work closely with its scientists and staff. This includes access to
scientific equipment, laboratory facilities, the library and seminar room as
well as the use of field equipment. The station, which is a part of the
University of Helsinki, supports the work of many long-range research projects
on vegetation, local fauna and soil chemistry, among others. Its location near
the Arctic Circle puts it on the front lines of climate change, a subject of
much of my recent art.
What will I do there?
This
is not a studio residency, so I don’t expect to be coming home with bundles of
finished paintings. It’s mainly an opportunity for me to watch, learn and
listen. I plan to explore the Arctic landscape, observe the scientists, gather
some samples, peer through microscopes, ask a lot of questions, take a lot of
pictures, and do some sketching and painting.


(This is Kilpisjärvi. Pretty nice, huh?)
Then,
after I come home, I’ll process all this new information and use it to create
new, deeper, stronger artwork. I also plan to write and talk about the
experience of artist-scientist collaboration, and I hope to have an exhibition
of the work inspired by my residency. 
That said, there's no end product to this project. This residency is an experience, a unique opportunity for me to learn and grow as an artist, and your support will help me to take full advantage of it.
What will your contribution cover?
Like
most art residencies, this one is unfunded. I hope to raise enough money
through Indiegogo to cover the following expenses:



Flights and ground
transportation to and from Kilpisjärvi


Room and board
expenses at the Biological Station


Art materials,
equipment and supplies


What do you get as a thank you? 
I'm
so excited about the opportunity to go to Finland and work with scientists that
I've come up with some great perks to thank the people who are supporting me.

<p>""The bodies of Black women as mothers and birth attendants have been heralded as deviant, unclean, promiscuous, and innately pathological within the Western medical establishment.  Consequently, in an effort to stave off diseases that supposedly Black bodies carried, the interdependent relationship between the medical and legal professions justified a persistent subjugation and persecution of the Black female midwives in the U.S. and in the Caribbean in the late 1800s through the mid-1900s. This project and artwork seek to discuss the ways in which Black midwives and birthing mothers resisted by passing along intergenerational knowledge of healing and birthing traditions within the African diaspora.  This work seeks to make visible their contributions to the survival of Black birthing subcultures and beliefs while also outlining how Foucault’s concept of biopolitics is a useful lens to view how nation states engage in corralling the Black female form.

I’m Manuela Reyes, a graduate student from the Masters of Arts in Curatorial Practice at the School of Visual Arts...thank you for coming :) This is a crowdfunding campaign for my thesis exhibition and curatorial long term project. If you haven’t watched the video, please do! The Ocean We Inhabit will be the inaugural exhibition of PlanetArt Fund, a non-profit organization that I am currently creating to advocate environmental awareness and change. The exhibition will consist of a multisensory experience at the National Aquarium in Baltimore featuring a video art projection by the pioneer of performance and video art, Joan Jonas, the U.S Representative of the 56th Venice Biennale, 2015.  Socially engaged Mexican artist Pablo Helguera will create a narrative performance and Portuguese composer Bernardo Rosa will create a sound piece.  Colombian-Italian dance therapist and architect Martha Raquel Herrera will lead a dance workshop for the children of Baltimore.PlanetArt Fund is currently in talks with other surprise artists who will also be participating in the exhibition...I know, it all seems  impossible. Almost everybody thought the same just a few months ago when I first introduced my idea, and here we are. The exhibition will be documented and with your generous support will tour internationally to other aquariums and museum venues sharing Baltimore’s inaugural experience.  PlanetArt Fund is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of PlanetArt Fund must be made payable to Fractured Atlas only and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.WHY YOU SHOULD HELPOur
world is going through a transformational process. Being aware of the harm we
have created to the planet, we understand that there has come a time to act. We must start changing the way we interact and relate
to the planet’s environment.  In developing situations were people can sense new ways to understand
nature, we can enhance this dialogue through carefully thought
interdisciplinary projects, creating situations where humans, art, and nature
coexist.
PlanetArt
Fund will be a non-profit organization that creates multidisciplinary, collective
exhibitions that create  environmental awareness. Creating transformations through experiential exhibitions,
PlanetArt Fund embraces projects that create a reflection on contemporary
consciousness through art. The foundation will express an aim to support artistic
productions that deal with nature, combining the visual arts, design,
performative arts, film, and sound arts.  PlanetArt Fund will create
awareness to the international community uniting art, society and nature.
Through PlanetArt Fund's projects, people will become aware and
mindful of the impact they have with the environment, contributing to
create positive transformations in our society. Join us on April 28th, 2016 at The National Aquarium in Baltimore!We have the venue, we have amazing artists, we have a solid marketing and social media team, now we need the money to close the deal. Help us reach this final and  crucial goal!WHAT WE NEEDOur  goal is to raise $77,000  which will cover the basic expenses to make The Ocean We Inhabit a reality… ambitious, right? But hey, this is a major, relevant experience that will help transform society and raise awareness of the ocean. I know it sounds super impossible, but believe me, it’s not! Watch the video if you haven’t, check out my website so you can have a taste of my background and join us on the 28th of April, 2016 at the National Aquarium in Baltimore :)Materials and expenses for installation, workshop, video/sound/narrative performances: $12,000Venue rental and staff fee: $8,000PlanetArt Fund's staff fee: $3,000Artists fee's, travel and accommodation expenses: $17,500PlanetArt Fund online branding and presence: $2,000PlanetArt Fund's registration, fees, and accountability: $8,500Crowdfunding consultants’ fee, contingency of the project, insurance and extras: $25,000Perks’ handling and shipping: $1,000WHAT COMES NEXT AFTER REACHING OUR GOALOur next goal is to raise $25,000 more to be able to shoot the documentary of the exhibition and to make PlanetArt Fund a sustainable project for the future. In my view, film is a form of art that involves people with knowledge, skills and resources in order to make it proper. Our idea is to make the documentary of The Ocean We Inhabit as vivid, beautiful, and intimate as possible in order to reproduce the experiential exhibition. This documentary is a very important part of this project. It will be our ID for all the upcoming projects and alliances asThe Ocean We Inhabit will travel to other museums, aquariums, and other venues. Hence, it will be the cornerstone of our future sustainability. 
PlanetArt Fund will be a New York-based non-profit organization that will continue producing art
events and will also provide environmental grants­ for students on a long term. PlanetArt Fund will enhance the possibility of creating situations and encounters with role models of the environment, educating children about the correct decisions for taking care of our planet.  It will continue creating symposiums, conferences, and workshops to reflect upon environmental concerns, art, and their connectivity. PlanetArt Fund will collaborate and ally with other foundations and institutions, gaining a higher impact within our projects’
outreach. The foundation will continue creating multisensory, collective and out of the ordinary projects around the world. Why this experience will be so incredibly exciting? Because it will be in the hands of talented, honest, wholehearted artists in a mind-blowing venue. Here is some information about them…Pablo Helguera (b. Mexico City, 1971) is a socially engaged multidisciplinary artist, curator, and Director of Adult and Academic Programs at the Museum of Modern Art. He will create a literary workshop with the local people of Baltimore
where he as well as other writers will alter Edgar Allan Poe’s poem ""The City in the Sea."" The result of the workshop--a constrained writing piece-- will later be performed in the exhibition at The National Aquarium.  
Joan Jonas (b. New York, 1936) is a pioneer of performance and video art. Jonas was commissioned for the U.S Pavilion of the 56th Venice Biennale 2015. The exhibition will consist of projecting one of Jonas video art pieces fromThey Come to Us Without a Word inside the architectural walls of Blue Wonders space in the National Aquarium.Martha Raquel Herrera (b. Bogotá, 1963) is a dance therapist and architect. Her daily work in Italy involves the stimulation of people's creativity in order for them to create their own extemporaneous choreographies. Herrera will lead a workshop where the children of Baltimore will create their own extemporaneous dance using materials that symbolize the elements of the ocean. The objective is to make them aware that we are an essential part of the ocean life​.Bernardo Rosa (b. Lisbon, 1989) is a pianist/composer studying at Manhattan School of Music in New York City. He has lived and studied in several places such as  Russia, Belgium and Portugal were he has written a varied array of works influenced by jazz, classical and ambient music. Rosa will create a sound piece for The Ocean We Inhabit  uniting nature and humans, inviting the audience to a meditative inner experience to connect with the ocean's environment. CHECK OUT OUR GALLERY TO SEE THE EXHIBITION'S RENDER AND OTHER SNEAK PICKS!THE DEAL WITH THE AQUARIUMPlanetArt Fund will create an alliance with the National Aquarium of Baltimore, adhering to the aquarium’s mission of inspiring the conservation of the world’s aquatic treasures. The aquarium attracts 1.4 million visitors each year and gathers 20,000 fish,

</div></div>","I'm excited to report that I have been awarded a month long artist residency at the Studios at MASS MoCA. Out of 323 applications, I was chosen to be one of the approximately 50 artists to attend this season. The residency includes a private studio, lodging, one meal a day, free admission to the museum, free access to the resources at the Makers' Mill in North Adams and one-on-one business and financial coaching with Assets for Artists.

Although they have offered me a reduction in the overall fee, I still need to pay $1,600 to attend. It just isn't possible for me to pay this amount of money and to lose income for the entire month. But the opportunity to spend a month focused on my artwork at MASS MoCA and take advantage of the various benefits of this program is too important to pass up. Additionally, a month in North Adams would give me a chance to reconnect to an area of personal significance: I spent the last two years of high school in neighboring Williamstown. Receiving a scholarship to attend Buxton School was a pivotal moment for me as a struggling teenager. I would love to spend the month steeping in this place of risk and transformation.


 My goal is to raise $2,400 in the next month. This will cover the cost of the residency plus $800 for materials and the cost of living. Any money raised over $2,400 will help cover lost income for the month.
If you choose to help me reach this goal I would love to thank you by offering the following perks:

As participants approach the series, they will find a collection of large free-floating sculptures, each as unique as the artists who created them:<p></p>

<p> Hello! We are Pete and Jamy Carreno,  for those that don’t know us, we have been together for 12 years and have been creating different mediums of art since the day we met. We are very excited to have a new opportunity relatively fall into our laps recently.  The chances of this opportunity becoming a reality are becoming increasingly positive but we do need your help! The idea is for a 2500 square-foot creative space which will be used to host private tattooing as well as live music, educational seminars from the worlds top tattoo artists, and introducing interesting and influential people in different mediums such as burlesque performers. We are part of a small group in our community that is pushing to expand our newly discovered Arts District here in downtown Prescott.   We were relatively unprepared for this venture, and so this is where we ask you to help us bring this to life.  While we appreciate your donations, we are also offering perks that will accommodate different levels of contributions. Amongst these perks are Merch such as pins and  stickers, exclusive prints and original artworks that are only available for this project, deep discounts on future appointments for your tattoo services with us, tickets to some of our upcoming educational seminars with artists such as Joshua Carlton and Zac “Lefty” Colbert, as well as  savings on our BnB experiences we offer! There’s really something for everyone. </p>
<p> Jamy has a long history with Prescott and would like to bring a youthful and vibrant, creative area for future generations to come. This is a vision that much of our community shares and we are looking to build upon this and create a solid foundation. Anything you can do to help will be greatly appreciated and we would love to hear any suggestions or ideas you may have as well.   We will be sharing pictures and ideas for this project as time goes on, so you can be part of the process with us!</p>
<p>  Our location is absolutely beautiful, it’s  the second oldest building in Prescott located just a block from our town square. It has a ton of character and a lot of history which we can’t wait to share with you. Most of our funds we already had went towards getting into the space, and our initial buildout as well as our liquor license. We still need things such as furniture, building a stage area for our guests and for tattooing, as well as all the necessary supplies needed to be able to stock a bar and tattoo shop.  We are also excited to record podcasts with each of our guests that we have come through so we will need to get some recording and sound equipment for this part as well.  Some of these things can be prioritized if we are unable to reach our goal but we are looking to do it correctly so all support is immensely appreciated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>We feel Prescott needs this change and we’re happy to be part of this movement. If you’ve ever visited, you know how much it’s history means to us locals. By contributing to this fundraiser, you’ll be part of allowing a younger generation to create their own history here. Our surroundings are beautiful but much of our younger crowd tends to visit other nearby areas in their free time.  We want to show Prescott can be a destination city where you can explore ( and maybe be a guest at our tattoo BnB) and enjoy all it has to offer.  Beautiful trails, rock climbing, kayaking, lakes, casinos, stargazing in the clear night sky, just to name a few! We want to help offer something different and unique, something we’ve always strived to do. By bringing educational seminars for tattooing techniques, world famous pinstripers, internationally recognized oil painters, burlesque performers, passionate chefs, we are bringing in different crowds to see just how amazing our town is.  All while providing growth and new opportunities for those wanting to learn!</p>
<p> Need a space for a wedding or graduation party? Are you a musician that is excited to perform in an intimate and elevated space? Have a fundraiser to host? Maybe you just want to go dance to some rad music from our vast vinyl record collection? All of these ideas are a reality at The Attic, help us to make it come to life!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a huge opportunity for us, so it’s not immune to it’s serious risks and challenges. To be able to juggle what we’re wanting to bring will be difficult to say the least!  Private, appointment only tattooing during the day, then opening up to a music venue/bar in the evenings. We know you can drink anywhere, but we want to share our life experiences with you. Pete and Jamy have traveled the world, tattooing,  creating art, making friends and memories, seeing live music, so our dream is to incorporate these experiences into The Attic. A space where like minded people can join together and aspire to their dreams and ideas. With the support of our friends and community, we can all work together to make something amazing happen. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We understand that times are tough and you can’t help everyone that needs it, so we thank you for reading about our project because your time is valuable!  If you are able to share or use some of the helpful Indiegogo tools, we would sincerely appreciate it. Thanks again and we hope to make art and memories with you at The Attic!</p>

We feel Prescott needs this change and we’re happy to be part of this movement. If you’ve ever visited, you know how much it’s history means to us locals. By contributing to this fundraiser, you’ll be part of allowing a younger generation to create their own history here. Our surroundings are beautiful but much of our younger crowd tends to visit other nearby areas in their free time.  We want to show Prescott can be a destination city where you can explore ( and maybe be a guest at our tattoo BnB) and enjoy all it has to offer.  Beautiful trails, rock climbing, kayaking, lakes, casinos, stargazing in the clear night sky, just to name a few! We want to help offer something different and unique, something we’ve always strived to do. By bringing educational seminars for tattooing techniques, world famous pinstripers, internationally recognized oil painters, burlesque performers, passionate chefs, we are bringing in different crowds to see just how amazing our town is.  All while providing growth and new opportunities for those wanting to learn!
 Need a space for a wedding or graduation party? Are you a musician that is excited to perform in an intimate and elevated space? Have a fundraiser to host? Maybe you just want to go dance to some rad music from our vast vinyl record collection? All of these ideas are a reality at The Attic, help us to make it come to life!
 
Risks & Challenges
 
This is a huge opportunity for us, so it’s not immune to it’s serious risks and challenges. To be able to juggle what we’re wanting to bring will be difficult to say the least!  Private, appointment only tattooing during the day, then opening up to a music venue/bar in the evenings. We know you can drink anywhere, but we want to share our life experiences with you. Pete and Jamy have traveled the world, tattooing,  creating art, making friends and memories, seeing live music, so our dream is to incorporate these experiences into The Attic. A space where like minded people can join together and aspire to their dreams and ideas. With the support of our friends and community, we can all work together to make something amazing happen. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
 
We understand that times are tough and you can’t help everyone that needs it, so we thank you for reading about our project because your time is valuable!  If you are able to share or use some of the helpful Indiegogo tools, we would sincerely appreciate it. Thanks again and we hope to make art and memories with you at The Attic!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Hello!
My name is Zoli, I am an artist from Budapest. In this year something fantastic happened,  I suddenly started to paint very passionately. Art was always important to me, but in this year it became my life. I give credit to yoga for showing me my way. This year I had 3 exhibition in Budapest and I've got a possibility to show some of my pictures in Lisbon in MeetingART Gallery at LICE /Lisbon International Contemporary Exhibition/.  To take part I have to pay fee.  Any help you can give means a lot to me. This is my life, to share my art and my awakening by painting and by yoga. If you are passionate about art like I am, I'm offering great perks at good prices.

ABOUT MY ART:

“GARBAGE” & “NATURE” ARE MY PAPER.
IT IS A MEDITATION ON EACH IMAGE FROM MOMENTS OF THE ROADOF AWAKENING. BASICALLY MY WORKS ARE CHARACTERIZEDBY RECYCLING, AS IF WE LOOKED THE USUAL STUFF THROUGHANOTHER DIMENSION. THE OLD ONE GETS NEW MEANING.I MAKE HANDMADE PAPER FROM OLD & BORING BOOKS, STUPID FLYERS & NEWSPAPERS. CANVASES ARE STRECHED FROMSHEET TO BE EJECTED ON. REBUILDING THE COLLAPSED SHELVES IS UNNECESSARY ­ PAINTS FLOW ON THEM.                                                               ACTUALLY I COLOUR­WASH EVERYTHING ON MY ROAD.
IT IS THE REINCARNATION OF THE THINGS ALIGNED WITH THE CHANGE OF MY OWN. AWAKENING BY COLOURS AND BODY.
MY LAST EXHIBITION:
ROAD3 // TIEMPO Y SILENCIO
The topic of the second stage on my road was the human body as a means of my transformation and of my liberation. Body has gained more and more ground in my life in the form of yoga. Conducting a life with a strong body awareness has drawn my attention to the importance of painting. In turn, painting has strengthened the necessity of yoga. Energy has started to flow there and back on its way inside and around me.

Following Body – road2 exhibition, I threw myself deeper and deeper into my own soul and body. This process has eventually faced me with the idea of passing away. Immediately, body as a topic has transformed from one day to another. I didn’t even have to look for how to visually express passing away, as Cesária Évora's songs have turned up passionately. There was no doubt about the theme of my paintings to come. This has created a marked contrast between my new body paintings and Cesária: body as the expression of a physical presence and a physical force pervaded by soul, emotions on the one hand, and Cesária Évora as a “body-­no­-more” on the other, leaving behind to us her deep and

honestly clear emotions, and her selfless, timeless love.

<h2 style="""">THE BILLBOARDS HACKER PUBLIC ART PROJECT</h2>
<p style=""""><strong style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;"">THE BILLBOARDS HACKER PUBLIC ART PROJECT</strong></p>
<p style="""">Our society’s exploitation of the environment must end.  The limits of our fragile environment are readily apparent:  oil wells are running dry; drinkable water is evaporating; trade wars have erupted over rare earth metals; the polar ice caps are melting; hurricanes routinely ravage our cities.  This vital message of impending environmental disaster must be addressed before it is too late!</p>
<p style="""">Billboards Hacker seeks to convey this vital message through society’s most decadent advertising channel: gigantic billboards.  These billboards that once programmed us to buy, use, consume, and discard our limited resources have now been reprogrammed by Billboards Hacker to display a new message: “What have I done today to end Climate Change?”</p>
<p style="""">Through his paintings, videos, and photographs depicting the city and sky, Billboards Hacker uses his years of research and observation of light to exhibit peaceful visuals while displaying a message about climate change.  By seeing the city and sky—together with his message of climate change—Billboards Hacker seeks to remind everyone of our duty to preserve our fragile planet.</p>
<p style="""">Not only has this message of climate change become an integral part of his artwork, but this message will also leap from the canvas to the real thing as part of a public art project in New York City.  While still in its nascent stages, Billboards Hacker plans to display the same message of climate change on actual billboards throughout the city, from Times Square to other iconic places.  The money from sales of his artwork, along with private and public sponsors, will help make this historic public exhibit possible.</p>
<p style="""">By forcing everyone to realize the negative effects we have on the environment, and that we must act daily to address them before it is too late, Billboards Hacker hopes that we can move past our foolishness and leave a beautiful planet to our children.</p>
<p style="""">---------------</p>
<p style="""">For this wall project, we need support to fund rental of the crane/lift for 5 weeks, paint, and different materials. (Permits are going to be issued soon and we already have the agreement of the owner of the building).</p></span></span><p style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42); margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The Art piece will be a permanent installation.</p></span></span><span style=""""><p style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42); margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: inline !important;""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(18, 26, 13); line-height: 24px;"">If  you give, you will also receive.

Our society’s exploitation of the environment must end. We convey this vital message through society’s most decadent advertising channel: billboards.


Dear Art Collectors, Friends and Followers
Dear Art lovers from New York and the 5 boroughs
Dear neighbors from New Rochelle-
You loved the last billboard painted on Division Street?

Some great news, and a little help…
I am very happy to show you the 400 square foot mural done last year with your help!  
Lets make all together round number 2
We recently launched the INDIEGOGO campaign to fund "" BILLBOARD SCALE 1 LIVE #4""
Thank you to all of you in advance for your pledge. We are very grateful.We have the experience to paint large surfaces for years now, We have the experience to paint beautiful skies and nice ""Trompe l'Oeil"" (trick the eyes) technique. BUT this one will be possible because of YOUR help. Only your funding can make this happen and happen now. :)

This time the billboard is HUGE.  We will transform the building's two ugly facades into an amazing, beautiful double mural.  Each will be approximately six yards/meters wide by more than four stories high (over 1200 square feet/ 120 square meters)! All painted by hand, in Trompe l'Oeil technique.
Here is the photo before:

Once the painting is done, it will be very close to looking like this: 
The idea this time is to make it look like old, charming, ""back in the day"" billboards- when there were still pieces of paper glued, side by side, to make a full large image. But, here, no paper will be used! It will be only a ""trick for the eyes"". All being painted as if they are paper leaves- some not perfectly glued, others even flying away.

The left part of the mural will have the fake scaffolding hanging from the roof top, in Trompe l'Oeil technique (trick the eyes).



This time, the surface to paint is enormous. We expect to do it in less than five weeks. As in NOW, before the winter comes. The work, though, has been in preparation for months.  One example being last October, when  we were licensed to be crane/lift pilots.  80 feet is rather high.

Billlboard Live Scale #3 we did last year when you already helped us:

This is a part of a larger project that will soon take place in New York City:

We are already working hard on all the sketches and Mockup for the New York City part of the project:


THE BILLBOARDS HACKER PUBLIC ART PROJECT
THE BILLBOARDS HACKER PUBLIC ART PROJECT
Our society’s exploitation of the environment must end.  The limits of our fragile environment are readily apparent:  oil wells are running dry; drinkable water is evaporating; trade wars have erupted over rare earth metals; the polar ice caps are melting; hurricanes routinely ravage our cities.  This vital message of impending environmental disaster must be addressed before it is too late!
Billboards Hacker seeks to convey this vital message through society’s most decadent advertising channel: gigantic billboards.  These billboards that once programmed us to buy, use, consume, and discard our limited resources have now been reprogrammed by Billboards Hacker to display a new message: “What have I done today to end Climate Change?”
Through his paintings, videos, and photographs depicting the city and sky, Billboards Hacker uses his years of research and observation of light to exhibit peaceful visuals while displaying a message about climate change.  By seeing the city and sky—together with his message of climate change—Billboards Hacker seeks to remind everyone of our duty to preserve our fragile planet.
Not only has this message of climate change become an integral part of his artwork, but this message will also leap from the canvas to the real thing as part of a public art project in New York City.  While still in its nascent stages, Billboards Hacker plans to display the same message of climate change on actual billboards throughout the city, from Times Square to other iconic places.  The money from sales of his artwork, along with private and public sponsors, will help make this historic public exhibit possible.
By forcing everyone to realize the negative effects we have on the environment, and that we must act daily to address them before it is too late, Billboards Hacker hopes that we can move past our foolishness and leave a beautiful planet to our children.
---------------
For this wall project, we need support to fund rental of the crane/lift for 5 weeks, paint, and different materials. (Permits are going to be issued soon and we already have the agreement of the owner of the building).The Art piece will be a permanent installation.If  you give, you will also receive. We’ve put together some great rewards. If you contribute you can have one of them. 


We will again be filming the whole project with GoPro equipment. The footage will soon be posted on BillboardsHacker.com. You can also subscribe to our channel on YouTube or follow us on instagram #BillboardsHacker or Twitter @billboardhacker or like our Facebook page.
Take a look at the right hand column to find the one that is right for you. 
If you just want to give money to the project, that's great too, but we are happy to pass on some of Billboards Hacker work in exchange.
If you have not backed this important project yet, we hope you will consider doing so. We have only 12 days :)If you cannot give, you can still help the project and get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. You can even use Indiegogo share tools!

<h2>FAQ - Questions you might have</h2><p></p><p>
</p><p><b>When will the perks be delivered?</b></p>
<p>We start delivering perks and give more
information and details on the delivery after the campaign. As soon as the
artworks are scanned/printed/created they are ready for take off. Because most
of the artworks will be prints we will wait until the campaign ends so we can
do the printing all in one time. Those who ordered an original artwork have to
wait until Mohammed has made them. </p>
<p><b>How will the funders be kept informed
during and after the campaign?</b></p>
<p>We will be sending all of our supporters
updates through our Indiegogo page and via email to the email address you have
provided when signing up to the Indiegogo site. We will also post updates on
our Facebook page.</p>
<p><b>I purchased a copy of one of Mohammed’s
artwork. How can I tell you which artwork I would like to have? </b></p>
<p>We will contact everyone during/after the
campaign and ask which artwork you would like to receive. </p>
<p><b>I purchased a personal made artwork. How
can I tell you my story? </b></p>
<p>The idea behind
this perk is that you send a personal story to us. Mohammed will make you
something inspired by your own story. It’s important that you send your story
to <a href=""mailto:mohammedsartventure@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mohammedsartventure@gmail.com</a>.
Make sure to also send your name and address with it so we can send it to you
after the campaign is done.</p>
<p><b>If the project doesn't reach it’s funding
goal, do I get my money back?</b></p>
<p>If we manage to raise our target goal we
are going to try to arrange a trip for Mohammed together with his brother
Marwan to Paris. We want to combine this trip with visiting art schools,
museums and drinking coffee in a real French café. If we don’t reach our target
goal the money will be invested in Mohammed’s art education in a local art
school. Mohammed will also be able to use the funding to buy himself art
supplies.</p>

be able to experience the same thing.''The dreamEven though Mohammed has never been outside of his region his big dream is to visit Paris one day. All the painters he has been reading about have either studied or lived in Paris. The trip would be a combination between visiting museums and art schools. We are hoping to arrange a course with prestigious art school. 
Buy art and make a difference
By contributing to this campaign you can
purchase one of Mohammed's artworks and at same time contribute to Mohammed's
dream. If we don't reach our target goal the contributions will be put into a fund,
which Mohammed can use for purchasing art supplies and to attend a course at a
local art school.
Of
course if you can't contribute you can still help us by sharing Mohammed's
story. You can help us spread the message about this campaign through your
community and social media channels.Please keep in mind that..After the Indiegogo campaign ends the prints will be distributed. This could take up to the end of July 2015. Due to the limited resources of this project, it will not be possible to track your order. Thanks, for understanding.For any questions, remarks or just a friendly conversation please drop a line at: mohammedsartventure@gmail.com
FAQ - Questions you might have
When will the perks be delivered?
We start delivering perks and give more
information and details on the delivery after the campaign. As soon as the
artworks are scanned/printed/created they are ready for take off. Because most
of the artworks will be prints we will wait until the campaign ends so we can
do the printing all in one time. Those who ordered an original artwork have to
wait until Mohammed has made them. 
How will the funders be kept informed
during and after the campaign?
We will be sending all of our supporters
updates through our Indiegogo page and via email to the email address you have
provided when signing up to the Indiegogo site. We will also post updates on
our Facebook page.
I purchased a copy of one of Mohammed’s
artwork. How can I tell you which artwork I would like to have? 
We will contact everyone during/after the
campaign and ask which artwork you would like to receive. 
I purchased a personal made artwork. How
can I tell you my story? 
The idea behind
this perk is that you send a personal story to us. Mohammed will make you
something inspired by your own story. It’s important that you send your story
to mohammedsartventure@gmail.com.
Make sure to also send your name and address with it so we can send it to you
after the campaign is done.
If the project doesn't reach it’s funding
goal, do I get my money back?
If we manage to raise our target goal we
are going to try to arrange a trip for Mohammed together with his brother
Marwan to Paris. We want to combine this trip with visiting art schools,
museums and drinking coffee in a real French café. If we don’t reach our target
goal the money will be invested in Mohammed’s art education in a local art
school. Mohammed will also be able to use the funding to buy himself art
supplies.",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>I had 3 weeks to fund raise, lecture, build and produce a documentary DVD and without the engagement and humanity of the citizens of Tuzla, I would not have been able to accomplish what was my maiden voyage into building Outdoor Public Sculpture and their potential.

<div>June 28th, 2014. It was 100 years after Austria's Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand had been assassinated June 28th 1914 triggering  a chain of reactions that brought on WW1. But in this region, (The Balkans), with 50% unemployment and having been passed over by international investors, the last thing the citizens needed was to commemorate another war. Disenfranchised by the global market due to the gross internal conflict, commercial and intellectual investment is scarce. O2S14 recognized this misjudgment and saw the Balkans as fertile ground for the creative process to encompass the infinity of human nature in all its state(s), where it welcomes one's past and present and nothing is left behind nor denied but syphoned through the sculpture's framework as an act of reclamation of one's own part in defining the moment, culture and content.<br/>

<i>O2S14 Outsourcing to Sarajevo, was more an occasion to celebrate the day rather than mourn the date.

<div>But the numbers are high and I'm trying to be realistic in only seeking €45,850. through this campaign. I've already done this piece in Sarajevo with the funding of the Austrian government who won't fund this project as it's part of a Public Museum's program. But I know as it was yesterday, the thrill we all had when the public entered what they thought was a classically stoic, enclosed modernist sculpture, only to open up to  be a brightly colorful and oddly spacious labyrinth of imagery with the open sky above. I promised myself to do this work again in the city (Vienna) that trusted me with the task of representing them, knowing that the cost would be considerably higher and the chances of not raising the funds even greater as a foreign artist working primarily independently.<br/>

<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div><i>The goal with my outdoor sculptures is to create platforms that encourage public engagement, contributing to the creative content of the moment. Each day we are challenged to navigate changes to our perceptions of space.

When I thought there were enough objects in the box, I would put the lid back on and shake it up and remove it in order to discover how, ""they rearranged themselves"". These were travel boxes. Though the contents were the same, their repositioning made the inside of the box appear like a different place each time I removed the lid.
I did my first large-scale interactive public sculpture, ""Occupy AIR"" in 2012. As an Artist In Residency in Tuzla, BiH, I built the word Occupy in wood like a room with out a roof on the 20th year commemorating the Bosnian/Serbian war. It was 15 meters long and 5 meters wide at 2 meters in height.  And after seeing thousands of names etched in stone of those who died in the war, the sculpture Occupy AIR was entered by 180 citizens of Tuzla who wrote their names on it's interior walls, transforming the sculpture into a living monument to life. 








That's me directing traffic inside Occupy AIR.







The video Occupy AIR:

I had 3 weeks to fund raise, lecture, build and produce a documentary DVD and without the engagement and humanity of the citizens of Tuzla, I would not have been able to accomplish what was my maiden voyage into building Outdoor Public Sculpture and their potential. But I was unsatisfied with the structural details and so a promise was made to somehow gain another opportunity to implement what I learned in Tuzla, for another City.

Redemption came with a commission by the Federal Chancellery of Austria to represent the country at the 2014 Centennial in Sarajevo. I built my second interactive sculpture in a modified shape of the word ""Outsourcing"" titled, O2S14 ""Outsourcing to Sarajevo 2014"".
What's in a word can depend on what you put into it.


When asked by the Chancellery what I would be outsourcing I said that it was they who are outsourcing me (an American) to represent them (Austria) and that I would outsource the content (inside of the sculpture) to 14 artists from Austria and Bosnia and Herzegovina and France, by hiring them to submit an image of their work, formatting the digital files into PVC wall paper that would cover the entire interior of the sculpture including the floor. 





June 28th, 2014. It was 100 years after Austria's Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand had been assassinated June 28th 1914 triggering  a chain of reactions that brought on WW1. But in this region, (The Balkans), with 50% unemployment and having been passed over by international investors, the last thing the citizens needed was to commemorate another war. Disenfranchised by the global market due to the gross internal conflict, commercial and intellectual investment is scarce. O2S14 recognized this misjudgment and saw the Balkans as fertile ground for the creative process to encompass the infinity of human nature in all its state(s), where it welcomes one's past and present and nothing is left behind nor denied but syphoned through the sculpture's framework as an act of reclamation of one's own part in defining the moment, culture and content.








O2S14 Outsourcing to Sarajevo, was more an occasion to celebrate the day rather than mourn the date. And by the expressions on their faces and the way the community engaged with the sculpture, O2S14 was turned into an inverted 21C Trojan horse that was invaded by citizens with an appetite for action and art. 





Here, instead of a large outdoor public sculpture pretending to have omnipotent powers by over staying its welcome and occupying public grounds, O2S14 was designed as a temporary sculpture that allowed the public to occupy its' space becoming a viable component to its content and after 2 weeks, to be removed enticing memory to sustain it.






I believe this work touches people like a Carol King song (not in the video). The video, O2S14:



Now I have the chance to do the project again in Vienna as O2V15 ""Outsourcing to Vienna"" 2015, at the Museums Quartier, Vienna with the same amount of artists from Aut and BiH but with an additional 3 American artists to remove the sculpture from its regulatory role of commemoration to a more contemporary context of inclusion.



The ""Corner Stones"" of O2V15 laying out the placement for the sculpture: Ulrike Fallmann Lt, (curator), Klaus Gruber Rt, (architect) and me in the far center holding a sign. Museums Quartier, Vienna, AUT.


But the numbers are high and I'm trying to be realistic in only seeking €45,850. through this campaign. I've already done this piece in Sarajevo with the funding of the Austrian government who won't fund this project as it's part of a Public Museum's program. But I know as it was yesterday, the thrill we all had when the public entered what they thought was a classically stoic, enclosed modernist sculpture, only to open up to  be a brightly colorful and oddly spacious labyrinth of imagery with the open sky above. I promised myself to do this work again in the city (Vienna) that trusted me with the task of representing them, knowing that the cost would be considerably higher and the chances of not raising the funds even greater as a foreign artist working primarily independently.



Principle Costs: €45,850.


I've already invested: €3250. 
Architect/Engineer's fee: Administrative, consulting including preparing documents, filling costs (in order to push the paperwork through) and get it approved by the municipalities here known as the MA37. This had to be paid regardless of whether or not the sculpture is approved and built.

The digital formatting, printing and installation of the PVC wallpaper: €10,200. 

Contractors fee: €32,400.



4 carpenters.

Materials, mainly wood with steel fasteners.

Rental  of off-site facility to build the sculpture in sections.
Fire retardant treatment and painting of wood (traffic red).

Delivery. 

Installation in concert with the PVC wall paper team.

De-installation.

Delivery to lucky selected donatee.


Additional costs will inevitably be incurred: €19,100.




Promotion: €900. Fliers, posters printing and distribution, blog updating. 

Documentation: €4700. Ground and aerial crew with:

HD video cam and digital photography with mobile crane: €1500.

Drone team: €3200, crew of 3, pilot, camera operator and asst.

Post production: €1600. Video editing/formatting for the Web and DVDs
24 hour Security: €7200, One guard per 8 hour shift for 23 days.
Original music sound tract for the official O2V15 DVD.



Total costs: €64,950.
Of course this does not cover my time and all investments during the campaign period which certainly extends beyond the 60 days of this particular  fundraising campaign. 


The goal with my outdoor sculptures is to create platforms that encourage public engagement, contributing to the creative content of the moment. Each day we are challenged to navigate changes to our perceptions of space. Within the walls of O2V15 we are invited into a visual play with language and architecture  unencumbered with the day-to-day trappings found on the pedestrian pathway.

Thank you!

<p>CUPSI is the largest collegiate poetry competition in the country, with college teams coming from all across <span class=""text_exposed_show"">the 50 states to compete. 2012 will be our second year at CUPSI--<em>in our rookie year, </em><em>we finished <strong>7th in the nation</strong> and took home the coveted <strong>Spirit of the Slam Award</strong> as well as the prize for <strong>Best Persona Poem</strong>. </em></span></p>

i appreciate any help you can offer. if you can donate some cash, that's amazing. if you can't afford to donate now, if you can just pass this on to your friends and family, that is just as helpful to me.

<p><strong>Please Help Frame Original Illustrations by Roger Tory Peterson and Create a Traveling Exhibit of Never Before Displayed Art. </strong></p>
<p>Roger Tory Peterson (1908-1996) is considered 20th century America's king of bird watching and nature education. The Roger Tory Peterson Institute of Natural History (RTPI) is a small not-for-profit organization located in Peterson's hometown of Jamestown, New York, where we offer nature education programs and exhibits in the spirit of our hero. The Institute's archival vaults preserve over 200,000 works of art and other items that frame the arc of Peterson's spectacular career. Peterson considered himself first and formost an educator and we intend to continue his life's work by making his work available to a wide audience. </p>
<p>Roger Tory Peterson's paintings and illustrations, reproduced in millions of field guides, books and magazines over several decades, inspired generations of Americans to know and love nature. Through much of his career the most practical and economical way to make his point was in black and white. Although Peterson is not best known for the black and white illustrations that graced several of his popular books, his pen-and-ink drawings are brilliantly executed gems that have never before been exhibited! The Roger Tory Peterson Institute wants to frame several of the original illustrations from our collection and send them on the road for new generations of artists, nature-lovers and environmentalists across the country to enjoy.</p>
<p>RTPI plans to have expertly framed 50 of the best Peterson's original illustrations from <em>How to Know the Birds</em> (1949), <em>Wild America</em> (1955), <em>The Bird Watcher's Anthology</em> (1959), and <em>Penguins</em> (1979). Our picture framer, a longtime friend and supporter of our Institute, has given us a fantastic deal to do the job. The cost of framing each illustration ($150) includes high-quality conservation framing to ensure the continued protection of the original artwork (acid-free mattes, unbreakable plexiglass that protects from harmful UV radiation, etc.) and also includes durable packaging so that these pieces can be shipped to other venues across the country as part of a traveling exhibit.</p>
<p>Please help us raise the funds necessary to get this framing done, to get these priceless jewels out of our vault and into nature centers and museums where thousands of people can enjoy and learn from them. </p>

<h3>Greetings, fine folks!</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>My name is Christine Kuhn and I'm a professional artist.  I guess that what makes me a professional artist is the fact that I support myself through teaching art lessons and through grants and through the sale of my art.  I am a self taught artist; I loved art so much that I gave up a science career to pursue my passion.  It has been an invigorating and sometimes frightening journey, but I am glad that I had the courage to begin and the courage to continue in spite of moments of great doubt.  </p>
<p>In this campaign, I am trying to raise the remainder of funds for a month long artists' residency at the Vermont Studio Center, beginning on May 13, 2013.  The studio center has offered me a partial scholarship and work study funds and I have also received funds from the Kentucky Arts Council and LexArts.  However, more funds are needed for me to be able to take advantage of this unique opportunity.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To be able to attend an artist residency here in the US means a great deal to me and to the progression of my art.  As a self-taught artist, I have much to gain from interaction with other artists; it's something I have rarely encountered.  Imagine that you had never had any work colleagues . . . . how far do you feel you would have progressed in your profession with neither personal nor institutional support? Just alone, in your garage, on your own time and your own dime.  Would you have learned what you know now and at the rate that you have learned? Answer this question for yourself honestly and you'll see how this opportunity will accelerate my learning process.  I want to be an amazing artist.  I have the discipline and the smarts necessary to do so; I just need a little more interaction and maybe some healthy competition.  </p>
<p>So, why in the heck is art important in the first place??  Why should you donate to an ART project when there are so many good causes out there? Well, truth is, art is one of the few activities that touches and relieves the main source of trouble in the modern world which is personal fear and anxiety.  Greed, violence, prejudice and knee-jerk reactions of every sort all boil down to fear--fear of not having enough, fear of being hurt, losing something, etc. Inexplicably, art has the power to reach the subconscious mind and release the energy of fear, as well as other emotional energy blockages.  Just imagine what would happen if folks too as good care of their emotions as they do their physical bodies! It would be a real cultural revolution.</p>
<p>If you give to this campaign, your funds will be used to pay for the balance of the artist's residency, for travel to the residency and for art supplies used during the residency period.  </p>
<p>If you give $25, you'll get a 6-card set of note cards featuring my art work and hand selected by you from my many pieces.  If you give $100, you can either receive 4 free private art lessons or one of my small paintings (of your own choice) that usually sells for $175.  So, it's  a great way to either learn a new skill or build your art collection on a budget! :D </p>
<p>If all the funds needed aren't raised, I will use whatever funds are donated for the residency fees and borrow the rest of the money for the residency.  So, either way, your donation will help me attend! :D</p>
<p>If you are unable to give at this time, no worries, but please take a moment to share this campaign with others--let them know that they can make the world a more beautiful place by supporting an artist! </p>

<h1><b>TROPHIES</b></h1>
<p>featuring the masks of <b>ROLAND GEBHARDT</b><span><br/></span>and the legendary music of <span><br/></span><b>MOONDOG </b>performed by <span><br/></span><b>LOUIS NICOLIA</b> and <b>HALF MOON CONSORT</b><span><br/></span>choreography by <b>MERCEDES SEARER</b></p>
<p><b>JACK HANLEY GALLERY</b><span><br/></span>327 Broom Street New York, NY<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Admission free</p><p><span><br/></span>What happens when an international sculptor discovers a musician who preserves and performs the work of a legendary musician?</p>
<p>In the secluded community of Chautauqua, New York, at the LakeArts Foundation Incubator, such a thing happened — New York artist Roland Gebhardt met musician Louis Nicolia. The result is TROPHIES, an inspired collaboration, bringing together sculpture, modern dancers, and the music <span><br/></span>of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moondog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Moondog</a>.</p>
<p>With TROPHIES Gebhardt has created a provocative look at the art collector as hunter and art as a trophy to be pursued, captured and displayed on a wall.</p>
<p>Collecting trophies is a common social pursuit. Objects of perceived and real value are used as icons to express one's identity. Trophies are currency of social stature. In this performance piece, establishing and collecting hunting trophies serve as the analogy.</p>
<p>The music is by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moondog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Moondog</a>, a blind street musician who rose from the sidewalks of New York’s 6th Avenue to influence composers such as Phillip Glass, Peter Sellars, Steve Reich, Jon Gibson and Frank Zappa.</p>
<p>In TROPHIES it is dance and music that instill abstract masks with life. In this performance — second in an evolving international tour of varying iterations of the piece that introduces new dancers in each city — choreographer Mercedes Searer will join dancers Macklin Kowal and Alexander Leslie Thompson in an athletic, feral interpretation. The music of Moondog will be played by the Half Moon Consort chamber ensemble, founded by violinist Nicolia.</p>
<p>Nicolia’s Consort musicians are dedicated to furthering Moondog’s musical legacy. All are skilled performers of the music of ""the Viking of Sixth Avenue” and have performed in numerous venues and cities, including Carnegie Hall.<span><br/></span></p><h3></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><h3><b><span><br/></span>About the Artists</b></h3>
</span></h3><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</p><p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Roland Gebhardt</b> is an internationally known sculptor and designer. In 2008 he debuted <i>The Only Tribe</i>, his first live theater piece for masks, which featured choreography by Peter Kyle and video design by Reid Farrington, at New York's 3LD Art &amp; Technology Center.

TROPHIES
featuring the masks of ROLAND GEBHARDTand the legendary music of MOONDOG performed by LOUIS NICOLIA and HALF MOON CONSORTchoreography by MERCEDES SEARER
JACK HANLEY GALLERY327 Broom Street New York, NYAdmission freeWhat happens when an international sculptor discovers a musician who preserves and performs the work of a legendary musician?
In the secluded community of Chautauqua, New York, at the LakeArts Foundation Incubator, such a thing happened — New York artist Roland Gebhardt met musician Louis Nicolia. The result is TROPHIES, an inspired collaboration, bringing together sculpture, modern dancers, and the music of Moondog.
With TROPHIES Gebhardt has created a provocative look at the art collector as hunter and art as a trophy to be pursued, captured and displayed on a wall.
Collecting trophies is a common social pursuit. Objects of perceived and real value are used as icons to express one's identity. Trophies are currency of social stature. In this performance piece, establishing and collecting hunting trophies serve as the analogy.
The music is by Moondog, a blind street musician who rose from the sidewalks of New York’s 6th Avenue to influence composers such as Phillip Glass, Peter Sellars, Steve Reich, Jon Gibson and Frank Zappa.
In TROPHIES it is dance and music that instill abstract masks with life. In this performance — second in an evolving international tour of varying iterations of the piece that introduces new dancers in each city — choreographer Mercedes Searer will join dancers Macklin Kowal and Alexander Leslie Thompson in an athletic, feral interpretation. The music of Moondog will be played by the Half Moon Consort chamber ensemble, founded by violinist Nicolia.
Nicolia’s Consort musicians are dedicated to furthering Moondog’s musical legacy. All are skilled performers of the music of ""the Viking of Sixth Avenue” and have performed in numerous venues and cities, including Carnegie Hall.About the Artists

Roland Gebhardt is an internationally known sculptor and designer. In 2008 he debuted The Only Tribe, his first live theater piece for masks, which featured choreography by Peter Kyle and video design by Reid Farrington, at New York's 3LD Art & Technology Center. Best known for his monolithic sculptures, Gebhardt's work has been shown around the world and is in many prominent collections. He studied at both the Art Academy of Hamburg and the Kunstgewerbeschule in Zurich. He has been principal and proprietor of Roland Gebhardt Design, located in downtown Manhattan, since 1987 and was the Designer Director for Robert P. Gersin Associates. He developed a line of sculptural furniture and holds several mechanical and design product patents.  He was the co-chair of Rebuild Downtown Our Town, and is a member of the steering committee for the Civic Alliance. Gebhardt is a faculty member of Pratt Institute, School of Architecture, Graduate Program for Urban Planning, and is a Fellow of The Institute for Urban Design. For more info visit www.RolandGebhardt.com.

TROPHIES features live music under the direction of Louis Nicolia of the Half Moon Consort.  Musicians include Andrija Andjelic (piano), Louis Nicolia (violin), Bradley T. Amidon (percussion), Rebecca Walsh (horns), James Pearson (cello), Sonny Froman (trimba — Moondog's unique percussion instrument).  Multiple Moondog compositions — including madrigals (vocal rounds), logrundes (instrumental works for ensemble), solo piano pieces and drum solos — will be performed without pauses; the trimba will lead the transitions between the different compositions.  TROPHIES is danced by Mercedes Searer, Macklin Kowal and Alexander Leslie Thompson. Mercedes Searer is a Brooklyn based dancer/choreographer and freelance arts administrator.

<h1><b>What is Mokuhanga?</b></h1>
<p>Mokuhanga is
the art technique of traditional Japanese woodblock. “Hanga” means printing and
“moku” means wood. This art form became popular during the Edo period
(1603-1867), where prints were made by publishing houses in Japan.</p><p>
</p><p>The publisher
hired artists, carvers, and printers to create editions to sell to the
public.<span>  The 18<sup>th</sup>
century genre Ukiyo-e, or “pictures of the floating world,” depicted images of
everyday life: landscape, fashionable woman, actors, theatre, and other
entertainment purposes. One of the most famous </span>Japanese
printmakers was Katsushika
Hokusai during this era. His most famous work is titled <i>Under the Wave off Kanagawa (The Great Wave).</i><br/><br/></p>
<h1><b>Why I love Mokuhanga? </b></h1>
<p>I first began printmaking in high school during a summer art program for
gifted and talented students. Over 17 years I have practiced various forms art
of printmaking such as relief, intaglio, silkscreen, collagraph, and
lithography. I have recently taken four consecutive Mokuhanga classes with printmaker
April Vollmer at The Lower Eastside Printshop.<br/></p>
<p>When I was first introduced to Mokuhanga I fell in love with the
application of water based ink applied to the wood surface. It’s flexibility of
how the colors reacted to humid paper just by the amount of water, pressure, or
pigment, is what makes this process so unique.<span></span></p>
<p>My rigorous study of printmaking has helped me to better understand how
to transfer my ideas to any media I choose to work with. Now you too can own a
work of art produced by me! I hope you can find the best place for my work to hang in
your home or office.</p>
<h1><b>Why I need your help?</b></h1>
<p>It has always been a dream to me to study the art Japan abroad. I was
recently selected out of over 100 international artists to present a paper
presentation at the 2<sup>nd</sup> Annual International Mokuhanga Conference at The
University of Tokyo. I will be one of the representatives of the United States
of America to display my artistic skills and share my knowledge in the area of
printmaking.</p>
<p>I need your help to make my dream a reality. With your support you will
be able to contribute to my long awaited journey to Japan. I am interested in
learning from master printers the technique and the origin of Mokuhanga in Japan
to better understand how it has remained the same technically for over 300 years. </p>
<p>I hope to participate in traditional carving and paper making workshops
that are taught by Japanese and international artists from around the world.
During my trip I would like to observe the making of carving tools and barrens
for printing. </p>
<p>This opportunity will not only provide technical knowledge but also the
basis of educational foundation that I will use in my own teaching practice as
an artist. I plan on using my experience to lecture, write publications, obtain artist
residencies, and share the culture of Japan with my students. <br/></p>

<br/></div>","What is Mokuhanga?
Mokuhanga is
the art technique of traditional Japanese woodblock. “Hanga” means printing and
“moku” means wood. This art form became popular during the Edo period
(1603-1867), where prints were made by publishing houses in Japan.
The publisher
hired artists, carvers, and printers to create editions to sell to the
public.  The 18th
century genre Ukiyo-e, or “pictures of the floating world,” depicted images of
everyday life: landscape, fashionable woman, actors, theatre, and other
entertainment purposes. One of the most famous Japanese
printmakers was Katsushika
Hokusai during this era. His most famous work is titled Under the Wave off Kanagawa (The Great Wave).
Why I love Mokuhanga? 
I first began printmaking in high school during a summer art program for
gifted and talented students. Over 17 years I have practiced various forms art
of printmaking such as relief, intaglio, silkscreen, collagraph, and
lithography. I have recently taken four consecutive Mokuhanga classes with printmaker
April Vollmer at The Lower Eastside Printshop.
When I was first introduced to Mokuhanga I fell in love with the
application of water based ink applied to the wood surface. It’s flexibility of
how the colors reacted to humid paper just by the amount of water, pressure, or
pigment, is what makes this process so unique.
My rigorous study of printmaking has helped me to better understand how
to transfer my ideas to any media I choose to work with. Now you too can own a
work of art produced by me! I hope you can find the best place for my work to hang in
your home or office.
Why I need your help?
It has always been a dream to me to study the art Japan abroad. I was
recently selected out of over 100 international artists to present a paper
presentation at the 2nd Annual International Mokuhanga Conference at The
University of Tokyo. I will be one of the representatives of the United States
of America to display my artistic skills and share my knowledge in the area of
printmaking.
I need your help to make my dream a reality. With your support you will
be able to contribute to my long awaited journey to Japan. I am interested in
learning from master printers the technique and the origin of Mokuhanga in Japan
to better understand how it has remained the same technically for over 300 years. 
I hope to participate in traditional carving and paper making workshops
that are taught by Japanese and international artists from around the world.
During my trip I would like to observe the making of carving tools and barrens
for printing. 
This opportunity will not only provide technical knowledge but also the
basis of educational foundation that I will use in my own teaching practice as
an artist. I plan on using my experience to lecture, write publications, obtain artist
residencies, and share the culture of Japan with my students. 
What I Need to go Japan…

Bangkok has countless examples of this type of carving, with its pinnacle being

Pho also contains over 1,000 other Buddha images, many carved. Secular carving
is also popular and can include carvings of monkeys, elephants or other natural
forms. There is a parallel history of Animism with a belief that guardian
spirits inhabit rivers, canals, trees and other natural features, which
pre-dates the arrival of all other religions and still plays a role in the

guiding force of my intuition. I draw and I create
primal sculpture and wearable art from trees and stones, which I fashion into
ritual staffs, wearable amulets, and employ in healing rituals. My designs are
entirely hand-made and one-of-a-kind. 
 
British
Airways recently announced that my business “Sticks & Stones” has been
selected as a 2010 Face-of-Opportunity winner and has been awarded travel to
anywhere in the world to conduct business meetings, as well as attend the British Airways
Face-of-Opportunity business conference. This award is part of the British Airways Face-to-Face program, which provides
small business owners and entrepreneurs the critical tools for building
business relationships abroad and stimulating growth through the power of face- to-face interaction. 
 
Sounds great, right? But … British Airways
supplies only the plane tickets.  In order for me to take advantage of
this amazing opportunity, I have to raise the money for all my living expenses
once overseas.  Also, because of the contest rules, I must travel from
February 3rd and return by March 4th.  In other words, I have to raise money fast!
 
I plan to travel to Thailand, a relatively low-cost destination with a centuries-old tradition
of woodcarving, in order to meet and
study with indigenous master wood carvers and native shaman.  My goal is to increase my technical
proficiency, deepen my work as a healing ritual artist -- and document the
experience on video. I will also learn about international commerce from the
British Airways sessions, make global connections with the other contest
winners, and explore ways to exhibit my work overseas.  
 
I have connected
with like-minded volunteers in Bangkok who will act as my tour guides for several
weeks during my stay. They will travel with me to Chaing Main and more remote
areas, provide part-time housing, introduce me to artists and shamans, and help
me document my work. 
 
In a nutshell: I want to
travel to Thailand to deepen my art-making by connecting with people who employ
ritual objects for healing and spiritual purposes.   I see myself uniquely positioned in the crossroads
between ritual and art – and as a conduit from ancient ways to modern times.
I’ve touched upon something via my artwork that feels very important, not only
to me, but potentially to others as well. 
I hope as I continue to develop, I can offer what I discover to a wider
and wider circle of people.

What I Need & What You Get






Some history: 
Due to a life-threatening crisis in 2002, I spontaneously
started carving for protection and spiritual connection – making what I call
“Sacred Staffs” from the roots and trunks of trees.  Prior to becoming a
visual artist, I was an actor, employing the ritual aspects of theatre to
impact community.  Now my path to a
sacred space and a quest towards the divine has shifted to creating sacred
objects and drawings. My work explores issues of love and loss, spirituality,
sexuality, and gender identification and how these intersect.  I also teach workshops combing these
elements. Through these various ritual practices and explorations, I’ve been
fortunate to obtain a glimpse of my healing abilities. 
 
I tapped into carving on a visceral level, and what
stemmed from crisis evolved to exhibition: The Prospect Park
Alliance and the Audubon Center sponsored a three-month solo show “Sticks &
Stones” at the Boathouse in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park, and The National Museum of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual
& Transgender History presented a two-month solo show.  I was profiled in The Daily News; was the subject of feature articles in Mann About Town magazine, Home News Tribune, In Brooklyn, The Park Slope
Paper, The Wave, and The Daily Sitka Sentinel, and featured on NY-1 Television.
 
In 2009, I was awarded a Development Grant from Fractured
Atlas to study with Native American Tlingit master woodcarver Tommy Joseph in
Sitka Alaska. I worked with Tommy in his beautiful
studio at the Southeast Indian Cultural
Center, housed inside the Sitka National Historical Park. I was surrounded by
formline art – a style rarely seen in New York City outside of the Museum of
the American Indian. When I stepped into Tommy’s studio I was overwhelmed by
the sheer beauty and power of the objects within. Under Tommy’s tutelage, I carved a mask out of a tree trunk using traditional Tlingit hand
tools. The mask, entitled “Trans-Formation” manifested from a dream. Carving
with Tommy was hard physical work, humbling, profound – and lots of fun too.
(See “The Spirit in the Mask” http://artistsoulspeaks.wordpress.com/2009/10/1....

 
Carvings, and the creation of masks and staffs,
are an ancient art form of expression in many cultures and traditions,
including in Judaism, my roots.  And in the past most designed objects were used
for ritual. But
I live in NYC -- a fast-paced environment surrounded by
mass-produced goods created by machines. The objects most of us use on a daily
basis have little intrinsic beauty or spiritual value. And all too often we
live separated from nature and many of us rarely participate in rituals, rites
of passage or celebrations with community.
 
 
Thailand is well known for the carving of statues
destined for various Buddhist temples in Thailand and other parts of Asia.
Bangkok has countless examples of this type of carving, with its pinnacle being
the reclining Buddha at Wat Pho, the longest reclining Buddha in the world. Wat
Pho also contains over 1,000 other Buddha images, many carved. Secular carving
is also popular and can include carvings of monkeys, elephants or other natural
forms. There is a parallel history of Animism with a belief that guardian
spirits inhabit rivers, canals, trees and other natural features, which
pre-dates the arrival of all other religions and still plays a role in the
everyday life of most residents, with spirit shrines in abundance throughout the
country.  
 
 
Studying with Native carver Tommy
Joseph in Alaska inspired me, and now I want to build on that experience to
work with artists who have a different form of Native art, integral and
essential to their lives. I am fascinated to meet and study with Thai masters,
to expose myself to their ancient forms and incorporate them into my work in a
non-traditional environment: the urban jungle that is New York.  My goal is to continue my study with
artists who recognize the vital connection between the Source, the earth, what
we make with our hands, and our global connection to one-another. 
 
Now, via this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity offered from
British Airways, along with your contribution, I will be able to enhance my
proficiency and deepen the inherent spiritual connection of my artwork.  I look forward to my return and to
sharing with you what I learn.  


Will you help me to actualize my gifts so that they
can be a source of beauty, healing, and joy?


I plan to stay in the cheapest (safe)
accommodations, stay with my tour guides and other local families and in
backpacking hostels whenever possible. Still, I need money for transportation,
lodging, food, immunization shots, equipment  – plus money for materials and to donate to my teachers.
I’ve been advised that I should have approximately $3,000 for the trip, which, G-d willing, will take place February 3rd
– March 3rd 2011. 



I already have the plane reservations – but I can’t get
on the plane and go to Thailand without your help!  
 
My fundraising goals:
40 people donate $10 ($400)
35 donate $20 ($700)
25 donate $30 ($750)
15 donate $40 (600)
5 donate $50 ($250)
3 donate $100 ($300)
Total goal: $3,000
NOTE:  If I reach my goal, website administrators take 9% if I
don’t meet my goal, and 4% if I do.
 
If I don’t raise at least
$1,000 by February 1st – I won’t step foot on the plane! Of course you have ‘till March 2nd to make your
donations … but please don’t wait that long – do it right away!
 
Will you support me at the highest level that is
comfortable for you?
 
Any amount will help me reach my
goal.  
 
Safe and secure on-line donations can be made right on this site. 
 
MANY THANKS IN ADVANCE!

</h3>
</div><div> <p></p>According to well-known doodle advocate, Sunni Brown, ""We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus but in reality it is a preemptive measure to stop you from losing focus.""  Sunni believes that the real definition of doodling is ""to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think."" <br/><br/>In her TED talk <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fx0QcHyrFk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sunni Brown: Doodlers, unite! </a>, Sunni expounds on her admiration for doodling, saying ""under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or even the war room. On the contrary, doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations where information density is very high and the need for processing that information is very high."" She also says, ""Because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form, it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy.""<br/><br/>The act of doodling frees our minds from straining too hard for answers.
 It relaxes our thoughts, opening our minds to receive ideas or content 
from the our environment -- both locally and universally. Frequently, 
these ideas will provide answers to questions that we may have been 
struggling to solve. <br/><br/>It's time to stop the denigration of doodling and embrace it for the helpful tool and creative inspiration it is.

Our artists need help to cover the cost of this exhibition
Our bare minimum costs of $1,850 include:$600 Exhibition Fee $250  Postcard Fee$360  Food for Preview and Opening Reception$340  Brochure$300  Materials for workshopsA budget expanded by $2,200 would help fund:$300  Logo Design Fee$600  Misc. display costs (lights, Frames, Hardware, Magnets)$480  Shipping w/insurance for out-of-town art to get to gallery$480  Travel costs for out-of-town artists$360  Lodging for out-of-town artistsAnything beyond the $4,050 listed above would go towards booking a 
speaker like Sunni Brown or other doodle experts, as available. If 
successful, this could become a regular event that could feature many
 other artists' work and the exhibition could travel throughout the 
United States, spreading the love for doodles everywhere.Support the Doodle Revolution!

 According to well-known doodle advocate, Sunni Brown, ""We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus but in reality it is a preemptive measure to stop you from losing focus.""  Sunni believes that the real definition of doodling is ""to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think."" In her TED talk Sunni Brown: Doodlers, unite! , Sunni expounds on her admiration for doodling, saying ""under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or even the war room. On the contrary, doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations where information density is very high and the need for processing that information is very high."" She also says, ""Because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form, it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy.""The act of doodling frees our minds from straining too hard for answers.
 It relaxes our thoughts, opening our minds to receive ideas or content 
from the our environment -- both locally and universally. Frequently, 
these ideas will provide answers to questions that we may have been 
struggling to solve. It's time to stop the denigration of doodling and embrace it for the helpful tool and creative inspiration it is.

<p>Also featured in the bundle will be a mini-documentary chronicling the lead-up to the con, as well as some footage of the actual con itself. The estimated release date for both the tutorials and the documentary is May 2015.</p>

<p><b><i>AN EPIC SPACE TO EXPLORE AND EXPRESS OUR ART</i></b></p>
<p>We're really excited about the location for this year's event. We chose New York because it's conveniently located right in between the west coast of the United States and Europe. We hope this aids in less expensive travel (overall) for many our our attendees.</p>
<p>For the space, we wanted an environment that would both reflect our culture and also complement the art. A hotel ballroom simply wouldn't cut it for us, so we searched and searched and found the perfect spot. It's a giant open loft in Brooklyn with white walls, wood floors, and lots of light.</p>

</span></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What's great about this location is that it's right below a subway station, making transportation to and from the event a breeze.

<h1>FUNDING GOALS //</h1>
<p><b>A LOOK AT WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL GO TOWARD</b></p>
<p><b>$8,000</b> – Covers the cost of renting the Gowanus Loft for the weekend (including audio/visual gear to play sound and project videos), furniture, and event staff to ensure that everything runs smoothly.</p>
<p></p>
<div>
<b>$10,000</b> – Will also cover the cost of setting up our live stream technology to broadcast the video to all our online pass holders<i>.</i><p></p>
<p><b>$14,000</b> – Will allow us to provide accommodation for all our headliners<i>, which we would love to be able to do for them.</i></p>
<p><b>$16,000</b> – Gives us to ability to add another camera and broadcast two video feeds simultaneously,<i> giving anyone with an online pass the option to choose from multiple feeds for the best angle of what’s going on.</i></p>
</div>
<p><b>$20,000 </b> – If we can raise this much, we will be able to contribute towards helping some of our organisers and headliners with travel expenses. Most of them have already agreed to come on their own dime, but as airfare can be pretty expensive, we want to help out our fellow cardists as much as we can.</p>
<p><b>As a not-for-profit organization, anything exceeding these goals will go towards making the event much more awesome, as well as contribute to the development and funding for the next Cardistry-Con.</b></p>
</div>
</div><p></p><h1><br/></h1><h1>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h1><p>With four years of experience organizing a much larger conference, Magic-Con, we're very familiar with the risks and challenges of producing an event like Cardistry-Con. And although Cardistry-Con is a much smaller conference, we have not taken this for granted and are dedicating just as much attention and resources towards organizing it.</p><p>If this campaign is not successful, meaning we do not reach our funding goal by the deadline, Cardistry-Con 2015 will still happen. It is important for us that you understand that. However, with your support, we know it will be above and beyond what we can do on our own.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1><p></p><p><b>Will Cardistry-Con still happen if this project doesn’t get fully funded?</b></p><p></p><ul><li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Regardless of whether this Kickstarter project reaches its funding goals, Cardistry-Con 2015 will still be happening at the same date and times at the Gowanus Loft in Brooklyn. However, as the actual experience of the conference itself is directly correlated to the amount of contributions this campaign receives, we would love as much of your help as we can get so that we can make this year’s Cardistry-Con an unforgettable event for everyone involved.</span><br/>
</li></ul><div>
<p><b>I’ve signed up for Live Streaming but might not be able to watch the event live — will I still be able to watch the event footage at a later date?</b></p>
<ul><li>Yes. You can stream the event footage for viewing at a later date, and we will also be making the conference footage available for download for Online Pass holders eventually.</li></ul>
</div><p><b>I'd like to upgrade my perk! How do I do this?</b></p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Say you originally got the Premium Tutorials perk, but you would like to upgrade it to the Livestream + Premium Tutorials Bundle. Since the difference between the two is $20, simply enter $20 (or more) into the entry form on the right-hand side of the page, then click 'Contribute Now' to send in the amount. Once you've done so, simply forward us the e-mail from IndieGoGo to us at cardistrycon@gmail.com, and we will take note of the upgrade for you. </span>

<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If you're upgrading from the Live Streaming perk to the Livestream + Premium Tutorials Bundle, just repeat the steps above, but with $10 or more.</span><br/>

<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">There is no age limit for Cardistry-Con. That being said, if you are a minor and are traveling to New York with a parent, rest assured that since the event is taking place at a single location, your parent(s) can drop you off at the venue during conference hours (11am—7pm) and there will be plenty of adult supervision throughout the day.</span>

The Live Streaming pass is $30, and includes unlimited access to a high definition video stream of all three days' events. Watch it live as it's happening or stream it later.
And depending on how much funding we raise, we may be able to set up multiple cameras, giving the viewer a choice to switch between them.

In addition, anyone with an online pass will be able to engage with everyone attending the event in Brooklyn. There will be a comments stream below the video for you to ask questions, make requests, or have a discussion. These comments will be projected onto a wall at the event for everyone present to see and interact with.
This is a great opportunity for cardists not attending the event to be a part of the conference. And even if your schedule doesn't allow you to watch the event live, you’ll still be able to stream the broadcast any time.

PREMIUM TUTORIALS // $20
EXCLUSIVE TUTORIALS FROM OUR HEADLINERS
To make the most of this year's gathering, we'll be recording tutorials by the featured artists in our line-up. Each cardist will be contributing one of their original creations, and these tutorials will be compiled and made available as an on-demand digital download which you can pre-order as one of our pledge options.
Also featured in the bundle will be a mini-documentary chronicling the lead-up to the con, as well as some footage of the actual con itself. The estimated release date for both the tutorials and the documentary is May 2015.

THE VENUE // GOWANUS LOFT
AN EPIC SPACE TO EXPLORE AND EXPRESS OUR ART
We're really excited about the location for this year's event. We chose New York because it's conveniently located right in between the west coast of the United States and Europe. We hope this aids in less expensive travel (overall) for many our our attendees.
For the space, we wanted an environment that would both reflect our culture and also complement the art. A hotel ballroom simply wouldn't cut it for us, so we searched and searched and found the perfect spot. It's a giant open loft in Brooklyn with white walls, wood floors, and lots of light.


What's great about this location is that it's right below a subway station, making transportation to and from the event a breeze. It's in the Gowanus district with plenty of places to eat and hang out before and after each day's events.

 Since our event space is not a hotel, you're welcome to seek accommodation wherever you like. New York is full of options, and if you want to stay close by, we recommend rooming up with another attendee and seeking a place on Airbnb to stay.

ABOUT THE ORGANIZERS
To cater our event to the community as much as possible, we've been collaborating with some of the top minds (and hands) in cardistry to help organize this year's Cardistry-Con.

This year's organizing team includes Dan and Dave Buck (Dan & Dave), Zach Mueller (Fontaine Cards), Kevin Ho, Huron Low & Daren Yeow (The Virts), and Oliver Søgård & Tobias Levin (Dealers Grip).
FUNDING GOALS //
A LOOK AT WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL GO TOWARD
$8,000 – Covers the cost of renting the Gowanus Loft for the weekend (including audio/visual gear to play sound and project videos), furniture, and event staff to ensure that everything runs smoothly.


$10,000 – Will also cover the cost of setting up our live stream technology to broadcast the video to all our online pass holders.
$14,000 – Will allow us to provide accommodation for all our headliners, which we would love to be able to do for them.
$16,000 – Gives us to ability to add another camera and broadcast two video feeds simultaneously, giving anyone with an online pass the option to choose from multiple feeds for the best angle of what’s going on.

$20,000  – If we can raise this much, we will be able to contribute towards helping some of our organisers and headliners with travel expenses. Most of them have already agreed to come on their own dime, but as airfare can be pretty expensive, we want to help out our fellow cardists as much as we can.
As a not-for-profit organization, anything exceeding these goals will go towards making the event much more awesome, as well as contribute to the development and funding for the next Cardistry-Con.

RISKS AND CHALLENGESWith four years of experience organizing a much larger conference, Magic-Con, we're very familiar with the risks and challenges of producing an event like Cardistry-Con. And although Cardistry-Con is a much smaller conference, we have not taken this for granted and are dedicating just as much attention and resources towards organizing it.If this campaign is not successful, meaning we do not reach our funding goal by the deadline, Cardistry-Con 2015 will still happen. It is important for us that you understand that. However, with your support, we know it will be above and beyond what we can do on our own.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSWill Cardistry-Con still happen if this project doesn’t get fully funded?
Regardless of whether this Kickstarter project reaches its funding goals, Cardistry-Con 2015 will still be happening at the same date and times at the Gowanus Loft in Brooklyn. However, as the actual experience of the conference itself is directly correlated to the amount of contributions this campaign receives, we would love as much of your help as we can get so that we can make this year’s Cardistry-Con an unforgettable event for everyone involved.

I’ve signed up for Live Streaming but might not be able to watch the event live — will I still be able to watch the event footage at a later date?
Yes. You can stream the event footage for viewing at a later date, and we will also be making the conference footage available for download for Online Pass holders eventually.
I'd like to upgrade my perk! How do I do this?

Say you originally got the Premium Tutorials perk, but you would like to upgrade it to the Livestream + Premium Tutorials Bundle. Since the difference between the two is $20, simply enter $20 (or more) into the entry form on the right-hand side of the page, then click 'Contribute Now' to send in the amount. Once you've done so, simply forward us the e-mail from IndieGoGo to us at cardistrycon@gmail.com, and we will take note of the upgrade for you. 


If you're upgrading from the Live Streaming perk to the Livestream + Premium Tutorials Bundle, just repeat the steps above, but with $10 or more.

Is there an age limit for Cardistry-Con?
There is no age limit for Cardistry-Con. That being said, if you are a minor and are traveling to New York with a parent, rest assured that since the event is taking place at a single location, your parent(s) can drop you off at the venue during conference hours (11am—7pm) and there will be plenty of adult supervision throughout the day.

Event registrations are sold out, but I would still like to attend to the conference. What do I do now?

Unfortunately we are only able to offer 52 registration spots as the event venue size is limited. However, if you would like to be added to our waiting list in case any spots open up, then please contact us at cardistrycon@gmail.com with the subject title ‘Waiting List’ and we will keep you updated should places become available.",6.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Ce dernier tome se penche sur les 3 derniers lieux d'amarrage de l'abri mobile de DARE-DARE, soit le square Cabot, le parc Walter-Stewart et le Quartier des spectacles, et propose les réflexions de cinq auteurs sur diverses réalités des pratiques artistiques dans l'espace public : instrumentalisation, (in)visibilité, anti-spectacle.

<br/><p><b>AUTEUR.ES</b></p>
<p><b>Martin Dufrasne</b>, coordonnateur artistique à DARE-DARE, signe la préface et articule la réflexion qui sous-tend le projet Dis/location et, plus particulièrement, le fil conducteur qui a mené à cette publication.</p>
<br/><p><b>Alain Deneault</b> traite avec une ironie mordante des dérives du néolibéralisme, de la fascination de la société contemporaine pour l’économie et la rhétorique du management.</p>
<br/><p><b>Julie Châteauvert</b>, qui a été coordonnatrice des relations communautaires à DARE-DARE de 2007 à 2010, offre un témoignage vécu de l’intérieur, qui relate par flashes et décharges d’indignation les vives tensions qui ont caractérisé le séjour du Centre au square Cabot.</p>
<br/><p><b>Suzanne Paquet</b> aborde la question de l’invisibilité et du vide qui ont caractérisé le quatrième amarrage de DARE-DARE derrière l’usine de la JTI-MacDonald. Elle propose l’intéressante notion du point aveugle pour traduire cette zone et ce moment de transition.</p>
<br/><p><b>Edith Brunette</b> poursuit sa réflexion sur les formes de discours dominants et sur leur façon de représenter le monde en observant les politiques culturelles et leurs effets potentiellement insidieux sur les milieux de la création.</p>
<br/><p><b>Manon Tourigny</b> examine comment s’articulent les pratiques artistiques hors les murs des artistes sélectionnés par DARE-DARE alors qu’elle était commissaire, dans le cadre des éditions 2009, 2011 et 2013 du festival VIVA! art action.</p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>AUTHORS</b></p>
<p><b>Martin Dufrasne</b>, artistic coordinator for DARE-DARE, reflects in his preface on the philosophy that underpins the Dis/location project, and more specifically on the common thread that inspired this book.</p>
<br/><p><b>Alain Deneault</b>'s caustically ironic text criticizes neoliberalism and contemporary society’s fascination with the economy and with business rhetoric.</p>
<br/><p><b>Julie Châteauvert</b>, community relations coordinator for DARE-DARE between 2007 and 2010, delivers a first-person account via flashbacks and spurts of indignation on how tension ran high while the Centre was stationed in Cabot Square.</p>
<br/><p><b>Suzanne Paquet</b> addresses the notions of invisibility and vacuum that characterized DARE-DARE’s fourth stay behind the JTI MacDonald factory. She puts forth the interesting concept of “blind spot” to characterize this area and time of transition. </p>
<br/><p><b>Edith Brunette</b> pursues her reflection upon forms of dominant discourse and the manner in which they represent the world by addressing cultural policies and their potentially insidious effect on creative environments.</p>
<br/><p><b>Manon Tourigny</b>, curator for the 2009, 2011 and 2013 editions of the VIVA! art action festival, examines the workings of artistic practices outside the gallery by artists selected by DARE-DARE.</p>

<br/>***<br/><p>Through <i>Dis/location</i>, DARE-DARE has established a unique framework for the research and dissemination of art, with a mandate to promote site-specific interventions and actions—performance and installation works that infiltrate public space. This urban exploration is achieved through consecutive medium-term stops around the city of Montréal, in spaces that elicit rich social and political, polemical enquiries. For this initiative, DARE-DARE was awarded and Orange Medal (environmental &amp; urban planning) by Sauvons Montréal.<br/></p>

DARE-DARE est un centre d'artistes autogéré qui, en 2004, lançait Dis/location : projet d'articulation urbaine et installait ses bureaux dans un abri mobile pour produire des événements artistiques dans l'espace public.



3 DIS/LOCATIONs
Ce dernier tome se penche sur les 3 derniers lieux d'amarrage de l'abri mobile de DARE-DARE, soit le square Cabot, le parc Walter-Stewart et le Quartier des spectacles, et propose les réflexions de cinq auteurs sur diverses réalités des pratiques artistiques dans l'espace public : instrumentalisation, (in)visibilité, anti-spectacle. (en français)
AUTEUR.ES
Martin Dufrasne, coordonnateur artistique à DARE-DARE, signe la préface et articule la réflexion qui sous-tend le projet Dis/location et, plus particulièrement, le fil conducteur qui a mené à cette publication.
Alain Deneault traite avec une ironie mordante des dérives du néolibéralisme, de la fascination de la société contemporaine pour l’économie et la rhétorique du management.
Julie Châteauvert, qui a été coordonnatrice des relations communautaires à DARE-DARE de 2007 à 2010, offre un témoignage vécu de l’intérieur, qui relate par flashes et décharges d’indignation les vives tensions qui ont caractérisé le séjour du Centre au square Cabot.
Suzanne Paquet aborde la question de l’invisibilité et du vide qui ont caractérisé le quatrième amarrage de DARE-DARE derrière l’usine de la JTI-MacDonald. Elle propose l’intéressante notion du point aveugle pour traduire cette zone et ce moment de transition.
Edith Brunette poursuit sa réflexion sur les formes de discours dominants et sur leur façon de représenter le monde en observant les politiques culturelles et leurs effets potentiellement insidieux sur les milieux de la création.
Manon Tourigny examine comment s’articulent les pratiques artistiques hors les murs des artistes sélectionnés par DARE-DARE alors qu’elle était commissaire, dans le cadre des éditions 2009, 2011 et 2013 du festival VIVA! art action.

Unique trace tangible du passage de DARE-DARE sur chacun des sites investis, les publications approfondissent, appuient et assurent la pérennité de ses activités de recherche, de création et de diffusion artistique. Théoriciens, artistes et membres de DARE-DARE font part de leurs réflexions sur les infiltrations d’un organisme d’art actuel dans une structure telle que la Ville de Montréal, ainsi que des échos des pratiques spatiales dans des contextes urbains singuliers ailleurs dans le monde.

DIS/LOCATION 1 - Récipiendaire du Prix Grafika 2010
Le square Viger, lieu névralgique dans la géographie urbaine de Montréal, représente pour les auteurs de la publication – artistes, architectes, sociologues, journalistes – le point de départ d’une réflexion complexe sur les liens entre l’art et l’espace public envisagés dans leur dimension matérielle et symbolique. [En

Sous la thématique « de la faillibilité et de l’échec », les expériences vécues au parc sans nom (terrain vague sous le viaduc Rosemont-Van Horne) et les projets mis de l'avant par DARE-DARE sont revisités, faisant valoir l'approche « en laboratoire » du centre d'artistes. [Français

Avec Dis/location, DARE-DARE a établi un cadre de recherche et de diffusion artistique unique, dont le mandat est de promouvoir les interventions prenant place dans l'environnement urbain, par le biais d'œuvres performatives et installatives qui infiltrent l'espace public. Cette exploration urbaine s'effectue par amarrages successifs en des lieux de la ville de Montréal qui sont porteurs de riches questions sociales et politiques. Grâce à cette initiative, DARE-DARE s’est vu récompenser du Prix Orange (aménagement – urbanisme) par l'organisme Sauvons Montréal.


Lancement le 12 septembre 2015 sur le nouveau site de DARE-DARE, situé dans le triangle formé par les avenues Atwater, Greene et la rue Doré, à Montréal.

Official receipts provided for cash donations of $50 and above (purchases excluded).

***
An artist-run centre, DARE-DARE initiated in 2004 Dis/location : projet d'articulation urbaine and moved its offices in a mobile unit to present artistic interventions in the public space.

3 DIS/LOCATIONs (Translated from French by Nils Lövgren)
This new volume looks back on the 3 last locations of DARE-DARE’s mobile unit: Cabot Square, Walter-Stewart Park and the Quartier des spectacles. Five authors address various realities of artistic practices in public space, including instrumentalization, (in)visibility and the anti-spectacle. (in English)

AUTHORS
Martin Dufrasne, artistic coordinator for DARE-DARE, reflects in his preface on the philosophy that underpins the Dis/location project, and more specifically on the common thread that inspired this book.
Alain Deneault's caustically ironic text criticizes neoliberalism and contemporary society’s fascination with the economy and with business rhetoric.
Julie Châteauvert, community relations coordinator for DARE-DARE between 2007 and 2010, delivers a first-person account via flashbacks and spurts of indignation on how tension ran high while the Centre was stationed in Cabot Square.
Suzanne Paquet addresses the notions of invisibility and vacuum that characterized DARE-DARE’s fourth stay behind the JTI MacDonald factory. She puts forth the interesting concept of “blind spot” to characterize this area and time of transition. 
Edith Brunette pursues her reflection upon forms of dominant discourse and the manner in which they represent the world by addressing cultural policies and their potentially insidious effect on creative environments.
Manon Tourigny, curator for the 2009, 2011 and 2013 editions of the VIVA! art action festival, examines the workings of artistic practices outside the gallery by artists selected by DARE-DARE.

***Sole physical keepsakes of DARE-DARE's run at each location, these books ensure the furtherance and perpetuity of its activities in research, creation and dissemination of art. Thinkers, artists and DARE-DARE members share their thoughts on a current-art centre’s infiltrations into a structure such as the city of Montréal, and report on spatial practices in unusual urban settings elsewhere in the world.
DIS/LOCATION 1 - Recipient of a Grafika Prize [2010]
The Viger Square, a sensitive spot in Montréal’s urban geography. For the authors of book 1 [artists, architects, sociologists, journalists], it was the starting point of a complex reflection on the connection between art and public space as they appear in their material and symbolic dimensions. [In

DIS/LOCATION 2
The theme “Of Fallibility and Failure” guided this reexamination of DARE-DARE’s experience and the projects presented at the park with no name (a piece of raw land under the Rosemont-Van Horne viaduct), highlighting the laboratory approach of the Centre. [French and English. Authors :

***Through Dis/location, DARE-DARE has established a unique framework for the research and dissemination of art, with a mandate to promote site-specific interventions and actions—performance and installation works that infiltrate public space. This urban exploration is achieved through consecutive medium-term stops around the city of Montréal, in spaces that elicit rich social and political, polemical enquiries. For this initiative, DARE-DARE was awarded and Orange Medal (environmental & urban planning) by Sauvons Montréal.

<p><strong>An Evolving Rainbow Project</strong></p>
<p>Richart expresses; ""To get any campaign going, you first have to get into action. Then everything starts coming together. Since I started this campaign to build a Rainbow Home, so many people have come to me wishing to be part of the project. Many people wish to support by offering their energy, time and use their skills and talents to make this dream come true! And so we now wish to build a Rainbow Community with Rainbow Homes.""</p>
<p><strong>Clear Vision</strong></p>
<p>In October 2012, Richart had very clear and vivid detailed channelled visions of the Rainbow Homes and is now in the process of visualizing these 'dreams' so that they can be manifested into our co-creative shared reality on planet Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Building Rainbow Homes</strong></p>
<p>A Rainbow Home, is a way of life.  It is a consciousness that is spiritually fulfilling, socially just and environmentally sustainable. </p>
<p><strong>Why live in nature? </strong></p>
<p>In nature, we reconnect with the Universe, heal our energy faster and are naturally more open to other people. With a greater awareness of nature, we also become more conscious-minded about being responsible for this planet and our healing and happiness on it.  </p>
<p><strong>Universally Co-Creating</strong></p>
<p>The first Rainbow Home is going to be a showcase of what is possible when like-minded and open-hearted people work together on a global project. The final home will be powered by solar, wind and water energy. It will be made out of natural materials providing a safe, secure and comfortable place to rest and live.</p>
<p>Richart will be living in the Rainbow Home and be sharing his energy painting experience with you and basically being available to talk through ideas (online and face-to-face) about how to start building the Rainbow Community Homes. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Wish For &amp; What You Receive</h3>
<p>The funds raised from this project will go towards purchasing the materials and renting the land to build the first Rainbow Home on the magical island of Ibiza in 2013. </p>
<p>The cost of building and materials, plus taxes, insurance and delivery cost is USA Dollars 11,000. The price will also include 24/7, 365 days connection to the internet - Euro 56 per year. Plus Skype internal calling to landlines Euro 60 per year</p>
<p>Honestly, we have no idea how much this project will cost, but we certainly appreciate any funds that you wish to give us in support of building this new shared reality. </p>
<p>In exchange for your valuable donations, you receive special perks only availble through this fund-raiser campaign, such a Guide for Living in a 5D Reality, or a personal hand-written 'Thank You' letter from Richart or get the opportunity to visit him at the Rainbow Home and learn more about the Rainbow Community and experience to joy of being touched by art. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By donating funds, You are giving more people the opportunity to experience the channelled visions of Richart and to live the eco-love-consciousness' dream in reality.</p>
<p>You also support in co-creating a permenant place where you can meet Richart and experience the blissful transformative experience of being touched by art. You are also ensuring that he has a secure and safe home, where he can interconnect with us all year either online, in-person or through meditative telepathy, supporting us in our spiritual awakening.</p>
<p>Because Richart is so appreciative of receiving financial support, any donation always brings in and enables so many more magical things to manifest in his life and all those in his environment. So your donation has a very powerful and positive effect immediately. </p>
<p><em>People who receive his art therapy tend to laugh more! </em></p>
<p><strong>""Summer of Love"" Film</strong></p>
<p>In November 2012, the 'Summer of Love' movie trailer will be released to the world. This is a documentary, come movie, about the life and works of Richart and other like-minded heart people on the island of Ibiza. People who believe in the evolution of mankind for the betterment of humanity. So get ready, 2012 is just starting! </p>
<p>And as Ghandi said, ""Be the change, you want to see."" </p>

<h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
<p>In 1978, the <em>Song of Unity</em> mural was painted in the facade of our Berkeley building by a group of inimitable artists as the <a href=""http://www.lapena.org/index.php?s=4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">first 3D-collectively-painted mural in the Bay Area</a>.  After years of exposure to the sun and weather, the original mural is in an unrepairable state. As a nonprofit organization, still committed to our mission of promoting peace, social justice and cultural understanding through the arts, education and community action, we have decided to invest in the future of <a href=""http://lapena.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">La Peña</a> by building a new mural with a new generation of politically conscious artists.</p>
<p>We have now a great opportunity to bring into the fold a new generation of leaders in their field. <a href=""http://tys.mvmt.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Trust Your Struggle (TYS)</a> is an artist collective of visual artists, educators, and cultural workers dedicated to social justice and community activism through the medium of art. They have produced gallery installations, live paintings, murals and arts education workshops with youth and community organizations since 2003.  Some of the TYS muralists have been students of the original artists!</p>
<p>We need to raise <strong>$17,000 by July 1st </strong>so we can take down the old mural, purchase the materials, resurface the wall and pay artist fees and other related costs. Using new weatherproof and lighter materials and new special paints (Politech), Trust Your Struggle will create a 21st century mural that represents the concept that arts and culture can help cultivate social and political awareness and activism.</p>
<p>As for the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xJNwhC9Qmg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""La Cancion de la Unidad: quien es quien en el mural."">original mural</a>, it will be carefully dismantled and we are already exploring ideas for how it can be relocated to an interior space, preserving it as an historical East Bay landmark for future generations. We envision a day when you can visit La Peña and experience the transformation of our communities over a span of almost 40 years through the stories told within these two murals.   The murals are the different skins of our organization and they change as we change.</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>Murals have the power to change communities:  once people see that they can change their visual environment, they see possibilities to change other things in their lives as well.  In this way, the legacy of La Peña, as a home and a hub for cultural activism continues with each new generation. Our new mural represents only one of the many recent changes.  Visit us online at <a href=""http:/www/lapena.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">La Peña</a> to see what other changes we have undertaken (like renewing our lounge!).</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>We need to raise $17,000 for this to happen. The actual cost of removing and creating of a new mural is much higher, but we have matching seed funding from the Fleishhacker Foundation and the East Bay Fund for Artists.  These seed funds require that we raise matching dollars from many individuals like you. As a result, every dollar you give here is doubled in value!    We need to reach our funding goal by <strong>July 1st</strong>  so we can keep these seed funds and start working.   See the details of our budget in the PDF.</p>

<h2><strong>UPDATE:<br class=""Apple-interchange-newline""/></strong></h2>
<p><strong> The RAW art show was a success!   <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ALL MONEY</span> donated to Indiegogo is now going to ""Art with Heart.""  </strong></p>
<p><strong>If we meet the $600 before our fundraiser deadline, I'll increase the goal.  Let's see how much we can give to this great organization!</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<hr/>
<span style=""color: #444444;"">UPDATE #1:  <span>✔  </span>The ticket requirements of the art show have been met. Anyone seeking to support me (the artist) are still welcome to buy tickets, but donations for Art with Heart are preferrable.  Please make donations here.</span><hr/>
<h2><strong>FOR ME AND FOR THEM</strong></h2>
<p>For the first time since graduating, I have the opportunity to do an art show with my photography.  My photography and film are what keep me going every day, so having an opportunity to share it is exciting...but expensive.<br/><br/>I will be showing at the RAW |Ensemble art show on Saturday, September 8th, at the Trinity Nightclub in Seattle, but I need help to cover the costs of the show.  Tickets are $11 in advance and $15 at the door.  There will be prints of my work at my booth.  Beyond that, I hope to raise money for Art with Heart, a group which provides resources for art therapy for kids with special health and emotional needs.</p>
<p><strong>As much as I am excited to let the world see my work-- (well, Seattle, mostly)- I'd like to make it a valuable experience for more than just me.  Enter ""<a href=""http://www.artwithheart.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Art With Heart</a>.""   They are an organization based here in Seattle, Washington that provide supplies and programs to high-risk children.</strong></p>
<p>So any profit I make off this show, I want to give to them.  This is a group I could have benefited greatly from as a youth, so I want to help them endure now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://artwithheart.org/wp-content/themes/blueleaves/images/logo_banner.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>FROM THEIR WEBSITE:</strong></h3>
<p>""<strong>Art with Heart helps kids through the healing power of creativity.</strong></p>
<p>We do that through the creation and distribution of our <strong>therapeutic books </strong>and supportive <strong>trainings</strong> for caregivers to help children dealing with the stress and strain of hardship.</p>
<p>Our books combine engaging art with therapies that help youth cope with overwhelming feelings even in the midst of a crisis.<strong> In this way, Art with Heart supports their emotional and social growth, paving the way for success in school and in life.</strong></p>
<h3> </h3>

<br/><h3>WHAT I NEED - MET <span>✔</span>
</h3>
<p>I need to cover the costs of the show which is $600.  If we reach that, any additional money from tickets and prints will go to ""Art With Heart,"" AND I can extend the goal to collect more money for ""Art with Heart.""</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>SHOW: - COMPLETE ✔</h3>
<p>When: September 8th at 8pm to 10:30pm<br/>Where:  Trinity Nightclub at 111 Yessler Way, Pioneer Square, Seattle, WA<br/>Why:  To introduce artists of the Seattle area<br/><br/>Tickets are $11 in advance, $15 at the door.  Available here: <a href=""http://www.rawartists.org/seattle/ensemble/?artist=71908"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.rawartists.org/seattle/ensemble/?artist=71908</a></p>
<p>Any people outside of the Seattle area who cannot attend but would like to help can purchase tickets as a donation as well.  The cost of 20 tickets covers my booth fee, so any tickets over that go into the donation pool.  </p>

<p>“Carissa Starr can weave an entire tale in a single still frame, bringing a cinematic eye and a gift for storytelling together in art that is at once dark, intense, whimsical and playful.  She captures images which both provoke the viewer and invite them to bring something of themselves to the slice of the story they see.  From portraiture to fantasy, from photojournalism to nothing less than visual poetry, her work challenges and inspires the viewer in ways they will remember long after leaving the gallery.” - <em>Josef Stremick, American author and musician</em></p>

</div></div>","UPDATE:
 The RAW art show was a success!   ALL MONEY donated to Indiegogo is now going to ""Art with Heart.""  
If we meet the $600 before our fundraiser deadline, I'll increase the goal.  Let's see how much we can give to this great organization!
 

UPDATE #1:  ✔  The ticket requirements of the art show have been met. Anyone seeking to support me (the artist) are still welcome to buy tickets, but donations for Art with Heart are preferrable.  Please make donations here.
FOR ME AND FOR THEM
For the first time since graduating, I have the opportunity to do an art show with my photography.  My photography and film are what keep me going every day, so having an opportunity to share it is exciting...but expensive.I will be showing at the RAW |Ensemble art show on Saturday, September 8th, at the Trinity Nightclub in Seattle, but I need help to cover the costs of the show.  Tickets are $11 in advance and $15 at the door.  There will be prints of my work at my booth.  Beyond that, I hope to raise money for Art with Heart, a group which provides resources for art therapy for kids with special health and emotional needs.
As much as I am excited to let the world see my work-- (well, Seattle, mostly)- I'd like to make it a valuable experience for more than just me.  Enter ""Art With Heart.""   They are an organization based here in Seattle, Washington that provide supplies and programs to high-risk children.
So any profit I make off this show, I want to give to them.  This is a group I could have benefited greatly from as a youth, so I want to help them endure now.
 

FROM THEIR WEBSITE:
""Art with Heart helps kids through the healing power of creativity.
We do that through the creation and distribution of our therapeutic books and supportive trainings for caregivers to help children dealing with the stress and strain of hardship.
Our books combine engaging art with therapies that help youth cope with overwhelming feelings even in the midst of a crisis. In this way, Art with Heart supports their emotional and social growth, paving the way for success in school and in life.
 

WHAT I NEED - MET ✔

I need to cover the costs of the show which is $600.  If we reach that, any additional money from tickets and prints will go to ""Art With Heart,"" AND I can extend the goal to collect more money for ""Art with Heart.""
 
SHOW: - COMPLETE ✔
When: September 8th at 8pm to 10:30pmWhere:  Trinity Nightclub at 111 Yessler Way, Pioneer Square, Seattle, WAWhy:  To introduce artists of the Seattle areaTickets are $11 in advance, $15 at the door.  Available here: http://www.rawartists.org/seattle/ensemble/?artist=71908
Any people outside of the Seattle area who cannot attend but would like to help can purchase tickets as a donation as well.  The cost of 20 tickets covers my booth fee, so any tickets over that go into the donation pool.  
As of August 27th the minimum ticket requirement is met! 
 

 
WHAT YOU GET!
You are not only going to be helping to support an independent artist so I can reach out and network to a larger group of people that can help me further my art...BUT, you are contributing to an organization that helps kids with special needs...the sort of special needs often overlooked...the needs of the heart and the mind.
Obviously, the more you can give the more you are helping the kids who benefit from the programs at ""Art with Heart"" and you'll get a thank you gift too.
 


THE IMPACT
Any tickets sold after the required minimum of 20 (twenty), purchased by people who cannot attend, plus profits from print sales will be donated to ""Art With Heart.""  (Their information is here: artwithheart.org)

Community engagement. Bridging cultural divides. Economic development. Beautiful art. These are the goals of Midway Murals, an exciting new project made possible late last year when Jonathan Oppenheimer, the project leader, was selected as one of the winners of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation's Knight Arts Challenge Saint Paul. 





Our vision is to bring four remarkably talented public artists together with immigrant business owners and Hamline Midway neighborhood residents, gather their stories through community conversations, and then change the face of St. Paul through four incredible murals along Snelling Avenue.






Keep the contributions coming!





Midway Murals was awarded a $25,000 matching grant from the Knight Foundation, meaning we had to raise matching dollars to receive the full grant. We did it on April 1 with more than 50 hours to spare! But please keep the donations coming. This campaign was to match the grant, but we still have over $20,000 left to raise to complete the project, and your donations are still tax-deductible. Reaching this goal has set us on strong footing to raise the remaining funds – from individuals, foundations, businesses, and corporations – for the fourth and final mural.


Nearly all of the money we are raising will be used to buy high quality materials and to pay our artists the wages they deserve for the hundreds of hours required to produce murals of this scale.


The Artists

The theme of the murals is ""starting anew,"" and the muralists -- Lori Greene, Yuya Negishi, Greta McLain, and Eric Mattheis -- will craft their designs by hearing from local residents and immigrant business owners and asking them the same guiding questions: 


Where are you from and what do you call home? 
Where are you going and what are your hopes and dreams for the future? 
How do you describe your culture, identity and community?



Each artist brings a different approach, aesthetic, and background to the project, but each is committed to the same goal of engaging with the community to make it stronger, more deeply connected, and more firmly rooted in the great city of Saint Paul and the wonderful Hamline Midway neighborhood.




Other Ways You Can Help

Moi c'est Caroline. Je dessine. Beaucoup. 
Je dessine depuis que je suis toute petite. Partout où je vais, je traîne mon cahier, ma plume et mes couleurs. Je dessine des gens, amis ou inconnus, dans des lieux publics. Vous pouvez voir des exemples de mes dessins sur ce blogue et sur Instagram.
Je suis maintenant prête à passer aux choses sérieuses. 




Le projet: illustrer un livre à Istanbul

Tassia écrit. Beaucoup. Elle est l'auteure des oeuvres semi-autobiographiques Judas (Éd. Leméac, 2007, 142 p.) et Mère-Grand (Éd. Leméac, 2010, 134 p.; finaliste prix du Gouverneur général 2010). Elle est Montréalaise, mais habite depuis deux ans à Istanbul, où elle travaille à son troisième roman et vit avec l'homme qui est devenu son mari. Tassia et moi on s'était rencontrées il y a 6 ans chez des amis. On est devenues amies Facebook, et, petit à petit, admiratrices mutuelles. Moi de ses histoires, elle de mes dessins. On s'est dit, en riant, que je pourrais illustrer ses histoires. Et puis on a arrêté de rire et on s'est dit qu'en fait c'était une bonne idée pour vrai. On s'est même découvert une adoration commune pour les carnets de voyage de Joann Sfar. Les étoiles étaient alignées.
Tassia avait finalement trouvé son illustratrice pour le projet de livre qu'elle dorlotait depuis longtemps:
Un livre illustré, qui, inspiré de sa propre expérience d'écrivaine explorant la vie quotidienne de ses personnages, aurait pour arrière-plan sa nouvelle ville adorée: Istanbul. 
Le plan: grâce à votre soutien, je pars à Istanbul pour un mois, en novembre. Tassia me montre son Istanbul. On se promène, on observe. Elle écrit, je dessine.
Puis on met tout ça ensemble et on présente le projet à des éditeurs. 






Où ira votre argent et ce que je vous offre en échange 
En gros, ça coûte des sous se concentrer sur un projet de dessin pendant un mois. En commandant un dessin (voir options à droite), vous m'aiderez à mettre toutes mes énergies sur ce projet magnifique. Et vous contribuerez un peu aussi à me mettre de la pression pour faire les plus beaux dessins que je puisse faire.
Peu importe ce que vous choisirez, votre nom apparaîtra dans les remerciements du livre, et vous serez bien sûr invité(e) au lancement. 



Soutenir le projet en partageant
Pas d'argent? Pas de problème. Faites rouler les outils de partage que vous trouverez sous la vidéo : 
Partagez sur Facebook. Partagez sur Twitter. Parlez-en à vos amis et à votre famille.  
Ça peut sembler anodin, mais ça compte pour beaucoup : plus le projet gagnera en intérêt, plus il nous sera facile de convaincre les meilleures maisons d'édition que notre livre se mérite un espace de choix dans votre bibliothèque.  
-
Merci infiniment de votre soutien. Vraiment. C'est un projet qui me tient beaucoup à coeur et je suis heureuse que vous y participiez. J'ai hâte de vous inviter au lancement.

*ENGLISH*


Hi! I'm Caroline. I draw. A lot. 


Drawing is something I've always done. Everywhere I go, I take my sketchbook, my pen and my watercolour kit. I draw people, friends or strangers, usually in public places.


You can see examples of my work on this blog and on Instagram.
Now it's time to take it to the next level. 

The perfect opportunity: Illustrate a book about Istanbul

Tassia writes. A lot. She has published two semi-autobiographical works of fiction (Judas, Éd. Leméac, 2007, 142 p.; Mère-Grand, Éd. Leméac, 2010, 134 p. -- Governor General Award Finalist) and is now working on her third novel in Istanbul, living with the man who has become her husband. 
We met six years ago at a party (she's from Montreal). We became Facebook friends, and, little by little, mutual fans. She of my drawings, I of her stories. We got joking about me illustrating them.

The basic concept: thanks to your support, I get to Istanbul in November, and stay there for a month. Tassia writes, I draw.  
Then we present our book project to editors, and get it published. 
This is my chance to step up my game, and you can help me make it happen. 



What I need money for and what you get in exchange
In a nutshell, leaving for a month to concentrate on a drawing project requires a bit of resources. By ordering a drawing (see options on the right), you will be helping me focus all of my energies on making sure I am doing the absolute best I can. Hello, peer-pressure.  
And whatever you contribute, your name will appear on the special thanks of the book, and you will definitely be invited to the book launch.

<h3>Van Art Project </h3>
<div>In 2012, The First Annual Van Art Project was designed to respond to the psychological needs of the local women and children after an earthquake hit the area hard. Working in close partnership with a local women's organization, VAKAD (Van Woman's Association), the Van Art Project offered daily directive based groups that focused on therapeutic art making and psycho-education throughout the week of July 2-6, 2012. </div>
<div>Although the earthquake’s life altering consequences were evident in the area, another ongoing issue quickly surfaced during the Van Art Project: interfamilial and domestic violence. It appeared that the prior trauma prominent in the area resurfaced and became more apparent with the subsequent trauma of the earthquake. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In July 2013, The Van Art Project is returning to Van and aims to promote resiliency, provide the participating women and children with sense of safety, self-efficacy, containment and stabilization to help them cope with their everyday lives. 
<div> </div>
<div>In light of the incidents taking place in Turkey right now the importance of our project as Van Art Project Team become much more evident:</div>

<strong>We are going (back) to Van, Turkey to plant the seeds for raising a generation that will have an alternative language to violence.</strong>  CONTRIBUTE TO OUR PROJECT IN ANY WAY YOU CAN AND PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE CHANGE ! </div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; Where Your Contriburions Are Going:</h3>
<p>The Van Art Project is a volunteer based project and is made possible through generous donations of many individuals and organizations. </p>
<p>While we are most grateful for any and all donations that we receive, there are still several expenses that must be covered. With the great work that we are doing in Van also comes a huge task: To raise enough money to make the 2<sup>nd</sup> annual Van Art Project Workshop even more successful and sustainable than last year!</p>
<p>Times are difficult for all of us right now, especially the people of Van who are still recovering. If there is any amount of money you could donate to help this worthy cause, the Van Art Project and the people of Van would be extremely appreciative.</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise a grand total of $ 20,000 for the project some of these expeses are thankfully covered by our amazing donors such as Turkish Philanthropy Funds, we are hoping to get $5,000 through Indiegogo donations. Please note that donations are tax deductible thanks to our fiscal sponsor, Sanat Psikoterapileri Derneği (Art Psychotherapy Foundation). As you may know fiscalsponsorship does not provide us with funds, it only provides us with the means to receive the funds with a public interest and tax exemption status. The tax number for Sanat Psikoterapileri Derneği is 7430417432. Their website is <a href=""http://www.sanatpsikoterapileridernegi.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sanatpsikoterapileridernegi.org</a></p>
<p>This is the small list of essential expenses that we are hoping to raise donations for:</p>
<p>Airfare to Van, Turkey for our team of Art Therapists and Psychologists: $ 5,000</p>
<p>Art supplies for the children and women of Van, including but not limited to markers, oil pastels, crayons, scissors, paper, glue, canvas bags, fabric markers, fabric, yarn : $ 2,500</p>
<p>Housing and Food for Van Art Project Team: $3,000</p>
<p><br/> Again, we realize that you may not be in the position to donate to this cause. If that’s the case, words of encouragement will go a long way and are much appreciated! Also please don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools and spread the word...</p>
<p>However, if you are able to donate even just $5, every little bit will help! (But it’s ok for you to donate more than $5, too!)</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise this money by June 24, as the Van Art Project team will be flying to Van, Turkey in early July, 2013. </p>

What We Need & Where Your Contriburions Are Going:
The Van Art Project is a volunteer based project and is made possible through generous donations of many individuals and organizations. 
While we are most grateful for any and all donations that we receive, there are still several expenses that must be covered. With the great work that we are doing in Van also comes a huge task: To raise enough money to make the 2nd annual Van Art Project Workshop even more successful and sustainable than last year!
Times are difficult for all of us right now, especially the people of Van who are still recovering. If there is any amount of money you could donate to help this worthy cause, the Van Art Project and the people of Van would be extremely appreciative.
We are hoping to raise a grand total of $ 20,000 for the project some of these expeses are thankfully covered by our amazing donors such as Turkish Philanthropy Funds, we are hoping to get $5,000 through Indiegogo donations. Please note that donations are tax deductible thanks to our fiscal sponsor, Sanat Psikoterapileri Derneği (Art Psychotherapy Foundation). As you may know fiscalsponsorship does not provide us with funds, it only provides us with the means to receive the funds with a public interest and tax exemption status. The tax number for Sanat Psikoterapileri Derneği is 7430417432. Their website is http://www.sanatpsikoterapileridernegi.org
This is the small list of essential expenses that we are hoping to raise donations for:
Airfare to Van, Turkey for our team of Art Therapists and Psychologists: $ 5,000
Art supplies for the children and women of Van, including but not limited to markers, oil pastels, crayons, scissors, paper, glue, canvas bags, fabric markers, fabric, yarn : $ 2,500
Housing and Food for Van Art Project Team: $3,000
 Again, we realize that you may not be in the position to donate to this cause. If that’s the case, words of encouragement will go a long way and are much appreciated! Also please don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools and spread the word...
However, if you are able to donate even just $5, every little bit will help! (But it’s ok for you to donate more than $5, too!)
Our goal is to raise this money by June 24, as the Van Art Project team will be flying to Van, Turkey in early July, 2013.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

What is it like when the soul is slammed out of the body and is incompletely returned?
My name is Paulina Borsook, and I'm a writer living in Santa Cruz, California. In 1968, when I was fourteen years old, I was shot in the head with a Colt .45 from a distance of six feet.

Almost two million people in the United States experience traumatic brain injury (TBI) every year, but not much is said or written about what it feels like from the inside to live ever after with some of the consequences of TBI.

My Life as a Ghost is an art project about certain aspects of TBI, encompassing film, installation, literature, and performance. The project was born from my own experience with TBI, triggered by a handgun left cocked and loaded in a kitchen drawer.
A month-long research residency at Stanford University in the fall of 2013 will help lay a foundation for the project and will include a performance and workshop.

The goal of this campaign is to raise $5,000 for the phase of the project that comes afterwards.



About This Project
My own TBI was one of those medical miracles, the kind where the person should not have survived, much less remained able to walk and talk. A .45 slug is as big as a someone's thumb—and all the bullet did was fracture my jaw, blow out a portion of my skull, go through two walls, and lodge in a brick fireplace.

Pasadena, the artist's home, before the world was shattered




The medical science of the time didn't understand that TBI can have all kinds of subtle emotional and cognitive consequences. That I was still alive and apparently just like the person I was before was all that anyone could see.

But there were long-term consequences and impairments. The strangest and most illuminating after-effect—the one that most profoundly raises questions about what it means to be human and alive—is this: that ever after that gunshot wound, I was never entirely sure if I should be here, on this earth, in this life.


The scene of the crime

I had to figure out this most profound of alienations from my own life on my own. At the time, there was no medical or cultural guidance to be had. I discovered from the inside out that this alienation was a neurological artifact and not a character flaw.

This permanent uncertainty about being in the world and in one's own body is not unique to me. Other people with TBI also live with this ghostliness every day of their post-injury lives. Yet unlike many people with TBI, I still have powers of articulation. This project therefore feels like something I have been uniquely called to do.

My Life as a Ghost will capture and make manifest this state of not-really-being-here-but-here. It will pose questions about what is brain and what is mind and what is spirit.

<strong>CleverLand</strong><strong> with DustFish Burning Man 2018</strong>
</h2><p>CleverLand is a multidimensional mutant vehicle featuring four levels composed of nine performance stages, a four-story viewing platform, and state of the art special effects including sound engineering, LED light shows, fire effects, vibrational healings, ziplines, and more! Additionally, CleverLand will shift into a connection platform contributing a superabundance of actors, musicians, performing artist, motivational speakers, and further civic applications to be experienced. This project will be a vehicle in sharing open source art, applied sciences, alternative energies, building practices, innovative engineering, and manufacturing techniques to share how self-sustaining communities may thrive in a new world!</p><p> </p><h3>Building Process</h3><p><strong>Design</strong></p><p>The walls of the ship will consist of pop out panels for side seating and impromptu stages with a 3rd-floor electronic door opening system, an elevator platform, portal windows, overhead electric crane, and a rear porch deck. Once in place, the exterior will be finished with riveted armored cladding to embody a mutated vessel. The 1st-floor interior is a remodeled bus featuring lounge, wardrobe, shower. The 2nd-floor interior will feature stained-wood paneling draped in fabrics and upholstery to mimic the old time feel of a carriage or train car. The 3rd-floor interior will be glazed in a speckled polyurea to resemble the depth of a starfaux. Last but not least, the 4th-floor interior will be furnished as an illustrious penthouse with a viewing deck observatory fit for a cosmonaut of the highest caliber.</p><p><strong>Construction</strong></p><p>To create this innovation chamber, our team has fabricated modular galactic shield made up of steel frames, composite insulation, exterior metal cladding, and metal armoring. Autonomous functionality, electric winches, and wiring will be installed to each shield and then secured by stabilizer trussing and tensioning webbing.</p><p><strong>Lighting &amp; Sound</strong></p><p>CleverLand will be illuminated with 250 meters of LEDs throughout the interior and exterior of the bus serving as full body running lights. DMX lighting will be rigged onto the roof to provide light effects to the main stage and surrounding area to create a captivating environment.

CleverLand is a multidimensional mutant vehicle featuring four levels composed of nine performance stages, a four-story viewing platform, and state of the art special effects including sound engineering, LED light shows, fire effects, vibrational healings, ziplines, and more! Additionally, CleverLand will shift into a connection platform contributing a superabundance of actors, musicians, performing artist, motivational speakers, and further civic applications to be experienced. This project will be a vehicle in sharing open source art, applied sciences, alternative energies, building practices, innovative engineering, and manufacturing techniques to share how self-sustaining communities may thrive in a new world! Building ProcessDesignThe walls of the ship will consist of pop out panels for side seating and impromptu stages with a 3rd-floor electronic door opening system, an elevator platform, portal windows, overhead electric crane, and a rear porch deck. Once in place, the exterior will be finished with riveted armored cladding to embody a mutated vessel. The 1st-floor interior is a remodeled bus featuring lounge, wardrobe, shower. The 2nd-floor interior will feature stained-wood paneling draped in fabrics and upholstery to mimic the old time feel of a carriage or train car. The 3rd-floor interior will be glazed in a speckled polyurea to resemble the depth of a starfaux. Last but not least, the 4th-floor interior will be furnished as an illustrious penthouse with a viewing deck observatory fit for a cosmonaut of the highest caliber.ConstructionTo create this innovation chamber, our team has fabricated modular galactic shield made up of steel frames, composite insulation, exterior metal cladding, and metal armoring. Autonomous functionality, electric winches, and wiring will be installed to each shield and then secured by stabilizer trussing and tensioning webbing.Lighting & SoundCleverLand will be illuminated with 250 meters of LEDs throughout the interior and exterior of the bus serving as full body running lights. DMX lighting will be rigged onto the roof to provide light effects to the main stage and surrounding area to create a captivating environment. Dustfish will be providing a seven thousand watt pro-audio sound system with a variety of live, high vibrational sound guaranteed to titillate participant’s ears throughout Black Rock City. Inspiration and MessageThe CleverLand engineers aim to push the limits of applied science to transform old world ideas with mental & mechanical properties and modern compositions to accelerate the incubation of next-generation technologies which hold potential to change the world!

<h3>The Zelart Scholarship</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is James 'Grim' Desborough. I'm an author and roleplaying game designer from the UK, with my own small press publisher, Postmortem Studios. I run the Zelart Scholarship in memory of my friend and collaborator, 'Zel'.</p>
<p>Zel was an artist I worked with and helped through his education. We met through friends and formed a strong working relationship together. We made card games together and he provided illustrations for several of my gaming books. I got a great sense of satisfaction from helping a young, budding artist through school and watching his talent blossom.</p>
<p>Sadly, Zel was killed in an accident before I got to see him fully achieve his artistic potential or the success he so richly deserved.</p>
<p>Casting about for something I could do to commemorate him, I remembered how we had met, how the work I gave him had helped him so much and how good it had felt to nurture that talent. The best way to remember Zel, I felt, was to do the same for others.</p>
<p>In my day to day work I do what I can, deliberately seeking out young, marginalised, disabled, unemployed, homeless and other disadvantaged artists to give them a leg up, money and help in getting the attention of the RPG and publishing community to get them into more regular work.</p>
<p>The Zelart scholarship is a natural extension of this. A way to hunt out and promote new talent and to give them a lump sum of cash to smooth their way. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We sell Zel's back catalogue of stock art, along with donated artworks and the artwork of past winners to raise funds over the year and supplement that with what we can raise via this fundraiser. This isn't about selling a product to you, but what you get out of it is more, reasonably priced stock art, a way to nurture new artists and a warm sense of self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>Whatever money we get will go to the scholarship winner, if we raise a great deal over and above our target we may institute second or third tier awards. Whatever we raise will go to artists.</p>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div><p>It can be challenging to find people both to sponsor and to enter into this scholarship. Previous years this has proven very challenging. Whatever you can do to spread the word to potential sponsors, donators and entrants is greatly appreciated.</p></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Besides a contribution, you can help out in many other ways.</p>
<p>Are you a young artist or an artist suffering from reduced circumstances? Then enter!</p>
<p>Are an artist who is doing OK for themselves and has some spare personal pieces they don't mind being sold to support this enterprise? You can donate art!</p>

<p>As a preparatory sketch, Salisbury’s drawing was not really meant to last a very long time. It is therefore very unique to have a piece of artwork that is nearly 100-years-old accessible for all to see.</p>

<h2><b>More about Jack</b></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The 16-year-old boy hero John Travers Cornwell VC, known as Jack Cornwell or Boy Cornwell, was one of the youngest people to take part in the Battle of Jutland in 1916. He was also the youngest to receive the Victoria Cross, a medal awarded for ‘most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice’.</p>

<p>Standing alone in an exposed position on HMS Chester, with fatally-wounded crew members around him, Jack remained at his post until he received orders, despite steel splinters penetrating his chest shortly before he died.</p>

<p>Jack was one of the youngest people to join the Royal Navy. His heroism and demeanour have touched many hearts and after an initial common burial, his body was exhumed and he was publicly re-buried with full naval honours.</p>
<p>School children from around the nation each donated a penny of their pocket money to The Jack Cornwell Memorial Fund, which was established to finance a ward for disabled sailors, the Star and Garter Home, at Richmond. An impressive amount of £18,000 was raised, which, based on an historic inflation calculator, is equivalent to £1,653,224.45 today.</p>

<h2><b>More About The Drawing </b></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>To keep Jack's memory alive, in 1917, one of the great society artists of his time, Frank O. Salisbury (British, 1874-1962) painted a famous portrait of him called 'John Cornwell, V.C., on H.M.S. Chester’. </p>
<p>We are very privileged to have acquired the very first large preparatory charcoal and pastel sketch  of this painting. Unfortunately, the 271 x 151.5 cm drawing is in a very poor and fragile state and cannot currently be shown to the public.</p>
<p>The famous Frank O. Salisbury painting of Jack Cornwell  is located at the Naval Training Establishment HMS Raleigh in Plymouth.</p>

Our goal is to keep their memory alive and enable the generations of people to learn about them and be inspired by them.As part of our preparations for the Battle of Jutland centenary commemorations next year, we purchased a very unique large charcoal drawing of boy hero Jack Cornwell, who was only 16-years-old when he died fighting for his country in the battle.  Image: NMRN ArchivesBearing mortal wounds and awaiting orders, Jack remained at his post on his ship HMS Chester. He died shortly after the battle but his courage was recognised when he was awarded a Victoria Cross medal posthumously for honourable conduct. His story touched the hearts of the nation, which demanded that he be re-buried with full naval honours.   Image: Jack Cornwell-Funeral, Courtesy of Newham Heritage ServiceThe drawing of Jack by Frank O.Salisbury is a 271 x 151.5 cm large preparatory charcoal and pastel sketch which is in a very poor and fragile state and in need of serious conservation.We want Jack’s story to live on and to capture people’s hearts once more. Your contributions will help us to restore the drawing, which will form the centrepiece at the world’s largest Battle of Jutland exhibition in May 2016 at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard.If, like us, you feel it is important to remember young heroes like Jack and want to be involved in ensuring his story is not forgotten, and inspire future generations, then please support our campaign. Funding Goal and Perks  We need to raise £25,000 to cover the costs of the restoration, framing, transport and other campaign-related costs and fees.To show our appreciation for your support we have prepared a very unique set of perks which include:£5 -  A specially designed thank-you graphic with your name on our Twitter account @NatMuseumRN£10-  A thank you video from the crowdfunding team and published on our Facebook page.£25 - A ticket to the world's largest Battle of Jutland exhibition at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, opening May 2016£100 - A limited edition postcard featuring the Jack Cornwell charcoal and pastel sketch and a ticket to the world's  largest Battle of Jutland exhibition at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, opening May 2016£250 -  A replica of the Victoria Cross medal with the Naval Ribbon - the same style as Jack Cornwell was awarded, a ticket to the world's largest Battle of Jutland exhibition at the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, opening May 2016 and a limited edition postcard featuring the Jack Cornwell charcoal and pastel sketch.£500 - Your name on the Donor Wall in the world's largest Battle of Jutland exhibition at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, opening May 2016, a limited edition postcard featuring the Jack Cornwell charcoal and pastel sketch and a ticket to the Battle of Jutland exhibition.£1,000 - An invitation to the VIP launch of the Battle of Jutland exhibition in May 2016, a tour of the exhibition, 2 tickets to the exhibition and a limited edition postcard featuring the Jack Cornwell pastel and charcoal sketch, for two people.£1,500 - An invitation to the VIP launch of the Battle of Jutland exhibition in May 2016, a tour of the exhibition, your name on the Donor Wall, 2 tickets to the exhibition and a limited edition postcard featuring the Jack Cornwell pastel and charcoal sketch, for two people.  The Impact  You only need look at our first crowdfunding campaign to get an idea of just how big an impact they can have. We raised £9,236 to help preserve First World War ship HMS M.33, the only remaining Royal Navy survivor of the Gallipoli Campaign. The money raised was crucial in contributing to the opening of this unique attraction, which has already been visited by more than 42,000 people.Now, we want to make an even bigger impact with our Jack Cornwell campaign. Emotional and InspirationalJack’s story inspires people. It did in 1916 when the nation came together to demand his re-burial and when they raised money for a fund, established in his name, which in turn sponsored a ward for wounded and disabled sailors at the Star and Garter Home in Richmond.  Image: Courtesy of Grimsby Fishing Heritage CentreThe Scout Association has introduced a Jack Cornwell Badge which is awarded ‘in respect of pre-eminently high character and devotion to duty, together with great courage and endurance’.Those who train to be in the Royal Navy at the HMS Raleigh training establishment in Plymouth know all about Jack Cornwell. Raleigh has a New Entry Division named after Cornwell and VIPs are taken to view the painting of him after Passing Out Parades every year – Jack’s story and its importance is explained by the Captain. The picture hangs in the Church of England Church, on view for everyone to see.
 
Historical
Jack’s courage is part of a bigger historical story – the Battle of Jutland, the largest naval battle in the First World War. Our centenary commemorations will help to bring alive the stories of those who fought.
Artistic
As a preparatory sketch, Salisbury’s drawing was not really meant to last a very long time. It is therefore very unique to have a piece of artwork that is nearly 100-years-old accessible for all to see.
 
 
More about Jack
 
The 16-year-old boy hero John Travers Cornwell VC, known as Jack Cornwell or Boy Cornwell, was one of the youngest people to take part in the Battle of Jutland in 1916. He was also the youngest to receive the Victoria Cross, a medal awarded for ‘most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice’.

Standing alone in an exposed position on HMS Chester, with fatally-wounded crew members around him, Jack remained at his post until he received orders, despite steel splinters penetrating his chest shortly before he died.

Jack was one of the youngest people to join the Royal Navy. His heroism and demeanour have touched many hearts and after an initial common burial, his body was exhumed and he was publicly re-buried with full naval honours.
School children from around the nation each donated a penny of their pocket money to The Jack Cornwell Memorial Fund, which was established to finance a ward for disabled sailors, the Star and Garter Home, at Richmond. An impressive amount of £18,000 was raised, which, based on an historic inflation calculator, is equivalent to £1,653,224.45 today.

More About The Drawing 
 
To keep Jack's memory alive, in 1917, one of the great society artists of his time, Frank O. Salisbury (British, 1874-1962) painted a famous portrait of him called 'John Cornwell, V.C., on H.M.S. Chester’. 
We are very privileged to have acquired the very first large preparatory charcoal and pastel sketch  of this painting. Unfortunately, the 271 x 151.5 cm drawing is in a very poor and fragile state and cannot currently be shown to the public.
The famous Frank O. Salisbury painting of Jack Cornwell  is located at the Naval Training Establishment HMS Raleigh in Plymouth.

I’m the heart and art behind <a href=""http://peachseas.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peach Seas</a>.<br/>I’ve been passionate about creativity all my life.  As I grew, I traded in my sketchbooks for digital art and my beloved tablet. This creative drive and a healthy fondness for video games lead me to attend Full Sail University pursuing Computer Animation.  Degree in-hand I returned home with hopes of one day utilizing my artistic skill set as a profession.  However for all my budding knowledge fresh out of college, I still lacked enough personal confidence to enter the gaming industry.</p><p>Instead I found myself working a job in the shipping (and later marketing) department of a local online retailer.  I had experienced everything from order fulfillment to manufacturing in the three years I worked there which sparked a new personal aspiration… With the generous support of my mother, Julie, along with my personal savings I would launch my own brand as a platform to satisfy my creative needs and provide myself a sustainable income in the process.  I began simply with the brand’s name, landing on a phrase that combined two things I love - Peach (my favorite color) + Seas (representing my adoration of ocean life after growing up near the beaches and estuaries of Southwest Florida).  This trend of blending two themes became the blueprint for our Peach Seas boutiques and soon the <a href=""http://peachseas.com/DrellieGarden/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drellie Garden</a> was established!</p><p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530660712/tne2dj2t7zev2uictgjc.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>Drellies are dragons born with the appearance of their favorite food, sort of a fun nod to camouflage in the natural world.  These creatures are the merging of my love for dragons and interest in plant life, as they are modeled after fruit.  Since 2013 the Garden has steadily grown to include 24 Fruit Drellie characters featured in a range of products including my favorite, PLUSH!  <i>**Fun Fact, the term Drellie came from fusing the word Dragon with my name.</i><br/>Considering our limited capacity for funding and storage along with my desire for variety, I developed the following practical Plush Plan to bring each of these 24 Drellies to life :</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Drellie Jumbo Plush</strong><br/>I wanted these to be BIG and crazy huggable, therefore we could only produce a few due to limited space and costly production.  We chose the following 4 characters based on popularity to feature as Jumbos : <a href=""http://peachseas.com/DrellieGarden/Novelties/Plushies/DragonfruitDrellieJumboPlush/#slider-image-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dragonfruit</a>, <a href=""http://peachseas.com/DrellieGarden/Novelties/Plushies/AvocadoDrellieJumboPlush/#slider-image-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Avocado</a>, Watermelon, and Pineapple.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Drellie Belly Plush</strong><br/>These would be smaller, still cuddly, but more expressive; featuring an array of eye styles to convey emotion.  We chose the following 8 characters to feature as Bellies : <a href=""http://peachseas.com/DrellieGarden/Novelties/Plushies/CantaloupeDrellieBellyPlush/#slider-image-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cantaloupe</a>, <a href=""http://peachseas.com/DrellieGarden/Novelties/Plushies/CherryDrellieBellyPlush/#slider-image-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cherry</a>, <a

Pineberry.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Drellie Bite Plush</strong><br/>This miniature style would allow us to feasibly produce the remainder of our Fruit Drellie hoard.  And thus the final 12 characters were paired up according to their best buddies to be featured as Bites : Banana &amp; Blackberry, Orange &amp; Blueberry, Raspberry &amp; Kiwi, Lime &amp; Lemon, Red &amp; Green Apple, and White &amp; Purple Grape.</p><p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530661050/kafh3fgdbhjqi1ja8wej.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>Over the years we’ve done our best to save up and personally fund each new endeavor, plush or otherwise, for Peach Seas.  The downside to this method is the sluggish pace we must trudge to breathe life into new and exciting merchandise.  It can take well over a year to save up the kind of dough it takes to finance a project as expensive as plush manufacturing.  Although slow and steady progress coincides with our easy going approach to life and business we’ve begun to turn things up a notch, releasing 4 new plush this year alone!  This recent change of pace has been exhilarating and we’re eager to keep up the momentum.  This is where you come in!  We need your help to keep the ball rollin’ as we focus efforts on our next plush project, the Drellie Bites.</p><p><strong>“GIVE US THE DEETS ON THOSE PRECIOUS PLUSH!”</strong><br/>Our Drellie Bites are made of a super soft minky fabric filled with plastic pellets giving the plush a weighted and satisfying texture to fidget with in your fingers.  These little plush are approximately 3” long, 2” wide, 1.75” tall, and suspended from a 3” elastic chord.  The Egg Capsule (only available through the Drellie Bite Dozen perk) is made of plastic approximately 7” tall and 5” wide with a removable clear top and solid white bottom.  The Drellie Bites are wonderful accessories for your backpack, office desk, suitcase, ball-jointed doll, purse, fruit basket, mobile game-console case, and even your car rear-view mirror!  They would also make an impressive and unique stocking stuffer this holiday season ;)<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530711346/enx3naxrelnshazzxfha.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>“OK, I’M SOLD!  WHAT’S THE SKINNY ON THIS CAMPAIGN?”</strong><br/>As you may have noticed, we’ve finalized the prototypes for these plush.  Now all that’s left is to fund production.  As you may not know, we’ve already accumulated enough money on our own to fund half the Drellie Bites!  Our savings will fund the designs from Batch #1 ( Orange, Blueberry, Raspberry, Kiwi, Banana, &amp; Blackberry ) which will go into production on July 15th.  The $15,000 goal we need your help to raise here on IndieGoGo will fund the remaining 6 Drellie Bite designs from Batch #2 ( Lemon, Lime, Purple Grape,

SPECIFIC PAIR I DESIRE.”</strong><br/>Due to IndieGoGo's 5 option limit <i>( where we need 6 )</i> in the item creation for perks, we decided the best workaround would be to have you choose from the Batches for now.  Once the campaign has ended we'll contact you directly to verify which Drellie Bite pairs you're adopting.  My sincerest apologies for this inconvenience  &gt;__&lt;</p><p><strong>“SWEET, SO WHY THE FLEXIBLE GOAL?”</strong><br/>It’s all about the momentum!  We want to release these plush altogether, not staggered over the agonizing course of years while we slowly build the funds ourselves - as we’ve had to do with past plush projects.  No matter the result of this campaign, we WILL be producing all 12 of the Drellie Bites.  If we can reach our goal with your support then we can have the full Drellie Bite clutch ready and shipped to you by the end of October, skyrocketing our YTD plush releases to 16!  IndieGoGo’s Flexible Goal option will allow us to keep all funds raised and put them directly towards production of the Batch #2 designs and Egg Capsule should we fail to reach our $15,000 goal.</p><p><strong>“BUT WHAT IF I ORDERED FROM BATCH #2 OR THE FULL SET AND WE DON’T REACH THE GOAL?”</strong><br/>Not to worry folks, as stated above, we WILL be adding all 12 Drellie Bites to our catalog eventually, it’s only a matter of time.  If we are unable to reach the goal we’ll be putting all funds raised here towards production of Batch #2 and the Egg Capsule, while slowly saving up additional funds from our online and conventions sales until we can cover the remainder of the $15,000 goal.  However, this process could take up to an additional year before we can finish funding and get your order shipped, depending of course upon how much more funding is needed once the campaign has ended.  Please keep this in mind while contributing to the Drellie Bite Plush campaign.  If you want your order to arrive by the estimated October 2018 delivery date, you must only order from the Batch #1 options of either the “Early Bird Bites”, “Drellie Bites”, or “Drellie Bites 1/2 Dozen” perks, as those are the only guaranteed designs, regardless of the outcome for this campaign.  Otherwise if you’re dedicated enough to wait if need be, then your contribution serves as a reservation for the perks you’ve ordered.  We’ll be in close contact with you throughout the entire process and your Drellie Bites will ship to you as soon as they’re available :)</p><p><strong>“WHY NOT FUND NEW JUMBOS OR BELLIES INSTEAD?”</strong><br/>We felt the Drellie Bites were the best fit from our Drellie Garden Plush Plan for a crowd funding campaign.  The size of our Bite design means lower production and shipping costs, even though the need to produce 12 variations collectively increases those costs beyond what a few Drellie Belly or single Drellie Jumbo plush campaign would require.  We believe the combination of affordable perks and plush variety that only the Drellie Bites can facilitate will help motivate enough support for this campaign to succeed.  Additionally the Drellie Belly and Drellie Jumbo plush are already represented in our catalog, so we’d like to focus on releasing a new style first.  Having greater variety in plush and price points for our Drellie Garden boutique on the website and at our booth should help us save

Seas</i></p></div>","Hey there folks, my name is Arielle Hill. I’m the heart and art behind Peach Seas.I’ve been passionate about creativity all my life.  As I grew, I traded in my sketchbooks for digital art and my beloved tablet. This creative drive and a healthy fondness for video games lead me to attend Full Sail University pursuing Computer Animation.  Degree in-hand I returned home with hopes of one day utilizing my artistic skill set as a profession.  However for all my budding knowledge fresh out of college, I still lacked enough personal confidence to enter the gaming industry.Instead I found myself working a job in the shipping (and later marketing) department of a local online retailer.  I had experienced everything from order fulfillment to manufacturing in the three years I worked there which sparked a new personal aspiration… With the generous support of my mother, Julie, along with my personal savings I would launch my own brand as a platform to satisfy my creative needs and provide myself a sustainable income in the process.  I began simply with the brand’s name, landing on a phrase that combined two things I love - Peach (my favorite color) + Seas (representing my adoration of ocean life after growing up near the beaches and estuaries of Southwest Florida).  This trend of blending two themes became the blueprint for our Peach Seas boutiques and soon the Drellie Garden was established!Drellies are dragons born with the appearance of their favorite food, sort of a fun nod to camouflage in the natural world.  These creatures are the merging of my love for dragons and interest in plant life, as they are modeled after fruit.  Since 2013 the Garden has steadily grown to include 24 Fruit Drellie characters featured in a range of products including my favorite, PLUSH!  **Fun Fact, the term Drellie came from fusing the word Dragon with my name.Considering our limited capacity for funding and storage along with my desire for variety, I developed the following practical Plush Plan to bring each of these 24 Drellies to life :Drellie Jumbo PlushI wanted these to be BIG and crazy huggable, therefore we could only produce a few due to limited space and costly production.  We chose the following 4 characters based on popularity to feature as Jumbos : Dragonfruit, Avocado, Watermelon, and Pineapple.Drellie Belly PlushThese would be smaller, still cuddly, but more expressive; featuring an array of eye styles to convey emotion.  We chose the following 8 characters to feature as Bellies : Cantaloupe, Cherry, Peach, Mango, Lychee, Coconut, Strawberry, and Pineberry.Drellie Bite PlushThis miniature style would allow us to feasibly produce the remainder of our Fruit Drellie hoard.  And thus the final 12 characters were paired up according to their best buddies to be featured as Bites : Banana & Blackberry, Orange & Blueberry, Raspberry & Kiwi, Lime & Lemon, Red & Green Apple, and White & Purple Grape.Over the years we’ve done our best to save up and personally fund each new endeavor, plush or otherwise, for Peach Seas.  The downside to this method is the sluggish pace we must trudge to breathe life into new and exciting merchandise.  It can take well over a year to save up the kind of dough it takes to finance a project as expensive as plush manufacturing.  Although slow and steady progress coincides with our easy going approach to life and business we’ve begun to turn things up a notch, releasing 4 new plush this year alone!  This recent change of pace has been exhilarating and we’re eager to keep up the momentum.  This is where you come in!  We need your help to keep the ball rollin’ as we focus efforts on our next plush project, the Drellie Bites.“GIVE US THE DEETS ON THOSE PRECIOUS PLUSH!”Our Drellie Bites are made of a super soft minky fabric filled with plastic pellets giving the plush a weighted and satisfying texture to fidget with in your fingers.  These little plush are approximately 3” long, 2” wide, 1.75” tall, and suspended from a 3” elastic chord.  The Egg Capsule (only available through the Drellie Bite Dozen perk) is made of plastic approximately 7” tall and 5” wide with a removable clear top and solid white bottom.  The Drellie Bites are wonderful accessories for your backpack, office desk, suitcase, ball-jointed doll, purse, fruit basket, mobile game-console case, and even your car rear-view mirror!  They would also make an impressive and unique stocking stuffer this holiday season ;)“OK, I’M SOLD!  WHAT’S THE SKINNY ON THIS CAMPAIGN?”As you may have noticed, we’ve finalized the prototypes for these plush.  Now all that’s left is to fund production.  As you may not know, we’ve already accumulated enough money on our own to fund half the Drellie Bites!  Our savings will fund the designs from Batch #1 ( Orange, Blueberry, Raspberry, Kiwi, Banana, & Blackberry ) which will go into production on July 15th.  The $15,000 goal we need your help to raise here on IndieGoGo will fund the remaining 6 Drellie Bite designs from Batch #2 ( Lemon, Lime, Purple Grape, White Grape, Red Apple, & Green Apple ) as well as the Egg Capsules that will hold a full set of Drellie Bites.EARLY BIRD BITES  •  $ 11 + ShippingFirst come first serve adoption rate of 26% OFF for a pair of Drellie Bites.  6 pairs of best friends to choose from ( more info on Drellie selection below ) !LIMITED QUANTITYDRELLIE BITES  •  $ 14 + ShippingAdopt a pair of Drellie Bites at this IndieGoGo exclusive rate.  6 pairs of best friends to choose from ( more info on Drellie selection below ) !*IndieGoGo Exclusive Rate -

Now’s your chance to help support a fellow entrepreneur and reserve our Drellie Bites for resale in your booth or boutique!  Perk includes 15 sets of our 6 Drellie Bite pairs.  Contact me at Arielle@PeachSeas.com if you’re interested in carrying these charming plush as Drellie Bite Dozens within the Egg Capsule.  LIMITED QUANTITY“I CAN ONLY SELECT BATCH 1 OR 2, BUT NOT THE SPECIFIC PAIR I DESIRE.”Due to IndieGoGo's 5 option limit ( where we need 6 ) in the item creation for perks, we decided the best workaround would be to have you choose from the Batches for now.  Once the campaign has ended we'll contact you directly to verify which Drellie Bite pairs you're adopting.  My sincerest apologies for this inconvenience  >__<“SWEET, SO WHY THE FLEXIBLE GOAL?”It’s all about the momentum!  We want to release these plush altogether, not staggered over the agonizing course of years while we slowly build the funds ourselves - as we’ve had to do with past plush projects.  No matter the result of this campaign, we WILL be producing all 12 of the Drellie Bites.  If we can reach our goal with your support then we can have the full Drellie Bite clutch ready and shipped to you by the end of October, skyrocketing our YTD plush releases to 16!  IndieGoGo’s Flexible Goal option will allow us to keep all funds raised and put them directly towards production of the Batch #2 designs and Egg Capsule should we fail to reach our $15,000 goal.“BUT WHAT IF I ORDERED FROM BATCH #2 OR THE FULL SET AND WE DON’T REACH THE GOAL?”Not to worry folks, as stated above, we WILL be adding all 12 Drellie Bites to our catalog eventually, it’s only a matter of time.  If we are unable to reach the goal we’ll be putting all funds raised here towards production of Batch #2 and the Egg Capsule, while slowly saving up additional funds from our online and conventions sales until we can cover the remainder of the $15,000 goal.  However, this process could take up to an additional year before we can finish funding and get your order shipped, depending of course upon how much more funding is needed once the campaign has ended.  Please keep this in mind while contributing to the Drellie Bite Plush campaign.  If you want your order to arrive by the estimated October 2018 delivery date, you must only order from the Batch #1 options of either the “Early Bird Bites”, “Drellie Bites”, or “Drellie Bites 1/2 Dozen” perks, as those are the only guaranteed designs, regardless of the outcome for this campaign.  Otherwise if you’re dedicated enough to wait if need be, then your contribution serves as a reservation for the perks you’ve ordered.  We’ll be in close contact with you throughout the entire process and your Drellie Bites will ship to you as soon as they’re available :)“WHY NOT FUND NEW JUMBOS OR BELLIES INSTEAD?”We felt the Drellie Bites were the best fit from our Drellie Garden Plush Plan for a crowd funding campaign.  The size of our Bite design means lower production and shipping costs, even though the need to produce 12 variations collectively increases those costs beyond what a few Drellie Belly or single Drellie Jumbo plush campaign would require.  We believe the combination of affordable perks and plush variety that only the Drellie Bites can facilitate will help motivate enough support for this campaign to succeed.  Additionally the Drellie Belly and Drellie Jumbo plush are already represented in our catalog, so we’d like to focus on releasing a new style first.  Having greater variety in plush and price points for our Drellie Garden boutique on the website and at our booth should help us save money faster to put back into funding the remaining Belly and Jumbo designs.“WAIT, I CAN'T ORDER THE BITES INDIVIDUALLY -

<h2><strong>What is The Kalon Project?</strong></h2>
<p>Kalon by definition means “<strong>beauty that is more than skin deep.</strong>” That idea is exactly what we want to portray with this audio and visual art exhibition.</p>
<p>We have discovered <u>22 amazing stories</u> of people from around our community that has given us <strong>hope, admiration, and love</strong>. We now feel compelled to share those stories with the world.</p>
<p><u>The Kalon Project</u> will dive <i>deep</i> and share the struggles and darkness that these people have gone through and how it has made these beautiful souls <strong>who they are today</strong>.</p>
<p>We want to present an art exhibit, like no other. One that showcases these 22 inspirational stories in a new light! <u>At the end of 22 weeks, we will share 22 stories in a large art exhibition.</u> Our community will come together and be able to view this compilation of all these very different and painful journeys that all end with perseverance. They’ll share their story with you on how they overcame these difficulties in life to only become stronger in the end.</p>
<p><u>The topics that people will share their stories on include</u>: overcoming depression, the life of a cancer survivor, attempted suicide, life after rape, divorce, battling a drug and alcohol addiction, having a miscarriage, dealing with anxiety and self love, bullying, homosexuality, domestic abuse, being a parent to a transgender child, living with a life-altering disease, life with an eating disorder, growing up with a parent that’s different than other parents, raising a child with disability, guiding a body positive movement, life as a veteran, and the loss of a loved one including, a parent losing their child to cancer, a fiancé tragically passing away two-months before their wedding, a sister losing her brother to suicide, and a daughter losing her parent at a young and influential age.</p>
<p>Did you know that <strong>from ages 10-24 the second leading cause of death is suicide</strong>? And that <u>20 veterans commit suicide EVERY day</u>? It breaks our hearts to report <strong>15-20 percent of all women with a verified pregnancy will end up having a miscarriage</strong>. And that <u>1.3 million women are raped</u> in the U.S. each year.</p>
<p>We want our community to come together to <u>view and share the experiences</u> of these very different and painful journeys that <strong>all end with perseverance</strong> and how they became stronger in the end.</p>

<p><strong>Founder</strong> of <u>The Kalon Project</u>, <strong>Jillian Gunlicks</strong> is mom to 8-year-old, Rylin, and a Sioux Falls native who is an <strong>advocate for change</strong>.</p>
<p>As of late, Jillian has felt extremely compelled to do <u>something greater that will have a profound impact</u> on those within the Sioux Falls community, and hopefully one day, beyond. Enter the initial idea of <u>The Kalon Project.</u> Jillian is someone who has triumphed over her own hardships and felt compelled to share her story, along with the other 21 amazing stories, in hopes to help others see <strong>they are not alone with whatever they are dealing with</strong>. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507577855/i3vd6longqgfezmzl8ud.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Being a local artist, it was obvious that she would use art as a medium to share these stories. Jillian had the inspiration, but was unsure where to start. She describes that she had this perpetual intuition to reach out to <strong>co-founder</strong> of T<u>he Kalon Project</u>, <strong>Chelsea Tracy</strong>.</p>
<p>Chelsea Tracy is a <strong>young Sioux Falls entrepreneur</strong>. Owner of Chelsea’s Boutique, Style by Chelsea, and co-owner of Conversation Piece, Chelsea has a passion for empowering women and making a difference within the community. Also feeling called to do something bigger, Chelsea and Jillian got together where Jillian shared the idea of <u>The Kalon Project</u> and Chelsea was immediately on board.</p>
<p>Wondering <strong>why 22 stories</strong>? The angel number for 22 says it <u>reminds you to listen to your intuition and to follow your heart</u>. Both of which will <strong>guide you in the direction of your life purpose and your highest possible path</strong>. Intuition is ultimately what led Jillian and Chelsea to one another so it only made sense to them that they choose the number 22.</p>
<p>Both women hope this project will make a <strong>heartfelt difference</strong> in the lives of <u>men and women</u> of <strong>all ages, races and religions</strong>. Our hope is to inspire and bring to fruition the <u>light that is in each and every one of us</u>.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>We are looking to raise a minimum of <strong>$15,000</strong> for <u>The Kalon Project</u>. However, <strong>the more we raise, the more we can do with this project</strong>.

Inspiration that is filled with love, light and hope</p>

The Kalon Project is something that we hope to take beyond the South Dakota state lines and we want to capture the essence of this project and all the work is going to be put into it.

I think we can all agree that what the world needs now is LOVE. We need the people in this community and across the world to know that they are not alone with anything they may be going through. We want this to be an inspiring exhibit that is filled with love, light, and hope. We want these 22 stories to be the voices for anyone out there who feel voiceless.
With your help, we can do just that.

DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH COURAGE TO BACK TEAMWORK? 
MiXER is an experiment. Its a cross-disciplinary collaboration between 2 artists who have never met before. This way they are given the opportunity to stimulate
their own creativity, exchange and develop as artists and as humans.
