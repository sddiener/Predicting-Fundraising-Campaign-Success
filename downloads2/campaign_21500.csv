In recent years, we have discussed the topics of family & generation gap, of human trafficking, and of adoption history.Your contribution to our campaign will fund the items that we design and create ourselves.Our show is on April 12. The script is written, our crew is assembled, and we already have a cast. We've also secured a venue, but the world-class stage of Zellerbach Hall costs a whopping $18,000 on its own!We're asking you to help us with the creative expenses. The funds raised will go directly and immediately into use for our marketing collateral, backdrops, stage props, and costumes. $3,500 is the amount we need to get the minimum amount of supplies.This year, our show is about acceptance, about resilience, and about love.Ảo Ảnh: Between the Lines opens the book on one family and their history of mental illness. It tells the story of a mother and daughter, Jennifer and Kasey, struggling to overcome the taboo of talking about mental illness.Mental illness is a difficult topic to discuss, and it tends to be ignored and downplayed in many families and communities, but pretending that it doesn't exist doesn't make it go away. Through this show, we wish to portray the consequences of untreated mental illness and the importance of communication and acceptance, especially within the family. Although there are many who may not necessarily understand or know how to treat or to cope with a mental illness, we believe that everyone has the ability to take the first step — everyone has the ability to speak up.Help us spread the word!

People!</b></p>
<p><i>Dance is for me a balancing act between perfection and
beauty. It is a language without words; the expression of our soul. We can't
dance in the past or in the future, but dance is always here and now with all of
our self!</i></p>
<p>I am Eva Kolarova, professional dancer and choreographer,
originally from Czech Republic. Since the age of 15 I have traveled with dance
all over the world. I have lived in 3 different countries and am currently
dancing as a demi-soloist with   Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in
Montreal for the third year.</p>
<p>I love to dance. But since my childhood I have always felt
a desire to create my own steps; my own dance language. So I started to
choreograph and  it soon became my
passion, and something I want to do in the future  in addition to dancing.</p>
<p>I was recently accepted to the renown dance festival “Quartiers
Danses” this September 2014 in Montreal at theatre Le Gesu.</p>
<p> (For more
details:  <a href=""http://www.quartiersdanses.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.quartiersdanses.com/</a> )</p>
<p>I also plan to bring to life my own full-length
performance to introduce to the public next year!</p>
<p>So what I am asking you is to help me meet the costs
of attending this great festival and my path to create my new show next year.</p><p><b>Money will be used:</b></p><p><b>1. pay all the people who are involved in my creation !<br/>2. money on costumes , props ( projector, screen )<br/>3. and most important, remaining money will allow me to rent theater space and technicians for the realization of my full-length performance !</b><br/></p>
<p>My new creation Cycle will be presented in the
festival this fall. It started from a great opportunity to collaborate for the
first time with outstanding composer <a href=""http://www.reikoyamada.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reiko Yamada</a>,
cellist <a href=""http://www.juansebastiandelgado.com/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Juan Sebastian Delgado</a> and film director <a href=""https://vimeo.com/lucianamarcos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Luciana Marcos</a> in cooperation with cinematographer <a href=""https://vimeo.com/derekbranscombe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Derek Branscombe</a>. Reiko composed wonderful
music that will be played on stage by cellist, together with the dance and combined
with video projection.</p>
<p><b>Little synopsis of Cycle:</b></p>
<p><span>I've always wondered. Everything in
nature takes place in certain periods, everything is repeated, each time in a
slightly different form, but the basic principles remain unchanged; it's just
different variations , viewpoints and under different conditions.<br/><span>And that fascinates me. I want to capture one
story out of thousands. Each human being goes through a period of spring,
summer, autumn and winter, but that is not the end , because after winter comes
spring again! Every beginning has an end, and without end there would be no
beginning!</span></span></p>

<p><i>Pro mě je tanec, balancování mezi dokonalostí a
krásou, jde o řeč beze slov o projev duše. Nemůžeme tančit v minulosti ani v
budoucnosti, ale tančíme vždy tady a teď celým svým já!</i></p>
<p>Jmenuji se Eva Kolářová a jsem profesionální
tanečnice a choreografka, narozená v 
České republice. Od svých patnácti let jsem začala, díky tanci, cestovat
po celém světě. Žila jsem ve třech různých zemích, a v současné době tančím
jako demi - sólistka v Les Grands Balletu Canadiens v Montrealu, již
třetím rokem.<br/><br/><span>Miluji tanec! 
Ale už jako malá jsem vždy pociťovala potřebu vytvářet své vlastní
kroky, svůj taneční jazyk. A tak se choreografování brzy stalo mou vášní, něčím
co chci dělat v budoucnu spolu s tancem.

</span></p><p>Momentálně jsem byla vybraná na velmi důležitý choreografický
festival – Quartiers Danses, který se koná každoročně v září
v Montreálu a pro mě je velkou poctou se ho zúčastnit se svou novou kreací
„ Koloběh“ .</p>
<p>( Pro více informací : <a href=""http://www.quartiersdanses.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.quartiersdanses.com</a> )</p>
<p><span>Dále chci přivést k životu, své vlastní
celovečerní představení a prezentovat ho veřejnosti příští rok !</span></p>
<p><span>To o co vás žádám, je pomoc s uhrazením
nákladů, které jsou spojené s účastí na festivalu Qurtiers Danses a mou
další choreografickou tvorbu směřující k uvedení  celovečerního představení v příštím

<p>Již jako malé dítě (od 5 let), začala s výukou
akrobacie, herectvím, malováním a hraním na klavír.</p>
<p>Teprve později 
(od 8 let), začala s výukou moderního tance a baletu.</p>
<p>V 10 letech složila přijímací zkoušky na Státní
taneční konzervatoř v Praze. Zároveň pokračovala ve studiu na soukromé umělecké
škole Actors Studio.</p>
<p>Její velký talent, píle a ambice, způsobili, že
po dalších čtyřech letech studia její otec natočil jak tančí tři náročné,
moderní choreografie a zaslal film do Švýcarska. </p>
<p>Díky tomu byla pozvána na konkurz do světoznámé
školy Maurice Béjarta v Lausanne, kam posléze v 15 letech ( o rok mladší, než
byla školou stanovená spodní věková hranice ) sama odjela studovat. </p>
<p>Měla to obrovské štěstí pracovat se samotným
M.Béjartem a též tančit v některých jeho představeních v  souboru „Béjart Ballet Lausanne“ i možnost
presentovat se na vystoupení svou vlastní sólovou choreografií. </p>
<p>Po dokončení studií v Lausanne, v 17  letech udělala konkurz do „Baletní Akademie v
Mnichově“  - „Hoschule fur Kunst und
Musik“, kde mimo jiné také tančila s „Bayerisches Staatsballettem“ pod vedením
Ivana Lišky.</p>
<p>Po ukončení vysoké školy a obdržení diplomu,
opustila Německo a zároveň dostala nabídku smlouvy ve Francii v souboru „Ballet
de l´Opéra National du Rhin“, od ředitele Bertranta D´Ata.</p>
<p>Zde tancovala po dobu tří let, kdy si dále rozvíjela
své znalosti díky velmi širokému rejstříku repertoáru od úplné klasiky ( jako
např.: „La Sylphide"", Giselle aj. ) přes světoznámé choreografy ( jako
J.Kylián, L. Childs, W.Forsythe, M.Béjart , J.Inger,Hans van Manen ad. ) až k
tanečnímu divadlu.</p>
<p>Také byla vybraná reprezentovat „Ballet du Rhin“
na Gala představení </p>
<p>“40th Anniversary Gala of Northern Ballet
Theatre´s” v Leedsu v Anglii, či na Gala v Praze ve Stavovském divadle.</p>
<p>Na jaře 2011 se rozhodla pro změnu a dostala
nabídku smlouvy v Montreálu, od Gradimíra Pankova  ředitele divadla „Grands Ballets Canadien“.</p>
<p>S tancem projezdila mnoho zemí světa :  od Španělska,Francie,Lucemburska,
Švýcarska,Německa,Itálie, Řecka, Holandska přes Jižní Koreu až  Čínu a momentálně pracuje v Kanadě. </p>
<p>Už od mlada jí přitahovala choreografie jako
taková.</p>
<p>Svou první cenu za choreografii získala jako
věkově podlimitní ( v 13 letech ) </p>
<p>na soutěži Jarmily Jeřábkové v Praze. </p>
<p>Od té doby si průběžně tvořila své choreografie,
až během studií v Německu, v roce 2007 poprvé spolu-realizovala celovečerní
představení „Taneční portrét Evy Kolářové“, převážně z vlastní tvorby v Praze v
divadle ABC.</p>
<p>Mimo jiné se zúčastnila několika choreografických
a tanečních soutěží, z kterých si odnesla nejednu první cenu.</p>
<p>Poroty a taneční veřejnost vždy a znova zaujímá
precizností pohybu, přirozenou elegancí, svou výraznou osobitostí a jí
specifickou poetičností.</p>
<p>Choreograficky spolupracovala na celovečerním
představení pro „Ballet du Rhin“. </p>
<p>Také udělala tři choreografie pro Taneční konzervatoř
v St.Louise a pro Taneční konzervatoř v Mulhouse.</p>
<p>Byla pozvaná na několik Gala představení v Praze
a naposledy v červnu 2012 na Gala do Soulu v Jižní Koreji. </p>
<p>Také úspěšně zrealizovala a uvedla své
celovečerní představení „Metamorfózy lásky“ složené z jejích choreografií
v divadle La Chapelle 11. a 12.srpna v Montreálu.  </p>
<p>Ohlas místní taneční kritiky byl velmi dobrý.</p>
<p>Momentálně se plně soustředí na svou novou kreaci

Pro mě je tanec, balancování mezi dokonalostí a
krásou, jde o řeč beze slov o projev duše. Nemůžeme tančit v minulosti ani v
budoucnosti, ale tančíme vždy tady a teď celým svým já!
Jmenuji se Eva Kolářová a jsem profesionální
tanečnice a choreografka, narozená v 
České republice. Od svých patnácti let jsem začala, díky tanci, cestovat
po celém světě. Žila jsem ve třech různých zemích, a v současné době tančím
jako demi - sólistka v Les Grands Balletu Canadiens v Montrealu, již
třetím rokem.Miluji tanec! 
Ale už jako malá jsem vždy pociťovala potřebu vytvářet své vlastní
kroky, svůj taneční jazyk. A tak se choreografování brzy stalo mou vášní, něčím
co chci dělat v budoucnu spolu s tancem.

Momentálně jsem byla vybraná na velmi důležitý choreografický
festival – Quartiers Danses, který se koná každoročně v září
v Montreálu a pro mě je velkou poctou se ho zúčastnit se svou novou kreací
„ Koloběh“ .
( Pro více informací : www.quartiersdanses.com )
Dále chci přivést k životu, své vlastní
celovečerní představení a prezentovat ho veřejnosti příští rok !
To o co vás žádám, je pomoc s uhrazením
nákladů, které jsou spojené s účastí na festivalu Qurtiers Danses a mou
další choreografickou tvorbu směřující k uvedení  celovečerního představení v příštím
roce.
Peníze budou použity : 1. výplata všem lidem, kteří se podílejí na mé kreaci ( tanečníci, skladatelka, režisérka, čelista a technici ) !2. peníze na kostýmy , rekvizity, ( projektor, plátno )3. a to nejdůležitější, peníze které zbudou mi umožní pronájem divadelní prostory a techniků, na realizaci mého celovečerního představení !Má nová choreografie „Koloběh se zrodila
z příležitosti spolupráce s vynikající skladatelkou Reiko Yamadou ,
violoncellistou Juanem Sebastianem Delgadem a režisérkou Lucianou Marcos, ve spolupráci s Dereckem Branscombem .
Reiko pro mě složila nádhernou hudbu a mým cílem
je, aby spolu s tancem a videoprojekcí vytvořila dokonalou symbiózu,aby
navzájem každá složka násobila svou sílu. Violoncellista bude doprovázet
tanečníky během vystoupení na jevišti.
Krátký obsah Koloběhu:
O nos mi zavadila myšlenka, která mě zaujala a od
té doby jsem o ní několikrát přemýšlela. V přírodě se všechno odehrává
v určitých cyklech, obdobích, vše se opakuje, pokaždé jen v poněkud
jiné podobě, ale základ, podstata zůstává beze změny, jde jen o různé varianty,
úhly pohledu a odlišné podmínky.                                A to mě fascinuje.
Chci zachytit tento princip v jednom příběhu
vyňatém z tisíce podobných, kdy každá lidská bytost projde svým obdobím
jara, léta, podzimu a zimy, ale po zimě není konec, protože přichází opět jaro!

Každý začátek má konec a bez konce by nebyl
začátek. Jde o nekonečnou spirálu. A my koneckonců jsem jen pouhým vesmírným
prachem.
Já tancem žiji! Je to pro mě způsob vyjádření ! A proto opravdu ocením veškerou podporu, kterou
mi můžete poskytnout. Ať už to bude finanční dar / nebo šířením slova
doufám, že společně dojdeme k cíli!Děkuju mnohokrát.SrdečněEva Kolářová-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Eva Kolářová – životopis
Již jako malé dítě (od 5 let), začala s výukou
akrobacie, herectvím, malováním a hraním na klavír.
Teprve později 
(od 8 let), začala s výukou moderního tance a baletu.
V 10 letech složila přijímací zkoušky na Státní
taneční konzervatoř v Praze. Zároveň pokračovala ve studiu na soukromé umělecké
škole Actors Studio.
Její velký talent, píle a ambice, způsobili, že
po dalších čtyřech letech studia její otec natočil jak tančí tři náročné,
moderní choreografie a zaslal film do Švýcarska. 
Díky tomu byla pozvána na konkurz do světoznámé
školy Maurice Béjarta v Lausanne, kam posléze v 15 letech ( o rok mladší, než
byla školou stanovená spodní věková hranice ) sama odjela studovat. 
Měla to obrovské štěstí pracovat se samotným
M.Béjartem a též tančit v některých jeho představeních v  souboru „Béjart Ballet Lausanne“ i možnost
presentovat se na vystoupení svou vlastní sólovou choreografií. 
Po dokončení studií v Lausanne, v 17  letech udělala konkurz do „Baletní Akademie v
Mnichově“  - „Hoschule fur Kunst und
Musik“, kde mimo jiné také tančila s „Bayerisches Staatsballettem“ pod vedením
Ivana Lišky.
Po ukončení vysoké školy a obdržení diplomu,
opustila Německo a zároveň dostala nabídku smlouvy ve Francii v souboru „Ballet
de l´Opéra National du Rhin“, od ředitele Bertranta D´Ata.
Zde tancovala po dobu tří let, kdy si dále rozvíjela
své znalosti díky velmi širokému rejstříku repertoáru od úplné klasiky ( jako
např.: „La Sylphide"", Giselle aj. ) přes světoznámé choreografy ( jako
J.Kylián, L. Childs, W.Forsythe, M.Béjart , J.Inger,Hans van Manen ad. ) až k
tanečnímu divadlu.
Také byla vybraná reprezentovat „Ballet du Rhin“
na Gala představení 
“40th Anniversary Gala of Northern Ballet
Theatre´s” v Leedsu v Anglii, či na Gala v Praze ve Stavovském divadle.
Na jaře 2011 se rozhodla pro změnu a dostala
nabídku smlouvy v Montreálu, od Gradimíra Pankova  ředitele divadla „Grands Ballets Canadien“.
S tancem projezdila mnoho zemí světa :  od Španělska,Francie,Lucemburska,
Švýcarska,Německa,Itálie, Řecka, Holandska přes Jižní Koreu až  Čínu a momentálně pracuje v Kanadě. 
Už od mlada jí přitahovala choreografie jako
taková.
Svou první cenu za choreografii získala jako
věkově podlimitní ( v 13 letech ) 
na soutěži Jarmily Jeřábkové v Praze. 
Od té doby si průběžně tvořila své choreografie,
až během studií v Německu, v roce 2007 poprvé spolu-realizovala celovečerní
představení „Taneční portrét Evy Kolářové“, převážně z vlastní tvorby v Praze v
divadle ABC.
Mimo jiné se zúčastnila několika choreografických
a tanečních soutěží, z kterých si odnesla nejednu první cenu.
Poroty a taneční veřejnost vždy a znova zaujímá
precizností pohybu, přirozenou elegancí, svou výraznou osobitostí a jí
specifickou poetičností.
Choreograficky spolupracovala na celovečerním
představení pro „Ballet du Rhin“. 
Také udělala tři choreografie pro Taneční konzervatoř
v St.Louise a pro Taneční konzervatoř v Mulhouse.
Byla pozvaná na několik Gala představení v Praze
a naposledy v červnu 2012 na Gala do Soulu v Jižní Koreji. 
Také úspěšně zrealizovala a uvedla své
celovečerní představení „Metamorfózy lásky“ složené z jejích choreografií
v divadle La Chapelle 11. a 12.srpna v Montreálu.  
Ohlas místní taneční kritiky byl velmi dobrý.
Momentálně se plně soustředí na svou novou kreaci
„Koloběh“, která se uskuteční v Montrealu v rámci choreografického
festivalu Quartiers Danses v divadle Le Gesu 13.září 2014.

about topics that are relevant to their needs as citizens.  Our first show – Aunty Ben – is about to
premiere at the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival, before transferring
to the Brighton Fringe Festival, and we need your help to launch it!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Aunty Ben is a very pioneering show – it is a play for children
(and adults!) aged 7+, about a drag queen. 
The story revolves around <span>nine-year-old Tracey’s relationship with her
favourite aunty, Ben. It doesn't matter to Tracey at all that Aunty Ben is
actually her uncle, or that he is a drag queen, because in Tracey’s family
dressing up is for everyone! But when Ben meets her school friends, Tracey is
shocked to discover that other people’s families can be very different to her
own. Aunty Ben is a colourful and playful exploration of gender issues, acceptance,
love and happiness created specifically for, and tailored to the needs of,
primary school aged children. Most of all, Aunty Ben is a sensitive and
entertaining celebration of diversity, dignity, and marching to the beat of
your own drum.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Throughout our rehearsal
process, we have been inviting contributions from teachers, academics, theatre

</h3><p><b><i><u>The Beginning – It’s A-L.I.V.E.!</u></i></b></p>
<p>It
all started with three Chicago-based friends who had a common trait: they loved
to entertain. Whether they did it through theater, games, writing or
improvisation, they loved to see people laughing, thrilling, and just plain old
having a good time. They had oodles of zany ideas just chomping at the bit to
become a reality, but they knew from the get go that they couldn’t bring their
dreams to life on their own. So, in the summer of 2012, Shane Hill, Andrew
Huttel and Derrick Gaetke started talking about getting together some
like-minded folks and seeing what they could do with their powers combined…
besides summoning a super-powered ecological PSA, of course (they could already
do that). They shared some of their ideas with their friends in Chicago’s art community,
and soon found themselves surrounded with fantastic, talented people who all
wanted to join in the dream. Before they knew it, Locked Into Vacancy
Entertainment, or “L.I.V.E.” for short, was born.</p>
<p>L.I.V.E.’s
first project, the Bronson’s Lozenges Astounding Imagination Showcase
Extravaganza, is a stage show performed and recorded in the style of old time
radio serials. Filled with original scripts, songs, sponsors and sound effects
– all of them provided by writers and performers in the Chicago area – what
many have come to recognize as the “L.I.V.E. Radio Show” has met with
overwhelmingly positive reactions. Audiences have been thrilled to experience brand
new adventures and characters in a way many of them hadn’t before, where the
audio gives them the backbone but their imaginations are free to fill in the
rest. Soon after the radio show’s debut more talented people approached the
members of L.I.V.E. asking how they could get involved, and the company grew.
The BLAISE radio show continues to entertain and delight audiences on a
bimonthly basis at the Public House Theater in Chicago, IL, with plans for a
monthly show starting January of 2015. If you don’t live in or around Chicago
and want to get in on the fun, podcast recordings of the live shows are

We are local to Humboldt County in Northern California, Eureka area, and run as a collective. We choreograph and perform many different styles of belly dance from areas like Turkey, Egypt, Morocco and sometimes fuse them with modern western styles of dance. We are collaborating with local band Musaic (they perform various folk music from Hungary, Romania, Macedonia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, Armenia, Turkey, Scandinavia, Ireland, Mexico &amp; more) to make their songs come alive! We have excellent choreographers, dancers and musicians all collaborating to make a beautiful show. We are producing this event through a local non-profit, Mosaic Productions, a dreammaker project with the Ink People, but we need your help to pay for the venue rentals, insurance, and artists.</p>
<p>There will be three shows: </p>
<p>Friday March 27 @ The Eureka Women’s Club, Eureka CA</p>
<p>Saturday March 28 @ Redwood Raks, Arcata CA</p>
<p>Sunday March 29 @ Trinidad Town Hall, Trinidad CA</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp;
What You Get</b></p>
<p>Our idea behind this campaign is to fund the project before
the show instead of relying on tickets sales. Our goal is to get the community
excited about our show by contributing; anyone donating will be helping to make
this show happen! Our funding will pay for: renting the theaters, insurance,
paying the non-profit fees, and paying the artists. If you contribute then you
get to come to the show! </p>
<p>We have really cool perks including CDs, belly dance and
music classes, special performances and of course tickets to one of our three
shows. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, any of the funds we do
receive will go towards renting the venues and paying insurance. That will be
the biggest overhead. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>If you live in Humboldt, chances are you have seen Ya Habibi
perform around town. We perform at lots of different events from festivals to charities
and local shows. But we don't often get the opportunity to put on a full length belly
dance concert, especially to live music. </p>

What We Need &
What You Get
Our idea behind this campaign is to fund the project before
the show instead of relying on tickets sales. Our goal is to get the community
excited about our show by contributing; anyone donating will be helping to make
this show happen! Our funding will pay for: renting the theaters, insurance,
paying the non-profit fees, and paying the artists. If you contribute then you
get to come to the show! 
We have really cool perks including CDs, belly dance and

the biggest overhead. 
The Impact
If you live in Humboldt, chances are you have seen Ya Habibi
perform around town. We perform at lots of different events from festivals to charities
and local shows. But we don't often get the opportunity to put on a full length belly
dance concert, especially to live music. 
This project gives us the opportunity to:

Collaborate with local artists and musicians


Work on choreography and present it in a
professional setting


Showcase local talent


This project gives the community a chance to:

Support local artists


See a type of concert this is very rare to this
area!

You all remember ""Disney's Aladdin Jr?"" and who could forget ""Night at the Wax Museum?"" Our most recent success ""Christmas in Oz, Y'all"" has really pushed our drive to create the best productions for you, our community, and our actors, both young and...seasoned. </p>
<p></p>
<p>BeanStalk Community Theatre is dedicated
to bringing quality theatrical experiences to the youth of the high country and
their families. We involve members in all aspects of production from backstage
to on stage! Our productions promote teamwork, commitment, and exceptional work
ethic, allowing families to spend quality time together while creating an
excellent theatre experience for our audience.</p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We want to make our next summer production our best yet! Our goal in this campaign is to raise enough money to rent and/or build professional costumes.</p>
<p>Our average budget for a show like this is $10,000.00! It costs more than you imagine to do all that we do to pull these shows off. With your help in raising just 1/4 of our budget we can outfit our cast with great costumes for a magical show. If we are able to build our costumes rather than rent them, we can generate income for years to come by renting them out to other theatre companies.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>We hope that you will find it in your heart to donate
to this worthy cause so that we may continue to bring quality theatre to our
community.</p>
<p>Involvement in the arts is associated with gains in math, reading, cognitive ability, critical thinking, and verbal skills. Arts learning can also improve motivation, concentration, confidence, and teamwork. A 2005 <a href=""http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG290"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">report by the Rand Corporation about the visual arts</a> argues that the intrinsic pleasures and stimulation of the arts experience do more than sweeten an individual's life. According to the report, they ""can connect people more deeply to the world and open them to new ways of seeing,"" creating the foundation to forge social bonds and community cohesion. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The economy has taken a toll on everyone. Arts programs are being removed from schools due to budget cuts. Stage musicals are being made into movies. If we band together, share our story, and each give a little, then our goal can be met easily. Please remember how much you have enjoyed each performance either as a performer or community member and consider donating. Any amount will help.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We hope we make our goal, but even if we don't remember The Show Must Go On!</span></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Even if you cannot give now, maybe skip that latte tomorrow and give a little then. Perhaps, you have experience building costumes, props, or sets and would like to donate your time.</p>

The creation of 'High as Sugar' is a small part of that process. </p>
<p>THE STORY: We believe that Holly's story is important. It's a story not about gender identity, but simply <i>identity</i>. Holly Woodlawn told the New York Times in 1970, ""I’m not afraid of playing a man; I was born a man. And I’m not afraid of being a woman. I love women. Too much is made of gender. I want people to say of me,‘Here is a person who has something to offer besides gender.’""</p>

Why This Project is Important:

Projects like these are our way of offering our full potential to others. This project in particular has so much creative energy behind it, it is important that we get to share our vision with the world! In addition, many of us see this project as a jumping off point to continue to develop our careers as artists. 

The Nitty Gritty--The Money:

We will use funding for rehearsal space, a camera dolly, an extra camera battery (we will be filming in the cold where there is no electricity), costume materials, aerial silks fabric and equipment, and travel expenses. 

If we do not reach our goal the project will still run but we will not be able to fully express the vision of the piece (for example we might only have one aerialist instead of two, which compromises the theme of unison that runs through the choreography).

My most recent project, completed with no funding, was a documentary on London's acclaimed Arcola Theatre called ""I am Going to Make a Miracle"".  The film premiered in the Dhaka International film Festival and will appear in Berlin in May and in Fountainhead's Black International film Festival.</p>
<p>Circles was inspired by my desire to try to examine the rise of homophobia in the African and Afro-Caribbean community.  But in the wake of both the London riots and the on-going banking crisis the project became much larger.  Circles is now a site-specific, multi-media theatre piece which looks at how theatre can take an audience behind our current newspaper headlines, into the heart of stories we are so greatly affected by today and in doing so perhaps alter how we see them.  All four stories will have a loose connection with HIV/AIDS but these are not HIV/AIDS stories per se but rather stories about our ability to feel compassion for others and our willingness to see the world through their eyes. The stories are</p>
<p><strong>Michael's Story</strong> - set in New York's hedonistic mid 1970's. Located in a gay club we see a touching coming of age story of a gay teenager searching for his true idenity against the backdrop of the vicious homophobia endemic at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Henry's Story</strong> - set in an investment bank, not unlike Lehman Brothers, where an executive has to choose between his loyalty to the bank and his own moral conscious. </p>
<p><strong>Jean's Story</strong> - set on the second day of the London riots, where an African immigrant teenager starts to see the true costs of gang loyality.</p>
<p><strong>Pastor Mustapha's Story</strong> - set in present day Uganda, where a Christian minster feels the moral salvation of his country depends on the passing of a parlimentary bill which will make being gay an act punishable by imprisonment and then for repeated offenders death. Unbeknowst to him, his own son is both gay and  HIV positive.  </p>
<p>These four pieces will all be performed over the course of a week in  locations around London. The conclusions of all four stories will be influenced by the four adjectives audience members will be asked to text. And these adjectives will of course be influenced by the audience's ability to feel compassion for the characters they see. </p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Impact </strong></h3>
<p>We hope that this initial workshop performance will lead to an opportunity to tour the show internationally.  We feel that the contributions contributors make will be absoltuely vital in helping to raise the profile of Circles. Something that everyone who is currently working on this project feels is absolutely crucial.  In an increasingly polarized world, your help will enable us to create a theatrical piece which does what we feel is so needed right now, i.e. allow groups traditionally opposed to one another have some kind of forum for dialogue and maybe, just maybe come away with some kind of understanding of each other's lives.</p>
<p> </p></div>","What We Need and What You Get

Others Ways you can Help
We know not everyone can contribute but for those who cannot it would help us so much if you could simply tell your friends about our Indiegogo campaign and use the Indiegogo SHARE TOOLs which are available.  
 
The Team
Circles is a collaboration between former Royal Shakespeare Company's resident director Vik Sivalingam, playwright and documentary film director Beverly Andrews, creative producer Esther Nissard, Bafta nominated filmmaker Dan Saul, singer/composer Lyra Laura Veroli, musical producer Bruno D'ambra and cameraman Paul Trenholme. 
This initial workshop performance will take place on the 6th of May at London's Arcola Theatre's tent and then continue on the 9th, 10th, 11th at various locations throughout the city with all four conclusions performed at the Baldwin Room at London's prestigious Tricycle Theatre. That performance will be followed by a Q and A with members of the cast, the director, the playwright and the audience. We also hope to have a representative from an HIV/AIDS support organization present.

The Matryoshka Doll is Constantine Lignos' senior thesis project at NYU's Experimental Theatre Wing.  The show revolves around a New Jersey housewife who recently got a hysterectomy and is having trouble identifying with her femininity.  In an attempt to rediscover her sexuality, she dreams of becoming some of history's most iconic females, including Cleopatra, Lucille Ball, and Cleo from Rio, a stripper reminiscent of Gypsy Rose Lee.
The show runs from April 18-21 at New York University's Shop Theatre on the 2nd Floor of 721 Broadway, New York, NY 10003.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Myles Malik McGee is the best man I have ever met in my life. I am Tim Crocker, one of Myles' best friends. When we met as freshmen at The University of Hawaii, I knew there was something different about Myles. He was impassioned. Pursuing his acting and dancing career energized Myles from his very soul. That energy spread like a sneeze or laughter to everyone Myles has ever touched in life.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>How many of us have ever had a dream, and how many of us have seen that dream fade and the real world kick in. Bills take priority over passion and vision. Myles doesn't allow that to hinder him and he encourages others to follow their dreams. If it weren't for Myles, I would be working as a server for the rest of my life. Because of his leadership, I am now actively pursuing my dream of a micro-lender to help people help themselves.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Impact Myles<br/>
</h3>
<p>The $1,000 dollar goal is a high aspiration. Myles would walk to New York if he had to, live on the street itself and sleep in a cardboard box if it meant he was eventually achieving his life-long goal, but as his friend, I would greatly like to try and help him out instead. Get Myles established in NYC, so he can amaze us all in the future.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>See that video posted, that's Myles' dance submission to LMFAO for a chance to represent on an international video. Please, watch the video and ""like"" it so Myles can go as far as possible with his talent and passion. Other than that, do you have any connections to acting/dancing in NYC? Check out all the videos posted and send your favorite to your network. Ideas spread like a wildfire, so passion should spread even quicker.<br/></p>

<p>Founded in 2006 as the non-profit Rampart Theater Project Inc., we make theater, dance and performance events in a beautiful converted warehouse space that we have named Bootleg Theater.  Owned by theater artists since 1998, the space has evolved into an inclusive performing arts space where the most exciting Los Angeles artists perform and commune.  Our Artistic Director, Alicia Adams, had been researching the women of Toulouse Lautrec's paintings for years, fascinated by these women who were pioneering artists of their own.  Inspired by the exciting theater happening at Bootleg and all over Los Angeles,  the people who run Bootleg have come together to offer up their own ante.</p>
<p><strong>An original dream play that links the world of women in </strong><strong>Toulouse Lautrec's paintings to the men who loved them. </strong><strong>Through words, movement and love the divine feminine of the </strong><strong>past gains strength as a surreal absinthe night of drinking opens </strong><strong>up a world that will enchant, challenge, frighten and inspire. </strong></p>
<p>Based on research of the period by Bootleg Artistic Director, Alicia Adams, and on the writings of Bob Dylan, Jane Avril, Yvette Guilbert, Suzanne Valadon, Steve Connell, and Alphonse Allais, the letters of Toulouse Lautrec, interviews with David Lynch, Scott Shepherd, William Styron, Alexis Rockman and the words of Brene Brown from her TED conference.</p>
<p>Bridge the Gap between waking and dreaming. <strong>A Fried Octopus</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to make this piece, we are turning to our own Bootleg community, one that has evolved and grown over the past seven years.   The theater pieces we make are entirely funded by donations and grant money.  The Bootleg Bar is a separate entity that cares for the venue, but it doesn't fund the art.  Art needs patrons and we're looking to you to jump on board this ride with us. </p>
<p>Artists creating this project include: Alicia Adams, Justin Zsebe, Jessica Hanna, Kirk Wilson, Jason Adams, Kate Robertson, Michael Dunn, Lulu Brud, Will Watkins, Kera Arman, Licia Perea, Adam Flemming and Francois-Pierre Couture.</p>
<p>We are going to raise $12,000 and all of that money will go toward materials, artists &amp; designer fees, production crew and all the other little details that are needed to make a piece of theater.  Any amount that you can give will be incredibly useful.  It will all go into the project.</p>
<p>Bootleg Theater has never attempted a major donation campaign.  We have been able to keep making Art for 7 years through box office, space rental and grants, just squeeking by, yet still making some of the most successful theater in Los Angeles.  Bootleg produced theater is consistently nominated for Ovations, LA Weeklies and the LADCC Awards.  We've produced hundreds of productions and worked with thousands of amazing artists.  We make the most of the resources we have and we give artists the space &amp; support to do their best work.  Now we want to give the artists who make Bootleg Theater a chance to work on a piece of theater of their own.  And we want you to be a part of it.</p>
<p>Your generous donations will put you in the mix, you will be part of the process...a part of the Bootleg team!  There are all kinds of levels to be included with rewards of all sorts: mentions in our program and on our website, all the way to a year long VIP pass to Bootleg events. </p>
<p><strong>Please look at the contribution levels and perks and decide what works for you. A contribution of any amount will help bring this show to life.</strong></p>

A plea to raise expenses that have already been expended lacks a certain current of sizzle and spark. Various pre-production curve-balls - including a necessary re-casting and the sudden loss mid-rehearsal of our stage-manager, plus the initial lack of a promotional person, meant our campaign kicked off at the same time our show did. We need to cherish it as a learning-process. However, the production itself was a su bstantial success, well-received (by an audience of 400 plus, well-reviewed and outstandingly ensembled. And it did inspire the JP core to begin planninfg future production (incl. a revival of The Specials) in the Spring. Also in planning are ongoing workshops, presentations and dialogues. Possibly under the non-profit rubric of Rainbow recycling, my own company, whose original mission statement was ""to promote sustainability and environmental awareness through inspiring, entertaining and educational arts programs. We look forward to activating such a mission in the very near future. And we vouchsafe any past or future donations will be used to this purpose.

 Our premier production of The Specials concluded a few weeks ago, and our fund-raising juice seems to have got up and gone. A plea to raise expenses that have already been expended lacks a certain current of sizzle and spark. Various pre-production curve-balls - including a necessary re-casting and the sudden loss mid-rehearsal of our stage-manager, plus the initial lack of a promotional person, meant our campaign kicked off at the same time our show did. We need to cherish it as a learning-process. However, the production itself was a su bstantial success, well-received (by an audience of 400 plus, well-reviewed and outstandingly ensembled. And it did inspire the JP core to begin planninfg future production (incl. a revival of The Specials) in the Spring. Also in planning are ongoing workshops, presentations and dialogues. Possibly under the non-profit rubric of Rainbow recycling, my own company, whose original mission statement was ""to promote sustainability and environmental awareness through inspiring, entertaining and educational arts programs. We look forward to activating such a mission in the very near future. And we vouchsafe any past or future donations will be used to this purpose. Meanwhile we'd like to sincerely thank all who contributed to us, with money, time, talent or encouragement, and we trust in your future support which we will continue to strive to earn.

We're a new source of live theater and brand new plays in Connecticut
New Haven, Conn. has long been a not-so-secret place for great theater at reasonable prices. Many plays born here have gone on to become national favorites while new collaborations and loyal theater-goers continue to make New Haven a vibrant theater town. 
“The Specials,” a new drama by playwright Steve Bellwood, has emerged from just such a collaboration.  This contemporary American story was created by a new partnership between Bellwood, Director James Leaf and Producer David Pilot under the auspices of nine-year-old underground theater company Jackdaw-Pike.  It is the first in a series of theater events being planned by the company.  The world premiere of ""The Specials"" is September 14, at the Whitney Arts Center in New Haven, CT. There will be five performances, from Sept. 14 to 22. (See full dates and times below) A dozen inspired professionals have worked for months to bring it to the stage and it has paid off with a play that is tightly written and a cast we are very proud of. We have worked hard to arrange the best possible terms to keep costs low and have received generous help from the community: Long Wharf Theater and The New Haven Theater Company have helped with some of the props, costumes and lighting; rehearsal space was generously donated by Bob and Susan Frew of Frew Management in New Haven and Never Ending Books has provided unending encouragement.The Whitney Arts Center in New Haven has offered generous terms for a 99-seat theater, agreeing to split the door with us 50-50. And most important, we are committed to making theater accessible to everybody by setting the price of admission at FREE,  with a suggested donation of $15 per ticket for those who can.Our fundraising goal of $8,500 will pay talented actors and cover the remaining costs for props, costumes, lighting, transportation, insurance required by both Equity and the venue, publicity, sets and crew.  It's what our out-of-pocket costs will be by the end of September. If you’re reading about our campaign you’re likely already a member of the choir. But if you’ve wandered off in recent years, maybe you’re here because you remembered that  good live theater is like food and without it we are culturally starved. Welcome back and thanks for your support! 
  “The Specials” is about the accidental meeting of two very different couples set in a contemporary American landscape. 


Tom and Diane, two bickering academics on a cross-country road trip, experience car trouble in an unfamiliar suburb far from home. They are rescued by Ivan, an elite military veteran, and Ruth, his young, ex-stripper wife. So begins an uncomfortable encounter that becomes ever more unpredictable as boundaries are broken and new identities emerge.  
“It’s a passionate story about the splitting of the American soul,” Producer David Pilot says.  “It’s about a ritual of healing and confrontation.”

<p>일년 전 처음 런던에 왔을 때, 모든 것이 낯설고
두려웠습니다. 사람들은 알아들을 수 없는 말을 하는 외계인 같았고, 길을 건너는 일, 물 한병 사
마시는 일도 내게 새로운 도전이었습니다. </p>
<p>그렇게 영어 한마디 하는 것조차 두렵고 무서웠던 한국인 유학생으로, 저는  스물 네 명의 사람들과 첫 프로덕션을 만들었습니다. 영국 친구들은
기적을 만들고 있다고 얘기합니다. </p>
<p>이 뮤지컬은 ‘나의 이야기’ 입니다. 한 명의 한국인으로, 공연 예술인으로, 런던의 이방인으로
보고 느낀 것들을 지난 육개월 동안 영국인 작가, 크리스와 함께 써나간, 저의 이야기
입니다. 그리고 이것은 ‘우리 이야기’ 입니다. 서울이라는 도시가
그러하듯이 런던도 많은 문제점들을 감추고 아무렇지도 않은 척 하고 있다는 것을 크리스를 통해 배웠고, 그런 점에서, 나라나 국적, 문화와 상관
없이 우리 모두는 비슷할지 모른다는 생각이 들었습니다. </p>
<p>적절한 페이도 받지 못하고 전 스탭들, 배우들은 모든
에너지, 재능과 시간을 이 프로젝트에 쏟아붓고 있습니다. 그 덕분에영국의 가디언, 캠든 뉴 저널
그리고 캠든 메이어가 180개 캠든 프린지 페스티벌 작품 중 대표작으로 저희 작품을 대표작으로 추천하기도 했습니다. </p>
<p>이 이야기는 결코 한 번에 끝나지 않을 것입니다. 작품 속 유미가
런던에서 고군분투 하는 모습에서 조금씩 조금씩 발전해 나가고 플랫 메이트들의 영웅이 되어 가는 모습처럼, 이 작품도 시간을
두고, 다듬고 고쳐서 더욱 더 노력하고 발전 시키고 싶습니다. </p>
<p>여러분이 도와주신다면 그렇게 어려운 일만도 아니라고 생각합니다. ‘코리안 좀비
뮤지컬’이라는 부제에 이렇게 많은 사람들이 관심을 갖는 다는 사실은 우리 작품에 많은 잠재력이 있다는 것을 보여준다고 자신합니다. </p>
<p>열심히, 최선을 다하겠습니다. 에딘버러 페스티벌에도
출품하고 그리고 언젠가는 웨스트 엔드에도 가고 싶습니다! 도와주세요!!!</p></span></div>","＊Korean version is below the English version.＊

MyFirstMusical Production is the fruit of a company of the people who have completely different background in terms of nationality, culture and field. Everyone working on it has never made a musical before. We are professional in own fields (writing, music, dance, design, etc.), but hasn't actually put a musical, so the piece we are making is truly new and unique.
 
Budget Breakdown
This is non-profit production and the producers invest their own money into the production to create new musical piece in London. All members of crew including creative team, actors, production team are working for same aim without getting any salaries. While, we still need your support to develop the show. Our fundraising goal is £1500, not a huge amount of money, but it does means a lot to us. We do appreciate your help!
We need your support to develop the show especially for the physical production, which is stage set, costume, props and SFX, and the transportation fee for the actors and crew. It is the majority of the budget.

일년 전 처음 런던에 왔을 때, 모든 것이 낯설고
두려웠습니다. 사람들은 알아들을 수 없는 말을 하는 외계인 같았고, 길을 건너는 일, 물 한병 사
마시는 일도 내게 새로운 도전이었습니다. 
그렇게 영어 한마디 하는 것조차 두렵고 무서웠던 한국인 유학생으로, 저는  스물 네 명의 사람들과 첫 프로덕션을 만들었습니다. 영국 친구들은
기적을 만들고 있다고 얘기합니다. 
이 뮤지컬은 ‘나의 이야기’ 입니다. 한 명의 한국인으로, 공연 예술인으로, 런던의 이방인으로
보고 느낀 것들을 지난 육개월 동안 영국인 작가, 크리스와 함께 써나간, 저의 이야기
입니다. 그리고 이것은 ‘우리 이야기’ 입니다. 서울이라는 도시가
그러하듯이 런던도 많은 문제점들을 감추고 아무렇지도 않은 척 하고 있다는 것을 크리스를 통해 배웠고, 그런 점에서, 나라나 국적, 문화와 상관
없이 우리 모두는 비슷할지 모른다는 생각이 들었습니다. 
적절한 페이도 받지 못하고 전 스탭들, 배우들은 모든
에너지, 재능과 시간을 이 프로젝트에 쏟아붓고 있습니다. 그 덕분에영국의 가디언, 캠든 뉴 저널
그리고 캠든 메이어가 180개 캠든 프린지 페스티벌 작품 중 대표작으로 저희 작품을 대표작으로 추천하기도 했습니다. 
이 이야기는 결코 한 번에 끝나지 않을 것입니다. 작품 속 유미가
런던에서 고군분투 하는 모습에서 조금씩 조금씩 발전해 나가고 플랫 메이트들의 영웅이 되어 가는 모습처럼, 이 작품도 시간을
두고, 다듬고 고쳐서 더욱 더 노력하고 발전 시키고 싶습니다. 
여러분이 도와주신다면 그렇게 어려운 일만도 아니라고 생각합니다. ‘코리안 좀비
뮤지컬’이라는 부제에 이렇게 많은 사람들이 관심을 갖는 다는 사실은 우리 작품에 많은 잠재력이 있다는 것을 보여준다고 자신합니다. 
열심히, 최선을 다하겠습니다. 에딘버러 페스티벌에도
출품하고 그리고 언젠가는 웨스트 엔드에도 가고 싶습니다! 도와주세요!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

SPANDEX is an ensemble-devised play that investigates the image of the American Superhero through the eyes of young children.

As young children present a project on their ideal superhero, a group of adult characters are desperately debating the fate of a young man convicted of killing a police officer. SPANDEX explores the notion that superhero stories are often not far from our own as a nation dedicated to justice. The question is...is there anyone really there to save us?</div>

<p><u><strong>Who am I?</strong></u></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Omar Forrest. I am a Bard college graduate who has been involved in theatre since I was four or five years old. I have acted in everything from Shakespeare to the BFG. In high school, I fell in love with the ability to build worlds and tell stories and have been writing and directing ever since. Theatre is a truly vast art form in which we start with an empty stage and mold it into a dream, an art form that can change the very fabric of how physics works.  Despite the limitless possibility that is theater, we creators find ways of constraining ourselves to a single perspective art form in which the audience is looking through a window at actors who are standing before them. We put these artificial start and stop times on the experience as if the whole world of the show was created as the audience sat and destroyed when they stood.</p>
<p>It’s time to throw off these chains!</p>
<p>We live in a world where Amazon, Facebook, Uber, and the web in general, allows us to sit in one place and interact with the world at large in a way that generations before us could never have dreamed possible. If theatre is meant to be the voice of the day, why does it feel a need to limit itself to what is physically in the space the theatre?  It can… no, must learn to use the technology that the rest of the world is using and view the very notion of space in the way that its audience views it if it ever wants to be relevant in the modern world!</p>
<p><u><strong>How YOU Can Help!</strong></u></p>
<p>For this project to work, we need your help. We call on you to do two tasks:</p>
<p>1) In mid-November we will begin asking you if murder can ever be justified. It is your answer to this question that will influence the end of the play. Yes, you read that right. The actual scripting of the play will change according to your votes! The play’s experience need not wait until curtain to begin we invite, need, you to BE A PART of the creative process.</p>
<p>2) We also need your donations to make the show run.  We need to buy costumes, props, and set pieces as well as pay our actors. It is far too often the actor is not paid or that he must put up with less than adequate pay. The actors of this show need to be compensated for their time.  To make the show run smoothly we need $1500. Every dollar matters</p>
<p>Also, remember what I said about that vote? If you donate 20 or more, you will get an extra vote. What is the difference between a politician and a merchant really?</p>
<p>100 or more gets you a recorded video of the show. A multi media live show about technology made not live the use of technology, what more could you want?</p>
<p>Those lucky few who donate $200 or more will get the option to have coffee with the show’s creator and ask him any questions about the show that are on your mind.</p>
<p><u><strong>What Stands in Our Way</strong></u></p>
<p>Any theater production is hard to pull off, but I am confident in my experience and skills that with proper funding this The Dialogue will be a success. Through Northwest High School, Bard College and The Hamlet Project I have gained experience directing from Shakespeare to modern to just straight up bizarre shows </p>
<p>The main obstacle at the moment is the cost of props and recording equipment. this show uses a lot of recordings and this equipment is anything but cheap. We also need to pay to rent a space during tech week but with your help, we can make this a reality.</p>
<p><u><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></u></p>
<p>If you can't contribute, we understand. However, please share this campaign with your friends and family. The more people we reach, the closer we will get to our goal. Every little bit helps.</p>
<p>We need your help to show what the modern theater could be. We need your support to show how the modern theater could interact with people on their terms. We need your generosity to make our show a reality.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you at the performance!</p>

<h3>Who is Saint Fortune, and what is ""One Small Step""?</h3>
<p>We are a group of collaboratively-minded artists devoted to new forms of performance practice created through radical collective creativity. We seek to dissolve the boundaries between reality and performance by creating bold and unconventional performances that encourage new ways of looking, listening, and experiencing the world around us.</p>
<p>""One Small Step"" is our latest adventure and will be landing at the New Ohio Theater on July 4th! An auspicious date for an ambitious show! What's more, NEXT YEAR is the 50th Anniversary of Apollo 11! July 20th, 2019.</p>
<p>The piece is created by a team of actors, directors, designers, dancers, writers and musicians. It is a hallmark of our ensemble that no one person specializes or does one thing; we all share inspirations and create together because we believe that the best ideas emerge when one is allowed to explore outside of their comfort zone and challenge themselves. This piece is created by Gavin Price, John Gasper, Natalie Mack, Emily Pacilio, Emily Craver and Jack Frederick, with costumes by Parron Allen and lights by Evan Anderson.</p>
<p>This show first appeared at La Mama's Sound Departures in January 2017 as an audiovisual exploration of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing. We were fascinated with the level of ambition, technology and risk that it took to complete this famous journey, and were also curious as to what might have happened had the mission gone completely wrong. As we did more research and learned about the moon hoaxes of the 19th century, and took a deep dive into the physics and metaphysics of inter-dimensional realities, we emerged with a show that uses performance as time-travel in an effort to tell a story about what could've happened had Neil, Buzz and Michael Collins entered an alternate reality from the one we all know too well.</p>
<p>We performed a version at the Bushwick Starr for Elevator Repair Service's ""No Great Society and Friends"" in June 2017, took the show on the road to the No Theme Festival in Poughkeepsie, NY, in October 2017, and were then curated by ERS to perform at this season's 25th Anniversary of New Ohio's Ice Factory Festival! Ice Factory has served as the launchpad for many of downtown theater's most restless innovators, and we are honored and humbled to present this work at a festival with such a rich and experimentally-focused history.</p>
<p>With this campaign, we hope to raise the funds that will allow us to pay our collaborators for their awesome work, rent the rehearsal space necessary to create live performance, and realize an immersive audiovisual design that will utilize live video feeds, audio and visual synthesizers, avant-garde dance, and light shining through buckets of water.</p>
<p>This is Saint Fortune's most ambitious project yet, and we can't do it without your help!</p>

</div><div> <p> </p>Anything worth doing comes with an array of risks and challenges. If we are unable to fully fund FLWRS in Los Angeles we will have to work within the budgetary constraints - create something on a much smaller scale, and keep it local (no NY). We would also have to post pone the May premier to a later date - due to venue costs. </div><div>However, if we DO raise the funds (which we WILL!), we have much to plan in a short span of time. It will be a great deal of work, but worth every minute and every dollar. We will need to secure rehearsal space in Los Angeles and New York, officially book and promote our performances, finish CREATING the hour-long, interactive performance, and get people in the seats!

Risks & Challenges


  Anything worth doing comes with an array of risks and challenges. If we are unable to fully fund FLWRS in Los Angeles we will have to work within the budgetary constraints - create something on a much smaller scale, and keep it local (no NY). We would also have to post pone the May premier to a later date - due to venue costs. However, if we DO raise the funds (which we WILL!), we have much to plan in a short span of time. It will be a great deal of work, but worth every minute and every dollar. We will need to secure rehearsal space in Los Angeles and New York, officially book and promote our performances, finish CREATING the hour-long, interactive performance, and get people in the seats! My cast, collaborators, and I are committed to szalt, and have faith that we can soon become a sustainable entity the more we share with the world.

<h3>Season 2016: FAVORITES!</h3> <p>This season marks an exciting new adventure for Anthem Theatre Company. We have been chosen as a Boston Center for the Arts' new Resident Performing Arts Company, or ""ResCo""! This wonderful opportunity provides us with mentorship from established Boston companies and artists, help with marketing, and discounted performance space for the next three years! We are honored to be a part of such a prestigious group, and have worked hard in and out of the theatre for the last few years to get here. </p>
<p>In order to make our mark as a ResCo, Anthem Theatre Company has decided Season 2016 should be spent sharing some of our favorite works with Boston, in our aptly titled SEASON 2016: FAVORITES! </p>
<p>THE DARE PROJECT: BOSTON, September 15-17, 2016--Anthem introduces New York's ""The Dare Project"" to Boston Center for the Arts. This ten-minute play festival, co-created by Bryn Boice with taxdeductible theatre company in 2006, is a unique way to engage our growing Boston audience; seven playwrights are DARED to write plays based on audience suggestions. Beloved companies Zeitgeist Stage Company, Office of War Information (Bureau of Theatre) and Moonbox Productions, among others, will participate.</p>
<p>12TH NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD by Brian MacInnis Smallwood, October 27-November 5, 2016--Anthem presents a campy, bloody, gory, romantic Shakespearean comedy just in time for Halloween. This trip to Illyria follows the plot of Twelfth Night until, quite literally, all hell breaks loose. Bryn and Mike are still laughing about the production they saw in the East Village nine years ago, so it definitely belongs in our season of FAVORITES. Featuring a cast of 15 Boston artists, including Johnny Kinsman as Sir Toby Belch, and Bryn Boice as our fearless, blood-soaked director, this twist on a classic is bound to go down in Boston history as the best Halloween adventure ever.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Anthem Theatre Company's last fundraising campaign in 2013 had incredible impact.

People who are new-to-theatre or theatre-skeptics absolutely love this project because it's fresh, it's new, and you have the chance to commission a play based on an idea in your head! Audiences from each of the ResCos will join us, and we will introduce ourselves to each others' fans, creating a larger web of art seekers and an expanded audience. This new venture is in tune with our mission and can have an impact on all seven small companies. This kind of good will is priceless, as we believe theatre is not a competitive sport, but an art form to be shared.</li>
<li>12TH NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is more than a catchy title, it's a holiday show.

</div><p></p><h3>A Brief Play Synopsis</h3><p>     </p>     Five bottles of centuries old wine are unearthed in a forgotten Paris cellar, wine believed to have been owned by...Thomas Jefferson. This amazing discovery pulls together a cast of disparate characters in a web of comedic intrigue. Denise LeMay, down-on-her-luck adjunct professor, finds herself drawn into the shadowy world of enigmatic Russian wine dealer Rudy Karpov and his scheme to sell the bottles to billionaire energy magnate Arthur Drake. Meanwhile, Ron Johnson, loyal but conflicted agent of the NSA, is assigned, for reasons of national security, to investigate the impending sale by his monomaniacal bureau chief, Connor Bix. As Johnson gets closer to Denise, he becomes more and more uneasy with the NSA’s methods of dragnet data surveillance. Equal parts political satire, espionage thriller, and raucous black comedy, <i>The Jefferson Bottles </i>will have you laughing while pondering the delicate balance between individual privacy and national security.<br/><br/><br/><b>OUR MISSION</b><br/><br/><p>Why is Block St Theatre Co taking on the challenge of producing <i>The Jefferson Bottles</i>? First and foremost because we love this play. Several of us have worked with Todd on developing new work before, and this play is a great example of what makes it so compelling. With a unique voice and a deft comic sensibility, he’s demonstrated an uncanny ability to write plays that are both thought provoking and funny. This is the type of material that actors love taking on.</p><p>We’re also doing it because <i>The Jefferson Bottles</i> is play that needs to be performed now. Not in ten years, not in five years, but now. The issues of individual privacy versus national security have never felt more urgent or more relevant than they do in this moment. And, hey, we love the classics, but there’s just something about producing the world premier of a new play. It generates a special kind of excitement that we know the audience will feel as well.</p><p>We’re doing it because we love showcasing all the theatre talent—writing, directing, acting, and designing—that resides right here in Fayetteville. That’s why we’re calling ourselves Block St Theatre Co. Not because there’s a physical performance space on Block Street--there’s not.  It’s because we’re all affiliated with the University of Arkansas in some way, but we’re also residents of Fayetteville.

</div></div>","A Brief Play Synopsis          Five bottles of centuries old wine are unearthed in a forgotten Paris cellar, wine believed to have been owned by...Thomas Jefferson. This amazing discovery pulls together a cast of disparate characters in a web of comedic intrigue. Denise LeMay, down-on-her-luck adjunct professor, finds herself drawn into the shadowy world of enigmatic Russian wine dealer Rudy Karpov and his scheme to sell the bottles to billionaire energy magnate Arthur Drake. Meanwhile, Ron Johnson, loyal but conflicted agent of the NSA, is assigned, for reasons of national security, to investigate the impending sale by his monomaniacal bureau chief, Connor Bix. As Johnson gets closer to Denise, he becomes more and more uneasy with the NSA’s methods of dragnet data surveillance. Equal parts political satire, espionage thriller, and raucous black comedy, The Jefferson Bottles will have you laughing while pondering the delicate balance between individual privacy and national security.OUR MISSIONWhy is Block St Theatre Co taking on the challenge of producing The Jefferson Bottles? First and foremost because we love this play. Several of us have worked with Todd on developing new work before, and this play is a great example of what makes it so compelling. With a unique voice and a deft comic sensibility, he’s demonstrated an uncanny ability to write plays that are both thought provoking and funny. This is the type of material that actors love taking on.We’re also doing it because The Jefferson Bottles is play that needs to be performed now. Not in ten years, not in five years, but now. The issues of individual privacy versus national security have never felt more urgent or more relevant than they do in this moment. And, hey, we love the classics, but there’s just something about producing the world premier of a new play. It generates a special kind of excitement that we know the audience will feel as well.We’re doing it because we love showcasing all the theatre talent—writing, directing, acting, and designing—that resides right here in Fayetteville. That’s why we’re calling ourselves Block St Theatre Co. Not because there’s a physical performance space on Block Street--there’s not.  It’s because we’re all affiliated with the University of Arkansas in some way, but we’re also residents of Fayetteville. Block Street represents the metaphorical heart of a city we love calling home, and this performance represents a way to strengthen the theatre ties between Fayetteville and the UofA.Our goal of $2,500 represents the bare minimum at which the play can be produced at a professional level. Anything donated above that amount will go to the Humane Society of the Ozarks, located right here in Fayetteville. There are some great perks at each donation level, and you’ll feel good knowing you’re supporting both the development of an exciting new play and the growth of local theatre artists.Take a look, Northwest Arkansas, at some of the talent we’ve assembled:Jason Shipman (director) is a recent graduate of the UofA’s MFA program and a veteran of regional professional theatres including The Warehouse Theatre, Cortland Repertory Theatre, and TheatreSquared.Bill Rogers (actor) will be easily recognizable to area play-goers as a long-time fixture of the local theatre scene.

<p>Hello! My name is Sabina Petra, and I am an actor, singer, composer and writer based in New York City. I've been writing since my graduation musical in kindergarten, but I've finally written my first fully original new musical. It's called MERCURY, about the courageous Jerrie Cobb, who wanted to join the Mercury Space Program in the late 1950s. She got denied because she was a lady, but the extremely shy Jerrie stood up for herself and took her appeal to Congress.</p>
<p>I learned about Jerrie by actually portraying her in an episode of ID Discovery's Mysteries at the Museum. Being an outspoken space-enthusiast myself, I immediately connected with her. I've always been composing separate tracks but this is the first time someone inspired me to write a complete musical story. Her life has been full of courage and a determination to fulfill her dreams - her destiny. With this show, I would like to honor the intense inner struggle she had to face to be able to do so.</p>
<p>The musical is in its final stages of being created. I would love to fund a much needed workshop, which will give the actors, my director Tracy Michailidis (successful actor and director in both the USA and Canada) and our musical director Wiley DeWeese (currently working on the Bob Dylan musical at the Public Theater in New York) and me the opportunity to see the show on its feet and make its final alterations before giving two public readings in New York City on November 12th and 14th. After those readings, we are applying to several festivals, so that we can get the whole musical officially on the launching pad.</p>
<p>The funds will go towards fairly paying the actors, director, musical director, stage manager and venue. It will go towards the studio we will rehearse in, the scripts, scores and re-writes that will have to be printed out and the time and effort that we have to put into the PR (invites, playbills, save-the-dates, video campaigns) for the show - to make sure the right people come see it so Mercury will continue to throttle on - hopefully to the great white (milky) way!</p>
<p>When you contribute you will be able to come and see us perform at Cornelia Street Cafe on November 12 or 14. There will be a ticket waiting for you at the door!</p>
<p>This show is of immense importance to me. Apart from the great message that Jerrie can teach us in this day and age, her personal will-power, curiosity and heart for the great beyond has sparked a fire in me which I would love to pass on to the audience. Also, this show is told in such a different way. It is not your average biography - it doesn't sound like you're listening to a WikiPedia page set to music. It's about her clashing beliefs: the scientist, the activist, the believer and the astronaut all struggling for foothold within her mind. I cannot wait to share this story with you.</p>
<p>Our only challenge is the funding. Casting, musical direction, direction, planning, outline, future structures...everything is accounted for. All we need is your financial support and we can do it. Bring it to Broadway!</p>
<p>Please share our story with everyone! The whole world needs to hear about Jerrie Cobb!</p>

<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>The Maine Playwrights Festival has been a consistent part of the state's cultural landscape for the past 16 years.  Every year, we inspire dozens of playwrights to write, polish, and submit new plays, and those that are selected receive extensive opportunities to revise their piece with the help of MPF Artistic Director Daniel Burson and our Playwright-in-Residence.  We also hold open auditions for the festival, introducing new actors into the community each year.  Your donation helps Acorn Productions, the MPF's producer, ensure that this annual event is financially stable so that we can continue to offer this unique opportunity to Maine-based theater artists.</p>

Our $2,500 indiegogo campaign goal bridges the gap between our anticipated expenses and projected ticket sales and sponsorship revenue. This funding will be divided among all the essential aspects of the Maine Playwrights Festival: publicity, technical staff, tech materials (such as costumes, props, paint, lighting gel, and glowtape for backstage safety), and most important compensating the actors and directors bringing these 6 brand new plays to life!

<p>If you’re one of the thousands of audience members who has attended a GCRep show, you KNOW that our hallmarks are high energy, unique physicality, and dynamic, powerful, impactful content. We aim to keep y’all on the edge of your seats! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551475591/bmxgh40ce7gp0dcmw9nn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Gritty City Repertory Youth Theatre is Oakland's rigorous, pre-professional theatrical training program for youth of color. GCRep inspires young adults to risk and explore, developing their leadership, confidence, and compassion for the human family through the production of powerful theatre. We take artistic risks. We do not shy away from difficult subject matter. Our work is both relevant and accessible. By creating a welcoming and safe space for youth and communities of color to experience and process profound and impactful theatre, GCRep is engaging a new and diverse generation of theatre-goers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551475835/un0pixoqf9t10n9qxkcp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have been performing live theatre in Oakland with an ensemble of youth of color from Oakland public schools for the last 7 years. Every year our audience grows, our budget grows, our programming grows, but our training for youth performers stays 100% free and our ticket prices stay low. Know why? This is theatre by and for the community, and that means no one is turned away for lack of funds. </p>
<p>Here’s what folks have been saying about the last four GCRep shows:</p>

<p>“I haven’t been able to stop talking about this play since I saw it last week.

<p style=""""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"">Coming up on its second anniversary, Spark is thrilled to present its first full-length evening work. The work will be given two presentations - Friday and Saturday, April 13th and14th, 2012 - at University Settlement's Speyer Hall in New York City's Lower East Side. </span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"">This exciting evening titled ""Push to Play,"" is composed of two diverse concepts. The first half of the evening explores the many ""games"" that we experience in the world of dating. Using interviews with friends of Spark, Artistic Director and choreographer Chelsea Koenig weaves together the familiar and, at times, not-so-comfortable ""comedy"" of romance. The second is a compilation of collaborations with local musicians and artists.</span></p>

Founded in 2009 with a mission to create an accessible dance experience, Spark Movement Collective (Spark) has quickly established itself through its ability to impact the New York City community with site-specific work and through in-house performances. 
Coming up on its second anniversary, Spark is thrilled to present its first full-length evening work. The work will be given two presentations - Friday and Saturday, April 13th and14th, 2012 - at University Settlement's Speyer Hall in New York City's Lower East Side. 
This exciting evening titled ""Push to Play,"" is composed of two diverse concepts. The first half of the evening explores the many ""games"" that we experience in the world of dating. Using interviews with friends of Spark, Artistic Director and choreographer Chelsea Koenig weaves together the familiar and, at times, not-so-comfortable ""comedy"" of romance. The second is a compilation of collaborations with local musicians and artists.
 
The Impact


Like the performance it supports, this campaign is divided into two phases. The first phase is allocated to the performance space, while the second phase will contribute to various production costs. We have achieved our first phase and are now working towards our second phase!


What We Need & What You Get
Spark is supported through a variety of funding sources, including, but not limited to, special events, an annual giving campaign, and in-kind donations. All funds raised through this campaign will go directly to the outlined presentation, as well as to the continuation of Spark's mission.

<p><strong>The Joy of Dancing!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hello,</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for visiting our page and reading about us!</p>
<p>We are dedicated to providing and influencing our children with art through ballet dancing. We need your help and support.</p>
<p>Our students range in age from 4 to 11 years old.</p>
<p>We believe that providing ballet to our children is essential for the development of their character, personality, manners, grace, discipline, charm, poise, musicality, elegance and performance skills.</p>
<p>My name is Juneta Ozolina. I was born in the city of Riga, capital of a small country, Latvia, in Europe.</p>
<p>I've been a professional ballet dancer since age 5. I graduated from the prestigious Riga Academy of Ballet, from where the most famous ballet dancers have graduated as well: Mikhail Baryshnikov, Alexander Godunov, John Markovsky, and Maris Liepa, to name a few.</p>
<p>I had professionally performed for over 25 years the world's famous and prestigious Giselle, The Nutcracker, Kosar, Don Quixote and Swan Lake; in Sweden, Norway, Italy, Germany, USA, Latvia, Russia, Denmark and Israel.</p>
<p>We opened the first ballet school for children in our community 1+ year ago. Since then, we were able to develop our ballerinas in such way, that we had our first production last June of 2012, called ""Voices of Spring"", which you can watch in 4 different videos, in our official channel in youtube.com. We trained these beautiful children from scratch to stage, in 6 months only. Please visit our links below.</p>
<p>As we grew into teaching in 2 elementary schools, both school stages are too small for this perfomance. Our dream is to perform our production on a larger professional stage.</p>
<p>Now, I'm ready to lead these ballerinas to a higher level of ballet performance: Swan Lake; and at a professional large theater stage.</p>
<p>Your support will impact all these little ballerinas that dedicate their time and their love to dancing ballet. It will be one of the most remarkable memories in their lifetime.</p>
<p>Our production is set for April 11th 2013, at the Pepperdine University in Malibu, and it's FREE ENTRANCE event for everyone.</p>
<p>We want to set a remarkable milestone and create beautiful memories; and I need your help.</p>
<p>We will be very thankful to you, forever!</p>

</h3><h3>About JEWISH THEATRE ENSEMBLE:</h3><p></p><p>The Jewish Theatre Ensemble (JTE) was founded in 1995 by a group of five students who were intent on expanding the university's student-theatre community by producing plays and musicals involving Jewish themes. Since its first season, JTE has presented over fifty of these productions to students at Northwestern as well as members of the Evanston community. In addition to producing work by established playwrights, JTE is committed to the creation and development of new plays and in the past has sponsored a playwriting festival for aspiring writers at Northwestern. And you do not need to be Jewish to be involved! <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Jewish Theatre Ensemble exists to provide the Northwestern community with high quality entertainment and exposure to Jewish involvement in the arts. The organization aspires to challenge common perceptions and generate conversation relating to issues that fall within the resonance of the Jewish experience through artistic media with particular relevance to the Northwestern community.

In order to do this, The Jewish Theatre Ensemble will operate at a level of artistic excellence as well as encourage and support creative endeavors that promote Jewish themes in the arts.</span></p><p></p><h3>The Show:</h3>NEXT TO NORMAL is a poignant show about a family shattered by loss.

<p>Hi!  My name is Eli Skelton and I love to dance.  I am also gymnast, wrestler and a straight “A” student.   My parents took me to see “ Singin’ in the Rain” when I was six years old and I knew right then that I was born to dance.  I’m seventeen years old now, and it’s time for me to take the next step and go to a professional development program.  I’ve been accepted into the Summer Intensive Dance Program with the Texas Ballet Theater, but the program is expensive. The program runs from June 17- July 19 with a performance at the end.  I have a part time job and I’ve been saving up money to go but will still need help.</p>
<p>The program will cost $4275 which covers the classes, housing and food. Donations of any amount  are welcome and much appreciated!  All donors will receive an email expressing my appreciation with an attached photograph taken during the program.  Donations fifty dollars or more will receive a personal letter of thanks with a photograph  and a description of what  I’ve learned at the program.</p>
<p>My experiences in dance so far have taught me that the Arts are our best hope for bringing people together.  I have met dancers from all over the world, and no matter how different our backgrounds have been, we are all united in the love of ballet.  I believe that this makes a popular support for the Arts of key importance to the creation of a healthy world community.  And…I love to dance!</p>
<p>If you’d care to contribute to my campaign, even if all you can do is pass my request on to friends and family, you’ll have my gratitude.  If you choose to pass my campaign information along, be sure to use the Indiegogo share tools attached to this site!  Thank you for taking the time to read about my campaign!  </p>

<p>Hi! I'm Rik Deskin, an Actor/Comedian and the Artistic Director of Eclectic Theater Company (ETC). That's me above hosting one of our weekly shows, The Comedy Workshop. ETC is the Resident Company at Odd Duck Studio, a 49-seat black-box theater located right on the border of First Hill and Capitol Hill in Seattle. As Artistic Director, I've curated nearly 6 years of Classic, Contemporary, Original work for the Stage and Screen in the form of Plays, Improv, Stand-Up &amp; Sketch Comedy as well as Play Readings and Screenplay Readings of new work in development and location and general production support for independent films. I want to continue to bring innovative, interesting programming to Seattle audiences and need sustained support for operational costs such as rent, utilities and insurance.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Continuing a sustainable operation provides an affordable theater to itinerant Theatre Artists and Groups that might have a difficult time finding an accessible space for their projects. Some of our programming is free for audience members that might not be able to attend a show due to their own economic situation. If we don't succeed in raising the needed funds to continue, then Seattle might lose a theater venue that has a rich history dating back to 1997, where new, alternative work is created amidst many adaptations of classic and contemporary works. No other venue in Seattle generates the amount of original work year-round that we curate.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $5050 that will go directly to paying our rent, and enabling us a little cushion as we generate box office and rental revenue from pending projects. For helping us, we have perks that range from show tickets to being able to produce your own show. For every dollar you contribute, you will get value that equals and surpasses your support.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Please join me by sharing this campaign with people you know can help. Even if you can't contribute, sharing with others and spreading the word will help!</p>

<h3>WE ARE GOING TO AACT FEST 2013!</h3>
<p>Dakota Fine Arts Consortium's production of Ken Ludwig's <em>Leading Ladies</em> has been chosen as one of the 12 best plays across the United States! We are honored to be representing Region V at the American Association of Community Theatre's National Festival! This is DFAC's first trip to National's and we could not be more thrilled, BUT...</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>WE NEED YOUR HELP!</h3>
<p align=""left"">DFAC is itself a homeless theater, a volunteer organization with a small membership, and a limited budget. We continue to use rented, borrowed or donated space for performances, rehearsals, storage, and construction.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Fundraising will cover:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Transportation and Gas</strong>. (We need to get 8 actors, 7 crew members, a large box set, around 50 costumes, and 7 wigs, to Carmel, IN, which is about 1,200 miles round trip!)</li>
<li>
<strong>Hotel rooms for our cast and crew for 6 nights</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Festival Registration for cast and crew</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>A few things to remember:</h3>
<p>We are a cast and crew of volunteers, all of the money we are looking to raise is going towards expenses for this show.</p>
<p>and</p>

</div></div>","WE ARE GOING TO AACT FEST 2013!
Dakota Fine Arts Consortium's production of Ken Ludwig's Leading Ladies has been chosen as one of the 12 best plays across the United States! We are honored to be representing Region V at the American Association of Community Theatre's National Festival! This is DFAC's first trip to National's and we could not be more thrilled, BUT...


WE NEED YOUR HELP!
DFAC is itself a homeless theater, a volunteer organization with a small membership, and a limited budget. We continue to use rented, borrowed or donated space for performances, rehearsals, storage, and construction.
Our Fundraising will cover:


Transportation and Gas. (We need to get 8 actors, 7 crew members, a large box set, around 50 costumes, and 7 wigs, to Carmel, IN, which is about 1,200 miles round trip!)

Hotel rooms for our cast and crew for 6 nights.

Festival Registration for cast and crew.



A few things to remember:
We are a cast and crew of volunteers, all of the money we are looking to raise is going towards expenses for this show.
and
DFAC is a non-profit theatre organization, so all payments go through FirstGiving, who will send you a tax-deductible receipt for your contribution! 
one more thing...
We actually need to raise $7,200 for all of the expenses, but decided to start out with a more reasonable $5,000. So don't worry, if we are able to exceed our $5,000 goal, anything over that will still be going towards the festival expenses!

<li>Stipends for the demo recording. ($2,500)</li>
<li>Recording studio fees. ($1,000)</li>
</ul>

Having successfully produced our show, ""Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, A Musical"" at the 2011 New York Musical Theatre Festival (WINNER: Most Promising Musical) and other demo recordings of our work, we know what it takes to develop and promote a new work. We also know how important it is to spend money wisely.
Our total budget for both the reading and the demo recording is $10,000 which includes:

Stipends for our director, musical director, stage management and actors. ($2,200)
Rental fees for the rehearsal and presentation studios. ($1,500)
Printing of scripts and scores and administrative costs. ($800)
Writer transportation and housing -- we don't live in NYC and need a place to sleep! ($2,000)
Stipends for the demo recording. ($2,500)
Recording studio fees. ($1,000)

We are happy to offer a variety of perks for those who help us reach our goal, including:

Acknowledgement on the LILY Facebook page.
Your name included in the presentation program.
A copy of the newly recorded demo.
A signed copy of the presentation program.
A special invitation to attend the presentation and a special personal acknowledgement before the reading begins.
Tea with the writers.
For everyone, we will send email updates about LILY as it continues to develop.



The Impact
Every little bit helps; no amount is too small.
We love creating beautiful work and we will love collaborating with you to bring this new work of art to life.

<p><strong>Kinitiras Studio(<a href=""http://www.kinitirastudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kinitirastudio.com</a>) and Vicky Adamou present the new Project TimeLine! A work written by Christina Sampaniku and 6 guest writers (<a href=""http://timelineproject.gr/?page_id=21"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://timelineproject.gr/?page_id=21</a>)<br/></strong></p>
<p>Kinitiras Studio has presented more than 15 complete production works, has taken part in big events, like Athens 2004, has performed works in Megaro Mousikis, Athens and has represented Greece in well-known festivals abroad. It is the first artistic residency centre in Greece with continuous art projects since 1996 and has cooperated with well known Greek and international artists.</p>
<p>Vicky Adamou after her work ""Foreign Language"" and the online foto romance series ""areyousirius.gr"" which successfully continues until today, presents the performance Timeline,which is based on devised theatre techniques,where the final piece occurs through improvisational techniques and the creative contribution of all the team members. The initial idea by Vicky Adamou aims to look through a peephole the lives of 6 people as they are presented through the social media. The visible and the invisible parts of their lives through this very specific communication form of the social media. The work is written by Christina Sampanikou and the surprise monologues are written by Kostas Giannakidis, Chara Giannakopoulou, Lucretia, Christos Polymenakos, Thanasis Rokanas and Grigoris Kapsalas.</p>

<p><strong>Project TIMELINE description</strong></p>
<p>6 roles taken from the real life, the social media. What? Do you think that social media are not the real life? I guess you are right! They are not; they are more real than life itself, they are the true version of ourselves.</p>
<p>They are the space where you can be free, to reveal whatever the daily conventions try to censor. The space where you can pretend to be what you wish you were and make it believable. We communicate, learn, share, fall in love, make a revolution, psychoanalysis, politics, we advertise our work, we challenge our insecurity, we release ourselves through them.</p>
<p>Social media are a big part of our life. An exploration that unfolds into a work with two parts:</p>
<p>The first part is an online experiment that starts on 11<sup>th</sup> March and develops in front of you, in the screens of your lap tops/pcs with you as participants and observers. 6 imaginative but at the same time totally recognisable characters are born through the social media.  They have a status and they are formed through the social media platforms, giving you at the same time the opportunity to get to know them.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Alison Richards I am a graduated Youth worker and passionate about break dancing (Bboying) as it kept myself a rebel teenager from falling into a bad crowd. I have used my love for Bboying to get thru to dissaffected young people i have come into contact with through my years experiences.</p>
<p>I saw a need in my community as the government made more and more cuts to the youth sector, and started closing clubs, centres cutting funding in disadvantaged areas.Where i live Birmingham is the second biggest city and there is only 1 youth centre in my area.</p>
<p>The young people had no where to go and boredom set in, then they started to entertain themselves in a destructive competitivness leading straight in to crime. I  decided to act as small as it may seem to start a tournament for young and old with a love for breakdancing or dance in general to come together 2-3 times in the year and celebrate what dance had and is doing in our lives and the lives of the children in our community, and make classes and workshops from the celebrities in our field accessable to them.</p>
<p>If you decide to help us today and contribute you will be helping to change the lives confidence and attitudes of many disadvantage kids and young people who want to achieve with Breakdancing and life its self.</p>
<p>these children work hard when training for tournaments and are more than aware of the discipline it takes to become one of the best and they feel a sense of belonging and achievement.</p>
<p>It is important to us because too many young ones are on a path of no return and the juvenile age bracket is getting younger and more frequent in my town.</p>
<p> Please go to our website and look through our gallery and videos so you can see what we do.</p>
<p>Please consider us helping us . Thank you kindly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We would like to raise 15,000 for our campaign but any help is appreciated. We will hosting 3 tournaments for the year one of which is international and based in italy which would allow their qualifying dancers to come to the uk and compete with the uk dancers.</p>
<p> Each tournament costs around £4,500</p>
<p>which makes up of judges fees and flights and accomodation , venue costs,prizes and trophies Deejays and Hosts , and staff etc.</p>
<p>We are giving advertising perks away to those who have donated specific amounts. Including advertising on our facebook, twitter, and official websites, also banners of your brand or company at the events. We do not have much to offer but will kindly do so in appreciation for your help.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our campaign goal the money will still be used towards the event. Depending on how much our campaign raises we may do only 1-2 tournaments.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I feel this project is very important as a whole as it targets a group that if not given acess to outlets for them to enjoy themselves  may very well get themselves into trouble. Also that does not put pressure financially on parents who may not be able to afford weekly activities for their children. It is also a project that is very current with young people right now and major events like Battle of the Year in france and IBE in holland are aims for our young people to aspire to compete at.</p>
<p>We are very experienced in this kind of event organising and your funding would be put to good use and a great cause.</p>
<p>At present we are funding this project out of our own pockets and the faces and comments of the people we reach make it all worth the effort, we only would like to make this project sustainable as we would hate to take it away from them through lack of funding.</p>

Story
Waiting... is the exciting new musical about the life of GG, a young Latino graffiti artist - and his faltering and blooming in the environs of The City of Angels - Los Angeles. The characters of Prof, Grace, Izzy, and Marcus join him for the journey - a week in the lives of these humorous, yet complicated, Angelenos.
With the city of LA mixed into the stew pot (almost like a sixth character) Waiting... is contemporary musical enfusing a cross-pollination of Latin | Jazz | Pop | Rock | Hip Hop music, and lyrics that bite and console all at once - all serving as its musical stroytelling palette and canvas.  

The Production's Story
Back in May 2012, Waiting... had its successful workshop premiere at Boulder's SoFA.  Over the past year, the script, characters, and music & lyrics have undergone exciting and big changes as this story of GG, Prof, Grace, Izzy, and Marcus has focused, expanded, and bloomed.   
Our Story
Composer/Lyricist/Bookwriter* Michael O'Dell - an acomplished musician and music director for a plethora of shows - from NYC to SF to LA, and most recently the Music Director for the 2010/2012 In the Mood National Tour - is once again at the helm, assembling an artistically savy, talented cast, band, and production team for Waiting... to take its next step:  The 2013 Boulder International Fringe Festival this September for 6 performances.  
How YOU Can Become Part of OUR Story
Waiting... is now on the cusp to take this next BIG step but we need your financial help.  Bringing any show to the stage involves setting a specific budget and production goals to help tell the story efficiently and visually. And bringing a new theatrical work like this to the stage requires real money to meet those artistic and production goals.

 
We have set a campaign goal of $5000+ to be reached by September 9, 2013.  If we reach our goal, we get all of the funds (Huzzah!); and if we raise only a portion of our goal, we only receive a portion of the funds.  Please help us meet 100% of our goal.  ALL monies raised go toward paying:


A kick-ass cast (in the form of performance payment & rehearsal stipend)
A smoking hot band (in the form of performance payment & rehearsal stipend)
An amazing (and real life) grafitti artist to help us create slides and animation for our video projections (in the form of a stipend)
Minimal set construction and materials
Our 2013 BIFF entrance fee
Rehearsal space rental fees
Coffee - one must keep artists caffeinated! 
And miscellaneous production fees

Chip in! Become part of the Waiting... team!  This will most defintiely help us meet our financial goal so we can meet our artistic goals.  And if you do, you'll get one of the cool ""PERKS"" (at the right side of this page).


YOU Can Us Help Share the Story of OUR Journey!
Here's where you can find us:

Every little bit of change helps - even small change.  $5, $10.  Even a contribution of $1!  And if you cannot contribute, but would still like to help, spread the word about this show and our journey to The 2013 Boulder International Fringe Festival!

<h3>So, what is it I'm doing?</h3>
<p>My name is Megan Marshall and I am making my way to New York City this summer. I will be interning with both a production/management company and a theatre company. It has always been my goal and dream to work in New York's theatre industry. After I graduate UC's College-Conservatory of Music next year, I will be moving to the city to become a permanent resident. These upcoming internships are wildly important to the start of my career. Working in both a business environment and an artistic environment, I will be acquiring knowledge to help fulfill my life-long goal of creating my own theatre company in New York. This next step in my career-building process is immensely invigorating and a little frightening (in the most exciting way, of course). I would love for you to join me. Through your donations, you become a partner in my artistic journey. Together, I believe we can build something new and exciting to impact the world of theatre.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Logistics:</h3>
<p>Interns are often paid very little for their work. One internship is for school credit and the other will be giving me a $20 travel stipend. Clearly, this will not help me support myself while I'm working in the city. It may seem strange to be working for practically nothing, but as I described before, the experience is invaluable. My expenses will include travel costs, rent and utilities, metrocards, and food. All this comes to around $3,650. My goal for this fundraiser is $1,500 to help lighten that number. But, anything helps! Here's a breakdown of expected costs:</p>
<p>Travel:$400</p>
<p>Rent &amp; Utilities (3 months): $2,500</p>
<p>Metrocards (3 months): $345</p>
<p>Food (3 months): $400</p>
<p>Your contributions are vitally important for me to make this career-enhancing journey. I am endlessly grateful for anything that can be donated. Every little bit helps!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>I cannot express how important this experience is to me and my career. Many of you know me as an actor, but I want to contribute to the theatre world in more ways than that. I believe that theatre has a unique way of reaching out to the eclectic group of people that make up our world... I want to use my aforementioned goal of creating a theatre company to take advantage of that unique communication. I intend to develop a company that focuses on works dealing with violence in today's culture. Not only do I want to produce plays that deal with that subject matter, but I also intend for the company to be heavily involved in community organizations that deal with these issues.</p>
<p>That being said, a girl about to graduate college has to start somewhere to achieve such a large goal. These internships are Step One.</p>
<p>Please donate to help me take this giant leap forward. All donations will go directly to my internship expenses.</p>
<p>If I happen to exceed my goal, I will be donating all extra donations to the local Women Helping Women Center who serve survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Their efforts to promote awareness and to help prevent violent crimes have led me to a working relationship with the organization. I intend on sharing excess donations with them due to their support throughout the beginning of my artistic journey.</p>

We have volunteered with the Mad Student Society, helping them with Hamilton’s very first Mad Pride event, donated to the Mental Health Rights Coalition of Hamilton, the CP24 CHUM Christmas Wish and the Eden Food Bank. This is a tradition we intend to continue and ingrain in the artists that we take on during this project. We are looking to work with SKETCH, a community-arts-development initiative based in Toronto engaging young people homeless and on the margins from across Canada. They create opportunities for them to experience the transformative power of the arts. We are really excited to partner with them on this project.In the eighteen months we have been running we have produced five original pieces of work, four of which were independent productions. The fifth and most recent production ‘A Little Too Close To Home’ won Best of Venue at the 2013 Hamilton Fringe Festival. Our Artistic Director Luke Reece is very well connected in the Theatre Community and we will be utilizing those connections to bring in experienced mentors to help coach our Emerging Artists. What We Need & What You GetWe need to raise $3,270 to help us cover the costs of renting a venue, rehearsal space, set, props, costume, artist fees and marketing. We want to make sure that we can provide our emerging artist with all the resources they need to get their work to the stage. Of course, this means we need a stage.$1,500 will go towards renting the venue$500 will go towards rehearsal space$200 will go towards props, costume and set$400 will go to the performers, designers and selected playwright/director$200 will go towards marketing$200 will go towards charity and community outreach$270 will go towards covering the Indiegogo feesOur contributors will receive a number of unique and exciting perks. There is everything from a free admittance to see the performance, to having your very own website designed for you. Other highlights from our list of perks include being featured on one of our Vlogs, having a song written for you, and an invite to our VIP Company After-Party.If we do not reach our goal then everything that we have raised will still go towards funding the Emerging Artist Project.  We will continue to work hard to ensure that this production is something we’re proud of, something our selected artist is proud of, and something that the young artists of Canada can be proud of.Other Ways You Can HelpSpread the word! If you find yourself on Facebook or Twitter, take a few seconds to retweet us and like or share our posts. The more people know about the Emerging Artist Project, the more support Canada’s young artists can get.If you know of a cheap place to rent rehearsal space, or a charity you think fits with our piece, or any other resources you think we could use, let us know.

<div> </div>
<div>In 2009, I wrote a one person show about love, dance and pop music called Last Dance. This semi autobiographical piece charts Sienna's journey from elementary school til the present as she attempts to understand why her love life is far from stellar.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have done a workshop production in 2010 and now I am ready to produce to mount a full production with lights in a proper theatre. I will be presenting Last Dance in September 2012. It will be directed by Djennie Laguerre and feature composer/accompanist Adam Weinmann and collaborative musician, Etienne Levesque.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>I need about about $3500....</h3>
<p>In order to pay for the theatre, director fees and marketing and publicity, I need about $4500. I plan to raise $1000 through fundraising events and sponsorship, so I need your help to bring it to the next level.</p>

<p>have $2000 to pay my director (Djennie Laguerre!)</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>Your contribution would mean so much to me!</h3>

<p>Opening a show in Vegas is expensive and tough.  Thankfully having worked here the last two years has given me the experience on how to make it.  With the support of the Hotel, great friend&amp;fellow performer Michael Johns, and people anxious to push ticket sales this will be great.  But there are things I need in order to do it right.</p>

It’s a big song with a big effect on people all over the world, so in order to do it justice we’re making our number as big as possible—and booking a season of appearances for it, to boot! But to make it big, we need your help.</p>
<p>We need to raise $3,500 for rehearsal space rental, wigs, costumes, video work and, especially, to pay 10 deeply dedicated performers, who often get nothing for months of work. So we’re asking you, our beloved community, for contributions … and to show our appreciation, we’re offering sneak peeks at rehearsals, visits to our glorious wig-maker’s studio, a cast photo, front-row tickets to our ultimate 2012 performance, and even post-show drinks with the cast. Plus the knowledge that by helping to rehearse, document, wig, costume and pay us, you’re contributing to a joyful, outrageous performance that guarantees you’ll never think of Bohemian Rhapsody the same way again.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>YES, THAT SONG!</h3>
<p>For copyright reasons, we can’t play the song in our video—but you <em>know</em> the song. It’s been sung by rockers, choirs, Muppets and a drunk Canadian who got arrested. And it’s your karaoke song!</p>
<p>You may well ask: What makes you think the world needs another interpretation of this masterpiece? The answer is simple: NOBODY HAS EVER DONE IT LIKE THIS BEFORE.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHAT THE SONG INSPIRED/ WHAT WE'RE DOING</h3>
<p>Equal parts dance piece, lip-sync drag number and live music video. Performed by 10 award-winning professional Austin performers. Wearing specially made, glammed-up 18<sup>th</sup>-century costumes and gigantic pastel wigs. Spouting all the pageantry, pathos, gender-mucking, pomp, circumstance, depravity and bombast we can possibly cram into it! </p>

<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>The New School for Drama is hosting a special, three-performance run of Jose Rivera's play BRAINPEOPLE in collaboration with Mr. Rivera himself, featuring New School alumni alongside other New York professionals.  This'll be the first chance to see BRAINPEOPLE in New York, and we've only got a short time to make it happen.  We need your help!</p>
<p>You can find details about the performances and the cast and crew on our <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/events/189224664531632/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook event page</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's BRAINPEOPLE?</h3>
<p>BRAINPEOPLE is a play by Jose Rivera, about a woman named Mayannah who sends her armored limosine out into a ruined city to pick up two strangers and bring them back to her palatial home for an exotic feast and some deep conversation.  Things get complicated when one of the guests brings along her cadre of ""brainpeople,"" and the meal turns into an evening of brutal honesty and terrifying introspection.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's the money for?</h3>
<p>This IndieGoGo is to help us raise the money to make this production happen.  Everyone involved is doing this for nothing, for a love of the project and a real belief that BRAINPEOPLE is a play people need to see.  But we need the space and the time to make that happen, and your money will go a long way to making this a reality.</p>
<p>The money will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rental of rehearsal space</li>
<li>Props and materials for the set</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Publicity for the show</li>
<li>Other fun fees hidden inside every theatre production (lamp maintenance! transportation!)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What do I get out of it?</h3>
<p>Other than a warm, fuzzy feeling and a contribution to the arts that will echo through the community? We've got perks! You can check 'em out along the side of the page, but they include tickets to the performances, programs, screenplays and scripts signed by Jose Rivera himself, and even a chance to get coffee with the man and ask him the burning questions that anyone might want to ask an Obie Award-winnning playwright and Academy Award-nominated screenwriter.</p>
<h3>What if you exceed your goal?</h3>
<p>Well, the goal for this campaign is just to get us stared: to meet all of our expected costs, we'll need close to $3000.  So money raised above and beyond our goal here will keep getting funnelled into the production, to make it as strong a piece as we possibly can.  Beyond that?  We'll put the money towards better materials for our set and costumes.  And if we raise enough money, we'd love to be able to give a little something back to our cast and crew, to thank them for the monumental effort they're already putting in.</p>
<h3>How else can I help?</h3>
<p>Later in May, we're hoping to have a fundraiser evening where you'll have a chance to bid on some items in a silent auction and hear monologues written by Jose and performed by a member of our wonderful cast.  We'll keep you posted as to when and where that's going to happen.</p>
<p>Beyond that? <em>Spread the word!</em> Tell your friends, tell your families, tell your dog.  Tell your favorite barista.  Tweet us!  Blog about us!  The more people who know about this little project, the more people will be able to experience this remarkable play.</p>
<h3>Who's Jose Rivera?</h3>
<p>Jose is a playwright and screenwriter; he's written around two dozen plays including MARISOL, REFERENCES TO SALVADOR DALI MAKE ME HOT, and MASSACRE (SING TO YOUR CHILDREN), has contributed to half a dozen TV shows (including co-creating EERIE, INDIANA), and has written a bunch of films, including MOTORCYCLE DIARIES (for which he was nominated for an Academy Award, making him the first Puerto Rican-born writer to earn the distinction) and the upcoming ON THE ROAD, based on the novel by Jack Kerouac.  He's won two Obie Awards, a Whiting Writers' Award, and a Fulbright Arts Fellowship, among many other distinctions.</p>
<h3>What's the New School for Drama?</h3>
<p>The New School for Drama is an MFA (Master of Fine Arts) conservatory program that trains actors, playwrights and directors in a three-year program.  The training is rigorous, high-quality, and wide-reaching, with a special focus on collaboration and the creation of new work.  You can check us out <a href=""http://www.newschool.edu/drama/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here.</a></p>

<p>""The Black Seminoles"" is a play that tells the true but little-known story of the Black  Seminole Indians struggle to exist and maintain their freedom in Florida between 1700 and 1842. I am a descendant of William the Conqueror and the Black and Indian Seminole Indians.  I am an author and producer, and the play is adapted from my book ""The Black Seminoles.""  We would like for the play to open this Fall, and we need your support to help make that happen!</p>
<p>The play is dedicated to the thousands of black Seminoles who gave their lives in the pursuit of freedom and liberty. Very few people are even aware that such a people exist, so anyone who gives a donation will be helping us to achieve the monumental task of enlightening the world about this dramatic and important part of our history. The spell-bounding play's five main characters include Abraham, Wildcat, Cudjoe, Osceola and Osceola's wife, who are constantly under the threat of losing their freedom.  One of the most dramatic scenes of the play occurs when Osceola's wife is seized by slave-catchers at Fort King.  The seizing of Osceola's wife commenced the beginning of the Second Seminole War.   </p>
<p> Our initial goal of $25,000.00 covers all the basic logistical expenses of producing a play in Tampa, Florida-- our venue fee and publicity materials,</p>
<p>Any money that we raise here will first cover the cost of our venue, but any further money we raise will go toward the many other cost associated with producing a play, such as our technical needs, publicity materials, and costumes.  </p>
<p>Anyone who gives a donation of any amount will receive thanks on the ""Supporters"" page of our website and anyone who gives $50.00 or more will receive a free book and have their names (or someone they would like to honor) tastefully displayed in the play's program.  Also, anyone who gives $100.00 or more will receive the same perks and an invitation to the opening night of the ""The Black Seminoles."" There are also some great additional perks available for larger donations, such as  DVDs of the play and personal postcards.</p>
<p>We will provide you with our website where we will be posting updates about the play, including the venue and dates and times of the performances.  So, if you're going to be in the Tampa Bay area on those dates, please make sure you come check us out!  Thank you in advance for your support!</p></div>","The Black Seminoles

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Ainsley Hillyard, a dance and theatre artist and I made a show about outer space, with my French bulldog, Jezebel. This is a huge passion project for me as it combines my love of movement, text and, well... my dog. </p>
<p>Show Synopsis:</p>
<p>Obsessed with traveling to the past, an astronaut and her French bulldog, Jezebel, explore the universe attempting to unravel the mysteries of time travel. From distant galaxies full of nonverbal life forms, all the way to Portland, Oregon, the astronaut is desperately searching in an attempt to crack the code. A tale of adventure, heroism, mortality, and love, it is a modern day Turner and Hooch…meets Space Jam…meets Einstein’s theory of relativity.  An interweaving of text, movement, and an untrained French bulldog, each show is a new adventure.</p>
<p>This piece began with a two week creative process with One Yellow Rabbit’s Denise Clarke in Calgary, and questions how we interact with our animal companions, the different relationships we have with them and how much they really mean to us.</p>
<p>Previous performances/iterations: </p>
<p>Feats Festival of Dance, Edmonton AB, July 2017.</p>
<p>UnoFest in Victoria BC, May 2018.</p>
<p>Winnipeg Fringe Festival, Winnipeg MB, July 2018.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is the first time the full length version of this piece will be performed in our home town of Edmonton and Jezebel and I are beyond excited for the production. We are hoping to raise at least $5000 for production and design fees, which will provide the adequate support for the show and the team of artists working on it!</p>
<p>Jezebel, at the Still Point will be running October 11-21, 2018 as part of the Roxy Performance Series presented by Their Network. They offer a multitude of support, but we still need money to help with artist and production fees!</p>
<p>There are some fun perks, all Jezebel oriented of course, to thank you for your contributions!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your support we will be able to incorporate lighting, sound and video design for the piece, which so far has existed on a very small production budget.</p>
<p>Your support also means that a large team of artists will be paid a fee for their work, which otherwise would be volunteered or wouldn't happen at all. There has already been so much unpaid labour on this project, as it is a huge passion and our funding has been limited.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>Why we are fundraising...</h3>
<p>SQUAD dedicate themselves to creating innovative and interesting theatre and film. Run by young, wide-eyed, excitable people, SQUAD works hard to bring the best theatre possible to the stage and screen. Our dreams, however, have become bigger than our pockets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,<strong> HashtagRelationshipGoalz</strong> is being produced with no funding. Without some backing, we will be unable to get the show on it's feet and before you, our (wonderful) audience.</p>
<p>By the end of this campaign, we will be using the money raised to pay for our venue, rehearsal space, lights, costumes, set and marketing campaign. Every cent raised will be used to create the world of the story and the materials needed to do so.</p>
<p>We understand the meaning of 'every euro counts' and every single euro donated is extremely valuable to us. Whether it is the price of a pint or the price of a castle, whatever you can donate is worth more than the world to this production.</p>
<h3>Why should you donate?</h3>
<p>We would really love it, if you did!</p>
<p>Everyone at SQUAD is very excited about this show. After performing first as part of the Smock Allies: Scene + Heard Festival, every second of this heart-breaking and heart-wrenching story took our breath away. It has been such a full-filling process and we desperately want to share it with you! By donating to this campaign you are giving us the best chance to share this beautiful story with you all.</p>
<p>Not only will you get to see <strong>HashtagRelationshipGoalz</strong> again - bigger and more exciting than before - you will also be giving new, dedicated and extremely talented artists a chance to put their skills to work.</p>

<p>Ciara is your run of the mill, chicken burger plain with nothin’ on it kinda girl.  (Garlic sauce on the side, obvo.)

So what’s left to achieve, really?</p>
<p>Our story takes place on the plateaux that is the ‘during’ of a relationship.  Watch our wonder couple navigate through treacherous disruptions like deciding where to eat, your stepmam being a bollocks, your best friend being a dope, getting work off for a city break, an uninspired future existence, kleptomania and deciding which boxset to watch next.</p>
<p><strong>HashtagRelationshipGoalz</strong> began it's journey last year as part of the Smock Allies: Scene + Heard Festival. The sold-out performance went down incredibly with our diverse audience. It was a great show, so we decided to bring it back and make it even better.</p>
<p>This is SQUAD Productions 10th new play. Last year, Artistic Director Leah Moore won the best new writing award at the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival with her play Wasting Paper.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who Are We?</h3>
<p>We are a group of high-school students who came together last year for a summer Musical Theatre camp at Inspire Arts Academy. During the camp we wrote our own musical! We came up with the concept, characters, script, blocking, lyrics, choreography, set, and costumes (with a little help!).</p>
<p>Our teachers believed in us and believed in our idea. They encouraged us to workshop the idea to make a <strong>full-length musical</strong>, this time with our own original music as well. We lost some cast, found some cast, reworked, rewrote, and have come up with something we are really proud of.</p>
<p>All of us love performing but have been limited to our high-school theatre programs (as amazing as they are) and are craving the opportunity to see our own creation onstage. We're hard workers who are willing to pull our weight to make this happen, but we can't do it without your help.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Where Is My Donation Going?</h3>
<p>Any and all donations will be going towards the budget of creating our show. It costs a lot of money to put up a musical, even without paying for script-rights. Our goal has been calculated as our <i>ideal</i> budget, but any donations received enter the production fund.</p>
<p>Your donations will be going towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theatre Rental</li>
<li>Tech Rental (microphones, receivers, fog machines, special lighting, etc.)</li>
<li>Costume Materials</li>
<li>Prop Materials</li>
<li>Set Materials</li>
</ul>
<p>What we already have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal Space (a major cost to putting on a show)</li>
<li>A Director and Musical Director mentoring us</li>
<li>Access to Fight Directors, Lighting Designers, and Stage Management</li>
<li>A strong script and actors willing to put in the work to make it show-worthy</li>
<li>A cast and volunteers willing to help with costume, set, and prop creation</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't make our goal, we have back-up plans to cut down our costs. But we would like to have the budget to make this the best production value we can!</p>
<p>We will also be doing other fundraising activities, but we know crowd-funding can be a great resource!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Should I?</h3>
<p>You'll be supporting us in beginning our creative careers outside of school, as well as supporting arts in our community! There are many programs and opportunities for young children to perform theatre, as well as adults. But our demographic doesn't always have the same options available. </p>
<p>There are many community theatre groups out there putting great work into the world, but we haven't found another place willing to take a chance on a bunch of kids by putting their original ideas on a stage. We don't just want to be actors, we want to be writers, creators, and well-rounded artists. You'll be helping support that.</p>
<p>Also...we have perks!</p>
<p>If you donate you will receive funny, personal, and heartfelt thanks from us in the form of some quirky gifts that match the tone of our quirky, meta, comedy!</p>

We are a group of high-school students who came together last year for a summer Musical Theatre camp at Inspire Arts Academy. During the camp we wrote our own musical! We came up with the concept, characters, script, blocking, lyrics, choreography, set, and costumes (with a little help!).
Our teachers believed in us and believed in our idea. They encouraged us to workshop the idea to make a full-length musical, this time with our own original music as well. We lost some cast, found some cast, reworked, rewrote, and have come up with something we are really proud of.
All of us love performing but have been limited to our high-school theatre programs (as amazing as they are) and are craving the opportunity to see our own creation onstage. We're hard workers who are willing to pull our weight to make this happen, but we can't do it without your help.

My name is Elli Scharlin and I'm a senior at Wesleyan University.
Lost and Found is a fun, vulgar, fantastical, but most importantly, relevant coming of age story.
This musical is somewhere between Avenue Q, Into the Woods and The Wizard of Oz.
By reaching the campaign goal, I will be able to purchase the tools needed to bring a new dimension to my final Wesleyan hoorah (lights, props, costumes, etc...)


The Impact

Lost and Found explores the struggles of a dangerous species: Teenage Girls. It also does another thing, it redeems them...Girls need a show like this (and so do their parents).
This show allows for sexuality to be a positive and present aspect which is a more realistic approach to a coming of age story. 
Lost and Found follows Spencer Maude through a fantastical journey to reclaim her virginity. Along the journey, the audience engages with topics such as consensuality, loss, and family dynamics (I would want my teenager self to have seen this show).


Risks & Challenges

I am still looking for a performance space on Wesleyan's Campus that will fit the needs of the show.
We are currently in discussion with multiple on-campus venues to host our production.

<h2>Our Production - Gutenburg: The Musical</h2>
<p>Chris Adams presents <i>Gutenberg! The Musical!</i> by Anthony King and Scott Brown. Adams, a UVIC grad, has performed in some of the greatest theatres across Canada including The Globe in Regina, The Centaur in Montreal, and Vertigo in Calgary. Erik Gow is a Studio 58 graduate who works as a performer/teacher/multi-instrumentalist with such companies as The Arts Club, Gateway Theatre, TUTS, Chemainus Theatre Festival, Axis Theatre, and many more.  This professional dynamic duo has come together under the guidance of Axis Theatre’s Chris McGregor to present this two-man spoof, ahem, ode to Broadway.</p>
<p>In this whirlwind 90 minute musical comedy, Chris and Erik play over 30 characters. A pair of aspiring playwrights perform a backers’ audition for their new project - a big, splashy musical about printing press inventor Johann Gutenberg. With an unending supply of enthusiasm, Bud and Doug sing all the songs and play all the parts in their crass not-so-historically-accurate epic musical, with the hope that one of the producers in attendance will take them to Broadway – fulfilling their ill-advised dreams.</p>
<p>The Fringe Festival provides a valuable opportunity for professional artists to come together as collectives and produce work they are excited about, and on on much smaller budget than usual. Of course, there are still basic costs we need to cover — pianos to play, props to toss around, hats, hats, and hats! — not to mention finding room in the budget to compensate the artists for their time and talents. We believe art can pay in more than exposure or experience, and to that end we need you help!</p>
<h3>Let’s Crunch the Numbers</h3>
<p>Here's the basic equation we’re working with:</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Production Costs — $6000.00</p>
<p>Our biggest budget items include the show rights ($2400), venue ($800), and fringe fees ($500). They do not include paying anyone on the creative team — under usual equity contracts, our artists fees would be higher than our entire production budget for this show. Fringe makes it possible to do this show without that money, but of course, it also means… we’re doing it without that money. </p>
<p>Instead, the project is running as a profit share — anything we make on the show is divided among the artists as compensation for their time and talents in mounting the show. An excellent idea until we look at our next figure.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Potential Ticket Revenue — $4800.00</p>
<p>You see the challenge. Even with all contributors working for free, the production operates at a loss. We are asking for your sponsorship to help us balance this equation, and to help us put the profit back in profit share.</p>
<h3>Your End of the Equation</h3>
<p>We are really excited about what you’ll find on your end of the equation. With perks ranging from our endless gratitude and the critical title of “Headgear Hero” to the possibility of joining Erik and Chris on stage for your moment in the spotlight, we’re hoping there’s something to inspire everyone. </p>
<h2>Why Gutenburg?</h2>
<p>With over 30 characters between two performers, this show makes the most of our dynamic performers’ physical and vocal talents, and their ability to transform from one person to the next. It can be difficult to stage in such a way that keeps the story and the characters crisp and clear. When you nail it, however, you are rewarded with a show that is witty and highly hilarious, and carries the audience through a roller coaster of roles and personas. </p>
<p>Gutenberg: The Musical suits the Fringe to a tee! It’s simple — just two guys and a box of hats. It’s engaging — its play-within-a-play narrative placing the audience right in the room with the characters, a real and present part of their world. And finally, when you get down to it, it’s about two artists determined to find a venue for their artistic dreams — hey, what’s the Fringe for?</p>
<h3>We Know It Won’t Be Easy</h3>
<p>We’ve got out work cut out for us. There are upwards of 80 other shows going up at the Vancouver Fringe this year, so there will be lots of amazing work for audiences to choose from. Being seen and heard is a challenge, but we are determined to stand out and fill our audience each night! </p>
<p>Luckily, we’ve got a passionate team of experienced performers and problems solvers on board. Gutenberg! The Muscial! marks the 11th musical Chris Adams has produced over the past 5 years, and he knows a thing or two about producing quality work on a tight budget. </p>
<p>Finding audiences isn’t the only challenge — a two-hand 90 minute show requires some serious stamina to execute! Erik and Chris are more than up to the challenge, having worked together before, as well as with their director Chris McGregor. This team is tried and true!</p>
<p>We have the plan! The pieces are in place! Now we need your support!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Help Spread the Word!</h2>
<p>When Johann Gutenberg invented the printing press, it revolutionized the spread of information, making it possible for people to share their thoughts, feelings, and opinions far and wide. </p>
<p>In 2017 we all have this ability in our pockets, we invite you to say thanks to Mr. Gutenberg by getting on social media and spreading the word about the show and our campaign. </p>
<p>Whether or not you’re able to become a sponsor, your support is incredibly valuable!</p>

Fear No Colours is a non-profit company, meaning we do not have the resources to pay any of our artists, make a living from our work or even cover our expenses.

We're creating two mind-blowing shows that we're super proud of and know can do really well at the festival, and when there's no public funds to help us get there, we're hoping that you will! Last year, three of our actors got paid, professional acting jobs from 'being discovered' in FNC shows, and we really want to create more opportunities like that for our team.</p><p>We want our fundraising campaign to be fun - we take our work so seriously that we need to let loose on the side and we would love for our friends and supporters to join us in the good times!

Founded in 2009, Leviathan Lab is a professional creative studio that invests in the advancement of Asian American performing artists. Leviathan was founded with the goal of expanding the reach of Asian American artistic voices and telling our stories to communities who haven't yet heard nor had the joy of experiencing them. Our projects – online, on film, and on stage – strive to show Asian Americans in innovative and dynamic ways: sexy, powerful, vital, and fun. Theatre and film production in New York City is an expensive endeavor, and your help is essential in helping us do this important work. Your contribution will help us secure:
Rehearsal rooms and performance venues
Performer and technical artist fees
Production, venue, and, rehearsal insurance
Production costs, including costumes, sets, lights, and publicity
Your contribution is tax-deductible to the fullest extent allowed by law, and will help to jump start our fundraising efforts for our 2014-2015 project roster, which includes:

For the past 3 years, I have been a board member of Busted Space Theatre Company. This past school year, Busted Space has grown immensely. In addition to our normal mainstays, we have, for the first time in our short history, a season! The next event we have coming up in our season is the full production of <i>Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play</i> by Anne Washburn.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Burns </i>is a play that deals with the question of what we're left with after a disaster. Following a large-scale, possibly global, nuclear meltdown, the world is left without power. Without electricity, the world is forced to live off the essentials. But what then? You have to be entertained. And what's better entertainment than <i>The Simpsons</i>? The group of survivors in the show go from remembering a <i>Simpsons</i> episode around a campfire, to 7 years later when they have formed a travelling theatre troupe to perform episodes of <i>The Simpsons</i>, to 75 years after that when their show has become a grand, masked musical theatre performance.</p>
<p>As a contributor, you will be helping this production happen. Busted Space is an entirely student-run organization, so therefore, we don't have any overhead. Donations to this show would help us make better sets and props to enhance our production and do this amazing script justice. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>For this production, we've budgeted out $500. This budget is going to cover payment of rights, printing of marketing materials, lighting fixture rental, dramaturgical display printing, costumes, props, and IndieGoGo fees. While we don't expect to come in under budget, if we happen to have extra funds after the production, they will be donated to the Department of Theatre and Dance at Ball State for Student Scholarships.</p>
<p>We have a lot of fun perks for this project, including social media shout outs, signed posters, a pizza party with the cast, and the masks of <i>Simpsons</i> characters used in Act 3 of the show! Be sure to check them out and donate to the perk that you find most exciting!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We're students. We're not interested in making money off of this show. So, any profit made on this production will be donated to the Department of Theatre and Dance at Ball State to go to Student Scholarships.</p>
<p>Our production offers many opportunities for directors, dramaturgs, actors, and designers. By funding this project, you are helping Undergraduates in the Department of Theatre and Dance to gain more experience before we graduate and head into the real world. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are no more significant hurdles than there are for any other theatrical performance. Props break, accidents happen, but I would call myself a bad member of the Ball State Department of Theatre and Dance if I said that I wasn't able to handle a crisis. </p>
<p>With our cast of 8 actors, 3 understudies, 2 assistant directors, 2 stage managers, and production team of about 8 more, I can confidently say that any accidents or unfortunate events will be ably taken care of.</p>

Havana Love Letters is a new ballet with an original score, and the first collaboration between Cuba’s Institute of the Arts (the famed El ISA)  and a team of artists from the U.S. 

Havana Love Letters  brings Cuban dancers together with choreographer Suki John, composer Joel Diamond, scenic designer Brian Clinnin and costume designer Murell Horton.
In June 2016, Havana Love Letters will workshop at Cuba's Teatro Bertolt Brecht as part of the Festival of the Arts. 


Havana Love Letters is actively developing cultural relations between the US and Cuba!


Help us extend an olive branch through dance, one of the most basic forms of human communication!

The production process will be filmed and photographed, so this historic collaboration can be shared on the screen as well as the stage. Once the ballet has been developed, it will be available for professional companies in Cuba and the U.S.

Magnitude of This Collaboration 




A project of this size and scope builds cooperation between our two peoples, who have been kept apart for far too long.


Dance goes far beyond the spoken word, communicating across language and distance. Havana Love Letters - or Cartas de Amor as it is titled in Cuba - creates a bridge across time and cultures. 


Our Funding Goals


Our goal is to raise $10,000 with this platform. The funds raised here will pay for transportation, housing for our team, costumes and set elements.

Meeting this goal guarantees that Cuban drivers, translators and filmmakers who are not paid by El ISA will be compensated fairly for their work on the project.
