<p>I am a certified life coach with a Masters degree in counseling and psychology.  Since 2007 I've been working with clients who want to live happier lives.   I LOVE my work!</p>
<p><b>A BIG part of happiness and inner peace is GRATITUDE</b>, so  I wrote a book <i>Year of Gratitude</i>.  There is no other book like it in the world!  It takes readers on a year long journey exploring gratitude in some unique and powerful ways!  </p>
<p>I'm raising money to get <i>Year of Gratitude</i> published in a book format.  Until now, it's been an e.book that is sent a little each week - and printed at home with journal pages.  But readers have said it would be pretty great if they could have it complete and resting on their nightstand.</p>
<p>When you contribute to this fund, you help raise the money needed to get Y<i>ear of Gratitude</i> published and in the hands of more people!  And that's really fabulous because <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the more people who are living a grateful, happy, peaceful life - the closer we are to having a happier world!  Let's do it!!!  Woo.Hoo!!</span></p>
<p>I need another $2,200 to get it published.  I have the rest saved, but as a single mom, saving is a little tough right now. </p>
<p><b>Within that amount - my book will be printed complete with: a designed front- and back-cover as well as the interior design with journal pages &amp; special colors/fonts,  its own ISBN and Library of Congress Control Number, formatting and distribution, selling in national book markets, a personalized bookstore page, U.S. Copyright registration, a 'see inside the book' feature, marketing and promotional materials to get it into the world, and much more to help the book be a success!</b></p>
<p>I've created some fabulous perks to say 'Thank you' for helping me get published!  There is plenty to choose from: autographed and personalized copies of Year of Gratitude, having your name in the book, baseball caps with my logo, and even a  membership into my program Happiness of You (worth $398).  </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I deeply appreciate your support, and I want to show you my gratitude by sending you some wonderful gifts!</span></p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, the funds will go to a special account I already have set up.  This account is my savings for publishing… you see, <i>Year of Gratitude</i> is my first book.  It's a tough market to break into, but once you have one book (self)published, you start getting taken a bit more seriously.   </p>
<p>This account is set up to help me with<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> two <i>other</i> books I am currently writing.  Although I hope these two books will be published traditionally (rather than self.published), I am saving and saving and saving just in case I need to self.pub those too.  </span></p> </div> <div> <h3>A Happier World :)</h3>
<div>You might wonder… is this book really necessary in our world?  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Yes!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Anything that helps people live happier, more peaceful lives is a perk to our world!  Let's face it - there are many reasons to feel sad or scared or angry - just turn on the news, and you'll see reasons.  BUT we need more reasons to celebrate the good stuff in life and in the world!   <i>Year of Gratitude</i> does that!  It lifts people's hearts, it helps them appreciate more, it provides them reminders of why to be happy, it teaches them how to find gratitude in some different places!</div>

</div> <div> <h3>Why I am trustworthy</h3> <p>I know I am asking you to donate to my book - which is also my dream and passion.  You might wonder… can I trust Shannon?</p>
<p>Yes you can.</p>
<p>If you know me at all - you'll know the love I have for helping people and for being a source of hope in our world.  You'll also know how hard I have worked as a single mom (at times holding three jobs) to take care of my kids without losing time with them and to be independent.  </p>
<p>I have also made choices - selling/giving things I don't need to get a little extra money, and choosing to forego unnecessary perks of a mid.west American woman  (new clothes and fancy hair for example) - so I could use my money on what matters more to me (yes, many of my clothes were given to me for free, and yes, you will have seen me with faaaar too much gray hair for a single lady of my age :) ). </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Are there any risks?</h3>
<p>There are NO challenges with this project.  The book is written and edited.  It is ready for submission, AND I have been working with a lovely lady, Virginia, at a self.publishing house.  All I need is the money to get it in print!</p>
<p>Oh, and I must mention… I have worked hard at growing a platform (a following of sorts - on social media and via my website - over 5,000 people).  I'm also doing more and more public speaking, so I  know I can get this book into the hands of many people!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><em><strong>I make my living writing and selling short stories/books. Until now, I've written everything on an old mac that more closely resembles an old typewriter than an actual computer. I'd like to raise enough funds to purchase a slightly newer computer so that I can continue working as a writer and put out my next novel unhindered. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong></strong></em> <br/></p> </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Without your assistance and kindness, I'll be unable to continue working. Please consider helping any way you can.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Macbook Pro I'm hoping to purchase is going to cost me $600 dollars. Unfortunately, I'm moving across the country to Portland, Oregon to pursue ministry and work on my next novel. Obviously, this is an expensive endeavor and any money I'm able to save is put toward that expense. I've decided to reprint a collection of Travel Journals I kept while I was living homeless in New York CIty, Paris, Tennessee and Nassau, Bahamas. Those of you who are following my work know that I am working on a novel called Forest Life. Much of the inspiration behind Forest Life can be found in these Travel Logs. So, in exhange for your donation you'll receive a copy of Travel Logs and my most sincere thanks<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please consider donating, and keep me in your prayers as I continue writing in the manner I feel God has called me. Please share my fundraising goal with your friends and contact me if you have any questions.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>

<h3>Who Is Lauren Yates?</h3>
<p>Hi, everyone. My name is Lauren Yates, and I'm the poet behind this operation. I've been writing poetry regularly since I was twelve years old. I continued writing throughout middle school and high school, and regularly contibuted to my high school's literary magazine.</p>
<p>I did not start performing my poetry until Fall 2009, when I joined <a href=""http://excelanoproject.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Excelano Project</a>--the premier spoken word collective at the University of Pennsylvania. After performing non-competitively for 3 years, I started slamming this past September.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, a poetry slam is a competition in which poets perform original material and receive scores for their writing and performance abilities. For me, slamming isn't about winning; it's about the opportunity to share <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE829BB926FA9CD48"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my work</a> and hear other people's voices.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Is WOWps?</h3>
<p>The Women of the World Poetry Slam (WOWps) is an annual event sponsored by <a href=""http://poetryslam.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Poetry Slam, Inc.</a> that allows poets who live as woman an exclusive space in which to slam. The event began in 2008 as an offset of the National Poetry Slam and the Individual World Poetry Slam. WOWps 2013 will take place in Minneapolis from March 6-9, 2013.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where Will This Money Go?</h3>
This money will go exclusively toward my plane ticket to Minneapolis.</div>
<div>
<h3>What's In It for You?</h3>
<p>By helping send me to WOWps, you are also helping to diversify Philadelphia's representation in the spoken word scene. Until this year, Philadelphia only had one PSI-certified venue: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FuzePoetry?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The FUZE</a>. However, just last month <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/thephillypigeon?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Pigeon</a> became certified, and I will be their first ever representative at a PSI event.</p>
<p>Helping me get to this competition will pave the way for The Pigeon to send representatives to the National Poetry Slam and the Individual World Poetry Slam later this year.</p>

Amber and I, in conjunction with Tire Swing Comics, are in the process of working out an agreement where creative projects could be what my time is entirely dedicated to.</p>
<p>Currently I have a day job and would love to leave it to pursue a career of stories and comics. But a variety of mistakes with credit cards in my past means I have a lot of debt, and a creative-only pursuit is not affordable right now. This means I have to keep my day job, which means I don't have the time to dedicate to the stories and comics.</p>
<p>This fundraiser is not intended to retire the entirety of my debt, but to help with the immediately-resolvable so that the rest can be better managed. I haven't used a credit card in five years, but what I am able to pay each month doesn't make much headway versus interest earned.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">With your help I can retire the small debt cards and shift the money I'd been putting towards those towards the big ones. Once those are done your long-term benefit, if you are a fan of my work, is my ability to leave my day job and switch to working on stories and comics which will be made available to everyone.</span></p>

<p>I want to be clear - successful funding of this fundraiser will still leave me with some debt to resolve before I can completely give up my day job. My fans and readers should not expect to see significant changes to my available creative time until sometime in <b>2015</b>.</p>

<p>Managing time for the story commissions is the biggest challenge here. I have done commissions like this previously on limited-release purchases, and I am not aware of a commissioner who has been left unsatisfied. They typically take three weeks per 10,000 words to complete, which is why I have limited each Perk level to a maximum of 10 commissions. It breaks down like this;<br/></p>
<p><b>1st Week</b> - Donor is contacted via email, ideas are exchanged, donor approves an outline I create based on their requested idea/topic with the goal of finishing at 10,000 words minimum - I will not bring a story to a screeching halt once 10,000 words is met but I won't drag out the tale's resolution unnecessarily beyond that.</p>
<p><b>2nd Week</b> - I complete a rough copy and send it to the donor for review and any notes.</p>
<p><b>3rd Week</b> - I finish editing the story based on notes and create a final PDF copy for the donor.</p>
<p>I will work on commissions in the order in which they were purchased. <b>Illustrations</b> will take more time and will have input from the donor, but the majority of the creative control will be left with the artist. My artists are usually able to deliver an illustration within a month.</p>
<p>I will only write about original characters created by the donor or by me. <b>I retain ownership</b> rights to all original work created by me. The story will remain exclusive to the donor's personal reading <b>for at least one year</b>, after which I reserve the right to edit and republish.</p>

<h3>Green Writers Press</h3>
<p><i>Giving Voice to Writers and Artists Who Will Make the World a Better Place</i></p>
<p><b>Thanks for visiting our fundraising page! </b>We are a new Vermont-based, global publisher that seeks to change the way books are printed by using only post-consumer waste paper and not virgin timber. All the books published by Green Writers Press will be printed in Vermont by a family-owned business. The term 'localvore' applies to the publisher's mission, which is also to publish books, eBooks, and audio books that will spread a message of hope and renewal. We strive to build awareness to stop global warming.</p>
<p>It is <a href=""http://greenwriterspress.com/sample-page/mission/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our mission</a>, at Green Writers Press, to spread a message of environmental activism through the words and images we will publish. We also plan to publish books that segue with our mission that also include other subjects that speak to Pquality of life and the beauty of nature. Printing on demand (POD), and using only “tree-free” papers printed at our Vermont printer, Springfield Printing Corporation, we will adhere to GWP’s commitment to preserving and protecting the natural resources of the earth. To that end, a percentage of our proceeds will be donated to the environmental activist group, <a href=""http://350.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">350.org</a>. We will also give a percentage of our profits directly to Vermont-based environmental organizations and other groups.</p>
<p>Our vision is that, collectively, our printed and eBooks will become a chorus of voices of writers and readers, artists and photographers, who care about the fate of the earth and want to do something about it. Though we believe our books will be interesting to Vermont residents, Green Writers Press has national distribution and we hope to have a broad reach and impact. Our voices need to be heard, which is why we refer to our press as a global press. We are—we all are connected on this planet we love. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The money raised will go a long way…</h3>
<p>Our books will be printed with soy-based inks on paper made from pulp that comes from post-consumer waste paper in <i>a family-owned, FSC-certified printer, located in Vermont</i> utilizing responsible environmental, social, and economic practices; made with a chlorine-free process. Environmentally-responsible and sustainable practices are embraced within this, our mission statement. We are exploring printing on other materials as well, such as organic hemp from Canada, kenaf, and arundo donax (similar to bamboo). Our goal is to never use virgin timber fiber for our paper used to print our books. To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount is what we have budgeted for our first season of printing the books.</li>
<li>Our books are printed on recycled paper IN VERMONT! </li>
<li>Our funds will go to help offset our first printing bills, and be applied there first.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your support will help us with our start-up expenses: Advertising, purchasing book identifier numbers, and printing costs—which are the main expenses. </p>
<ul>
<li>We are just beginning the process of publishing our own authors! It is an exciting time, and we welcome your support and help to spread the word.</li>
<li>Check out this sweet video of one of our new fans, Stella, at the Burlington Book Festival where our first published book was a smash hit : <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l35YFRcBAKs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l35YFRcBAKs</a>
</li>
<li>In today’s world of social media and online transactions, here are GWP, we remember that your head and your heart need nourishment from the natural world. With that as our credo, we embark on a journey to bring the beauty of the published book as a tactile object, into the homes and hands of our readers, and we also embrace the technology of tablet and eBook publishing.</li>
<li>We will encourage our buyers to shop LOCAL first, <a href=""http://www.indiebound.org/affiliate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">and use this link</a> to find their local bookstore. </li>

Check out this sweet video of one of our new fans, Stella, at the Burlington Book Festival where our first published book was a smash hit : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l35YFRcBAKs

In today’s world of social media and online transactions, here are GWP, we remember that your head and your heart need nourishment from the natural world. With that as our credo, we embark on a journey to bring the beauty of the published book as a tactile object, into the homes and hands of our readers, and we also embrace the technology of tablet and eBook publishing.
We will encourage our buyers to shop LOCAL first, and use this link to find their local bookstore. 
Collectively, our voices can be heard—the earth is silent and awaits our action.



Other Ways You Can Help

Please welcome our first titles, and we have a few more coming along to join us! If you’d like to pre-order a copy of the books listed here, as print-on-demand, or eBook, just contact your local, independent bookstore with the information found here at our national book distributor—KNOW YOUR SUPPORT WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE! 
Once the books are available—beginning in October, 2013—they are yours to receive and ours to share. We are very excited, and welcome your thoughts and ideas and suggestions. 
Make an investment today, and share this message with all of your friends who love great literature and care about the fate of the earth. 
Thanks! —Dede, Robin, Alexandra, and the many authors and artists: Brian, Holiday, Greg, John E., Howard, Leland, Patti, Jade, Alok, Hollie, Claire, Steve, Willow, Zachary, John W., printer—Mark, Mary Anne, Jim, etc.—and the rest of our fabulous team.

<h3><strong style=""font-size: 10px;"">Momentum Publishing House began as a way to bring publishing back to the community; to involve young people in something be proud of.</strong></h3>
<p><span><span><span>Momentum Publishing is a community lead project, run entirely by volunteers. We started with a one off magazine and have progressed to a regularly updated website with reviews and news articles relating to 16-25's.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Now we'd like to publish our first book; we'll provide the patform for young talent in publishing that we believe isn’t otherwise there – a sort of half way house between self publishing and a large publishing house.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The book will be an anthology of short stories, we'll do a short 100 book print run. Copies of which we'll sell online, try our luck with local bookshops and also supply the book as an ebook to be available on kindle, app book store and other leading ebook sellers. The profits will be split 50/50 with the writers, half goes to them, half goes towards printing the next book &amp; marketing.</p>
<p>In order to do this we need start up funds for:</p>
<ul>
<li>ISBN's &amp; registering as an official publishing house. We'll be bulk buying a pack of 10, so we don't have to fundraise for the next 9 books</li>
<li>The short print run. Here at Momentum Publishing, we believe in the beauty of books, so we think it's worth spending the money on some gorgeous prints.</li>
<li>Our cover designer- we're currently running a competition for the cover design, with a cash prize of £50. If we get this funding we'll be able to pay the winning designer more, which would be fantastic. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Publishing is currently an incredibly difficult industry to break into, especially for new writers fresh out of school/college/university. These are also people unlikely to have novels ready and written, so Momentum wants to work with young writers to help develop both their skills and confidence - also a great thing for them to have on their CV. Our days would absolutely be made if one of the writers that started off with us got their very own publishing contract with a large company one day, because we helped them at the start.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hola Amigos..my name is Luis,  I'm Honduran and for many years the idea of walking the Camino de Santiago its been on my head, I'll be 32 soon, so I planned with a couple of crazy friends, Max and Rolando (Not in shape at all) and with few sins to expiate,  to walk 800 kilometers trail on northern Spain, it will be about 25km a day, we are full inmersed
and convinced in this Don Quijote style journey, with reflexions, maybe
find ourselves,  maybe lose ourselves ( hopefully), documenting everything through the lens
of our cameras and writing on our journals the details of our
experience during the way.<br/></p>

<p>For nearly two decades now I've been making my living solely through the creative word. I am a poet, small press publisher, oral memoirist and encourager who resides with his family in the hills of upstate NY. From our 50 acre homestead I go out into the world as a poet, giving readings and conducting workshops. A year ago we had a tragic house fire in which all of our personal possessions and publishing equipment, supplies and archives were lost. It has been a long haul rebuilding, but through the amazing support of so many people, near at hand and far away, we have a new house and have been moving forward, resuming the publishing work and my own work on the road as a poet. An Indiegogo Campaign was instrumental in making that happen.</p>
<p>I have had in mind a 48 State poetry tour for a number of years. Now that we have stabilized our life after the fire, I felt it was time to make the dream real. I turned 62 in November. How much time ahead is there? We never know. If I don't do this tour now, will I have a chance in the future? I have taken many cross-country poetic journeys but never one of this length in miles or time. I'll be away from home on this solo journey for 14 weeks.</p>
<p>The Poems Across America Tour will feature 48 readings in 48 states. I have nearly half of them confirmed and will be working on finishing the booking over the next few weeks. Currently I have readings booked in small towns and large cities, at libraries, book stores, an adult learning center, colleges and even someone's house. This will be an eclectic mix of venues and geographic settings. Much like other poetic journeys I have taken, only this one is much more comprehensive.</p>
<p>Over the years that I've gone on the road as a poet, encouraging others in their own creativity, I've learned to not be amazed at the wonderful poets who can be found anywhere and everywhere. I encourage others to express themselves at whatever level of competency they are at. We were all beginners once. Partly because of my encouragement there are scores of writers groups meeting regularly, sharing in the joy of the written word.</p>
<p>The Poems Across America Tour is the most extensive tour I've undertaken, twice as long as any other tour. When on the road I live simply, camping, bartering books for motels and couches, preparing my own food as much as possible. There are times when motels are the best alternative. And one cannot barter for gasoline. Living on the edge (a kid who grew up in the 60s and has held onto a lot of those values, and the poetry/poverty dynamic) there are always financial concerns in any undertaking. To have the travel expenses taken care of before departure would be a huge blessing.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I've estimated that the mileage for the tour will be somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 miles. At about fifteen cents a mile for gas (forget the 56.5/mi federal mileage allowance, I drive old cars - this journey with a 1983 Honda Accord) I estimate a gas cost at about $2,700. Obviously that's not all the travel expenses involved, but I plan on keeping the other expenses to a minimum by bartering, camping and even sleeping in the car if need be. I have learned to live frugally. It's a virtue.</p>
<p>As far as perks, you'll receive an original haiku on a postcard from the state of your choosing. There are various levels of donations, relating to how many states you'll receive postcards from. I will write an original haiku from each state that will be the haiku on the postcard. This haiku will not be used anywhere else other than on the postcard. So, in a sense, one of a kind, even though anyone else wanting a postcard from that state will receive the same haiku. The postcards will be ones I purchase in the state and the haiku will be hand written, signed and dated.</p>
<p>If I don't reach the goal the journey will still happen, with a little bit more apprehension involved. That's not always a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Often, over the years I have been just pursuing the poetic path, I've had people refer to me as Michael Poetseed. They see me as spreading poetry seeds around the country and sometime later the seeds germinate and there's more poetry growing, blooming throughout the land. I have had many experiences that validate that image and are part of my oral memoirs. I feel blessed to be able to walk this path, yet, it always comes with a compromise. Poetry/poverty again. My life has been one of poverty in terms of $$$, but rich in other more important ways. I feel this tour will help me reach out to others in a much wider way than ever before. As Lew Welch wrote in ""This Book Is For Magda"" - ""and now and then, a son, a daughter hears it./ Now and then, a son, a daughter,/ gets away.""</p>
<p>If you can help in any way to fund the travel expenses of this tour it would be very much appreciated. If you are not in a position to donate, please consider helping by getting the word out to others that you know. Indiegogo works by spreading the word out as much as possible. We learned that from the amazingly successful Indiegogo campaign to help us get a new house after the fire. This is obviously not on the same level as that, but this journey means a lot to me and any support that comes my way toward the travel expenses would be greatly appreciated.</p></div>","Short Summary

<h3>Help us Fight Against Houseless Authors!!</h3>
<p>Yes, you read that right.  Not homeless, houseless.  Sadly there are many fabulous authors with quality, finished works and careers on the rise who are set back when their publishing house closes.  We have found many authors in this situation, and have built a publishing house dedicated to not only making sure that these works remain available and promoted as they should be, but also to finding and publishing new works.

<p>The purpose of the funding is twofold.  First, it is imperative that the authors - and their fans- are still able to access their books during this transitional period.  Therefore, a portion of the funding will be used to purchase an adequate number of books as they are currently printed, to be sure that there is no gap in availability.  Secondly, funds will be used in the startup costs of the new house.  Such costs include buying a domain, purchasing ISBNs, creating and printing catalogs for wholesale purchases, paying for new cover art, purchasing marketing materials, and obtaining booth space at high-visibility events.  </p>
<p>To ensure our success, we have developed a plan for measured growth.  We want to make sure that we have enough titles to make our press a viable, strong force, but are careful to make sure that we don't overextend ourselves financially or sacrifice quality for quantity.  We have been lucky enough to have a professional project manager and chief financial officer donate their time and services to help us grow at an exciting but sustainable rate.  We also have developed an amazing three-pronged marketing plan.  As our house currently publishes speculative fiction works, it is important that we take advantage of the fans and niche market that can be found at science fiction and fantasy conventions.  To that end, we have plans to attend PopCon, Emerald City Comi-Con, North Carolina Comi-Con, Conglomeration, Magna-Cum-Murder, and more.  The second prong involves taking advantage of local interest.  Our experience has shown that local festivals often have significantly lower booth fees and generate a great deal of interest and sales. Therefore, we will work with our authors to find and obtain space at small local festivals.  Finally, for greater success it will be important to move beyond the world of conventions and into the mainstream.  We have already secured space at the Savannah Children's Book Fair and the American Library Association's yearly conference.  We will continue to look for book and literature fairs opportunities, and are researching the Espresso Printing Machines as a way to build excitement and reduce stock costs.  </p>

Yes, you read that right.  Not homeless, houseless.  Sadly there are many fabulous authors with quality, finished works and careers on the rise who are set back when their publishing house closes.  We have found many authors in this situation, and have built a publishing house dedicated to not only making sure that these works remain available and promoted as they should be, but also to finding and publishing new works.

<p>The writer and the illustrator, who up to now have worked with no retribution, will create new situation-illustrations, based on suggestions from the readers.

<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Long summary:-) </em></strong></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Andrei Kelner, and I am Bookata’s publisher. We’ve developed an innovative way of personalized storytelling through collaborative iBooks.  Our tales are centered on challenges our kids encounter and the ways that we as adults can deal with those challenges, using their own stories and the way that they tell them with their feelings and words. Bookata has a story to tell, and that story is yours! For Bookata, the reader IS the story.</p>
<p>The narrators have imagined dramatic, yet funny potential situations created by the adoption of a pet. Your book can be personalized by changing the main character, the family members, the children, the parents, their names, race, and gender. Your Bookata story will feel unique because it is unique.</p>
<p>Based on feedback and suggestions from readers, we decided to add a new illustration-situation, reproducing one of the most popular pet mischiefs: mayhem provoked by a pet when it penetrates forbidden territory, the bathroom... more precisely, the mess with the toilet paper roll.</p>
<p>A while ago, I read and fell in love with a short fable, <em>A Story for Demented Children</em>, by John H. Carroll. From Denver, where he lives surrounded by family and pets, he accepted the request to write for Bookata this lovely tale of personalized adoption. We were also incredibly lucky to find a most remarkable illustrator for this project. Living in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Claudia Mendoza is not only a cat lover, but a dancer and a writer.</p>
<p>They accepted to work initially for free, intrigued by the new publishing paradigm proposed and excited to create ""live"" when the readers start asking for personal changes to the story.</p>
<p>In its generic version, their final product was ranked number one on the Amazon Kindle store in the Children's Fiction/Animals category. That’s right, Bookata's tale topped out Jungle Book and other major classic-free titles!</p>
<p>Here is the book on Amazon: (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/A-New-Pet-Family-ebook/dp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.amazon.com/A-New-Pet-Family-ebook/dp</a>... 1363092193&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=bookata).</p>

<p><strong><em>What We Need and What You Get</em></strong></p>
<p>Our campaign is simple and extremely focused: we need a total of $500.</p>
<p>Our project is about ONE single situation to be added to a single story, ONE short text and ONE illustration with three embodiments representing three kinds of pets.</p>
<p>Once the text and illustration are conceived and incorporated, we will make them available to ALL readers/users. That’s correct; everybody will have the opportunity to enjoy this new situation-illustration. And if our crowdfunding experiment proves to be a success, we hope to have many more to come.</p>
<p>You may be asking, “Why should I advance the funds when everybody else will get it for free afterwards?”</p>
<ul>
<li>Because is the right thing to do, AND you get recognition for it (see perks).</li>
<li>Because if you need something to be done, just do it instead of waiting for somebody else to do it.</li>
<li>Because you will allow children to have their own particular story told their way, in their words, complemented by meaningful illustrations.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>On our side, we have a couple of commitments, also:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are committed to paying our artists a full, fair price for their efforts. Don’t let a flexible campaign status inhibit this chance to show your utmost appreciation and respect for their talent.</li>
<li>We are committed to this daring experiment of ""live"" collaboration between readers and creators.</li>
<li>We are committed to putting all the money raised above $500 towards the payment for a new illustration, also decided by readers.</li>
</ul><p>Somehow, I feel there is too much experimentation for such a small proposal. Will the people find all this too much? We will see in a very short period of time. Stay tuned and thank you for your support.</p>

<p><span>Isabelle is now 19 and has watched her siblings and friends grow up and move on to college and careers.

<p>My name is Rosalind Dawson. I am 56 years old. I was born and raised in the inner city of Milwaukee, WI -- a child prodigy, or so the folks at our local music conservatory said. I started playing the piano at 2-years-old. I could hear any song live or on the radio and sit down at our old piano and play it. It’s called perfect pitch I found out later and few people worldwide have it. That should have made me feel special as a kid, but it didn’t.</p>

</div></div>","My story:
My name is Rosalind Dawson. I am 56 years old. I was born and raised in the inner city of Milwaukee, WI -- a child prodigy, or so the folks at our local music conservatory said. I started playing the piano at 2-years-old. I could hear any song live or on the radio and sit down at our old piano and play it. It’s called perfect pitch I found out later and few people worldwide have it. That should have made me feel special as a kid, but it didn’t.
You see, things were happening to me that trumped all the good God had blessed me with; things that no child should have done to them. By the time I was a teenager I was having disassociative episodes amd ideations of suicide. I called helplines constantly searching for anyone who could help me understand.

Le plus vieux language de l'homme
Et sans doute l'une des langues les moins comprises à l'aube du XXIème siècle. L'homme moderne et - encore plus ""l'homo electronicus"" - a perdu le sens de ce language pourtant universel.
Dans la lignée de nos autres manuels, ici pas de ""théorie"" fumeuse sur les mouvements oculaires. Et encore moins d'empirisme attribuant à chaque geste une signification précise et unique!
En 10 ans, la science du non-verbal a fait des progrès considérables suite à des investissements financiers importants liés aux besoins d'améliorer la sécurité. Il est temps de proposer une première grammaire de ses grands principes.
SCAN101 en quelques lignes ? 
SCAN est d'abord :

Une méthode qui repose sur une acquisition rapide des indicateurs nécessaires à l'établissement d'un profil.
D'une intégration dans l'environnement de l'individu. On ne peut lire tout le monde à n'importe quel moment ! Sans objectif précis, il est parfaitement inutile de SCANner quelqu'un.
Une grammaire des grands principes du non-verbal. Documentée scientifiquement, cette approche permet d'éviter le catalogue gestuel imbitable.
Une application discrète ne bloquant pas vos activités quotidiennes. Après tout, vous n'êtes pas un spécialiste du comportement...
Une grille qui s'adapte à vos propres compétences pour enrichir vos intuitions et non les remplacer. 
ET le secret :  chacun des principes a été analysé/validé/confirmé au travers d'études dédiées ET sous EEG portatifs. Une première mondiale, l'exploitation des EEG portatifs a permis de tester les principes lors d'interactions réelles dans le monde réel.

<h3>About the Perks: Whether we reach my funding goal or not, you will receive your perks.

<p>Since January 2012, I have written countless pages of notes about my life and the things that happened to me and the people around me until now. It has been a year of extremes in every possible sense of the term, so unreal that I feel like it is in fact a story worth telling, and a story worth reading. It's the kind of year that changes your life in a sense that it redefines everything you thought you knew.<br/><br/>I am a 32 year old graphic designer and writer, and 2012 was a rollercoaster for me. It started off with a seemingly broken beyond repair heart, no job, no perspective and the certainty that I had nothing left in this world. I was looking back at about a decade of failures, regrets and dispointments.</p>
<p>And then, life happened in the form of my soulmate. I met her in the most unusual of places, and she felt the same way about me almost instantly. It was unexpected, mutual and utterly overwhelming. It was the ""where were you all my life?"" type of bond that nothing could scratch. It was the purest and most genuine form of happiness I had ever experienced. She saved my life.</p>
<p>Our love was however put to the test. Unprecedented tragedy struck, but we made it through everything life threw at us. It was a connection that transcends proximity, consciousness and choice. It was there, it couldn't be denied, and we know it will never fade.</p>
<p>And then, death happened. Not even ten days ago, devastating tragedy struck again, and the relationship took a hit we thought it couldn't take. My soulmate had to re-arrange her life, take on new responsibilities and priorities.</p>
<p><em>Rebecca</em> is the journey that will soon take me across the ocean in an ultimate attempt at finding the love of my life.<br/><br/>It's a story about despair, love, happiness and tragedy. It's a story about distance and soulmates. It's a story about patience, hope and dreams and the attempt to make them come true. It's about a once in a lifetime shot at happiness. It's our story, and it is yet to be concluded.<br/><br/>Rebecca has no idea about this trip.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If, with your help, I eventually reach my funding goal, I will self-publish my story. It will be in German, but I will have it translated professionally into English. Here's how I plan on distributing the funds:</p>
<p>• My journey to the United States to conclude my story: ca. $1.500,-<br/>• Self-publishing costs: ca. $ 10.000,- depending on the number of copies<br/>• Professional translation into English: ca. $ 2.500,-<br/>• Marketing: ca. $ 1.000,- thanks to connections and networking<br/><br/>If I don't reach my funding goal, I will finish my story anyway, I'm just going to have to find ways of publishing it via PDF or Kindle instead of hard copies. If there is money left, I will have it translated, too.<br/>I plan on finishing my book in 2013.</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>As a graphic designer, I will design for you. Please have a look at the perks.

<h3>Make or Break</h3>
<p>2012 marks the breaking point in my life. It has been as intense as I have never experienced it before, as I am wrting these words I still cannot believe the pain and the happiness I went through in the past ten months. For the most part, it seemed that my complete faith in finding ""the one"" was rewarded, yet recently clouds of doubt have appeared across the horizon. Small clouds, but still. In my attempt to uncover the truth to blow them away, I feel like this year could be ""my year"".<br/>I will not sugar coat anything that has happened to me. I am devoted to honesty, and you as future readers will experience that devotion first hand. I will however change the names of the people involved.<br/><br/>My goal is not to get rich by publishing this story. I just want to tell it.<br/><br/><strong>Honesty</strong><br/><br/>This isn't some elaborate con to promote myself as a graphic designer.

<p> Hey there!  This “Baby Boomer” Grandmother with no retirement provision (recently laid off from a church office secretarial &amp; editorial position, no unemployment benefits) needs your help to apply her BA degree in English, summa cum laude and secure the financial means for fulfilling a lifelong ambition of writing her first children’s  book: <strong>The Tiniest Bird &amp; Biggest Best Birdhouse in the West</strong> and author the first of an already researched series of children’s bird books that will be based on the multi-level Montessori educational model; over a century ago Dr. Maria Montessori theorized then proved:<strong> “the brain is hand-made”. </strong>From their earliest years, <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">children instinctively begin giving expression to what they tangibly experience with every one of their five senses</span></em> ~ and a sixth ~ wonder~ that adults usually lose sight of in their scramble to survive in today’s world.  Sadly, children are also increasingly deprived of this naturally enjoyable birthright! At each sensitive stage of a child’s human development there must be many absorbing activities for their:</p>
<ul>
<li>hands’ construction</li>
<li>eyes’ curiosity</li>
<li>mind’s imagination</li>
<li>ears’ attunement</li>
<li>body’s movement</li>
<li>heart’s song  </li>
</ul>
<p>My book will stimulate development of these senses which together foster advancement of early literacy skills, pro-social skills, and abstract thinking/problem solving skills, fine arts and music appreciation.  The very root of storytelling springs from the universal need for companionship and consolation.  Many respected sociologists researching the origin of life have placed the need to tell and hear stories second in necessity only to physical hunger!  <strong>Storytelling ~ if made FUN for all concerned ~ is one of the most powerful motivations for children to read!</strong></p>
<p>The first book (title above) in my intended series will provide an interactive, unique format that will happily engage the child multi-generationally with siblings, parents and caretakers ~ each and all of whom will be gauging the youngster’s comprehension by what the child is challenged TO DO WITH THEM in response to what has been related on each page via the narrative words, interspersed with song, illustration, and poetry!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>My book project goal</strong><strong>: $9,500.<br/></strong>Estimated time is 6 months after end of fundraising campaign to write and self-publish this first book.</p>

<p><strong>How this project evolved: </strong>I’ve daily cohabited in all seasons with a variety of beautiful birds and more formidable wildlife such as bear and cougar having lived ‘green’ or off-the-grid with my artist husband for over 15 years on a remote alpine meadow nestled between the San Isabel Natl. Forest to the East and the Sangre de Cristo Mts. to the West. The birds’ beauty and behavior has been my favorite subject of observation, research, photography, and journaling. My  bird-characters of various species will work out with quirky humor, goofs, guidance, adventures, and growing self-esteem ‘the real stuff’ of their individuality and inter-connected, earth- existence in ways children can discover, identify, and do something with ~ pleasurably, creatively, constructively ~  interacting with their peers and parents. I’m convinced that the emergent 21<sup>st</sup> generation of children is largely not hearing the good news that each of them is a unique marvel capable of creating, instead of destroying, life on this planet; they’re bombarded daily by multi-media bad news and violence. Pablo Casals famously said forty years ago: “There is not another child exactly like<em> you</em>.  Look at your body~ what a wonder it is! …You have the capacity for anything.  Yes, you are a marvel.  And when you grow up, can you then harm another, who is like you, a unique marvel?” This present book project has become more personally compelling in the wake of the recent, ghastly Newtown tragedy that took place in my native state, CT. </p>
<p>My observations and motivations for launching this book project can also be traced to a block of undergraduate studies on early childhood education, subsequent Montessori teacher training and classroom experience, writing/ directing a community after-school program in dramatic arts, and presenting a bevy of original workshops over the years.   </p>
<p><strong>Summary:  </strong>Your help funding this author is about more than just another children’s book or this specific project. Funding will enable this 66 year old grandmother to live and write/work from home in a remote mountain location where there are virtually ‘no jobs’ in this small town and a round-trip commute is 3 hrs.to the nearest city with a descent of several thousand feet along a dangerous mountain pass<strong>. </strong>Since the housing market crash in 2008, nearly every other local property is ‘for sale’ and a typical house can take up to a decade to sell. Self-employment in our hand-crafted off-the-grid home is my only option for a productive future.</p>
<p><strong>I’ll be forever grateful for all contributions and if you can’t contribute money, please ask a couple of your friends it they can help out.</strong></p>
</div></div>","Hey there!  This “Baby Boomer” Grandmother with no retirement provision (recently laid off from a church office secretarial & editorial position, no unemployment benefits) needs your help to apply her BA degree in English, summa cum laude and secure the financial means for fulfilling a lifelong ambition of writing her first children’s  book: The Tiniest Bird & Biggest Best Birdhouse in the West and author the first of an already researched series of children’s bird books that will be based on the multi-level Montessori educational model; over a century ago Dr. Maria Montessori theorized then proved: “the brain is hand-made”. From their earliest years, children instinctively begin giving expression to what they tangibly experience with every one of their five senses ~ and a sixth ~ wonder~ that adults usually lose sight of in their scramble to survive in today’s world.  Sadly, children are also increasingly deprived of this naturally enjoyable birthright! At each sensitive stage of a child’s human development there must be many absorbing activities for their:

hands’ construction
eyes’ curiosity
mind’s imagination
ears’ attunement
body’s movement
heart’s song  

My book will stimulate development of these senses which together foster advancement of early literacy skills, pro-social skills, and abstract thinking/problem solving skills, fine arts and music appreciation.  The very root of storytelling springs from the universal need for companionship and consolation.  Many respected sociologists researching the origin of life have placed the need to tell and hear stories second in necessity only to physical hunger!  Storytelling ~ if made FUN for all concerned ~ is one of the most powerful motivations for children to read!
The first book (title above) in my intended series will provide an interactive, unique format that will happily engage the child multi-generationally with siblings, parents and caretakers ~ each and all of whom will be gauging the youngster’s comprehension by what the child is challenged TO DO WITH THEM in response to what has been related on each page via the narrative words, interspersed with song, illustration, and poetry!
 
My book project goal: $9,500.Estimated time is 6 months after end of fundraising campaign to write and self-publish this first book.

<p>Mi nombre es Roberto Retana y soy el creador de Pizza Oliva. Pizza Oliva nació en Costa Rica con una inversión muy pequeña y mucho trabajo. </p>
<p>Comencé el negocio con exactamente 1200 dólares y una tarjeta de crédito. Como tuve la oportunidad de estudiar administración de negocios, pude utilizar esos conocimientos para gestionar correctamente mi emprendimiento y lograr que esta creciera aunque fuese lentamente.</p>
<p>Pizza Oliva ha crecido y actualmente da trabajo a 5 personas incluyéndome. Pasamos de tener una sola pizzeria a tener dos. Esta vez, nuestro objetivo es llegar a abrir una pizzería estilo Napolitano que requiere equipos especializados, ingredientes importados y mucha disciplina para hacer las cosas siguiendo la tradición Napolitana.  Nuestro objetivo es poder ofrecer más productos que los que actualmente se ofrecemos y dar una experiencia completamente diferente. Adicionalmente queremos desarrollar e implementar una oferta de gelato Italiano, lo cuál requiere de equipo especial.</p>
<p>Aún falta mucho para llegar a lograrlo pero abrir un restaurante en vez de una ventanita de productos para llevar, es un paso en la dirección correcta. Desde que abrimos nuestro concepto ha sido el de ofrecer pizza express o para llevar. Actualmente este proyecto lo estamos realizando con el dinero que hemos podido capitalizar durante todo este tiempo. Sin embargo, estamos requiriendo un poco más para poder llevar a cabo la visión exacta de lo que queremos hacer.</p>
<p>Hemos logrado formar un equipo de personas dedicadas que me acompañan en esto y a quienes hemos podido dar la oportunidad de tener un trabajo.</p>
<p>Nuestro nuevo restaurante se encuentra en San José en el barrio La California frente al Parque Nacional, flanqueado por la estación de trenes al Atlantico y la asamblea legislativa.</p>
<p>El nuevo local representa la oportunidad de ampliar la gama de productos que podemos ofrecer y adicionalmente crear más puestos de trabajo a tiempo completo. Tenemos ya 2 personas que han luchado duro y con pasión para salir adelante. Gente con pasión es lo que necesitamos. En ambos casos son jóvenes y con deseos de estudiar y trabajar. </p>
<p>La zona de San José donde se encontrará el restaurante contará con una nueva opción gastronómica y con nuestra inversión contribuiremos a la rehabilitación del centro de San José. El restaurante ofrecerá la posibilidad de poder realizar actividades culturales como exposiciones artísticas o la presentación de músicos solistas.</p>
<p>Financiamiento</p>
<p>En este momento solo estamos necesitando 6000 dólares USD los cuales serán destinados a la compra de los equipos necesarios para ampliar la nueva oferta de productos la cuál incluye gelato o helado estilo italiano y bases de pizza las cuales podremos ofrecer a otros negocios con los cuales queremos crear nuevos encadenamientos.</p>
<p>Actualmente tenemos en espera 3 clientes. Con su donación o ayuda al compartir por las redes sociales nuestra campaña, nosotros podremos acercarnos a nuestro objetivo. </p>
<p>A todas aquellas personas que apoyen nuestra causa, les estaremos dando a cambio distintos productos conmemorativos. Entre ellos están tazas de café conmemorativas, camisetas conmemorativas, tarjetas VIP de descuento que le otorgarán un 25% de sus compras durante un año o incluso, la posibilidad de dejar una huella en nuestro restaurante al tener su nombre en alguna de nuestras mesas como tributo a su ayuda y con ello ser parte de nuestra historia.</p>
<p><strong>Impacto</strong></p>
<p>Con su ayuda podremos crear nuevos puestos de trabajo para personas que desean  desempeñarse en area de la gastronomía. Eventualmente el número de empleos directos e indirectos puede incrementar y por lo tanto, su donación ayudará a crear empleo. </p>
<p>Actualmente Pizza Oliva es un lugar de encuentro de amigos y nosotros podemos decir que tenemos un impacto sobre la comunidad en los lugares donde operamos ya que las personas interactúan y se encuentran, se conocen, comparten lo cual termina reforzando los valores comunitarios.</p>
<p>El area de San José donde se encuentra nuestro futuro restaurante, ya cuenta con la propuesta gastronómica de otros negocios como Café Miel, Maza Bistró, Manos en la Masa, Sana Sana, Yummy Lab y la Ventanita Meraki. Creemos firmemente que con la apertura de nuestro negocio, estaremos ayudando a crear toda una nueva zona de importancia económica y gastronómica e incluso fortalecerla.</p>
<p>Finalmente, a raíz de mi emprendimiento me ví expuesto a muchas personas que me buscaban para pedirme ayuda y consejo de como comenzar un negocio. Durante estos años me he formado como consultor y coach para emprendedores. El restaurante se estará acondicionando adicionalmente para poder realizar talleres y capacitaciones para personas que deseen emprender y así tener las herramientas necesarias para hacerlo con éxito. Al alcanzar el objetivo podremos llevar a cabo todo esto y contamos realizar estos talleres en coordinación con distintas organizaciones que buscan promover el emprendimiento exitoso, sobre todo en familias de escasos recursos y así ayudar a disminuir el subempleo y empleo informal. </p>
<p> <strong>Riesgos y retos</strong></p>
<p>Los retos son muchos, pero como lo hemos hecho otras veces, hemos logrado salir adelante creando empleo y productos que nuestros clientes disfrutan. </p>
<p>En los riesgos no pensamos mucho ya que estos siempre existen naturalmente en cualquier negocio. Y la verdad, somos positivos así que sabemos desde ya, que esto va funcionar. Ahora, el financiamiento aportado por todos los que nos apoyen, ayudarán a reducir justamente, los riesgos que implica el financiarse mediante créditos los cuales a veces no están disponibles para las PYMES ni tampoco se adaptan a sus necesidades debido a las requisitos que requieren y la tasa de interés.</p>
<p>Nuestra experiencia previa de 5 años en este negocio y el hecho de que trabajamos ordenadamente, llevando libros contables, nos ha permitido simular, formular y evaluar nuestro modelo de negocio, permitiéndonos entender cuales son las areas clave de desempeño que tenemos que alcanzar para poder tener éxito. </p>
<p>Finalmente, usted puede apoyar nuestra campaña compartiéndola con sus amigos y familiares. Estamos seguros que alguno de ellos ya nos conoce y estará muy feliz de saber cuales son los nuevos retos que estamos asumiendo y la nueva aventura que esto representa. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Melissa Nelson Lowe and I'm the daughter and co-author of the Sugar Alpha series. I am a professional skydiver with  11,000+ skydives and 18 world records. This book is about the incredible stories of my late father, Roger Nelson, a skydiving pioneer, and  a well-known drug smuggler. </p>
<p>The completion of this campaign signifies the completion of the Sugar Alpha series. Taking on this project has been emotionally trying as I figured out many mysteries of my childhood. Finishing this project would be a huge emotional relief, and my contribution to my family, preserving OUR history, and essentially - a piece of skydiving history!</p>
<p>Although Volume 2 doesn't end with my dad's last breath, it is the last part of his life he wrote about. Your support will help me complete the journey publishing my dad's story.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have spent just under a decade working on this project out of my own pocket, and my own time. The monies raised will be for the final publication stages and to pay back the already-incurred expenses shown below.</p>
<p>The baseline goal is $10,000. However the campaign allows for more contributions. Any additional funds will be used towards creating audio books and continue to work on making this series a movie! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489549235/n94ofparywiy35rhl397.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The campaign will be an inclusive journey in the publishing process and more personal than just buying the book on Amazon. Each supporter will be asked to participate in voting for the official title of Volume 2, approve author images, and vote on the cover artwork, and other things along the way! </p>
<p>I also believe in giving back to supporters in contributing to the campaign! Therefore, I've created a BONUS BOOK ""Volume 3"" dust jacket comprised of a few of my dad's original handwritten memoirs, dozens of photos, newspaper articles, indictment statements and more! This bonus book is <strong>EXCLUSIVE</strong> to the campaign supporters and <strong>WILL NOT</strong> be for sale to the general public. <i>The only exception is for me selling any remaining copies during the physical launch in Chicago.</i></p>
<p><i>I have a hunch that we'll reach the goal of $10,000, however if we do not, the funds will still go into the final phases of book publication. </i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Sugar Alpha is a great piece of the often unspoken parts of skydiving history. Sugar Alpha Volume 1 sold over 3,000 copies in its first week and made it to Amazon's Top 10 Best Seller's list of new arrivals. Finally, it is preserving my family's history, and a tiny snippet of skydiving history. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Process</h3>
<p><strong>PHASE 1</strong> - Write the book <i><u>Done!</u></i></p>
<p><strong>PHASE 2</strong> - Edit the book  <i><u>Editing last chapter as I write this!</u></i></p>
<p><strong>PHASE 3</strong> - <i><u>Digitized documents &amp; photos completed. Beginning to start assembling Volume 3 into book form.</u></i></p>
<p><strong>PHASE 4</strong> - Design mock cover artwork <u><i>Done!</i></u></p>
<p><strong>PHASE 5</strong> - Launch Indiegogo <i><u>Boom! Here it is!</u></i></p>
<p><strong>PHASE 6</strong> - Final publication process for Volume 2 &amp; 3 <u><i>Waiting on completion of Phase 2 &amp; 3, then off to publishers!</i></u></p>
<p>The official physical launch is scheduled for Summerfest at Skydive Chicago on August 3rd, 2017! </p>

</div><b>Greetings , my name is Marquis H.K.</b>  <b> I've been involved in the Australian underground hardcore punk and metal scene for over thirty years . My journey has been an interesting one to say the least so I decided to document it into a compelling autobiographical account titled Thirty Years Of Anger .  By contributing to this campaign you will help in getting this important piece of Australian history out to the world . </b><br/><br/><b>What We Need And What You Get</b><br/><br/>My target is to raise $5.000 AUD  . This will cover the cost of the publishing and the book which will sell for $29.95 AUD  and also shipping both national and international . If the desired target is not reached all funds will go towards the publishing of the book and you in turn as a contributor will still receive a signed copy .

</h3>
<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Hi! My name is Rosalyn. My closest friends call me RozzyPie. </span>
</h3>
<p><b>The RozzyPie story begins with me growing up as a young girl in the Philippines. </b>My favourite childhood memory was going to the markets with my mother and then cooking up a storm in the kitchen. (The picture above shows me and my mom visiting one of these markets 25 years later.) <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I would marvel at the abundant feast we </span>have created<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. Sharing food with my family at dinner was a time when I felt all was well and
life was good and abundant.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>When I was 12 years old, my family immigrated to Canada. </b>Overnight, my life completely changed. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Suddenly there were no more markets.
Instead it was replaced by Safeway. Suddenly there was no more cooking
up a storm in the kitchen. Instead it was replaced by my sister and I fumbling our way around the kitchen. My mom still cooked some traditional foods but increasingly, our
diet Westernized, and the gap between me and my culture of origin grew larger.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>While I felt disconnected from my culture of origin, I embraced my new journey of self-discovery and carving my own path. </b>I
made life and career choices that my parents did not understand, and it
led to massive conflict between us. After graduating from university, I left my parents' home to take a job in a different city. </p>
<p>Shortly after, I developed food allergies.
The stress of a new city, a new job, and my parents’ disapproval had affected
my most vital organs – my digestion. I had to completely alter how I ate. A naturopath advised that I adopt a gluten-free and dairy-free diet. In order to give my tummy
time to heal, I had to be very gentle and eat foods that won’t irritate my
delicate digestive tract.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>About a year after I became gluten-free and
dairy-free, I met one of my best foodie friends, Samantha. When we met at a
dinner party, one of our first topics of our conversation was about
food.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1094880/files/20141214012611-IMG_1349.JPG?1418549171"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I learned she was Jewish-American born and
raised in Southern California. I was Filipino-born Chinese Canadian and we had
more in common in our culinary tastes and stories than anyone else in our
entire life. Right then and there, a special bond was born. We called each other
“food soul mates”.</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Samantha’s mom was equally passionate about
food, and before I knew it, I was spending two to three nights a week making and having dinner in their
home . </p>
<p><b>Since I didn’t have family close by,
they adopted me into their family. </b>They had an extended family of siblings,
children and grandchildren, and aunts and uncles. They called me RozzyPie. I
called them my Island family, as this was in the city of Victoria off the coast of British Columbia. I had found home again,
at least what felt something like home. </p>
<p>During these dinners we exchanged stories
and recipes from our childhood, and it warmed my heart to have found beauty and
kinship in our shared transcultural heritage. </p>
<p>While cooking miso-crusted salmon, or black
beans with turkey sausage over brown rice, or enjoying the most delicious rack
of lamb for Seder, we formed a bond that reminded me of those childhood days
shopping at the wet markets and cooking with my mother. </p>
<p><b>Six years is a long time to have very
little meaningful contact with my mother. </b>In 2011, I decided to return to Vancouver to become an
entrepreneur. There were better business opportunities here, and I missed my
mom. I wanted to reconnect with her and heal the pain surrounding our
estrangement.</p>
<p>It took me a year after returning to
Vancouver to actually see my mom for the first time in almost 7 years. </p>
<p><b>I began visiting her every other
weekend, and each time I would ask her to cook a dish that I craved from my
childhood. </b>She would do so every single time. And I was pleasantly surprised to
discover that she had adopted healthier eating habits as well. In between pork
bone and lotus root soups and chicken congee, she would also serve me chia
seeds on gluten-free cereal. </p>
<p><b>The first time I tasted a home-cooked meal
she made, my body cried and sang at the same time. </b>It was as though I had
satiated a hunger that I didn’t know existed. It wasn’t just about the food. It
was about the memories, it was about the mother-daughter connection, lost and
found, and it was about finally understanding my mother’s language of love. </p>
<p><b>Food is love.</b></p>

<p>Two years passed since I returned to
Vancouver, and I missed my best friend, my food soul mate, and my Island
family. </p>
<p>Somewhere deep inside me, I had a desire to
write about my culinary experiences and share them with my food soul mate. I
started my blog <a href=""http://www.rozzypie.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rozzypie.com </a>in January 2014 simply as a way to share my

Hi! My name is Rosalyn. My closest friends call me RozzyPie.

<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>I will be writing two pages every day for 6 months starting in August. These pages will become an adult Science Fiction novel. I decided to give you a chance to read the novel as it's being written. If you choose to kick-start my novel and select the $45 reward, then you will receive 14 pages a week through the mail for 6 months. Because I don't want to add to cutting down more trees, the paper, envelopes, and post cards you receive will be made from 100% recycled paper. With the first envelope there will be a short introduction so that you know what kind of world you are about to enter. There will also be a thank you letter from me for backing my project. </p>
<p>If you become one of the people receiving the pages through the mail, then you will also get access to a private blog where you can share your opinions about the novel as you read it. I might even incorporate some of your suggestions into the final edited version of the book! </p>
<p>If you decide that reading 14 pages a week isn't for you, then you might want to pre order the book instead. By the time you get your copy it will be the final edited version. </p>
<p>You can also support my project and get rewarded with a postcard with the cover art on the front. Maybe you or someone you know lives in Boston and will enjoy my version of the sign. </p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>It is the year 2035 and the world has drastically changed since the Apocalypse of  2018. An unknown virus that spread rapidly killed more than half of the world's human population and 100% of all animals. This virus made all of the animal products that were left completely inedible causing some to turn to eating bugs or... cannibalism. In order to maintain some type of stable society, the brilliant but twisted scientist Dr. Samson developed a way to quickly grow human clones to be used as a source of meat. With the president on his side, they created a strict way of life where you are either with them or you will be banished or killed instantly. Not everyone agreed with this way of life. Some saw the eating of clones as no different than eating the originals so they fled from the cities to live their lives as fugitives. It's a hard way of surviving, which puts them in the same land as brutally violent rogues and cannibalistic psychopaths. </p>
<p>Sadie, the daughter of the world's most famous scientist Dr. Samson and the Governor of Massachusetts Jaden Samson, was raised in the glamorous world of the clone eaters not knowing of a different way of life. Join her as she discovers the dark side of her family's business and makes choices that will change her life forever.</p>

<h3>Why Back This Project</h3>
<p>This novel has been in my head for the past 7 years and I'd like to finally make it happen. Nothing will inspire me more to start and finish this novel than an audience - people who are willing to take a chance and read the novel as it's being made, or pre order the finished product. The money made from pre orders will go toward me getting the novel edited by a professional and self publishing it. Luckily I have a lot of experience with making book covers for others and as you can see I've already made one that I like. </p>
<p>I hope that this book makes people think more about what they eat and where their food comes from. I can't wait to see how it turns out and I hope to see it become a movie someday! </p>
<p>Copyrighted material ISBN-13: 978-1477670941</p>
<p>Thank you to all who back my project. I hope you enjoy what you read and I know I'll enjoy writing it. </p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</strong></p>
<p>J.W. Glaze was born on March 21, 1970 in east Texas. During his younger years he traveled across the country with his family, visiting and even living in many states across America, with his parents and younger sister; he now resides in Texas with his wife and children. Home schooled by his parents most of his life, he often wrote short stories and accompanied by his own art work he attempted to put his thoughts into words.</p>
<p>During his youth he made frequent trips to the Theater and Library. Some of his favorite works are J.R.R. Tolkien’s ""The Hobbit"" and ""Lord of the Rings"", Frank Herbert’s ""Dune"", George Lucas’ ""Star Wars"", C.H. Lewis’ ""Chronicals of Narnia"", the various works of Tamora Pierce and Gene Roddenberry to name a few, and assorted graphic novels written by Marvel, D.C., and various independents.</p>
<p>Growing up in the eighties he listened to a variety of music, but composed music ignited his imagination and helped him to focus on his writing. He often listened to the various works of John Williams and Danny Elfman while writing Warstorms ""Emergence"". The final battle of Warstorms ""Emergence"" was written while listening to ""The Brazilian"", by Genesis.</p>
<p>The story of Warstorms began as the daydreams of a young man. The love of mystic tales and technological advances led him to craft a novel that he would enjoy reading. The project began as a hobby; he never intended to be published. He took a month to plot out the beginning saga, then sat at his desk and began writing in a notebook.</p>
<p>When he reached the end, he transferred the work to his computer, where most of Warstorms ""Emergence"" was written, although he sometimes found that the story flowed better when he wrote by hand.</p>
<p>All the characters in Warstorms ""Emergence"" are from J.W. Glaze’s imagination and are loosely based on family, friends, and people he met throughout his travels. It took him three months to write the first draft of Warstorms ""Emergence"" and two and a half years to revise it before giving it to his family and friends to read.</p>
<p>He decided to self-publish the book and so a third year was spent with another round of edits. While this was being done he began to design a cover, typeset the manuscript, and create marketing materials. During this time he also drew the map for Warstorms ""Emergence"".</p>
<p>Finally, the manuscript was sent to press, and the first books arrived.</p>
<p><strong>PROLOGUE</strong></p>
<p>“Between the light and shadow”</p>
<p>In the beginning there was only empty space and darkness. Within the darkness life evolved. It was life at its most primal. Survival was its only concern, the stronger feeding on the weaker.</p>
<p>Then from an unexplainable arcane source, light appeared. Darkness was shattered. Those creatures of the dark cursed the light and the new wisdom and understanding it brought.</p>
<p>The light exposed the distinctions between void and existence, shadows and luminosity, anonymity and revelation, ignorance and enlightenment. Wherever the light glowed thoughts formed and from these thoughts philosophies were born. Endless possibilities were envisioned. The methods to bring these visions into being were created and from these creations a multi-verse of realities was born.</p>
<p>The creatures of the dark recoiled into the nether reaches of the universe, as far from the light as they could hide. This region became known as the abyss. Those who made it their dwelling warred against one another struggling for dominance over the darkness. Thousands of years pass as their epic battles raged throughout the abyss until finally one group emerges victorious, the Yar’goth. These powerful, mystical creatures dripped with the primordial energies that saturated everything within and beyond this universe. They absorbed into themselves all those that opposed them until none but the Yar’goth remained.</p>
<p>Once their control of the abyss was secured they turned their attentions to those outside their domain. Pouring from this void like spilt ink flows across a blank page they consumed all in their path. Entire cultures, civilizations and star systems were completely absorbed or annihilated by the Yar’goth. Those allowed to live are forced to do the bidding of these dark masters.</p>
<p>The Yar’goth grew arrogant, coming to believe that they were unstoppable. By the time they had conquered over three quarters of the universe they even dared to call themselves gods.</p>
<p>Then they appeared, defenders of the light’s path. They were called the Eldicron, a race who had arisen on the far side of the universe furthest away from the grasp of the dark creatures. At first they had embraced the mystical ways of the universe. Dissatisfied with the inability to predict the precise outcomes of their mysticism they found a different means to advance their species. They called it science.</p>
<p>Armed with this knowledge they created massive war machines and weapons that were equal in capabilities to any mystical powers. As their technology increased so did their ability to leave their world. They were driven by their desire to convert the entire universe to their own form of honor, absolute justice and technical skills.</p>
<p>As the two opposing forces spread throughout the cosmos it was inevitable that an encounter would ensue. The Yar’goth and the Eldicron begin to rival for the center of the universe.</p>
<p>Each recognizes the true nature of their opponent; the Yar’goth being creatures of the dark, cold and self-absorbed while the Eldicron are creatures of enlightenment, believing that they are honor bound to bring absolute justice and technology to the entire universe.</p>
<p>Thus an intergalactic war of epic proportions is sparked as the two titanic races engage in wave after wave of bloody battles. Equally matched in strength neither is able to maintain the upper hand for long periods of time.</p>
<p>Their war would possibly still be raging even to this day if not for the internal deterioration of the Yar’goth Empire. With all their forces concentrating on the front lines the races on their outer borders begin to cast off the shackles of the Yar’goth’s oppression. The Yar’goth found it necessary to deploy forces to put down the insurrection thus weakening their position against the Eldicron.</p>
<p>The Yar’goth retreated to an uncharted sector of the universe to regroup and wait for stability to be restored within their realms. As they linger in this region they plan their next strategic move, a surprise attack on the Eldicron home world.</p>
<p>But before reinforcements could arrive their enemy discovered them. Knowing that a battle in space would only weaken their position the Yar’goth place their vulnerable troops upon a small green world in hopes of making a stand against the Eldicron until replacements arrive.</p>
<p>The Eldicron pursued the Yar’goth to the planet’s surface with assault troops, massive weapons and war machines. The din of the battle attracts the attention of the inhabitants of this planet, a world known to its people as Pasteil.</p>
<p>Watching in fascination two clans of Pasteilians gathered on cliffs overlooking the conflict between the two factions. Observing the conflict on the Yar’goth’s side of the battlefield is the clan house of Phe. As Phe and his people observe and mimic the strange mystical techniques wielded by the Yar’goth the clan house of Zenta, on the opposite side of the battlefield, are</p>
<p>observing the Eldicron and their scientific actions, measures and countermeasures.</p>
<p>When the war finally comes to an end, with the Eldicron emerging victorious, the Yar’goth are eliminated to the last entity. The Eldicron forces leave Pasteil, never to return.</p>
<p>On the world of Pasteil the two clan houses, using what they have learned, quickly become the two most dominate houses of their world. Within a single century both lay claim to their own half of Pasteil. The two houses live in relative peace for over a hundred generations.</p>
<p>At the end of this peaceful time the house of Zenta makes an announcement of catastrophic proportion. They claim to have uncovered the source of the great and powerful mystical forces that flow throughout the universe. Not only do they claim to know the origin but also they allege to have found a way to direct or even halt its ebb and flow thus giving them absolute control over the mystical forces of the multi-verse.</p>
<p>Enraged the mystical leaders of the house of Phe launched a sneak attack against the house of Zenta decimating them in a single strike. Some that survived went into hiding but most struck back. Their attempts were futile and all were imprisoned, slain or, the worse possible retribution, banishment. Any who dared to study science and technology are branded as heretics and banished into the void of space.</p>
<p>With science and technology destroyed on Pasteil the elders of the house of Phe’ decide the time has come to move out into the universe so that their powers and influence could grow. This endeavor will also give them an opportunity to find and subdue anyone from the house of Zenta’ that might have escaped. No one must be allowed to discover the secrets of the Zenta house.</p>
<p>Five-millennium pass and the Pasteilians influence stretches over all but the most remote parts of the universe. A small exploration ship discovers the home world of the Eldicron. They report that the Eldicron glory is now but a shadow of its former self. They observe from space that this once powerful empire has been reduced to two warring factions.</p>
<p>The planet surface itself is scorched black from constant war and conflict. It was covered with vast volcanic regions caused by unimaginable weapons of mass destruction. It was barely able to sustain life. The planet’s two moons had become large space</p>
<p>fortresses; one housing the skelicron lead by Tai’gi, eldest son of Zarakhan, the other is home to the Licron lead by Kyo’kuji, younger son of Zarakhan.</p>
<p>When the expedition returns and reports its findings fear is struck in the minds of the Pasteilians leaders known as the Alkar. Their leader, Lord Phe’eh’shi’wa, decides that the threat of either faction gaining control and thus repeating their pattern of universal domination is too great to be allowed.</p>
<p>The leaders knew that if they attacked the Eldicron home world head on that the two factions could decide to unite to fight a common enemy. Therefore they devise a plan whereby they remove the Eldicron as a threat without fear of reprisal. It was decided that Lord Phe’eh’shi’wa himself should execute the plan.</p>
<p>Lord Phe’eh’shi’wa’s ship arrived on the outer regions of the planetary system. From this position his ship launched millions of tiny crystals throughout the system. Each crystal was encrusted with a single rune.</p>
<p>While Lord Phe’eh’shi’wa enumerated hundreds of incantations these crystals begin to orbit the star system. As Phe’eh’shi’wa increased the strength of his spells the crystals above the planet and its two moons began to glow with power.</p>
<p>“Through the ebb and flow of the great mystic stream, between the Abyss and the light that forges us all, I command you, depart never to return!”</p>
<p>With this final command the light of the crystal enveloped the planet and surrounding area. A brilliant flash explodes in an implosion wave and all are gone.</p>
<p>Upon Lord Phe’eh’shi’wa’s return to Pasteil all herald him as a hero and a legend. Parades, monuments and houses of learning were erected in his honor. After centuries of service to the Pasteilians people Lord Phe’eh’shi’wa retired to fade into obscurity. From that day forward he could be found at the Pasteilian academy teaching future generations</p></div>","Hello, my name is J.W. Glaze auther of Warstorms ""Emergence"".

Lord Phe’eh’shi’wa’s ship arrived on the outer regions of the planetary system. From this position his ship launched millions of tiny crystals throughout the system. Each crystal was encrusted with a single rune.
While Lord Phe’eh’shi’wa enumerated hundreds of incantations these crystals begin to orbit the star system. As Phe’eh’shi’wa increased the strength of his spells the crystals above the planet and its two moons began to glow with power.
“Through the ebb and flow of the great mystic stream, between the Abyss and the light that forges us all, I command you, depart never to return!”
With this final command the light of the crystal enveloped the planet and surrounding area. A brilliant flash explodes in an implosion wave and all are gone.
Upon Lord Phe’eh’shi’wa’s return to Pasteil all herald him as a hero and a legend. Parades, monuments and houses of learning were erected in his honor. After centuries of service to the Pasteilians people Lord Phe’eh’shi’wa retired to fade into obscurity. From that day forward he could be found at the Pasteilian academy teaching future generations",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Wedding Z: How to Reimagine Weddings for the Next Generation.</i><br/>Generation Z, the generation after millennials, is going to shake up the wedding industry. With Gen Z’s unique approach to culture, technology, sustainability, and more, cutting-edge leaders in the wedding industry are reimagining their products and services to appeal to this generation.<br/><br/>My name is Breanna Decker and I am the author of Wedding Z. I wrote this book because I could see that my generation, Generation Z, was starting to make big changes in the wedding industry and I wanted to learn more.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how Gen Z’s influence is impacting all consumer sectors and be inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit of those in the wedding industry. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for weddings in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you plan your wedding differently.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the ins-and-outs of Generation Z's consumer habits and how the wedding industry is approaching things differently from a creative perspective.<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing Generation Z is going to be different and challenging. Wedding vendors need to sell themselves, their background, their expertise, and their experience to Gen Z, who demand authenticity, customization, and more.</li>
<li>Learning the values of Generation Z and understanding how they influence their consumer decisions will either make your wedding-related biz a success or a failure.</li>
<li>The bottom line is you must embrace and jump on the wave that Gen Z is creating in this industry, or your business will not be able to serve the rising target market.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are a wedding vendor wanting to stay relevant in this changing industry or are a bride to be looking for inspiration on how to plan your wedding differently.<br/><br/>Wedding Z is a non-fiction book that speaks to brides-to-be and wedding vendors who are looking at Generation Z’s influence on wedding trends and who truly want to approach weddings differently for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - Wedding Z: Reimagine Weddings for the Next Generation</h2>

These chapters tell my personal history in the wedding industry, and explain my heart for starting on my journey to empower brides and vendors with connections and knowledge. I also walk you through the changing industry, which leads to Generation Z being in the spotlight.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 3-8. In these chapters, I introduce Generation Z and examine how they approach topics such as sustainability, technology, diversity, and culture and how these values impact their view on the wedding industry.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 9-15. These chapters look at influential, cutting-edge companies and vendors within the wedding industry such as Zola, Hope Taylor Photography, Laurie Hartwell The Bridal Society, and more. These companies are aligning their missions and values with the new expectations and markets of a new generation, making them extremely successful industry leaders.<br/><br/>Part 4, Chapter 16-19, are reflections from my prospective as a wedding industry professional. This industry presents its own unique challenges, and these chapters examine opportunity cost, unforeseen struggles, and a behind-the-scenes look and reflections at what wedding professional could do differently, from someone who is in the day-in and day-out of the grind of the industry.</p>

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.
Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #[WeddingGenZ] and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press so we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page
Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it. Please do this as a text message or Direct Message on social media.
Thank you so much of all of your love and support!Thanks again,Breanna Decker",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>My Story</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Hi! I'm Jeff Chiba Stearns and I am a storyteller &amp; illustrator. </strong>I am also an award-winning and Emmy nominated animation filmmaker best known for the films <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IeSqVboADw"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Yellow Sticky Notes</i></a> and <a href=""https://vimeo.com/179551767"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Mixed Match</i></a>!</p>
<p>Since having kids, I've directed my attention to creating children's books that will inspire both my son and daughter. </p>
<p>I created my first children's book <a href=""https://www.meditatingbunny.com/product-page/mixed-critters"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Mixed Critters</i></a> so that my mixed Japanese daughter could see herself reflected in animals like her, mixed! </p>

<h3><strong>Nori and His Delicious Dreams - The Story</strong></h3>
<p><strong>For my next children's book, <i>Nori and His Delicious Dreams, </i></strong>I've combined two of my favourite things, <strong>eating and sleeping!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The main character, Nori</strong>, is a mixed Japanese toddler with an insatiable appetite who dreams of sleeping on beds made of delectable dishes. The book is an exploration of culinary delights from around the globe that is sure to excite the appetites of all your little ones through colourful illustrations and playful rhymes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571818631/j5yskyrqzbrhhluhpwjc.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571818630/m4pfeiweadgqluuxk0m1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The inspiration for the book </strong>came when I was in high school. A friend kept mentioning how comfortable it would be to sleep in a warm chicken sandwich. It sounded kind of weird but the visual of this never left my imagination. Now, 20 years later, <i>Nori and His Delicious Dreams</i> was born!  </p>

<p>The Words Matter project is bringing area writers, artists and performers together. Four groups of Mid-South creatives have been putting together four multimedia works that will be presented on Friday, October 4, at the Marshall Arts Gallery, 639 Marshall Ave.</p>
<p>This is an event where process and product will be on display. Each of the four projects began with words -- a literary contribution from a writer. From there, a combination of artists and performers extended that creation in their own media -- visual artists, musicians, dancers, actors and filmmakers found collective expression from the language. </p>
<p>Memphis has been making some bold and unusual collaborations across artistic disciplines and we want to be part of and encourage that. </p>
<p>Other than the project starting with the written word, there were no rules. The artists were free to do their art. </p>
<p>On Oct. 4 at Marshall Arts, we'll have a party where you can see what the groups have done, visit with the artists, and experience what some of our town's top talent does when, as Neil Gaiman puts it, they make good art. </p>

Después de 4 años enseñando herramientas y estrategias para encontrar trabajo, he decidido trasladar todo el conocimiento adquirido a un sencillo libro.
La idea es trasladar todo lo que pueda de lo que enseño en el taller, mis conferencias y los blogs; a una estructura fácil de leer y muy completa.
Usted puede hacer parte de esta iniciativa. Puede apoyar precomprando el libro.
Queremos que nos apoye en este emprendimiento, para poder hacer realidad este libro.
Los fondos son para auto-publicar el libro
Al mejor estilo de 48 Días. No busque que lo escojan, escójase a usted.
No quiero salir a buscar editoriales. Quiero que lo publiquemos nosotros (cuando digo nosotros, hablo de la comunidad de 48 Días en español).
La donación más pequeña recibirá el libro en primera edición autografiado. De ahí en adelante armaremos productos que esperamos les sea interesantes.
La meta está en 5.000USD. Creemos que con 10' de pesos (COP), tenemos para nuestra primera edición.
El impacto
Queremos poder llegar a más personas, sobre todo en las regiones y en otros países. 
Sabemos que tenemos un excelente mensaje que le cambia la vida a las personas.
Queremos ayudar y hacer de la vida de muchos una vida digna con un trabajo que dignifique y llene de propósito a la persona.
Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar
Si por alguna razón quiere ayudar pero no puede, lo único que le pedimos es que le cuente a una amiga o amigo. Esa es la mayor ayuda que podemos recibir.

<p><strong>Who am I?</strong> I am a medium, clairvoyant, and angel communicator and ever since I was little I saw and sensed ghosts and spirits.  In my journey to learn how to understand what was happening, protect myself, and work with them safely (the topic of my first book <em>Life and the After-Life</em>), I started working with angels.  I experienced profound shifts in my life once I invited the angels to help me, and I’d like to let others know about them.  Prior to working with angels, I was unemployed, physically ill, and going through a very painful divorce.   Every area of my life was in crisis!  Now I am happy, the founder of a growing company, and life is truly magical.  You can find out more about me and my work here: <a href=""http://healingpowers.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://healingpowers.net/</a></p>

This book was made to be your friend in times of loneliness and in times of growth.<br/><br/>My name is Colleen Finney, and I am the author of Young Adult Life: Navigating the Best and Worst Years. I wrote this book because throughout my own mental health journey, I read many self-help books that made me feel like what I was going through wasn’t acceptable or okay. They made me feel like an alien and often gave me a three-step guide to changing my life. It never worked and made me feel worse. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that there are many people your age dealing with similar struggles. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for navigating the highs and lows of life as well as the stigma behind mental health. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you not feel alone in the worst times and to use the advice given by everyday people in the best times. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about many mental health topics and how people worked through them, as well as the struggles people deal with every day and the advice they give to get to the other side of the tunnel. You'll hear stories about:</p><p>Being in relationships and going through breakups as a young adult.</p><p>Breaking down your childhood trauma and seeing how it sets the foundation for the rest of your life. </p><p>How depression can consume you and what it can teach you in the long run.</p><p>You will love this book if you have dealt with the highs and lows of life, struggles throughout your own mental health journey, or just need to feel like you’re not alone. <br/><br/>Young Adult Life: Navigating the Best and Worst Years is a nonfiction book that speaks to young adults and people juggling mental health who want to look at mental health topics surrounding people, moments, and internal struggles in a new way.</p><h3><strong>The Book — Young Adult Life: Navigating the Best and Worst Years</strong></h3><p>The book is written in three parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 (People)</strong> contains the introduction and chapters Family Isn’t Everything, Relationships: the good, the bad, &amp; the ugly, and Friends: they come and go. This section covers the outside source of mental health that you can’t control: other people. This section includes stories of being in relationships and going through breakups, as well as weird family dynamics and the trauma they can cause. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2 (Moments)</strong> contains chapters Childhood Trauma: the foundation of it all, The Best and Worst Years of Your Life, and “That will never happen to me.” This section covers the moments in your life that have a lasting impact on your past, present, and future. This section includes stories about how childhood trauma affects the rest of your life and my own story about being sexually assaulted. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3 (Internal Struggles)</strong> contains chapters Normalizing Depression, The Power of Support with Depression, The Fear of the Unknown: exciting, but oh so scary, Accepting Living with the Impossible, Therapy and Seeking Help and the Conclusion. This section covers the biggest part of mental health: the mental part. It includes everything that affects you internally and the world around you. This section includes stories from others about their struggles with depression and anxiety, as well as the ups and downs of living with an illness or diagnosis. </p><h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs of publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p><p>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December of 2021.</p><p>The Cover Design of my book.

She knew then that someday she wanted to write a book that was the friend her blog post had been for others. She is also very passionate about mental health and wants to help change the stigma behind it. She thinks it’s time we start talking about our feelings and struggles because they are the things that make us human. <br/><br/>Outside of this book, she is your average, everyday young adult trying to figure out life, just like the rest of you. She still goes to therapy and is very much still trying to figure out what makes her feel alive and what drags her down. She loves spending time with her friends and family and making memories any way she can. <br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Colleen at cefinney99@gmail.com and on social media!<br/><br/>Instagram: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/_colllleeeen_/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/_colllleeeen_/</a><br/>Facebook: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/colleen.finney.3/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/colleen.finney.3/</a><br/>Twitter: <a href=""https://twitter.com/_colllleeeen_"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/_colllleeeen_</a><br/>LinkedIn: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleen-finney/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleen-finney/</a> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627018559/ft8uhi9y9d3erfl1syp3.png"" src=""""/></p></div>","Story of My BookYoung Adult Life: Navigating the Best and Worst Years contains stories from everyday people navigating young adult life and mental health.

Sadly, I’ve reached a point where my limited financial resources are just not enough. To print this publication, some additional funds are needed. This will allow the printing process to follow the industry's highest quality standards—the same quality applied to the first “And Justice For Art” book.

If we join forces, we can bring “And Justice For Art – Vol.2” to life. Your support through this crowd-funding campaign will help raise the rest of the money needed to print the book. The specific amount being asked will allow us to produce a considerable amount of copies—between 500 and 1000, depending on the raised amount—without sacrificing high quality printing standards.Ideally, I would like to raise $13.447.00 (Dollars). This will be used for:$10.447.00 for PRINTING $3000.00 for SHIPPING MATERIALS (Boxes, Padded Envelopes, Shipping Tape, Bubble Wrap, etc.)  to SHIP THE BOOKS AND PERKS TO READERS/BACKERS.                         Even if the campaign’s goal is not met, I will make sure to use any amount we raise to print as many copies as possible. This will allow the information contained in the book to reach as many fans/readers as possible. That’s the ultimate goal of this project.WHAT YOU GETThe perks offered to those who support this project are worth the commitment. As happened in the first book’s campaign, many contributors will have the opportunity of having their names included in the book’s Thank You credits. Also, some of the bands and artists featured in the book have donated really cool items for the campaign—including merchandise and signed memorabilia, etc.All the perks include FREE shipping. For more information, feel free to check the complete list of perks. Most perks/books will ship around October, 2018.OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPEven if you are not interested or can’t collaborate, you can be a part of this.

<p><b><i>Cable</i>, the Novel:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Based on the actual dramatic construction of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, <i>Cable</i> is a deeply powerful story of struggle, brotherhood, love, and the triumph of the human spirit. </p>
<p><i>Cable</i> captures the story of the bridge workers suspended high above the surface of the world... laying catwalks, lifting saddles, spinning cables, securing a far-reaching roadway over the bay...in the wind, ice, and fog… always just one careless step from death.  <i>Cable</i> tells of their work and their lives and their loves… creating a monument to themselves and their nation.</p>
<p>The story rides on gritty atmosphere and sharp-edged encounters, centering on characters with great depth, many of them barely surviving the hard life. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Introduction:</b></p>
<p>In the early 1930s, the people of
San Francisco decided to do something impossible… they decided to build a
bridge across the Golden Gate Strait. 
All they needed was a design, money,  steel -- and men.</p>
<p>The experts planned for at least 35
deaths… but the men came anyway.  From
across the nation they came… world-famous engineers, steel workers, unemployed
musicians, construction workers, Okie farmers, and highway builders … heroes
and cowards… saints and sinners… they came to San Francisco to build a bridge.</p>
<p>These men built one of the most beautiful and iconic structure in the world.  Millions of people come each year to revel in the beauty of this architectural wonder.  Yet, surprisingly, not much is known about
the men who actually built this magnificent bridge.</p>

<br/>
<p>In 1935, a young man, Tony Wright, leaves his home in Oklahoma one step ahead of the Sheriff after losing his wife in child-birth and his farm to foreclosure.  He arrives in San Francisco, penniless, friendless, jobless, and in deep despair.</p>
<p>By chance, he is hired to work on the Golden Gate Bridge construction as part of an elite team of cable-layers. He quickly learns that on the high reaches of the emerging bridge, his very life depends on his skills and on his crew-mates. </p>
<p>The crew includes five strong men… different from each other in background, temperament, beliefs, and dreams… and yet linked together by their work and their desire to survive.</p>
<p>Each man is building a new bridge and a new life… with new friends and new enemies…loves found and lost… a growing sense of purpose and confidence.  And all the while, they each know that one tiny misstep will end it all.</p>
<p>While each man explores his own destiny, they find themselves bound to the Bridge and to each other.</p>

<h3>And we're not done yet...you can still support the project by ordering your own copy today!</h3>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Hard Work Is Not Enough is a book about developing the soft-skills required to be more believable, strategic, and influential at work.</p>
<p>I am Jeff Shannon, the author of Hard Work Is Not Enough. I wrote this book because I listened to advice claiming that to move up in the organization, all you had to do was become an expert in your field and work harder than anyone else. As many managers and aspiring leaders do, I quickly learned this approach builds a reputation of dependability, but dependability doesn’t equal influence. I felt stuck until I realized I needed to change my strategy.</p>
<p>My hope for this book is to help you increase your influence with your team and organization. It’s a book filled with stories of people just like you and me who became experts and worked hard to end up frustrated when what got them there wouldn’t get them where they wanted to be.

Story of My Book
Hard Work Is Not Enough is a book about developing the soft-skills required to be more believable, strategic, and influential at work.
I am Jeff Shannon, the author of Hard Work Is Not Enough. I wrote this book because I listened to advice claiming that to move up in the organization, all you had to do was become an expert in your field and work harder than anyone else. As many managers and aspiring leaders do, I quickly learned this approach builds a reputation of dependability, but dependability doesn’t equal influence. I felt stuck until I realized I needed to change my strategy.
My hope for this book is to help you increase your influence with your team and organization. It’s a book filled with stories of people just like you and me who became experts and worked hard to end up frustrated when what got them there wouldn’t get them where they wanted to be. They had to transform themselves by building the often overlooked soft skills to reach their highest potential.
I want to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for personal development and growth so you can achieve your goals. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you make a lasting impact on individuals, teams, and your company for years to come.
In this book, you’ll learn about being more believable and strategic in your work. You’ll hear stories such as...

How to know when it’s time to change your career strategy
How letting some fires burn can lead to greater productivity
How your instincts might be making you a bad people manager

 
You will love this book if you are up for a challenge. This book isn’t for everyone, but if you’re interested in learning what attitudes and behaviors will help you be more influential and maximize your potential, then it’s for you.

<p><u><strong>Story of My Book</strong></u></p>How to Make the Matriarchy - My journey to answer the question: <i>can we achieve gender equality in my lifetime, and what will it take to get there?</i><br/><br/>My name is Maureen Devine-Ahl and I am the author of How to Make the Matriarchy. I wrote this book because I could never quite find my place in the battle cry of Smash the Patriarchy. Instead of rooting in destruction and rage, I was curious and wondered, what if we were rooted in vision and potential? What does a more gender-balanced society look like? Who in the world can offer clues to getting there? What are the biggest remaining barriers standing in the way? And most importantly, how can I take steps to enable this new future?<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you’ll join me in exploring the inspiring stories, cautionary tales, and takeaway lessons on what it will take to build a more gender-balanced future. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same passion and excitement I have for the potential of empowering women to build a newer, more inclusive society. I have learned so much on this journey, including everyday actions I can take to shift the culture and impact the future. I ultimately want you to see this book as a tool to help you discover ways in which you can do the same.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the places in the world that have made great gains in gender equality, what we can learn from them, and how they influence what I define as the four key areas we must focus on to move forward, such as:<br/> <ul>
<li>How Rwanda came to be ranked #1 in the world for parliamentary representation by women, and how installing more women in leadership has led to major gains in equality in a relatively short period of time.</li>
<li>How the coronavirus pandemic, while providing stark evidence of the effectiveness of female leaders, can either serve as an accelerant for knocking down some of our biggest gender barriers, or a tremendous threat to erasing decades of gains made in gender equality.</li>
<li>Details behind how Nordic countries have made great gains in closing gender gaps, and how strategies to empower women and reduce dependency end up benefiting not just women, but entire societies, making them some of the happiest places in the world to live.</li>
</ul> You will love this book if you're passionate about gender equality, or even just willing to learn more. You will love this book if you're curious about what big or small everyday things you can do to empower current and future generations to build a more equitable and inclusive society.<br/> <p><u><strong>The Book - How to Make the Matriarchy</strong></u></p>The book is written in Three Parts....<ul>
<li>In part 1 we get rooted in the status of women around the world: the good, the bad, and the ugly. We explore a handful of existing matriarchal societies, where they are, and the surprising things we can learn about them. We’ll dig in to the data of which countries are some of the best in the world for women and gender equality in general, and set the stage for what we can learn from them.</li>
<li>In part 2, our learning journey begins to resemble a puzzle in progress, identifying the “corners” my research shows are some of the biggest barriers standing in the way of achieving gender equality. We explore the “pieces” within those corners, with the idea that if each of us picks a few pieces to make changes in our own lives, we could begin to assemble the puzzle that represents a society no longer about power over others (patriarchy), but the power of inclusion (my definition of the matriarchy).</li>
<li>In part 3, I’ll share what changes I’m committing to making after this learning journey. We’ll explore the dangers of backsliding- how progress is not finite and how we need to continue to protect the progress already made, while continue to work towards more.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Mental Frameworks For The Modern Revolution is about how to change our mental frameworks to get us onto a pathway towards creating a better world and coming to grips with the fact that no matter your view on the world, if you want to create real change externally it starts with understanding the change that has to get done internally.<br/><br/>My name is Ariane and I am the author of Mental Frameworks for our Modern Revolution: Change Your Mind if you want to Change The World. I wrote this book because the conversation around the problems in our country and the changes that need to be made are incredibly pertinent at the moment and I believe the conversation about the inner mental work that everyone has to do to contribute to our better future is missing from a lot of the conversations around advocacy and activism.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that your current mental frameworks might not be conducive to systematic change and you come to understand how many problems in the world are a reflections of our mental framework limitations. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the possibility for each of us to implement change in the world by working to change ourselves. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you get a better nuanced view on the world around you and what it means to change it.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about what it means to change your mental framework, specifically focusing on three mindsets that I believe are particularly important to be changed and aren't being addressed in general activism and advocacy: our relationship with history, our perceptions of different places in this country and the people who inhabit them, and finally, how we view things through the lens of a binary of one thing vs. another.<br/><br/>This book explores these topics through the minds and lives of people living and studying them. You’ll learn how a professor came to realize what it meant to valuably teach history, how a psychologist applies theories of evolutionary psychology to the world we live in today, and how a Rabbi realized their community had broken into “sides.” You’ll hear from regular college students about what it means to be a progressive in our generation when you come from the midwest, the south, the west coast, and the northeast.<br/><br/>Mental Frameworks for the Modern Revolution is a nonfiction book that speaks to activists, people involved in advocacy, or just somebody who wants to see change in our county</p>
<p><i><strong>Mental Frameworks for the Modern Revolution: Change Your Mind if you Want To Change The World </strong></i><strong>is divided into 3 parts</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1 and 2. In this part of the book I explain what inspired to me write about my topic, and I explain what a ‘mental framework’ really is and what it means to actually change it.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 3-8. This part details the three mental frameworks I believe we each need to reexamine. Our relationship with history, perceptions of different parts of the US, and the way our minds are drawn to understanding things as a binary of one thing vs. another.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 9 and 10. This part of the book is my final call to action and conclusion. I talk about the reason why I believe this change is possible and how powerful it can be to know that you, individually, are capable of changing the world simply by changing your mind.   </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Mental Frameworks For The Modern Revolution is about how to change our mental frameworks to get us onto a pathway towards creating a better world and coming to grips with the fact that no matter your view on the world, if you want to create real change externally it starts with understanding the change that has to get done internally.My name is Ariane and I am the author of Mental Frameworks for our Modern Revolution: Change Your Mind if you want to Change The World. I wrote this book because the conversation around the problems in our country and the changes that need to be made are incredibly pertinent at the moment and I believe the conversation about the inner mental work that everyone has to do to contribute to our better future is missing from a lot of the conversations around advocacy and activism.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that your current mental frameworks might not be conducive to systematic change and you come to understand how many problems in the world are a reflections of our mental framework limitations. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the possibility for each of us to implement change in the world by working to change ourselves. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you get a better nuanced view on the world around you and what it means to change it.In this book, you'll learn about what it means to change your mental framework, specifically focusing on three mindsets that I believe are particularly important to be changed and aren't being addressed in general activism and advocacy: our relationship with history, our perceptions of different places in this country and the people who inhabit them, and finally, how we view things through the lens of a binary of one thing vs. another.This book explores these topics through the minds and lives of people living and studying them. You’ll learn how a professor came to realize what it meant to valuably teach history, how a psychologist applies theories of evolutionary psychology to the world we live in today, and how a Rabbi realized their community had broken into “sides.” You’ll hear from regular college students about what it means to be a progressive in our generation when you come from the midwest, the south, the west coast, and the northeast.Mental Frameworks for the Modern Revolution is a nonfiction book that speaks to activists, people involved in advocacy, or just somebody who wants to see change in our county
Mental Frameworks for the Modern Revolution: Change Your Mind if you Want To Change The World is divided into 3 parts:
Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1 and 2. In this part of the book I explain what inspired to me write about my topic, and I explain what a ‘mental framework’ really is and what it means to actually change it.Part 2 contains chapters 3-8. This part details the three mental frameworks I believe we each need to reexamine. Our relationship with history, perceptions of different parts of the US, and the way our minds are drawn to understanding things as a binary of one thing vs. another.Part 3 contains chapters 9 and 10. This part of the book is my final call to action and conclusion. I talk about the reason why I believe this change is possible and how powerful it can be to know that you, individually, are capable of changing the world simply by changing your mind.

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><i>The Innovative Mindset</i> is about how entrepreneurs have defied the status quo and started and grown successful companies with the right mindset/tools.<br/><br/>My name is Sameer Gupta, and I am the author of the Innovative Mindset. I wrote this book because I believe that it can be very easy to conform to peer’s expectations in the modern age. Many people feel they cannot pursue their entrepreneurial or otherwise creative ambitions for various reasons. These can be financial, time or social constraints. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how startups have grown to become successful not only because of the product/services they offer but also because the mindset their founders embody. I want to share the different tools that will equip you with the resources to become successful in your personal and professional life.<br/><br/>In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for startups, growing companies, and novel/innovative ideas in you.  Ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you start your own venture.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why failure is important with Joshua Anton’s personal story (a true rags to riches story that will keep you on edge)</li>
<li>How to develop company culture from Anthony Casalena, Founder of Squarespace </li>
<li>What it’s like to build a product acquired by Apple from Sony Theakanath, Head of Special Products at Apple</li>
<li>How to effectively lead a team with Thuan Phan, Chief Technology Officer of Uber</li>
<li>Why determination is key from Carlos Vera, Founder of Pay Our Interns (fun fact, his team successfully pushed Congress to pass $31 million in funding for Congressional interns!)</li>
<li>How to sell your product from Tim Brown, Founder of All Birds</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>You will love this book if you are motivated and interested in learning how successful companies grow and succeed. You don’t need to have an idea or a company to gain from reading this book. You will benefit as along as you practice some of the skills I outline.<br/><br/>The Innovative Mindset is a non-fiction book that speaks to undergraduate students and entrepreneurial-minded folks who are looking to start or grow their companies or simply learn how to organize their time efficiently.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Book - The Innovative Mindset</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The book is written in <strong>3 parts.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Part one</strong> contains an introduction and chapters one and two. In this part, you will learn about the landscape we currently live in and how that is affecting the risk individuals take. I will dive a little deeper into what challenge is and why you should challenge yourself.<br/><br/><strong>Part two </strong>contains chapters three through six. In these chapters, I outline four principles with several supporting examples you can start thinking about in order to change the way you go about your personal and professional business. Using well-known psychology concepts, expert opinions, personal research, and interviews, I explore and reveal how individuals prioritize their time and change their mindsets for the better; I have used common brands like Dyson technologies and Starbucks to elucidate some of these principles in a digestible fashion. <br/><br/><strong>Part three</strong> contains chapters seven through nine and a conclusion. Within these chapters, I illustrate how founders and successful people in business have utilized the principles outlined in previous chapters. I show you how a behemoth like Apple acquires a small startup founded by undergraduates at UC Berkeley. I show you how a University of Virginia undergraduate founded a multi-million dollar data company, a true rags to riches story. I take all the concepts and skills outlined earlier in the book and make them real with living, breathing and laughing people!</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p><br/>Sameer Gupta is a 3rd-year undergraduate at the University of Virginia studying Economics and Entrepreneurship. He decided to write this book because he has always been curious about how people start successful companies and rise to the top. He is passionate about startups and new companies developing innovative and groundbreaking products. This is because he feels these types of companies have the most potential to disrupt antiquated industries and impact the lives of millions of people for the better. He is curious to see how startups become well-oiled machines poised for success.<br/><br/>Whether it is a family party, coffee shop, or dinner out, Sameer is fearless in talking to random people in hopes of making new connections and learning something new. He enjoys serendipitous conversations such as those with the person drinking coffee next to him. He comes from Springfield, a small town in Northern Virginia. If you don't find him studying for class or vibing with friends, you will be sure to find him eating/cooking (one of his favorite things to do). He has a deep-rooted penchant for asian inspired food. Thai, Chinese, Taiwanese, and Indian food ‘keep him on his toes!’<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Sameer at sg4vh@virginia.edu, Instagram @sam_g98, or Linkedln @<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameer-gupta-ba9a2587/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameer-gupta-ba9a2587/</a></p>

You will love this book if you are motivated and interested in learning how successful companies grow and succeed. You don’t need to have an idea or a company to gain from reading this book. You will benefit as along as you practice some of the skills I outline.The Innovative Mindset is a non-fiction book that speaks to undergraduate students and entrepreneurial-minded folks who are looking to start or grow their companies or simply learn how to organize their time efficiently.
 
The Book - The Innovative Mindset
 
The book is written in 3 parts.Part one contains an introduction and chapters one and two. In this part, you will learn about the landscape we currently live in and how that is affecting the risk individuals take. I will dive a little deeper into what challenge is and why you should challenge yourself.Part two contains chapters three through six. In these chapters, I outline four principles with several supporting examples you can start thinking about in order to change the way you go about your personal and professional business. Using well-known psychology concepts, expert opinions, personal research, and interviews, I explore and reveal how individuals prioritize their time and change their mindsets for the better; I have used common brands like Dyson technologies and Starbucks to elucidate some of these principles in a digestible fashion. Part three contains chapters seven through nine and a conclusion. Within these chapters, I illustrate how founders and successful people in business have utilized the principles outlined in previous chapters. I show you how a behemoth like Apple acquires a small startup founded by undergraduates at UC Berkeley. I show you how a University of Virginia undergraduate founded a multi-million dollar data company, a true rags to riches story. I take all the concepts and skills outlined earlier in the book and make them real with living, breathing and laughing people!

Risks & Challenges
 
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

The books in that room were works of great quality, and I began to wonder: ""Where would I go TODAY to begin building a collection like this?""</p><p>I found that it was harder than I thought to find what I was looking for.

In order to get past these obstacles, get things started, and ensure I did things by the book (pun intended!), I decided to begin with trade paperbacks and a rebinding process.

Now, you can continue to follow your favorite characters with this amazing rebound edition!Introducing: ""A Clash of Kings"" Rebound in a way that only Artem Charta can!  You've Never Seen Books Like These!The books we create feature details you won't find anywhere else.   Each copy features a cast metal nickel plated emblem on the cover. This cast metal emblem is an original piece of artwork inspired by elements of the story. This book, ""A Clash of Kings"", features a crown of swords based on that worn by Robb Stark as ""The King in the North"".Surrounding the cover is a raised cover border. This border not only continues the theme of a three dimensional cover, but also helps to protect the emblem from adjacent books when the volume is on a shelf. The cover material is entirely hand formed over this border, which takes considerable time and guarantees quality.The spine of each book features a concealed rare earth magnet which holds a small bookmark in the shape of a sword. As with the emblem, each sword design is cast metal, nickel plated, and unique to each book in the series.  Inside, each book is given a completely new cleat sewn binding, the strongest binding for rebound books of this type. This edition also features deep navy blue end sheets (acting on the feedback from the collectors of our first project!), and red/yellow stripped head and foot bands at the end of the spine.   The beautifully numbered and hubbed spine features a decorative sword inspired by the the world of A Song of Ice and Fire. The sword is securely held in place by a strong rare earth magnet concealed inside the spine. This also served to center the bookmark on the spine in the same place each time you put it away. Unmistakable. Even on a shelf.""A Clash of Kings"" Rebound (right) next to our first project (""A Game of Thrones"", left)It is to the support of this growing community that I owe the most sincere appreciation. Those that back our project will have the chance to claim a copy of this amazing edition at the lowest price we have ever offered! In order to explain the different reward options, I've outlined them below!$189 - Only 100 Available!Our LOWEST price for 1 volume!By pledging to this reward level, you'll claim your very own copy of this incredible volume of ""A Clash of Kings"" with all of the amazing features you've seen and read about. The ultimate collector's edition! $379 - Only 50 Available! SAVE OVER $145!As a thank you for your amazing support, you will get a copy of our first edition: ""A Game of Thrones"" AND a copy of our latest project: ""A Clash of Kings""!These are not just fancy slip covers...Creating one of our editions taken a large amount of labor and craftsmanship. The features we include in our designs do not lend themselves to mass production, and the quality expected of the final product means that hand work is the only option available.Each book is handled individually throughout the process, from the bespoke new sewn binding, to the amazing features like the hand forming of the cover material. Each feature is carefully considered so that these volumes stand out against any other edition.Our books start life as trade paperbacks. Trade paperbacks feature beautiful page accents, premium paper stock compared to mass market paperbacks, and the established print quality that we will require of our final product.The first step is to strip these paperback books down completely until they are simply a stack of loose pages. The old glued spine is completely removed, and the books are ready for the Smyth Cleat sewing process.A text block in the cleat sewing machineCleat sewing gives these books the strongest possible foundation so that they last and last!Cleat sewn binding schematic and one of our text blocks after sewingThe text blocks are then trimmed to the final dimensions, and any unfinished edges are squared.Trimming the text blockTrimmed vs untrimmed text blockMeanwhile, the covers are being assembled and made ready to receive the text blocks. This includes the spine magnet, the cover border and emblem, and the title stamping.Raw materials for building the covers!Cover awaiting stampingThe press used for stamping and embossingImage from our previous project ""A Game of Thrones"" ReboundOnce the text blocks are prepared, and the cover is ready, the two are combined to create the final product!  ""A Clash of Kings"" Rebound next to our first project ""A Game of Thrones""The books are proudly rebound here in the United States. This proximity gives us great control over the quality of our books at every stage, and helps to make sure that we stay on top of the entire process.I've also worked very hard to ensure that nothing about these books takes due credit away from the people who deserve it. Our editions start as trade paperbacks, ensuring that everyone involved in the creation and printing of the book gets their due! We then carefully removing the binding to rebind it to create a unique collector's edition unlike any other. I'm not stopping with just one or two books, or even just one series. As I have said before, this will be the first of many titles I plan to undertake. Can you imagine how an entire collection of books like this would look on your bookshelf?... But in order to get there, I need YOUR HELP! It is your support that will make this grow!Hi, I'm MichaelI founded Artem Charta (Latin, artem - art; charta – papyrus or paper) with a single goal: redefine what a collector's edition book can be. My interest in quality books began when I found myself inside a very large, and very old, private library full of aged and character-filled books and volumes. As I looked around that room, I could imagine the owner sitting by the fireplace late at night, lost in the pages of a book from his collection. The books in that room were works of great quality, and I began to wonder: ""Where would I go TODAY to begin building a collection like this?""I found that it was harder than I thought to find what I was looking for. The more I looked, the more I realized that I wanted something a bit different than what had been done before. I knew that the first hurdle would be negotiating the complicated world of punishing and printing. In order to get past these obstacles, get things started, and ensure I did things by the book (pun intended!), I decided to begin with trade paperbacks and a rebinding process. This would ensure that I would have a quality print product inside, and that everyone involved in the printing and publishing gets the credit they are due. From their, I had a foundation to create the beautiful collector's editions you see above!Thank you to everyone who helped start us on this journey by supporting our first project, and to all who join our community by supporting us here!",34.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>For those who want to start working out but can’t find the courage to join a gym, <strong>So What Have You Got To Lose</strong> is for you. <strong>So What Have You Got To Lose</strong> is the name of a book I am writing to arm you with all you need to know before stepping foot into your local health center. Unlike the countless other ""gym"" books on the market this one is different. This is the book you want to read <em>before</em> picking up any of the others. I'm not trying to sell you on some new workout craze or weight loss method but rather providing you with a survival guide to get you through those first few steps, days or weeks at the gym. Imagine the first time you went grocery shopping on your own, how prepared were you. Did you have a list? Did you know the layout of the store? Or did you find yourself feeling overwhelmed with options and people from the second you walked through those sliding glass doors?</p>
<p>Now imagine that before you even left your house that day you'd read a guide explaining all that you'd need to know. This guide included information regarding what days and times are best to shop, what kinds of crowds you'd be running into and where to score the free samples. It also included a layout of the store and offered several strategies (which had been observed over time) as to how to make your visit as pleasurable, comfortable and efficient as possible. Would you have taken the time to read or even glance at this first? I sure would have.<br/></p>

<p>I may not be able to tell you what to do but at least I'll be able to tell you what to expect. <strong>So What Have You Got To Lose</strong> is a project I have yet to begin as I will seek to learn everything there is to know about the gym.

By contributing to my campaign you will be allowing me to leave my full time job while I make going to the gym my job, my office, my life. I plan to spend 9 months (equivalent to the time it takes to birth a child) immersing myself in this project as I study the atmosphere, people, trends and policies within four very different health club settings. My time will be divided between a basic $10 a month gym, LA Fitness (a middle of the line health center), Anytime Fitness (a 24 hour key card entry club) and Lifetime Fitness (a fully staffed 24 hour club). I will spend months visiting these clubs during every operating hour taking notes and making observations on everyone and everything that goes down. I will then use these notes and experiences (trust me some funny stuff happens at the gym) to put together my book <strong>So What Have You Got To Lose</strong>. <br/></p>

I want, more than anything, to pull myself out of my 8-5 rut and fulfill not one but two of my lifelong goals. Number one is to get healthy and stay healthy! Number two is to write my own book.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>    I've been
troubled for a very long time about the obsession our country has about being <b>Number
One</b>. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>    For politicians across the political spectrum making sure this country is <b>Number One </b>is a mantra that is hard-wired. Either because ""God"" divined it as so, or for 
some other reason, the U.S.  is hailed as ""exceptional"". It is a
 deep, article of faith across the
nation--even if there is unease these days about where the country stands.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>    This book that will argue that <b>we don't need to be Number One</b>--especially in the areas we traditionally strive to be the top-dog: economic might and military superiority. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>    It's a book that will be used to <b><i>start a movement</i></b> to counter the ""We're Number One"" ethos. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>    The pursuit to be <b>Number One</b> leads us into wasting a tremendous amount of money on poor
economic decisions and unwise foreign adventurism. The “We’re Number One” chant
alienates governments and people around the world. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>    And the 
""We're Number One"" ethos distracts us from confronting the real 
challenges we face: how the wealth of our country, and the wealth of the
 planet, is flowing into the hands of a few rich people, while our 
planet collapses environmentally. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>    The  truth is that, by many measures, this country is not <b>Number One</b>. We rank far down the list in providing basic social services for our people, for example. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>   And, in the places where the United States is
<b>Number One</b>, we often have nothing to be proud of. For example, we
 have the largest prison population in the world and spend 7 times the 
amount of money on the military than any other country.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>   I think
 focusing now on the question of being Number One is perfect timing. We 
are seeing an
increase in the obsession over being Number One precisely at a time of

</div></div>","Our Story
    I've been
troubled for a very long time about the obsession our country has about being Number
One. 

    For politicians across the political spectrum making sure this country is Number One is a mantra that is hard-wired. Either because ""God"" divined it as so, or for 
some other reason, the U.S.  is hailed as ""exceptional"". It is a
 deep, article of faith across the
nation--even if there is unease these days about where the country stands.

    This book that will argue that we don't need to be Number One--especially in the areas we traditionally strive to be the top-dog: economic might and military superiority. 

    It's a book that will be used to start a movement to counter the ""We're Number One"" ethos. 

    The pursuit to be Number One leads us into wasting a tremendous amount of money on poor
economic decisions and unwise foreign adventurism. The “We’re Number One” chant
alienates governments and people around the world. 

    And the 
""We're Number One"" ethos distracts us from confronting the real 
challenges we face: how the wealth of our country, and the wealth of the
 planet, is flowing into the hands of a few rich people, while our 
planet collapses environmentally. 

    The  truth is that, by many measures, this country is not Number One. We rank far down the list in providing basic social services for our people, for example. 

   And, in the places where the United States is
Number One, we often have nothing to be proud of. For example, we
 have the largest prison population in the world and spend 7 times the 
amount of money on the military than any other country.

   I think
 focusing now on the question of being Number One is perfect timing. We 
are seeing an
increase in the obsession over being Number One precisely at a time of 
increasing
signs of the decline of the country. The 2012 election season is already
 filling up with political rhetoric about the need to remain Number One. China’s economy is growing and its
influence is expanding, and other countries around the world are seizing the leadership
over “green” technologies. 

   Even the president, in a valiant effort to confront the jobs' crisis in America, fell back on to these themes in his most recent address to Congress:

“That's how America can be number one again. That's how America will be number one again.”“And it has been the drive and initiative of our workers and entrepreneurs that has made this economy the engine and envy of the world.”“Let's get to work, and show the world once again why the United States of America remains the greatest nation on Earth.”
    Last point: you cannot seriously deal with the question of
climate change without acknowledging that the very pursuit of being Number One
has hurt the planet because it requires using up even more scarce resources to maintain the top-dog billing.

  Why an E-Book?

   Two reasons. I want to get this out in time for the 2012 election 
season--which is faster than the traditional publishing industry is 
capable of doing. And I don't want to delay by trying to convince the 
traditional publishing industry that the book is worthwhile.

  Funds Will Be
Used:

1. To pay for time for me to write the
book, and related research costs.

2. Initially, the book will
be published solely as an e-book. So, I will hire a designer and tech wiz
(perhaps, the same person) to create a feel for the book and do all the
technological work needed to make the work available on in all the e-formats—similar to the process I
used for my first e-book, “It's Not Raining, We're Getting Peed On: the Scam of
the Deficit Crisis”. 

3. ORGANIZING. Once the public is
 published, it will be used to try to urge leaders and regular people to
 embrace a philosophy that being Number One should not be an obsession.


The Impact
I hope that the campaign will ignite a movement that encourages our country to downplay the idea of ""winning"" over other countries, in favor of a strategy that understands that our country can be a leader even if it isn't Number One.

<p><strong>WHAT'S THE OWS POETRY ANTHOLOGY?!</strong></p>
<p class=""messageBody"">The <a href=""http://peopleslibrary.wordpress.com/2011/11/17/occupy-wall-street-poetry-anthology/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OWS Poetry Anthology</a> was born the second week of the Occupy Wall Street Poetry Assembly. <span class=""messageBody"">The anthology consists of 721 poems, 4 poetic introductions, 448 poets (140 women, 275 men, 34 androgynous) and poems in English, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Urdu, German, Japanese, Chinese and Dutch</span>. I was so overwhelmed by the diversity and greatness of the poems presented during the first week of the Assembly, that I knew the assembly must be archived. So at the second Poetry Assembly I asked the poets gathered if I could archive it, then I gave out my email, expecting only a few poems to show up in my inbox. The response was overwhelming, and in the weeks that followed, I received a steady stream of poems from people all over the world. It seemed everyone that had been struck by the Occupy Movement had something to say, and an open Poetry Anthology, that was open to all voices and all types of ""poetry"" seemed like the appropriate way of archiving the inclusive spirit of Occupy Wall Street.</p>
<p>Many names have contributed to the anthology, some of which you may know: the visual artist Molly Crabapple did the cover art and some of the more prominent poets that contributed are Adrienne Rich, Eileen Myles, Ngoma Hill, the Allen Ginsberg Society on behalf of Allen, Wanda Coleman, CA Conrad, Dodie Bellamy, Kevin Killian, Charles Bernstein, Eliot Katz, Michael McClure, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Bob Holman, Lee Ann Brown, Anne Waldman, Puma Pearl, Danny Schechter, Stuart Leonard, Filip Marinovich, Ariana Reines, Frank Sherlock, and many many more...</p>
<p>The money donated to this project will allow for the OWS Poetry Anthology to be printed and given away to a lot of people. The more money the project receives, the more copies we will be able to print. The anthology has been open to anyone to send in poems of any size and definition since early October 2011. It's over a thousand Microsoft Word pages. It's probably the lengthiest, most inclusive text the Occupy Wall Street movement has yet produced and its a direct reflection of the SOUL of the movement. On April 14th, the Jefferson Market Library in Manhattan will be hosting the OWS Poetry Anthology community for an afternoon of open readings, where anyone can come and join and read a poem. To mark the occasion, we will be presenting the library with the first book print copy of the anthology for them to have on record. Also the money will go towards shipping and storage fees. Here's a basic example of the breakdown of the numbers: if we get forty about thirty will go to printing and then ten will go toward shipping/storage/getting them into the hands of people. If you want to see a more serious breakdown of the numbers, contact me and I can show you what I'm working with.</p>
<p>The Anthology is over a thousand pages, it's a very big book. It's like the predecessor to A People's History of the United States, it offers real voices, and an inclusivety unavailable in the publishing world... Originally I was going to ask for $50,000.00 as it's going to be expensive to print this book and ship it. But in the interest of just getting copies into the world, I figured it was safer to shoot for $30,000.00. However, if the goal is met, and more money comes in, that will mean more copies can be printed. The more copies printed, the more people will be able to own it and the more special collections we will be able to get it into. By the time this project is completed, the NY Public Library and Poet's House in NYC will already have copies in their collections. I'd like to get this important record into as many public collections as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY A CAMPAIGN?!</strong></p>
<p>For the past few months I've been trying to persuade publishers to print the book in its entirety but it seems the values of this book do not mesh with the values of a publishing company, as we would like for this book to be given out to people freely and we would prefer not exclude any poets nor poems from its pages. So it seems the only way to keep the book, in all its magick, is to print it ourselves and to bring it to the people ourselves, and to read from its pages ourselves. This book is a radical departure from the traditional structure of the ""anthology"", most anthologies are very selective, while this collection seeks to welcome all forms of poetry and engages in experiments like placing a famous poets poet next to a never before heard poet. What happens when you don't exclude an idea and you let everyone encounter the idea? What happens when you print thousands of copies of a book of poetry and GIVE IT AWAY FREE?!</p>
<p>The poems that have comprised this anthology are poems from the soul, poems demanding a new world, poems begging that the recession end, poems from hysterical and starving peers, even poems from the 1% ready to argue against Occupy Wall Street, there are poems from the world over that is standing up virtually naked at the feet of a corporate beast, a war of David versus Goliath scope, and the people that have assembled and added to the OWS Anthology are ready to speak out against the atrocities destroying our Earth, fight back and create a future that can beget a future.</p>
<p>Once the books are printed, they will regularly be available for pick up with the Peoples Library at UnOppressive NonImperialist Bargain Books. Copies of the anthology will also be shipped to Occupations all over the world, and it's my goal to get a copy of the anthology into every major library system in the world. In this way, by trying to get the anthology into as many individual hands as well as public collections, the anthology will have a safe place to continue to tell the tales of this movement and moment in time.</p>
<p>I read from and spoke about the Anthology on the progressive radio station WBAI a little while back, you can listen to that program <a href=""http://minorprogression.com/2012/02/21/the-ows-poetry-anthology-on-wbai/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. The Anthology has received a lot of press, from <a href=""http://occupiedmedia.us/2012/01/the-peoples-library-3-0-mobile-and-in-the-streets/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">independent press</a> to <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/164766/peoples-library-occupy-wall-street-lives"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Nation</a> to the <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204644504576649250732446240.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wall Street Journal</a>. So if you're interested and unfamiliar with this project, search around the internet and you will find a lot of information about what we've been doing!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CAMPAIGN BREAKDOWN</strong>:</p>
<p>The anthology isn't finalized yet, so we aren't quite sure the cost of each book. Estimated costs are $12-40 depending on quality. Quality will be determined by the amount of money raised and will consider how many we can print. We want to put out a lasting, quality book... ideally.</p>
<p>$50 donations ensure 1 maybe 2 copies will be printed</p>
<p> $100 donations ensures 2 or 3 or 4 copies are printed.</p>
<p>You get the idea.... Most importantly, we need everyone to spread the campaign to their community and social network. It's important not just to help raise funding, but also to raise awareness about this unique and amazing document. If 400 people donated $100 we'd reach our target, if 1600 people donated $25 we'd reach our target. To take this document and print it and distribute it, is totally worthwhile and reachable goal.</p>

My trip to Texas! My name is Kayla. I'm a 20 year old poet from
Middletown, New York. I'm a Sociology major at SUNY Orange working towards a Bachelor's Degree. I started slamming in December, 2012.As a member of the Suffern Slam Society in Suffern,  I began participating in monthly slams held on the first Saturday of
every month. In January, I was selected by a majority audience vote to
compete at the Women of the World Poetry Slam (WoWPS) in Austin, Texas from March 19-22! However,  I'm in need of a little economic boost in helping to reach my goal and afford this opportunity...Which Is Where You Come In!
I'm a poet and a college student...neither of those things pay too well...Your donation will help get me to and from Austin, Texas, and put a pillow under my head for 4 nights. The perks are cool, too! A donation of $5 gets you a personalized haiku card. $10 gets you a chapbook, $20 gets you both, and a donation of $35 or higher, I'll come to your house, your friend's house, your dog's house, your place of work, etc. and perform live poetry for you! Everything will help me reach my goal, but if you can't donate any money, there are......Other Ways You Can Help!Some people can't spare the change. That's fine! Here's what you can do:

<p>A wide variety of guitar instruction books are available which describe different styles of playing, music theory, soloing, jazz and improvisation, flamenco, fingerpicking and strumming techniques on steel string guitar.

<p>Edina Balczo has been producing YouTube guitar lesson videos since 2007. Some of these videos have gone viral and have attracted world-wide attention among guitar students eager to learn the techniques she demonstrates. This book and the accompanying video lessons, which will include clear textual descriptions and professionally-produced video demonstrations of each technique, will be an invaluable resource for anyone interested in mastering the Spanish guitar style.</p>

<br/>The book is written in 3 Parts....<ul>
<li>Part 1 contains the introduction and Chapters 1-3. You will learn about who Gen Z's are and how the world is changing around them. You will see why this generation is going to be the least entrepreneurial, how technology and the business world are changing, and why Gen Z's might be in a perfect spot to pounce on these new opportunities.

<li>Part 2 contains Chapters 4-6. In this part, I reveal my three key skills you need to learn to be successful in the entrepreneurial world or to follow your passion. I interviewed several famous and successful entrepreneurs and boiled down their advice to three easy-to-follow instructions that you can begin today.</li>
<li>Part 3 contains Chapters 7 &amp; 8. In the last part of the book I will teach you how to succeed and what's next for Gen Z's and entrepreneurship in general, and inspire you to pursue your passion.

<h3>
<br/>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>

You will see why this generation is going to be the least entrepreneurial, how technology and the business world are changing, and why Gen Z's might be in a perfect spot to pounce on these new opportunities. I also want to tell you why I call this book Striking Gold and elaborate on just how powerful following your passions can be in transforming your life.
Part 2 contains Chapters 4-6. In this part, I reveal my three key skills you need to learn to be successful in the entrepreneurial world or to follow your passion. I interviewed several famous and successful entrepreneurs and boiled down their advice to three easy-to-follow instructions that you can begin today.
Part 3 contains Chapters 7 & 8. In the last part of the book I will teach you how to succeed and what's next for Gen Z's and entrepreneurship in general, and inspire you to pursue your passion. In essence, this last part is all about a call to action, and giving you specific ways you can implement the skills I taught.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As I mentioned in the above video, there is a very personal association to Romania that has permeated my family. Being presented with this opportunity to really tell a story and to put that story against the backdrop of music is so mind blowing. I have played the cello for 18 years, and I have had so many wonderful opportunities, but none compare to this. I want to create art, and I want to be able to experience facets of my life that were previously closed to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $2000 in 2 weeks. I know it seems insane! But I like to think that all good things are at least a little bit insane. This will specifically go toward funding all of my travel expenses. I am only asking for this because this is what I need immediately, and when it comes to producing my work, I will accomplish it no matter what. So really this is the bare minimum! </p>
<p>What I will be giving you in return is writing, photography, letters, music, a glimpse into another person's perspective, and hopefully a little dash of beauty. It will take me 9 months to put together all of the content as well as bind all of the books, just to be up front about time frame from the get go. Be sure to check out the perks!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>First and foremost, you will change my life forever! That is pretty cool, right?! You have so much power right now! Second, I will be given the opportunity to really contribute something tangible to my community and the world. I personally believe that my craft, in whatever iteration it happens to take, is the best way for me to impact the world around me. It is so much a part of me that I believe it is the only thing I can do. You would be helping me not only in this one instance, but also in bolstering me for my life. </p>
<p></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h1>Destination Forgiveness:  An Excerpt:</h1>
<p>My birthday morning offered sunshine and some early spring warmth and I had a bounce in my step.  Tomorrow I was going to celebrate with Molly, Grace and the family.  Pop was doing one of his legendary legs of lamb.  But today Sophie was taking me to The Dining Room and I was excited.  From the glass of champagne and canapés upon arrival to the 5 courses, each one a surprise and always exquisite, it was a rare treat and my outfit for the evening was painstakingly chosen and already laid out.  My little black dress, the mainstay of every woman’s wardrobe, had been spiced up with a bright red cinch belt and my converse sneakers had been replaced by a pair of brand new, bright red court shoes with a 2 inch heel.   No androgynous looking grunge fashion for me tonight.</p>
<p>Sophie arrived at seven and came in to see the girls while we waited for our taxi. She had organised everything.</p>
<p>When she saw Molly and Grace, I saw her eyes mist up, the year since their last meeting measured by their natural changes.</p>
<p>“My how you’ve grown.” She shook her head in disbelief. “ Hug me, now.”  They ran to their godmother and threw their arms around her.  “My god you both get more beautiful every time I see you.  Are we sure I’m not your real mother?” An old joke, we all laughed anyway.</p>
<p>Pop arrived to get the girls.  They would sleep there tonight as we weren’t sure what time we’d be home – Sophie had hinted at a mysteriously late night so we were prepared for any eventuality.</p>
<p>I kissed Pop and the girls goodbye when we heard the cab slowly making its way up the gravel drive.</p>
<p>Sophie was very animated on the way to The Dining Room, telling me about the next assignment she’d committed to for the following week.</p>
<p>“I’m going to cover the ongoing siege at Waco, Texas.  You’ve heard about David Koresh, the loony leader of a Branch Davidian Sect? He thinks he’s a prophet.  It will be eye-opening I’m sure.”</p>
<p>I no longer watched the news, hadn’t for years.  I found I was too affected by all the bad stuff going on around the world, couldn’t compartmentalise.  Now I was happier being ignorant although possibly rather dull around a dinner table.  It was worth it. But I <em>had</em> heard about Waco, Kate talked about it during our last phone call.</p>
<p>“Kate told me that he’s a very screwed up individual which is not surprising considering his awful childhood. She said he dropped out of high school, has a penchant for teenage girls, and became a born again Christian before deciding he was the final prophet of the Branch Davidians.”</p>
<p>“I’m impressed” Sophie said before going on to describe the gruelling details of the siege in Texas, and before she finished the taxi pulled up outside the large front door of The Dining Room.</p>
<p>I got out of the cab tentatively. A short black dress and high (for me) heels are not every-day attire.  As the cab pulled away, Sophie took my arm and escorted me up the 4 stone steps to the rather grand, double front door banked by vintage stone sculptures of whippets, standing tall and proud either side of the steps. I smiled musing that whippets would be the last dog I would ever choose to guard my front door, except perhaps for shitsu’s and chiwouwous.</p>
<p>The front of the house was covered in a Daphne Odora, its pink and white star-shaped flowers smelling incredibly sweet. It was like walking through a thick veil of perfume and it’s aura of luxury settled around my shoulders like an alpaca shawl.</p>
<p>Within seconds of pulling the big, old fashioned bell pull and hearing the deep dong resonating inside, the door was opened by Rory, Maitre d’, proprietor, husband of the chef, and wine connoisseur.</p>
<p>“Ladies, welcome.  And Happy Birthday Alice.”  I had only met him a couple of times and was flattered he remembered my name.</p>
<p>“Thank you kindly.”  The crowd of people in the spacious entrance hall behind Rory suddenly went quiet.  Rory stood aside to let us into the room and as one, everybody in the hallway turned.  I stood still, couldn’t believe my eyes.  The room was full of friends, my friends, every last one.</p>
<p>I looked from one face to another.  Kate, my gorgeous sister, whom I’d spoken to days before in Los Angeles.  Polly, Elinor, Eric. I couldn’t see everyone, tried to take it all in, felt overwhelmed.</p>
<p>And suddenly everybody was rushing over throwing arms around me, happy birthday being shouted out in surround sound.  Tears started to flow as I hugged each one back, and as I tried to stop the tears from ruining my mascara, it was impossible to stem the emotional tidal wave I was feeling.  All my friends in one place, just for me.</p>

I smiled musing that whippets would be the last dog I would ever choose to guard my front door, except perhaps for shitsu’s and chiwouwous.
The front of the house was covered in a Daphne Odora, its pink and white star-shaped flowers smelling incredibly sweet. It was like walking through a thick veil of perfume and it’s aura of luxury settled around my shoulders like an alpaca shawl.
Within seconds of pulling the big, old fashioned bell pull and hearing the deep dong resonating inside, the door was opened by Rory, Maitre d’, proprietor, husband of the chef, and wine connoisseur.
“Ladies, welcome.  And Happy Birthday Alice.”  I had only met him a couple of times and was flattered he remembered my name.
“Thank you kindly.”  The crowd of people in the spacious entrance hall behind Rory suddenly went quiet.  Rory stood aside to let us into the room and as one, everybody in the hallway turned.  I stood still, couldn’t believe my eyes.  The room was full of friends, my friends, every last one.
I looked from one face to another.  Kate, my gorgeous sister, whom I’d spoken to days before in Los Angeles.  Polly, Elinor, Eric. I couldn’t see everyone, tried to take it all in, felt overwhelmed.
And suddenly everybody was rushing over throwing arms around me, happy birthday being shouted out in surround sound.  Tears started to flow as I hugged each one back, and as I tried to stop the tears from ruining my mascara, it was impossible to stem the emotional tidal wave I was feeling.  All my friends in one place, just for me.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Legal action taken by the estates of both Jack Kerouac &amp; Neal Cassady has halted the auction originally scheduled for December 17th and the document is being turned over to a court of law to allow a judge to decide on ownership and copyright issues. To the best of our knowledge a court date has not yet been set.</div><div><br/></div><div>The legal action halting the auction leaves our Indiegogo campaign in limbo. According to Indiegogo we can not suspend or cancel a campaign once it has started. Because of these circumstances, we are committing to the following:</div><div>1). All funds eventually realized from this campaign will go into a special account that will be used for no other purpose until the disposition of the auction is determined.</div><div>2). If there is an auction in the future, we will renew our efforts to raise additional money to place a bid on and hopefully win The Joan Anderson Letter. We are still working with private funders toward this end.</div><div>3). If the court determines the legitimate ownership of the letter in a fashion that does not lead to a public auction, all funds raised in this campaign will revert to the secondary purpose originally articulated at the beginning of this campaign, i.e. to fund a future Beat Generation Conference in San Francisco.</div><div>Jerry Cimino, The Beat Museum (jerry at kerouac . com)</div><div><br/></div><ul>

<p>Considered lost for 60 years, this is the famous letter by Neal Cassady that inspired a generation of Beat writers. It was recently found and we want to preserve it for posterity by bidding on the letter at auction in 2 weeks (Dec 17th, 2014).</p><p>These Beat Generation Scholars &amp; Authors want to see The Joan Anderson Letter protected, exhibited to the public and published so everyone can read it. So do we. With your help we have a chance!</p>

<a name=""why"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Why Is It Important the Beat Museum Wins This Auction?</h3>
<p>The world wants to read this letter. That may never happen, however, because the copyright holder may never get the opportunity to publish it. The reason is because whomever buys this letter will have sole access to the ""words"" on the letter and, whomever that person or organization turns out to be, they may deem it in their best interest to never allow the copyright holder access to the words! This is a very real possibility. Knowing the letter is out there, and knowing only a small handful of people have ever read the letter may have just enough allure for some potential bidders to buy it and lock it away as that might possibly make the letter appear more valuable to some people. If that were to happen it would be a great loss to the world at large, and to Beat fans and scholars specifically.</p>
<br/>
<h3>
<a name=""ourcommitment"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Our Commitment to the Cassady Estate &amp; to the Public at Large</h3>
<p>Our commitment is if The Beat Museum is the successful bidder of the Profiles in History auction for the Joan Anderson Letter, we will make the contents of the entire letter available to the copyright holder (presumably Neal &amp; Carolyn Cassady's three children, aka The Neal Cassady Estate) free and without charge so they may exercise their copyright. The decision to publish the letter, when, and in what form, will belong to the copyright holder. The Beat Museum has already been contacted by several major publishers interested in publishing this important document and we will work with the copyright holder to whatever level they desire to ensure publication of this important document.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1075212/files/20141205223120-Jerry___John_Onstage.jpg?1417847480"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""font-size: .8em;"">Jerry Cimino &amp; John Allen Cassady during 2005 Performance</p><p>In addition, The Beat Museum commits to the Beat Generation and the scholarly community: we will make the original letter available for study and examination (as appropriate, and after it has been examined by a preservationist), as well as allowable facsimile versions to scholars, biographers and other writers in the field of Beat Literature.</p><p>Lastly, we commit we will do everything in our power to allow the public and the world at large to view and see The Neal Cassady Letter. The world deserves to see this important document.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""I got the idea for the spontaneous style of <em>On the Road </em>from seeing how good old Neal Cassady wrote his letters to me, all first person, fast, mad, confessional, completely serious, all detailed … The letter, the main letter I mean, was forty thousand words long, mind you, a whole short novel. It was the greatest piece of writing I ever saw, better’n anybody in America, or at least enough to make Melville, Twain, Dreiser, Wolfe, I dunno who, spin in their graves … Neal and I called it, for convenience, the Joan Anderson Letter.""</p>

<h3>
<a name=""chance"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>The Beat Museum Really Have a Chance to Win the Auction?</h3>
<p>We have a saying around The Beat Museum: “You never make the shot you don’t take.” This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and we feel we at least have to try. Yes, we are doing it on very short notice. Yes, this entire campaign is evolving and changing every day. Yes, we may very well be bidding in the company of some extremely wealthy people. But yes, we have a chance.</p><p>There is always a chance! Someone or some organization is going to win this auction on December 17th. That’s a given. And it's possible someone, who most people believe is going to win, may for whatever reason, decide to take a pass. You never know how events may transpire. All you can do is take your shot when you have it.</p>
<br/>
<h3>
<a name=""whyparticipate"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Why Should I Participate?</h3>
<p>Because it’s fun!</p>
<p>You’re buying an experience by supporting us in this campaign. All of us here at The Beat Museum have been having the time of our lives these past two weeks. Since the day it was announced that the letter had been found it’s been electric around here. You can feel it in the air as you walk in the door. There is an excitement that is contagious. Because of this news we've seen a sharp increase in foot traffic at The Beat Museum and everyone who comes by, even people here for the first time whom we’ve never met before, pick up on the excitement quickly. It’s like the energy and spirit of Neal Cassady himself is making the rounds, transferring from person to person.</p>
<p>Yes, it is possible all you'll walk away with is a T-shirt or whatever perk you select, but you’ll also walk away with memories, and knowing that for a brief period of time you were a part of something bigger than yourself. You became part of a collective, you’ve joined a cadre of Beat Generation fans from around the globe who want to see this spirit live on. </p>
<br/>
<h3>
<a name=""whysohigh"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Why Are Your Award Levels So High?</h3>
<p>We’re trying to raise an awful lot of money in a very short period of time to be competitive in this auction and this entire plan came together so fast we want to err on the side of caution. Plus, some of our perks will need to be manufactured and they will need to be packed and shipped all over the world. The Beats have a very broad appeal worldwide and while shipping a T-shirt or a book here in the United States may only cost $5, shipping that same item to other countries might cost $25 or even $35. For that reason we elected to go with the higher pricepoint to ensure all shipping costs are covered. After all, it would do us little good in trying to attain our goal of bidding on and winning the Neal Cassady Joan Anderson Letter if too high a proportion of the monies raised had to go to shipping and handling.</p>
<br/>
<h3>
<a name=""whenrewards"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>When Should I Expect My Rewards?</h3>
<p>You should not expect any reward to be shipped until some time in January, possibly even February for certain items. We’ll need to coordinate book signings, get T-shirts and other perks made, packed, and shipped. There will be a lot of work on the back end to complete our commitments and obligations, but we will complete them. Just don’t tell Grandma she should be expecting her Neal Cassady shirt for Christmas!</p>
<br/>
<h3>
<a name=""othersources"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Will You Be Raising Money from Any Other Sources?</h3>
<p>Yes, we hope to raise other monies from private sources and donations that we will be able to add to the funds pledged through this campaign.</p>
<p>We also expect a significant amount to be pledged to a separate, private fund by philanthropists, celebrities and other lovers of Neal Cassady, Jack Kerouac and the Beat Generation.</p>
<br/>
<h3>
<a name=""refund"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Will I get a refund if you don't win the auction?</h3>
<p>No. We're going all out to win this auction, but there is no guarantee that we'll succeed. You're purchasing an item of value, and you will receive that item whether or not we are able to bid on the auction, and whether we win the auction or not.</p>
<br/>
<h3>
<a name=""enoughtobid"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>What Makes You Think You Can Raise Enough Money to Bid?</h3>
<p>In 2011, the white dress Marilyn Monroe wore in the movie <em>The Seven Year Itch</em> was put up for auction. A group came forward to create a crowd funding campaign of Marilyn Monroe fans who raised enough money to actually bid $3,100,000 on the dress. Their bid was unsuccessful as the winning bid for the dress topped $4,600,000, but their efforts proved the model can work toward its ultimate goal.</p>
<br/>
<h3>
<a name=""notenoughtobid"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>What if You Do Not Raise Enough Money to Bid?</h3>
<p>If we do not raise enough money to bid, then we simply cannot bid. The opening bid is $300,000 and our goal amount of $500,000 would allow us to do that, even after we factor in the buyer’s premium (commission charged by the auction house) insurance, legal fees and accounting fees.</p>
<br/>
<h3>
<a name=""nowin"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>What if the Beat Museum Does Not Win the Auction?</h3>
<p>Even if we don't win the auction or are unable to bid for any reason out of our control, your donation will still make great things happen! We’ll put the money you and others have contributed toward launching our Beat Generation Annual Conference Program, starting in the Summer of 2015. You will still collect the prize you signed up for, and you'll know that no matter what happens, you will have contributed in helping to spread the spirit of The Beat Generation.</p>
<br/>
<h3>
<a name=""annualconference"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>What Is the Beat Generation Annual Conference Program?</h3>
<p>Some of the best times many of us have ever had relating to The Beats has been at conferences:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Beat Generation Conferences at NYU in 1994 and 1995 could be called a ""last gathering of the Beats,"" which included Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Anne Waldman, Harold Norse, Michael McClure, Gregory Corso, and Hunter S. Thompson.</li>
<li>Lowell Celebrates Kerouac is an annual event in Lowell, Massachusetts, and includes readings, musical performances, tours of Kerouac's hometown, and appearances by Beat personalities such as David Amram.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <i>Beat Generation Annual Conference Program </i>will establish a similar Beat conference in San Francisco, and will feature appearances by remaining Beats, readings, symposia, movies, music, and more! </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1070111/files/20141204001045-Beat_Shindig.jpg?1417680645"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/></p>
<br/>
<h3>
<a name=""whyjanuary"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>If the auction occurs on December 17th, why are you running this campaign until January?</h3>
<p>From what we understand, Indiegogo does not release any funds for use until a few weeks after a campaign has ended. For this reason, it really doesn't matter when we end our 'Lost Letter' campaign on Indiegogo because the monies will not be in our hands until after the auction has completed.</p>
<p>On the morning of December 17th we will know exactly how much money has been pledged and this will give us an indication of how much we'll be able to bid the day of the auction. Before we actually bid one of the two following possibilities will have been prearranged so we can bid to win the auction. Either an arrangement with Profiles in History for a later payment based upon the funds that are showing in the Indiegogo account or we will have made an arrangement with one of our wealthy patrons or celebrity friends to guarantee our bid.</p>
<br/><br/><p>* Please Note:</p>
<p>Throughout this document we continually refer to The Beat Museum, but for purposes of clarity and full disclosure please be aware the operating entity and the bidder for the auction is The Foundation for Creative Expression 501(c)3 nonprofit (IRS ID number 74-3198671).

It would be devastating to lose another piece of San Francisco history.""</p>-<b>Melanie Samay</b>, the Contemporary Jewish Museum</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>""The ""Joan Anderson Letter""  is one of the cultural treasures of 20th century American letters, and it would be healthy and right for the general literate public to have access to it - both to see the original and to read it in fully published form.  I encourage you to consider aiding The Beat Museum in its quest - and extend the same encouragement to whoever does win this prize to take the public trust into account.""</p>-<b>Dennis McNally</b>, author, ""Desolate Angel/Jack Kerouac, The Beat Generation, and America.""<br/><p><br/></p>
<p>""When I heard the Joan Anderson letter had been found, I felt a surge of excitement that I could read and study this ""missing link"" in BEAT scholarship followed by an immediate concern it would be bought by a private collector and never been seen by readers, fans and BEAT students. I fervently believe this precious resource belongs at the BEAT MUSEUM where it can be seen, shared and further the cause of BEAT scholarship.

<p><br/></p>
<p>“Over the years, Allen Ginsberg and I spoke about the Joan Anderson Letter many times and I know he would be both happy and relieved to learn that it was not lost as he had feared.  He felt guilty that it disappeared on his watch, but now the mystery has been solved.  It truly is the letter that gave birth to the Beat Generation as a literary movement and changed Jack Kerouac's perspective on writing in a most dramatic way.  This artifact deserves to be shared with the legions of readers who will be able, at long last, to recognize the amazing influence that Neal Cassady had on the movement and revel in his genius.  I hope it will become available to one and all.”</p>-<b>Bill Morgan</b>, author, ""The Typewriter is Holy"" and ""Howl on Trail""<br/><p><br/></p>
<p>“If there is one place on the face of the planet where the Joan Anderson Letter should reside it’s in North Beach, the heart of Beat-dom. And the Beat Museum is the heart of that heart.”</p>-<b>Byron Spooner</b>, Friends of the SF Public Library</blockquote><p></p><br/>

</ul></div>","12/14/14 - A Special Note:The situation with The Neal Cassady ""Joan Anderson Letter"" has changed dramatically since we launched this campaign a few weeks go. Legal action taken by the estates of both Jack Kerouac & Neal Cassady has halted the auction originally scheduled for December 17th and the document is being turned over to a court of law to allow a judge to decide on ownership and copyright issues. To the best of our knowledge a court date has not yet been set.The legal action halting the auction leaves our Indiegogo campaign in limbo. According to Indiegogo we can not suspend or cancel a campaign once it has started. Because of these circumstances, we are committing to the following:1). All funds eventually realized from this campaign will go into a special account that will be used for no other purpose until the disposition of the auction is determined.2). If there is an auction in the future, we will renew our efforts to raise additional money to place a bid on and hopefully win The Joan Anderson Letter. We are still working with private funders toward this end.3). If the court determines the legitimate ownership of the letter in a fashion that does not lead to a public auction, all funds raised in this campaign will revert to the secondary purpose originally articulated at the beginning of this campaign, i.e. to fund a future Beat Generation Conference in San Francisco.Jerry Cimino, The Beat Museum (jerry at kerouac . com)

It was recently found and we want to preserve it for posterity by bidding on the letter at auction in 2 weeks (Dec 17th, 2014).These Beat Generation Scholars & Authors want to see The Joan Anderson Letter protected, exhibited to the public and published so everyone can read it. So do we. With your help we have a chance!

Why Is It Important the Beat Museum Wins This Auction?
The world wants to read this letter. That may never happen, however, because the copyright holder may never get the opportunity to publish it. The reason is because whomever buys this letter will have sole access to the ""words"" on the letter and, whomever that person or organization turns out to be, they may deem it in their best interest to never allow the copyright holder access to the words! This is a very real possibility. Knowing the letter is out there, and knowing only a small handful of people have ever read the letter may have just enough allure for some potential bidders to buy it and lock it away as that might possibly make the letter appear more valuable to some people. If that were to happen it would be a great loss to the world at large, and to Beat fans and scholars specifically.


Our Commitment to the Cassady Estate & to the Public at Large
Our commitment is if The Beat Museum is the successful bidder of the Profiles in History auction for the Joan Anderson Letter, we will make the contents of the entire letter available to the copyright holder (presumably Neal & Carolyn Cassady's three children, aka The Neal Cassady Estate) free and without charge so they may exercise their copyright. The decision to publish the letter, when, and in what form, will belong to the copyright holder. The Beat Museum has already been contacted by several major publishers interested in publishing this important document and we will work with the copyright holder to whatever level they desire to ensure publication of this important document.Jerry Cimino & John Allen Cassady during 2005 PerformanceIn addition, The Beat Museum commits to the Beat Generation and the scholarly community: we will make the original letter available for study and examination (as appropriate, and after it has been examined by a preservationist), as well as allowable facsimile versions to scholars, biographers and other writers in the field of Beat Literature.Lastly, we commit we will do everything in our power to allow the public and the world at large to view and see The Neal Cassady Letter. The world deserves to see this important document.

""I got the idea for the spontaneous style of On the Road from seeing how good old Neal Cassady wrote his letters to me, all first person, fast, mad, confessional, completely serious, all detailed … The letter, the main letter I mean, was forty thousand words long, mind you, a whole short novel. It was the greatest piece of writing I ever saw, better’n anybody in America, or at least enough to make Melville, Twain, Dreiser, Wolfe, I dunno who, spin in their graves … Neal and I called it, for convenience, the Joan Anderson Letter.""
-Jack Kerouac, The Paris Review




The Beat Museum Really Have a Chance to Win the Auction?
We have a saying around The Beat Museum: “You never make the shot you don’t take.” This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and we feel we at least have to try. Yes, we are doing it on very short notice. Yes, this entire campaign is evolving and changing every day. Yes, we may very well be bidding in the company of some extremely wealthy people. But yes, we have a chance.There is always a chance! Someone or some organization is going to win this auction on December 17th. That’s a given. And it's possible someone, who most people believe is going to win, may for whatever reason, decide to take a pass. You never know how events may transpire. All you can do is take your shot when you have it.


Why Should I Participate?
Because it’s fun!
You’re buying an experience by supporting us in this campaign. All of us here at The Beat Museum have been having the time of our lives these past two weeks. Since the day it was announced that the letter had been found it’s been electric around here. You can feel it in the air as you walk in the door. There is an excitement that is contagious. Because of this news we've seen a sharp increase in foot traffic at The Beat Museum and everyone who comes by, even people here for the first time whom we’ve never met before, pick up on the excitement quickly. It’s like the energy and spirit of Neal Cassady himself is making the rounds, transferring from person to person.
Yes, it is possible all you'll walk away with is a T-shirt or whatever perk you select, but you’ll also walk away with memories, and knowing that for a brief period of time you were a part of something bigger than yourself. You became part of a collective, you’ve joined a cadre of Beat Generation fans from around the globe who want to see this spirit live on. 


Why Are Your Award Levels So High?
We’re trying to raise an awful lot of money in a very short period of time to be competitive in this auction and this entire plan came together so fast we want to err on the side of caution. Plus, some of our perks will need to be manufactured and they will need to be packed and shipped all over the world. The Beats have a very broad appeal worldwide and while shipping a T-shirt or a book here in the United States may only cost $5, shipping that same item to other countries might cost $25 or even $35. For that reason we elected to go with the higher pricepoint to ensure all shipping costs are covered. After all, it would do us little good in trying to attain our goal of bidding on and winning the Neal Cassady Joan Anderson Letter if too high a proportion of the monies raised had to go to shipping and handling.


When Should I Expect My Rewards?
You should not expect any reward to be shipped until some time in January, possibly even February for certain items. We’ll need to coordinate book signings, get T-shirts and other perks made, packed, and shipped. There will be a lot of work on the back end to complete our commitments and obligations, but we will complete them. Just don’t tell Grandma she should be expecting her Neal Cassady shirt for Christmas!


Will You Be Raising Money from Any Other Sources?
Yes, we hope to raise other monies from private sources and donations that we will be able to add to the funds pledged through this campaign.
We also expect a significant amount to be pledged to a separate, private fund by philanthropists, celebrities and other lovers of Neal Cassady, Jack Kerouac and the Beat Generation.


Will I get a refund if you don't win the auction?
No. We're going all out to win this auction, but there is no guarantee that we'll succeed. You're purchasing an item of value, and you will receive that item whether or not we are able to bid on the auction, and whether we win the auction or not.


What Makes You Think You Can Raise Enough Money to Bid?
In 2011, the white dress Marilyn Monroe wore in the movie The Seven Year Itch was put up for auction. A group came forward to create a crowd funding campaign of Marilyn Monroe fans who raised enough money to actually bid $3,100,000 on the dress. Their bid was unsuccessful as the winning bid for the dress topped $4,600,000, but their efforts proved the model can work toward its ultimate goal.


What if You Do Not Raise Enough Money to Bid?
If we do not raise enough money to bid, then we simply cannot bid. The opening bid is $300,000 and our goal amount of $500,000 would allow us to do that, even after we factor in the buyer’s premium (commission charged by the auction house) insurance, legal fees and accounting fees.


What if the Beat Museum Does Not Win the Auction?
Even if we don't win the auction or are unable to bid for any reason out of our control, your donation will still make great things happen! We’ll put the money you and others have contributed toward launching our Beat Generation Annual Conference Program, starting in the Summer of 2015. You will still collect the prize you signed up for, and you'll know that no matter what happens, you will have contributed in helping to spread the spirit of The Beat Generation.


What Is the Beat Generation Annual Conference Program?
Some of the best times many of us have ever had relating to The Beats has been at conferences:

The Beat Generation Conferences at NYU in 1994 and 1995 could be called a ""last gathering of the Beats,"" which included Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Anne Waldman, Harold Norse, Michael McClure, Gregory Corso, and Hunter S. Thompson.
Lowell Celebrates Kerouac is an annual event in Lowell, Massachusetts, and includes readings, musical performances, tours of Kerouac's hometown, and appearances by Beat personalities such as David Amram.

The Beat Generation Annual Conference Program will establish a similar Beat conference in San Francisco, and will feature appearances by remaining Beats, readings, symposia, movies, music, and more! 


If the auction occurs on December 17th, why are you running this campaign until January?
From what we understand, Indiegogo does not release any funds for use until a few weeks after a campaign has ended. For this reason, it really doesn't matter when we end our 'Lost Letter' campaign on Indiegogo because the monies will not be in our hands until after the auction has completed.
On the morning of December 17th we will know exactly how much money has been pledged and this will give us an indication of how much we'll be able to bid the day of the auction. Before we actually bid one of the two following possibilities will have been prearranged so we can bid to win the auction. Either an arrangement with Profiles in History for a later payment based upon the funds that are showing in the Indiegogo account or we will have made an arrangement with one of our wealthy patrons or celebrity friends to guarantee our bid.

Beat Scholars Endorsing The Beat Museum Lost Letter Campaign:

""Neal Cassady's famous letter needs to be preserved, displayed and published. I can't think of anywhere better for the execution of these tasks than the Beat Museum.""-Dave Moore, editor of ""Collected Letters, 1944-1967 by Neal Cassady""
""I'm the poet who did NOT throw Neal's pages off my Sausalito barge some fifty years ago. I read it then and know that ""The Lost Letter"" needs to be published as a genuine relic and that it obviously belongs in ""The Beat Museum.""-Gerd Stern, the guy who 'lost' the letter
""Let’s make 2015 the 65th Anniversary of Joan Anderson letter and have the chance to finally all read it.""
-David Amram, friend of Jack Kerouac
""Securing of this seminal document by The Beat Museum would assure not only its availability for viewing, but would assure its publication as well. The importance of such a publication cannot be underestimated in the Kerouac/Cassady world, as well as in the annals of 20th Century American Literature.""-Steve Edington, 20+ year member of the Lowell Celebrates Kerouac Committee, past LCK President, and author of ""Kerouac's Nashua Connection"" and ""The Beat Face of God""
""Neal Cassady wrote this letter in San Francisco where he drew from the spirit of the place and time — and the letter should stay in San Francisco. The Beat Museum is the ideal place for its display, where thousands of people can witness the spirit in its context.""-Matt Theado, author of ""The Beats: A Literary Reference"" and ""Understanding Jack Kerouac""
""The Joan Anderson letter belongs here, in San Francisco, where people can view it every day, where it would be published for all to read. This letter needs a home, and a good steward and I can’t think of a better place than the Beat Museum. It would be devastating to lose another piece of San Francisco history.""-Melanie Samay, the Contemporary Jewish Museum
""The ""Joan Anderson Letter""  is one of the cultural treasures of 20th century American letters, and it would be healthy and right for the general literate public to have access to it - both to see the original and to read it in fully published form.  I encourage you to consider aiding The Beat Museum in its quest - and extend the same encouragement to whoever does win this prize to take the public trust into account.""-Dennis McNally, author, ""Desolate Angel/Jack Kerouac, The Beat Generation, and America.""
""When I heard the Joan Anderson letter had been found, I felt a surge of excitement that I could read and study this ""missing link"" in BEAT scholarship followed by an immediate concern it would be bought by a private collector and never been seen by readers, fans and BEAT students. I fervently believe this precious resource belongs at the BEAT MUSEUM where it can be seen, shared and further the cause of BEAT scholarship. We can't risk the loss of this letter into a private holding. Otherwise, it will be like it was never found.""
-Brenda Knight, editor, ""Women of The Beat Generation""

“Over the years, Allen Ginsberg and I spoke about the Joan Anderson Letter many times and I know he would be both happy and relieved to learn that it was not lost as he had feared.  He felt guilty that it disappeared on his watch, but now the mystery has been solved.  It truly is the letter that gave birth to the Beat Generation as a literary movement and changed Jack Kerouac's perspective on writing in a most dramatic way.  This artifact deserves to be shared with the legions of readers who will be able, at long last, to recognize the amazing influence that Neal Cassady had on the movement and revel in his genius.  I hope it will become available to one and all.”-Bill Morgan, author, ""The Typewriter is Holy"" and ""Howl on Trail""
“If there is one place on the face of the planet where the Joan Anderson Letter should reside it’s in North Beach, the heart of Beat-dom. And the Beat Museum is the heart of that heart.”-Byron Spooner, Friends of the SF Public Library

<p> </p></div>","Hi!
We are Zenith Writers, a writing organization created by teen librarians and writers Leah Parker and Kara Seal from Centennial, Colorado. We want to help aspiring young adult (YA) writers improve their skills by creating a writing center specifically geared towards their genre--the first of its kind in the Denver metro area. Our goal is to begin teaching courses by January 2013, but we need your help.
We need to raise $20,000 to cover the start-up costs of a location, classroom equipment, and instructors. So, we're turning to the supporters of teen books to ask for contributions. In exchange, we're offering free classes, webinars, or ten page critiques. Your contribution will help us to accomplish our dream of teaching YA focused writing classes, and further, it will support young adult writers of all ages who are unable to find courses intended solely for them. 
Thanks! Leah & Kara

Herbal tinctures specifically for cancer patients cost $80 for a one week supply; other supplements recommended for chemo patients start at around $30-$60 per week each and up and there are six of them.

<h2>Be among the first to get Mr. Gibraltar, the Ebook!</h2>
<h3><strong>SEE MY SLIDESHOW LINK IN BLUE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE</strong></h3>
<h3>Why:</h3>
<p>A number of years ago I was in my final university class and the professor had all the students write a short story that they were passionate about.  My professor was an expert in publishing and editing and had himself written over 200 articles that had been published.  I wrote the story about what at the time was a very scary event that happened to me when I was a teenager.  Upon reviewing my paper, the professor commented to me that ""this is good enough to be published.""  He gave me a couple of options for submitting the paper to different magazines and shortly thereafter I graduated.  He instilled in me a great desire to write my first book.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today.  I have finally put together the pieces of the puzzle enough to now ask for your help in pre-selling my Ebook titled:  Mr. Gibraltar.</p>
<h3>What:</h3>
<p>Mr. Gibraltar is the story of one man's quest for love, truth, and an amazing connection to his past.  It chronicles Thomas Gibraltar's quest for truth as he tries to uncover who killed his father and why.  Along the way he meets and falls in love with a beautiful woman, something he had missed out on all his life.  And finally he is able to uncover a method of communicating with his deceased father who in turn tries to help him cope with life, love, and his new found method of communication.  Its a thrilling fiction novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat with tons of action, romance, and twists and turns.  Buy your copy of the ebook today!</p>
<h3>Who:</h3>

For years, the book, <em>Oneness, </em>has been gifted with love from friend to friend, all over the world. Now, it’s time to take the Oneness teachings beyond those grassroots beginnings, and help them reach the awakening worldwide audience this life-changing spiritual wisdom was intended for. Your support, whether in the form of a financial contribution or simply by getting the word out through social media, is so appreciated!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>              About the book, <em>A Journey to Oneness</em></strong></h2>
<p>In <em>A Journey to Oneness</em> Rasha takes us along on a fascinating seven year odyssey through the labyrinths of consciousness. With the wisdom of Oneness as guide and Guru, this candid, revealing glimpse into the spiritual journey of a modern-day Messenger takes the reader the full distance from the abyss of radical material loss and the systematic dissolution of the linear identity, to the ecstatic heights of God Realization.</p>
<p>Rich with Divine insight and mind-stretching metaphysical concepts, this work traces the evolution of an emerging spiritual Master in a way that speaks directly to the inner quest of each of us. The loving guidance of Oneness, woven throughout the story, serves to awaken the sacred sense of Divine connectedness that waits within us all. The simple act of reading becomes a personal journey that the reader shares on an intimate <em>experiential</em> level.</p>
<h3><strong>An Overview of the Book:</strong></h3>
<p><em>A Journey to Oneness </em>begins in 1998, by taking Rasha from the sweet success of a blossoming New Age jewelry business in the mountains of North Carolina, to a nightmare of shattered dreams and sudden financial ruin. In time, she’ll come to understand the significance of the radical loss of the material trappings of identity as a classic pre-cursor to spiritual awakening. But now, caught in the grasp of the volatile energies of transformation and the living theatre it creates, she watches in shocked disbelief as life as she knows it totally self-destructs. Suddenly homeless, she finds the safe harbor of a surreal, inherited condo in a village for the elderly in South Florida, where the transcription of the Divine Revelations in the landmark book, <em>Oneness</em>, begins.</p>
<p>Crisscrossing the landscape of America in a vintage van named “Vanessa”, this colorful journey goes on to take Rasha from the high-profile hoopla of the Whole Life Expo lecture circuit to the life of a spiritual recluse, tucked away in the remote mountains of the Northern New Mexico desert. There, lost in timeless moments of Divine ecstasy for days-on-end, she completes the transmissions for the book <em>Oneness</em>. The book is the culmination of a marathon four-year exercise in spiritual unfoldment, and no sooner is it finished, than the real journey begins.</p>
<p>An inner calling merges with the voice of destiny, and in a radical gesture of non-attachment, Grandpa’s Florida condo—and all tethering to a recognizable past—is cashed-in for a ticket to India. An odyssey unfolds and a spiritual quest springs to life with an unforgettable cast of exotic characters. Rasha takes us on a three year, virtual tour of spiritual India in what might be titled “The Murphy’s Law Guide to Awakening.” As Oneness deftly helps her circumnavigate the potholes along the road to “freedom,” and gives us a startling new vision of the nature of the changes now taking place within us all, the reader is given a crystal clear roadmap of the inner path to enlightenment.</p>
<p>A literary tapestry, colored by recurring bouts of disbelief, doubt, and a logical mind’s probing questions over what is actually happening as it unravels—woven seamlessly with the poetry and rapture of Divine Union—the story takes us for an authentic ride on the roller-coaster of spiritual transformation.</p>
<p>Three voices: the Divine Presence of Oneness, the voice of the full-spectrum, “linear identity” of Rasha, and the overview of the narrator, harmonize into a shared vision. The Journey culminates in the experience of Oneness as <em>the Self</em>. Along the way, there are vivid guest appearances, as unique <em>channeled</em> guidance, of some of the most significant spiritual luminaries of our times. As a seasoned channel, Rasha shares some of her personal, channeled conversations with Neem Karoli Baba, Osho, Anandamayi Ma, The Christ, and the Hindu monkey God, Hanuman.</p>
<p>Here, in five hundred pages of ground-breaking material, are the answers to the timeless questions that have challenged humankind to probe beyond the scientifically <em>provable</em> and unearth the realm of the <em>experiential</em> and the unquestionable. Here, in one woman’s unforgettable story is the key to the mysterious momentum of <em>change </em>suddenly unfolding within the depths of each of us, and within the world we share. Page by page, <em>A Journey to Oneness</em> takes us all hand-in-hand to common ground: the extraordinary <em>experience</em> of Oneness.  </p>

<h3>What does it take to publish and promote a new book these days?</h3>
<p>Printing and distributing books are the barest beginnings of what it takes to launch a new title in today's rapidly evolving world of publishing. Now the focus has shifted to a far broader scope: the added potential of a vibrant new world of e-books and audio books; Facebook and YouTube; websites and interactive blogs; teleseminars and social media. It's a technological publishing environment filled with promise and exciting new possibilities for reaching a worldwide audience with a life-changing message like the teachings of Oneness; an unprecedented opportunity for reaching more people, building links and creating community! At the same time, the new opportunities for spreading the word have created a need for technical support with the specialized know-how it now takes to bring a new book to life!</p>
<p>Until recently, it was still possible for a self-published author to coordinate all the aspects of publishing and promoting a book the old-fashioned way ... singlehanded. Working on a shoestring budget from South India, Rasha self-published the second edition of <em>Oneness</em> in 2003. And she's been handling all the details of printing, distributing and promoting the books, writing and designing the content for the Oneness website, <a href=""http://www.onenesswebsite.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.onenesswebsite.com</a>, and creating the two beautiful, free e-mail series by herself, ever since. (All this while continuing to transcribe the teachings of Oneness, of course.)</p>
<p>Now as Rasha prepares to launch <em>A Journey to Oneness</em> in today's totally transformed publishing environment, and reach out to a vast, rapidly expanding spiritual audience, she realizes that she can't do it alone anymore. To give the message of Oneness the outreach and momentum that's now possible, she’s going to need help. Naturally, she thought of you ... and hopes you'll be open to supporting the launch of this amazing new book!</p>
<p><strong>We invite you to join Rasha by adding your own personal contribution to the energy of this effort, and help bring <em>A Journey to Oneness </em>to life!</strong></p>

<p>A modern-day Messenger, and author of the spiritual classic, <em>Oneness</em>, Rasha has worked as a courier of Divine guidance for over twenty years. In early 1998, she began a profound dialogue with the universal Presence, “Oneness”—the Divinity we all share. Word for word, she transcribed the principles that give us a new level of understanding of the mystery we call “life.” These teachings empower us to take a quantum leap into our own inner depths and totally transform our lives and our world. <em>Oneness</em> has sold over 100,000 copies in the US, by word-of-mouth alone, and has seven foreign language editions.</p>
<p>Rasha awakened to her inner-calling as a Divine Messenger in 1987. Her spiritual teachers emerged from <em>within</em> her and in the years that followed, she was taken step by step through the sacred journey to Oneness and through the life-altering changes that are shaking the foundation of today’s world. As a Messenger with a life-changing message, she has dedicated her life to addressing the global spiritual awakening that is the hallmark of these times. Rasha is not affiliated with any established spiritual path, religion or guru. Her teachings are universal and focus on the personal <em>experience</em> of the Divinity within each of us.</p>
<p>Now, the website, <a href=""http://www.onenesswebsite.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.onenesswebsite.com</a> has begun to bring those teachings to the eyes of the world. There, thousands of readers have signed-up for the beautiful, photographic “Wisdom of Oneness Messages” and the “A Moment of Oneness” audio e-mail series. Thousands more have watched and shared the beautiful flash movie, “Oneness: The Movie” which now has had nearly 120,000 views on YouTube.</p>
<p>An incurable world-traveler, Rasha divides her time between the remote mountains of Northern New Mexico and the mystical hills of South India. There, in blessed silence, life is filled with the joys of transcribing the words of Oneness for future volumes.</p>

              About the book, A Journey to Oneness
In A Journey to Oneness Rasha takes us along on a fascinating seven year odyssey through the labyrinths of consciousness. With the wisdom of Oneness as guide and Guru, this candid, revealing glimpse into the spiritual journey of a modern-day Messenger takes the reader the full distance from the abyss of radical material loss and the systematic dissolution of the linear identity, to the ecstatic heights of God Realization.
Rich with Divine insight and mind-stretching metaphysical concepts, this work traces the evolution of an emerging spiritual Master in a way that speaks directly to the inner quest of each of us. The loving guidance of Oneness, woven throughout the story, serves to awaken the sacred sense of Divine connectedness that waits within us all. The simple act of reading becomes a personal journey that the reader shares on an intimate experiential level.
An Overview of the Book:
A Journey to Oneness begins in 1998, by taking Rasha from the sweet success of a blossoming New Age jewelry business in the mountains of North Carolina, to a nightmare of shattered dreams and sudden financial ruin. In time, she’ll come to understand the significance of the radical loss of the material trappings of identity as a classic pre-cursor to spiritual awakening. But now, caught in the grasp of the volatile energies of transformation and the living theatre it creates, she watches in shocked disbelief as life as she knows it totally self-destructs. Suddenly homeless, she finds the safe harbor of a surreal, inherited condo in a village for the elderly in South Florida, where the transcription of the Divine Revelations in the landmark book, Oneness, begins.
Crisscrossing the landscape of America in a vintage van named “Vanessa”, this colorful journey goes on to take Rasha from the high-profile hoopla of the Whole Life Expo lecture circuit to the life of a spiritual recluse, tucked away in the remote mountains of the Northern New Mexico desert. There, lost in timeless moments of Divine ecstasy for days-on-end, she completes the transmissions for the book Oneness. The book is the culmination of a marathon four-year exercise in spiritual unfoldment, and no sooner is it finished, than the real journey begins.
An inner calling merges with the voice of destiny, and in a radical gesture of non-attachment, Grandpa’s Florida condo—and all tethering to a recognizable past—is cashed-in for a ticket to India. An odyssey unfolds and a spiritual quest springs to life with an unforgettable cast of exotic characters. Rasha takes us on a three year, virtual tour of spiritual India in what might be titled “The Murphy’s Law Guide to Awakening.” As Oneness deftly helps her circumnavigate the potholes along the road to “freedom,” and gives us a startling new vision of the nature of the changes now taking place within us all, the reader is given a crystal clear roadmap of the inner path to enlightenment.
A literary tapestry, colored by recurring bouts of disbelief, doubt, and a logical mind’s probing questions over what is actually happening as it unravels—woven seamlessly with the poetry and rapture of Divine Union—the story takes us for an authentic ride on the roller-coaster of spiritual transformation.
Three voices: the Divine Presence of Oneness, the voice of the full-spectrum, “linear identity” of Rasha, and the overview of the narrator, harmonize into a shared vision. The Journey culminates in the experience of Oneness as the Self. Along the way, there are vivid guest appearances, as unique channeled guidance, of some of the most significant spiritual luminaries of our times. As a seasoned channel, Rasha shares some of her personal, channeled conversations with Neem Karoli Baba, Osho, Anandamayi Ma, The Christ, and the Hindu monkey God, Hanuman.
Here, in five hundred pages of ground-breaking material, are the answers to the timeless questions that have challenged humankind to probe beyond the scientifically provable and unearth the realm of the experiential and the unquestionable. Here, in one woman’s unforgettable story is the key to the mysterious momentum of change suddenly unfolding within the depths of each of us, and within the world we share. Page by page, A Journey to Oneness takes us all hand-in-hand to common ground: the extraordinary experience of Oneness.

                                        About Rasha                         and the Teachings of Oneness

 
                                                 
A modern-day Messenger, and author of the spiritual classic, Oneness, Rasha has worked as a courier of Divine guidance for over twenty years. In early 1998, she began a profound dialogue with the universal Presence, “Oneness”—the Divinity we all share. Word for word, she transcribed the principles that give us a new level of understanding of the mystery we call “life.” These teachings empower us to take a quantum leap into our own inner depths and totally transform our lives and our world. Oneness has sold over 100,000 copies in the US, by word-of-mouth alone, and has seven foreign language editions.
Rasha awakened to her inner-calling as a Divine Messenger in 1987. Her spiritual teachers emerged from within her and in the years that followed, she was taken step by step through the sacred journey to Oneness and through the life-altering changes that are shaking the foundation of today’s world. As a Messenger with a life-changing message, she has dedicated her life to addressing the global spiritual awakening that is the hallmark of these times. Rasha is not affiliated with any established spiritual path, religion or guru. Her teachings are universal and focus on the personal experience of the Divinity within each of us.
Now, the website, www.onenesswebsite.com has begun to bring those teachings to the eyes of the world. There, thousands of readers have signed-up for the beautiful, photographic “Wisdom of Oneness Messages” and the “A Moment of Oneness” audio e-mail series. Thousands more have watched and shared the beautiful flash movie, “Oneness: The Movie” which now has had nearly 120,000 views on YouTube.
An incurable world-traveler, Rasha divides her time between the remote mountains of Northern New Mexico and the mystical hills of South India. There, in blessed silence, life is filled with the joys of transcribing the words of Oneness for future volumes.

You know Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka—now meet Africa’s

This is the first book of its kind.
There are a few anthologies of African literature, but none of them focus on young writers, and none of them feature interviews plus short stories. Gambit is wholly unique!!
The stories in Gambit reflect the nuances that arise from living in a post-postcolonial Africa, where stereotypes are crumbling and writers are willing to tackle themes that are more social than political. Furthermore, unlike other anthologies, Gambit's writers are mostly based in their home countries, putting them closer to the social themes they lyrically confront.

We hope that the interviews in this volume not only shed light on the experiences and inspirations of the authors, but also encourage young writers to take up the pen and share their stories.
Reading literature from around the world helps to bridge cultural divides and increase understanding and appreciation of other cultures and experiences.

</h3> <p>On this day, September 11th, 2014, it is with great humility, very clear Divine Guidance, and mustering a lot of courage from the encouragement of some wonderful supporters that this leap of faith is being taken.</p>
<p>My name is Antonio Aversano. On September 11th, 2001, my dear Dad Lou was killed during the attacks on the World Trade Center. That day reshaped the lives of many people around the world. For me, with the (now clearly Divinely guided) transformational ways that Me and my Dad healed and grew our relationship in the two years prior to his death, the day of his passing became  a  Soul and Spiritual Catalyst tied to a web of Life Lessons that continue to ripple forth to this Day.</p>
<p>From the encouragement of some special people in my life, and a Divine calling that has been beckoning since 2002, ""From Ashes To Light"" is an attempt to: 1) Share many of the Life Transforming stories and perspectives that have risen through me from the ashes of 9/11/01;  2) Offer insights and new perspectives for people (including some of my own family) who might be struggling with loss or are simply stuck in the ""fear of our time"" in hopes the Love that flows along with these words and insights might shed some Light through the darkness and offer a bigger picture of what is  possible for human beings and our lives together here on planet Earth; and 3) By taking this leap of faith I am opening to a new level of healing and wholeness in my life by sharing my deepest truths around the loss of my Dad and the unique ways Life seems to have offered Spiritual Lessons through this tragedy that are wanting to be shared with the world. Sharing such perspectives that might serve others in some way, ease the suffering, and make the world a better place is the Highest Calling of my Soul. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Making This A Reality <br/>
</h3> <ul>
<li>I have never published a book before so, again, this is a leap of faith as far as how long reaching completion is going to take or how much in resources it might require to make this a reality. And, I have already researched the self-publishing options at Balboa Press, so I am hoping that (if I can raise even close to my funding goal), that will cover the basics.<br/>
</li> <li>Basically, however much I raise will determine how big of a publishing package I 
am able to choose and how much time (outside of my other projects that pay the bills) I can devote to putting this together - sooner or
 later. (^_^)  <br/>
</li> <li>I envisioned   what I hope will be some unique offerings including some personal options to allow me to Soul Serve you with some of the Soul Inspiring gifts that I was put on this Earth to share with others.<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Supporting A Larger Vision<br/>
</h3> <p>I believe we are at a unique time on planet Earth. It feels to me we are ending an era of living in illusions based in fear, survival, and of feeling like (and living like) ""isolated bags of skin, dragging around a dreary ego"". I believe we are on the verge of  a new era of all people recognizing, honoring, and celebrating the immense beauty, gifts, and possibilities of our existence. I believe we are moving towards the vision of what I call ""A Possible Planet"" that is nothing less than the very best visions that all Human Beings hold in their Hearts - a world where all basic needs are met and where all people are living joyfully free, at peace, and in harmony with each other and all of Life on planet Earth. <br/></p>
<p>It is this vision that you are supporting by supporting this book as the words and messages that lie within the pages are speaking to that very possibility and represent some of the small steps that  I was offered - in an unlikely way through the tragedy of 9/11 and the loss of my Dad - to move towards that vision in my own Life. <br/></p>
<p>This vision is the guiding star of my life and is at the foundation of all the ways I have successfully and will continue to serve others and the Awakening of our world.<br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Overcoming Obstacles</h3>
<p>It seems that all roads are pointing towards, NOW! I have been so blessed over the last 10 years of my life to have been guided by amazing teachers, mentors, friends, family, supporters, and many empowering experiences. When I look back, I see how it all fits together in this moment - from the many Spiritual Journey's, to the numerous Professional Trainings, to the recent experiences of being inspired by a Divine Writing Mentor, aligning with an Angel of a book editor, having multiple communities of creative support, and being blessed by a Business Coach with endless compassion and wisdom. I feel there is nothing in the way of the success of this project. All I have to do is show up and it is going to happen. And, starting this campaign IS the catalyst of saying YES to the blessings of bringing this to Life. </p>

<li>If you are inspired in any way by what I've shared so far, it would be a great support for this project to get the word out and share with your friends about this campaign.</li> <li>There are plenty of Indiegogo share tools to use here. Go for it!<br/>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>Hello All,</i></p>
<p><i>Thank you so
much for taking the time to visit my campaign page! For those of you who don't
know me, my name is Virginia A. Davis; I am a Head Start Teacher, a poet, creative writer, advocate for Literacy, and an aspiring novelist. Since I was a
teenage girl, I have been strongly captivated by the art of transcribing my
imaginary ideas, fictitious characters, and real-life experiences to paper. As
a young girl and as an adult, I have spent many nights pouring out the depths
of my soul onto the lined pages of my notebook, while simultaneously staining
the paper with tears of despair and hope. I am forever grateful that I fell in
love with writing and words, for they have both served as perpetual driving
forces in my life. </i></p>
<p><i>I have always
had an insistent desire to make a positive impact on the lives of others through
the words of my creative literature. A few months ago, the plot of this children’s </i><i style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">novel dropped on my heart almost out of nowhere. Before this story was
complete, I knew that it was going to positively affect the lives of many young
boys and girls who may be suffering from low self-esteem, self-doubt, or
hopelessness. As an avid writer, I have composed a variety of short stories,
poems, and potential books; out of the enormous creative content that I have
amassed, I am certain that this story will serve as an immeasurable uplift
and inspiration to our younger generation.</i></p>
<p><i>Unfortunately,
in today’s society we have cultivated a stern belief of what is beautiful and
what is not. We have adopted an unfair reasoning of what and who is acceptable,
and who and what is not. There are a multitude of young women, men, boys, and
girls who are affected by the narrow-mindedness of our beliefs, and view
themselves as inadequate or inferior. Growing up, I, too had these derogatory,
painful thoughts about myself, and was often hurt by the words and actions of
others toward me.</i></p>
<p><i> I wrote this inspiring story based
off of my own real-life experience of dealing with low self-esteem as a young
girl and as an adult. The road has been tough, but I learned to accept and
glorify myself, even if others do not accept or value all of my attributes. It is my belief, that the content of this book will teach another how young child how to overcome the same obstacles. </i></p><p><i style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""> I strongly believe that
this book will immensely impact many of our troubled youth who feel that
there is no one who cares for them and can relate to their pain. I deeply yearn
to reach out to that hurt child who feels rejected by their peers, family
members, associates, and society as a whole. I truly feel compelled to touch
the heart of the pained child who thinks that they are inadequate and does not
believe in himself. I hope to let a trouble youth know that they are far from inadequate, and that anything is possible for them if they love and believe in themselves. By reading this book, many of our youth
will cultivate a stronger and higher value of themselves, and will attain a confidence
that will be invaluable to them throughout the course of their lifetimes.  </i><br/></p>
<p><i>With the help of
a few caring individuals, we can change the lives of many children and young adults.
We can offer a book of hope to an individual who may bask in hopelessness, and empower
someone who feels powerless. This is more than a children’s book on the
horizon; it is a touching story and movement that will evoke positive change
in the lives of many.</i></p>
<p><i>Thank you so
much for your time, and I hope that you are inspired to contribute to my cause.
Please see below for the desired amount to raise for the publication of the

<p></p><br/><p></p></div>","Hello All,
Thank you so
much for taking the time to visit my campaign page! For those of you who don't
know me, my name is Virginia A. Davis; I am a Head Start Teacher, a poet, creative writer, advocate for Literacy, and an aspiring novelist. Since I was a
teenage girl, I have been strongly captivated by the art of transcribing my
imaginary ideas, fictitious characters, and real-life experiences to paper. As
a young girl and as an adult, I have spent many nights pouring out the depths
of my soul onto the lined pages of my notebook, while simultaneously staining
the paper with tears of despair and hope. I am forever grateful that I fell in
love with writing and words, for they have both served as perpetual driving
forces in my life. 
I have always
had an insistent desire to make a positive impact on the lives of others through
the words of my creative literature. A few months ago, the plot of this children’s novel dropped on my heart almost out of nowhere. Before this story was
complete, I knew that it was going to positively affect the lives of many young
boys and girls who may be suffering from low self-esteem, self-doubt, or
hopelessness. As an avid writer, I have composed a variety of short stories,
poems, and potential books; out of the enormous creative content that I have
amassed, I am certain that this story will serve as an immeasurable uplift
and inspiration to our younger generation.
Unfortunately,
in today’s society we have cultivated a stern belief of what is beautiful and
what is not. We have adopted an unfair reasoning of what and who is acceptable,
and who and what is not. There are a multitude of young women, men, boys, and
girls who are affected by the narrow-mindedness of our beliefs, and view
themselves as inadequate or inferior. Growing up, I, too had these derogatory,
painful thoughts about myself, and was often hurt by the words and actions of
others toward me.
 I wrote this inspiring story based
off of my own real-life experience of dealing with low self-esteem as a young
girl and as an adult. The road has been tough, but I learned to accept and
glorify myself, even if others do not accept or value all of my attributes. It is my belief, that the content of this book will teach another how young child how to overcome the same obstacles.  I strongly believe that
this book will immensely impact many of our troubled youth who feel that
there is no one who cares for them and can relate to their pain. I deeply yearn
to reach out to that hurt child who feels rejected by their peers, family
members, associates, and society as a whole. I truly feel compelled to touch
the heart of the pained child who thinks that they are inadequate and does not
believe in himself. I hope to let a trouble youth know that they are far from inadequate, and that anything is possible for them if they love and believe in themselves. By reading this book, many of our youth
will cultivate a stronger and higher value of themselves, and will attain a confidence
that will be invaluable to them throughout the course of their lifetimes.  
With the help of
a few caring individuals, we can change the lives of many children and young adults.
We can offer a book of hope to an individual who may bask in hopelessness, and empower
someone who feels powerless. This is more than a children’s book on the
horizon; it is a touching story and movement that will evoke positive change
in the lives of many.
Thank you so
much for your time, and I hope that you are inspired to contribute to my cause.
Please see below for the desired amount to raise for the publication of the
book, and check out the awesome perks to the right! All monies received will go toward the publication of the novel only.
****For
publication of the book we need a grand total of $1,300. However, we can
feasibly reach our deadline if you assist me in spreading the word of my cause . PLEASE UTILIZE THE INDIEGOGO SHARE BUTTON! If you can
contribute, or even if you desire to and can’t, please tell someone else about

</li>
<li>I read and hear the stories of how the rich and famous deal with medical problems, addictions, theft and whatnot... the only problem is the rest of us can not afford to approach life in the same manner.  While their story may be heartwarming, it is not actually helpful.  I want to change that.  I want to give real people real stories.  I want people to be able to read my magazine and say, ""Wow, I'm not the only one!"" or ""I never thought of that"", etc.  I want to explore the hows and whys of life, and to share with everybody out there that we are not so different after all.</li>
<li>If I can reach my goal it will really be a dream come true.  I have already built my website, obtained my DBA, I have an accounting program and  have started writing my stories.  I have 2 regional  photographers willing to trade their services for full credit in the magazine, and I have people scheduled for interview on stories for 3 future issues.</li>
</ul><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><ul>
<li>I have set a goal of $4500.  $1200 of it is for the software for the actual magazine, and it is a lifetime license. I really want this particular program because it allows me to offer actual print copies and makes the subscription process a dream. My motto is ""A magazine reaching out to everyone, everywhere, every month"" and I would not be living up to that if I only offer digital. Approx $1000 for additional software and printing applications. $1000 will be for the remainder of the legal steps needed... copyright, registration, contracts and such. The remaining money will go towards fees, supplies and advertising.The funding I am asking for gets me the actual last things I need, nothing more.  Anything over my goal will be directed right into the magazine for equipment, articles and advertising, and also back to this site to help someone with their project.  I will not take if I can not give.  I will donate in the name of the magazine, We Are... Magazine.</li>
<li>The perks range from free digital issues and your name in the magazine for 6 months all the way to a year of free issues, a free print copy, your name as a contributor listed for the life of the magazine and 10% of total profit with a financial statement through December 2015!!</li>
<li>If I do not reach my goal, all funds I do receive will go towards the legal documents I have left to get and a less expensive program to publish the magazine, but I will not be able to offer print copies and streamline the process for a more efficient business model. </li>
<li>I have done a lot of work and research on my project, I just need a little help!</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><ul>
<li>I can't remember the number of times I started talking to someone about something and we said to each other ""so it's not just me!"" and felt better that someone else was going through the same thing AND we discussed it and helped each other out!  This magazine can do that on a global level, and it can only grow over time.</li>
<li>I want more ""real"" in entertainment and information, not more ""reality"".  I want something positive out there that reaches out to men and women, parents and children.  Not all stories have a ""happy ending"" because not all life happenings have one, and I believe that will connect with people because it is honest.  </li>
<li>People will never be altered in photos, stories will not be changed to make them more interesting, attention grabbing and/or scandalous. We will not discuss the Hollywood crowd and their antics.  We will not put people up on a pedestal then attack them when they fall.  There will never be unauthorized stories or pictures. </li>
<li>The advertising in the magazine will feature small businesses and private/family owned shops, no corporate advertising.  There will be a section of positive product reviews, or items that really work, and I will use the real/full name of the product.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><ul>
<li>Please spread the word and visit the magazine's website too!  <a href=""http://www.weare-magazine.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.weare-magazine.com</a>

If I can reach my goal it will really be a dream come true.  I have already built my website, obtained my DBA, I have an accounting program and  have started writing my stories.  I have 2 regional  photographers willing to trade their services for full credit in the magazine, and I have people scheduled for interview on stories for 3 future issues.
What We Need & What You Get
I have set a goal of $4500.  $1200 of it is for the software for the actual magazine, and it is a lifetime license. I really want this particular program because it allows me to offer actual print copies and makes the subscription process a dream. My motto is ""A magazine reaching out to everyone, everywhere, every month"" and I would not be living up to that if I only offer digital. Approx $1000 for additional software and printing applications. $1000 will be for the remainder of the legal steps needed... copyright, registration, contracts and such. The remaining money will go towards fees, supplies and advertising.The funding I am asking for gets me the actual last things I need, nothing more.  Anything over my goal will be directed right into the magazine for equipment, articles and advertising, and also back to this site to help someone with their project.  I will not take if I can not give.  I will donate in the name of the magazine, We Are... Magazine.
The perks range from free digital issues and your name in the magazine for 6 months all the way to a year of free issues, a free print copy, your name as a contributor listed for the life of the magazine and 10% of total profit with a financial statement through December 2015!!
If I do not reach my goal, all funds I do receive will go towards the legal documents I have left to get and a less expensive program to publish the magazine, but I will not be able to offer print copies and streamline the process for a more efficient business model. 
I have done a lot of work and research on my project, I just need a little help!
The Impact
I can't remember the number of times I started talking to someone about something and we said to each other ""so it's not just me!"" and felt better that someone else was going through the same thing AND we discussed it and helped each other out!  This magazine can do that on a global level, and it can only grow over time.
I want more ""real"" in entertainment and information, not more ""reality"".  I want something positive out there that reaches out to men and women, parents and children.  Not all stories have a ""happy ending"" because not all life happenings have one, and I believe that will connect with people because it is honest.  
People will never be altered in photos, stories will not be changed to make them more interesting, attention grabbing and/or scandalous. We will not discuss the Hollywood crowd and their antics.  We will not put people up on a pedestal then attack them when they fall.  There will never be unauthorized stories or pictures. 
The advertising in the magazine will feature small businesses and private/family owned shops, no corporate advertising.  There will be a section of positive product reviews, or items that really work, and I will use the real/full name of the product.

imagenes y portadas. No  incluye la impresión de libros, ya que se imprimen
según su demanda en el  mercado (self publishing).


 Los costos por la edición y lectura del material,
han sido donados.


 Este es un proyecto en proceso y el
manuscrito será entregado a  AuthorHouse, en unos 30 días. Me gustaría tener el

3 TOP FAQs (More FAQs are below)



What will you do with funds above $5000? We'll build a better app. We'd like to add the ability to read the book in the app, track how users use the app so we can learn how to best use the augmented reality, and enable the user to take a selfie photo or video dancing with 3D Pacha. 


What is the problem you are solving? Most Children's Entertainment is mental junk food. It may satisfy cravings but it is making kids sick.


Why should I support this project?  This project aims to catalyze a shift towards ""nutritious"" children's entertainment that supports the healthy social and emotional development of today's children. Our vision is for all kids to have access to mind blowing, culturally-relevant, age-appropriate entertainment as they develop into young adults.  






Hello from Melia, Aaron, Dre, Allah, David, and Dave!

Our groundbreaking Animated Book Pacha's Pajamas: A Story Written By Nature is being published on April 5th. We need your help to make the launch a resounding success.
The story of a young girl whose pajamas take her on dream adventures to learn more about herself and bring her unique gifts to the world...
We are doing this 5 day crowdfunding campaign because we need to finish development of the Pacha Alive app that animates the book. This campaign is a key part of gaining the momentum we need to make the Animated Book a bestseller. 
Now is the time to step up for children, innovation in reading, diversity in books, social and emotional learning, climate action, and Pachamama. If we can make Pacha's Pajamas a bestseller, it will clear a pathway for more healthy children's entertainment.  





  We need a minimum of $5K to finish the development of the app. 
If we get $10K, we will add some more features to the app including the capability to take a selfie with Pacha and hire a couple of young people to do outreach for the best seller campaign. If we get more than $10K, we will put it into he bestseller campaign. 
If we don't reach our entire goal, whatever funds we get will be used to make the best app we can. Be the first to get the new Pacha's Pajamas Animated Book. Our unique perks include 20 signed Pre-Release copies of Pacha's Pajamas that you will have before the April 5th publishing date. 
We also are offering the opportunity to be made into a cartoon character and even be in a short animation with Pacha.  

  




Our Animated Book inspires kids and families to discover their unique gifts and bring them to the world. It encourages them to explore their connection with the natural world and to create the world they want to live in. It also models youth leadership and climate action.
The Pacha's Pajamas music in the Animated Book has won 9 awards.



 
Our biggest risk is selecting an developer that is unable to deliver in time for the launch. To mitigate this risk, we are going through a rigorous selection process with support from the service Upwork.com.    


Join our Thunderclap campaign to get the word out.
Send an email to your circle of friends sharing the campaign and/or sing them to pre-order the animated book. I will send you a blurb.  


Pre-order the Animated Book on Amazon or another online retailer before April 12th

Connect us with infuential people and organizations that may want to support the launch 
Please get the word out and make some noise about our campaign using the Indiegogo share tools!

What is Nutritious Children's Entertainment? Nutritious children's entertainment supports the healthy social and emotional development of today's kids, recognizing that today's kids are the first growing up as digital natives. What medicine do they need? What medicine are they getting? What kind of messages do you want your kids to be exposed hours a day? That's nutritious children's entertainment. Not only does it taste great, but its good for kids. 

What is impact of the augmented reality? As in the Animated book, multimedia technologies like augmented reality can increase story comprehension and expressive vocabulary especially for disadvantaged children according a  2015 Leiden University study.

What did the 2015 Leiden University study find? It found additional benefit in technology for story comprehension and expressive vocabulary. Multimedia features like animated
pictures, music, and sound effects were found beneficial. In contrast, interactive elements like hotspots, games, and dictionaries were found to be
distracting. Especially for children disadvantaged because of less stimulating family environments, multimedia features were helpful and interactive

<p><strong>Thank you so much to those who pledged! </strong>Because of you, I am on my way to attending the Writers Workshop in Paris.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Visit my blog for updates on my trip. </strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://coreymp.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://coreymp.wordpress.com/</a><br/></strong></p>
<p>Almost three years ago, I was diagnosed with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_neuralgia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trigeminal Neuralgia</a>, a rare nerve disorder that causes debilitating pain. Last November, thanks to my wonderful neurosurgeon, and the support and love of my family, I got my life back after undergoing a successful brain surgery. With all that behind me, I am ready to embrace life and chase my dream of becoming a published writer.</p>
<p>Hi. My name is Corey. I am a stay-at-home mom, writer and blogger. I wrote my first poem at 14 years old. Poetry was my first love. Years later, I discovered my passion for writing stories. I’m currently in the process of editing my first novel and in the midst of writing my second one.</p>
<p>For the last two years, I have been dreaming of going to Paris to attend a Writers Workshop and to finish writing my second novel, which takes place in the City of Light. I am excited to announce that now that I am pain-free, I am finally going to Paris this June, but for a limited time and on a limited budget. I still need a little more support, which is why I created my writing campaign called, Poetry for Paris.</p>
<p><strong>Poetry for Paris</strong> aims to help me raise funds to make this writing trip happen. The idea is I will write a poem for each person who pledges at least $25. Each poem will be featured on my blog at: <a href=""http://coreymp.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">coreymp.wordpress.com.</a></p>
<p><strong>Where the money goes:<br/></strong>The money I hope to raise will go towards the workshop fee (650 Euro = approximately 850 in US Dollar). I am hoping to raise $800 before June.</p>
<p>If I exceed my goal, the rest of the money raised will go towards editing services for one of my books.</p>
<p><strong>The perks!<br/></strong>Depending on your pledge, the perks could include a poem written by me, especially for you, or a dvd of my favorite movie, <em>Midnight</em> <em>in</em> <em>Paris</em> and/or a book from Shakespeare and Company with a personal dedication from me, and/or I name a character in my book after you!</p>
<p>Aside from attending the workshop, any free time I get during my short stay in Paris, will be dedicated to finishing my second novel, <em>Hearts and Errors</em>. I am hoping that a glimpse of the city, a quick stroll along the Seine river, a few cups of coffee at Café de Flore, possibly a nightcap at the Shakespeare and Company bookstore, will be all I need to fill the holes in my story.</p>
<p><strong>Hearts and Errors</strong> is about a hopeless romantic from Manhattan who flees to Paris in search of a Matchmaker she read about in an old magazine article.</p>
<p>Leaving everything behind, with nothing but a suitcase and a broken heart, she desperately walks the streets of Paris hoping to find what she thinks she is looking for, but fate has other plans.</p>
<p><strong>May I write you a poem?<br/></strong>If you pledge at least $25, I will write a poem, especially for you. Just give me your first name and one word (maybe your favorite word, or any word). All poems will be featured on a page on my blog called, <a href=""http://coreymp.wordpress.com/poetry-for-paris/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Poetry for Paris</a>. Look for your poem under your name.</p>
<p>Although I have not written a poem in years, I am willing to take a risk and pour my heart out in order to reach my goal. Any pledge would mean the world to me. Thank you for your support.</p>
<p>Check my <a href=""http://coreymp.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> for updates on my upcoming trip.</p>

Poetry for Paris aims to help me raise funds to make this writing trip happen. The idea is I will write a poem for each person who pledges at least $25. Each poem will be featured on my blog at: coreymp.wordpress.com.
Where the money goes:The money I hope to raise will go towards the workshop fee (650 Euro = approximately 850 in US Dollar). I am hoping to raise $800 before June.
If I exceed my goal, the rest of the money raised will go towards editing services for one of my books.
The perks!Depending on your pledge, the perks could include a poem written by me, especially for you, or a dvd of my favorite movie, Midnight in Paris and/or a book from Shakespeare and Company with a personal dedication from me, and/or I name a character in my book after you!
Aside from attending the workshop, any free time I get during my short stay in Paris, will be dedicated to finishing my second novel, Hearts and Errors. I am hoping that a glimpse of the city, a quick stroll along the Seine river, a few cups of coffee at Café de Flore, possibly a nightcap at the Shakespeare and Company bookstore, will be all I need to fill the holes in my story.
Hearts and Errors is about a hopeless romantic from Manhattan who flees to Paris in search of a Matchmaker she read about in an old magazine article.
Leaving everything behind, with nothing but a suitcase and a broken heart, she desperately walks the streets of Paris hoping to find what she thinks she is looking for, but fate has other plans.
May I write you a poem?If you pledge at least $25, I will write a poem, especially for you. Just give me your first name and one word (maybe your favorite word, or any word). All poems will be featured on a page on my blog called, Poetry for Paris. Look for your poem under your name.
Although I have not written a poem in years, I am willing to take a risk and pour my heart out in order to reach my goal. Any pledge would mean the world to me. Thank you for your support.
Check my blog for updates on my upcoming trip.

<p>Durch die Begriffe <strong>""Mindestabnahmemenge"" </strong>und <strong>""Mindermengenzuschlag""</strong>welche bei Produzenten oder Herstellern gängig ist. Als Endverbraucher, kleiner Fisch und kleiner Zwischenhändler, zahlen wir oft weitaus höhere Preise für unsere Produkte, als die großen Fische wie z.b.

<p>Das Fazit liegt nahe: Kleine Endverbraucher und Zwischenhändler müssen<strong> sich</strong> <strong>zusammentun</strong> und <strong>gemeinsam einkaufen</strong> um <strong>bessere Preise</strong> an den Märkten zu erzielen.</p>
<p>Unsere Online-Plattform nutzt das Internet, um <strong>Endverbrauchern und Zwischenhändlern ein Forum zu bieten</strong>, in dem sie sich <strong>als Kaufgemeinschaften zusammenschliessen</strong> und so ihre Produkte billiger bekommen als im Einzelhandel. Oder einfach gesagt: Wenn wir (Endverbraucher und Zwischenhändler) als Gruppe einkaufen, bekommen wir mehr für unser Geld. <br/><br/><strong>Dies ist Euer Forum, von Verbrauchern und Zwischenhändlern für Verbraucher und Zwischenhändler</strong>. Zusammen nutzen wir das Internet, so dass wir letztendlich alle zu Grosshandelspreisen einkaufen können, und so die überhöhten Preise im Einzelhandel nicht länger in Kauf nehmen müssen. So werden wir nicht nur die besten Preise bekommen, letztlich werden wir als Verbraucher auch die Preise und Bedingungen mitbestimmen können, indem wir den Verkaufsketten durch unsere Kaufgemeinschaften Konkurrenz machen. <br/><br/>Hört sich unrealistisch oder gar unmöglich an? Wir, das Crowdla Team, wissen es ist nicht nur möglich, <strong>es ist sogar höchste Zeit,</strong> dass wir unsere Social Media Networks dazu benutzen, nicht länger nur willige Opfer der Preispolitik der Grosskonzerne zu sein sondern <strong>aktiv in offenen und fliessenden Interessengemeinschaften jeweils die besten und nachhaltigsten Märkte und Preise zu finden.</strong>    <br/><br/>Clickt auf unser Video, dann seht ihr an konkreten Beispielen, wie ihr profitieren und wie ihr das Projekt unterstützen könnt, damit es nicht nur eine schöne Idee bleibt sondern unsere Zukunft wird, in der wir als Kunden und Verbraucher das Sagen haben.<br/><br/><strong>Wir wollen in erster Linie, fair trade, organische und ökologische Produkte unterstützen und hoffen insbesondere Öko-Bauern und Anbietern aus der sogenannten dritten Welt mit diesem Forum direkten Kontakt zu den Endverbrauchern zu ermöglichen, so dass beide Seiten direkt profitieren können. Wir können gleichzeitig unserer Umwelt helfen, indem wir Transportkosten und CO2 Emissionen reduzieren. Indem wir direkt von der Quelle einkaufen, vermeiden wir Unmengen an Plastikverpackungen und Müll.</strong></p>

<li>My name is Jillian Ashe, and I am the author of this series. I'm hoping to write a full series of about ten books plus a few short stories that focus on each character. This series will happen no matter what, but with your contributions I can make sure there are no delays with the publication process.</li>
<li>Being an author has always been a dream of mine, and this was my first series. I want to tell it so badly, and to have you all read it. It's the story that I've wanted to read, but could never find while wandering the stacks in the bookstore. I've been told by complete strangers they loved the story, and that means more to me than anything ever could.</li>
<li>With your contributions it will keep me working, and able to pay people,  and pay for all those little things you never knew about.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>I can give you the story in raw, unedited format. That's how much this series means to me, getting it out no matter what. But...I want the experience of reading the series to be as pleasant as possible. I myself am an avid reader. I love fawning over a cover, reading the story, almost never tripping up over a typo (It happens in the big books more than you would think) and the rest of the world falling away. Here's what I need to give you that enjoyable experience:</p><ul>
<li>Editing - I'm not perfect. Sometimes what I send my editor is a far cry from the end product, and I need the funds to make sure the editor is paid. Without their help the books wouldn't be nearly as neat and clean, therefore not that enjoyable. Editors are worth the money.</li>
<li>Stock Images - Yes I make my own book covers to save money, but I am woefully under-prepared to create the good quality images my readers deserve. It's pretty expensive, but I want those awesome science fiction backgrounds for you just as much as it's for me.</li>
<li>Website fees - I purchased my own website domain and hosting site so it will always be there... as long as I keep paying my yearly fees. I keep my website up and running so my readers can stay connected to me, buy from me directly, and get cool free stuff.</li>
<li> ISBNs and Copyrights - Not too expensive, but adds up when you have to do it for each book and for each version. Digital ISBNs aren't always offered for free like they are when you do a print book on Amazon. This is so other people can find my work easier (ISBNs) and so other people can't try to sue me over my own stuff (copyrights).<br/>
</li>
<li>Perks and shipping - I will be initially paying for all the physical copies of the books, posters, etc. as well as the shipping to get them to me so that I can get ship them out to you. I do use priority flat rate shipping though so keep that in mind.</li>
<li>Fees, fees, and more fees - Indiegogo takes a percentage, the credit card companies take a percentage, Paypal takes a percentage....you get the idea.</li>
</ul><p>I tried to price each perk fairly so that all of the costs of each perk and the fees are covered with only a little extra to pay for the real purpose of the campaign. This is also a kind of ""pre-order"" for book 2 and 3 of the series. They will release no matter what, but the funds you contribute to receive them before their true release date will help book 4 and 5 come out on time.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Perks</h3><p>I currently don't ship internationally through Indiegogo because it's expensive and stressful, BUT if you really want it and live out of the US you can go to my website jillianashe.com and contact me. We can work it out on a person by person basis :). </p><ul><li>To be clear on the last perk...you get every eBook I publish in the Wolfegang series...plus what the physical hardbacks of the first three books. I will personally sign each copy. It's a commitment to the series as a whole, so beware.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Risks</h3><p>I personally don't see any risks as these three books will be published this summer regardless of any contributions. If you contribute, you will get the perk you contributed for regardless of if I make my goal or not. Nothing to lose, just saying :)</p><p></p><h3>Stretch Goal</h3><p>If I pass my goal listed above I will send everyone who contributed the eBook copy of a short story in the series based on one of my main characters. It is an ""Origin"" story, and you will receive it early just like everything else!</p><h3>Other Ways to Contribute</h3><p>Not everyone can afford to contribute, and I totally get that, but spread the word! Share the link, thrust it upon the readers in your life who like this kind of thing. Tell them about my the first book being free if they contact me through my website! Be excited! I love books, and people who love books can't shut up about their obsessions :)</p><p>Thank you to everyone who took the time to read this far!</p><br/><p></p></div>","What is the Series about?This is a young adult science fiction series that follows 22 year-old Katerina in her journey to find her brother when she wakes up 500 years in the future. She finds his letter and sets out to find him,  falling in with a crew of smugglers and treasure hunters.NOTE: If you head to my website jillianashe.com contact me if you're interested and I'll send you the first book FREE, Let me know if you want if for Kindle (Kindle likes to be special and require its own file) or any other reader (everyone else uses the same file) It's available pretty much everywhere, but might not be free. I have to fight Amazon and Nook to price match Kobo and iBooks, so it takes some time to filter through.The description for My Delicate Destruction: Book One of the Wolfegang series - ""My name is Katerina Anderson. In 2016, a drug called
Hope was created. Administered during suspended animation, the drug was
supposed to cure the cancer my twin brother and I had. When an earthquake
leveled Los Angeles, we were presumed dead.
Forgotten, we slept.
The day I woke up, I realized everything had changed.
My brother was missing, and everyone else I knew was dead. That drug and all
its false promises were the beginning of my destruction.""

<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Hello.</span><br/>
</h3><p>My name is Eveline, and I'm 17 years old. Last year, I was diagnosed with PTSD and dissociative spells due to repeated trauma.

In addition, I have panic attacks, flashbacks, nightmares, and a massive problem with hyper vigilance. This makes it very difficult for me to be at home, as I have to do routine safety checks every time I leave or enter a room, right before I go to bed, and as soon as I wake up.

<h3>(DOPUNJENO!)<br/>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Zašto ""Ja nisam Švabo!"" jesam ovdje?</h3>
<p>A zašto ne? Ovo je sasvim poštena ponuda gdje roman nastaje samo ako 
čitatelj to želi i - samim time - samo ako je autor siguran da će 
uspjeti podmiriti troškove tiskanja i distribucije romana.
</p>
<p>To stvara opuštenost koja uopće ne djeluje loše na spisateljsko 
nagnuće, a spremnost čitateljstva da financira izlaženje romana jest dodatni motiv, zapravo bveza da se roman dovrši. Naime, 
čitav reputacijski, pa i financijski rizik je na strani autora. </p>
<p>Međutim, ono najbolje što se dade dobiti iz ovakvoga načina financiranja 
jest stvaranje neovisne pozicije prema službenoj kritičarskoj, 
distribucijskoj i tiskarskoj struci. Pisac odgovara čitatelju, ""proizvođač"" ima obvezu prema ""kupcu"" koji - kao što<span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> je ponuđeno u načinima financiranja (""perks"") -  može u odgovarajućoj mjeri utjecati i na sadržaj romana.</span></p>
<h3>Kakav roman jesam ""Ja nisam Švabo!""?<br/>
</h3>
<span>Glavni lik romana je Eugen Udo Schläger - uspješan inženjer strojarstva, specijaliziran za vjetroturbine, viceprvak Njemačke u orijentacijskom trčanju, ekološki aktivist angažiran na održanju rijetkih vrsta, ljubitelj leptira ... Njegov miran život prestaje nakon što mu majka ostavlja oporučno pismo u kojemu mu priznanje kako Herbert Schläger nije njegov otac ""Ti nisi Švabo ... tvoj otac zove se Tvrtko Batina iz mjesta Batina u Hrvatskoj, u Dalmatinskoj Zagori"".</span>
<p><span>Udo kreće u potragu za korijenima, ali u Batini su manje-više svi Batine, a ni Tvrtko nije samo jedan. U ozračju karikaturalnih kulturoloških razlika te lokalnih, nacionalnih, običajnih i osobnih razmirica Udo se pokušava orijentirati. U dramatičnom košmaru pristajanja da vidi sebe u jednima i istodobnog poricanja da se prepozna u drugima, Udo se, tražeći oca, suočava čak i s bratoubilačkim, pače i  incestuoznim nagnućima. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>Obitelj ne možeš birati, ali u njegovu slučaju barem joj se možeš nadati - svaki trenutak njegovog traganja za identitetom je istodobno i odmicanje i primicanje od cilja.</span></p>
<p><span> Udo razotkriva Batinu, ali i Batina razotkriva njega. Tko je brži? Tko će prvi uzviknuti  ""Udo Schläger je Batina!""</span></p>
</div> <div> <h3>""Ja nisam Švabo!"", ali tko jest tvoj autor? <br/>
</h3> <p>Zovem se Vedran Kukavica. U 49.-oj sam  godini. Pedeset ću imati 31. listopada ove godine pa stječući tako većinsko vlasništvo nad vlastitim životom (50+1) želim taj dan obilježiti i izlaskom svog prvog romana ""Ja nisam Švabo"".</p>
<p>Bavio sam se novinarstvom - pisanim i televizijskim - marketingom, odnosima s javnošću i srodnim djelatnostima koje - po mom mišljenju - u današnjim prilikama ne pristaju odraslim osobama te ih u zrelijim godinama treba svakako gledati izbjeći ako baš nije nužno za preživljavanje.</p>
<p>O meni ćete štošta saznati koristeći internetske tražilice i moje javne profile na društvenim mrežama. Tamo i ovdje saznat ćete učas i kako ćete me kontaktirati. Ono što ne znate jest imam li ja doista ovaj roman u glavi, mogu li napisati dobru knjigu koju biste baš htjeli pročitati, dapače financirati.<br/></p>

Zašto ""Ja nisam Švabo!"" jesam ovdje?
A zašto ne? Ovo je sasvim poštena ponuda gdje roman nastaje samo ako 
čitatelj to želi i - samim time - samo ako je autor siguran da će 
uspjeti podmiriti troškove tiskanja i distribucije romana.

To stvara opuštenost koja uopće ne djeluje loše na spisateljsko 
nagnuće, a spremnost čitateljstva da financira izlaženje romana jest dodatni motiv, zapravo bveza da se roman dovrši. Naime, 
čitav reputacijski, pa i financijski rizik je na strani autora. 
Međutim, ono najbolje što se dade dobiti iz ovakvoga načina financiranja 
jest stvaranje neovisne pozicije prema službenoj kritičarskoj, 
distribucijskoj i tiskarskoj struci. Pisac odgovara čitatelju, ""proizvođač"" ima obvezu prema ""kupcu"" koji - kao što je ponuđeno u načinima financiranja (""perks"") -  može u odgovarajućoj mjeri utjecati i na sadržaj romana.
Kakav roman jesam ""Ja nisam Švabo!""?

Glavni lik romana je Eugen Udo Schläger - uspješan inženjer strojarstva, specijaliziran za vjetroturbine, viceprvak Njemačke u orijentacijskom trčanju, ekološki aktivist angažiran na održanju rijetkih vrsta, ljubitelj leptira ... Njegov miran život prestaje nakon što mu majka ostavlja oporučno pismo u kojemu mu priznanje kako Herbert Schläger nije njegov otac ""Ti nisi Švabo ... tvoj otac zove se Tvrtko Batina iz mjesta Batina u Hrvatskoj, u Dalmatinskoj Zagori"".
Udo kreće u potragu za korijenima, ali u Batini su manje-više svi Batine, a ni Tvrtko nije samo jedan. U ozračju karikaturalnih kulturoloških razlika te lokalnih, nacionalnih, običajnih i osobnih razmirica Udo se pokušava orijentirati. U dramatičnom košmaru pristajanja da vidi sebe u jednima i istodobnog poricanja da se prepozna u drugima, Udo se, tražeći oca, suočava čak i s bratoubilačkim, pače i  incestuoznim nagnućima. 
Obitelj ne možeš birati, ali u njegovu slučaju barem joj se možeš nadati - svaki trenutak njegovog traganja za identitetom je istodobno i odmicanje i primicanje od cilja.
 Udo razotkriva Batinu, ali i Batina razotkriva njega. Tko je brži? Tko će prvi uzviknuti  ""Udo Schläger je Batina!""
  ""Ja nisam Švabo!"", ali tko jest tvoj autor? 
 Zovem se Vedran Kukavica. U 49.-oj sam  godini. Pedeset ću imati 31. listopada ove godine pa stječući tako većinsko vlasništvo nad vlastitim životom (50+1) želim taj dan obilježiti i izlaskom svog prvog romana ""Ja nisam Švabo"".
Bavio sam se novinarstvom - pisanim i televizijskim - marketingom, odnosima s javnošću i srodnim djelatnostima koje - po mom mišljenju - u današnjim prilikama ne pristaju odraslim osobama te ih u zrelijim godinama treba svakako gledati izbjeći ako baš nije nužno za preživljavanje.
O meni ćete štošta saznati koristeći internetske tražilice i moje javne profile na društvenim mrežama. Tamo i ovdje saznat ćete učas i kako ćete me kontaktirati. Ono što ne znate jest imam li ja doista ovaj roman u glavi, mogu li napisati dobru knjigu koju biste baš htjeli pročitati, dapače financirati.
Ja sam uvjeren da mogu, znam i hoću.
 Izići ću lako na kraj sa svojim likovima, ugođajima, dijalozima i oporim humorom ovoga romana koji se krčka u mojim perifernim radnim memorijama desetljećima. ""Ja nisam Švabo"" - to je roman kojim ću pokazati kako fabula može biti pomalo banalna, a da poruka svejedno ostane duboka, kako se i nad šašavom stripovskom dinamikom priče može pustiti suza, kako baš svaki dijalekt može biti univerzalan i operativan, a kako mnoga emocija zna postati priličito neumjesna.

<h2>Story of My Book - Mirror Mania</h2>
<p>This book explores the intersection of body image insecurities and personal identity. It highlights just how much people tend to define their personal worth, and thus, the way they live their lives by a mere number on the scale. It explores how much media, specifically social media, has an influence on what we perceive as healthy.<br/><br/>My name is Roveena Jassal and I am the author of Mirror Mania. For almost my entire life, I have spent my days thinking about food, my weight, and what I looked like. I wanted to be skinnier, I wanted to disappear, because I couldn’t stand my own company. When I finally broke free and started to fill my life with love and passion, I knew I had to share my story with the rest of the world.<br/><br/>I wrote this book because I wanted to creatively construct a society that was based off of all of the mental anxieties that I endured. This book hones in on the injustice and discrimination that different sized people go through. I wrote this book because I wanted to highlight this prevalent issue that both men and women struggle with and the extent to which they do.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover just how much the constant pursuit for aesthetic perfection can consume you, and ultimately, become your primary life purpose. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with how media affects our identities and versions of what it means to be healthy. Reading this book is an opportunity to understand the minds of individuals who have struggled or continue to struggle with the way they look in their daily lives. However, it is also an escape from the pressures of modern society into a world filled with scientific fantasy. You will be able to learn alongside main characters Ropashna, Deslin, and Influencer Jeenz about the importance of compassion and moderation.<br/><br/><br/><strong>The story</strong>: Tech buttons that are injected as soon as you are born and monitor your vitals, chemically perfected macro friendly Cheetos, Greek god-like figures who are known as Influencers, and the all-knowing Facegram app that monitors all of society. This is Speculo City, a society that runs off of you hating yourself.<br/><br/>Mirror Mania is where the magic happens; it is the law, government, police, everything. Here, Influencers use their media expertise, not biology, to determine all of society’s body weights. You’re scrap if you’re below your lowest assigned weight, and you’re undesirable if you’re above your highest assigned weight in Speculo. Maybe, if Mirror Mania sees potential in you, they’ll ask you to donate yourself to extract your cartilage and fat that can be used for booty enhancement experiments. You’re not allowed in certain places and it is against the law to wear body flattering skinsuits or transformative bodyshorts. If you’re not perfect, why should you deserve the same privileges as someone who works hard to maintain their perfect midpoint weight?<br/><br/>However, like most destructive lifestyles, there comes a time when change is necessary; it is inevitable, in fact. From the land of Sezolu, Ropashna comes from a background of aromatic foods and colorful dress. Ropashna, a fearless and independent girl, seeks to completely destroy Mirror Mania by deceiving the Influencers as she becomes an undercover Influencer Intern. After spending her life being in the perfect midpoint weight, but then losing her closest friends and her self worth after reaching beyond her highest weight point, she has nothing more to lose.<br/><br/>But her motivation is questioned with a charming yet confused fellow named Deslin. From the land of Telotulu, with vibrant music and cheery people, Deslin was a plump child filled with love from his Mother’s traditionally cooked meals, like handmade cassava rolls and sautéed poken. After moving to Speculo City, he was inevitably bullied, but right before going to university, his rock hard abs make an appearance for the first time. Like Ropashna, he wants to intern at Mirror Mania, but does he want to destroy it? Or does he want to change it?<br/><br/>Influencer Jeenz comes in and changes the story. She introduces Deslin to how much power he can have, but also reminds him of how destructive Mirror Mania’s promoting lifestyle choices can truly be. Ropashna’s fearlessness inspires him, but maybe her approach is too radical. Maybe, it’s not about changing the mirror, but how you choose to see the mirror instead.</p>
<p><br/>You will love this book if you love a creative story that is applicable to real life. It is filled with references to pop culture, but also new inventions in a near futuristic world. Along with all of the sci-fi and body image talk, the story is frosted with love, deceit, humor, and friendship. The main characters are also from minority backgrounds too!<br/><br/>My book Mirror Mania speaks to young adults and adults who grapple with insecurities on what they look like and are struggling to define themselves in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Mirror Mania inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p>What does it really mean to be healthy?</p>
<p>How much does the media influence your sense of personal identity?</p>
<p>What do you let define you?</p>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing health, interpersonal relationships, media, and personal identity will change us all for the better.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - Mirror Mania</h2>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + Chapters 1-7. This section focuses on building the world of Speculo and establishing the relationships and humanizing Ropashna and Deslin. You will experience the scientific fantasy of how Mirror Mania runs Speculo City and become immersed in the minds of the characters. Scenes of how the internship selection works with constant scanning for meeting perfect midpoint weight requirements, to the annual Sacrifice Masquerade Ball, a gaudy party for Mirror Mania members only will keep you captivated and curious.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains Chapters 8-13. These chapters flesh out the main conflicts of the story for Ropashna, Deslin, and Influencer Jeenz. More juicy interactions explain the interesting romance between the characters, as Deslin begins working closer with Ropashna and Influencer Jeenz. Other minor characters are introduced, cellulite cream experiments take place, and a secret society develops because Ropashna can’t wait any longer to destroy Mirror Mania. You will feel shocked, intrigued, and empathetic all at once.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains Chapters 14-19. This section focuses on bringing all of the motivations of the characters together. A scandal breaks out and intoxication is involved. You will not be able to stop reading or trying to think about what will happen next. The questions of what happens to Ropashna’s goal, Deslin’s personal issues, and Influencer Jeenz involvement are all answered in this part.</p>

<p><strong>Women On Waves</strong> is the comprehensive history of the female wave-riding experience – performance, achievement, beach fashion, and feminine mystique in the world of surfing. There has never been a book that told the whole story about hundreds of thousands of women who surf.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While I was the editor and publisher of Surfer magazine we created more content on women surfing in Surfer than in all the time before or since. I always knew there was an audience of passionate female surf lovers – who were hungry for the real stories about women’s experience of wave riding. The positive response I received was enough to tell me the media was not doing enough to cover the amazing stuff going on out in the real world. I have been working on this project ever since then, and I know it will be something all wave lovers – but especially women – will enjoy.</p>
<p>As a the Editor of Surfer magazine, a Marketing Director at Quiksilver and the Media Director at Billabong and the President of the California Surf Museum I have been deep in the heart of women’s surfing for over four decades.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This work on the history of women’s surfing will be a definitive piece of surf culture and women’s sports history Anyone who is part of this effort will be a part of the history of surfing forever. Contributors will be making the most important reference about women’s surfing there is.</p>
<p>This is a legacy project for my part. It is what I will want to point to when someone asks what I contributed to surfing and to the society at large. And except for my family, there is nothing I love more than surfing – and I want to be able to say that the women who lived it got their just dues.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over 700 women are written about in this once-in-a-generation history. Make sure each one gets honored as part of this great surfing life. Let’s let the world know about these special people and how they each made a difference. The book is being published July 7th so there is no risk that the project will not be successful. We want all of the people involved – the photographers and people who worked to make this happen be able to see their work fulfilled. And we want to be able to make sure the millions of people out in the world know this book is here. We want to offer them a chance to be part of this effort.</p>

<div><b>(The Shit I've Done For Money)</b></div> <p><b>WHAT:</b></p>
<p>Are You There Craigslist? It's Me, Pearl"" is a book of Craigslist emails that reveal my search for work to survive as an artist in San Francisco. This intimate compilation of emails is ridiculous, mundane, comical, desperate, repetitive, sad, and vulnerable. It is a book for your coffee table, bedside table, toilet-side table, and beach towel for that easy to read poolside book. With the influence of the popular Found books, and the honesty of Amy Shumer, these email exchanges highlight my search for work on Craigslist. From my attempt to get hired as a cupcake decorator, to my success at getting my ass painted as a Rutabaga, to my rejection of a creepy man looking for a blues dancing partner, this book lets you see all the crazy bullshit I thought about, attempted, and succeeded in, while hustling to SURVIVE. </p>
<p><b>SO?</b></p>
<p>So, my next step in this process--I need your help to get this manuscript turned into a book, complete with selected pictures I sent accompanying some of these emails! </p>
<p><b>WHO ARE YOU?? Why is this exciting?</b></p>
<p>My name is Pearl Marill and I'm a San Francisco based choreographer, actress, and writer. I've been living in the Bay Area for a decade. In these 10 years, I've been performing, producing, directing, and creating original work in the form of live theater, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp9mdEh0SKY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">short films</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkutmR5UJc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">music videos</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg6G233yALs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sketch comedy</a>.  My passion lies in the fusion of theater improvisation, modern dance, and comedy. Craigslist has always been a rich source of inquiry for me, and I won an Isadora Duncan Dance Award in 2012 for a piece based off the Missed Connections section of Craigslist, called<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoKVKtfNwoY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">  Missed Connection.</a></p>
<p>To survive as an artist anywhere is a challenge. To stay eating as an artist or just anyone that isn't involved in Tech in San Francisco is a HUGE challenge. I've compiled my decade long collection of email threads that document my consistent hustle for work and put it into a manuscript. I wanted to publish these emails for a few reasons.</p>
<p>1) I've received the Theater Bay Area and Dancer's Group Ca$h Fund that I'm using to select 5 artists to create new works using text from the manuscript. The dates for that show are SET! These artists will be presenting work at <a href=""http://www.pianofight.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pianofight </a>in San Francisco on May 27 and 28 and the performances are to hopefully accompany the book release of ""Are You There Craigslist? It's Me, Pearl."" </p>
<p>2) The catharsis of purging your inbox and sent box to produce a creative project is great. </p>
<p>3) Like many artists, I fall under the category of being depressed when I'm not engaged in a creative endeavor. This project was a way for me to avoid depression, and make lemonade from lemons. </p>
<p>4) Survival mode is real. It's funny to be a voyeur and be privvy to all the crazy shit people do for money. </p>
<p>5) This is a path to broadening my channels and realizing the great world that exists outside of Craigslist. To create this book helps to hold myself accountable for changing my patterns which may not serve me any longer.</p>
<p><b>I'm asking for help from YOU to self-publish this book.</b></p>

(The Shit I've Done For Money) WHAT:
Are You There Craigslist? It's Me, Pearl"" is a book of Craigslist emails that reveal my search for work to survive as an artist in San Francisco. This intimate compilation of emails is ridiculous, mundane, comical, desperate, repetitive, sad, and vulnerable. It is a book for your coffee table, bedside table, toilet-side table, and beach towel for that easy to read poolside book. With the influence of the popular Found books, and the honesty of Amy Shumer, these email exchanges highlight my search for work on Craigslist. From my attempt to get hired as a cupcake decorator, to my success at getting my ass painted as a Rutabaga, to my rejection of a creepy man looking for a blues dancing partner, this book lets you see all the crazy bullshit I thought about, attempted, and succeeded in, while hustling to SURVIVE. 
SO?
So, my next step in this process--I need your help to get this manuscript turned into a book, complete with selected pictures I sent accompanying some of these emails! 
WHO ARE YOU?? Why is this exciting?
My name is Pearl Marill and I'm a San Francisco based choreographer, actress, and writer. I've been living in the Bay Area for a decade. In these 10 years, I've been performing, producing, directing, and creating original work in the form of live theater, short films, music videos, and sketch comedy.  My passion lies in the fusion of theater improvisation, modern dance, and comedy. Craigslist has always been a rich source of inquiry for me, and I won an Isadora Duncan Dance Award in 2012 for a piece based off the Missed Connections section of Craigslist, called  Missed Connection.
To survive as an artist anywhere is a challenge. To stay eating as an artist or just anyone that isn't involved in Tech in San Francisco is a HUGE challenge. I've compiled my decade long collection of email threads that document my consistent hustle for work and put it into a manuscript. I wanted to publish these emails for a few reasons.
1) I've received the Theater Bay Area and Dancer's Group Ca$h Fund that I'm using to select 5 artists to create new works using text from the manuscript. The dates for that show are SET! These artists will be presenting work at Pianofight in San Francisco on May 27 and 28 and the performances are to hopefully accompany the book release of ""Are You There Craigslist? It's Me, Pearl."" 
2) The catharsis of purging your inbox and sent box to produce a creative project is great. 
3) Like many artists, I fall under the category of being depressed when I'm not engaged in a creative endeavor. This project was a way for me to avoid depression, and make lemonade from lemons. 
4) Survival mode is real. It's funny to be a voyeur and be privvy to all the crazy shit people do for money. 
5) This is a path to broadening my channels and realizing the great world that exists outside of Craigslist. To create this book helps to hold myself accountable for changing my patterns which may not serve me any longer.
I'm asking for help from YOU to self-publish this book.
I'm excited about this project for many reasons!
1) Like I mentioned above, I've already received a grant for this project, to give to other artists to create new work. Now I'm asking for help in the publishing portion of the project. I'm halfway there!
2) Getting to compile these emails into a book has been eye-opening.  The sometimes desperate, occasionally funny, often repetitive, and frequently honest exchanges show how I/we continually shape-shift ourselves to fit into the molds we so desire.

By helping me, you will help me publish my FIRST BOOK! You can read it with coffee, while you are on the toilet, or when you are depressed and need a good laugh or dose of perspective.    What I need & What You Get I'm asking for $1,999 because that is EXACTLY how much it costs for the black and white Debut package on Lulu's Self-Publishing packaging bundle. With this bundle, I will get one-on-one help with marketing, promotional materials, editing, book design and layout, and more. Because time is of the essence for me, it's really important that I have a solid product by the end of May, to accompany the ""Are You There Craigslist? It's Me, Pearl"" show.  
BREAKDOWN:  I am asking for exactly how much I need to pay for the specific Black and White Debut Package which is $1,999.  Any money received over this amount will go towards compensating the selected artists more money and covering marketing expenses to advertise the shows at Pianofight. If I don't reach my desired goal, all the acquired funds will still go towards this publishing fee, I will fundraise in different venues and platforms to make up the difference.    The Impact

This book addresses the age-old cliche “Follow Your Passion” and replaces it with the fact that we should instead “Experience Passion.”<br/><br/>My name is Steven Mezzacappa and I am the author of <i>Passion With Purpose: The Fire Within</i>. I wrote this book because there are over 60,000 search results on Amazon for purpose, yet we still find ourselves searching for truth, significance, and ways to make social and societal impacts. After wrestling through a battle with severe depression during my final year of college and as I began my career, I uncovered a deeper relationship with God and in that relationship, my eyes were opened to God’s divine blueprints for building a life of fulfillment, destiny, and impact. This book is about these blueprints.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover you do not need anything else other than a healthy relationship with God and others in order to build a life of fulfillment, destiny, and impact. It’s my hope that, in reading this book, society’s definition of success for you fades into the distance as you for yourself uncover the blueprints to building a life that is enjoyable, meaningful, and impactful. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for “passion” itself and hope that after reading this book, you’ll never look at the word passion again. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you build passion in every season of your life whether it be a season of joy or a season of adversity.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll uncover a new perspective about passion and its relationship to living out a life that is fulfilling, significant, and impactful. You'll hear stories such as:</p><ul>
<li>How embracing suffering can lead to fulfillment, destiny, &amp; impact</li>
<li>My journey through depression and into healing</li>
<li>My experiences in Panama throughout college that served as another major inspiration for this book</li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you are passionate about self-improvement, desiring to grow deeper in your faith, and uncovering more ways to make an impact in the lives of others around you.<br/><br/><i>Passion With Purpose: The Fire Within</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to those looking for more passion in life and those who are looking to understand God in a deeper way.</p><p> </p><h2>The Book - <i>Passion With Purpose: The Fire Within</i>
</h2><p><br/><strong>Part 1 - Fulfillment - Living a Life Inspired by the Great Architect</strong><br/>Part 1 inspires us to look at an alternative definition of passion. It defines passion as not something we follow, but something we experience and can build within ourselves. When it comes to having a fulfilling life, it’s now so much about what we have, but truly it is about who we have and understanding what is building up or tearing down the passion within our hearts, in spite of any season we find ourselves in.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 - Destiny - Living a Life Encouraged by the Great Physician</strong><br/>Part 2 encourages us to learn how our passion can be driven by fear or lead by love. Throughout our lives, we will be dealt emotional wounds and if left unhealed can serve as the engine for the actions and dreams we set up for our lives. By being lead into love by the Great Physician, it is a passion that is fostered and cultivated by Jesus that not only sustains our passion, but also leads us into the destiny for our lives.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 - Impact - Living a Life Empowered by the Great Life Coach</strong><br/>Part 3 empowers us to make a difference in the lives of others around us by learning how to be lead and guided by the Great Life Coach, the Holy Spirit. We are equipped with the tools to not only build the fire up within ourselves, but also build up the fire and passion within those around us so that in spite of any adversity or challenge, we and others around us can walk out the callings and purpose on our lives with a passion that never burns out.</p><p> </p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

</ul><p> </p><h2>About the Author</h2><p>Graduating from The Pennsylvania State University in 2017 with a B.A.E. in Architectural Engineering, Steven Mezzacappa is a Business Development Engineer for Turner Construction Company, one of the country’s largest commercial construction management firms. Before joining the workforce, Steven was recognized as the New Face of Civil Engineering in the United States in 2016. Having a passion to build buildings since he was a child, Steven has grown to develop a passion for people and is on a personal mission to inspire, encourage, and empower others around him. This book is one of the first steps in making this mission a reality.<br/><br/>After living out a lifelong dream the summer before his final year of college, Steven found himself battling depression when his lifelong dream was met with an unexpected dose of reality and with that disappointment. Continuing into his final year of college, despite being on Penn State’s Homecoming Court, experiencing first hand PSU Football’s B10 Championship win, and being surrounded by some of PSU’s top Student Leaders, Steven found himself in a daily battle with depression struggling to find hope and a future for himself. It was in this journey that Steven returned back to his Christian roots and in this encounter uncovered a deeper, more significant relationship with God that not only put him on a path to heal from depression, but also uncover a new vision for his life.<br/><br/>This book brings forward some of the most significant lessons from Steven’s experience and sheds light on a new way to look at passion and your relationship with God. Steven firmly believes that we all have inherent worth, value, and a call to love others and make a profound difference in our social circles and world; but in order to build a life like this we so desperately seek to live, it is important that we humble ourselves and continually be inspired by the Great Architect, encouraged by the Great Physician, and empowered by the Holy Spirit.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Steven Mezzacappa at steven@passionwithpurpose.life and on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, &amp; YouTube: @StevenMezzacappa<br/><br/>#PassionWithPurpose</p><p> </p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish.

When it comes to having a fulfilling life, it’s now so much about what we have, but truly it is about who we have and understanding what is building up or tearing down the passion within our hearts, in spite of any season we find ourselves in.Part 2 - Destiny - Living a Life Encouraged by the Great PhysicianPart 2 encourages us to learn how our passion can be driven by fear or lead by love. Throughout our lives, we will be dealt emotional wounds and if left unhealed can serve as the engine for the actions and dreams we set up for our lives. By being lead into love by the Great Physician, it is a passion that is fostered and cultivated by Jesus that not only sustains our passion, but also leads us into the destiny for our lives.Part 3 - Impact - Living a Life Empowered by the Great Life CoachPart 3 empowers us to make a difference in the lives of others around us by learning how to be lead and guided by the Great Life Coach, the Holy Spirit. We are equipped with the tools to not only build the fire up within ourselves, but also build up the fire and passion within those around us so that in spite of any adversity or challenge, we and others around us can walk out the callings and purpose on our lives with a passion that never burns out. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

 About the AuthorGraduating from The Pennsylvania State University in 2017 with a B.A.E. in Architectural Engineering, Steven Mezzacappa is a Business Development Engineer for Turner Construction Company, one of the country’s largest commercial construction management firms. Before joining the workforce, Steven was recognized as the New Face of Civil Engineering in the United States in 2016. Having a passion to build buildings since he was a child, Steven has grown to develop a passion for people and is on a personal mission to inspire, encourage, and empower others around him. This book is one of the first steps in making this mission a reality.After living out a lifelong dream the summer before his final year of college, Steven found himself battling depression when his lifelong dream was met with an unexpected dose of reality and with that disappointment. Continuing into his final year of college, despite being on Penn State’s Homecoming Court, experiencing first hand PSU Football’s B10 Championship win, and being surrounded by some of PSU’s top Student Leaders, Steven found himself in a daily battle with depression struggling to find hope and a future for himself. It was in this journey that Steven returned back to his Christian roots and in this encounter uncovered a deeper, more significant relationship with God that not only put him on a path to heal from depression, but also uncover a new vision for his life.This book brings forward some of the most significant lessons from Steven’s experience and sheds light on a new way to look at passion and your relationship with God. Steven firmly believes that we all have inherent worth, value, and a call to love others and make a profound difference in our social circles and world; but in order to build a life like this we so desperately seek to live, it is important that we humble ourselves and continually be inspired by the Great Architect, encouraged by the Great Physician, and empowered by the Holy Spirit.For more information, you can connect with Steven Mezzacappa at steven@passionwithpurpose.life and on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, & YouTube: @StevenMezzacappa#PassionWithPurpose Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

<p>It's been just over a year since the release of the ebook version of ""Downriver: A Tale of Moving Pictures Before Hollywood.""  The reviews are in: </p>
<p>“Downriver is compelling, entertaining reading, and for anyone with an interest in the history of film, particularly women in film, it’s essential...”</p>
<p>“Downriver” is an historical novel, but its themes speak very much to today... From fake news stories... to crowds rioting for contact with celebrities, the novel is rife with events echoing our present times.” and “The story serves as a resonant counterpoint to today’s #MeToo movement.”  – Amazon Kindle reviews</p>
<p>I've also been asked, “Is there a printed book? When it is it coming out?” A few reviewers said they'd be happy to review it – once it was in print. They looked forward to reading it, but didn't have a Kindle or other ebook reader, and didn't want to fuss with the technology. Just give me a good old-fashioned book, please!</p>
<p>I got the message. Now it makes sense, given a year's trial, to satisfy not only those readers and reviewers, but myself, the author, as well. I've looked into other publication options, but the signs keep returning to the place I started from, which is to self publish.</p>
<p>But even a self-published book can't manifest overnight. There's a new cover, formatting and many other new angles to figure out.  That's why I'm requesting your help. For a minimum $25 donation, you'll receive an autographed first edition print copy of “Downriver: A Tale of Moving Pictures Before Hollywood.”</p>
<p>There is a renewed interest in the role of women in early moving pictures, as seen by the high visibility of the nonfiction book and accompanying documentary “Without Lying Down” by Carrie Beauchamp and books and documentaries on the first renowned female director, Alice Guy Blache, who plays a prominent part in “Downriver.” There's even a recent children's book about her, “Lights! Camera! Alice!” by Mara Rockliff. On the current scene, there is the close attention paid to female directors Kathryn Bigelow (“The Hurt Locker,”) Greta Gerwig (“Ladybird”) and, of course, the scandals surrounding Harvey Weinstein and other male power brokers in the industry.</p>
<p>The origins of all these forces are there in “Downriver,” as it is mainly about the origins of American film itself.</p>

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>Isolated in a Globalized World: Lessons from a 60,000 Year-Old Tribe is a book at the intersection of anthropological study and human geography.<br/><br/>My name is Dax Emerson, and I am the Author of Isolated in a Globalized World: Lessons from a 60,000 year-old tribe. I wrote this book because I wanted to take a deeper look at the future of isolation, using the Sentinelese people as an anthropological case study.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that groups such as the Sentinelese can help remind us how we value privacy, interconnectedness, and interpersonal connections. Differences in how we value these intangible traits will promote critical analysis into how we view other cultures, as well as how we view “helping” other people. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for anthropology, in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you come to your own conclusions about what the future of isolation should look like, if that isolation should be present at all. I allow readers like you the opportunity to develop your personal opinions, in lieu of “telling” readers what to believe.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the Sentinelese people, the role they play, how they articulate and why extremely isolated tribal groups subsist into the 21st Century:<p>How geography and culture intersect to create an environment where isolation from the outside world is expected.</p>
<p>Why we should remain cautious and thoughtful in wanting to help people groups who are isolated, even if our intentions are well-placed</p>
<p>Insights on the future of isolation from anthropologists, journalists, and academics.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you’re an individual who’s eager to learn more about the intersections of human geography, anthropology, culture, and the human condition. One does not need to be an “expert” or have prior expertise in anthropology to enjoy this book.<br/><br/>Isolated in a Globalized World: Lessons from a 60,000 Year-Old Tribe is a non-fiction book that speaks to young adults and academic professional who are looking at the Sentinelese and isolated tribal groups for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Book</strong> - <i>Isolated in a Globalized World: Lessons from a 60,000 Year-Old Tribe</i></p>
<p>The book is written in 4 Parts:<br/><br/>Part 1 Contains the Introduction + Chapters 1-4. Here, the reader begins with an introduction to the author’s interest in anthropology. The idea of an “isolated people group,” is explored, as well as how such groups continue to survive in a landscape often described as “increasingly interconnected.”<br/><br/>Part 2 Contains Chapters 5-7 In this section, we discover the history of how the Sentinelese have been studied and observed. Here, the “Sentinelese” are described as a people group living on North Sentinel Island, located in the Andaman and Nicobar Island chain. This territory, though geographically closer to Myanmar, is administered by India. These insights include moments from Anthropologists who’ve visited North Sentinel Island, and encompass a greater sphere than traditional media coverage on the Sentinelese. We look at the lives of Dr. Triloknath Pandit &amp; Dr. Madhumala Chattopadhyay.<br/><br/>Part 3 Contains Chapters 8-10, which highlight the ideological debate surrounding the Sentinelese and isolated tribal groups more broadly. In the year 2019; two competing points of view in regards to the Sentinelese are prevalent: One, that they are a human zoo whom should be assimilated into society at-large, or adversely, that they should be free to continue on with their traditional ways despite common societal expectations These opinions are diametrically opposed, and represent two distinct ways in which people outside of isolated tribal groups think about those within. We look at influencers such as blogger Matt Walsh, as well as Ed Liebow, Executive Director of the American Anthropological Association.<br/><br/>Part 4 Contains Chapters 11-12. Chapter 12: The concluding Chapter- Here, I use a friend’s anthropological research story to describe why I remain cautiously optimistic about anthropology’s future in solving problems related to isolation. We join Angela Benson, a fellow undergraduate researcher at the University of Rochester.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In 2011, while driving home one evening, the traffic slowed and my attention was drawn to a crumbling house by the side of the road. The paint was the colour of the sea and there were peeled patches exposing the Bermuda stone beneath. The louvered window was filthy but the glow of a lamp from within revealed just enough to ignite my curiosity. Framing the rows of glass was a luxurious brocade curtain that looked more like it belonged in a Venetian palazzo than an old Bermuda cottage.</span></p>

Then, once the project was underway, I realised that a book would be a wonderful complement to the exhibition and a more complete and permanent way to share the stories.

Then, once the project was underway, I realised that a book would be a wonderful complement to the exhibition and a more complete and permanent way to share the stories. And so began my Tapestry of Tales.
   ~    ~    ~ 

I am a story-teller and for the last twenty-four years, as a fine art photographer, I have captured images of people and places around the world, not just to document them, but to evoke an emotional response. 
A few years ago I read a book in which the protagonist said that he believed that words are inherently more interesting than pictures. As an image-maker, I am not sure I agree. I believe that there is a symbiotic relationship between the two that creates a clearer and more potent message. As such, my goal with this project has been to pair powerful imagery with ardent text.
Originally I just planned to knock on the doors that called to me and hope that I would be invited in. But, after deciding to publish a book as well as having an exhibition, I felt that the inclusion of a selection of curated portraits would weave a more interesting tapestry. They say that you should write what you know, so sprinkled throughout are portraits of people I know - a few by accident and some by design.
This has been one of the most enriching experiences of my life. The extraordinary people I encountered have moved me in a way I had never expected and I will forever be grateful for their kindness. I was nervous about appearing on doorsteps uninvited, but people were receptive and gracious and surprisingly open about their lives. They not only gave me their time, sometimes they gave me their hearts. 

THE THREAD
I was asked why I had chosen the heart for the book cover and realised that at the time it had been purely because I was fond of this particular image. As my journey progressed, however, the heart became the perfect symbol for the project as it became clear that this book was not really about people's homes. While spending time with people, regardless of age, nationality, family dynamic or socio-economic status, I found that the common thread was love. Everyone was nostalgic, treasures their memories and their family history. Often, their most cherished objects were not valuable, they were sentimental. Home really is where the heart is.

I do hope you'd like to contribute and have your own copy of Tapestry of Tales.I understand that you may not be able to contribute funding, but if you would like to help in another way, I'd be over the moon if you could share this page with anyone you think might be interested. facebook | instagramamandatemple.com",5.0,0,"1 Campaign
