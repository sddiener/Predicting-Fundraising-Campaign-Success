My name is Nancy (Qwynne) Lackey, and I am a graduate student at the University of Nebraska working on my Masters in Natural Resource Science with a specialization in Human Dimensions. I am currently campaigning for my research trip this summer to study ecotourism guide training in Southern Africa.  During this trip, I will be able to collect the data necessary to complete my Masters degree. Moreover,  this research trip will allow me to make a valuable contribution to natural resource conservation and community development initiatives, both of which I am extremely passionate about. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>As a contributor you make will help fund the necessary medical and room and board requirements, such as vaccinations and program fees, to stay in the remote guide training camps. In total, those expenses add up to around $3,465 (USD), which is a difficult amount of money for a graduate student to come up with.</p>If I am fortunate enough to raise more than my $2,000 goal, the extra money will still be used to fund a larger portion of my program and medical fees. So, please do not be afraid to help me exceed my fundraising goal!<br/><br/>
<p>A small portion of your contribution (15% or less) will go towards perks for contributors. These perks will include hand written thank you letters, postcards from South Africa, photos from my trip (I am expecting to see a wide variety of African wildlife during my stay in the camps), real Belgium chocolate, and other surprise perks. This will be my way of thanking you for helping me complete a research project that is meaningful. It is also a way for me to  share my experiences with you so that you so that you will hopefully be able to understand why I am so passionate about what I have chosen to do with my studies and my career. <br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This research trip will have a positive impact on ecotourism research and development as well as on myself as an individual. Ever since I was a child watching National Geographic documentaries in my high chair, I have been in love with wildlife and conservation. I have always known that I would spend my life pursuing a career in that field. Upon graduation, I earned a Bachelors degree in biology from Saginaw Valley State University. While doing so, I was fortunate enough to complete an internship and perform my Honors thesis research at a great white shark ecotourism operation in Gansbaai, South Africa, and I quickly became fascinated with ecotourism. <br/></p>
<p>Ecotourism is a environmentally and culturally responsible sub-sector of the tourism industry which strives to  contribute to conservation and community development initiatives.  Though my research and my first-hand experiences, I have learned that ecotourism has incredible potential to transform the attitudes and behaviors of ecotourists, conservation projects, and communities  for the better. <br/></p>
<p>However, there is significant room for ecotourism improvement and development worldwide. Previous research suggests that ecotour guides play an important role within ecotourism operations, but little research has been done on how a guide's training influences this role. </p>
<p>I have developed a  research project that will increase our understanding of ecotour guide training. My chosen research site is an established guide training program based in South Africa, and I will travel there this summer to collect my data. Through interviews, surveys, and observations of both trainers and trainees, I will develop a deeper understanding of how training impacts guides' abilities. </p>
<p>This research will be beneficial on many levels. First, it will make a valuable contribution to ecotourism literature in an area that is poorly populated. Second, the conclusions I draw can be used to improve existing and develop new guide training programs abroad and in the United States. In many areas in the US, Ecotourism has great potential yet is faced with many barriers. My research will be used to begin the conversation about helping ecotourism operations overcome some of those barriers through guide training. I am already pursuing opportunities to use my research in this fashion in the Nebraska. Third, this research will help me professionally and personally, allowing me to earn a Masters degree, gain experience that will make me a competitive candidate for PhD and career opportunities, and make a positive contribution to my lifelong passion. <br/></p>
<ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> At this point, my main risk and challenge is funding. I have already arranged travel and stay with the guide training organization that has graciously agreed to work with me, and my research proposal has already been approved by my Masters thesis committee. However, for past research trips (including my previous one in South Africa) I have always overcome the funding obstacle through scholarships, grants, personal savings,  and if need be, student loans. Hopefully, with your help, I will not have to depend on savings and loans.<br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you do not have the means to contribute to my campaign financially, that's okay! You can still help me by sharing the link to my campaign with your friends, family, and coworkers, through email, Facebook, etc. This will also help me spread the word about ecotourism, guide training, and the positive impacts research such as mine can have. <br/>

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>We are wildlife biologists who saw a massive disconnect in the way we could reach out for real-time global support for critical needs outside our project's budget. We also knew projects all over the world were facing similar issues. Additionally, supporters of projects also want more transparency as to where their money is going, what the outcome of their support is, as well as, better ways to stay connected.</p>
<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<p>Did you know that we have lost over half of the world's wildlife in the last few decades? Did you know we are currently in a mass extinction event? Wildlife organizations need our help more than ever but most people don't even know where to begin to help.</p>
<p><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>This is where Key Conservation comes in.</strong></i></p>

<p>1. Donate Money: Funding is critical to wildlife organizations </p>
<p>2. Skilled Impact: Supporters can help with their professional skills, something that might cost wildlife organizations thousands of dollars to do a professional could do for free. </p>
<p>3. In-Person: Wildlife organizations can reach out to local supporters about real-time volunteer opportunities in their area through push notifications. This feature would update as you travel so you'll never miss an opportunity to help no matter where you are! </p>
<p><strong>Feedback &amp; Updates</strong></p>
<p>The best part is once a wildlife organization puts a supporter's donation or support to use they will send an update showing how it helped them. For example, the idea for Key Conservation came about when we got a call about a nest being washed out to sea. We ran out to our patrol vehicle and realized that we were about to be out of gas. Unfortunately our project was also out of money as well so we ended up using the stipend we got to buy our own food to buy gas. The whole way down to the nest all we could think about was how we knew at least 5 people that would of given us $20 to help save baby sea turtles. If Key Conservation existed then we would of taken a video of these baby sea turtles heading back out to sea so the supporter who helped make this possible could see exactly how they helped. </p>

<p>We could be the generation that stops wildlife extinction in it's tracks if we work together. We still believe we can turn everything around and it's from that sheer determination that Key Conservation was born. <strong><i>Join us in the fight to #endendlings!</i></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>How much funding do you need and where is it going?</h3>
<p>To build both iOS and Android versions of the app with all of the really cool features we would need to raise $105,000. To make attainable goals we have broken the app into 3 versions. Version 1 is the very minimum that we would need to get started and to goes up from there with more funding that we raise. We would love to be able to build both iOS and Android apps so we can reach as many people as possible.</p>
<p>The 3 different versions and their features are described in detail below:</p>

<h3>What's the story on your perks?</h3>
<p>We really wanted to bring you all perks that we would want ourselves.  We teamed up with independent artists and photographers who have a special connection to wildlife to bring you a selection of goodies! Be sure to keep checking back in as we might have a few more perks later in the campaign!</p>
<ul>
<li>Grab a Key Conservation sticker to slap on that refillable water bottle you've been rocking. </li>
<li>t-shirts so you can rock your support!</li>
<li>A unique Key Conservation X Pangolin pin would look dashing on any outfit.</li>
<li>Be sure to grab wildlife photos from Erik Nelson as they are limited edition and only one is available of each!</li>
<li>The Vaquita print highlights the estimated 30 individuals that left in the wild and would be an inspiration to have in your home to never give up the good fight to stop extinction! </li>
</ul>
<h3>
<br/>Where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal?</h3>
<p>We would use the funds that we raise to start working on the development of Version 1 of the app while we try and raise the additional funds to complete it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We still believe, like many other people other there, that we still have time to turn the tide on wildlife extinction - but we must take a stand now. The Key Conservation app has the potential to connect supporters all over the world with wildlife conservation organizations in desperate need of funding and support. Imagine being apart of the force for good that helped make this happen! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We will be building something that we hope will work just as well in the field as it will from the comfort of your couch! We will be enlisting pilot projects and beta testers to make sure that everything runs smoothly when we go LIVE but there will most likely be unforeseen issues that we will have to tackle. We have a development team ready to start when we get funding who have extensive experience building apps and tackling complicated issues. </p>
<p>At the beginning when we first get started the scrolling LIVE Feed will most likely be not as active as we would like but the hope is as more wildlife organizations are brought on it will become a very active feed with a lot of new posts and updates.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can not contribute to our campaign at this time that doesn't mean you can't help!</p>
<p>We need help spreading the word about our campaign and what we are trying to do to stop wildlife extinction! Please consider sharing the campaign with your friends and family and be sure to follow us on social media!</p>

We could be the generation that stops wildlife extinction in it's tracks if we work together. We still believe we can turn everything around and it's from that sheer determination that Key Conservation was born. Join us in the fight to #endendlings!

How much funding do you need and where is it going?
To build both iOS and Android versions of the app with all of the really cool features we would need to raise $105,000. To make attainable goals we have broken the app into 3 versions. Version 1 is the very minimum that we would need to get started and to goes up from there with more funding that we raise. We would love to be able to build both iOS and Android apps so we can reach as many people as possible.
The 3 different versions and their features are described in detail below:

What's the story on your perks?
We really wanted to bring you all perks that we would want ourselves.  We teamed up with independent artists and photographers who have a special connection to wildlife to bring you a selection of goodies! Be sure to keep checking back in as we might have a few more perks later in the campaign!

Grab a Key Conservation sticker to slap on that refillable water bottle you've been rocking. 
t-shirts so you can rock your support!
A unique Key Conservation X Pangolin pin would look dashing on any outfit.
Be sure to grab wildlife photos from Erik Nelson as they are limited edition and only one is available of each!
The Vaquita print highlights the estimated 30 individuals that left in the wild and would be an inspiration to have in your home to never give up the good fight to stop extinction! 


Where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal?
We would use the funds that we raise to start working on the development of Version 1 of the app while we try and raise the additional funds to complete it.

The Impact
We still believe, like many other people other there, that we still have time to turn the tide on wildlife extinction - but we must take a stand now. The Key Conservation app has the potential to connect supporters all over the world with wildlife conservation organizations in desperate need of funding and support. Imagine being apart of the force for good that helped make this happen! 

Risks & Challenges
We will be building something that we hope will work just as well in the field as it will from the comfort of your couch! We will be enlisting pilot projects and beta testers to make sure that everything runs smoothly when we go LIVE but there will most likely be unforeseen issues that we will have to tackle. We have a development team ready to start when we get funding who have extensive experience building apps and tackling complicated issues. 
At the beginning when we first get started the scrolling LIVE Feed will most likely be not as active as we would like but the hope is as more wildlife organizations are brought on it will become a very active feed with a lot of new posts and updates.  

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can not contribute to our campaign at this time that doesn't mean you can't help!
We need help spreading the word about our campaign and what we are trying to do to stop wildlife extinction! Please consider sharing the campaign with your friends and family and be sure to follow us on social media!

<p>Established in 1981, the Environmental Foundation (Guarantee) Limited (EFL) is a non-profit public interest law group, whose mission is to conserve and enhance Sri Lanka’s natural environment. Over the past decade up to date, EFL has been fighting the fight to protect the Wilpattu National Park (WNP).</p>
<p>We are currently tackling 03 major cases within the park (elaborated below) and are in need of your support to continue our work.</p>
<p>The WNP is the oldest and largest National Park on the island. It was declared as a National Park in 1938 under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of Sri Lanka. The adjoining Forest Reserves and Sanctuaries, containing a diverse range of habitats including forests, coastal, marine and wetlands, form a flourishing ecosystem supporting a number of fauna and flora.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533265478/tqzjbhkzfvem5nduwxbt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A total of 284 faunal species belonging to 101 families have been recorded within the WNP, with 21 endemic and 30 nationally threatened species among them. The elephant (<i>Elephas maximus</i>), sloth bear (<i>Melursus ursinus</i>), and leopard (<i>Panthera pardus kotiya</i>) are some of the threatened mammals found in this protected area.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533265625/eqfhhitzon0pdccwaeyf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>In 2013, Wilpattu was also declared as a Ramsar Wetland Cluster, which encompasses the entire park (Willu-pattu meaning 'Land of Lakes'). Some 205 water bodies, both natural and manmade, have been identified within the boundary of the park.</p>

<p>Located 30km west of Anuradhapura, the boundaries of the park lie in the administrative divisions of Puttalam, Anuradhapura and Mannar and spans across the North Central and North Western Provinces of the island.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533265990/zdtrjeqlkh0odapvwqew.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, at present, these priceless natural resources are facing severe threats, a result of multiple anthropogenic activities. Since EFL’s first case on WNP was taken up in 2010, we have been investigating several issues relating to the WNP ranging from deforestation, encroachment to illegal projects within the park.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our Cases</h3>
<p><strong>Illegally constructed road though the Wilpattu National Park </strong></p>
<p>During the period of the civil war, when the WNP was under the control of security forces, the Sri Lankan Navy commenced the construction of two large roads running through the park to facilitate access to the North of the island. Following the end of the war, this road was illegally opened to the public as the ‘Puttalam- Mannar road’, in January 2010, completely violating the provisions of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Challenging this illegally constructed road, which runs through a National Park, EFL instituted a case under a Fundamental Rights Application in March 2010 before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533266077/snfm75egxe3zkj1kvkjn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><u>Risks &amp; Concerns</u></p>
<p>Considering that fact that there is an existing road reaching the same destination, this road through the park has been made accessible merely for convenience, disregarding the major environmental impacts it has on the park’s rich biodiversity. As there are nearby villages, temporary ‘bus stops’ have been established along the road as well.</p>
<p>With the hustle and bustle of buses racing through the park and travelers getting off vehicles, the serenity of the park has been completely lost. It is rather disheartening that this has now become the norm, knowing that wildlife such as deer &amp; elephants cross this road and quite commonly encounter such vehicles. This has not only increased the incidents of road kills but also poses significant danger to travelers too. The allowance of such prohibited activities only trivializes the National Park.</p>
<p>The road undoubtedly poses significant threats disrupting the natural environs, some of which include,</p>
<ul>
<li>Habitat fragmentation and disturbance to the wildlife. Habitat fragmentation has been identified as a major threat affecting the survival of species of wildlife.</li>
<li>Gives rise to human-wildlife conflicts, a major issue experienced in other parts of the country.</li>
<li>Facilitates illegal activities within the park such as sand-mining, poaching and bio-piracy.</li>
<li>Necessitates annual sand-mining to fill up and repair the road after each rainy season.</li>
<li>Unmeasurable damage to the natural ecosystem of Wilpattu resulting from the blocking of the largest floodplain within the park, as well as air and sound pollution caused by constant motor traffic.</li>
<li>Traffic inevitably increases the risk of road kills of wild animals.</li>
<li>Paves the way for other ancillary issues such as encroachment.</li>
<li>Introduction of invasive alien species that can affect all types of ecosystems and lead to irretrievable loss of native species and ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533266374/q4hssqp9zru4gcybvnhf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><u>Status of the Case</u></p>
<p>During the course of this case there were several discussions and site inspections made to reach a settlement agreeable to all parties.</p>
<p>In 2013, the Supreme Court issued an interim order directing authorities to maintain the status quo of the road, where no further development activities would take place especially with regard to the tarring of the road. We were successful in preventing the road from being further developed into a highway.</p>
<p>The case is to be argued on the 8<sup>th</sup> of January 2019 before the Honorable Judges of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Through the case we seek to regulate the vehicles that use the road according to procedures applicable to the entry of visitors to any National Park.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Pallekandhal Church, a jungle shrine located within the WNP </strong></p>
<p>Built centuries ago, the Pallekandhal Church lies within the boundaries of the WNP. Over the years, it has been recognized as a catholic place of worship, with a small shrine placed in an area less than quarter of an acre. As far as tradition goes, an annual feast is held at the church with the attendance of nearby communities.</p>
<p>During the civil war, the church operated in minute scale. Devotees visited only for the feast and stayed overnight in temporary shelters next to the chapel until festivities concluded.  So, the chapel remained abandoned for most part of the year.</p>
<p>Once the WNP reopened post war, there has been a considerable increase in church activities and the annual festival has developed into a grand scale event, drawing more human intrusion in large numbers without proper regulation or control.  What used to be a jungle shrine has now been extensively expanded into a well-constructed church. A significant amount of forest cover has been cleared to expand the church premises while unauthorized road access to the National Park has also advanced over time.</p>
<p>After conducting an extensive investigation, EFL inquired into the irregularities and illegalities surrounding the Church festivities from relevant state departments but the responses received were unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>The forest clearings and unregulated illegal development activities inside the park have been taking place in stages over the last few years. All authorities responsible to prevent such issues have failed to carry out their duties to stop/regulate such unauthorized activities.</p>
<p>Due to the blatant violations made by the Church and the lack of action being taken by relevant officials to prevent such developments, EFL filed a Writ Application in the Court of Appeal on the 24th of January 2018.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533267237/rhuylwhwwuc1xxiekrpi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><u>Risks &amp; Concerns</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Clearing of forest area for camp sites and food stalls resulting in habitat fragmentation.</li>
<li>Absence of adequate waste disposal systems causing land-based and water pollution.</li>
<li>Noise pollution due to the influx of visitors, vehicles and festival activities.</li>
<li>Disturbances to animal behaviour patterns, including foraging, nesting and breeding patterns.</li>
<li>Increases the risk of human-wildlife conflict.</li>
<li>Facilitates illegal activities within the park; encroachment, poaching etc.</li>

<p><u>Status of the Case</u></p>
<p>The instigation of the case gave prominence to this issue, which in turn exerted pressure on authorities to take measures to curtail this year’s festivities of the church.</p>
<p>Through the case we seek to achieve the following,</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevention of the intrusion of large crowds entering the park for the festivities of the church without any supervision and control by the Department of Wildlife Conservation.</li>
<li>Take legal action against those clearing the forest, erecting structures, buildings and other development activities.</li>
<li>A system with modern technology and a comprehensive database to effectively and transparently deal with demarcating the boundaries of National Parks and other Nature Reserves in order to eliminate any ambiguity of land tenement of areas declared so. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pukkulam Village bordering the WNP </strong></p>
<p>Pukkulam is a seasonal fishing village located close to the Northern and Western boundaries of the WNP, and in 1973, was declared as part of the National Park. Considering the existent communities occupying this area, several lands were excluded to accommodate three seasonal fishing villages, namely Pukkulam, Vellamundalam and Pallugahathurai. As these villages lie adjacent to the boundary of the park, the agreement is such that the villages can only be occupied during the fishing seasons (November to April) under strict guidelines and restrictions. All three villages were only accessible from the seaside.</p>
<p>During the civil war, fishing activities were minimal as many fishermen were not permitted to enter the area due to security reasons. When the war ended, the villages at Pallugahathurai and Vellamundalam remained the same, with temporary seasonal settlements.</p>
<p>The fishermen from Pukkulam however, returned with their families and settled in Pukkulam permanently. At present there are approximately 153 fishing families with 450 individuals engaging in fishing activities.</p>
<p>When notified of this issue, EFL made inquiries from relevant authorities and conducted several site visits to address the matter. Through discussions with community members, our team discovered that the villagers residing in Pukkulam are all kin of the settlers who left during the war. Villagers use the bus service, which travels through the illegal “Puttalam – Mannar road”, to reach the Pukkulam village.</p>
<p>Community members also shared concerns with regard to the loss of land, a result of sea erosion. This was visible during the site visits made by our team as well. Because of this, villagers have been forced to encroach into the WNP and currently several families have settled and built permanent houses within the park premises.</p>
<p>This investigation is still ongoing and the findings will determine whether legal action is to follow against relevant government officials. Equally important, the case will seek adequate relief for all affected community members.</p>

<p><u>Current Status</u></p>
<ul>
<li>There are 11 permanent structures including 9 houses, a church and an empty building.</li>
<li>Villagers have also requested for more permanent housing structures to be constructed by relevant authorities.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Risks &amp; Concerns </u></p>
<ul>
<li>A proper environmental assessment, which is vital in such sensitive locations, has not been done prior to relocating families in to the village.</li>
<li>According to the Fauna &amp; Flora Protection Ordinance of Sri Lanka, approval needs to be granted by the Department of Wildlife Conservation to conduct any development activity within one mile of a National Park. In this instance, necessary approvals have not been obtained. This sets a bad precedent, encouraging other government entities/private investors to bypass following proper procedure, considering no action/penalties have been enforced so far.</li>
<li>Increased human activity in the area/within the park, will increase the risk of human wildlife conflict.</li>
<li>Habitat destruction and threat to wildlife in the area.</li>
<li>Facilitates poaching and other illegal activities within the park.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Why should you support this campaign?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The WNP provides a home for a range of endangered species that have made Sri Lanka a global biodiversity hotspot.</li>
<li>Forests provide invaluable ecosystem services to humans including, combating climate change, air purification, flood regulation and groundwater recharge.</li>
<li>The long-term revenue that can be generated by maintaining the pristine nature of the park is significantly higher than the short-term benefits that are gained from the exploitation of the park’s natural resources.</li>
</ul>

In 2013, Wilpattu was also declared as a Ramsar Wetland Cluster, which encompasses the entire park (Willu-pattu meaning 'Land of Lakes'). Some 205 water bodies, both natural and manmade, have been identified within the boundary of the park.

Located 30km west of Anuradhapura, the boundaries of the park lie in the administrative divisions of Puttalam, Anuradhapura and Mannar and spans across the North Central and North Western Provinces of the island.

Unfortunately, at present, these priceless natural resources are facing severe threats, a result of multiple anthropogenic activities. Since EFL’s first case on WNP was taken up in 2010, we have been investigating several issues relating to the WNP ranging from deforestation, encroachment to illegal projects within the park.

 
Our Cases
Illegally constructed road though the Wilpattu National Park 
During the period of the civil war, when the WNP was under the control of security forces, the Sri Lankan Navy commenced the construction of two large roads running through the park to facilitate access to the North of the island. Following the end of the war, this road was illegally opened to the public as the ‘Puttalam- Mannar road’, in January 2010, completely violating the provisions of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of Sri Lanka.
Challenging this illegally constructed road, which runs through a National Park, EFL instituted a case under a Fundamental Rights Application in March 2010 before the Supreme Court.

Risks & Concerns
Considering that fact that there is an existing road reaching the same destination, this road through the park has been made accessible merely for convenience, disregarding the major environmental impacts it has on the park’s rich biodiversity. As there are nearby villages, temporary ‘bus stops’ have been established along the road as well.
With the hustle and bustle of buses racing through the park and travelers getting off vehicles, the serenity of the park has been completely lost. It is rather disheartening that this has now become the norm, knowing that wildlife such as deer & elephants cross this road and quite commonly encounter such vehicles. This has not only increased the incidents of road kills but also poses significant danger to travelers too. The allowance of such prohibited activities only trivializes the National Park.
The road undoubtedly poses significant threats disrupting the natural environs, some of which include,

Habitat fragmentation and disturbance to the wildlife. Habitat fragmentation has been identified as a major threat affecting the survival of species of wildlife.
Gives rise to human-wildlife conflicts, a major issue experienced in other parts of the country.
Facilitates illegal activities within the park such as sand-mining, poaching and bio-piracy.
Necessitates annual sand-mining to fill up and repair the road after each rainy season.
Unmeasurable damage to the natural ecosystem of Wilpattu resulting from the blocking of the largest floodplain within the park, as well as air and sound pollution caused by constant motor traffic.
Traffic inevitably increases the risk of road kills of wild animals.
Paves the way for other ancillary issues such as encroachment.
Introduction of invasive alien species that can affect all types of ecosystems and lead to irretrievable loss of native species and ecosystems.



Status of the Case
During the course of this case there were several discussions and site inspections made to reach a settlement agreeable to all parties.
In 2013, the Supreme Court issued an interim order directing authorities to maintain the status quo of the road, where no further development activities would take place especially with regard to the tarring of the road. We were successful in preventing the road from being further developed into a highway.
The case is to be argued on the 8th of January 2019 before the Honorable Judges of the Supreme Court.
Through the case we seek to regulate the vehicles that use the road according to procedures applicable to the entry of visitors to any National Park.
 
The Pallekandhal Church, a jungle shrine located within the WNP 
Built centuries ago, the Pallekandhal Church lies within the boundaries of the WNP. Over the years, it has been recognized as a catholic place of worship, with a small shrine placed in an area less than quarter of an acre. As far as tradition goes, an annual feast is held at the church with the attendance of nearby communities.
During the civil war, the church operated in minute scale. Devotees visited only for the feast and stayed overnight in temporary shelters next to the chapel until festivities concluded.  So, the chapel remained abandoned for most part of the year.
Once the WNP reopened post war, there has been a considerable increase in church activities and the annual festival has developed into a grand scale event, drawing more human intrusion in large numbers without proper regulation or control.  What used to be a jungle shrine has now been extensively expanded into a well-constructed church. A significant amount of forest cover has been cleared to expand the church premises while unauthorized road access to the National Park has also advanced over time.
After conducting an extensive investigation, EFL inquired into the irregularities and illegalities surrounding the Church festivities from relevant state departments but the responses received were unsatisfactory.
The forest clearings and unregulated illegal development activities inside the park have been taking place in stages over the last few years. All authorities responsible to prevent such issues have failed to carry out their duties to stop/regulate such unauthorized activities.
Due to the blatant violations made by the Church and the lack of action being taken by relevant officials to prevent such developments, EFL filed a Writ Application in the Court of Appeal on the 24th of January 2018.

Risks & Concerns

Clearing of forest area for camp sites and food stalls resulting in habitat fragmentation.
Absence of adequate waste disposal systems causing land-based and water pollution.
Noise pollution due to the influx of visitors, vehicles and festival activities.
Disturbances to animal behaviour patterns, including foraging, nesting and breeding patterns.
Increases the risk of human-wildlife conflict.
Facilitates illegal activities within the park; encroachment, poaching etc.




Status of the Case
The instigation of the case gave prominence to this issue, which in turn exerted pressure on authorities to take measures to curtail this year’s festivities of the church.
Through the case we seek to achieve the following,

Prevention of the intrusion of large crowds entering the park for the festivities of the church without any supervision and control by the Department of Wildlife Conservation.
Take legal action against those clearing the forest, erecting structures, buildings and other development activities.
A system with modern technology and a comprehensive database to effectively and transparently deal with demarcating the boundaries of National Parks and other Nature Reserves in order to eliminate any ambiguity of land tenement of areas declared so. 

 
Pukkulam Village bordering the WNP 
Pukkulam is a seasonal fishing village located close to the Northern and Western boundaries of the WNP, and in 1973, was declared as part of the National Park. Considering the existent communities occupying this area, several lands were excluded to accommodate three seasonal fishing villages, namely Pukkulam, Vellamundalam and Pallugahathurai. As these villages lie adjacent to the boundary of the park, the agreement is such that the villages can only be occupied during the fishing seasons (November to April) under strict guidelines and restrictions. All three villages were only accessible from the seaside.
During the civil war, fishing activities were minimal as many fishermen were not permitted to enter the area due to security reasons. When the war ended, the villages at Pallugahathurai and Vellamundalam remained the same, with temporary seasonal settlements.
The fishermen from Pukkulam however, returned with their families and settled in Pukkulam permanently. At present there are approximately 153 fishing families with 450 individuals engaging in fishing activities.
When notified of this issue, EFL made inquiries from relevant authorities and conducted several site visits to address the matter. Through discussions with community members, our team discovered that the villagers residing in Pukkulam are all kin of the settlers who left during the war. Villagers use the bus service, which travels through the illegal “Puttalam – Mannar road”, to reach the Pukkulam village.
Community members also shared concerns with regard to the loss of land, a result of sea erosion. This was visible during the site visits made by our team as well. Because of this, villagers have been forced to encroach into the WNP and currently several families have settled and built permanent houses within the park premises.
This investigation is still ongoing and the findings will determine whether legal action is to follow against relevant government officials. Equally important, the case will seek adequate relief for all affected community members.

Current Status

There are 11 permanent structures including 9 houses, a church and an empty building.
Villagers have also requested for more permanent housing structures to be constructed by relevant authorities.



Risks & Concerns 

A proper environmental assessment, which is vital in such sensitive locations, has not been done prior to relocating families in to the village.
According to the Fauna & Flora Protection Ordinance of Sri Lanka, approval needs to be granted by the Department of Wildlife Conservation to conduct any development activity within one mile of a National Park. In this instance, necessary approvals have not been obtained. This sets a bad precedent, encouraging other government entities/private investors to bypass following proper procedure, considering no action/penalties have been enforced so far.
Increased human activity in the area/within the park, will increase the risk of human wildlife conflict.
Habitat destruction and threat to wildlife in the area.
Facilitates poaching and other illegal activities within the park.

 

Why should you support this campaign?

The WNP provides a home for a range of endangered species that have made Sri Lanka a global biodiversity hotspot.
Forests provide invaluable ecosystem services to humans including, combating climate change, air purification, flood regulation and groundwater recharge.
The long-term revenue that can be generated by maintaining the pristine nature of the park is significantly higher than the short-term benefits that are gained from the exploitation of the park’s natural resources.

The more poisoned rats it eats, the more poison it bioaccumulates, similar to what is happening to humans.</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I want myself, the team, and the farm to become role models for domestic and international  organizations aiming to reform modern agriculture and ensure a future for humanity. The primary approach for farm operations will be from the research and positive results on regenerative agriculture done by <a href=""http://www.singingfrogsfarm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Singing Frogs Farm</a> in California, <a href=""http://www.polyfacefarms.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Polyface Farms</a> in Virginia, the <a href=""http://rodaleinstitute.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rodale Institute</a> in Pennsylvania, <a href=""http://regenerationinternational.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Regeneration International</a>, and <a href=""http://gerson.org/gerpress/the-gerson-therapy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Gerson Institute.</a></span></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479418835/qufssqons2gdqqt6gtyh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479418894/jme4bwvzhoxj7baso1ig.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><u><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>What we have done:</b></span></u></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I am a steward of this Earth, and have devoted my life in the pursuit of bettering the world in one form or another.

My journey stated five years ago, when my body began rejecting processed foods. Once I cut out fast food, soda, most sugar, and switched to organic food I stopped experiencing the symptoms!  It is my goal to give other people the same opportunities to have access to locally grown, organic food so they can live the best version of their lives. The amount of cancer, food allergies, cognitive, reproductive,  digestive and skin issues in humans  and animals has never in history occurred at the level they are now. Everyone on this Earth has the right to organic food and to live disease and cancer free. Barfoot Acres Sanctuary will be an environment for children, adults, and animals to thrive happily. Why Regenerative Organic Agriculture?According to Regeneration International, an organization at the forefront of saving the world:""The loss of the world’s fertile soil and biodiversity, along with the loss of indigenous seeds and knowledge, pose a mortal threat to our future survival. According to soil scientists, at current rates of soil destruction (i.e. decarbonization, erosion, desertification, chemical pollution), within 50 years we will not only suffer serious damage to public health due to a qualitatively degraded food supply characterized by diminished nutrition and loss of important trace minerals, but we will literally no longer have enough arable topsoil to feed ourselves. Without protecting and regenerating the soil on our four billion acres of cultivated farmland, 14 billion acres of pasture and rangeland, and 10 billion acres of forest land, it will be impossible to feed the world, keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, or halt the loss of biodiversity."" Why we are starting the farm: IMPROVE FARMING:  Improve yields using permaculture- a whole systems approach, Expand to hire employees and provide fair-trade living wages. Improve local economy by keeping money local. Create drought resistant plants and soil by adding compost. FOOD INSECURITY: Improve vitamin and mineral nutritional content of produce. Utilizing every square foot of pastured acreage with fruit orchards, vegetable gardens, culinary and medicinal herbs, and wildflower flower fields means we will be able to contribute an incredible amount of food to society. I also want to work harder to provide organic food to schools, battered women's shelters, and homeless shelters.CARBON LIMIT: Reverse climate change by absorbing carbon pollution from the atmosphere by adding carbon rich compost to the soil. Not using heavy machinery. Supplying locally means not requiring long distance refrigerated transport of our produce. No processing and excessive packaging. We will only use recycled materials for packaging.INCREASE BIODIVERSITY:  Perennial hedgerows provide shelter for beneficial insects. Farming near forested land means a major increase in predator habitat and decrease in pest problems. Bees and other pollinators are the first to be poisoned by pesiticde usage. Heavy pesticide and poison usage in large farms move up the food chain and bio accumulate in predators. For example: a farmer has a rat problem in his 1,000 acres of corn so he/she sets out poison. After the rat is poisoned, it will run away and die, where it will be eaten by a predator. Now the predator has ingested the poison. The more poisoned rats it eats, the more poison it bioaccumulates, similar to what is happening to humans.I want myself, the team, and the farm to become role models for domestic and international  organizations aiming to reform modern agriculture and ensure a future for humanity. The primary approach for farm operations will be from the research and positive results on regenerative agriculture done by Singing Frogs Farm in California, Polyface Farms in Virginia, the Rodale Institute in Pennsylvania, Regeneration International, and The Gerson Institute.   What we have done:I am a steward of this Earth, and have devoted my life in the pursuit of bettering the world in one form or another. Over many years I acquired many different skill sets like construction, plumbing, irrigation, landscape architecture, and learning how to work on a diesel engine that will benefit Barefoot Acres.

Les secteurs à proximité ont été colonisés par le Roseau commun (Phragmites australis), une espèce exotique envahissante particulièrement agressive dans les milieux humides. Afin de contrer son avancée, des techniques ont été développées par le Groupe Phragmites de l'Université Laval et nous entendons les mettre en oeuvre. Une partie des fonds récoltés iront exclusivement à cette fin.

To counter its progress, various techniques have been developed by the Phragmites group of Université Laval and we intend to implement them. Part of the raised funds will be used exclusively to that end.

</p>
<p>Wir sind auf dem Weg zur Weltklimakonferenz in Paris, um dort für den schnellen und konsequenten Umstieg auf erneuerbare Energien zu protestieren. Unser Team hat sich am 3. Oktober in Hamburg auf den Weg gemacht mit der Botschaft: RENEW Climate Sail to Paris #COP21.  Wir fordern den sofortigen Umstieg auf erneuerbare Energien und das Ende der Subventionen für die Ausbeutung fossiler Energiequellen. Diese ca. 400 Millionen Dollar pro Jahr sollen besser in den Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien gesteckt werden. Unsere Politiker müssen dieses Mal erfolgreich sein. Sie dürfen nicht wieder scheitern. Die Welt braucht gemeinsame Klimaziele, und nie sah es dafür so gut aus wie dieses Jahr. Es gilt also Druck zu machen, dass diese Forderungen unser Bürgerwille sind. Das machen wir und nehmen schon jetzt viele 100 Botschaften mit auf unsere Tour.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: justify;"">Planet Earth has limited resources. Fossil Fuels will eventually run out. Nuclear Energy creates 1000's of lbs of toxic waste every year polluting the environment. The people in first world countries have limited financial resources and are feeling the squeeze when it comes to paying for living costs. Then there are people on this planet that still have no access to electricity. All of this needs to change! The Earth is reaching its limit! </b><br/></p>
<p>At E-Ventus Energy we believe we have found the solution. We have designed a device that generates power using air. It collects air as it flows and uses it to create power using a new innovative patented turbine system. We are using indiegogo to raise funds to complete our final prototype and obtain licensing to sell our units all over the world. Please read on and learn about what our goals and visions are and how you can help us achieve them.</p>
<p><b>The LiveAir Turbine</b></p>
<p>LiveAir is 4ft tall, 3ft wide, emits low level noise,  zero emissions, and is mobile which means when you move, it moves!

</div></div>","Planet Earth has limited resources. Fossil Fuels will eventually run out. Nuclear Energy creates 1000's of lbs of toxic waste every year polluting the environment. The people in first world countries have limited financial resources and are feeling the squeeze when it comes to paying for living costs. Then there are people on this planet that still have no access to electricity. All of this needs to change! The Earth is reaching its limit! 
At E-Ventus Energy we believe we have found the solution. We have designed a device that generates power using air. It collects air as it flows and uses it to create power using a new innovative patented turbine system. We are using indiegogo to raise funds to complete our final prototype and obtain licensing to sell our units all over the world. Please read on and learn about what our goals and visions are and how you can help us achieve them.
The LiveAir Turbine
LiveAir is 4ft tall, 3ft wide, emits low level noise,  zero emissions, and is mobile which means when you move, it moves! It can also be transported to different locations in response to catastrophic situations like, wars, flooding, earthquakes etc. The LiveAir Turbine collects air from the roof of your home using small air vents which feed into the turbine that sits indoors or outdoors creating a consistent flow of energy.

Creating an organic farm with a regenerative foundation using biodynamic &amp; permaculture tools. Hotel facilities to receive guests, sharing our love for sustainable and organic food, farm to table gastronomy, olive oil and natural wines. Every step we made was always committed to protecting the environment using technologies such as geothermal heating, natural waste management system, solar water heating, using natural cleaning material, natural bedding material, recycling, zero food waste and composting. But always at the center stage was our holy exchange of ideas, of sharing food, protecting the environment and creating human links with a vision for a future worth being proud leaving to our children.</p>

<h3>WHAT HAPPENED TO CORAL REEFS?</h3>
<p>Since 2016, the hot water in Australia has been leading to massive coral bleaching, killing off approximately half of the Great Barrier Reef - the world’s largest and most extensive reef system. The heat and acidity are heavily damaging and widely spreading throughout the oceans, with devastating effects across the planet. We need to take immediate action to restore the marine ecosystem before it’s too late! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET?</h3>
<ul>
<li>We will need a total of 10,000 USD to prototype 6 x ""reef pod"" designs and after that, we will deploy over 25 individual ‘pods’ throughout 2019.</li>
<li>Donation starts from 10 USD, you will receive a variety of gifts, including a chance to win 3 nights in a Private Pool Villa at the award-winning Song Saa Private Island <a href=""http://www.songsaa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.songsaa.com</a> donated by Song Saa Private Island </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?</h3>
<ul><li><strong>PRESERVING BIODIVERSITY</strong></li></ul>
<p>The global loss of coral reefs threatens to wipe out various ecologically and commercially important species. Artificial reefs can help combat this loss by providing the habitat and feeding grounds that many reef-dependent species need to survive, which will help to preserve an area’s biodiversity.</p>
<ul><li><strong>INCREASING FISH STOCKS</strong></li></ul>
<p>By providing a safe refuge for juvenile fish to settle, artificial reefs can enhance fish populations, which in turn benefits local fishing communities by ensuring an ongoing source of food and income.</p>
<ul><li><strong>PROVIDING HABITAT COMPLEXITY</strong></li></ul>
<p>Various reef creatures rely on good habitat complexity (tunnels, holes, overhangs, caves) to escape predators. Artificial reefs can be designed to increase the habitat complexity of an area that may have been degraded by intense storms or destructive fishing practices, thus providing much-needed habitat for the survival of these reef species.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>HOW DO DONATIONS HELP?</h3>
<p>Creating artificial reefs is not as simple as throwing some wooden, metal or concrete structures in the water. Care needs to be taken to ensure that the design, materials, construction, and placement of the artificial reef does not negatively impact surrounding natural habitats. As such, we are prototyping 6 different 'reef pod’ designs to find the ones that work best in our beloved marine reserve. Having achieved this, we will then deploy 25+ individual ‘pods’ throughout 2019. Donations received will directly support our scientific investigation, in addition to funding the creation and installation of our first 25 reef pods. You will be actively involved in making the coral reefs in our Song Saa Marine Reserve healthier and more biodiverse. </p>

Care needs to be taken to ensure that the design, materials, construction, and placement of the artificial reef does not negatively impact surrounding natural habitats. As such, we are prototyping 6 different 'reef pod’ designs to find the ones that work best in our beloved marine reserve. Having achieved this, we will then deploy 25+ individual ‘pods’ throughout 2019. Donations received will directly support our scientific investigation, in addition to funding the creation and installation of our first 25 reef pods. You will be actively involved in making the coral reefs in our Song Saa Marine Reserve healthier and more biodiverse.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>What is the one thing that connects all of us? Not just all humans, or even all animals, but all living entities. Our Earth is home to nearly 8 billion people and 8.7 millions different species of animals and plants. We are only given one earth. One environment for all creatures, to move, eat, sleep, live. However, in recent years many environments have been stripped away, due to humanity’s own self destruction. </p>
<p>As filmmakers it is our job to highlight and document the stories of those who cannot speak on their own such as those who are being taken from their homes or who have had their homes taken from them. Such is the case of our crew for Feral, and the 150 feral horses facing possible extinction on Cumberland Island. </p>
<p>Cumberland Island is designated as a National seashore and wilderness according to the National Park Services. With this designation comes many benefits yet some disadvantages for other animals. 150 Feral Horses are designated as “wild animals” in the park, leaving them to fend for themselves with out any aid from any organization.</p>
<p>Organizations have proposed ethical means to let the population of horses die out.  This in reference to making the entire population infertile and letting them die out over time.    </p>
<h2><strong>The Conflict</strong></h2>
<p>The horses are too heavy for wetland marshes and have a multitude of other habitats that degrade both themselves and the habitat.  The horses sink into the soft dirt, mud, or sand getting stuck and starving to death.  As well, the horses destroy massive amounts of vegetation in areas they frequent; destroying other habitat for other animals.  Though the most affected animals by Feral Horses are that of Sea Turtles which trample their nests.  Organizations such as Wild Cumberland wish to educate people about the suffering and destructiveness of the Feral Horses on Cumberland Island.  Their stance is to remove the Horses ethically through the use of contraception or vasectomy of the entire horse population.  </p>
<p>The National Park Services and that of Local tourism’s stance is to currently keep the horses on the island as it is a way of supporting an influx of visitors to the Island. Though who has the choice to allow them to die out on their own or become infertile?</p>
<p>An animal is currently struggling in an environment that it is not adapted for. Often getting stuck in and sinking into the Earth; starving to death or being victimized by predators like that of Alligators. The Feral Horses on Cumberland Island are not being maintained by the NPS. An effect of this is that female mare horses tend to procreate at a much younger age than they should. More likely than not, it leads to malnutrition for the horses.   As a result of the non-native species other animals are struggling as well. The biggest case of all is that of Sea Turtles. Having their nests trampled by the large mammal on the sandy beaches.  </p>
<h2><strong>Our Goal</strong></h2>
<p>Our goal is for this documentary to reach domestic markets for television, theatrical, and commercial release.  We would ultimately like this film to stretch and reach potential environmental companies and activists. With their support and distribution, we can further our message on a larger platform. We plan on submitting to film festivals around the United States and environmental-oriented film festivals around the world. From here, we plan to seek distribution from entities that support regenerative agriculture and environmental change. Additionally, we are open to the documentary’s use as an educational tool for schools, colleges, and universities across the United States. </p>
<p>We will be submitting this documentary to film festivals in the short form documentary category. We will be targeting environmental film festivals, Georgia based festivals, and student festivals. Some of the festivals we plan on submitting to include: </p>
<p>Ag &amp; Art Film Festival</p>
<p>American Conservation Film Festival</p>
<p>Atlanta Docufest</p>
<p>Big Sky Documentary Film Festival</p>

<p>North Dakota Environmental Rights Film Festival</p>
<p>SCAD Savannah Film Festival</p>
<p>Wild and Scenic Environmental Film Festival </p>
<h2>In An Ideal World</h2>
<p>This would bring about conversation about what can be done for the feral horses of Cumberland Island and create an emotional connection with our audience.  It would also spark change in how the National Park Services designates the animal, reduce the struggling of the horses and get them the care that they need.      </p>
<p>This documentary’s timing and release is critically important. The point of this documentary is to outline the current situation of 150 feral horses facing possible extinction on Cumberland Island at the hands of the National Park Service.

<h3>K-Cups® are everywhere and the waste is too</h3>Single

The Mrauk-U area - site of the last fabulous and historic royal kingdom - is the most affected by the floods. The impact includes: 46 (and climbing) dead, 200,000 (and climbing) people displaced, damaged infrastructure and caused loss of 5000 hectares of cultivated agricultural land. People are in dire need of clean drinking water, food, shelter, and basic sanitation. Loss of life on a massive scale is a very real possibility, and the crisis is expected to worsen.   The accumulated impact of successive floods, tropical storms and cyclones has increased the vulnerability of the affected population and exhausted their coping mechanisms.

Replacement bees. It is approaching the height of the season in the UK and it already too late to be splitting remaining stocks in an attempt to replace the losses. Splitting the remaining stocks is possible but runs the risk of them not getting up to strength to survive the winter and, more importantly, our increasingly unpredictable spring time.


Food. These bees will need food supplied by me until the house bees grow up to foragers.


Queens. It might be necessary to buy new queens as the current queens may very well prove to have damaged ovaries

Back when it started, Franklin County allowed people in the townships to raise animals as long as they were on parcels of an acre or more. But then in 2013, the county passed a new zoning amendment saying that if you had less than five acres, you could have no more than 24 ducks, chickens, and rabbits, combined. All other livestock were prohibited.

<br/><p></p>
<p>According to the Ohio Revised Code, however, counties and townships have no authority to regulate agriculture on lots of more than five acres. Our farm is just a fraction of an acre too small to qualify for this exemption. There is a vacant lot next to our farm, though, that belongs to the county land bank, and they're offering us the chance to buy it. If we buy it, we'll have enough land to be allowed to raise animals again.<br/></p>

If the land bank should reject our bid for some reason, or if we go over our goal, we'll put the money towards making the best possible use we can of the land we already have.

They range from a simple ""thank you"" on our website for chipping in a dollar, to items for your own garden, to a weekend bed & breakfast stay at the house where it all started. We want you to be involved. Woodland Urban Farm is a park-like setting, mostly forest. People who go far enough back on our land say, ""Does this really count as urban farming?"" because it seems so secluded...but we border the property of East Linden Elementary School.

As Permaculture co-founder Bill Mollison once said, ""You don't have a slug problem, you have a duck deficiency."" To really care for this land, we need the help of animals, and to be allowed to have animals again, we need help from you. Please be a part of building Woodland Urban Farm in your community. If the land bank should reject our bid for some reason, or if we go over our goal, we'll put the money towards making the best possible use we can of the land we already have. That means things like more deer fencing, more gardens, a greenhouse, mushroom and aquaculture production...it just depends on how much money there is to work with.

Even if you can't afford to contribute any money, you can still help! Spread the word about this campaign. Buy our vegetables when they're ready. Call Curtiss Williams, Vice President of The Land Reutilization Corporation of Franklin County (614-525-4938), and let him know that you want Wayne Shingler to farm the vacant lot on Woodland Avenue. If your neighborhood or community group supports our using this land for farming (specifically, we're planning to fence it in and plant fruit trees), then please have your organization send us their name and contact information so we can submit it to the land bank with our offer.Special thanks to Elephant Revival for letting us use their song ""The Pasture"" in our video free of charge.

<p><b>Who Are We</b></p>
<p>We are a group of first year students from the faculty of
education at Sakon Nakhon Rajabhat University in North East Thailand. As
part of our education, we have been given the chance to work on, and address an
issue that we are personally passionate about. </p>
<p>As a group, we quickly agreed to place our focus, and
energy on environmental and global warming issues. The main reasons
for our choice was based on our daily observations of the lack of recycling and
overuse of plastic bags among our fellow students. </p>
<p>Moreover, our university are currently undergoing great expansion,
which great for us and our academic opportunities, however in this
process trees has to come down. We therefore wish to take an active role in replanting more trees.
 </p>
<p>Combating environmental and global warming issues might seem
like a big, and impossible task for a group of first year student from a
university in the north east of Thailand. However, we believe that this is our
strength. As university students, we have the potential to easily expose our
efforts to more than 12.000 students. </p>
<p>We believe, that we through our events, presentations and social
media efforts have a great opportunity to change the way many of our
fellow student are thinking about recycle, overuse of plastic bags, and the
importance of preserving and replanting trees. Thus creating a community of change agents for a cleaner and better environment for all of us to live in. </p>

What the Funds Will be Used For
The production part of the film has
been personally funded by the filmmaker, letting you know that she personally
contributed to this effort both physically, emotionally and financially.
Thousands of miles have been traveled
around the state, documenting rivers, lakes, and forests, as well as talking to
the people who live in New Mexico. Scientists have been interviewed from many
fields. The film is near completion, so will be available very soon. The funds will be used for
post-production costs such as DVD production and marketing so that the film can
get out to as many people as possible.
The filmmaker will be personally
involved in traveling around the state showing the film and talking about the
solutions presented.

Black Howla Ecolution, a fusion of revolution and the saving of our environment. 


Come be part of something special!
Whether you are one of our former guests, a future guest, or someone
who who has a love for and dedication to our beautiful, natural
world.


The Black Howla Ecolution is a work in
progress, dedicated to increasing our awareness of our relationship
to the world around us by providing a setting where we can reconnect
to our nature and the  nature that nurtures us. 



The cornerstone of the project is, over the last several years, Shane has developed a connection to a
small troop of howler monkeys that live in the area. They are totally
wild and free, in their natural state, but when he calls, they will
(often) come and interact and share a small bit of their world with
us.


The work in progress is to create a
place where others can come and share in that and other wonderful
experiences. In a setting where the mental and emotional pollution
that bombards us in the world today is minimized so that our true
feelings and connections can manifest. 
Over the last 10 years, we have been able to establish a solid foundation, developing an international reputation and many loyal followers. Now is the time to expand this project so we can have a greater impact on the local community as well as the world around us. Your participation will provide a tremendous boost, and allow us to extend our reach to many more individuals.


Specific projects and goals include:


Develop a small sustainable and
	ecofriendly community where people with similar goals and
	aspirations can come and share some time and experience our
	surroundings free (or at least with less) of the clutter that
	bombards us on a daily basis.


Create an interactive center where
	we can learn to appreciate the cultural and historic foundations we
	spring from.


Create a totally organic farm that
	produces most of the food consumed in the community, to demonstrate
	sustainable farming practices, and teach them to the surrounding
	community.


Create and stimulate economic
	development in the area where there is currently very little
	opportunity, to liberate the community from the day to day, hand to
	mouth pressures of being able to feed their families.



   What We Need & What You Get Specific projects that will be accomplished as we are able to raise funds with your help:



Continue to expand and
	preserve the habitat for black howler monkeys.


Build a series of small
	cabanas and camping facilities where people can come and spend time
	learning about our relationship to and responsibility for Mother Earth.


Develop a sustainable
	organic garden to provide all the food for our sanctuary project,
	and serve as a demonstration model for local people on how to

	local products that now often go to waste, such as cashew, mango,
	blackberry, cohune nuts, etc, to better utilize local resourses and
	provide stable economic support to their families.

The project will go forward, whether we are able to raise a little or a lot with your support. Obviously, the more we can raise, the faster and more wide ranging will be the impact of the project, but rest assured that every cent donated will go toward achieving the goals as outlined above.Check out the perks we offer as a way you can participate in this ""Ecolution"".
The Impact
 Due to hunting and habitat destruction, the howler monkey has become an endangered species. However, due to our efforts and those of many others, the trend has been reversed, and the monkeys are now gaining ground in the fight for survival. One of our primary projects is habitat preservation and the continuation of that trend.
Unfortunately, poverty often leads to practices that are not environmentely friendly, because of the necessity of providing for families. In an area where unemployment is often over 50% and under employment is almost universal, one of our major focuses is to promote the development of micro enterprises where local community members can develop markets for products that often go to waste, such as cashews, mango, blackberry, cohune nuts, etc. to better utilize local resources and provide stable economic support to their families, This can reduce the need for environmentally destructive practices such as clearing of rain forest, hunting of endangered species, etc. 
We currently provide stable employment for 10 members of the community, and that will multiply many times as the project progresses.
In addition, it will allow for people who have never had an opportunity for success to develop real careers, support their families, and contribute to the development of the community.
Risks & Challenges
 Change always invites resistance. ""We've always done it this way!"", ""What makes you think your way is better?""
But with a 10 year track record of building from the ground up, often without much outside support, and occasionally with resistance, we feel uniquely positioned for success and ready, with support from like minded people like you, to expand and make a real impact.   
The project will move forward. The speed at which it does will depend to a large degree on the amount of support we get from friends and neighbors who see and embrace our vision.
    Other Ways You Can Help Anything you can contribute to this project will aid in its success. No donation is too small.

<p><b>THE PROBLEM</b></p>
<p>3 billion people around the planet cook their meals over an
open flame or on a crude stove every day by burning wood, crop waste, and
animal dung. That’s nearly half the population of the world, Over 166 million
in India alone. These ways of cooking harm the environment as well as the
people forced to use them. Deforestation, CO2 and methane emissions are caused
by the use of firewood and animal waste – destroying the atmosphere and
creating respiratory problems in the users. </p>
<p>This issue has been around as long as cooking has. Then in
the 1960’s, Biogas came along as potential salvation – it failed.</p>
<p><b>WHAT HAPPENED?</b></p>
<p>Back in the 1960’s millions of Biogas units were installed
in India, but quickly lost favor with the local people because the units did
not function properly. They were complicated, broken easily, and were not
maintained by the installers.</p>
<p><b>SO WHAT DO WE DO?</b></p>
<p>SustainEarth uses innovative Biogas technology to provide
affordable, clean cooking gas to rural communities.</p>
<p>By rebranding the now-notorious Biogas product as Gau Gas
and implementing new materials, new processes, and new technology SustainEarth
will solve the problems faced by the last generation of Biogas users and
perhaps change some minds about the usefulness of Biogas.</p><p><b>OUR TECHNOLOGY </b></p><p>The Gau Gas digester is a low-cost hybrid flow biodigester that efficiently converts animal waste into clean, carbon-free cooking gas.

<div>Hi, my name's Tim Worstall. I'm known, if I'm known at all, as a journalist (Forbes, The Register, most UK papers at one time or another) writing on matters economic, tech, environmental. I'm usually an as dry as dust free marketeer but this project here is nothing to do with politics.</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">What we want to do is test how well people have absorbed the idea that it's better if we recycle everything. To do this we're going to create an app that claims to help in recycling something that just isn't nor cannot be recycled. The electrons in the current in a smartphone. The more people who download the free app the more we know that message, recycle everything! has been driven home.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This project is a reasonably serious piece of social science. We're going to do this in different languages and countries, we already have available stated preferences for recycling in different countries (through Pew Research, various European attitude surveys and so on). This will allow us to test revealed preference (by downloading) as against stated preference (what people tell pollsters) and economists like that sort of thing. Because they're pretty sure that what people do (revealed pref) is a better guide to what people really think than what people say (stated pref). That latter is easy enough to influence through social pressure and even social expectation. </span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">It's also clearly at least on the edge of being a practical joke. Given that the average life span of an electron is somewhere past the heat death of the universe they're not something that need recycling. Some tiny fraction do indeed meet an untimely death as a result of the positron emission form of radioactive decay from the trace amounts of uranium and or thorium in the metals the phone is made from but it's a trivial amount. So, err, har har, people will be downloading an app that doesn't really do anything.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We might also describe it as performance art: anyone who looks at this page will know that the app doesn't in fact recycle what cannot be recycled. But how many people will do that and how many will be taken in by any claims made? </span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">All of the above means we're not going to charge for the app of course.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>What We Need</b></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We need to do several things. We need to write an app of course but that, at this level, is simply trivial. Not something we would trouble your pocketbooks for. The core of the actual app will be simply the monitoring of the current flowing through the phone. A simple calculation then tells us how many electrons that is and we can flash up a little info box saying ""x squillions of electrons have not been destroyed in the operation of your phone"". We're not going to say that the app has recycled them, that would be untrue. Only that it has been monitoring this process, which will be true.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We also need to make the app actually do something. Apps that do nothing at all are rather frowned upon these days. So, we'll dig the open source version of a messaging app out of one of the vaults, put a skin on it and so the app will indeed do something. This is again trivial and we don't need to call on your resources to do it.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">There will be one version of this messaging app without the claims about electron recycling and one with. It will be the differential take up of these otherwise two identical apps which will tell us the most.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">What we do need help with is translation. Not so much of the app itself, as there's such source available in most languages even all. It's translating the skin and most importantly, the publicity material.

Hi, my name's Tim Worstall. I'm known, if I'm known at all, as a journalist (Forbes, The Register, most UK papers at one time or another) writing on matters economic, tech, environmental. I'm usually an as dry as dust free marketeer but this project here is nothing to do with politics.

What we want to do is test how well people have absorbed the idea that it's better if we recycle everything. To do this we're going to create an app that claims to help in recycling something that just isn't nor cannot be recycled. The electrons in the current in a smartphone. The more people who download the free app the more we know that message, recycle everything! has been driven home.

This project is a reasonably serious piece of social science. We're going to do this in different languages and countries, we already have available stated preferences for recycling in different countries (through Pew Research, various European attitude surveys and so on). This will allow us to test revealed preference (by downloading) as against stated preference (what people tell pollsters) and economists like that sort of thing. Because they're pretty sure that what people do (revealed pref) is a better guide to what people really think than what people say (stated pref). That latter is easy enough to influence through social pressure and even social expectation. 
It's also clearly at least on the edge of being a practical joke. Given that the average life span of an electron is somewhere past the heat death of the universe they're not something that need recycling. Some tiny fraction do indeed meet an untimely death as a result of the positron emission form of radioactive decay from the trace amounts of uranium and or thorium in the metals the phone is made from but it's a trivial amount. So, err, har har, people will be downloading an app that doesn't really do anything.
We might also describe it as performance art: anyone who looks at this page will know that the app doesn't in fact recycle what cannot be recycled. But how many people will do that and how many will be taken in by any claims made? 
All of the above means we're not going to charge for the app of course.
What We Need
We need to do several things. We need to write an app of course but that, at this level, is simply trivial. Not something we would trouble your pocketbooks for. The core of the actual app will be simply the monitoring of the current flowing through the phone. A simple calculation then tells us how many electrons that is and we can flash up a little info box saying ""x squillions of electrons have not been destroyed in the operation of your phone"". We're not going to say that the app has recycled them, that would be untrue. Only that it has been monitoring this process, which will be true.
We also need to make the app actually do something. Apps that do nothing at all are rather frowned upon these days. So, we'll dig the open source version of a messaging app out of one of the vaults, put a skin on it and so the app will indeed do something. This is again trivial and we don't need to call on your resources to do it.
There will be one version of this messaging app without the claims about electron recycling and one with. It will be the differential take up of these otherwise two identical apps which will tell us the most.
What we do need help with is translation. Not so much of the app itself, as there's such source available in most languages even all. It's translating the skin and most importantly, the publicity material. We can work for free on our little joke, performance art project, but we can't start asking translators to give up their bread and butter for our social science project. Well, we could, but we wouldn't get all that far we think.
So that's what we're looking for. There's some 20-25 languages worth targeting just here in Europe and even if it's just a few hundred $ per language that pretty soon adds up. That's why we're asking for the $7,000 we are (in the video I mention a slightly larger sum, that's because obviously we are also paying for some of this, plus doing the near trivial programming ourselves). Pretty much all of that is about translation, with a bit going to set up Cloud space, URL and so on, as and when people start using or testing it for sending messages. If anyone starts doing that in any volume of course then we've got to find more cash and fast, but that's not quite what we think will happen.
It's also not what we're really trying to test: we want to see the difference between just another messaging app and just another messaging app that claims to monitor how well electrons are being recycled. How much have people absorbed the idea that recycling of everything is a great idea? 
What can we give you in return for your support? Our thanks, obviously, a copy of the program itself of course, but as that's going to be free on release that's not hugely, amazingly, valuable. I had though of offering copies of my books until it was pointed out that people would probably want fewer of my books the more money they donated. 

So what we can offer is anything up to $10 is our thanks and a copy, $10 to $50 to be listed in the small print as a supporter of the project and anything above $50 as a sponsor in larger type.

Plus, of course, everyone will get a copy of those results from the experiment. Are there variations in take up across countries, how do those vary against stated propensities to recycle? 
If we're short of the total amount then we'll simply do less translation and do it in fewer countries. If we go over then we'll simply do more, both of marketing in each language, and expanding the languages.
As to what the impact on the wider world is, well, that's all rather in the eye of the beholder. We do think it's interesting to try and test revealed as against expressed preferences.

<div><p>Protecting the environment is a key policy objective for us
at Limitless Fuels. This biodiesel production facility will be a perfect demonstration
of how technology can be used to turn waste into an environment-friendly fuel. Biodiesel is an effective alternative
to fossil fuel. It delivers similar energy performance and can be used in
standard diesel engines without the need for any modifications. We hope that
this project will encourage even wider acceptance and use of biodiesel in South
Africa as this will not only help meet our energy needs, it will also reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. </p></div>
<h3>How This Idea Was Born</h3>
<div>My name is Alexander and my dream is to build the first commercial Biodiesel processing plant in the West Coast of South Africa. It all started when my father started distributing bulk cooking oil and occasionally collected the used oil and disposed of it appropriately. While visiting him I noticed a stockpile of about 3000 liters due to be disposed and thought to myself it's a pity all this oil will be going to waste. A few days later I started doing research into the Biodiesel process and soon it consumed me as the idea of renewable energy picked up momentum. I compiled a business plan and started approaching investors.  Because Biodiesel is in it's infancy in South Africa my idea was met with excitement and some doubt. I proceeded to build a small make shift processor and produced my first batch of Biodiesel, I started by sending samples for laboratory analysis and received feedback that I produced nearly perfect Biodiesel according to the South African National Standards. With that information in hand and some persistence the owner of the local fishing company pledged 50% of the funds required to build a Biodiesel processing plant capable of producing 40000 Liters per month.</div>
<div> I need to generate another $29,782 to be able to build my Biodiesel plant. </div>

<b>The
solution must be biological.</b> We must look to natural processes recognizing that
all life is made up of carbon that cycles between Earth and its atmosphere. Utilizing
the power of sunlight, through the process of photosynthesis, plants remove
carbon dioxide (CO2) from our atmosphere and with water (H2O) from the soil,
form complex carbohydrates (sugars) - the carbon comes from the CO2 and the
hydrogen from the H2O to form those carbohydrates. What’s left over is oxygen
which is released back into the atmosphere. And low-and-behold we and all the
other mammals on this planet are hooked on the stuff. So with the current
overload of CO2 in the atmosphere, and our need to breathe, we want as much photosynthesis
to happen as possible.<div><br/></div>

<br/><h2><b>Why
Grasslands?</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448383953/rvhjkizuefpebdeome67.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>Although
all plants photosynthesize, no vegetation type beats grasses, which cover a
greater area of the earth’s landmass than any other. And if that wasn’t enough,
unlike forests, grasslands store most of the carbon they sequester from the
atmosphere deep under the soil surface as organic matter, which actually
increases fertility and enhances soil life in countless ways. That is why the
great grain growing regions of the world are former grasslands, not
forests.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448384091/fpbv8tjgrskfavhcbxgf.jpg"" hspace=""5"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b>Grasslands
are the most important ecosystem for human civilization.</b> When healthy, they
purify the air, absorb and filter water and allow it to infiltrate back into
underground reservoirs, they support immeasurable wildlife and biodiversity,
and they build the deepest most fertile soils on the planet. <p></p>
<p><b>Grasslands are
also home to more than 1 billion people who depend on them for their food and
livelihoods.</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h2>What is
Holistic Planned Grazing?</h2>
<p>Surprisingly
though, grasses need to be grazed to thrive. At first it may sound
counter-intuitive, but in areas of the world that receive intermittent rainfall
and humidity, nature employs grazers to assist in biological decay. Grazers
carry healthy colonies of microbes in their rumen. These microbes have a symbiotic
relationship with their herbivorous hosts in that they are able to digest the
grass for the animals in exchange for a warm, moist, dark place to thrive, kind
of like a microbial womb.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href=""http://blog.ted.com/an-infographic-cheat-sheet-for-key-concepts-in-the-grazing-revolution/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448373462/dnaexriyr8j8g2l1xmbv.jpg"" hspace=""10"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<b>In the
past, large wild herds of herbivores such as caribou, buffalo, or wildebeest
occupied the grasslands - grazing, defecating, stomping and salivating as they
moved across them.</b> Over time, most wild herds disappeared and were replaced by
humans and their small numbers of sedentary livestock. Without the timely
stomping and excrement of large numbers of animals, and the subsequent period
of recovery when animals moved on, the cycle of biological decay in these
grasslands was interrupted and the once-rich soils and thriving prairies began
to degrade. Many of the grass plants were left ungrazed. Their dried-off leaves
blocked sunlight from reaching the growth buds at their bases and they started
to die. Much of the soil surface was left unbroken and unfertilized, making it
difficult for new grass seedlings to establish. <p></p>
<p>But we all
have been taught that grazing animals, particularly domestic livestock, can do
great damage to landscapes. We’ve seen it from our cars as we zoom down the
highway and the denuded countryside hums by. The difference is that domestic
livestock are usually scattered, rather than bunched in herds, and remain in
one place. At times they are rotated among pastures, but their rotations move too
quickly or too slowly to match the needs of the plants, soils, and other life
forms. Worse yet, Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) move all the
animals to one place, transport feed too them and haul away their wastes. These
industrial animal factories are prone to disease and are a source of air and
water pollution that adversely affects the communities neighboring them.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Grasslands
need to be properly grazed and grazing animals need to be on the grasslands. <b>To
mimic nature the animals need to be bunched and moving to provide the plants
enough time to fully recover between grazings.</b> Nature does this by using
predator pressure to keep the grazing animals constantly traveling and
impacting new areas of land. Domestic livestock need humans with smart and
comprehensive, holistic plans and great execution.</p>

<p>So Holistic
Planned Grazing is much more than rotational grazing and grass-finishing
livestock. It means land managers are planning for a whole lot of
considerations, including the desired outcomes for their land, livestock,
wildlife, and business, as well as their family’s quality of life. They plan
the movement of the livestock as much as a year in advance, and re-plan
on-goingly as they test their progress toward the achievement of those desired
outcomes - day in and day out.</p>

<h2><b>Increased
Water Supply</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448372649/ixd4yilbxkdd1bsnxcmw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>On degraded
or exposed land, water evaporates or runs off instead of soaking into the soil
where it is available for plants and living organisms and recharges water
tables. This runoff and evaporation leads to the increasing frequency and severity
of floods and droughts – even if there has been no change in rainfall in a
specific region.</div>
<div>  
<p>Holistic
Planned Grazing helps cover the soil surface, a crucial first step in stopping
degradation. Reduction of bare ground improves the effectiveness of the
available rainfall by minimizing evaporation and runoff.  Productivity
increases, and with it organic matter in the soil, which in turn increases its
ability to hold water, reducing the risk of floods and droughts. <b>Case
studies have shown a 40% increase in water holding capacity on land under
Holistic Planned Grazing compared to adjacent land that had no grazing on it.</b></p>

<p>In the
world’s vast grasslands, livestock production is the primary source of food
production. Healthier land can support more livestock, and more livestock,
means more wealth. When managed holistically in conjunction with livestock,
case studies have shown a 4x increase in profitability* as a result of better
soil and land health. </p>

managed livestock can be incorporated into cropping systems as well. Prior to
planting, a concentrated herd moves through a cropfield, the hooves breaking up
the soil surface and trampling down crop residues to cover the soil, and dung
and urine fertilizing it. This treatment promotes good germination, enhances
water infiltration, decreases evaporation, and eliminates the need for
additional fertilizers, plowing or ripping. Communal farmers using the
technique in Africa have increased maize yields by over 350% with no additional
inputs.</div>

<p>The Savory
Institute focuses its work on grasslands for all the reasons outlined above. We
believe grasslands provide the greatest hope for ensuring our climate remains
conducive to human life. </p>
<p><b>For the sake
of humanity’s future, our species must come together and recognize soil as the
only scalable and suitable vessel for the excess carbon in our atmosphere.</b>
Healthy soil is a living dynamic ecosystem and it is the foundation of life on
Earth. It is the basis for a sustainable and productive agriculture. </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>In the air
carbon in the form of carbon dioxide is a liability, heating our planet to
dangerous levels. In the soil it is a source of fertility, holding onto water,
and supporting more life. For these reasons we have started a multi-partner
initiative called Soil for Climate, and have launched the <b>#SoilManifesto</b> in
conjunction with the COP21 climate talks in Paris. Our aim is to unite Team
Humanity in demanding that our governments begin looking at grassland soils as
the ultimate carbon sink, and a crucial part of the solution to climate change.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>The
Challenge</b></h2>
<p>To achieve
lasting success and reverse our world’s current trajectory towards impending
doom, Savory Institute recognizes that we must have united global action. For
years the holistic management movement, including organizations before ours,
trained individuals and equipped them with the tools to change their own lives
and land. But these individuals did not have the resources or the support
network to unite across continents and truly become a movement. Six years ago
when<b> the Savory Institute was formed, its sole task was to develop strategies
and tools to orchestrate a truly global movement.</b> It is the only way to
effectively change the existing paradigm about grassland soils and livestock’s
role in keeping them healthy.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>What is a Hub</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>To create
the level of change necessary to start moving our planet toward global-scale
soil regeneration and thriving grasslands, we realized we needed to cultivate a
worldwide network of teams of entrepreneurial people working within their own
cultural context. </p>
<p>Each node
or Hub, as we call them, could act as a change-agent offering Holistic
Management trainings, one-on-one consulting, and on-going contextually relevant
implementation support. They would also provide local managers with the tools
needed to properly measure the health of the land and track its progress. They
would become the representatives in their region of our organization as well as
a much larger movement that their local and state governments could access.
They would also play the role of entrepreneurial incubators, and project
managers, developing enterprises in both established and emerging markets that
provide triple-bottom-line returns for land managers in their area. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>Over the
last 6 years, our BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) - our Hub dream - has become
a reality. <b>We now have close to 40 partners that have become Savory Network
Hubs or are in the process of being accredited.</b> They include individuals,
non-profits, for-profits, NGOs, and cooperatives - there is no one type of organization.
 Each Hub goes through a year-long on-boarding process. During this time
they get facilitation training on how to be good trainers and influencers in
their community. The get the most up to date training in Holistic Management,
plus training in business management and marketing, including one-on-one

</div></div>","It’s true. The grasslands may not seem like the world’s hottest eco
destination. They’re not as colorful as the rainforests or coral reefs. But you
don’t have to visit the grasslands to understand the power these ecosystems
hold. Like the power to reverse climate change. The power to prevent floods,
fire, drought, famine, and violence. And even the power to end world poverty.
But through mismanagement, the world’s grasslands are transforming into sandy
wastelands.
The Savory
Institute is at the forefront of the fight to save the grasslands. But we can’t
do it without you.Since our
founding in 2009, we have been working tirelessly to restore the natural cycles
of the grasslands. The engine driving this restorative process? Grazing animals
like cattle, sheep, and goats, properly managed. These animals till and
fertilize the earth. Their manure combines with decomposing vegetation to build
soil, preventing erosion and flooding. Grass flourishes, removing more carbon
from the atmosphere. And land managers can raise more nutrient-dense food to
feed the world. 
All of this
is made possible via a revolutionary process called Holistic Management, which
empowers managers to make wise decisions about their land. How do we spread the
word about this process? Physical spaces called Savory Hubs, located in key
areas around the world.
These hubs
are built and run by local innovators and entrepreneurs on the cutting edge of
land management. They’re an invaluable resource for other managers in the
region — a reservoir of information, training, demonstration, and fresh
thinking around regenerative and profitable management. We support these hubs
by giving them the tools and resources to help land managers succeed. 

Each Savory
Hub impacts 10 million hectares (24 million acres) of land. By 2025, we’ll have
everything in place to impact 1 one billion hectares — the critical mass needed
to start reversing climate change. But big changes take small steps. Our goal
is to see the creation of 10 new Savory Hubs each year. Your donations will
help make the next generation of hubs a reality. Together, we can reverse
climate change, end global hunger, and save the grasslands from turning into
wastelands. 



The
Problem



Currently, the intergovernmental efforts centered on climate change focus
solely on reducing emissions from burning fossil fuels. While this absolutely
MUST happen, it does nothing to address the legacy load of greenhouse gases
already in our atmosphere. Without a way to remove the existing carbon dioxide and other
warming agents from the atmosphere, our planet is doomed. We’re currently
seeing the effects with massive storms, floods and droughts. Those effects are
only going to get worse.
  
The
Solution
You may
have seen our founder, Allan Savory, in his TED Talk which has become one of
the top 100 most viewed TED talks of all time with nearly 3.5 million views on
the TED site alone.


Some of the
world’s wealthiest philanthropists and brightest minds have sought to develop
carbon capture technology that pulls carbon out of the air and either puts it
to use in manufacturing or stores it away safely. While some technologies along
these lines have been explored, the reality is that none of them can begin to
address the problem on a global scale, and all are likely to be accompanied by
unintended consequences. 


The
solution must be biological. We must look to natural processes recognizing that
all life is made up of carbon that cycles between Earth and its atmosphere. Utilizing
the power of sunlight, through the process of photosynthesis, plants remove
carbon dioxide (CO2) from our atmosphere and with water (H2O) from the soil,
form complex carbohydrates (sugars) - the carbon comes from the CO2 and the
hydrogen from the H2O to form those carbohydrates. What’s left over is oxygen
which is released back into the atmosphere. And low-and-behold we and all the
other mammals on this planet are hooked on the stuff. So with the current
overload of CO2 in the atmosphere, and our need to breathe, we want as much photosynthesis
to happen as possible.

Why
Grasslands?




Although
all plants photosynthesize, no vegetation type beats grasses, which cover a
greater area of the earth’s landmass than any other. And if that wasn’t enough,
unlike forests, grasslands store most of the carbon they sequester from the
atmosphere deep under the soil surface as organic matter, which actually
increases fertility and enhances soil life in countless ways. That is why the
great grain growing regions of the world are former grasslands, not
forests.  


Grasslands
are the most important ecosystem for human civilization. When healthy, they
purify the air, absorb and filter water and allow it to infiltrate back into
underground reservoirs, they support immeasurable wildlife and biodiversity,
and they build the deepest most fertile soils on the planet. 
Grasslands are
also home to more than 1 billion people who depend on them for their food and
livelihoods.

What is
Holistic Planned Grazing?
Surprisingly
though, grasses need to be grazed to thrive. At first it may sound
counter-intuitive, but in areas of the world that receive intermittent rainfall
and humidity, nature employs grazers to assist in biological decay. Grazers
carry healthy colonies of microbes in their rumen. These microbes have a symbiotic
relationship with their herbivorous hosts in that they are able to digest the
grass for the animals in exchange for a warm, moist, dark place to thrive, kind
of like a microbial womb.


In the
past, large wild herds of herbivores such as caribou, buffalo, or wildebeest
occupied the grasslands - grazing, defecating, stomping and salivating as they
moved across them. Over time, most wild herds disappeared and were replaced by
humans and their small numbers of sedentary livestock. Without the timely
stomping and excrement of large numbers of animals, and the subsequent period
of recovery when animals moved on, the cycle of biological decay in these
grasslands was interrupted and the once-rich soils and thriving prairies began
to degrade. Many of the grass plants were left ungrazed. Their dried-off leaves
blocked sunlight from reaching the growth buds at their bases and they started
to die. Much of the soil surface was left unbroken and unfertilized, making it
difficult for new grass seedlings to establish. 
But we all
have been taught that grazing animals, particularly domestic livestock, can do
great damage to landscapes. We’ve seen it from our cars as we zoom down the
highway and the denuded countryside hums by. The difference is that domestic
livestock are usually scattered, rather than bunched in herds, and remain in
one place. At times they are rotated among pastures, but their rotations move too
quickly or too slowly to match the needs of the plants, soils, and other life
forms. Worse yet, Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) move all the
animals to one place, transport feed too them and haul away their wastes. These
industrial animal factories are prone to disease and are a source of air and
water pollution that adversely affects the communities neighboring them.




Grasslands
need to be properly grazed and grazing animals need to be on the grasslands. To
mimic nature the animals need to be bunched and moving to provide the plants
enough time to fully recover between grazings. Nature does this by using
predator pressure to keep the grazing animals constantly traveling and
impacting new areas of land. Domestic livestock need humans with smart and
comprehensive, holistic plans and great execution.


So Holistic
Planned Grazing is much more than rotational grazing and grass-finishing
livestock. It means land managers are planning for a whole lot of
considerations, including the desired outcomes for their land, livestock,
wildlife, and business, as well as their family’s quality of life. They plan
the movement of the livestock as much as a year in advance, and re-plan
on-goingly as they test their progress toward the achievement of those desired
outcomes - day in and day out.


A recent
study conducted in Australia demonstrated a 400% increase in permanent soil
carbon on land under Holistic Planned Grazing, relative to the neighboring land
managed conventionally.

Increased
Water Supply

On degraded
or exposed land, water evaporates or runs off instead of soaking into the soil
where it is available for plants and living organisms and recharges water
tables. This runoff and evaporation leads to the increasing frequency and severity
of floods and droughts – even if there has been no change in rainfall in a
specific region.
  
Holistic
Planned Grazing helps cover the soil surface, a crucial first step in stopping
degradation. Reduction of bare ground improves the effectiveness of the
available rainfall by minimizing evaporation and runoff.  Productivity
increases, and with it organic matter in the soil, which in turn increases its
ability to hold water, reducing the risk of floods and droughts. Case
studies have shown a 40% increase in water holding capacity on land under
Holistic Planned Grazing compared to adjacent land that had no grazing on it.

 


Food
Security and Poverty



In the
world’s vast grasslands, livestock production is the primary source of food
production. Healthier land can support more livestock, and more livestock,
means more wealth. When managed holistically in conjunction with livestock,
case studies have shown a 4x increase in profitability* as a result of better
soil and land health. 

Properly
managed livestock can be incorporated into cropping systems as well. Prior to
planting, a concentrated herd moves through a cropfield, the hooves breaking up
the soil surface and trampling down crop residues to cover the soil, and dung
and urine fertilizing it. This treatment promotes good germination, enhances
water infiltration, decreases evaporation, and eliminates the need for
additional fertilizers, plowing or ripping. Communal farmers using the
technique in Africa have increased maize yields by over 350% with no additional
inputs.
 



Holistic
planned grazing is successful because it is cost-effective, highly scalable and
nature-based.  It is sustainable because it increases wealth and
quality-of-life for landowners without compromising the long-term viability of
the resource base.

Healthy
Soil





The Savory
Institute focuses its work on grasslands for all the reasons outlined above. We
believe grasslands provide the greatest hope for ensuring our climate remains
conducive to human life. 
For the sake
of humanity’s future, our species must come together and recognize soil as the
only scalable and suitable vessel for the excess carbon in our atmosphere.
Healthy soil is a living dynamic ecosystem and it is the foundation of life on
Earth. It is the basis for a sustainable and productive agriculture. 




In the air
carbon in the form of carbon dioxide is a liability, heating our planet to
dangerous levels. In the soil it is a source of fertility, holding onto water,
and supporting more life. For these reasons we have started a multi-partner
initiative called Soil for Climate, and have launched the #SoilManifesto in
conjunction with the COP21 climate talks in Paris. Our aim is to unite Team
Humanity in demanding that our governments begin looking at grassland soils as
the ultimate carbon sink, and a crucial part of the solution to climate change.

The
Challenge
To achieve
lasting success and reverse our world’s current trajectory towards impending
doom, Savory Institute recognizes that we must have united global action. For
years the holistic management movement, including organizations before ours,
trained individuals and equipped them with the tools to change their own lives
and land. But these individuals did not have the resources or the support
network to unite across continents and truly become a movement. Six years ago
when the Savory Institute was formed, its sole task was to develop strategies
and tools to orchestrate a truly global movement. It is the only way to
effectively change the existing paradigm about grassland soils and livestock’s
role in keeping them healthy.

What is a Hub





To create
the level of change necessary to start moving our planet toward global-scale
soil regeneration and thriving grasslands, we realized we needed to cultivate a
worldwide network of teams of entrepreneurial people working within their own
cultural context. 
Each node
or Hub, as we call them, could act as a change-agent offering Holistic
Management trainings, one-on-one consulting, and on-going contextually relevant
implementation support. They would also provide local managers with the tools
needed to properly measure the health of the land and track its progress. They
would become the representatives in their region of our organization as well as
a much larger movement that their local and state governments could access.
They would also play the role of entrepreneurial incubators, and project
managers, developing enterprises in both established and emerging markets that
provide triple-bottom-line returns for land managers in their area. 



Over the
last 6 years, our BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) - our Hub dream - has become
a reality. We now have close to 40 partners that have become Savory Network
Hubs or are in the process of being accredited. They include individuals,
non-profits, for-profits, NGOs, and cooperatives - there is no one type of organization.
 Each Hub goes through a year-long on-boarding process. During this time
they get facilitation training on how to be good trainers and influencers in
their community. The get the most up to date training in Holistic Management,
plus training in business management and marketing, including one-on-one
coaching as they develop their business plans. We also connect Hubs through a
communications platform that enables the network as a whole to sharpen and
enhance each Hub’s skills. 


Armed with
the Savory Institute’s curriculum and state of the art data management tools,
each Hub makes its own plan on how to impact its region and to be financially
sustainable in providing local solutions to land degradation, food and water
security, and community empowerment. 






Each Hub has a holistically managed demonstration site, where all aspects of Holistic Management, including Holistic Planned Grazing, are embraced. These sites serve as a training venue and learning laboratory, but also as a center of action, research and excellence. They give local people of all skill levels a place to gather and commune with the land, learn the holistic planning processes at their own pace, and expand their knowledge and skills in a safe environment with no risk to their own livelihood.

Join Us
in Creating a Future of Hope


With your
gift you’ll be helping us empower pastoralists, ranchers and
farmers around the globe through the establishment of Hubs to assist them in
their efforts. You’ll help us reach even further into some of the world’s most
remote regions, to help bring the most refined tools and curriculum to the 500
million family farmers feeding the majority of the world’s population. 
In the
hustle and bustle of everyday life it’s easy to forget the environment we
depend on. But we ask you to please consider helping us save the grasslands in
your year-end giving. 


The time is
now. There is nothing more important for the sake of humanity than reversing
climate change and desertification and the solution is so simple. We don’t need
to develop new technology, or vast infrastructure, or pool the world’s
resources, or amass inconceivable treasuries.  We simply need to reach
land managers and show them how they can modify the use of the tools and
resources they have now. 

Over the
last few decades, Allan Savory and the Savory Institute have had success on
every habitable continent and positively impacted over 50 million hectares
already. Just since 2013 when we launched our Hub strategy, over 10 million
hectares have been positively influenced. With our burgeoning network of
thriving Hubs that number is now growing exponentially! 

Join us in restoring the health of the
grasslands, regenerating soils, and reversing climate change.

Based in Faribault Minnesota on what was once conventional farm land, we transitioned 3 acres of previously mono-cropped land and 7 acres of pasture into a GMO-free, pesticide-free permaculture food forest. With the help of the Organic Compound volunteer groups, we have planted tens of thousands of perennial and annual fruit and nut trees, not to mention loads of vegetables! We are well on our way to a regenerative future. By taking the time to learn and understand our local habitat, we have found many ways to live in collaboration with the earth. We actively dehydrate, can, pickle and ferment our food. Wild foods and medicines are annually foraged from the land as well. Last year, The Organic Compound managed to obtain a saw mill to produce our own local lumber and we continue to find creative ways to be regenerative.

Based in Faribault Minnesota on what was once conventional farm land, we transitioned 3 acres of previously mono-cropped land and 7 acres of pasture into a GMO-free, pesticide-free permaculture food forest. With the help of the Organic Compound volunteer groups, we have planted tens of thousands of perennial and annual fruit and nut trees, not to mention loads of vegetables! We are well on our way to a regenerative future. By taking the time to learn and understand our local habitat, we have found many ways to live in collaboration with the earth. We actively dehydrate, can, pickle and ferment our food. Wild foods and medicines are annually foraged from the land as well. Last year, The Organic Compound managed to obtain a saw mill to produce our own local lumber and we continue to find creative ways to be regenerative. We are weaving a web of regeneration and coexistence. Through collaboration and cooperation with local organizations and communities, we are actively sharing knowledge and direct experience of our contributive and caring way of being. In our quest to develop an energy self sufficient infrastructure for our farm, we asked ourselves: ""What are tangible goals we can set in this intention of regeneration and resilience which our wider community can support with confidence?""   We came up with several solutions, these are the three main strategies: 1. Building up our SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE: creating an outdoor kitchen, outdoor shower, and more places for people to inhabit while they are learning and contributing to the land. Our visions for the land here are expanding and so must our capacity to have the extra hands here to support these projects! 2. Build a ROOT CELLAR for Produce Storage: This passive geothermal technology has been proven effective by generations of people. A Root Cellar will allow us to store our harvested food and live a more sustainable life through the winter season. 3. GO SOLAR:The sun that grows our plants has the power to run our facilities! Going solar will increase our energy independence and reduce our carbon footprint.  These combined efforts will dramatically impact the Organic Compounds’ ability to further our vision of land-based education, increase our long-term resilience, decrease our energy dependence, and create a source of renewable energy to power our facilities. What does this look like?In Total We Need:  $45,000 and your HELP!  Our Sustainability Solutions come in three phases.  PHASE ONE: Creating an outdoor kitchen, shower, and seasonal living spaces. We plan to use recycled, reclaimed, Organic Compound milled-wood for these projects, and lots of our skilled friends and family to complete the projects. Infrastructure Needs: $9,800 ~For our outdoor kitchen space, we will be using an existing concrete slab as our foundation and utilizing rammed tire construction for the walls of the kitchen. We will use our own saw mill to cut any wood needed for framing, tin for the roof (better to catch rain water with!) and recycled materials for the cabinets within the kitchen. We estimate the cost of this being $4,500. ($3,000 for the roof, and $1,500 for screen, cabinets, door, sink, and other misc)  ~We will also be creating an outdoor wash house. The wash house will have a shower (made with reclaimed tile and earth-based construction) and a washer, so that our interns and guests can have access to these basic necessities. Our estimate for this phase is $1,600. ($350 for piping, $150 for washer, $200for tile, $250 for the roof, and $650 for the structure itself)  ~Finally we will be screening in four 9’ by 9’platform structures and adding roofs to make rain and mosquito free zones for our seasonal interns and guests. We will be using wood from our mill as well as screen and tin-roofs for these enclosures. We estimate the total cost being approximately $3,700. ($800 for wood, $2,400for the metal roof, and $500 for the screen)  PHASE TWO: Before moving into stage three of our solar electric aspirations we need to reduce the amount of power we need. One way we will do that is by Building a Root Cellar! Root cellar/ice house needs: $7,200.00 total ~With you & all of your friends with shovels and a couple of weekends, we can dig a 10' deep, 10' Wide, 24’ long hole, or we can pay an excavator $2,300.00 for their services. It just depends on how low impact we want to be with our install. We are talking about sustainability, right? ~For the Walls, we will be using re-claimed tires to do rammed earth construction! After the walls are up, we will use an earthen clay mix to seal the walls. This phase is practically free since we have all the materials on the land, but we will need your help to do it! BONUS, this is a great learning opportunity!~For our floor, we will be using gravel rather than concrete to further reduce our environmental impact. The estimated cost for the gravel is approximately $300. ~$3,200.00 for waterproofing and insulating, we still need your help with labor, and finally another $1,400.00 for concrete, rebar and forms for the roof. Bring your friends with shovels!  PHASE THREE: is a grid tied ground mounted solar array. The ~$28,000.00 is for: 24 Canadian Solar 295w modules, a 7kw Schnieder Electric, Outback or Sunny Boy grid tied inverter, an Iron Ridge ground mount racking system, and all of the ""Balance of System"" parts to interconnect with the electric grid. This solar system will produce 36 kilowatt hours of energy per day which will meet about 80% or our current electrical needs. We hope, with time and added intent, we will be able to reduce our electrical needs so that this system will actually produce MORE than enough for our electrical needs. We will then need your help to assemble the racking system and mount the modules before we have an electrician come and hook us up to the electric grid. (If you are an electrician that can handle this please reach out!) You are contributing to a farm revolution. We are creating a model for others to adopt. With our ability to outreach and share our story with so many people in our community, we believe we are creating a space that will empower and inspire people for many years to come. Using advanced permaculture design and working with elements on the land, we will continue to explore new sustainable, regenerative ways of being.  Other Ways You Can Help We understand that some people simply cannot contribute financially.

<p>We plan for:</p>
<p></p>

<li>Documentation on this goddess of a river which is facing its death;</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A documentary film to premiere in Spring 2017;</span></li>

<li>Media events to spread the intent &amp; the messaging of the expedition far and wide;</li>
<li>2 strong calls to action - Disincentives for usage of plastic bags as well as working with WaterAid for advocacy against disposal of untreated sewage into the Ganges</li>
</ul>
<br/><p><b>The context for the Project</b></p>
<p>The Ganges or Ma Ganga is not
only a critical pillar of India's cultural and spiritual identity but
also one of the most prominent and significant rivers of the world.
In the words of India's first prime minister - '<i>The
story of the Ganges, from her source to the sea, from old times to
new, is the story of India’s civilization and culture, of the rise
and fall of empires, of great and proud cities, of adventures of man'.</i></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Ganga river basin is one
of the largest river systems in the world, supporting not only over a
12th of the world's population but also numerous
diverse ecosystems, from the alpine forests near Gaumukh to the
plains of northern India to the mangrove forests and saline mud flats
of West Bengal.</span></p>
<p><b>This river-of-life however, is
now facing an accelerated death due to the immense strain placed on
it due to human activity and interference. The challenges of the Ganges are similar to those faced by water bodies around the world - issues that are of global relevance and urgency as all this waste and these pollutants end up in our oceans, endanger marine life and eventually find their way in our bodies through the food chain. </b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The pollution and threats to the Ganges have many origins at different points along the river and is easier to understand by dividing the river system into three main geographical regions along its main course: 1. Upper Ganga Region: the origin of the river in the lap of the Himalayas 2. Middle Ganga Region: the river as it meanders through the plains, where it is the most heavily populated.   3. Lower Ganga Region: the delta region as the river meets with Ganga Sagar.

<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">So Why Stand Up Paddleboarding?</b></p>
<p>Stand Up Paddlboarding (SUP) is not only the world's fastest growing watersport but is also an incredibly accessible sport, all one really needs is water and a paddle+paddleboard to  practice it. The advent of inflatable paddleboards has made it even easier to 'travel with'. The  sport also gives unrivaled visibility both inside and outside water.</p>

we are</b><br/></p>
<p>We are a three person
international team of Shilpika 'Shilps' (female, Indian), Spike (male,
British &amp; Irish) and Pascal (male, German).</p>
<p>In late 2015, the idea of
GangeSUP germinated from Shilps' burning dream to combine her love
for adventure, a desire to discover more of her motherland via an
'immersive' &amp; 'slow travel' mode (having been away from India for
a decade) &amp; most importantly realizing the need to create a
constructive &amp; engaging dialogue for the very very serious
problem of water pollution. Meeting Spike via London's fitness and
adventure community led to the seed of the idea growing into a
tangible expedition format and with Pascal's addition to the team in
the form of an environmental scientist, we bring together what we
think are essential components for this expedition team's
adventure-for-purpose.</p>
<p>As a team we are united by our
passion for impacting and creating sustainable change, for pushing
the boundaries of stereotypes &amp; comfort and for empowering
purpose via adventure.</p>
<p>We also bring a range of
complementary skills and backgrounds to this expedition as below –</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Besides this core team of 3, we are
fortunate to have some passionate adventure and environment
enthusiasts join us for shorter phases of the expedition along the
river.</span><br/></p>
<p>We are forever indebted to our wider team of family, friends and sponsors and partners, without whom this idea may have never actualized.</p>
<p><b>The Expedition plan (Well Plan A in any case!)</b></p>
<p>Kicking off in the final week of September 2016, our expedition itinerary is broadly divided into 3 phases – </p>
<p>Taking into account rest stops, community engagement projects and likely safety/health concerns, we expect the expedition to take up to 3 months </p>
<p>- Phase 1 Week of 28th September - Commence the 270km odd trek from Gaumukh +Gangotri, 4100metres high in the Himalays (i.e. the source) down to just below the Tehri Dam. We expect this to take approx 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Phase 2 Week of 10th October -Tehri Dam to Haridwar – We will be getting on our inflatable stand up paddleboards at just below Tehri Dam / near Devprayag and will aim for Haridwar through the white waters (approx 70 kms with rapids upto Grade 6).</p>
<p>Phase 3 Haridwar to Ganga Sagar – We will be swapping to our hard stand up paddle boards from Haridwar and embarking on the longest phase of our journey until Ganga Sagar.<b><br/></b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>OK but have you done ANYTHING like this before?</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">To prepare for this journey we have just finished the first 307 km long source to sea descent of the river Shannon by paddleboard.  This Irish river is the longest river in the British Isles and the expedition took us roughly 2 weeks agains the backdrop of constant headwinds, heavy rain but unfailing and lovely Irish hospitality. We were lucky to get some Media love as below:<br/></span></p>

<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Why are we asking for your support ?</b></p>
<p>So far the expedition is <b>completely Self-Funded </b>barring equipment support from our incredible partners . This project has now been 9 months in planning and is a huge (yet super rewarding) feat to undertake -Shilps has been dedicated to it full time for this duration &amp; Spike and Pascal have also spent considerable effort in getting us to this stage - Between expedition logistics, training expedition in Ireland, insurance, plane tickets,  expedition gear, filming, photography and editing of the film , our budget is to the tune of GBP 50,000+. The great news is that we are GBP 28,000 of the way there already ! </p>
<p><b>We really really really NEED your support for the remaining GBP 22,000+  (BRExit has made our funding goal about 12% higher than initially estimated) which is broadly split as follows:</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>- </b></span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">GBP 13,500: India Specific Expedition Safety &amp; logistics</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> - In its leanest and meanest form, this includes but is not limited to -State specific permissions to be on the river, support vehicle, white water support, local fixers where needed. Our conviction to do this Expedition completely unsupported has been gradually chipped away due to reinforcement of local concerns regarding the risks mentioned above. </span></p>
<p><b>- GBP 1000-1500: Scientific Experiments and cost of sample analysis.</b></p>
<p><b>- GBP 7000: Production of the Expedition Documentary, editing, post production - </b>We consider  our work and purpose left unfinished if we cannot share our findings on the river with a global audience, in a raw, authentic and unbiased form - this will be by the means of  a post expedition documentary film which we will also use to fundraise for our Charity Partners, including WaterAid India.</p>
<p>All funding will go directly to the project- Please donate if you are so engaged, inspired and are able. Every single contribution counts and we greatly value all support we receive—moral, fiscal, and social.  </p>
<p>As we currently stand today w.r.t gear and monetary position - we are fully in a position to undertake the expedition as per plan - the difference between funding and lack of, is jeopardizing our safety and health and not being able to expand the environmental and social impact of this expedition beyond the adventure. We are only going to attempt this particular journey once, so we want to really push the boundaries of what impact and change we can create through it.</p>
<p>We are also confident that there are plenty of like minded individuals out there who care passionately and deeply for cleaner waters and will help us reach our Funding goal, enabling us to honor our Campaign Rewards.</p>
<p>For the Rewards themselves, we were very keen on not listing anything that might be an additional burden on the environment and more importantly where we would be able to engage with our backers as much as possible.  Please take a look at our rewards list and we hope that there will be something you will like!</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>This is the reality of the human impact on our rivers and our oceans today - Recognizing, addressing and taking action against water pollution is essential to life, to human survival, to civilization itself. </p>

<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/>
</h3>
<div>We often say in our team that if this adventure did not come fraught with risks, it would not be an expedition. <b>Our mantra however, is to be Risk Aware, not Risk Averse.  </b>We have undertaken extensive risk assessment exercises for the expedition, put contingency measures in place and will continue to revise and update the plan as we go along the river and as and when we have new information. We have comprehensive insurance &amp; as a team have extensive experience on the paddleboards as well as in expedition management. If we can find the funding, we will also have on ground support which will be critically useful. Additionally, we have an Indian on the team who speaks the language (s) as well as understand the cultural and social nuances of the areas we will pass through.  </div>
<div>Broadly the major <b>Risks </b>are:</div>
<div>-River itself - white water, strong currents, changing flow due to heavy monsoons, crocodiles &amp; other wild life, submerged &amp; visible hazards;</div>
<div>-River pollution - which creates a wide array of difficulties ranging from sourcing cleaner water to causing serious illness;</div>
<div>-Remoteness - which will impact communication, evacuation if needed, resupplies etc.</div>
<div>-People on the banks themselves (theft, assault etc.);</div>
<div>-Equipment failure.</div>
<p></p>
<p>Besides the adventure specific aspects, our big <b>Challenges </b>are:</p>
<p>-To authentically tell a story of the river and its people using a combination of anecdotal evidence, citizen science, photo, footage &amp; writing;</p>
<p>-To crystallize the format of the legacy we would like to leave post expedition;</p>
<p>-To get our message out to as many people as possible, to engage them enough to create momentum and empower action.</p>

</div></div>","Thank you for Stopping By - You support is very gratefully and humbly received. A quick round up of the Project and why it mattersGangesSUP's Goals are :#PaddleForChange - Using the Power of adventure to understand the very serious problem of water pollution  via citizen science, community clean up projects, simple call to actions and citizen advocacy. #AdventureInyourOwnBackyard - Showcase the immense accessibility of the SUP sport as a means of creating additional Eco-tourism opportunities in India’s great outdoors. While also improving youth and individual engagement in environmental issues via  something aspirational and cool.#SUPAgainstSUP - We are aware that cleaning rivers is a long term, often politically charged matter, hence we are focusing on causes of water pollution that are visible, do not require huge barriers for considerable improvement and see a huge improvement with the littlelest of governance changes.   We are focusing on raising awareness against single use plastic (SUP)- i.e #SUPagainstSUP (stand-up paddleboarding against single-use plastic) and other causes of pollution that are more readily addressable (e.g. treatment of sewage waste before it goes into the river). Our Project Deliverables
We plan for:


Documentation on this goddess of a river which is facing its death;
A documentary film to premiere in Spring 2017;
Analysis of the condition of the river & the water via sampling where possible, anecdotal evidence, interaction with local organisations and qualitative & human ecological questions;

Photography of the entire journey;

Regular Blogs, Vlogs, Social Media and Website updates as we travel;
Collaborative events such a 'Clean up drives', school visits & community interactions in the major hubs/cities along the river;

Media events to spread the intent & the messaging of the expedition far and wide;
2 strong calls to action - Disincentives for usage of plastic bags as well as working with WaterAid for advocacy against disposal of untreated sewage into the Ganges

The context for the Project
The Ganges or Ma Ganga is not
only a critical pillar of India's cultural and spiritual identity but
also one of the most prominent and significant rivers of the world.
In the words of India's first prime minister - 'The
story of the Ganges, from her source to the sea, from old times to
new, is the story of India’s civilization and culture, of the rise
and fall of empires, of great and proud cities, of adventures of man'.
The Ganga river basin is one
of the largest river systems in the world, supporting not only over a
12th of the world's population but also numerous
diverse ecosystems, from the alpine forests near Gaumukh to the
plains of northern India to the mangrove forests and saline mud flats
of West Bengal.
This river-of-life however, is
now facing an accelerated death due to the immense strain placed on
it due to human activity and interference. The challenges of the Ganges are similar to those faced by water bodies around the world - issues that are of global relevance and urgency as all this waste and these pollutants end up in our oceans, endanger marine life and eventually find their way in our bodies through the food chain. 
The pollution and threats to the Ganges have many origins at different points along the river and is easier to understand by dividing the river system into three main geographical regions along its main course: 1. Upper Ganga Region: the origin of the river in the lap of the Himalayas 2. Middle Ganga Region: the river as it meanders through the plains, where it is the most heavily populated.   3. Lower Ganga Region: the delta region as the river meets with Ganga Sagar. This is a very helpful graphic from Ganga Action Parivar -



Why does water pollution matter and Why the time for GangesSUP is now?





So Why Stand Up Paddleboarding?
Stand Up Paddlboarding (SUP) is not only the world's fastest growing watersport but is also an incredibly accessible sport, all one really needs is water and a paddle+paddleboard to  practice it. The advent of inflatable paddleboards has made it even easier to 'travel with'. The  sport also gives unrivaled visibility both inside and outside water.



Who
we are
We are a three person
international team of Shilpika 'Shilps' (female, Indian), Spike (male,
British & Irish) and Pascal (male, German).
In late 2015, the idea of
GangeSUP germinated from Shilps' burning dream to combine her love
for adventure, a desire to discover more of her motherland via an
'immersive' & 'slow travel' mode (having been away from India for
a decade) & most importantly realizing the need to create a
constructive & engaging dialogue for the very very serious
problem of water pollution. Meeting Spike via London's fitness and
adventure community led to the seed of the idea growing into a
tangible expedition format and with Pascal's addition to the team in
the form of an environmental scientist, we bring together what we
think are essential components for this expedition team's
adventure-for-purpose.
As a team we are united by our
passion for impacting and creating sustainable change, for pushing
the boundaries of stereotypes & comfort and for empowering
purpose via adventure.
We also bring a range of
complementary skills and backgrounds to this expedition as below –

More details on the team can be found
here -GangesSUP Team Profile
Besides this core team of 3, we are
fortunate to have some passionate adventure and environment
enthusiasts join us for shorter phases of the expedition along the
river.
We are forever indebted to our wider team of family, friends and sponsors and partners, without whom this idea may have never actualized.
The Expedition plan (Well Plan A in any case!)
Kicking off in the final week of September 2016, our expedition itinerary is broadly divided into 3 phases – 
Taking into account rest stops, community engagement projects and likely safety/health concerns, we expect the expedition to take up to 3 months 
- Phase 1 Week of 28th September - Commence the 270km odd trek from Gaumukh +Gangotri, 4100metres high in the Himalays (i.e. the source) down to just below the Tehri Dam. We expect this to take approx 2 weeks.
Phase 2 Week of 10th October -Tehri Dam to Haridwar – We will be getting on our inflatable stand up paddleboards at just below Tehri Dam / near Devprayag and will aim for Haridwar through the white waters (approx 70 kms with rapids upto Grade 6).
Phase 3 Haridwar to Ganga Sagar – We will be swapping to our hard stand up paddle boards from Haridwar and embarking on the longest phase of our journey until Ganga Sagar.
OK but have you done ANYTHING like this before?
To prepare for this journey we have just finished the first 307 km long source to sea descent of the river Shannon by paddleboard.  This Irish river is the longest river in the British Isles and the expedition took us roughly 2 weeks agains the backdrop of constant headwinds, heavy rain but unfailing and lovely Irish hospitality. We were lucky to get some Media love as below:

Why are we asking for your support ?
So far the expedition is completely Self-Funded barring equipment support from our incredible partners . This project has now been 9 months in planning and is a huge (yet super rewarding) feat to undertake -Shilps has been dedicated to it full time for this duration & Spike and Pascal have also spent considerable effort in getting us to this stage - Between expedition logistics, training expedition in Ireland, insurance, plane tickets,  expedition gear, filming, photography and editing of the film , our budget is to the tune of GBP 50,000+. The great news is that we are GBP 28,000 of the way there already ! 
We really really really NEED your support for the remaining GBP 22,000+  (BRExit has made our funding goal about 12% higher than initially estimated) which is broadly split as follows:
- GBP 13,500: India Specific Expedition Safety & logistics - In its leanest and meanest form, this includes but is not limited to -State specific permissions to be on the river, support vehicle, white water support, local fixers where needed. Our conviction to do this Expedition completely unsupported has been gradually chipped away due to reinforcement of local concerns regarding the risks mentioned above. 
- GBP 1000-1500: Scientific Experiments and cost of sample analysis.
- GBP 7000: Production of the Expedition Documentary, editing, post production - We consider  our work and purpose left unfinished if we cannot share our findings on the river with a global audience, in a raw, authentic and unbiased form - this will be by the means of  a post expedition documentary film which we will also use to fundraise for our Charity Partners, including WaterAid India.
All funding will go directly to the project- Please donate if you are so engaged, inspired and are able. Every single contribution counts and we greatly value all support we receive—moral, fiscal, and social.  
As we currently stand today w.r.t gear and monetary position - we are fully in a position to undertake the expedition as per plan - the difference between funding and lack of, is jeopardizing our safety and health and not being able to expand the environmental and social impact of this expedition beyond the adventure. We are only going to attempt this particular journey once, so we want to really push the boundaries of what impact and change we can create through it.
We are also confident that there are plenty of like minded individuals out there who care passionately and deeply for cleaner waters and will help us reach our Funding goal, enabling us to honor our Campaign Rewards.
For the Rewards themselves, we were very keen on not listing anything that might be an additional burden on the environment and more importantly where we would be able to engage with our backers as much as possible.  Please take a look at our rewards list and we hope that there will be something you will like!
The Impact
This is the reality of the human impact on our rivers and our oceans today - Recognizing, addressing and taking action against water pollution is essential to life, to human survival, to civilization itself. 





Risks & Challenges

We often say in our team that if this adventure did not come fraught with risks, it would not be an expedition. Our mantra however, is to be Risk Aware, not Risk Averse.  We have undertaken extensive risk assessment exercises for the expedition, put contingency measures in place and will continue to revise and update the plan as we go along the river and as and when we have new information. We have comprehensive insurance & as a team have extensive experience on the paddleboards as well as in expedition management. If we can find the funding, we will also have on ground support which will be critically useful. Additionally, we have an Indian on the team who speaks the language (s) as well as understand the cultural and social nuances of the areas we will pass through.  
Broadly the major Risks are:
-River itself - white water, strong currents, changing flow due to heavy monsoons, crocodiles & other wild life, submerged & visible hazards;
-River pollution - which creates a wide array of difficulties ranging from sourcing cleaner water to causing serious illness;
-Remoteness - which will impact communication, evacuation if needed, resupplies etc.
-People on the banks themselves (theft, assault etc.);
-Equipment failure.

Besides the adventure specific aspects, our big Challenges are:
-To authentically tell a story of the river and its people using a combination of anecdotal evidence, citizen science, photo, footage & writing;
-To crystallize the format of the legacy we would like to leave post expedition;
-To get our message out to as many people as possible, to engage them enough to create momentum and empower action.
There are many other ways of helping!!
We firmly believe that each one of you can meaningfully contribute to the campaign & our rivers  in myriad of other ways if not financially:

Spread the good word -You can help simply by spreading the message by word of mouth or via Facebook,Twitter & Instagram by using the hashtag #Paddleforchange and #SUPAgainstSUP - collective change & mobilisation has the power to save our rivers.                                                                                                                                          

Show us some Social Media Love by liking us on Facebook and following us on Twitter & Instagram.                                                                                                                 

#OneLess Pledge - Perhaps take a moment and reflect on  the role of Single-Use plastic in your life and find ways of cutting down on it - We need not all be on the water to find ways of making it cleaner.
Join Us - GangesSUP encourages you to join us on the expedition - you may be an environmentalist, a scientist, an adventure enthusiast or may simply want to explore a new country by human powered means - You are all welcome - just drop us a line on gangessup@gmail.com



Love & Luck - Please send good energy, positive thoughts, and your moral support as we make this very exciting, purposeful, yet dangerous journey.

<h2><strong>Are Bees Really That Important?</strong></h2>
<p>In 1900 a census of beekeepers revealed there were around 1 million honeybee hives in the UK.</p>
<p>In 2017 that number was around 220,000.</p>
<p>More recently, on 12th April 2018, The Independent newspaper revealed the decline in bees is putting the supply of raw materials for businesses at risk and honeybees are responsible for providing us with one third of the food we eat. They pollinate crops for food, biofuel, habitat for nature and flowers in the beautiful world we live. </p>
<p>Too Many T's are working with Bees for Business, bee farmers committed to installing 250 more honeybee hives here in England over the next 5 years and sowing 250 acres of unused land with organic, bee-friendly flower seeds.</p>
<p>They care for bees for some of the most iconic brands in Britain, including: ‘The Ned’ hotel, 'Nobu Hotel Shoreditch', Michelin-star ‘Restaurant Story’ in London and installed and manage the new apiary at Burghley House in Stamford.</p>
<p>The beehive adoption plans that Bees for Business offer are helping to reverse the decline of the honeybee, whilst simultaneously encouraging corporate social responsibility, all while providing our customers with their own-brand, 100% British, artisan, raw honey. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Humans Behind the Bees: Ethical, Artisan Bee Keepers</strong></h2>
<p>Jez, the beekeeper who owns Bees for Business, say ""we don't 'keep' bees; we care for them. We don't clip the queen's wings (so if they want to swarm, they can do, demonstrating natural behaviours) and we practice ethical beekeeping"".</p>
<p>With bees come a number of additional benefits, which by supporting his campaign, you'll be helping to support:</p>
<p>The team at Bees for Business provide employment and rehabilitation opportunities in gardening, beekeeping and honey processing for adults with educational and social needs; those recovering from stroke or mental health crisis. </p>
<p>They are champions for British, raw honey - it's completely unlike supermarket honey and converts almost all people who think they don't like honey!</p>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>Hey, my name is Vladi, I’m author of Garbie in Consumerland. Story of this project began when I was elite agent representing famous fashion models. My conscience was uneasy because this activity forced people to buy a lot of rubbish (they don’t really need) and feel inadequate about own appearance and long list of other things. One day I couldn’t carry on it and quit. </p>
<p>My previous life in overstuffed world of fashion inspired me to write a script unfolding in world of rubbish, which emerged on the ruins of our world after it had drowned in own consumption. My idea is to use real garbage for the setting of this world and animate it in stop motion. It imitates potential reality, as tragedy has already happened and we just film documentary. </p>
<p>I live in Kiev Ukraine, it’s still undeveloped country where issue of pollution and proper waste management is very urgent. Group of fantastic people and eco activists united around my idea to bring it to life. For several months we have been collecting garbage on the streets of our city, building from it Consumerland and animating.</p>
<p>Story reveals destiny of Garbie who choose the wrong path in life and got lost in dense forrest of various rubbish. While story unfolds Garbie discovers that she is on the path to plastic grave. Style of animation uses elements of horror films to terrify with plastic pollution. This is contemporary fairy tale which educates children and adults about present day forms of threats and evils. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Production of quality content aiming for global impact requires professional staff and sophisticated equipment. So far we were able to rise money from our close friends. Their funding got us to the final stage of production. At the moment we lack comparatively little amount to complete it. We need your help for final push. Any contribution is valuable for us, multiple drops of water create an ocean. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since Garbie in Consumerland is story without words, it has global potential to connect with most marginalized communities that need to hear the massage most. It’s composed of familiar cultural elements like classic fairy tales and pop icons and speaks on familiar language with people of various ages and nationalities, educating them about danger of plastic and creates intolerance to all forms of pollution, encourages to live in balance with nature, consume responsible and recycle. </p>
<p>In order to make impact on max audience, animation will be presented on prestigious movie/animation festivals than posted online where everyone can watch it for free. </p>
<p>We feel like we can put surprising twist on many other stories and we are going to produce new episodes in future. Next one is going to tell the story of Garbie in Polluted Ocean inhibited by plastic sharks and other scary creatures. Our goal is to create collection of fairy tales about modern day good and evil.</p>
<div> </div>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We evaluate the art, not in money, but in impact which it does for people, therefore we want to give it for free to everybody. However production is very expensive. If people find value in our art, they may contribute into production to make it possible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can do recycle and consume less plastic in your everyday life. If you can't help raise money for the project, you can at least talk  about plastic pollution problems, share the link or join our volonteer movement </p>

 My name is Barbara Bergen. In my 26 year career as

     Citizens’ Climate Lobby brought Tom Rand to Nelson, BC, where he spoke for
     an hour straight on the problems and solutions to climate change. People
     need to hear what he says, so we can find the collective will to avoid increasingly
     catastrophic weather events such as those we’ve seen lately, which are
     “just an appetizer” according to Rand.  <b>Changing the outcome on global warming is possible.</b> We just
     need to wake up and act. Rand shows us how.

<p>Tom Rand is simply the smartest guy in the
     room. With a BSc in electrical engineering, MSc in philosophy of
     science, an MA and PhD in philosophy, he is managing partner of the $30
     million MaRS Cleantech Fund, and sits on the board of several
     clean energy companies and organizations. He parlays
     with other bright minds at Stanford University, MIT and
     NASA.  He developed Planet Traveler, a low carbon hotel project
     in downtown Toronto. It contains many innovative energy designs, such as a
     lighting system that consumes about the same amount of energy as a toaster
     – that’s for the entire hotel.  He is a highly informed and
     compelling speaker, with frankly the most important message to be
     heard at this point in our history.  </p>

</ul>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>To get Rand's message out to a large
enough audience, we need to <b>get it onto
mainstream television</b>. The first stage is to create a campaign of
Public Service Announcements (PSAs for short) for Citizens’ Climate Lobby, to
publicize the main points that need to be acted upon immediately – this
represents about 10% of the budget. Next is a Pitch initiative, about 5% of the
budget, to pitch TV networks as well as funding bodies to cover any crowd
funding shortfall. Once all the funding is in place, we will produce the
documentary: Citizens’ Climate Lobby presents <b><i>Waking the Frog</i></b>, which
comprises about 85% of the budget.<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>What do you get out of the bargain?  A chance
     to do what may well be the most important thing you've ever
     done. You'll be a hero.<br/>
</li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire crowd funding goal, I
     will use whatever funds there are to first create the PSAs, then further
     the documentary project by soliciting completion funds from foundations. I
     have budgeted people and services at a sliding scale of pro bono to half
     their normal rates. Tom Rand has generously offered to be featured in the
     documentary pro bono – and if there is any money left from the budget for
     a fee, he will be donating it to Cape Farewell Canada, a charitable
     organization that brings artists, scientists and educators together to
     collectively engage the public on climate disruption and envision a
     resilient future.<br/>

<li>The challenge is inspiring collaborative action. The

We welcome thousands of school children, families, gardeners, farmers, students, community groups and elders to our beautiful Visitor Centre in Scarriff.  They come to see our  seed gardens, orchards, native woodlands and our school garden.

<p>Hi, I’m David Morgans, the creator of the Morganic Nature Beds. I’ve spent two decades understanding the way we work with urban lands; in landscaping and in housing, as well as living and working on farms. The outcome is a system which fills the need of consuming healthy and spiritually nutritious food. Modern society has lost its link to the natural ways. Morganic is here to help many people, in a simplistic, common-sense manner. The Nature Beds can be used in a small, inner city environment, or large gardens. Also, when the Nature Beds are manufactured, there will be a ‘How-to’ series on YouTube, explaining the design, construction and maintenance of your Morganic Garden, with ease. As we say:</p>

<p>Our website, <a href=""http://morganicgardens.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">morganicgardens.com</a>, will have an application where you’ll be able to upload the current design of your house and garden, overlay a hexagonal layout to scale, choose the path width, and then click-and-drag a certain use for each hexagon. You will be able to design your Morganic Garden online, and then on the lower right of the screen, the Shopping Cart adds up the cost of the order. Another benefit of the Morganic Gardens system is the ability to stage the construction. This means you can have an overall design, but only build part. When funds or time allow, you can continue with your initial design. NB: there will be an option to have Morganic Gardens to check the design, for your peace-of-mind. </p>

Automatically companion plants (which help with pests and diseases) will be included into the design, then check your seed quantities, and order more if needed. Further to this, we will have a children's art design section, where children can type in their favourite vegetables, and then do funky designs, (where parents can add a few other vegetables if needed) the companion plants will be included, and the design can be planted out, so your children can aid in bringing their ‘living artwork’ into fruition. </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Another option for the Nature Bed Vege Gardens is the Crystal Gardens. In these designs you can choose a favourite crystal, and the inner geometries of that crystal will be placed into the hexagonal Nature Bed.  You choose the climate, the season, and different plants can be added to your Crystal Garden. There will also be Morganic Crystal Essences which can be purchased as to aid the connection to that specific crystal that you have chosen in the design. This strongly links one to the mineral kingdom, and the plant kingdom.</p>

<br/><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Where We Are Going</b><br/></p>
<p>As a society I, and many others, sense great risk in the way we live our lives, especially in the so-called ‘First World!’ Great changes are needed and usually evolve through chaos; let’s nip issues in the bud now, so there’ll be less chaos. Let’s join together, grow food, and share the abundance that nature nurtures us with. Let’s re-unite families, friends, neighbours, and make the change. </p>
<p>As Gandhi so eloquently put, ‘You must be the change that you wish to see in the world!’ </p>
<p>For those who the Morganic Garden Designs won’t work for, then please share this Campaign, because one of your friends may be interested. You can do this on the below - Indiegogo share tool. </p>
<p>When our ‘How-to’ series is uploaded, communities can use that information to lead toward self-sufficiency. We’re in this world together and, from every aspect in the way I see life, we’d be better off growing our own food. This will be at odds with corporate greed, which I’m comfortable with. </p>
<p>All problems have an answer which our environment is constantly teaching us. If we simply allow nature to fill in the needs we have, we can work a system which is beneficial to all. </p>
<p>Please place a seed in the ground as often as you can, and allow nature to nurture you. </p>

Another benefit of the Morganic Gardens system is the ability to stage the construction. This means you can have an overall design, but only build part. When funds or time allow, you can continue with your initial design. NB: there will be an option to have Morganic Gardens to check the design, for your peace-of-mind. 
Another design on morganicgardens.com will be for the individual Nature Bed Vege Gardens where you can design your vegetable garden plantings. Automatically companion plants (which help with pests and diseases) will be included into the design, then check your seed quantities, and order more if needed. Further to this, we will have a children's art design section, where children can type in their favourite vegetables, and then do funky designs, (where parents can add a few other vegetables if needed) the companion plants will be included, and the design can be planted out, so your children can aid in bringing their ‘living artwork’ into fruition. 

Another option for the Nature Bed Vege Gardens is the Crystal Gardens. In these designs you can choose a favourite crystal, and the inner geometries of that crystal will be placed into the hexagonal Nature Bed.  You choose the climate, the season, and different plants can be added to your Crystal Garden. There will also be Morganic Crystal Essences which can be purchased as to aid the connection to that specific crystal that you have chosen in the design. This strongly links one to the mineral kingdom, and the plant kingdom.



Where We Are Going
As a society I, and many others, sense great risk in the way we live our lives, especially in the so-called ‘First World!’ Great changes are needed and usually evolve through chaos; let’s nip issues in the bud now, so there’ll be less chaos. Let’s join together, grow food, and share the abundance that nature nurtures us with. Let’s re-unite families, friends, neighbours, and make the change. 
As Gandhi so eloquently put, ‘You must be the change that you wish to see in the world!’ 
For those who the Morganic Garden Designs won’t work for, then please share this Campaign, because one of your friends may be interested. You can do this on the below - Indiegogo share tool. 
When our ‘How-to’ series is uploaded, communities can use that information to lead toward self-sufficiency. We’re in this world together and, from every aspect in the way I see life, we’d be better off growing our own food. This will be at odds with corporate greed, which I’m comfortable with. 
All problems have an answer which our environment is constantly teaching us. If we simply allow nature to fill in the needs we have, we can work a system which is beneficial to all. 
Please place a seed in the ground as often as you can, and allow nature to nurture you. 

‘Five days to construct, five hours per week, food for life!’

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>It
has been estimated that one out of every three bites of food that you eat comes
from a plant, vegetable, fruit, nut, or seed that ultimately relies on the role
of bees in the ecosystem. </p>
<p>Between
2007 and 2013, more than 10 million beehives were lost in the United States,
which is twice the normal rate of loss. This loss can be attributed to Colony Collapse
Disorder (CCD), a phenomenon that has eluded scientists for years. Currently,
we are on track for a complete wipeout of bees in the United States. </p>
<p>The
money raised will go to the development of a bee sanctuary in Floyd, Virginia. The
sanctuary will be established over seven (7) acres of donated land for the sanctuary
and research center. The research center will be partnered with a satellite
location at Whitebarrel Winery in Christiansburg, VA. With your help we will be
able to accomplish three major goals:</p>
<p><span>(1)<span>  </span></span>Create a seven (7) acre bee sanctuary with the optimal
placement of a minimum of 50 beehives through pasture and woodland.</p>
<p><span>(2)<span>  </span></span>Establish a research center for surrounding universities to
study CCD, novel antimicrobial compounds to combat the spread of antibiotic
resistance, and other bee research of high impact for science and the

and education seminars, training sessions, and ‘farm-days’ where we will

events and bee-festivals </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Starting a bee sanctuary is by no means cheap! In fact, each
hive cost approximately $1000 to establish, including all equipment and bees. This
does not include the costs of maintaining the beehives, man-power, or the
planting of bee-friendly, pollen- and nectar-rich trees and wildflowers. The
funds raised through your generous support will be used for the following:</p>

donors. We are just $2.21 shy of the amount needed for the gazebo and stream creation.  All additional funds that come in beyond the goal will be used in their entirety to create the therapeutic garden/ healing forest in the area surrounding the stream and gazebo and sacred sites beyond.  Please contribute now to make this healing forest/ spirit garden a beauty.
The Sacred Spirals Spiritual Community contributed to this Campaign.  Please all Blue Star Circles, Venus Rising Congregations, Shamanic Ministers, and Shamanic Breathwork Facilitators,  follow Sacred Spirals lead;  contribute to create this therapeutic garden that will increase the rate and efficacy of healing for all those who experience it.
Here are the details 


What does the $18,900 fund? The earth moving that will take the pond dam soil to fill in the edge of the
     pond and fashion the stream bank.  Rocks will line the 2 springs and the waterway that flow into the area. The waterline crossing the dam will be re-run to fit it within the new soil line of the area.  Large boulders will be staged to create
     spillways and sound effects in the stream.  A gazebo will span the stream. 
There
     are numerous perks for different donation levels.
Any money that comes in above and beyond the original $18,900 goal will be used to create walkways, seating areas, and gardens surrounding the new stream and gazebo..

The creation of the stream at Isis Cove will add to the allure and healing that attracts people here to do their deep inner work and find healing on all levels: 

Creating
     a beautiful riparian garden that helps draw
     people here and aids in their healing will enhance the speed of recovery from physical, emotional and spiritual ills.
  It
     is through the cathartic healing work done at this cove, that people release aggression, relax racial, political, gender, and spiritual
     prejudices, become global citizens, and develop ecological sensitivity for the Earth.  


My love
     of the earth and innate skill in horticulture has led to more than 30 years of manifesting beautiful gardens and
     renovating areas to create greater  functionality and beauty.  Please join me in recreating this
     healing space, to make it a beacon to those seeking healing.
All
     donations to the Go with the Flow Campaign will be used entirely
     for the conversion of the pond to stream, gazebo and surrounding gardens and hardscapes.  None of
     the funds will go toward salaries or bonuses for Robert or myself.


Risks & Challenges
The start time must be delayed as the total funds accumulated too late to start the project before the Spring workshop push. The area will remain under construction during the very busy spring months when the cove is visited by the highest numbers of people.
Isis Cove has been a place for trans-formative healing
for many people over the years.    Please support this fundraising campaign
and help make the center of this healing community look lovely and feel fantastic.  
More than money will help with this
campaign.  Below are additional ways you can contribute: 

Please
     spread the word to your friends, family and neighbors about Going
     with the Flow fundraising campaign for Illuminated Heart Center of Venus Rising at Isis Cove. 
Please share this campaign with 5(or more ;) people.
After the land construction is
     complete, plants will be needed for this project.  Some of the plants that we need to grace this area are: Blue or purple Iris ensata – Japanese
     Iris, Thelypteris normalis –Southern
     Shield Fern, Rhododendrons, Native Azaleas, or other leafy ones you would like to contribute to this new garden, please do.   Mulch and wildflower seed will also be needed once the project is complete.  Stain will be needed for the Gazebo.  Additionally, we hope to grace the area with river rocks, wind chimes, bird houses, flag stones, etc.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Can an App Start a Revolution?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why an APW App?</strong></p>
<p>In 2012 the concept for starting AParallelWorld.com didn’t seem controversial. In fact, at that time it seemed obvious that providing current facts and real news about sustainable living was a good thing. The APW team wasn’t trying to start a revolution. To us, it seemed a “no brainer.” What average American wouldn’t appreciate a one-stop website that provided a clear path to a healthier, more affordable, greener lifestyle?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And so, we built the APW site to do just that. As a result, thousands of you have become part of the APW family because you’re eager to learn as much as you can about saving money while helping to care for Mother Earth. You’ve learned to rely on APW to spread the news about alternatives that don’t fit the fossil-fueled corporate narrative. Many of you now take advantage of the APW site to find information, bonuses and discounts from our green vendors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In starting this project, we never dreamed that providing honest facts about sustainable living might be considered revolutionary. But that was before Trump and his minions came into power. That was before the 45th president installed climate-change deniers as heads of the very institutions created to protect our environment. As a result, a goodly portion of the Right Wing sees America’s desire for “sustainability” as an existential threat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Revolution on Your Smart Phone</strong></p>
<p>Truth be told, you might think your life was threatened too, if you believe it depends on America staying addicted — addicted to oil, gasoline, toxic products, too-big-to-fail-banks, GMOs, and a corporate-controlled Mainstream Media. Like you, our APW team members are fed up with these mega corporations controlling our lives as well as our government. The moment for an economic revolution has arrived and true to the times it’s coming as an app.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>APW’s job is to tell you about affordable alternatives that are better for you and the planet. APW works hard shouting out the message about the healthier, cleaner, better-for-local-economies alternatives that are available today. However, given today’s grim political reality, the team now believes we need to reach more people quicker than ever. We believe that “sustainably” is patriotic because it helps move the center of political balance back to regular Americans like us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>First the Video…</strong></p>
<p>Our first effort to spread the APW message as far and as fast as we could was to create this 2-minute video, “Jumping the Track from Corporate Control to Economic Democracy”. Within two days after its launch early this year the APW site came under a blistering cyber attack by fossil fuel trolls and bots with Russian addresses. Although that attack hurt the launch of the video we didn’t give up. We rebuilt our security and re-launched it. As of now over 350,000 (and counting) people have watched it on Facebook alone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>…Then the App</strong></p>
<p>People are beginning to wake up and realize that if they want their kids to have any kind of a livable planet they need to act now. It’s time to stop supporting dirty industries that buy our government. It’s time to make the APW strategy available to everyone who’s ready to shake off the 19th century technologies still holding power over our everyday lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every time you use the APW App you’ll be conducting your own little “media revolt.” All three applications from the APW website will be at your fingertips. Users will receive a weekly update every Thursday from APW’s writers and editors. You’ll have access to the Parallel Strategy, showing you how to live healthy, save money and start to protect the planet. And you’ll have access to APW’s exclusive marketplace and the bonuses and discounts offered by our green vendors.</p>

<h3><b>Short Summary</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><i>My name
is SuZen, and I’m a NYC designer and <i>photographer</i>. I am thrilled to share my newest creation, the <b>JacCAT</b>™.  Inspired by my feline friends, t<i>he <b>JacCAT</b>™ is the purrrfect synthesis of all the things I love – photography, design, cats and fashion. </i></i></p>
<p><b>JacCAT</b>’s unique design<b> </b>features a large, bold silhouette of a black
cat fastened with 3 magnets. It's made from 100%
imported cotton from Japan and manufactured of the highest quality in the New York City's garment district. <i><b>JacCAT is truly the Cat’s Meow!</b></i></p>
<p><i><i><i>Here's </i>actress, comedian, author, <b>Annabelle Gurwitch, </b>modeling the<b> JacCAT</b><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">. </b></i><br/></i></p>

</div><div><i><i>Three of my loves—cats, photography, and design—came together first in my 1990 book, ""The Love Story of Sushi and Sashimi, A Cat Tale,"" published by Capra Press. Since then, I added fashion, producing lines of clothing, scarves, bags and notecards, which are sold in fine boutiques throughout the country.</i></i></div><div>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466863543/mural_by_SuZen_ccv0xg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Over the years, I’ve exhibited my photography internationally in museums and galleries and multi-media installations in many public spaces, such as JFK Airport, World Trade Center, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal. </div><div>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p>The basic costs of bringing this product to market are about $10,000.00.
The complicated process of manufacturing clothing calls for many services and
purchases upfront. More cash on hand makes it possible to buy materials and do
production in quantity, lowering the cost of goods sold. Before the first JacCAT™
can be assembled, there are many expenses, such as the design and manufacturing of numerous samples, labels and care tags that go in each jacket. Pattern makers need to grade
the design for sizes, and then highly skilled cutters will turn bolts of fabric
into the pieces that will be sewn together by workers in a factory located in the heart of the NYC garment district.</p>
<p>Once the product exists, marketing requires many other expenses.
Just a few of them are printing and distributing promotional
materials, and reserving spaces at events like CatCon and traveling to work the
shows. And as anyone who produces unique products can tell you, there are also
costs in advance of everything—to trademark, license, and protect original creations.
The difference between success and failure often depends on the size of your
advertising budget. The more cash there is on hand, the greater the potential
for ultimate success. </p>
<p><i>
</i></p>
<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<i>
</i><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When you support the
JacCAT™ project, you are backing entrepreneurship, work for Americans, an
independent artist/designer, and care for cats without homes—and you’re
facilitating a product that will be attractive to buyers who love cats.</p>
<p>The world is full of
people who adore cats, as the Internet makes clear. The JacCAT™ is my most
recent design in a series of products that appeal to cat lovers everywhere,
which began with the CatWrap™, a sleek bodysuit patented and produced in the
‘90s.</p>
<p>Corporate manufacturers
have deep pockets, but they will make their products cheaply in third world
countries to increase their profit margins, unconcerned about job loss at home.
This project is a small step towards keeping jobs in America, and the creation
of something affordable that combines art and function for an enthusiastic
demographic of Cat Lovers.</p>
<p>I have been making art,
designing, and producing products for over 30 years. As the costs of living,
production, and marketing have escalated in recent years, it has become harder
to implement a project without investor support. Campaigns like this enable
supporters to decide what gets to market, giving donors a chance to affect
consumer options.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p><i>
</i></p>
<p>There are
always risks when you launch a product, although clever marketing and targeting
the right demographics reduce the risks inherent in production. While it may be
harder to wholesale the JacCAT™ to retail stores, which need to triple or
quadruple the price to cover their own operating expenses, the risks are minimized
when using direct marketing through cat conventions, an online store, or
advertising in cat-related publications. The more we can raise for an
advertising campaign, the fewer the risks.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>Some of
you might not have money to spare, but you can still make an important

Short Summary

My name
is SuZen, and I’m a NYC designer and photographer. I am thrilled to share my newest creation, the JacCAT™.  Inspired by my feline friends, the JacCAT™ is the purrrfect synthesis of all the things I love – photography, design, cats and fashion. 
JacCAT’s unique design features a large, bold silhouette of a black
cat fastened with 3 magnets. It's made from 100%
imported cotton from Japan and manufactured of the highest quality in the New York City's garment district. JacCAT is truly the Cat’s Meow!
Here's actress, comedian, author, Annabelle Gurwitch, modeling the JacCAT. 


Here's the JacCAT in Red & Black - great for the holidays!


Three of my loves—cats, photography, and design—came together first in my 1990 book, ""The Love Story of Sushi and Sashimi, A Cat Tale,"" published by Capra Press. Since then, I added fashion, producing lines of clothing, scarves, bags and notecards, which are sold in fine boutiques throughout the country.
Many New Yorkers know my work, as my photograph, ""Flowing Light"", is a 40’ x 25’ painted mural in Times Square, funded by the NYSCA. 
Over the years, I’ve exhibited my photography internationally in museums and galleries and multi-media installations in many public spaces, such as JFK Airport, World Trade Center, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal. 
   What We Need & What You Get 




The basic costs of bringing this product to market are about $10,000.00.
The complicated process of manufacturing clothing calls for many services and
purchases upfront. More cash on hand makes it possible to buy materials and do
production in quantity, lowering the cost of goods sold. Before the first JacCAT™
can be assembled, there are many expenses, such as the design and manufacturing of numerous samples, labels and care tags that go in each jacket. Pattern makers need to grade
the design for sizes, and then highly skilled cutters will turn bolts of fabric
into the pieces that will be sewn together by workers in a factory located in the heart of the NYC garment district.
Once the product exists, marketing requires many other expenses.
Just a few of them are printing and distributing promotional
materials, and reserving spaces at events like CatCon and traveling to work the
shows. And as anyone who produces unique products can tell you, there are also
costs in advance of everything—to trademark, license, and protect original creations.
The difference between success and failure often depends on the size of your
advertising budget. The more cash there is on hand, the greater the potential
for ultimate success. 


    The Impact 



When you support the
JacCAT™ project, you are backing entrepreneurship, work for Americans, an
independent artist/designer, and care for cats without homes—and you’re
facilitating a product that will be attractive to buyers who love cats.
The world is full of
people who adore cats, as the Internet makes clear. The JacCAT™ is my most
recent design in a series of products that appeal to cat lovers everywhere,
which began with the CatWrap™, a sleek bodysuit patented and produced in the
‘90s.
Corporate manufacturers
have deep pockets, but they will make their products cheaply in third world
countries to increase their profit margins, unconcerned about job loss at home.
This project is a small step towards keeping jobs in America, and the creation
of something affordable that combines art and function for an enthusiastic
demographic of Cat Lovers.
I have been making art,
designing, and producing products for over 30 years. As the costs of living,
production, and marketing have escalated in recent years, it has become harder
to implement a project without investor support. Campaigns like this enable
supporters to decide what gets to market, giving donors a chance to affect
consumer options.
   Risks & Challenges  


There are
always risks when you launch a product, although clever marketing and targeting
the right demographics reduce the risks inherent in production. While it may be
harder to wholesale the JacCAT™ to retail stores, which need to triple or
quadruple the price to cover their own operating expenses, the risks are minimized
when using direct marketing through cat conventions, an online store, or
advertising in cat-related publications. The more we can raise for an
advertising campaign, the fewer the risks.   Other Ways You Can Help

Introduction

My name is Larry and Recycling is a huge part of protecting the environment for me and my family, and I have been doing this for almost 15 years. Here's what we do.

The old recycle truck we have now, collects recycling going door to door.
Then we donate the stuff to a local Recycle Depot...about one ton/week

Today we have about 370 subscribers to our Curbside Service in Camrose representing about 3000 residents.

Last year we eliminated over 150 Tons of GreenHouse Gases by collecting recycling
There is no public transportation and 7259 dwellings in Camrose.
Recently, we learned that France is already doing this in 60 cities and towns.We want more people to recycle and they say the #1 way to reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions is Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. My campaign is very important to us because it will eliminate even more GHGs produced by waste collection trucks and even more from costly road maintenence. By using Draft Horses to pick-up recycling instead of a truck, it will eliminate more than 14 Tons of GreenHouse Gases annually and get even more people to recycle. The horses are very much like people so, the health and safety of these animals is our highest priority. 


It is a win/win situation!


This is an opportunity for you to help create a cleaner, quieter, more natural environment for us all to live in and reduce our carbon footprint, Let's make a more sustainable, smart way of collecting waste for the world! 


How We Got Started
We came up with this idea in January 2014 and so far, we have invested our own money and bought four Draft Horses. These horses were bred for working and they will work for us in teams of two. They never have to work two days in a row and of course...we have special bags to be hung under their tails so they don't poop on the road. 


Trishaly, our team leader, travelled and trained with Alvin Yoder at the Beginner's Horsemanship School in the Amish Hills of Ohio last year. Countless hours have been poured into practice and training for driver and horses, and we are quite serious about reaching our goal. Trish is with the horses every day! Awesome


What We Still Have to Get

In order to make the transition from an ordinary recycling company to an extraordinary method of collection, we have to invest in some more stuff. We can also do this ourselves, however it would take us years rather than months, without your help. We want to eliminate our GHGs immediately!


A sum of $50,000 is still required to fulfill the rest of our requirements, so that we can collect recycling using Horse and Wagon. These items are;


electric Utility Terrain Vehicle-$10,000

custom light weight wagons (state of the art)-$20,000
horse harness used-$5,000
horse trailer used-$5,000

carriage used-$10,000







Perks and Goodies
Horses, horses, horses!!! We have some pretty cool perks to offer our supporters that are very unique. From an awesome picture of our beautiful Clydesdale Teams, to complete instruction and support to start your own horse drawn recycling business for your own community. If this campaign does not reach our goal, all funds we do get, will go towards the purchase of the equipment. The perks we have will be honored as soon we reach our goal. 

This campaign is so important to us because we have been planning it for some time and we have the persistence and determination to make it happen. We have committed to our goal because our environment has to be sustainable, if we want to be healthy for years to come!  
Every person that we have told about this idea, usually says ""that is sooooo cool""! 
We have not had a single negative reaction from our surveys, so we are confident that this is going to work from a business standpoint. We have never been involved with a business idea that has had this kind of public support.
Why this Campaign?
Remember, this campaign is not just about reducing GHG emissions...we are already a recycling company. have operated since 2002, and save over 260 Tons of recycling from ending up in the landfill annually! 
There is not much money made by recyclers yet and I ask you to keep in mind, we know many more people will want to recycle, if they can have their recycling picked up by horse and wagon. GHGs will also be eliminated when fewer people drive their vehicles to the depot with their recycling.

An average vehicle with a 3-litre engine idling for ten minutes burns 300 millilitres (over 1 cup) of fuel and this produces 690 grams of CO2. This may not sound like a lot but remember‚ millions of motorists have fallen into the trap of unnecessary idling. 

About 4.4 Tonnes of GHGs are emitted every 10 minutes when everyone's car is running in Camrose.

<h3>Why the world needs the Mauli Ola Festival</h3>
<p>When it comes to coffee, agriculture, and our relationship with the earth, it's easy to become disconnected. It's easy to not remember the people who farm that coffee, to not worry about whether they are treated well or paid fairly. It's easy to forget that our actions - and our inaction - have an impact on the earth and our communities.</p>
<p>The Mauli Ola Festival is about reconnecting with those values. We will bring together a global tribe to celebrate, teach and start new dialogues about many aspects of the world around us. So far the festival will include: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Coffee and Human Rights Circle </strong>-<p>Prominent presenters Sunalini Menon of CoffeeLab, Sarah Allen of Barista Magazine, Sarah Grant of USC Fullerton, and more will be sharing their work in the nuts and bolts of women's empowerment, economic empowerment and other aspects of human rights in coffee. Using the framework developed by Monica Sharma, senior staff at the United Nations, to develop Leadership for Community Transformation, participants will relate the conversation at the event with their own projects and passions at home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Land-Based Skill Workshops </strong>- Learn about permaculture, natural building, Leave No Trace ethics, fermented foods, biodiesel and more. </li>
<li>
<strong>Traditional Ceremonies -</strong> We will have a Sufi Coffee Ceremony celebrated at the festival.</li>
<li>
<strong>Live music and dance -</strong> A great program of musicians is in store, including <a href=""http://malianofficial.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Malian</a>, Grammy nominated Senegalese West African Kora player <a href=""https://myspace.com/youssouphasidibe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Youssoupha Sidibe</a>, Hawai`ian music from <a href=""http://www.jeffpetersonguitar.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jeff Peterson</a>, a Brazilian zouk workshop and performance by <a href=""http://www.tangerinedance.com/AboutMarie.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marie Alonzo Snyder</a> and more!</li>
<li>
<strong>Great food (and of course, award-winning ethical coffee!)</strong> available from local vendors</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What we're trying to accomplish. </h3>
<p><strong>Everybody feels like the world is going crazy and it is time to return to basic goodness and a sense of human decency.</strong></p>
<p>We have to start with nature when we want to build a future that is sustainable, whether it’s human nature or the weather or the earth.</p>
<p><strong>Remember how precious and valuable joy and laughter are?</strong></p>
<p>Our festival team is working to establish a sacred global culture of peace, harmony, love, and happiness for all.</p>
<p>Mauli Ola Festival is a joyful festival celebrating ecology, healing energy, the arts – and of course, farming. Earth-based wisdom keepers, builders, healers and leaders like Youssoupha Sidibe, Holly Baade, Bonzai Holmes, Jasmine Silverstein, Molly Masaoka, Momi Aiu, and Adam Junod will come together and co-create an expression of collective artistry and beauty.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you so very much for coming to the rescue of all that makes life beautiful!  </strong></p>
<p><i>A portion of the festival's profits will be donated to <a href=""http://kauspecialtycoffee.com/i-ola-na-aina-momona/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">I Ola Na Aina Momona</a> and the <a href=""http://centerforsacredstudies.org/unity-concert/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Black Hills Unity Concert</a>. </i></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why Pahala?</h3>
<p>Pahala is right in the middle of Hawai'i Island's Ka`u District.  Ka`u is home to the newest coffee growing region on the island.  Between 2007 and 2012, Ka`u coffee farmers won eight individual Coffee of the Year Awards from the SCAA.  Widely recognized for quality, Ka`u coffee was first planted by sugar workers left without livelihoods when the sugar plantation closed down in 1997.  In the last twenty years, these amazing people have invested their capital, their labor and their hearts in this land and in the coffee they produce.  A selection of small lot coffees from these farmers will be just one of the many delights to experience at the Mauli Ola Festival.</p>
<p>Our Coffee and Human Rights Circle will give needed attention to the coffee industry.  More and more cafe owners, importers and growers are developing relationships and conversations about improving human rights in coffee.</p>
<p>Our Coffee and Human Rights Circle intends to ground these heroic efforts in a conversation about structural change, that will institutionalize this commitment to human rights as an enduring shift in the way the world works.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Here are some of our key challenges:</p>
<p><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> As this is the first year of our festival, our biggest investment will be people's time. We will invest the proceeds from our funding to pay the festival organizers, to set up the infrastructure of the event and to help offset the costs of lodging for our speakers. </p>
<p><strong>Recognition:</strong> As a new festival, one of our biggest objectives will be to educate the public about what we are doing and to get our name out there. Being funded will certainly help, as we will need to advertise in addition to our PR media outreach. </p>

<h4>Dependability</h4>
<p>Our product carries the most secure, bankable warranty of any Minnesota manufacturer. Every panel sold includes our triple-backed warranty:</p>
<ul>
<li>12-year product warranty to cover workmanship and product quality</li>
<li>25-year linear performance warranty with no sharp declines</li>
<li>Added 3rd-party protection, so you're covered no matter what</li>

<h4>On-Time Delivery</h4>
<p>Delivering product on-time is a huge problem in the solar industry. Part of the issue is that installers don't want to ask for product until they're sure they have available capital.

We wake up every day thinking about how we can use solar to make a positive impact. It is literally in our business plan.
How Your Funds Will Help

The first $50,000: Enable Us to Hire Disabled Workers

The
first portion of our funding would go directly towards refitting our
manufacturing line to be completely accessible, so we can hire disabled
workers. This would entail lift assist equipment
for solar panels, wheelchair ramps and platforms at workstations, slide
stations to accommodate proper ergonomics during the manufacturing process, and
other specialized equipment. As a veteran and former Registered Nurse,
our founder R. Marie Zola has a great deal of passion for building a welcoming
and accessible work environment.

the whole production cycle: the energy involved in the extraction of the virgin
materials, the processing of these materials, manufacturing and transportation,
would imply that the renewable energy invested in these materials is destroyed
in an incinerator or deposited in a landfill, ultimately going to waste.
Recycled materials, on the other hand, will prevent energy consumption done in

of fracking methods and various other new technologies have enabled crude oil
production to sky-rocket.  This sudden
ramp-up in production means more crude oil must be transported to the
refineries over existing infrastructure – primarily through rail car and
trucking transportation channels. As the volume of crude oil transported over
rail cars increases, the number of rail car accidents also increase

We found a way to reduce the risk of Crude Oil Train Accidents
that put the Safety of Citizens and the surrounding Environment in Jeopardy.
Oil & Gas production has been rapidly expanding in the United
  States over the last 10 years. The introduction
of fracking methods and various other new technologies have enabled crude oil
production to sky-rocket.  This sudden
ramp-up in production means more crude oil must be transported to the
refineries over existing infrastructure – primarily through rail car and
trucking transportation channels. As the volume of crude oil transported over
rail cars increases, the number of rail car accidents also increase
proportionally making the amount of crude oil gallons spilled a frightening
dilemma with catastrophic results. 
There are approximately 150,000 DOT 111 tank cars currently
in operation today. These tank cars have proven to be a weak link in the crude
oil transportation process.  Intense
regulatory pressure has been mounting to have these tank cars modified and
ultimately replaced. Currently more than one million barrels
of oil are transported by train across the United States every day. The volume of oil shipped by rail has increased 50-fold
in just 5 years. Even though the Oil & Gas industry is
currently in decline, most experts expect a recovery that will cause a rapid
surge of production and transport in the next 12 to 24 months. This sudden
surge will overwhelm the rail car transport system and we will experience a
very aggressive “hockey-stick” increase in devastating rail car accidents.

breach in this tank STILL risks the entire payload as well as endangers the
communities and environments nearby!    What We Need & What You Get


We need $40,000.00 to cover the COST to PATENT the Honeycomb Cargo design.
We developed a revolutionary design that will significantly decrease the risk of oil train explosions.
This funding will support the long and grueling patent process that will enable prototype construction and 3rd party testing to meet stringent regulations for transport of hazmat and other volatile organic compounds.  We will apply all funds to the continuation of our campaign to save the communities and the environment along the railways that will be impacted by oil train rail car disasters.    The Impact

This innovative solution will face many obstacles and will require adoption by the railroad and oil industries as well as the U.S. DOT. We have approached the U.S. DOT, several U.S. Senators and some of the more vocal local governments along the rail ways asking for their support and guidance.
We are also engaging the rail car manufacturers and the oil & gas exploration & production companies to show them our design and how much money they will save by deploying this solution.     Other Ways You Can Help

<p><br/></p> <p>Hello, everyone. My name is Aleksi Baznekian F. L. S. I am a fellow of The Linnean Society of London, and  I am an American-Armenian biologist/botanist with an AA degree in biological sciences form Glendale Community College (<i>cum laude</i>), and a BA degree in biology (<i>magna cum laude</i>) from California State University, Northridge. After graduation, I received a grant and designed a new herbarium (Joseph Keefe Herbarium) for Glendale Community College (above right image; photo by Bryce Luna). See the link below for more info:<br/></p>

<p>Currently, I am exclusively curating a <i>Eucalyptus </i>collection at the UCLA Herbarium. In addition, I am writing an identification guide/manual (e-book) that will facilitates identification of native, naturalized and some cultivated eudicot flora found in Los Angeles County. On the side, I publish articles about botanical phenomenon that I encounter in the field. Two of these articles can be accessed by clicking on the links below:</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While studying plants in Malibu, CA, I came across a plane/sycamore tree (genus <i>Platanus</i>) that appears to be morphologically (mainly the leaves; above left image; photo by Aleksi Baznekian) different from our native species,<i> P. racemosa</i>. The individual is located in an untouched natural area near Zuma Canyon. Street planted London plane trees (<i>P. x hispanica</i>) were observed in the vicinity, but they are of the 3-lobed leaf cultivars. Recent molecular work has established that, at least in North CA, there is gene flow between <i>P. x hispanica</i> and <i>P. racemosa </i>(Lang, 2011). This article can be reached by accessing the link below:<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lang, Kylene R. ""Microsatellite development in <i>Plantanus</i> for documenting gene flow among species."" MS thesis.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Leaf morphology and infructescence numbers rule out the individual from being <i>P. occidentalis</i> (rarely cultivated in CA). It also rules out a pure <i>P. x hispanica</i> (since this species has been reported to have 2-3 infructescences). This individual has 5 infructescences per inflorescence. This leaves three possibilities: this individual may be <i>P. orientalis</i> (this species is not usually cultivated in CA, but it is found in arboreta and birds often feed on their fruits, and defecate them in natural areas), a hybrid between <i>P. x hispanica</i> and <i>P. racemosa</i>, or an unreported variety of <i>P. racemosa</i>. There is a fourth and rare possibility that this individual is <i>P. x hispanica</i> 'Columbia,' which has distinct 5-lobed leaves, but like the other cultivars of <i>P. x hispanica</i>, this cultivar is reported to have 2-3 infructescences, which is not the case with the observed unknown individual. See the link below for a herbarium voucher of this cultivar:<br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""> My first question is that what is the parentage of this individual? My second questions is that if this individual is <i>P. orientalis</i>, or a pure species of <i>P. x hispanica</i>, is their gene flow between itself and near by <i>P.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">         Your contributions will go towards answering these questions. I will gather specimen samples, send them to the required laboratories, gather and interpret the data and ultimately make conclusions accordingly. In addition, and more importantly, your funds will support a university graduate, such as I, with a BA degree, to have the opportunity to carryout such a research! It is truly sad that these days, not only do university graduates work for minimum wage, but they also work menial jobs, where they NEVER get the chance to apply their knowledge, explore, discover and write, and eventually add their findings to the existing body of knowledge in their own respective fields. Even worse is the fact that such opportunities are now only available for people going for their MS or Ph. D. degrees! This shouldn't be the case. This is the greater idea behind this project. Your funds will not only ensure the discovery of the origins of this <i>Platanus</i> individual and any possible gene flow between itself and native <i>P. racemosa</i> individuals, but that they support the idea that willing and able university graduates, who are unable to attend graduate school, whether by choice or hardship or both, can have the opportunity to apply their skills and add to human/public knowledge, instead of saying, ""Do you want fries with that?""

This program allowed me to gain valuable experience that I'll need while pursuing a career in shark research and conservation. However, two self-funded volunteer trips and one undergrad degree later and you can only begin to imagine the debt I'm currently in. My next adventure is taking me to Sint Maarten where I'll be volunteering my time at a local dive shop, and in exchange earn my dive master certification. This certification will further my diving skills and allow me to help others interact with the animals I love in their natural environment. I have started this campaign in order to raise money to help me pay for any living and added diving expenses while in Sint Maarten. My goal is to use my future dive master certification in combination with my degree in marine biology to conduct shark research and work towards improving the conservation efforts for these incredible and misunderstood animals.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>• They never have and never will buy land. Instead they help the local communities take legal control of their forest.<br/>• By building better schools, better clinics and better incomes, they ensure rainforest protection goes hand in hand with better lives.<br/>• They focus their efforts on rainforest that is most at-risk and which would otherwise be destroyed within the next 18 months.<br/>• The protected forest forms a shield to make millions of acres of neighbouring forest inaccessible to loggers.<br/>• They promise that more than 90p in every £1 you donate will go straight to their projects.</div>

Not only is the Mongol Rally an industrial dose of adventure, it’s also about Saving the World. The organizers ask every team to raise a minimum of £1000 for charity, of which at least £500 have to go to their official charity project Cool Earth. 
To date organizers have raised over £5.5 million for charity and, along with the teams on their other adventures, they'll be saving the world one rain forest. Where would we get lost if we didn't have jungles?


As we drive to Mongolia, we want to help an organisation which is acting there. We have chosen Bayasgalant as our second charity project.
100 % of the Money raised  with this homepage will go for charity!


What is Bayasgalant?
Bayasgalant is the Mongolian word for ”happy”. In the widest sense of the word, Bayasgalant Kinderhilfe Mongolei wants to make the kids who live in the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar happy. More specifically it means a lot of support for the children and families.

To reach this aim, Bayasgalant runs a day care centre for the poorest children in one of the poorest areas in the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar. In the day care centre they are educated, fed and it’s a place for them to play and relax.

Bayasgalant wants to improve the future of the children, giving them a perspective and also to support their families to help them to find a way out of the poverty spiral. The main focus is on help to self-help.
Your donation improves the life of the children in Mongolia. When you donate 5 Francs a child gets a hat, scarf and gloves which are necessary during the cold winter months. A school uniform costs 20 Francs, 50 Francs is the amount of food for one child during one month and 100 Francs pays University fees for a semester.Heating costs for the daycare centre are 200 Francs for 2 monthsand 500 Francs is the amount for several medical treatments.

What Is Cool Earth?
Cool Earth saves at-risk rainforest and shields millions of acres of neighbouring forest. They put local people back in control, giving them the resources they need to keep their forest intact.


How they do it
• They never have and never will buy land. Instead they help the local communities take legal control of their forest.• By building better schools, better clinics and better incomes, they ensure rainforest protection goes hand in hand with better lives.• They focus their efforts on rainforest that is most at-risk and which would otherwise be destroyed within the next 18 months.• The protected forest forms a shield to make millions of acres of neighbouring forest inaccessible to loggers.• They promise that more than 90p in every £1 you donate will go straight to their projects.



How to donate: Perks

In order to make the donations more funny and to add challenges to our trip, we set up a few perks (challenges) we will perform for your donation.
Please select the perks on the right side and make us suffer :-)

<p><b>Who we are</b></p>
<p>San Miguel is a beautiful Maya village in
the Toledo District of southern Belize. Ten years ago, myself and other
villagers formed a group focused on protecting the environment around our
village – our rainforest, river and wildlife.</p>
<p>Our group is called C’ac’alenel Car Sa Nima
(CCSN), which means “Riverfish Protectors” in Q’eqchi' Maya. We conserve forests
along the upper Rio Grande River through traditional knowledge and contemporary
activities with a vision that the Rio Grande forest corridor supports
socio-economic, cultural and recreational activities that benefit the residents
of San Miguel.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437682011/bprf235odguwp6r7tdsz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Above: The source of the Rio Grande river a few miles northwest of San Miguel.

<p><br/></p><p>CCSN
has gained the support of farmers along the river not to cut trees within 66
feet of the river. We have created a nature trail through this forest corridor
for villagers and visitors to enjoy. We have planted 2000 trees and taught hundreds
of children and adults about environmental protection through traditional storytelling
and documentary movie nights.</p>
<p>Our
group is going from strength to strength and serving as a model for other
villages. In 2014, CCSN received a license from the Department of Lands and
Surveys to officially manage the river reserve. In May 2015, we collaborated
with the village council to formally designate a community reserve for the
prized rosewood tree. And we recently celebrated our first-ever environmental
week, highlighting the successful community stewardship approach to watershed
management.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437682494/h4pjctlbjhthhk1czpk0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437682547/nds0gviaxkmyewbmu2sr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Above: San Miguel primary school children joining in our reforestation efforts.<p><br/></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our campaign</b><br/></p>
<p>We believe that if we are to conserve and
develop our natural resources sustainably, preserve our cultural identity and
develop our nation meaningfully, we need conscious, educated citizens. That is
the basis of CCSN’s decision to invest in our young villagers’ education through
the CCSN Scholarship Fund.</p>
<p>Most families in San Miguel depend on
subsistence farming – growing just the food they need and trading a little. We
are rich in many ways but not in cash. The cost of high school textbooks and
stationary – about $250 per year – is beyond the means of most families.</p>
<p>Last year, we started
a textbook scholarship program. We managed to obtain funds for textbooks and
school supplies for five first-year high school students (ages 11-12). The
students have all performed well at school, and, in exchange for their
scholarships, completed ten hours of community service, either doing
conservation work or assisting elders in the community.</p>
<p>These five students have now passed on
their books to another five first-formers, and we are seeking funds to purchase
second year textbooks, as well as school supplies for our five second-year
students and five new students.</p>
<p>We are asking you to donate to our cause so that
these promising young people can continue their educations. Each child will
receive $250 worth of books for the upcoming school year. We encourage our students to look after the books, and with any
luck, they will help at least another 50 students over the coming years.</p>
<p>The students will continue to give back
through 10 hours of community service per year, which is helping to mould them into
responsible young individuals.</p>

<p><b>What we need</b></p>
<p>Five sets of textbooks x $250 per set =

<p>Ten sets of stationary (exercise books,

<p>Indiegogo fees @ $160</p>
<p>Total = $1,860.</p>
<p>If we are lucky enough to exceed our
target, we will purchase third-year and fourth-year textbooks, enabling our
students to complete high school.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s no guarantee we can
continue to fund these scholarship places, but with our commitment to our cause
and the generous support of people like you, we believe we can do it. We are
also lucky to benefit from the support of a mentor organisation, the Toledo

<h3>Bref résumé</h3>
<p>La Halte maraîchère est le résultat d'un rêve commun de retour à la terre, de se nourrir sainement et localement. Nous avons fait l'acquisition de notre première terre agricole à Lac-aux-sables dans le but de la cultiver en jardins bio-intensifs de petite surface. Nous désirons également aménager une parcelle de forêt comestible et mettre à l'avant plan la culture des champignons. </p>
<p>Dans le but de minimiser notre impact sur l'environnement, nous avons pris la décision d'effectuer la majorité de nos travaux à la main et d'effectuer une culture écologique sans pesticides. Chez nous, les vers de terre et les micro-organismes du sol seront nos principaux alliés pour une culture saine et foisonnante.</p>
<p>Votre contribution financière est essentielle pour nous permettre de consacrer toute notre énergie à réaliser rapidement notre rêve d'autonomie alimentaire !</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Ce dont nous avons besoin</h3>
<p>Puisque c'est notre première année d'exploitation et que nous commençons presque à zéro.</p>
<p>-Outils de jardinerie : 500$</p>
<p>-Système d'irrigation : 500$<br/></p>
<p>-Matériel pour la culture de champignon : 1000$<br/></p>
<p>-Serres de culture : 1500$</p>
<p>-Rénover l'extérieur du bâtiment principal : 1500$</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<h3>Qui sommes-nous?</h3>Carl-André a complété un bac multidisciplinaire en entrepreneuriat, sociologie et management ainsi qu'une technique en génie mécanique. Après avoir géré différents projets et mentoré des jeunes entrepreneurs, il désire aujourd'hui appliquer ses connaissances et son expérience au profit de sa propre entreprise agricole. Passionné de l'alimentation saine, de permaculture et d'éco-construction depuis des années, il a choisi de s'éduquer lui-même en tentant des expériences potagères sur son balcon de ville et lisant de nombreuses publications.<p>Janie a fait des études collégiales en biologie et en éducation. Naturaliste depuis 3 ans, elle a exploré le monde agricole en vivant sur une terre pendant son enfance et en assistant une agronome dans son travail dans les vergers. Elle est sur le point de compléter un AEC en gestion et service de produits fins à travers lequel elle découvre le monde de la culture et du conditionnement des produits forestiers Québecois (champignons sauvages, plantes comestibles, plantes médicinales, etc.). Dans l'idée de cultiver sa propre terre sur les principes du maraîchage bio-intensif de petite surface, elle a suivi une formation avancée en maraîchage de petite surface au terrain même du jardinier qui a inspiré son rêve : Jean-Martin Fortier de la Grelinette. </p>
</div><div>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>L'impact</h3>
<p>Nous croyons que l'avenir de l'agriculture réside dans la culture locale et respectueuse de l'environnement. La Halte maraîchère veut suivre cette tendance et répondre au besoin grandissant de la population de connaître la provenance de leur nourriture et de manger sainement.</p>
<p>Nous souhaitons servir d'inspiration pour les jeunes de notre génération qui ressentent cette pulsion de retour à la terre. On aimerait faire la démonstration qu'il est possible de rentabiliser une petite surface agricole tout en respectant l'environnement et nos valeurs sociales. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Les acquis</h3>
<p>Nous avons acquis la terre agricole en juin 2015 et avons défriché les espaces réservés aux jardins. Les premiers sentiers parcourant la forêt comestible ont également été aménagés. Le plan d'affaire est en construction. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>D'autres façons d'aider</h3>
<p></p>

</div></div>","Bref résumé
La Halte maraîchère est le résultat d'un rêve commun de retour à la terre, de se nourrir sainement et localement. Nous avons fait l'acquisition de notre première terre agricole à Lac-aux-sables dans le but de la cultiver en jardins bio-intensifs de petite surface. Nous désirons également aménager une parcelle de forêt comestible et mettre à l'avant plan la culture des champignons. 
Dans le but de minimiser notre impact sur l'environnement, nous avons pris la décision d'effectuer la majorité de nos travaux à la main et d'effectuer une culture écologique sans pesticides. Chez nous, les vers de terre et les micro-organismes du sol seront nos principaux alliés pour une culture saine et foisonnante.
Votre contribution financière est essentielle pour nous permettre de consacrer toute notre énergie à réaliser rapidement notre rêve d'autonomie alimentaire !


Ce dont nous avons besoin
Puisque c'est notre première année d'exploitation et que nous commençons presque à zéro.
-Outils de jardinerie : 500$
-Système d'irrigation : 500$
-Matériel pour la culture de champignon : 1000$
-Serres de culture : 1500$
-Rénover l'extérieur du bâtiment principal : 1500$


Qui sommes-nous?Carl-André a complété un bac multidisciplinaire en entrepreneuriat, sociologie et management ainsi qu'une technique en génie mécanique. Après avoir géré différents projets et mentoré des jeunes entrepreneurs, il désire aujourd'hui appliquer ses connaissances et son expérience au profit de sa propre entreprise agricole. Passionné de l'alimentation saine, de permaculture et d'éco-construction depuis des années, il a choisi de s'éduquer lui-même en tentant des expériences potagères sur son balcon de ville et lisant de nombreuses publications.Janie a fait des études collégiales en biologie et en éducation. Naturaliste depuis 3 ans, elle a exploré le monde agricole en vivant sur une terre pendant son enfance et en assistant une agronome dans son travail dans les vergers. Elle est sur le point de compléter un AEC en gestion et service de produits fins à travers lequel elle découvre le monde de la culture et du conditionnement des produits forestiers Québecois (champignons sauvages, plantes comestibles, plantes médicinales, etc.). Dans l'idée de cultiver sa propre terre sur les principes du maraîchage bio-intensif de petite surface, elle a suivi une formation avancée en maraîchage de petite surface au terrain même du jardinier qui a inspiré son rêve : Jean-Martin Fortier de la Grelinette. 





L'impact
Nous croyons que l'avenir de l'agriculture réside dans la culture locale et respectueuse de l'environnement. La Halte maraîchère veut suivre cette tendance et répondre au besoin grandissant de la population de connaître la provenance de leur nourriture et de manger sainement.
Nous souhaitons servir d'inspiration pour les jeunes de notre génération qui ressentent cette pulsion de retour à la terre. On aimerait faire la démonstration qu'il est possible de rentabiliser une petite surface agricole tout en respectant l'environnement et nos valeurs sociales. 




Les acquis
Nous avons acquis la terre agricole en juin 2015 et avons défriché les espaces réservés aux jardins. Les premiers sentiers parcourant la forêt comestible ont également été aménagés. Le plan d'affaire est en construction.

</p><p align=""center""><i>“The production, use and
disposal of synthetic plastic has become one of the most serious environmental
and human health problems facing us today.”</i></p><p>Starting in November
2015, we’re travelling from Cairo to Capetown,
tracking the world’s plastic footprint.<span>  The key purpose of the trip is to find out
more about how plastic gets into the world</span>’s oceans and to reveal
the real impacts it has on people’s lives and the
environment.<span>  We</span>’ll also be looking at
what effective measures can and should be taken to eliminate the problems we
find.<span>  </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>
</b></p><p><b><b>Why this project is important</b></b></p><b>
</b><p>One of the difficulties with responding to the problem
of plastic waste lies in locating responsibility for its impacts. More research
is needed to identify sources and locate areas where policy can have the
greatest impact.</p>
<p>A major concern is that so much plastic waste ends up
in every part of our marine environment, with dramatic concentrations being
found in the five major ocean gyres. The vast majority of what’s found in the sea originates from the <i>land</i> - from sewage, storm drains,
waterways, beach and coastal litter, as well as dumping, industrial activities
and landfill sites. </p>
<p><b>Our Aims</b></p>
<p>We want to keep plastic out of our oceans and
eliminate single-use plastics by 2030. To do this we will come up with long-term, practical
solutions and raise international public awareness and support. </p>
<p>1. Identify the origins of plastic waste on land, in
lakes, rivers and the sea.</p>
<p>2. Classify the types and quantities of the waste
plastics we find.</p>
<p>3. Assess the impact of waste plastics on the
environment, people and animals?</p>
<p>4. Investigate what current policies and waste facilities
are in place?</p>
<p><b>How are we going to do this?</b></p>
<p>We will use visual data surveys, plastic density
sampling and ethnographic studies, organised around: participant observation,
semi-structured interviews, videos, photography and social media.</p>
<p>The collection of plastic data from Africa will allow
us to come up with effective solutions to reduce plastic waste, review the
effectiveness of existing legislation and compare approaches from different
parts of the continent.</p>

<p></p><p></p><p></p></div>","“The production, use and
disposal of synthetic plastic has become one of the most serious environmental
and human health problems facing us today.”Starting in November
2015, we’re travelling from Cairo to Capetown,
tracking the world’s plastic footprint.  The key purpose of the trip is to find out
more about how plastic gets into the world’s oceans and to reveal
the real impacts it has on people’s lives and the
environment.  We’ll also be looking at
what effective measures can and should be taken to eliminate the problems we
find.  


Why this project is important
One of the difficulties with responding to the problem
of plastic waste lies in locating responsibility for its impacts. More research
is needed to identify sources and locate areas where policy can have the
greatest impact.
A major concern is that so much plastic waste ends up
in every part of our marine environment, with dramatic concentrations being
found in the five major ocean gyres. The vast majority of what’s found in the sea originates from the land - from sewage, storm drains,
waterways, beach and coastal litter, as well as dumping, industrial activities
and landfill sites. 
Our Aims
We want to keep plastic out of our oceans and
eliminate single-use plastics by 2030. To do this we will come up with long-term, practical
solutions and raise international public awareness and support. 
1. Identify the origins of plastic waste on land, in
lakes, rivers and the sea.
2. Classify the types and quantities of the waste
plastics we find.
3. Assess the impact of waste plastics on the
environment, people and animals?
4. Investigate what current policies and waste facilities
are in place?
How are we going to do this?
We will use visual data surveys, plastic density
sampling and ethnographic studies, organised around: participant observation,
semi-structured interviews, videos, photography and social media.
The collection of plastic data from Africa will allow
us to come up with effective solutions to reduce plastic waste, review the
effectiveness of existing legislation and compare approaches from different
parts of the continent.

Quantity
Plastic waste
has become one of the fastest growing hazardous waste streams on the planet. 80% of marine plastic waste comes from the land [1] and there are six times more plastic particles than plankton in some parts of our
oceans.[2]
In the North Pacific Gyre this has risen to a staggering 36:1 in a decade.[3]
Toxic Risk
Plastic contains hundreds of highly toxic persistent chemicals, damaging to both human health and the environment. In water, plastic breaks down into micro-plastic particles that act like a sponge. These accumulate other toxins to them to extreme levels that pass up the food chain to contaminate entire ecosystems and the food we are eating.Disposability
Explosive sales in single-use plastics encourage waste on a vast scale. At the heart of the problem is one of plastic’s most valued properties - its durability. Plastics can take a minimum of 500 years to degrade. Ironically, when combined with a throwaway culture, this means that we are using materials that are designed to last, for short-term use.

Recyclability
Most recycled plastics are 'downcycled' or exported,
often illegally, from Europe to Africa and Asia where burning waste in the open air is commonplace. Confusion and malpractice are
not keeping pace with the sheer quantity or mixture of plastic produced,
releasing toxic emissions or dust into the air and soil.

</div>As children, we would have never been allowed to play on used car &amp; truck tires piling up in our local landfills and junkyards. Even 40 years ago they were considered unsafe!

</div></div><div> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><i>By helping to fund this Campaign, we can extend screening to hundreds, even thousands of communities throughout our nation with similar concerns.</i></p>
<p><i>I've been a vocal opponent of Artificial Turf from the beginning because it seems common sense to me (and many others), that using <i>Ground-up Car Tires as playground material may present a real health hazard to our children.</i> Despite our many concerns and questions, Turf Industry Officials, hired Inspectors and Federal &amp; State regulators continue to tout only the benefits of Crumb &amp; Chunk rubber products, a strategy vaguely reminiscent to that of the tobacco industry. </i></p>
<p><i>Other than a few often quoted reports, no conclusive documentation has been provided proving once and for all that every installation of this material is safe for children to play on. </i></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Each day more and more recycled materials are turned into widely used consumer products, often sourced from nations with far greater environmental challenges than we have here in the US. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>It's nearly impossible to test everything that we import unless we work together. </i><br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<div>By taking this first step to identify where the hazards may exist, ordinary people like you and I can make an incredible difference.<br/><br/><i>If we're successful together in assuming this challenge, perhaps someday soon we can apply similar methods with the help of others in nations where impoverished communities struggle everyday to cope with issues of pollution, sanitation, lack of healthy foods &amp; clean water.

</div>
</div><div>
<div>I expect that this project will involve an enormous amount of time and legal &amp; scientific challenges, many no doubt posed by more well funded and influential industry representatives. But, we only need to find a few bad tires in the soccer field to get things cooking, right? So, I'm up for the challenge if you are!</div>
<div>And, while community based volunteer pre-screening of collected Crumb Rubber materials with 3rd party testing may still not provide enough evidence of largess to pose a challenge to the industry, there's no reason not to try.

</div></div>","Is Artificial Turf Safe? Let's find out!
South Hadley is about to build an Artificial Turf field at our High School. I want to be sure our kids will be safe by providing independent 3rd party testing of the Crumb Rubber Infill materials we'll be using. But why stop here? Let's test your town's turf fields also, just to be safe!


So what exactly is this stuff?
Crumb Rubber products are made of Used Tires...which are not just rubber, but nearly 1/2 petroleum by-products, industrial chemicals & road waste!!!  
They can contain metal wire, textile fibers, toxic glues & solvents, and Carbon Black, a material similar to coal dust or diesel soot, and used produce paint & inks. Used tires are often coated with road chemicals like lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, zinc and copper, along with phthalates, poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other volatile organic compounds (VOC's). Plus there's the fertilizers, pesticides, garbage effluents, construction materials and human wastes that are regularly transported along our roads and highways! Totally Gross!!! You and I would never consider putting these toxins in our mouths, right? Why in the world would we let children handle or even breath their fumes? These are dangerous chemicals similar to those found in cigarettes, and they're being thrown into playgrounds and sports fields, potentially predisposing our children to harm and risk of death.We haul and dispose of nearly all our recycle-able mercury light-bulb-and-battery-laden-garbage, processed municipal sewer sludge and septic & porta-potty wastes, by road! Often in leaky vehicles dripping oil, gas & anti-freeze to boot! Yummy!Of the 254 million cars, trucks and motorcycles on our roads, what's the chance that some of these vehicles might pick up some of that ""crap"" and pass it on through the supply chain to our fields & playgrounds? Pretty high...statistically. 



So, How can you help?  By contributing to our campaign, we'll be able to purchase Lead, Heavy Metal & Chemical Toxicity Testing Kits and begin collecting & processing Crumb Rubber samples from around the country!!! We'll post and map our results online for everyone to see. When we discover a potential safety violation we'll notify State & Local Board of Health Officials, EPA Regulators, the Media and YOU! Real Grassroots, Crowd Sourced Environmental Monitoring and Reporting!!! Something ""We the People..."" established our government for in the first place!

What We Need From You & What You Get...
For just $35 and a little volunteer leg-work, you can help us begin the pre-screening process! You'll receive a package in the mail containing:

(6) Sample Collection Containers
(2) Pairs of Nitrile Gloves (for you and a friend)
A return-addressed, postage paid mailer
Detailed instructions on how we'd like you to collect samples
A link to our live database entry form 
News & updates on sampling efforts from around the nation
A copy of our forthcoming  newsletter entitled ""Where the Rubber Meets the Road: Crumb Rubber Infill  and It's Potential Risks, Hazards and Alternatives."" 

Recognition on our Contributors Page, and our sincere thanks and appreciation for helping us determine the truth about Artificial Turf Crumb Rubber Infill



Check out our list of additional Perks along the side of our project description!

As children, we would have never been allowed to play on used car & truck tires piling up in our local landfills and junkyards. Even 40 years ago they were considered unsafe! Sure, our neighborhood had a tire-swing or two...but we never spent more than a few hours each week swinging on them. We were out playing sports on grass fields and yards!!! And when we swung, as you probably remember, we got pretty dirty and smelled like...well, tires!
Publicly available 3rd party research continues to suggest that many of our standardized testing models present overly optimistic low estimates of daily exposure from interaction & ingestion of Crumb Rubber by children   The EPA even admits that, ""given the very limited nature of this study (i.e., limited number of components monitored, samples sites, and samples taken at each site) and the wide diversity of tire crumb material, it is not possible to extend the results beyond the four study sites or to reach any more comprehensive conclusions without the consideration of additional data.""[1] So whether it's four sites or forty, out of more than 11,000+ Crumb Rubber fields & playgrounds, it still seems pretty sketchy! 

Today, Crumb & Chunk Rubber Infill is seeing increasing use in parks, playgrounds, sports fields and homes around the country, despite mounting concerns from parent groups and community health officials. Nearly every day stories are aired on the news and the internet, repeating the same question: Is it safe?So why make a fuss? I make medical device prototypes for a living, so I understand some of the health stakes & liability risks. I also make toys. The Consumer Product Safety Commission limits lead on surface coatings in toys to no more than 90 parts per million.[2] That's less than a quarter of the concentrations the EPA allows in lead contaminated soil.[3] Yet almost every day I see toddlers and kids crawling on and handling Chunk Rubber infill at our local playground! And, they almost never wash their hands before picking their noses or sucking their thumbs. Believe me, I have two kids of my own...I've seen it all!
There's absolutely NO WAY the Consumer Product Safety Commission or the Toy Industry Association, would ever allow choke-able Chunk & Crumb Rubber, laced with toxic metals, wires, fibers and road chemicals to be used as toys, right? So why are toddlers allowed to play on it, or in it or with it? And If it's unsafe for toddlers, it's just as likely to be equally unsafe for older children too!Regardless of what ""industry officials"" might say, we need to begin providing 3rd party monitoring of Artificial Turf  Crumb-Rubber installations throughout our nation immediately! Our health and that of our children absolutely depends upon it!The Impact...
 
By helping to fund this Campaign, we can extend screening to hundreds, even thousands of communities throughout our nation with similar concerns.
I've been a vocal opponent of Artificial Turf from the beginning because it seems common sense to me (and many others), that using Ground-up Car Tires as playground material may present a real health hazard to our children. Despite our many concerns and questions, Turf Industry Officials, hired Inspectors and Federal & State regulators continue to tout only the benefits of Crumb & Chunk rubber products, a strategy vaguely reminiscent to that of the tobacco industry. 
Other than a few often quoted reports, no conclusive documentation has been provided proving once and for all that every installation of this material is safe for children to play on. 

Each day more and more recycled materials are turned into widely used consumer products, often sourced from nations with far greater environmental challenges than we have here in the US. 
It's nearly impossible to test everything that we import unless we work together. 

When considering the massive environmental cleanup needs of places like China, Africa, South America and the war torn Middle East, we need to ensure that recycled rubber products that our children play on aren't tainted with unregulated chemicals and toxic materials. 
By taking this first step to identify where the hazards may exist, ordinary people like you and I can make an incredible difference.If we're successful together in assuming this challenge, perhaps someday soon we can apply similar methods with the help of others in nations where impoverished communities struggle everyday to cope with issues of pollution, sanitation, lack of healthy foods & clean water. Please help.Risks & Challenges


I expect that this project will involve an enormous amount of time and legal & scientific challenges, many no doubt posed by more well funded and influential industry representatives. But, we only need to find a few bad tires in the soccer field to get things cooking, right? So, I'm up for the challenge if you are!
And, while community based volunteer pre-screening of collected Crumb Rubber materials with 3rd party testing may still not provide enough evidence of largess to pose a challenge to the industry, there's no reason not to try. Right?Even though this effort may ultimately require far greater funding and experience than an International Crowd Sourced Environmental Campaign on Indiegogo can raise, if we're successful in finding even one instance of Crumb Rubber Toxicity... we'll be vindicated many times over by the lives we save! 


Imagine how that might feel!My background:  My name is Steve Longpre and I'm the Founder of Barnstorm Studio, a small Education Research & Product Development Company, located in South Hadley, Massachusetts. I have a B.S. in Geology/Geochemistry from the UMASS, Amherst, where I studied among other things, Groundwater Hydrology, Physics, Engineering, Remote Environmental Sensing and Social Responsibility. While pursuing my education, I gained valuable Entrepreneurial experience by starting a weekend Sports Entertainment company, to put myself through college. That makes me ""in"" the industry, and a critic!


I own & operate our areas first thermoplastics 3D Printing company, where I work everyday with professionals from area businesses, colleges and hospitals to bring Additive Manufacturing to our region's schools and healthcare industries. To provide workforce development for my industry, I also work part-time as a Technologies Instructor and Substitute Teacher at middle & high schools in our surrounding towns. So If that doesn't convince you, here's what should: 
You're the one who's read this far! So you must agree with something I've said. If so, then we can do this if we work together as a team, and have fun while doing it!   Other Ways You Can Help
We need help contacting people who can locate turf installations around the country. If you're unable to contribute financially, please help spread the word about this project within your neighboring communities.

Act now! Everyday we wait, new playgrounds, sports fields and neighbors are installing Crumb Rubber materials in our communities with little to no 3rd party testing and certification. We need to change that, and potentially affect the lives of thousands of people for the better![1] State of California-Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), Contractor’s Report to the Board.

Wir wollen etwas hinsichtlich der aktuellen Situation hinsichtlich des Umweltbewusstseins verändern. Deshalb werden wir das Hostel aus Ecobricks, recycelten Materialien und nachhaltigen heimischen Ressourcen wie Bambus bauen. Außerdem wird sich die Philosophie des Hostels ganz um das Thema „zero waste“ drehen. Das heißt wir werden so wenig Müll (vor allem Plastikmüll) wie möglich produzieren. Auf diese Weise wollen wir auch unsere zukünftigen Gäste und auch Filipinos dazu inspirieren unserem Beispiel zu folgen und ihren „ökologischen Fußabdruck“ so gering wie möglich zu halten.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565606869/smng6xbzrq1o58qyfoyo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>Ein zu Hause für Reisende und Einheimische</h3><p>Unsere Mission ist es mit gutem Beispiel für alle voran zu gehen, indem wir einen Ort für Reisende und Einheimische kreieren, wo beide voneinander profitieren und lernen können.</p><p>Wir wollen kein neues Touristen Resort bauen, wir wollen Reisenden in einer authentischen Umgebung die Natur und Kultur der Philippinen näherbringen. Das Leben auf den Philippinen dreht sich um das Leben in einer Gemeinschaft, Teilen und Teamwork. Es ist ein einfaches, aber glückliches Leben. Verglichen hiermit ist unser Lebensstil in der `westlichen` Welt um einiges schnelllebiger und von mehr Individualismus geprägt. Unser Wissen über eine umweltfreundliche Lebensweise ist aber deutlich entwickelter als hier auf den Philippinen. Es ist hier leider noch ein alltägliches Bild, dass der Müll verbrannt oder im Meer entsorgt wird.

Unsere Vorstellung ist es, Tauchgänge und Tauchkurse vor allem auch für Einheimische für einen sehr erschwinglichen Preis anzubieten. Mit einem durchschnittlichen Gehalt auf den Philippinen ist es definitiv nicht möglich, sich einen Tauchkurs leisten zu können. Auf diesem Weg wollen wir eine Zugang zu dieser komplett anderen Welt unter der Wasseroberfläche eröffnen, um verständlich zu machen wie wichtig es ist diese Welt erhalten und zu schützen.</p><p>Aus Erfahrung können wir berichten, dass die Motivation die Unterwasserwelt zu beschützen deutlich ansteigt, wenn man die Möglichkeit hatte diese beim Tauchen zu erkunden. Oft kommt dann der Wunsch an Umweltschutzprojekten teilzunehmen ganz von selbst. Wenn du einmal eine wunderschöne und noch gesunde Unterwasserwelt gesehen hast, rückt der Wunsch diese zu beschützen immer mehr in den Vordergrund.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565607042/uxpgazz9ph26vqremdfo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>Wo findet ihr Dauin?</h3><p>Dauin befindet sich im Süden der Insel Negros, die sich in der Visaya Region der Philippinen befindet.

<h2><strong>Ecohostel en la isla de Negros, Filipinas</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Forma parte de nuestro proyecto y ayúdanos a construir nuestro hostal de ensueño, ecológico y enfocado en el buceo, situado en las Filipinas</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Nuestro equipo</strong></h3>
<p>El equipo de Mangotree Ecohostel está formado por Julia, Lhouwie, Pilar y Toni. Somos cuatro amigos de distintas partes del mundo con una inmensa pasión por el océano, el buceo, y el estilo de vida filipino. Por supuesto, tenemos en mente el ampliar el equipo, pero la idea de empezar este proyecto fue de los cuatro. Hemos decidido dejarlo todo atrás para cumplir nuestro sueño de abrir un Ecohostel en Dauin, en la isla de Negros, Filipinas.</p>
<p>De profesión, tenemos a una arquitecta, a una instructora de buceo, y además tenemos experiencia en la hospitalidad. La mezcla perfecta para abrir un ecohostel de buceo.</p>
<p>Tras un arduo trabajo de ahorrar dinero en el último año y a las espaldas ya varios meses trabajando en el proyecto, estamos aún un pelín cortos de presupuesto. Es por ello por lo que necesitamos tu preciada ayuda para poder hacer nuestro sueño realidad.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565606124/rcrmtq7f2jyneghgdddm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>El nombre</strong></h3>
<p>¿Por qué <strong>Mango Tree Ecohostel</strong>? En la parcela donde se erigirá el hostal tenemos árboles frutales de mango. Esto significa, que no solo tenemos mangos deliciosos (los mangos de las Filipinas tienen fama de ser los más ricos del mundo) para disfrutar con nuestros invitados, sino que habrá casas en los árboles. Vivir en un árbol de mango, con vistas al océano. Suena increíble, ¿no crees? Por supuesto, no haremos ningún daño a estos árboles, ya que todo en nuestro hostal será ecológico y respetuoso con el medio ambiente.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Mucho más que un simple hostal…</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>100% sostenible y construcción ecológica</strong></h3>
<p>Nuestro hostal va a ser construido de la nada. Y no únicamente eso… El concepto de nuestro hostal está basado en conservación marina y ecoconstrucción, y muy focalizado en la concienciación ecológica, así como en el cambio del estilo de vida insostenible que los seres humanos tenemos. Es por ello que, entre otras cosas, el hostal será construido con ecoladrillos, materiales reciclados y recursos naturales sostenibles como el bambú, abundante en la zona. No os preocupéis, soy arquitecta y la construcción será segura, cómoda, y bonita. Asimismo, una vez el hostal esté terminado, queremos vivir de forma completamente sostenible (movimiento llamado “residuo cero”). De este modo queremos animar a los viajeros y locales a seguir nuestro ejemplo, reduciendo nuestra huella ecológica.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565606869/smng6xbzrq1o58qyfoyo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Un hogar para viajeros y locales</strong></h3>
<p>Nuestra meta es el dar ejemplo a todos con el estilo de vida y las prácticas sostenibles, creando un espacio para viajeros y filipinos donde ambos podrán beneficiarse de una relación simbiótica, aprendiendo los unos de los otros, así como del respeto al medio ambiente. Nuestra idea no es crear un nuevo resort turístico, sino el mostrar a los visitantes lo precioso que es el país y la cultura filipina. Esta cultura es muy interesante, con su vida en comunidad, su modo tan puro de compartir, y el trabajo en equipo. Una vida simple pero feliz, de la que debiéramos aprender en nuestro mundo globalizado, donde el individualismo y la rapidez reinan en nuestro día a día. Esta forma de vida filipina, a su vez, también debería aprender de la sobre concienciación y respecto por el medio ambiente. Con la ayuda de todos aquellos que estén con nosotros, queremos enseñar modos alternativos de desechar residuos, en lugar de quemarlos o tirarlos al océano.</p>
<p> Queremos crear un lugar donde se produzca un intercambio cultural que beneficie a todos.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565626392/ibu8c7pwhqtalhmdwzwb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Aprende a bucear</strong></h3>
<p>Nuestro hostal va a estar rodeado de zonas acuáticas llenas de corales y vida marina, y nos gustaría que todo el mundo que esté interesado en ello aprenda a bucear. Queremos ofrecer buceo a un precio muy económico, y aún más económico para los locales, con el objetivo de brindarles la oportunidad de observar ese mundo marino que tienen y ayudarles a entender mejor la importancia de proteger y preservar dicho mundo.</p>
<p>Cualquiera que empieza a bucear se vuelve un enamorado del océano y la vida acuática, y comienza a valorarlo y protegerlo, con acciones como recoger plástico y basura de él, viendo documentales educativos, y contando a los demás la belleza de dicho océano y los problemas que atraviesa por culpa de nuestra huella en él. Cuando observas con tus propios ojos ese mundo marino tan bello y aún sano, simplemente te enamoras de él y te importa su conservación.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565607042/uxpgazz9ph26vqremdfo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>¿Dónde está Dauin?</strong></h3>
<p>Dauin está situado en el sur de la isla de Negros, en Visayas Central. Negros es la cuarta isla más grande de Filipinas.</p>
<p>El área donde estará nuestro hostal es famosa por su naturaleza salvaje, incluyendo cascadas, fuentes termales, lagos, montañas y, lo que la hace única y especial, su hermoso mundo marino. La costa de Dauin ofrece hermosos corales, así como uno de los mejores muckdiving a nivel mundial. Enfrente tenemos Apo Island, conocido como uno de los lugares más bonitos de buceo de las Filipinas, con impresionantes corales y tortugas nadando alrededor. La zona cuenta con una vida marina muy rica y variada, donde se pueden encontrar especies muy extrañas y especiales. Hay mucho que explorar por la zona, tanto dentro como fuera del agua.</p>
<p>Se puede llegar a Dauin aterrizando en los aeropuertos internacionales de Manila o Cebu, y desde estos aeropuertos, tomar un vuelo doméstico o un ferry a Dumaguete. Desde Dumaguete hasta nuestro hostal hay sólo media hora de camino en bus.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>¿Cuándo inauguraremos el hostal?</strong></h3>
<p>Planeamos abrir para abril del 2020. Estaremos muy felices de recibir a todo el mundo con los brazos abiertos en Mangotree ecohostel.</p>
<p><strong>Creemos firmemente que para poder crear un cambio global, debemos comenzar con comunidades pequeñas, mostrando un ejemplo impecable de como ser sostenibles y respetuosos con el medio ambiente. Esta es nuestra meta para el hostal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>¡Ayúdanos a conseguir nuestra meta de propiciar un cambio y comparte el amor por nuestro planeta y océano!</strong></p>

Mangotree Ecohostel Negros Island, Philippines
 Become a part of our Project and help us build our dream Eco-diving-hostel in the Philippines Our teamThe team behind Mangotree Ecohostel will be Julia, Lhouwie, Pilar and Toni. We are four friends from all over the world with a huge passion for the ocean and scuba diving as well as the Filipino way of life. Of course, we want our team to grow with time but between the four of us the idea to build Mangotree Ecohostel started. Now we want to leave everything behind to achieve our dream of opening an Ecohostel in Dauin, Negros Island in the Philippines.Our professions are Scuba Diving Instructor, Architect and Hospitality. The perfect mixture to open an ecofriendly diving hostel.After a lot of savings during the last year and a lot of work, we are still a little bit short on our budget. That`s why we need your help to make our dream come true. The nameWhy Mango Tree Ecohostel? We will have a lot of beautiful, huge Mango trees on the land where we will build the hostel. That means we will not only have a lot of delicious Mangos for us and our guests, we will also build tree houses in the Mango trees. Living on top of a Mango tree, next to the ocean. Sounds amazing, right? Of course, we will not damage the Mango trees since everything in our hostel will be ecological and environmentally friendly. What is special about our project? More than just a hostel...100 % Sustainable and ecological buildingWe will build our hostel from scratch. And that`s not the only thing... The idea of the hostel focuses on marine conservation and ecological building with a focus on environmental awareness and change. That’s why the hostel will be built out of ecobricks, recycled materials and sustainable native sources such as bamboo. Also after the hostel is done we want to live completely sustainable – means `zero waste`. This way we want to encourage Backpackers and locals to follow our example to reduce the environmental footprint. Home for travellers and localsOur mission is to set an example for everybody, creating a place for backpackers and locals where both can benefit from a symbiotic relationship with each other and the environment. We don`t want to create a new tourist resort, we want to show backpackers how beautiful the Philippine culture and nature is.  Filipino culture is about living in community, sharing, and teamwork. A simple life but happy. Compare this with our western lives, where everything goes faster and it is much more individualistic, however, it is generally more aware and respectful with the environment. With the help of everyone staying with us, we are going to show different ways of waste disposal instead of throwing it into the ocean or burning it.We would like to create a place where we can amalgamate the best of both cultures for the benefit of all.  Learn how to diveOur hostel will be surrounded by beautiful dive spots and we really want to make it possible for everyone to learn how to dive. We want to offer very cheap diving for locals to show them there is another world below the water and help them understand how important it is to protect and preserve this world.People who are just beginning their diving journeys really begin to cherish the ocean and aquatic life and take action to protect it like picking up trash, watching educational documentaries and telling others about the problems they see. Once you see an amazing healthy underwater world, you fall in love and want to protect it. Where is Dauin?Dauin is located in the South of Negros Island in Central Visayas. Negros is the fourth largest island in the Philippines.The area of Dauin is famous for its wild nature including waterfalls, hot springs, lakes, mountains and most of all for its beautiful underwater world. The coast of Dauin offers beautiful reefs and world-class muck diving. Close by you can find Apo island which is known for its impressive coral reefs and turtles swimming around. For divers, it’s the perfect spot to explore a huge variety of marine life. There is a lot to explore in the area. Above the surface as well as underneath.You can reach Dauin via the international airport in  Cebu City or Manila. From there you can take a domestic flight or a ferry to Dumaguete city. Dumaguete to Dauin is only a 30 minutes bus ride. When are we going to be open?The opening will be on April 2020. We are happy about everyone who is coming to visit us in Mangotree Ecohostel.We strongly believe that in order to create a global change, we need to start with the little communities and role modelling how it should be done. This is our goal for the hostel. Help us achieve our goal to make a change and share our love for the earth and the ocean!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Link zum deutschen Video: https://youtu.be/o3TKI8jNSSE Ecohostel Insel Negros, Philippinen Werde Teil unseres Projekts und helfe uns dabei unseren Traum ein Eco- und Tauch- Hostel auf den Philippinen zu eröffnen. Unser TeamDas Team von Mango Tree Ecohostel wird aus Julia, Lhouwie, Pilar und Toni bestehen. Uns verbindet die Leidenschaft für den Ozean, das Tauchen und die philippinische Lebensweise. Natürlich wird unser Team mit der Zeit hoffentlich noch wachsen, doch unter uns vieren entstand die Idee zu Mangotree Ecohostel.In unserem jetzigen Leben sind wir als Tauchlehrer, Architektin und in der Gastronomiebranche tätig. Hieraus ergibt sich die perfekt Zusammensetzung, um unser Projekt zu verwirklichen.Jeder von uns hat versucht im letzten Jahr so viel wie möglich zu arbeiten und zu sparen, damit wir uns diesen Traum erfüllen können. Leider ist unser Budget trotzdem noch etwas knapp. Deshalb brauchen wir deine Hilfe, um unseren Traum zur Wirklichkeit zu machen. Der NameWoher kommt der Name? Auf dem Land auf dem wir unser Hostel bauen werden gibt es wunderschöne, riesige Mangobäume. Und wir werden diese auch nutzen. Nicht nur, dass die Bäume uns und unseren Gästen leckere Mangofrüchte liefern werden, sondern wie werden Baumhäuser bauen. Wohnen in Mitten eines Mangobaums, direkt am Meer. Das hört sich gut an, oder? Natürlich werden wir die Bäume dabei nicht beschädigen, da der Umweltschutz bei unserem ganzen Projekt an erster Stelle steht. Was ist das Besondere an unserem Projekt? Mehr als nur ein Hostel…100 % nachhaltige und ökologische BauweiseWir werden unser Hostel komplett neu bauen. Und das ist noch nicht alles… Das ganze Projekt wird unter dem Motto  „ökologisches Bauen und Projekte zum Schutz der Meere“ stehen. Wir wollen etwas hinsichtlich der aktuellen Situation hinsichtlich des Umweltbewusstseins verändern. Deshalb werden wir das Hostel aus Ecobricks, recycelten Materialien und nachhaltigen heimischen Ressourcen wie Bambus bauen. Außerdem wird sich die Philosophie des Hostels ganz um das Thema „zero waste“ drehen. Das heißt wir werden so wenig Müll (vor allem Plastikmüll) wie möglich produzieren. Auf diese Weise wollen wir auch unsere zukünftigen Gäste und auch Filipinos dazu inspirieren unserem Beispiel zu folgen und ihren „ökologischen Fußabdruck“ so gering wie möglich zu halten. Ein zu Hause für Reisende und EinheimischeUnsere Mission ist es mit gutem Beispiel für alle voran zu gehen, indem wir einen Ort für Reisende und Einheimische kreieren, wo beide voneinander profitieren und lernen können.Wir wollen kein neues Touristen Resort bauen, wir wollen Reisenden in einer authentischen Umgebung die Natur und Kultur der Philippinen näherbringen. Das Leben auf den Philippinen dreht sich um das Leben in einer Gemeinschaft, Teilen und Teamwork. Es ist ein einfaches, aber glückliches Leben. Verglichen hiermit ist unser Lebensstil in der `westlichen` Welt um einiges schnelllebiger und von mehr Individualismus geprägt. Unser Wissen über eine umweltfreundliche Lebensweise ist aber deutlich entwickelter als hier auf den Philippinen. Es ist hier leider noch ein alltägliches Bild, dass der Müll verbrannt oder im Meer entsorgt wird. Mit der Hilfe von allen, die bei uns zu Gast sind, wollen wir deshalb aufzeigen, welche Alternativen es zur Müllentsorgung gibt und allgemein zu mehr Umweltbewusstsein motivieren.In unserem Hostel wollen wir durch kulturellen Austausch das Beste aus beiden Welten verbinden, sodass jeder am Ende daraus profitieren kann. TauchenUnser Hostel wird von wunderschönen Tauchspots umgeben sein und wir wollen jedem die Möglichkeit bieten Tauchen zu lernen. Unsere Vorstellung ist es, Tauchgänge und Tauchkurse vor allem auch für Einheimische für einen sehr erschwinglichen Preis anzubieten. Mit einem durchschnittlichen Gehalt auf den Philippinen ist es definitiv nicht möglich, sich einen Tauchkurs leisten zu können. Auf diesem Weg wollen wir eine Zugang zu dieser komplett anderen Welt unter der Wasseroberfläche eröffnen, um verständlich zu machen wie wichtig es ist diese Welt erhalten und zu schützen.Aus Erfahrung können wir berichten, dass die Motivation die Unterwasserwelt zu beschützen deutlich ansteigt, wenn man die Möglichkeit hatte diese beim Tauchen zu erkunden. Oft kommt dann der Wunsch an Umweltschutzprojekten teilzunehmen ganz von selbst. Wenn du einmal eine wunderschöne und noch gesunde Unterwasserwelt gesehen hast, rückt der Wunsch diese zu beschützen immer mehr in den Vordergrund. Wo findet ihr Dauin?Dauin befindet sich im Süden der Insel Negros, die sich in der Visaya Region der Philippinen befindet. Negros ist dabei die viert größte Insel auf den Philippinen.Die Region um Dauin ist vor allem für Ihre schöne Natur bekannt. Du findest hier Wasserfälle, heiße Quellen, Zwillings- Seen  und vor allem eine wunderschöne Unterwasserwelt. An der Küste von Dauin gibt es farbenfrohe Korallen Riffe und weltklasse Muckdiving. Ganz in der Nähe befindet sich außerdem `Apo- Island`, eine kleine Insel, die für ihre atemberaubenden Korallenriffe und die vielen Schildkröten, bekannt ist. Die Artenvielfalt unter Wasser in der Region ist unglaublich groß, was sie zum perfekten Spot für Taucher macht. In der Region um Dauin gibt es einiges zu erkunden. Unter der Wasseroberfläche als auch oberhalb.Man erreicht Dauin, indem man einen der internationalen Flughäfen in Cebu City der Manila ansteuert und dann von dort aus dann entweder mit einem Inlandsflug oder einer Fähre nach Dumaguete City reist. Von dort erreicht man Dauin mit dem Bus innerhalb von 30 Minuten. Wann werden wir eröffnen?Die Eröffnung wird im April 2020 sein, wenn alles nach Plan läuft. Wir freuen uns über jeden, der uns im Mangotree  Ecohostel besuchen kommt.Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass es wichtig ist mit kleinen Schritten anzufangen und eine Vorbildfunktion einzunehmen, wenn es um den Umgang mit der Natur geht. Nur so können wir am Ende eine globale Änderung erreichen. Deshalb ist es eines unserer größten Ziele mit der Gemeinschaft unseres Hostels ein Umdenken zu erzeugen und auch andere dazu zu motivieren ihre ökologischen Fußspuren so klein wie möglich zu halten.Wir brauchen deine Hilfe, um unseren Traum zu erfüllen und einen Schritt in eine umweltfreundlichere Zukunft zu gehen. Teile die Liebe zur Natur und für den Ozean mit uns!  Was bekomme ich, wenn ich das Projekt unterstütze?Unser größter Wunsch ist es, dass alle unsere Unterstützer uns auch auf den Philippinen besuchen kommen, um mit eigenen Augen zu sehen, was wir erreicht haben.

Ecohostel en la isla de Negros, Filipinas
 
Forma parte de nuestro proyecto y ayúdanos a construir nuestro hostal de ensueño, ecológico y enfocado en el buceo, situado en las Filipinas
 
Nuestro equipo
El equipo de Mangotree Ecohostel está formado por Julia, Lhouwie, Pilar y Toni. Somos cuatro amigos de distintas partes del mundo con una inmensa pasión por el océano, el buceo, y el estilo de vida filipino. Por supuesto, tenemos en mente el ampliar el equipo, pero la idea de empezar este proyecto fue de los cuatro. Hemos decidido dejarlo todo atrás para cumplir nuestro sueño de abrir un Ecohostel en Dauin, en la isla de Negros, Filipinas.
De profesión, tenemos a una arquitecta, a una instructora de buceo, y además tenemos experiencia en la hospitalidad. La mezcla perfecta para abrir un ecohostel de buceo.
Tras un arduo trabajo de ahorrar dinero en el último año y a las espaldas ya varios meses trabajando en el proyecto, estamos aún un pelín cortos de presupuesto. Es por ello por lo que necesitamos tu preciada ayuda para poder hacer nuestro sueño realidad.

 
El nombre
¿Por qué Mango Tree Ecohostel? En la parcela donde se erigirá el hostal tenemos árboles frutales de mango. Esto significa, que no solo tenemos mangos deliciosos (los mangos de las Filipinas tienen fama de ser los más ricos del mundo) para disfrutar con nuestros invitados, sino que habrá casas en los árboles. Vivir en un árbol de mango, con vistas al océano. Suena increíble, ¿no crees? Por supuesto, no haremos ningún daño a estos árboles, ya que todo en nuestro hostal será ecológico y respetuoso con el medio ambiente.
 
Mucho más que un simple hostal…
100% sostenible y construcción ecológica
Nuestro hostal va a ser construido de la nada. Y no únicamente eso… El concepto de nuestro hostal está basado en conservación marina y ecoconstrucción, y muy focalizado en la concienciación ecológica, así como en el cambio del estilo de vida insostenible que los seres humanos tenemos. Es por ello que, entre otras cosas, el hostal será construido con ecoladrillos, materiales reciclados y recursos naturales sostenibles como el bambú, abundante en la zona. No os preocupéis, soy arquitecta y la construcción será segura, cómoda, y bonita. Asimismo, una vez el hostal esté terminado, queremos vivir de forma completamente sostenible (movimiento llamado “residuo cero”). De este modo queremos animar a los viajeros y locales a seguir nuestro ejemplo, reduciendo nuestra huella ecológica.

 
Un hogar para viajeros y locales
Nuestra meta es el dar ejemplo a todos con el estilo de vida y las prácticas sostenibles, creando un espacio para viajeros y filipinos donde ambos podrán beneficiarse de una relación simbiótica, aprendiendo los unos de los otros, así como del respeto al medio ambiente. Nuestra idea no es crear un nuevo resort turístico, sino el mostrar a los visitantes lo precioso que es el país y la cultura filipina. Esta cultura es muy interesante, con su vida en comunidad, su modo tan puro de compartir, y el trabajo en equipo. Una vida simple pero feliz, de la que debiéramos aprender en nuestro mundo globalizado, donde el individualismo y la rapidez reinan en nuestro día a día. Esta forma de vida filipina, a su vez, también debería aprender de la sobre concienciación y respecto por el medio ambiente. Con la ayuda de todos aquellos que estén con nosotros, queremos enseñar modos alternativos de desechar residuos, en lugar de quemarlos o tirarlos al océano.
 Queremos crear un lugar donde se produzca un intercambio cultural que beneficie a todos.

 
Aprende a bucear
Nuestro hostal va a estar rodeado de zonas acuáticas llenas de corales y vida marina, y nos gustaría que todo el mundo que esté interesado en ello aprenda a bucear. Queremos ofrecer buceo a un precio muy económico, y aún más económico para los locales, con el objetivo de brindarles la oportunidad de observar ese mundo marino que tienen y ayudarles a entender mejor la importancia de proteger y preservar dicho mundo.
Cualquiera que empieza a bucear se vuelve un enamorado del océano y la vida acuática, y comienza a valorarlo y protegerlo, con acciones como recoger plástico y basura de él, viendo documentales educativos, y contando a los demás la belleza de dicho océano y los problemas que atraviesa por culpa de nuestra huella en él. Cuando observas con tus propios ojos ese mundo marino tan bello y aún sano, simplemente te enamoras de él y te importa su conservación.

 
¿Dónde está Dauin?
Dauin está situado en el sur de la isla de Negros, en Visayas Central. Negros es la cuarta isla más grande de Filipinas.
El área donde estará nuestro hostal es famosa por su naturaleza salvaje, incluyendo cascadas, fuentes termales, lagos, montañas y, lo que la hace única y especial, su hermoso mundo marino. La costa de Dauin ofrece hermosos corales, así como uno de los mejores muckdiving a nivel mundial. Enfrente tenemos Apo Island, conocido como uno de los lugares más bonitos de buceo de las Filipinas, con impresionantes corales y tortugas nadando alrededor. La zona cuenta con una vida marina muy rica y variada, donde se pueden encontrar especies muy extrañas y especiales. Hay mucho que explorar por la zona, tanto dentro como fuera del agua.
Se puede llegar a Dauin aterrizando en los aeropuertos internacionales de Manila o Cebu, y desde estos aeropuertos, tomar un vuelo doméstico o un ferry a Dumaguete. Desde Dumaguete hasta nuestro hostal hay sólo media hora de camino en bus.
 
¿Cuándo inauguraremos el hostal?
Planeamos abrir para abril del 2020. Estaremos muy felices de recibir a todo el mundo con los brazos abiertos en Mangotree ecohostel.
Creemos firmemente que para poder crear un cambio global, debemos comenzar con comunidades pequeñas, mostrando un ejemplo impecable de como ser sostenibles y respetuosos con el medio ambiente. Esta es nuestra meta para el hostal.
¡Ayúdanos a conseguir nuestra meta de propiciar un cambio y comparte el amor por nuestro planeta y océano!

We were really impacted by the pandemic and it got us thinking about what we are doing to better the world we live in… The Billion Trees Project is the result.  We provide a connection between businesses and global ambitions using a unique, affordable and easy to use tool to gain customer data in exchange for planting trees. Why did you decide this was important I hear you ask?….Studies suggest that between 75%-90% of the total global carbon emissions are produced by businesses and not individuals. So, there has never been a time when businesses have been held more accountable for their carbon footprint.Not only that, 71% of customers prefer to buy from companies who are aligned with their values. The movement for sustainability is being driven by the 18-24 year old market, which means it is only going to increase. This is backed up with sustainable searches growing 7% month on month in 2020. Yet most companies feel it is too difficult for the business to achieve their carbon neutral goals.The Billion Trees Project allows our users' existing and potential customers to see their brands sustainable commitment. This brings their values into alignment whilst reducing the businesses customer acquisition cost.Meanwhile the world's most impoverished areas are given meaningful employment to end famine and replant the forests that should never have been destroyed. Why do we need your help?We are lucky enough to have a team who have worked tirelessly to get The Billion Trees Project functional. Unfortunately due to intensively working on this new product through the pandemic, this is where the budget ended. So, this is where you come in like some kind of Greta Thunberg, Marvel superhero hybrid to take the product to the good people of this world.You may be thinking, what makes you so sure the world needs this? You’ll be glad to know we asked this question before we started.The fact is that all statistics show that consumers want brands to be more environmentally friendly. They show that businesses want to reduce their carbon footprint. Unfortunately there just isn’t a simple and beneficial way for them to do it. Until now.This leads us on to the most important number of all. We need to raise $100k to give us the best opportunity to gain the traction needed to become a household name. I am aware that this is a big number, but it is a number that will help us to solve a much bigger problem.  So what will we do with this money? Firstly, we will be planting trees… Lots of them. Which creates employment for those who need it most. Pat yourself on the back and watch our Indiegogo forest thrive. As well as this, here is how the money is due to be spent:
$30k: Fulfilment (planting trees, staffing, hosting etc)
$20k: PR (Raising awareness through the press and public contacts)
$50k: Advertising (TV, Digital, Social)
Following our initial campaign, The Billion Trees Project is completely self sufficient.What will happen if we don’t reach our funding target?We will still plant 1 billion trees. If you haven’t already noticed, we have a fire in our bellies. This project will be a success, we will just have to choose the cheaper and less impactful avenues. Unfortunately it will just take a lot of time to organically fund the correct awareness piece this project deserves. There is one thing for sure… time is one thing this beautiful planet is sadly short on. What's the plan?Our team was created whilst building software to help businesses operate in a more efficient and profitable way. We have enjoyed a modest level of success with it too. However, there is something about a global pandemic and a year where the world literally burned, that makes you look at things that are bigger than profit. It allowed us to think about how we can really better everyone’s lives. The Billion Trees Project is the culmination of those thoughts.In reality, YOU are the reason that The Billion Trees Project exists. Whether you are a consumer pushing for change or the business owner pulling your hair out trying to run a business, without adding, ‘how to help better the planet’ to your to do list. We have made it easy and cost effective to do your part. Why 1 billion trees?1 Billion Trees is a perfect starting point. Vastly huge but somehow wildly attainable. After all an easy goal is just a to-do list.You may be thinking what does 1 billion trees mean for the world… What will it do?When trees grow they take harmful co2 and absorb the carbon. They then emit the lovely oxygen we need to live and breath. 1 billion trees can absorb 21,000,000,000 kg of carbon every year. That number is monstrous, let's convert it into something we can comprehend.  Even with this massive effort we will only be offsetting the world’s average carbon of 5.25m people or at the average US consumption of a mere 1m people. So we have work to do. Rest assured with your help, we will make the planet breathe again.
We can show consumers where their responsible brands are
We can increase businesses profits sustainably
We can end poverty in the places that need us most
We will plant 1 billion trees.
 We all have the opportunity to leave this world in a better position than we found it in. How else can you help?We do however understand that, not everyone is in a position to financially support us. Just remember what our funding is for… It is to take The Billion Trees Project and shout about it from the rooftops. Money can amplify it... but everyone has a voice. Share us with your friends, ask your brands what they are doing to help.Be accountable. Hold others accountable. Be a positive voice for change.Every big dream starts with a small step forward… We have our walking boots on. Image credit: Our planting partner Eden Reforestation & Unsplash",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b>What can RePlast block be used for today?</b>
<p>Currently,
RePlast blocks are structured as a fit-for-purpose material. This means we are
able to control the density and weight of the current block material. In the
US, they are perfect for walling applications, non-inhabited structures (park
facilities, warehouses, rest areas, roadways projects, additional layers to
enhance insulating properties and acoustics to name a few.</p>
<p>Outside
of the US, RePlast can be to build single-story, single family homes and other
inhabited spaces up.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What does fit-for-purpose mean?</b></p>
<p>For RePlast, fit-for-purpose means that it meets the required standard for the job it is intended to perform. Since RePlast is customizable in shape, density and weight, it can perform many different jobs or serve many different purposes.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Are the RePlast blocks fire resistant? </b></p>
<p>Currently,
and without additional additives, RePlast holds similar fire rating to that of
Trex lumber. Fire retardants, can be used during the manufacturing
process to enhance its resistance. Additional testing is required. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How heavy are the RePlast blocks?</b></p>
<p>We are able to control the weight/density of RePlast.  We can make them anywhere from <span style=""background-color: initial;"">8 - 27 lbs/3.5 - 12 Kg. </span></p>

Color will vary.</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><b>THANK YOU!!</b></div></div>","THE GLOBAL PLASTIC CRISISPlastic waste has become
one of the most pressing environmental challenges of the 21st
Century.  Globally, we produce over 300
million tons of plastic every year and recycle only 8%.  This amount is expected to double within the next 10 years! In the US alone, roughly 28
million tons of plastic is sent to landfills every year at the staggering cost
of over $1.5 billion dollars annually.HOW MUCH IS 28 MILLION TONS?
Imagine
using all of the plastic waste we see polluting our oceans, parks,
roadways, and neighborhoods to rebuild our communities without long processing
times, labor-intensive overhead, or toxic output. At ByFusion, we envision a future where communities can put their plastic waste to work immediately – building infrastructure, housing, and municipal projects.  And now, we can.  
WHAT IS BYFUSION?
ByFusion is a 100% modular technology platform
that converts all types of waste plastic into an alternative building material called
RePlast.  Our eco-friendly process is a low emission and non-toxic way to “upcycle” plastic waste from our communities, coastlines, and landfills into a
readily-usable new product.ByFusion has been designed
as a key component in
promoting community-based circular economies – fully supporting the ability to convert plastic waste generated
within a city into a building material that can be used locally for
construction, infrastructure, and development projects.  ByFusion is capable of processing plastic collected from our oceans and coastlines and diverting millions of tons of
plastic from landfills, saving taxpayers and municipal governments billions of dollars
in costs, and creating jobs through local and regional business development.
THE BYFUSION PROCESSMost people are not aware there are actually 7 types of plastics. However, due to high processing costs, toxicity, safety concerns and potential contamination, only 3
types (1-3) are commonly processed.  However, even the commonly processed plastic must first be sorted and cleaned and often must be sent to
processing centers far from its point of entry into the waste stream.
ByFusion has addressed
this challenge by designing a system that can process ALL types of plastic waste, individually or mixed and clean
or contaminated.  Since our platform is
modular, it can be easily transported to where it’s needed the most, and can be
used as a temporary or permanent addition to local waste management processing.  
REPLAST BLOCKS – A 100%
RECYCLED NEW BUILDING MATERIAL
We have configured our
pilot ByFusion technology to produce blocks with the size and dimensions of common concrete blocks that
are designed to suit a wide variety of infrastructure, development, and
construction projects.

Characteristics of RePlast
Block

95% lower Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GhG) during production than concrete 


Better thermal and sound insultating capabilities than concrete block

Can contribute to USGBC LEED certification

Flexible manufacturing process - capable of producing
different sizes, shapes, and colors


Requires no glues or adhesives for use


RePlast is an inexpensive, fit-for-purpose
material that can be put to use fast using materials that are literally
being thrown away every day in every community on the planet.
RePlast can be used for a
wide variety of municipal projects including highway sound barriers, environmental
retaining walls, thermal
insulation for industrial and residential construction, and crash
barriers.  We are continually exploring
new ways to use our products.
OUR STORY Our team came together because our world is drowning in plastic waste and we were (and still are!) passionately committed to finding a solution.

We kept hearing about organizations and volunteers investing thousands of hours to clean up the plastic on our beaches, parks, waterways and communities but started asking ourselves, ""Where does it go?"" 
Sure, some of it gets recycled but most of it ends right back into our broken waste management systems and potentially back into the ocean.
We wanted to find a solution that

Is easy to deploy and can be sent directly to plastic pollution hotspots

Put all of the plastic waste to work – permanently

Is cost effective to build and scale

Produced a cost effective product that could be used by anyone

Maximized the efforts of those organizations and volunteers who are passionate about cleaning up our planet
Created jobs

And so, ByFusion was born.
PUTTING BYFUSION INTO ACTION

                                                        
We are partnering with innovative non-profits including our good friends at Sustainable Coastlines Hawaii to bring our technology directly to one of the most important and heavily impacted areas on the planet.
The first SCH-ByFusion joint project will focus on the plastic accumulating across all of the Hawaiian Islands, including the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, a protected area that is littered with tens of thousands of tons of plastic waste. 
This is an incredibly important area both for Hawaiians and for the world, with extensive coral reefs that are home to over 7,000 marine species, one quarter of which are found only in the Hawaiian Archipelago.
 The area is one of the planet’s great biodiversity hotspots, and is one of the largest marine conservation areas in the world. It encompasses 139,797 square miles of the Pacific Ocean which also puts it directly in the path of millions of tons of floating plastic waste.  This plastic, including an ever-increasing amount of derelict fishing nets, is damaging the pristine coral reefs as well as directly impacting the health of the endangered Hawaiian monk seal population.  WE ARE 100% COMMITTED TO HELPING OUR PLANET - ARE YOU? 

GET ENGAGED!
We have the technology and there is endless plastic waste abound but, we need your help!  
Our team is committed to making the ByFusion machine available to the masses and building strong alliances to close the loop on plastic clean up initiatives and put our
waste to work.
Your donations will enable us to do the following:


Put our technology directly to work on our first project with Sustainable Coastlines Hawaii,



Complete the required US testing to list RePlast as an approved US building material, 


Upgrade our current pilot machine to increase the amount of plastic we can process (we are estimating a 44% increase from 7,000 blocks per day to 10,000!), 


Expand our manufacturing capabilities to produce more ByFusion machines.

Risks & Challenges  Throughout the process there will be soil tests, system studies to make sure the electric grid can handle the power, and impact studies to make sure the community will not be affected negatively.  Through all of these tests and studies there will be hurdles to overcome and we have all the drive in the world to see this project through to its completion!     Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.

<div>My name is Han Parker. I'm a father, a filmmaker and an activist. </div>
<div>If even one quarter of the predictions from scientists on the negative impacts of man made global warming comes true... I will not look my children in the eye and tell them I did nothing... that we did nothing. </div>
</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>It's up to us...</b></div><div>
<div>The US government allocated about $640 Billion to the government this year alone. Science and the environment got roughly 1% of our military budget. This is incredibly frightening to me. In a time when the scientific consensus has set the doomsday clock at 11:58, congress is still not taking these issues seriously... so it is up to us. I want to show that with a small amount of money, and a large amount of attention, we can take back control of the future of the planet and the entire human race.</div>
<div>I'm asking for $1 billion and I have broken down exactly how some of that could be easily appropriated to tackle problems such as drought, pollution, oil spills, lack of resources, etc. As well as how we can move many industries towards sustainability. I also have a strong desire to help regain true democracy, where the power is in the hands of the many, not the few. This project is a chance to move together, as a community, towards a greener Earth, towards mass sustainability across all industries and towards a more transparent government that listens to it's people.</div>
<div>If $1 billion seems like a lot to ask for, consider that Americans alone spent about $4.5 billion in one day not to long ago... it was on St. Patrick's Day. $4.5 billion in one day, on beer. So we can do this! Lets not let beer be more important than the environment!!</div>
<div>I've generated some fun perks but please understand that your donations should be based off of your desire to do good for the planet! Lets do this together, lets not wait, the time for debate is over, the time for action is now. This is the vehicle!</div>
<div>If you have children, if you have a spouse, a father, a mother. If someone you love, resides on this planet, please start taking this seriously before it is to late. Here is what we can do with  $1 billion. I've listed it in monetary order, as in, the more we raise, the further down the list we can go.</div>
<div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>- BAN 2 STROKE ENGINES</b></p>
<p>This doesn't even take a lot of money, just community and awareness. We are talking about street blowers and a lot of lawn mowers. A little research will show you that they put out a boatload of unfiltered particulate matter that is downright horrible for you. Think of every lawn, in every neighborhood, all over California alone, with millions of these things running night and day. They can be easily replaced with electric motor versions. Stop these alone and we can probably cut pollution back by at least 10-15% nationwide. It can be our first immediate action and in the process we will refine our strategies and then go after bigger issues next. If you want to see 2 stroke engines banned, donate now.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Imagine a website that aims to bring a large community together and engage in Earth saving, ""green"" activities everyday. Imagine if you could log into a website and track any green saving activities that you participated in. If you opted to turn off your power for the day, or rode your bike to work instead of driving, planted a tree, picked up some trash, stopped eating meat, whatever it was, you could track it all. </p>
<p>We would encourage people to engage in these green saving activities, then log into the website and track their activities. At the end of every month, and then again at the end of every year, we would release how much change we have affected.  Statistics that say, our community saved XX amount of power this month, our community planted XX amount of trees and picked up XX lbs. of trash, and XX amount of people stopped eating meat and XX amount of people recycled their old cars, XX amount of petitions were signed, etc. etc. And we could really SEE an incredible amount of change happening. More people would join the movement, now imagine if we had 50 million people involved, all tracking their green activities, and how much change we could enable!! </p>
<p>The website also functions as a resource and directory to identify other groups/organizations who are trying to save the world, other movements that are happening and how you can get involved. A place for petitions to be created, discussed and signed. Also it would be place to see awesome videos on all sorts of cool, earth saving content (which I’ll talk about later) and it could be like a reward system where the more things you take part in, the more points you get, and then our green sponsors will be giving out rewards based off of how good you’re doing (maybe you win a trip to Leo DiCaprio's Eco Resort or something).<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This website is vital in that it could bring everyone together, working together, affecting real change, and promoting and motivating others to join, participate and excel.

<p><b>- PLANT 1 BILLION TREES BY 2017</b></p>
<p>Scientists agree that the planting of about 1 billion trees would almost definitely have a significant, positive impact on the world in so many ways. Not just in the amount of C02 that would be sucked out of the atmosphere, but creating new ecosystems for species, helping nearly extinct species regain their footholds in otherwise decimated areas, increasing the scientific studies of plants and their relations to medicine… as we regrow our forests, we regrow the worlds gardens and in these gardens we will find nature’s medicines. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A lot of other companies are claiming to do this, but it has to be done right and I think we can easily make a difference. Which is why I’m saying that we can plant one billion trees by 2017. When I say done right, the only thing worth really taking into serious account with a project like this is “invasive species” right? You can’t just go running around planting a bunch of random seeds in any old place. You could actually wreak havoc on the local ecosystem and cause more damage than good. Local committees need to be put together throughout the country that could identify “appropriate plants” that could be safely planted/integrated into said ecosystems and balance that information against what scientists tell us are the best “CO2 sucking” trees and plants. We should make sure the “area” that they are potentially looking at can sustain a bunch of new trees and then we can responsibly plant those trees/plants and thereby increase their chance of being a positive addition to that certain ecosystem.

Also would invest in things such as free energy resources like the Tesla Coil, the solar powered sterling engine, desalination, etc. I’m tired of not putting the research into these potentially life-changing technologies. I don't think we would even have to necessarily fund it, but more bring attention to it through our community and ask governments to fund it.</p>

I know there are some hurdles to overcome, especially environmentally, but we can overcome those hurdles for the sake of our futures. The old problem with Desalination Plants is that they consume a massive amount of power, a problem that now can be overcome by more efficient solar power practices.

<p>POLICY IDEAS:</p>
<p><b>- NO MORE NUCLEAR PLANTS</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>WE HAVE ONE 9.0 EARTHQUAKE SOMEWHERE and a bunch of plants leak and humanity is gone, done, wiped out. We must immediately fix every leaking reactor in the country and never again build another unless it can survive an 11.0 earthquake, a nuclear bomb, a tsunami, a tornado and all of those all at once! Because otherwise… again a massive nuclear leak is one of the few things that can literally wipeout a large portion of humanity. </p>
<p>- STRIP MINERS MUST REPLACE THE FOREST AND ECOSYSTEM THEY STRIP</p>
<p>This will deter Todd Hoffman like characters all over the world, who are allowed to go strip acres of forest in a blind, idiotic pursuit of precious metals. Many times they find nothing, and walk away, leaving the forest and ecosystem decimated with absolutely no economic return. I say we make them regrow anything they tear down, which will also deter more people from just haphazardly taking on such ventures.</p>

<p><b>- FLEXIBLE PLAN</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Finally, I'm open to other ideas too! I'm in no rush to spend all of the money, but I want to show the world what we can do with a little bit of money. Congress just spent $640 billion on our military... who are we fighting again? Dudes in the sand with swords. The war machine must no longer outweigh the priorities of the population and therefore the environment. I know it’s a lot of money to ask for, but America just spent $4.32 billion in one day… on beer. So lets not let beer be more important than the world.</p>

</div></div>","Background
My name is Han Parker. I'm a father, a filmmaker and an activist. 
If even one quarter of the predictions from scientists on the negative impacts of man made global warming comes true... I will not look my children in the eye and tell them I did nothing... that we did nothing. 
It's up to us...
The US government allocated about $640 Billion to the government this year alone. Science and the environment got roughly 1% of our military budget. This is incredibly frightening to me. In a time when the scientific consensus has set the doomsday clock at 11:58, congress is still not taking these issues seriously... so it is up to us. I want to show that with a small amount of money, and a large amount of attention, we can take back control of the future of the planet and the entire human race.
I'm asking for $1 billion and I have broken down exactly how some of that could be easily appropriated to tackle problems such as drought, pollution, oil spills, lack of resources, etc. As well as how we can move many industries towards sustainability. I also have a strong desire to help regain true democracy, where the power is in the hands of the many, not the few. This project is a chance to move together, as a community, towards a greener Earth, towards mass sustainability across all industries and towards a more transparent government that listens to it's people.
If $1 billion seems like a lot to ask for, consider that Americans alone spent about $4.5 billion in one day not to long ago... it was on St. Patrick's Day. $4.5 billion in one day, on beer. So we can do this! Lets not let beer be more important than the environment!!
I've generated some fun perks but please understand that your donations should be based off of your desire to do good for the planet! Lets do this together, lets not wait, the time for debate is over, the time for action is now. This is the vehicle!
If you have children, if you have a spouse, a father, a mother. If someone you love, resides on this planet, please start taking this seriously before it is to late. Here is what we can do with  $1 billion. I've listed it in monetary order, as in, the more we raise, the further down the list we can go.


- BAN 2 STROKE ENGINES
This doesn't even take a lot of money, just community and awareness. We are talking about street blowers and a lot of lawn mowers. A little research will show you that they put out a boatload of unfiltered particulate matter that is downright horrible for you. Think of every lawn, in every neighborhood, all over California alone, with millions of these things running night and day. They can be easily replaced with electric motor versions. Stop these alone and we can probably cut pollution back by at least 10-15% nationwide. It can be our first immediate action and in the process we will refine our strategies and then go after bigger issues next. If you want to see 2 stroke engines banned, donate now.



- BUILD AN INTERACTIVE, ""GREEN"" PROMOTING, SOCIAL WEBSITE or the Green Version of Facebook!




Imagine a website that aims to bring a large community together and engage in Earth saving, ""green"" activities everyday. Imagine if you could log into a website and track any green saving activities that you participated in. If you opted to turn off your power for the day, or rode your bike to work instead of driving, planted a tree, picked up some trash, stopped eating meat, whatever it was, you could track it all. 
We would encourage people to engage in these green saving activities, then log into the website and track their activities. At the end of every month, and then again at the end of every year, we would release how much change we have affected.  Statistics that say, our community saved XX amount of power this month, our community planted XX amount of trees and picked up XX lbs. of trash, and XX amount of people stopped eating meat and XX amount of people recycled their old cars, XX amount of petitions were signed, etc. etc. And we could really SEE an incredible amount of change happening. More people would join the movement, now imagine if we had 50 million people involved, all tracking their green activities, and how much change we could enable!! 
The website also functions as a resource and directory to identify other groups/organizations who are trying to save the world, other movements that are happening and how you can get involved. A place for petitions to be created, discussed and signed. Also it would be place to see awesome videos on all sorts of cool, earth saving content (which I’ll talk about later) and it could be like a reward system where the more things you take part in, the more points you get, and then our green sponsors will be giving out rewards based off of how good you’re doing (maybe you win a trip to Leo DiCaprio's Eco Resort or something).This website is vital in that it could bring everyone together, working together, affecting real change, and promoting and motivating others to join, participate and excel. If you love this idea and want to be part of a green community that works together for the greater good, donate now and lets get this incredible website made.


- PLANT 1 BILLION TREES BY 2017
Scientists agree that the planting of about 1 billion trees would almost definitely have a significant, positive impact on the world in so many ways. Not just in the amount of C02 that would be sucked out of the atmosphere, but creating new ecosystems for species, helping nearly extinct species regain their footholds in otherwise decimated areas, increasing the scientific studies of plants and their relations to medicine… as we regrow our forests, we regrow the worlds gardens and in these gardens we will find nature’s medicines. 
A lot of other companies are claiming to do this, but it has to be done right and I think we can easily make a difference. Which is why I’m saying that we can plant one billion trees by 2017. When I say done right, the only thing worth really taking into serious account with a project like this is “invasive species” right? You can’t just go running around planting a bunch of random seeds in any old place. You could actually wreak havoc on the local ecosystem and cause more damage than good. Local committees need to be put together throughout the country that could identify “appropriate plants” that could be safely planted/integrated into said ecosystems and balance that information against what scientists tell us are the best “CO2 sucking” trees and plants. We should make sure the “area” that they are potentially looking at can sustain a bunch of new trees and then we can responsibly plant those trees/plants and thereby increase their chance of being a positive addition to that certain ecosystem. If you want to contribute to the world being a greener place, donate now.


- DOCUMENTARY
Addiction Planet
A never before seen look into the world's addiction to war, power, wealth, nuclear, deforestation, overfishing and overpopulation. Once we can truly understand and admit to these addictions, we can finally begin to overcome them. Trailer is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiPA3ohXR0Q
Ultimately, if enough money is raised, I'd like to start a production company that makes powerful documentaries that expose environmental coverups like Fukushima and other environmental disasters. This documentary really sets the tone for the type of content that we would potentially cover. We are still in the $250,000 range here. Please, if this teaser compels you to act, please donate now.


- SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM
I would fund a gathering of the brightest minds in science, environment, biology, etc. to get together and for one month, only focus on the world's top 10 problems and how to overcome them. We would film the whole thing and make all the info available to the public. Unlike the UN's climate talks we would have transparency and encourage others to get involved. Why does Germany have superior solar power than the US? We are no longer talking about a countrywide issue here, we are talking global issues. These symposiums would encourage all countries to share their “green” and “sustainability” based sciences and notes. Lets all get on this together and we can probably knock it all out in a couple of years. If you want to see the top minds in science come together and discuss in an open format, where you can participate and voice your opinions, donate now.

- FUND SCIENCE FOR SOLAR, DESALINATION PLANTS, HEMP, ETC. 


We absolutely need to invest in more sustainable practices and materials!! I think investing in not only hemp research and technology and the application of it in the 21st century… but also many other sustainable materials that could replace more vital resources that we are running out of… such as building materials, commonly used and discarded products, toys, and just any mass consumed product. Also would invest in things such as free energy resources like the Tesla Coil, the solar powered sterling engine, desalination, etc. I’m tired of not putting the research into these potentially life-changing technologies. I don't think we would even have to necessarily fund it, but more bring attention to it through our community and ask governments to fund it.
We have to catch up with Germany on solar. Solar should be used as an example to  share vital earth technologies worldwide, for the sake of our futures. Once we get solar up to an amazing level of efficiency, we can start really ramping up desalination plants which of course can go along way to alleviate the drought conditions. Lets get the science straight, please donate now.


- DESALINATION PLANTS
It's silly to sit on the largest body of water on earth and be in a drought (I Live in California). We built the large hadron collider, we can suck some salt water out of the ocean and make it drinkable, usable at least to water all our lawn and golf courses and we can save the rest for drinking. I know there are some hurdles to overcome, especially environmentally, but we can overcome those hurdles for the sake of our futures. The old problem with Desalination Plants is that they consume a massive amount of power, a problem that now can be overcome by more efficient solar power practices. These could help contribute to solving worldwide thirst and lack of clean water problems... one of the most dire problems we face today. If you want to help see more of these come online, please donate now.


- NEWS STATION
Fund a news station that only focuses on positive, earth saving activities. You can go there anytime and they are only covering stories about these top 10 problems that are destroying the earth, what’s being done to tackle them, who is doing it, resources to get involved. Of course it is also focusing on positive stories of who is out there really affecting positive change. If you want a positive news station who is watching out for your best interests, donate now.



- PRODUCTION COMPANY
We shoot documentaries and pieces about all the bad and all the good. We point cameras at bad things and say, “Go clean it up, the world is watching.” We make little shows about how to garden, grow fish and become self sustainable. We keep the world updated on the progress of other projects and the successes of the organization. We don’t let anyone filter us, we save the world through cinema. Pointing a spotlight at the bad things and asking them to be fixed. Highlighting all the positives and reminding you how you can be involved in saving the world. Then they can’t control us.

- STRIP MINERS MUST REPLACE THE FOREST AND ECOSYSTEM THEY STRIP
This will deter Todd Hoffman like characters all over the world, who are allowed to go strip acres of forest in a blind, idiotic pursuit of precious metals. Many times they find nothing, and walk away, leaving the forest and ecosystem decimated with absolutely no economic return. I say we make them regrow anything they tear down, which will also deter more people from just haphazardly taking on such ventures.



- FLEXIBLE PLAN


Finally, I'm open to other ideas too! I'm in no rush to spend all of the money, but I want to show the world what we can do with a little bit of money.

can participate and change the stakes for the environment</b></p>
<p>
Bulgaria is famous for its great old forests, breathtaking
landscapes, clear high-mountain lakes, delicious food and wine and
hospitable local communities. Bulgaria is also known for having been a
socialist country for nearly half a century. The relationship between
nature and our political and economic history lies in our heritage
today and the threat that our magnificent mountains are facing now. 
</p>
<p>
In the following couple of years most protected areas, forest regions
and river basins in Bulgaria will get their management plans renewed and those will be valid for the next decade.
Nothing bad with updating strategic planning, you might say... And you
will be right. So, where does the problem come from? 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<b>The first problem: </b>Bulgarian post-communist legacy is one of secrecy in decision- making. Often it is impossible to find information about what is
being planned in the forest near your village. It
is not only because you do not know how to find and access the
information you need, but also because there is no such information
available publicly. <b>So we have difficult or no access to
information </b><b>and no real public discussion</b><b>.</b></p>
<p>
<b>The second problem: </b>It is an open secret that certain
political groups are connected to companies interested
in investing in activities that are harmful for protected areas. Even though there is no clear
evidence for corruption, the facts show that institutions do not to punish
crimes in protected areaswhen certain companies are
involved. <b>So we
have </b><b><span>clientelism</span></b><b>
and </b><b> institutions that are hard to
push to do their work. </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>The third problem: </b>Many investments
such as the development
of a new ski resort or a new small water
power plant have grave consequences on the environment and do not add
value to the well-being of local communities. Once again such
projects are not consulted with the public and often are executed
in violation of environmental laws. <b>So we have
lack of respect for the law and irresponsible business investments.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What
can happen?</b></p>
<p>
Currently decision-makers are under great pressure from investors to allow for changes in the strategic
planning of protected areas so that new investment projects can start
running. One such project has been waiting since 2008 when it was
declared incompatible with environmental law by the Ministry of Environment and Water itself.
The intentions and plans of the investors have not changed since
then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
You might wonder… What will happen if these changes
in management of protected areas take place?</p>
<p>
They will have catastrophic consequences for great territories with old
forests, rare plants (found only in Bulgaria), bears, chamois, clear
glacier lakes, rivers and many other precious resources. Places such
as Rila, Pirin, Rhodope and Vitosha mountains, their forests and rivers will
be damaged. 
</p>
<p>

<p>
Sustainable Mountains is a group of environmental activists including
experienced experts from environmental NGOs in Bulgaria and a group
of young and active people that love nature and feel responsible for
their community. 
</p>
<p>
We are non-political and what we do is politics. We are independent
in thought and action and we depend on institutions and
decision-makers. We trust research and hard work and we get emotional
about mountains, forests and rivers. We empower and support local
groups and we lead our individual battles. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Our history</b></p>
<p>
Some of us started working together in 2011 when there was a
proposition to change Bulgarian Forestry Law in favour of an investment project in Vitosha mountain. The civil group then was
called <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/zavitosha"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ZaVitosha</a> and
still functions as an active group in the capital of Bulgaria. Later
on in 2013 the group grew larger and three NGOs (<a href=""http://balkani.org/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Balkani WIldlife Society</a>, <a href=""http://bikearea.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bikearea Association</a> and Fishermen Society Balkanka 2009) created a partnership
in South-west Bulgaria to continue the work on changing the decision-making
process regarding mountain resources management towards more transparency and
in favour of local communities. And, we have had the Bulgarian-Swiss
Cooperation Fund's trust and funding for a little more than two years
now. We will be out of funding in the end of 2015, but our job has not
been finished yet. We need to continue until our great mountains stay
protected for the next 10 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What
we need your help for</b></p>
<p>
Sustainable Mountains will need more resources to continue its mission. Your donation will help us stay tuned with what happens in
the ministries and make this information public. It will enable us to take action
together and protect the mountains that evoke
admiration each time one looks at them. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The
only way to challenge non-transparent decision-making and nature
destruction is civil participation.
Because
the only way to counter money in politics is with people. Your

can participate and change the stakes for the environment

Bulgaria is famous for its great old forests, breathtaking
landscapes, clear high-mountain lakes, delicious food and wine and
hospitable local communities. Bulgaria is also known for having been a
socialist country for nearly half a century. The relationship between
nature and our political and economic history lies in our heritage
today and the threat that our magnificent mountains are facing now. 


In the following couple of years most protected areas, forest regions
and river basins in Bulgaria will get their management plans renewed and those will be valid for the next decade.
Nothing bad with updating strategic planning, you might say... And you
will be right. So, where does the problem come from? 



The first problem: Bulgarian post-communist legacy is one of secrecy in decision- making. Often it is impossible to find information about what is
being planned in the forest near your village. It
is not only because you do not know how to find and access the
information you need, but also because there is no such information
available publicly. So we have difficult or no access to
information and no real public discussion.

The second problem: It is an open secret that certain
political groups are connected to companies interested
in investing in activities that are harmful for protected areas. Even though there is no clear
evidence for corruption, the facts show that institutions do not to punish
crimes in protected areaswhen certain companies are
involved. So we
have clientelism
and  institutions that are hard to
push to do their work. 


The third problem: Many investments
such as the development
of a new ski resort or a new small water
power plant have grave consequences on the environment and do not add
value to the well-being of local communities. Once again such
projects are not consulted with the public and often are executed
in violation of environmental laws. So we have
lack of respect for the law and irresponsible business investments.

What
can happen?

Currently decision-makers are under great pressure from investors to allow for changes in the strategic
planning of protected areas so that new investment projects can start
running. One such project has been waiting since 2008 when it was
declared incompatible with environmental law by the Ministry of Environment and Water itself.
The intentions and plans of the investors have not changed since
then.


You might wonder… What will happen if these changes
in management of protected areas take place?

They will have catastrophic consequences for great territories with old
forests, rare plants (found only in Bulgaria), bears, chamois, clear
glacier lakes, rivers and many other precious resources. Places such
as Rila, Pirin, Rhodope and Vitosha mountains, their forests and rivers will
be damaged.

management plan of Pirin Mountain can be found in the
information graphic below:You can find a high resolution file with the info-graphic here.

Protected
areas should stay protected

Everyone knows that deforestation leads to erosion

<p>We are developing a cement which mimics the natural hardening processes
used in nature by corals and other creatures to build our reefs. </p>
<p>While it might not sound like much, this revolutionary, potentially carbon-neutral

<p>Our founder Ren Daniele moved to the Gold Coast and began searching for
sustainable development opportunities. </p>
<p>Ren carried out significant research on alternative
sustainable building materials, such as bio-fibres (hemp) for large scale
projects, aiming to develop them into a strong, pourable, useable construction
material. </p>
<p>This project even saw him investigate a mobile 3D printing
robotic system for house construction, using his hemp-based pourable material. (he's a pretty crazy guy sometimes!)</p>
<p>Having delved into the complexities &amp; development of a sustainable
material to use in residential housing construction, Ren realised he was
looking at a much bigger issue, and discovered an overall need to create a much
better, more efficient total building system.</p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">2014</b></p>
<p>At the same time as he realised this project was going to be
‘a little bit’ bigger than he first envisaged, Ren was investigating the
qualities of current building materials that he was trying to replicate sustainably. He discovered<a href=""http://www.quantumcement.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Toxic-legacy-2008ej_eip_kilns_web.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> the inconvenient truth </a><a href=""http://www.quantumcement.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Toxic-legacy-2008ej_eip_kilns_web.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>behind the production of ‘Ordinary

</div></div>","So What’s the Deal?
We are developing a cement which mimics the natural hardening processes
used in nature by corals and other creatures to build our reefs. 
While it might not sound like much, this revolutionary, potentially carbon-neutral
marine-grade cement will significantly reduce global emissions and permanently transform the entire construction industry,
especially the cement industry - which according to the US Environmental Protection Authority is currently the third largest source of pollution.
The
Big Picture!
To make a change to an industry so large, we need big ideas and massive amounts of support and funding. With our ten year project now at the halfway point, I am so proud of how far we have come, but now we need your help to move into the biggest chapter of them all. We need to raise $350,000 to put together the next piece of the puzzle, and complete the final research & testing stage to make our much needed product and process a reality. Our big hairy goal is to provide truly sustainable, environmentally
friendly building materials on an international level, and to positively impact both human and environmental health. With five solid years of research behind it, Quantum Cement is the breath of fresh air we've all been waiting for.
Even the biggest skyscrapers start with one small brick. Even the boldest
revolutions start with one person. We need you to work with us to help mother
nature combat some of the seriously crippling effects of our construction industries - and we're going to use her own recipe to do it. (you can find all the sources for numbers, facts and figures quoted here)

JUST A DROP IN THE OCEANIn essence, our project uses sea water (brine) as a source
of the minerals we need, which can either come as a by-product after a filtration process has occurred, or extracted from inland high saline waters. The system can also harness alternate non-fossil fuels, such as landfill gases or bio-gas, to produce the electricity needed.So - our process not only produces a sustainable commercial cement alternative, but can also produce electricity using non-fossil fuels.  Amazing! However, getting there is no easy task. The enormous amount of blood, sweat and tears that we have put into this project so far are just a drop in the ocean compared to what's coming next! Check out exactly what this project really looks like:
2010 - 2013
Our founder Ren Daniele moved to the Gold Coast and began searching for
sustainable development opportunities. 
Ren carried out significant research on alternative
sustainable building materials, such as bio-fibres (hemp) for large scale
projects, aiming to develop them into a strong, pourable, useable construction
material. 
This project even saw him investigate a mobile 3D printing
robotic system for house construction, using his hemp-based pourable material. (he's a pretty crazy guy sometimes!)
Having delved into the complexities & development of a sustainable
material to use in residential housing construction, Ren realised he was
looking at a much bigger issue, and discovered an overall need to create a much
better, more efficient total building system.2014
At the same time as he realised this project was going to be
‘a little bit’ bigger than he first envisaged, Ren was investigating the
qualities of current building materials that he was trying to replicate sustainably. He discovered the inconvenient truth behind the production of ‘Ordinary
Portland Cement’ (OPC) which is the cement we are all so familiar with today. OPC is created using a heat process that causes massive carbon emissions. The same heat process causes an unstable chemistry in OPC, which research is now showing causes serious health concerns in all those who come into close proximity with it! Ever been close to anything made of cement? Yeah, so have we. Scary, isn't it?



Globally, 5% of all greenhouse gases come from OPC cement
manufacture, and while it’s very hard to measure exactly, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates
another 12% of greenhouse gases are also associated with the product



Worldwide production is currently at 4 billion tonnes a
year, rising by 3% annually in line with GDP growth



Worldwide, the industry is worth $350 billion



In Australia, we are currently producing about 10 million
tonnes a year in an industry worth $2.3 billion, emitting 6 million tonnes of
CO2-e, which is around 1% of total Australian’s emissions. 


Ren focused all his research and development into a building material that could not only be sustainably produced, but could be carbon-neutral, have zero negative effects on health, be as strong and flexural (think: flexes instead of crumbles in an earthquake), be fire retardent, and of course be cost effective for the construction industry. And, Quantum Cement was born.
2015 - TODAY - THIS IS WHERE YOU FIT IN!

Our established pilot program at one of Australia's leading universities is now ready to enter the final major phase - to research and ultimately develop the formula for Quantum Cement and its manufacture on a commercial scale. This stage of the project will take two years to complete and requires USD$350,000 to fund it. 
To us, that sounded like so much money! 
That is, until we realised just how small it really is in comparison to the size of the multi-billion dollar industry we are trying so hard to change.
If the current US population stands at 321 million people, and just over 0.1% of the population donated $1 each, our project would be funded! 
If the current Australian population stands at 23 million people, and just 1.5% of the population donated $1 each, our project would be funded! 
To recap- your money will go towards the final research & testing phase for the commercial production of Quantum Cement, undertaken by one of Australia's top universities. 

By putting your hand in your pocket today, you could be the tipping point we need to make a change to a $350 billion dollar industry. 

So we are doing everything in our power to make sure this project gets to the right people and creates change - for the better. Please - help us make a difference!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3> <p>What the heck can we do about ""<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/18/you-have-never-actually-used-a-styrofoam-cup-plate-or-takeout-box/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Styrofoam</a>""? (expanded polystyrene or ""EPS"") Many recycling experts have tried to solve this problem and FAILED because <b>EPS is costly to ship and much of it is food-contaminated</b>.  When they <i>do</i> recycle EPS, it ends up as low-grade plastic (polystyrene).  Because <i>that </i>material has little value, it doesn't make economic sense to ship EPS to recycling facilities (which are <a href=""http://www.foamfacts.com/recycling/public-drop-off-locations/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">few and far between</a>).  Even though EPS is <i>technically </i>recyclable, most of it ends up in landfills, if not our streets, rivers, and even the ocean. <br/></p>
<p><i>Let's just <b><a href=""http://time.com/3660943/new-york-city-styrofoam-ban/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BAN</a> </b>it, right?</i>    Well... it turns out that banning EPS doesn't help the environment, it arguably<i> <a href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2014/04/02/why-paper-cups-just-aren-greener/W3TIBJ9dff8INlumPQvHSI/story.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">makes things worse</a>.</i>  EPS replacements cost a <i>lot</i> more, require <i>far</i> more water and energy to make, and many/most of them are not recyclable or compostable. We need a radically different approach.</p>
<p>By processing EPS and paper into composites using <b>local</b>, low-tech 
methods, <i>all</i> the EPS from your neighborhood can be turned into highly useful products. So the world is cleaner, we save energy and landfill
 space, and the money saved can be spent on <i>better things</i>. <br/></p>
<p><b>Who is Dave Pennington anyway?</b><br/></p>
<p>I am an eco-artist/inventor (some say alchemist) currently living in Dallas TX. Trained at the University of the Virgin Islands as an aquaponic systems designer, I currently work as an aquaponic farmer and in the process of optimizing that concept I developed several <b>eco-inventions</b>, mostly focused on energy management. I needed insulated tilapia tanks, so I came up with an ""EPIC"" invention. As with aquaponics, the future was waiting... in the past. I figured out how to combine EPS (invented in the 1950's) with ""papercrete"" (invented in the 1920's) and the results have been <i>AMAZING</i>. Now instead of $3/gallon, large format <i>insulated</i> tanks only cost <i>30 cents</i> per gallon, which is <b>an order of magnitude less expensive</b>. The same material can be used to build <i>tornado resistant buildings for less than $10/sq ft</i>.<br/></p>
<p><b>With your help I will be able to spread this eco-technology far and wide, and build more solutions to the world's pressing ecological problems.</b> The first order of business will be to start producing a line of simple and affordable machines for grinding and bagging EPS. At the same time a multi-lingual DVD showing how to make EPIC will be produced for mass distribution. Finally a learning portal needs to be created where people from all over the world can learn how to build food systems, house their families, and even solve the climate crisis using EPIC and other inventions. <b>We can make all this happen.</b><br/></p>
<p>I am currently working with a bunch of very sharp people who are doing some seriously interesting projects which unfortunately I can't talk  about yet. They have seen EPIC and other advances I have made, and they want to put me to work solving <i>more</i> problems, all related to the health of humanity and our planet. I have some ideas how to put <i>their</i> expertise to work. Think <i>floating islands for coral reef restoration</i>...!?! <br/></p>
<p>Please chip in a bit and help the project along, we are working as hard as we can because there is a great need for solutions, and luckily some great innovations are being developed which can solve many of the problems we face. Your contribution will get you a little chunk of EPIC (and the recipe to make more). I believe it may even help our planet, and our kids who will see the future we are making.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><b>We need funding to:</b></p>
<p>Create multi-lingual high quality training materials (DVDs, books, etc) so that everyone can start making EPIC in their own towns, and convert tons of waste EPS and paper into useful stuff</p>
<p>Develop and produce low cost EPS grinding equipment for small scale EPIC production at the local level.</p>
<p>Have professional engineering tests done on various EPIC mixes to see what the exact properties are. This is the first step towards getting EPIC approved for use in metropolitan areas with stringent building codes.<br/></p>
<b>What you'll get:
</b><ul>
<li>The basic formula for EPIC - This ""formula"" is actually more of a philosophy, with reasoning and ""rules"" which guide you to a happier outcome. And like any good philosophy it shows you why, not just how to make EPIC, as different applications require different approaches.<br/>
</li>
<li>Sample block of EPIC (doubles as a snazzy drink coaster) Available in sets!<br/>
</li>
<li>A complete kit with all the materials you need to make EPIC (just add drill!)<br/>
</li>
<li>Grinding machinery for making EPS into beads</li>
<li>Training sessions and technical support for your project</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will use the funds donated to create MORE stuff like EPIC<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>EPIC is a revolutionary new material. How it gets used is up to you! I can think of many ways to use it but the sky's the limit. Super efficient and affordable housing, off-grid commercial aquaponic systems, raised bed gardens, furniture, the possibilities are nearly endless. The domes we have built so far have been <b>torture tested with sledgehammers and propane torches, termites and freeze/thaw cycles. </b>All tests passed with flying colors. Buildings have been cut up with chain saws, <i>moved</i>, and reassembled again! EPIC joins to EPIC perfectly... using EPIC for the ""glue"".<br/></p>
<p>EPIC is a <b>ZERO WASTE</b> product.

 What the heck can we do about ""Styrofoam""? (expanded polystyrene or ""EPS"") Many recycling experts have tried to solve this problem and FAILED because EPS is costly to ship and much of it is food-contaminated.  When they do recycle EPS, it ends up as low-grade plastic (polystyrene).  Because that material has little value, it doesn't make economic sense to ship EPS to recycling facilities (which are few and far between).  Even though EPS is technically recyclable, most of it ends up in landfills, if not our streets, rivers, and even the ocean. 
Let's just BAN it, right?    Well... it turns out that banning EPS doesn't help the environment, it arguably makes things worse.  EPS replacements cost a lot more, require far more water and energy to make, and many/most of them are not recyclable or compostable. We need a radically different approach.
By processing EPS and paper into composites using local, low-tech 
methods, all the EPS from your neighborhood can be turned into highly useful products. So the world is cleaner, we save energy and landfill
 space, and the money saved can be spent on better things. 
Who is Dave Pennington anyway?
I am an eco-artist/inventor (some say alchemist) currently living in Dallas TX. Trained at the University of the Virgin Islands as an aquaponic systems designer, I currently work as an aquaponic farmer and in the process of optimizing that concept I developed several eco-inventions, mostly focused on energy management. I needed insulated tilapia tanks, so I came up with an ""EPIC"" invention. As with aquaponics, the future was waiting... in the past. I figured out how to combine EPS (invented in the 1950's) with ""papercrete"" (invented in the 1920's) and the results have been AMAZING. Now instead of $3/gallon, large format insulated tanks only cost 30 cents per gallon, which is an order of magnitude less expensive. The same material can be used to build tornado resistant buildings for less than $10/sq ft.
With your help I will be able to spread this eco-technology far and wide, and build more solutions to the world's pressing ecological problems. The first order of business will be to start producing a line of simple and affordable machines for grinding and bagging EPS. At the same time a multi-lingual DVD showing how to make EPIC will be produced for mass distribution. Finally a learning portal needs to be created where people from all over the world can learn how to build food systems, house their families, and even solve the climate crisis using EPIC and other inventions. We can make all this happen.
I am currently working with a bunch of very sharp people who are doing some seriously interesting projects which unfortunately I can't talk  about yet. They have seen EPIC and other advances I have made, and they want to put me to work solving more problems, all related to the health of humanity and our planet. I have some ideas how to put their expertise to work. Think floating islands for coral reef restoration...!?! 
Please chip in a bit and help the project along, we are working as hard as we can because there is a great need for solutions, and luckily some great innovations are being developed which can solve many of the problems we face. Your contribution will get you a little chunk of EPIC (and the recipe to make more). I believe it may even help our planet, and our kids who will see the future we are making.
  What We Need & What You Get We need funding to:
Create multi-lingual high quality training materials (DVDs, books, etc) so that everyone can start making EPIC in their own towns, and convert tons of waste EPS and paper into useful stuff
Develop and produce low cost EPS grinding equipment for small scale EPIC production at the local level.
Have professional engineering tests done on various EPIC mixes to see what the exact properties are. This is the first step towards getting EPIC approved for use in metropolitan areas with stringent building codes.
What you'll get:

The basic formula for EPIC - This ""formula"" is actually more of a philosophy, with reasoning and ""rules"" which guide you to a happier outcome. And like any good philosophy it shows you why, not just how to make EPIC, as different applications require different approaches.

Sample block of EPIC (doubles as a snazzy drink coaster) Available in sets!

A complete kit with all the materials you need to make EPIC (just add drill!)

Grinding machinery for making EPS into beads
Training sessions and technical support for your project

If we don't reach our goal, we will use the funds donated to create MORE stuff like EPIC
  The Impact EPIC is a revolutionary new material. How it gets used is up to you! I can think of many ways to use it but the sky's the limit. Super efficient and affordable housing, off-grid commercial aquaponic systems, raised bed gardens, furniture, the possibilities are nearly endless. The domes we have built so far have been torture tested with sledgehammers and propane torches, termites and freeze/thaw cycles. All tests passed with flying colors. Buildings have been cut up with chain saws, moved, and reassembled again! EPIC joins to EPIC perfectly... using EPIC for the ""glue"".
EPIC is a ZERO WASTE product. Everything you make with it, and all the scraps, can be ground up and mixed into more EPIC.  You can build your project and NOTHING needs to go in the trash. When an EPIC creation outlives its usefulness, just grind it up and make it into something new!
  Risks & ChallengesThe risk to our planet is all that concerns me. I have already developed the technology you see here, so sending you the samples, the instructions, the consulting materials, that will happen unless I get hit by a bus. The challenge as I see it is how do we get this technology applied fast enough to make a real difference. I have a lot of ideas how to do that, and as you may have noticed my ideas tend to be a little bit outside the box. To heck with the box.NOTE: EPIC is a new construction material. If you want to build a house out of EPIC and you live in an area where building codes require specific materials, you may need to move to an area with greater architectural freedom.

<p>Hello everyone!  My name is Andrew Sneddon and I am the
proud owner and founder of Coastal Playground®. Over the past 5 years I have
been developing a business model that I think you'll really dig, especially
for you beach lovers out there.  <b>We've been told we're the TOM's Shoes of
the surf industry. </b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463861724/photo_4_apzbtt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You see, over years of surfing Southern California
waters, one thing has become painfully obvious. <b>POLLUTION is everywhere!!</b> In
the line-up, on the sand, in our harbors, you almost can't take a trip to the
beach anymore without coming across a handful of garbage marring the beautiful
scenery we've come to love and enjoy. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464374417/image_1_furqfs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Not sure about all of you, but I am
tired of it, and instead of complaining, I decided to roll up my
sleeves and go to work. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463861745/sned_ueyatu.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p>And with that, Coastal Playground 50/50® was born; <b>With
every product you purchase, 50% of the proceeds will go towards beach
cleanups.</b><b style=""font-style: italic;""> </b></p>
<p>I have two daughters and there was no way I was going to let
this continue. I couldn't imagine having to tell them one day, ""Sorry hun,
the pollution is just too bad today, we can't go surf tomorrow morning.""
It seriously kills me just thinking about it. Who wants to play helicopter parent in fear of the dangers that could
be lurking in the sand? Not me! </p><h1>

</h4><p>Removing this amount of trash month after month takes a serious amount of supplies, especially when the volunteer count is consistently growing. <b>Our goal with this campaign is to raise the money necessary to purchase all the equipment needed to start 3 more monthly beach cleanups. </b> And, also provide additional supplies to our Huntington Beach and New York cleanups to ensure they keep operating smoothly for years to come.  Currently in our shop we donate 50% of the proceeds to our 50/50 partners.  With this campaign 100% of the earnings will go towards jump starting the expansion of our beach cleanup project and really help us increase our impact with these additional monthly cleanups.</p><p style=""display: inline !important;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463869496/PERKS_fk7rgt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>

</h3><p>The first of the three new monthly beach cleanups will start June or July in Seal Beach, CA.  Then the next month South Orange County.  And finally, the third will begin in Oahu, Hawaii in the month of August or September.  This will give us plenty of time to train new coordinators, secure partnerships with non-profits operating in the community, and obtain connections needed for a good volunteer base.  </p><p>Our current goal would provide us with enough money to fulfill all of the perks and the funds necessary to purchase supplies for <b>3 new monthly beach cleanups</b>. If for any reason we do not hit our goal we will use the funds to start as many cleanups as possible with the money raised.

PROPOSED NEW LOCATIONS:
SEAL BEACH, CALIFORNIA
SAN CLEMENTE, CALIFORNIA

NEXT BEACH CLEANUP: 07.09.2016

LEARN MORE ABOUT COASTAL PLAYGROUNDINTRODUCTION
Hello everyone!  My name is Andrew Sneddon and I am the
proud owner and founder of Coastal Playground®. Over the past 5 years I have
been developing a business model that I think you'll really dig, especially
for you beach lovers out there.  We've been told we're the TOM's Shoes of
the surf industry. 
You see, over years of surfing Southern California
waters, one thing has become painfully obvious. POLLUTION is everywhere!! In
the line-up, on the sand, in our harbors, you almost can't take a trip to the
beach anymore without coming across a handful of garbage marring the beautiful
scenery we've come to love and enjoy. Not sure about all of you, but I am
tired of it, and instead of complaining, I decided to roll up my
sleeves and go to work. 
And with that, Coastal Playground 50/50® was born; With
every product you purchase, 50% of the proceeds will go towards beach
cleanups. 
I have two daughters and there was no way I was going to let
this continue. I couldn't imagine having to tell them one day, ""Sorry hun,
the pollution is just too bad today, we can't go surf tomorrow morning.""
It seriously kills me just thinking about it. Who wants to play helicopter parent in fear of the dangers that could
be lurking in the sand? Not me! 

WHAT WE NEED


Our Goal = $7500
Indiegogo Percentage = %5 *plus tax & PayPal fees
Backers Needed = 150 @ an $81 average 
Removing this amount of trash month after month takes a serious amount of supplies, especially when the volunteer count is consistently growing. Our goal with this campaign is to raise the money necessary to purchase all the equipment needed to start 3 more monthly beach cleanups.  And, also provide additional supplies to our Huntington Beach and New York cleanups to ensure they keep operating smoothly for years to come.  Currently in our shop we donate 50% of the proceeds to our 50/50 partners.  With this campaign 100% of the earnings will go towards jump starting the expansion of our beach cleanup project and really help us increase our impact with these additional monthly cleanups.
1 Ez-Up = $350 
Table = $25
Gloves = $30
Trash Pickers = $85
Reusable Bags = $32
1 Fish Scale = $15
Total Cost = $537 x 3 NEW Monthly Beach Cleanups = $1611 (After cost of production, shipping, & fees for the perks, we will have around $1750.00 remaining)
The first of the three new monthly beach cleanups will start June or July in Seal Beach, CA.  Then the next month South Orange County.  And finally, the third will begin in Oahu, Hawaii in the month of August or September.  This will give us plenty of time to train new coordinators, secure partnerships with non-profits operating in the community, and obtain connections needed for a good volunteer base.  Our current goal would provide us with enough money to fulfill all of the perks and the funds necessary to purchase supplies for 3 new monthly beach cleanups. If for any reason we do not hit our goal we will use the funds to start as many cleanups as possible with the money raised. If we surpass our goal, or receive a large percentage of donations we will use the additional funds to start a 4th monthly cleanup. PERKSAll of the perks we will be providing are made in the USA and printed locally in Los Angeles, CA. We use organic cottons, eco-friendly printing processes, and deliver a quality products that will not only help us make a huge impact but will also help you reduce your footprint in style.

We must learn how to meet more of our needs (which, after all, is the purpose of an economy) without relying on the inequalities and destructiveness of the current world order.

[…] I think (the nuclear crisis in) Fukushima has given us an opportunity to deeply consider whether the changes we need to make are simply reorienting consumerism, or more fundamental, like asking “What kind of world do I want to be living in, and what kind of life do I want to have for my children?”  </i></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>- </span></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Andy Couturier</span></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">________________________________________________________________</p><h3><strong>The Call for Systemic Change </strong></h3><p>We have identified Couturier’s book as one of the top sustainability reads of this decade, en par with if not more important than E.F. Schumacher’s <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1117634.Small_Is_Beautiful"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Small is Beautiful</a>. It does not remain to be postindustrial theory, but shows with real life examples how we can deal with the scarecrows of economic recession, unemployment and lack of intrinsic motivation.</p><p>Leading environmentalist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_McKibben"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bill McKibben</a>, who wrote the foreword to the new edition of Schumacher’s classic, says about The Abundance of Less: <i>We are in an overheated world--physically and spiritually. It is extremely powerful to read of people who have managed to escape that world, not by traveling to outer space but by heading toward reality. This is subversive in the best possible way. </i></p><p>Our work is based on the conviction that an economic transformation towards sustainable models of growth must happen above all in China, which has in so many regards already taken over control of this spaceship, our earth. We believe that talking to Chinese in China about Couturier’s book will catalyze a critical understanding of the present-day consumption behavior, which is most dramatically reflected in the stellar rise of Chinese <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singles_Day"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Single’s Day</a>, the world’s largest offline and online shopping day. It is increased consumption by which we compensate for our discontent with modern civilization and urban alienation.</p><p>It is not our intention to criticize China, but to avoid or aggravate mistakes which have already been made by other economies which have been on their journey of modernization for much longer. We want to facilitate a global dialogue beyond political and economic borders, share best practices and align our efforts in creating a safe and sound future for all our children, wherever they are born. </p><p>Our economies, whether those many 19th and 20th century national economies we are part of, or this one global economy which has come into existence during the last few decades, are like giant ocean vessels: the larger they are the more difficult they are to manoeuvre, the longer it takes to change their course.</p><p>Scientists tell us that this course is one of environmental and ultimately self-destruction, and many agree that we have about 20 years left to change direction before we reach a tipping point of no return; a point when climate change causes sea levels to rise, precipitation cycles to quicken, precipitation volumes and storm frequency to drastically increase.</p><p><strong><a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/alice_bows_larkin_we_re_too_late_to_prevent_climate_change_here_s_how_we_adapt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ALICE BOWS-LARKIN on climate change</a></strong></p><p>Despite this overwhelming scientific evidence and despite a growing number of people being aware that we are heading in the wrong direction, the vast majority of humankind fears an economic recession, because it is associated with unemployment on a massive scale, explosive inflation, increasing poverty and ultimately war. Keeping inflation low has become the magic trick of conservative post WWII central bankers who know how to read their respective societies’ financial, but fail to understand or ignore the social indicators.</p><p>We have been brainwashed for generations by Keynes and his disciples that economic growth is the only formula to wealth and well-being. We have adapted all our institutions and corporations to the dogma that size matters, and we have overheard the gospel of post-industrial economists like E.F. Schumacher who said already in the early 1970s that small is beautiful and that we need to value the irreplaceable capital which man has not made, but simply found, i.e. the earth’s natural resources.</p><p>Postindustrial thinking has produced the ideas of a resource based or circular economy, i.e. an alternative to an industrial, linear and ultimately destructive system of production. Yet, this body of thought has not managed to resolve the recession stigma, which by sheer terminology implies less than before.</p><p><strong><a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/dame_ellen_macarthur_the_surprising_thing_i_learned_sailing_solo_around_the_world"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ELLEN MCARTHUR on the circular economy</a></strong></p><p>While most of the Western world is in the grip of fear of losing its material wealth, the industrial revolution and globalization have spread Western models of growth like an epidemic: breakneck urbanization, heavy capital investments, mass production, centralized development planning and advanced technology are elements of economic policy which all developing nations apply; in recent years camouflaged as a global rat race amongst knowledge economies.</p><p>It is above all India and China, the globe’s most populous nations, each of them inhabited by about three times more people than the EU and five times more than the US, which bring new urgency to a need for economic transformation. But it is exactly these two continent-like and relatively young nation states which are driven by the humiliation through the European scientific revolution to design their economic systems despite their avert dissatisfaction with Western hegemony in the same model.</p><p>In particular China has embarked on an unprecedented modernization trajectory. Urbanization rates have surpassed 50% in 2013 and all social structures including the labor markets are on a fast forward reorganization which is only comparable to what started in Europe during the second industrial revolution at the beginning of the 20th century, i.e. when electricity swept over businesses like a thunderstorm leaving no brick on another.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">________________________________________________________________</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>""Many problems in the world cannot be solved by personal choice alone.

We are all part of larger social transformations, which demand to a certain degree being part of urbanized consumer societies. How can we regain our own momentum and build up torque?</p><p>A recession in national economies and the global industrial economy does not necessarily mean that humanity ends up in poverty. A recession in the industrial economy needs to be understood as a reduction of material wealth and profit to a minimum necessity. A reduction in material affluence must be embraced as the only possibility for a wealth in general well-being, that includes all of humanity and the Earth as a living ecosystem.</p><p>The German philosopher David Reinhard Precht tells us that the focus of modern societies on material wealth blocks spiritual well-being. It is in particular the exponential modernization of Chinese public transportation, which exemplifies how technocratic capitalism can accelerate a society's material progress. Many notice though that a progress in hardware must be balanced with an upgraded software. High tech infrastructure must be matched with a corresponding, moral (or if you prefer spiritual) value system. China gains rapidly ground in the first, but an increasing number of people feel emptiness in the latter.</p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/china-beipan-river-bridge-high-speed-railway-2015-11"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TECHINSIDER VIDEO on China's high speed rail</a></strong></p><p>As this spiritual void opens up ever wider, president Xi Jinping has launched in 2013 the socialist core value campaign, which tries to revive traditional Chinese religions, in particular Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism, as a counter measure. Ian Johnson writes in his book The Souls of China, that <i>religion provides a morality and frames of reference for universal aspirations—like justice, fairness, and decency—that are higher than any government’s agenda. Out of this is coming a China that is more than the hyper-mercantilist, fragile superpower that we know. It is a country engaging in a global conversation that affects all of us: how to restore solidarity and values to societies that have made economics the basis of most decisions. Perhaps because Chinese traditions were so savagely attacked over the past decades, and then replaced with such a naked form of capitalism, China might actually be at the forefront of this worldwide search for values.</i></p><p>A campaign which focuses on the resurrection of an ancient value system without changing the overlying economic system makes it almost impossible to truly harvest the promised changes: individual lives continue to be subjected to socialist capitalism and thus consumerism; they remain tiny sprockets in a giant clockwork which drives the largest economic flywheel humanity has ever seen.</p><p>Alternative models of lifestyle are therefore fervently sought after and have generated in China during the last decade a <a href=""http://popupchinese.com/lessons/sinica/who-will-save-us-from-the-self-help-revolution"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">self-help market</a> in similar size to the US, but like the government ordained renewal of traditional Chinese values, all these teachings remain to be subject to a linear industrial economy.  <a href=""https://aeon.co/videos/why-some-chinese-millennials-are-taking-up-the-hermit-s-life-in-the-mountains"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aeon Magazine</a> recently published a beautiful video about a few Chinese millennials who have chosen a different path of seeking satisfaction beyond money in the simplicity of rural China.

Together, let’s cultivate a critical understanding of todays increasing consumption patterns by which we use to compensate for our discontent with modern civilization and urban alienation. This campaign will support a three-week tour with Andy Couturtier during the late spring of 2018 in major Chinese cities including Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Beijing. We will discuss the life and teachings of ten Japanese individuals, whose ways of life points humanity in a direction of greater sustainability and satisfaction. Couturier inspires with the message to seek an abundance in well-being and self-sufficiency to grow away from the loop of materialism in our industrial economies. Listen to Couturier speak at the Commonwealth Club here. The MissionThe campaign's mission is to facilitate a dialogue about sustainable modes of living and to foster an understanding of how each one of us can reduce the negative impact upon this planet. We need to recognize our common home and open our consciousness to the very plain fact, that it is only through collaboration and cooperation we will be able to resolve the challenges ahead - whether it is between China and the US, Europe and India, them and us, or between you and me.We want to avoid mistakes which have already been made by other economies who have been on their journey of modernization for much longer. We want to grow a global dialogue beyond political and economic borders, share best practices, and align our efforts in creating a safe and sound future for all our children, wherever they are born.We must learn from each other and with each other.________________________________________________________________""Certainly, there is something fundamentally modern in being able to choose different aspects of a way of life and put them together in a manner that makes sense to you. But what gets people in our society paralyzed sometimes is that there are so many options available, and we don’t have the internal fiber to make choices on a consistent and strongly held set of principles and values. We must learn how to meet more of our needs (which, after all, is the purpose of an economy) without relying on the inequalities and destructiveness of the current world order. Can we make the process of thinking and experimenting our way out of our dilemma an opportunity, a chance to build our values and characters? We could then use our minds to create a library of techniques that will make life better for ourselves, and for everyone. But whatever form it takes, it does require change."" -Andy Couturier________________________________________________________________The ProjectCouturier will tour with Green Initiatives in the late spring of 2018 for three weeks Shanghai, Hangzhou, Beijing and other major Chinese cities, where we will host moderated book readings and podium discussions in cooperation with resident environmental activists.The aim is to create a dialogue in China on the future of humanity as parallel to Couturier’s message in the Abundance of Less. Couturier’s book catalyzes a critical understanding of the increasing consumption behaviors found today which we use to compensate for our discontent with modern civilization and urban alienation.​Will we continue to concentrate on consumption driven urban agglomerations or will rural and decentralized self-sufficiency turn out to be a genuine alternative?The entire campaign will be documented with a photo and video blog, which we make available to a global online audience. We believe that there is considerable interest in how Chinese consumers think about the future of our planet and what they want to do about the environmental degradation which is currently most prevalent in their own country. At the end of the campaign, a campaign summary will be produced. ________________________________________________________________""We need to take a pause, a significant pause, to create a strategy and plan for the change to a slower, richer life. When we are maxed out, we slide into the way the system is already structured, the easiest way to do things. ""-Andy Couturier________________________________________________________________The BudgetThe single biggest risk to this project is financing it. We have calculated a required budget of approximately $15,000 USD (or ¥100,700 CNY) for travel expenses, accommodation, translation, and event organization for the total duration of 25 days.You can also contribute using local China-based payments incl. WeChat, AliPay, and Union Pay through Yoopay - please scan QR code below.  As of February 26, 2018, ¥2,250 has been raised on Yoopay!This is a nonprofit campaign and we will provide complete transparency of all project income and expenses on our website, including a weekly fundraising summary.The TeamAndy, Cynthia, Nitin, KnutAndy is an essayist, poet and writing teacher. He lived in Japan for 4 years, where he taught, was a journalist, and worked on environmental causes. His first book is Writing Open the Mind and he has written for The Japan Times, Adbusters, The North American Review, Kyoto Journal, and The Oakland Tribune. He is the director of The Opening, a center for courses in writing.Cynthia is the chief editor for The Abundance of Less. As the Couturier's partner, she consulted all aspects of the design, story development, photo selection, translation decision, interviews, and was an utterly reliable source of wise counsel over the thousands of decisions it takes to create a book. Cynthia will continue to coach Couturier before, during and after each of the planned book readings on the China tour.Nitin is the founder and director of Green Initiatives, a Shanghai based nonprofit which collects and shares solutions for sustainable models of growth and consumption to trigger action and change behavior. Green Initiatives has a crowd of several thousand followers on our social media channels and have built a reputation for high end awareness events, action campaigns and impact projects. In his day-job he works as an architect for GIGA, an architecture firm which has developed RESET, a building standard for measuring healthy work environments.Knut helps executive management with organizational development challenges in a Far East Asian context and supports key individuals to unfold their potential with Telos Pi. He lives since 17 years on and off in China, since 2009 with his wife and two children in Shanghai. Whenever he has time and something to say, he writes on his blogs about China, the future of work and dark matter.The BackgroundJapan, for centuries, has copied China’s culture and commerce, was the most fervent disciple of Western modernization, emulating British industry, the German legal system and French bureaucratic centralization. Although Japan's industrial revolution started during the Meiji Restoration more than a century after Western Europe, it overtook the West latest in the 1990s, when its national financial crisis preceded the GFC by more than a decade.It is against this backdrop of breakneck social transformation, the abandonment of its own culture and an urbanization rate exceeding 90% that Couturier found a few Japanese individuals who have decided to wrest authority over their lives away from a global market and a national government back into their own hands.Couturier’s friends live in the Japanese countryside. There, they grow their own food and pursue what they are really interested in, whether it may be writing, playing music or working as artisans. Their lives are simple and one would say deprived of material affluence. But, by the emerging consensus on truly sustainable living, they are pioneers, showing the rest of us how to redefine wealth by being truly rich in social capital and abundant in creativity.They are models that we can follow. Couturier's profiles inspire us to leave behind the clockwork of our industrial economies. He gives these philosophers who put their thinking into action a platform to teach an important lecture humanity should collectively listen; and we will provide a platform to engage with and learn from him directly.Shanghai : a Symbol of China's Stellar RiseThe importance of reconnecting with oneself is and pursuing self-sufficiency for the greater community is evident. Within the last four decades, China has transformed into the single largest economy in terms of purchasing power - shaping the modern world like nothing ever before. It is not only the largest greenhouse gas emitter since 2007, but its growing class of affluent urban consumers exceeds already the total population of the US. The Chinese economy has been accelerating the exploitation of natural resources and the environmental degradation at an alarming rate. By recognizing our ability to be free from the trap of materialism through the pursuit of less, we can alleviate the heavy air pollution with smog carpeting the vast area between Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan. China Water Risk reports that 57% of shallow ground water and 50% of deep ground water are severely polluted and not suitable for human contact let alone drinking. China’s soil pollution receives least attention, but is the most serious cause for concern. ________________________________________________________________""So much discussion about “becoming more green” seems to promise us that if we only make lifestyle tweaks, drive more efficient cars and install more and better solar panels, we can feel good about ourselves, keep our cushiness, and call it “sustainability.” But in the back of our minds, I think we know those tiny adaptations are not going to make the difference that we need. […] I think (the nuclear crisis in) Fukushima has given us an opportunity to deeply consider whether the changes we need to make are simply reorienting consumerism, or more fundamental, like asking “What kind of world do I want to be living in, and what kind of life do I want to have for my children?”  - Andy Couturier________________________________________________________________The Call for Systemic Change We have identified Couturier’s book as one of the top sustainability reads of this decade, en par with if not more important than E.F. Schumacher’s Small is Beautiful. It does not remain to be postindustrial theory, but shows with real life examples how we can deal with the scarecrows of economic recession, unemployment and lack of intrinsic motivation.Leading environmentalist Bill McKibben, who wrote the foreword to the new edition of Schumacher’s classic, says about The Abundance of Less: We are in an overheated world--physically and spiritually. It is extremely powerful to read of people who have managed to escape that world, not by traveling to outer space but by heading toward reality. This is subversive in the best possible way. Our work is based on the conviction that an economic transformation towards sustainable models of growth must happen above all in China, which has in so many regards already taken over control of this spaceship, our earth. We believe that talking to Chinese in China about Couturier’s book will catalyze a critical understanding of the present-day consumption behavior, which is most dramatically reflected in the stellar rise of Chinese Single’s Day, the world’s largest offline and online shopping day. It is increased consumption by which we compensate for our discontent with modern civilization and urban alienation.It is not our intention to criticize China, but to avoid or aggravate mistakes which have already been made by other economies which have been on their journey of modernization for much longer. We want to facilitate a global dialogue beyond political and economic borders, share best practices and align our efforts in creating a safe and sound future for all our children, wherever they are born. Our economies, whether those many 19th and 20th century national economies we are part of, or this one global economy which has come into existence during the last few decades, are like giant ocean vessels: the larger they are the more difficult they are to manoeuvre, the longer it takes to change their course.Scientists tell us that this course is one of environmental and ultimately self-destruction, and many agree that we have about 20 years left to change direction before we reach a tipping point of no return; a point when climate change causes sea levels to rise, precipitation cycles to quicken, precipitation volumes and storm frequency to drastically increase.ALICE BOWS-LARKIN on climate changeDespite this overwhelming scientific evidence and despite a growing number of people being aware that we are heading in the wrong direction, the vast majority of humankind fears an economic recession, because it is associated with unemployment on a massive scale, explosive inflation, increasing poverty and ultimately war. Keeping inflation low has become the magic trick of conservative post WWII central bankers who know how to read their respective societies’ financial, but fail to understand or ignore the social indicators.We have been brainwashed for generations by Keynes and his disciples that economic growth is the only formula to wealth and well-being. We have adapted all our institutions and corporations to the dogma that size matters, and we have overheard the gospel of post-industrial economists like E.F. Schumacher who said already in the early 1970s that small is beautiful and that we need to value the irreplaceable capital which man has not made, but simply found, i.e. the earth’s natural resources.Postindustrial thinking has produced the ideas of a resource based or circular economy, i.e. an alternative to an industrial, linear and ultimately destructive system of production. Yet, this body of thought has not managed to resolve the recession stigma, which by sheer terminology implies less than before.ELLEN MCARTHUR on the circular economyWhile most of the Western world is in the grip of fear of losing its material wealth, the industrial revolution and globalization have spread Western models of growth like an epidemic: breakneck urbanization, heavy capital investments, mass production, centralized development planning and advanced technology are elements of economic policy which all developing nations apply; in recent years camouflaged as a global rat race amongst knowledge economies.It is above all India and China, the globe’s most populous nations, each of them inhabited by about three times more people than the EU and five times more than the US, which bring new urgency to a need for economic transformation. But it is exactly these two continent-like and relatively young nation states which are driven by the humiliation through the European scientific revolution to design their economic systems despite their avert dissatisfaction with Western hegemony in the same model.In particular China has embarked on an unprecedented modernization trajectory. Urbanization rates have surpassed 50% in 2013 and all social structures including the labor markets are on a fast forward reorganization which is only comparable to what started in Europe during the second industrial revolution at the beginning of the 20th century, i.e. when electricity swept over businesses like a thunderstorm leaving no brick on another.________________________________________________________________""Many problems in the world cannot be solved by personal choice alone. In this book, it was important to me to emphasize all the social action that people in Japan are taking, locally and nationally. The culture of individualism in the West encourages us to blame ourselves for problems that are created by our society and economic system. I wouldn’t want this book to reinforce that way of thinking. If you are rushed, hectic, disconnected, driving too much, is that all your personal fault? I don’t think so. ""- Andy Couturier________________________________________________________________If each national economic system were a giant clockwork and each one of us a tiny cogwheel in that machine, it would be impossible to reduce revolution let alone change direction. We are all part of larger social transformations, which demand to a certain degree being part of urbanized consumer societies. How can we regain our own momentum and build up torque?A recession in national economies and the global industrial economy does not necessarily mean that humanity ends up in poverty. A recession in the industrial economy needs to be understood as a reduction of material wealth and profit to a minimum necessity. A reduction in material affluence must be embraced as the only possibility for a wealth in general well-being, that includes all of humanity and the Earth as a living ecosystem.The German philosopher David Reinhard Precht tells us that the focus of modern societies on material wealth blocks spiritual well-being. It is in particular the exponential modernization of Chinese public transportation, which exemplifies how technocratic capitalism can accelerate a society's material progress. Many notice though that a progress in hardware must be balanced with an upgraded software. High tech infrastructure must be matched with a corresponding, moral (or if you prefer spiritual) value system. China gains rapidly ground in the first, but an increasing number of people feel emptiness in the latter.TECHINSIDER VIDEO on China's high speed railAs this spiritual void opens up ever wider, president Xi Jinping has launched in 2013 the socialist core value campaign, which tries to revive traditional Chinese religions, in particular Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism, as a counter measure. Ian Johnson writes in his book The Souls of China, that religion provides a morality and frames of reference for universal aspirations—like justice, fairness, and decency—that are higher than any government’s agenda. Out of this is coming a China that is more than the hyper-mercantilist, fragile superpower that we know. It is a country engaging in a global conversation that affects all of us: how to restore solidarity and values to societies that have made economics the basis of most decisions. Perhaps because Chinese traditions were so savagely attacked over the past decades, and then replaced with such a naked form of capitalism, China might actually be at the forefront of this worldwide search for values.A campaign which focuses on the resurrection of an ancient value system without changing the overlying economic system makes it almost impossible to truly harvest the promised changes: individual lives continue to be subjected to socialist capitalism and thus consumerism; they remain tiny sprockets in a giant clockwork which drives the largest economic flywheel humanity has ever seen.Alternative models of lifestyle are therefore fervently sought after and have generated in China during the last decade a self-help market in similar size to the US, but like the government ordained renewal of traditional Chinese values, all these teachings remain to be subject to a linear industrial economy.  Aeon Magazine recently published a beautiful video about a few Chinese millennials who have chosen a different path of seeking satisfaction beyond money in the simplicity of rural China. An increasing number of young Western people leave urban areas and move to the countryside for farming and Andy provides the blueprint for why they do it by translating the wisdom of his sage-like Japanese friends into an empathy for all human and non-human life. The Abundance of Less can help us understand their underlying motivations.________________________________________________________________""What is the good life? To many it’s a code word for high-end design, gourmet food, and a red convertible. And so on. To others it’s narrowly defined as total rural food self-sufficiency. For Cynthia and me, it’s an everyday negotiation with the world as it is, a negotiation that must include a continual returning to our values, and a reexamination of whether we are holding to them as strongly as we are able to. It’s also about how we relate to others, both in our daily life but also to others in faraway parts of the planet who suffer from the waste churned out by the affluence of the industrialized world."" -Andy Couturier________________________________________________________________Additional Readings

Quiénes realmente me conocen, saben que desde niño he tenido como pasión el paisaje natural venezolano y toda su biodiversidad. Aunque no lo crean, mi primera opción para convertirme en profesional fue buscando trabajo como Guarda Parques en el sistema de Parques Nacionales de Venezuela, pero por diferentes razones nunca se cumplió ese sueño. Luego de todos estos años estoy decidido a realizarlo. Ha surgido una oportunidad para trabajar en pro de la defensa y conservación de nuestra asombrosa naturaleza. Recientemente mi hijo Tomás, quien comparte esta misma inquietud y yo, nos unimos al equipo de la Fundación para la Conservación de Biodiversidad: <strong>PROBIODIVERSA</strong>, quienes vienen desarrollando proyectos interesantes acerca de nuestra diversidad biológica, a través de producciones audiovisuales de calidad para darle promoción a uno de nuestros mayores atributos como país: su <strong>Megadiversidad</strong>. </p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> ¿Sabían ustedes que Venezuela es uno de los 17 países con mayor Biodiversidad de todo el Planeta, y son llamados MEGADIVERSOS?</h3><p> </p><p>La <strong>Cordillera de Los Andes de Mérida en Venezuela</strong>, pertenece a la <strong>Ecorregión de Los Andes Tropicales</strong>, y es el ecosistema con la mayor biodiversidad de todo el planeta tierra.  Éste Estado forma parte de la cadena montañosa más extensa del mundo, la cual nos aporta gran parte del agua que consumimos así como del oxígeno limpio que respiramos.

Quiénes realmente me conocen, saben que desde niño he tenido como pasión el paisaje natural venezolano y toda su biodiversidad. Aunque no lo crean, mi primera opción para convertirme en profesional fue buscando trabajo como Guarda Parques en el sistema de Parques Nacionales de Venezuela, pero por diferentes razones nunca se cumplió ese sueño. Luego de todos estos años estoy decidido a realizarlo. Ha surgido una oportunidad para trabajar en pro de la defensa y conservación de nuestra asombrosa naturaleza. Recientemente mi hijo Tomás, quien comparte esta misma inquietud y yo, nos unimos al equipo de la Fundación para la Conservación de Biodiversidad: PROBIODIVERSA, quienes vienen desarrollando proyectos interesantes acerca de nuestra diversidad biológica, a través de producciones audiovisuales de calidad para darle promoción a uno de nuestros mayores atributos como país: su Megadiversidad.   ¿Sabían ustedes que Venezuela es uno de los 17 países con mayor Biodiversidad de todo el Planeta, y son llamados MEGADIVERSOS? La Cordillera de Los Andes de Mérida en Venezuela, pertenece a la Ecorregión de Los Andes Tropicales, y es el ecosistema con la mayor biodiversidad de todo el planeta tierra.  Éste Estado forma parte de la cadena montañosa más extensa del mundo, la cual nos aporta gran parte del agua que consumimos así como del oxígeno limpio que respiramos. Uno de los problemas ambientales que ha suscitado mayor interés mundial en esta década es la pérdida de biodiversidad como consecuencia de las actividades humanas, ya sea de manera directa o indirecta, y nuestros andes venezolanos no escapan de esta realidad a cualquier escala ecológica.  Queremos compartir con los venezolanos y con todo aquel consciente de la importancia de la conservación, una historia que fortalecerá el sentimiento de pertenencia por nuestro país a través de su naturaleza. Renny Ottolina sabiamente dijo: ¿Cómo se ama al país si no se le respeta?, ¿Cómo se le respeta si no se le admira? Y ¿Cómo se le admira si no se le conoce?  Como persona ligada a los medios por tantos años, conozco y estoy convencido, que las artes visuales son una potente estrategia para la sensibilización y educación de la sociedad en cualquier tema. Es por ello que a través de piezas audiovisuales y otras acciones, generaremos un mensaje de consciencia para la conservación del ambiente. En este caso específico, acerca de una especie endémica y desconocida en nuestro país que está en peligro crítico de extinción.Se trata de:  El Venado de Cola Blanca de Páramo llamado científicamente Odocoileus lasiotis, habita de forma exclusiva en ambientes abiertos de páramo del Estado Mérida por encima de 3.000 metros de altura sobre el nivel del mar (ver mapa de distribución debajo).  ¿Sabían que este Venado solamente se encuentra en  algunos páramos del estado Mérida? Es la historia de una especie de Venado de Cola Blanca que evolucionó al menos unos 400 mil años separada de cualquier otra población de venados de cola blanca debido al aislamiento geográfico que tuvieron por el crecimiento de la cadena montañosa de los Andes, quedando confinados exclusivamente a los ambientes de páramo del estado Mérida por encima de los 3.000 m.s.n.m. Este venado es de tamaño mediano, mide entre 90 cm y 1,5 m de longitud, tiene un peso que varía desde los 50Kg hasta los 70 Kg. A diferencia de otros venados, el Venado de Cola Blanca de Páramo posee el pelaje mucho más denso y largo, una inconfundible coloración gris oscura, con tonos pardos en casi todo el cuerpo y presenta el típico manchado blanco en la parte central y posterior del vientre que continúa hasta los glúteos y la parte inferior de la cola. Un estudio realizado hace casi 20 años, arrojó datos preliminares sobre su población: alrededor de 240 ejemplares en vida silvestre. Hoy en día no se tienen datos censuales ni de distribución pero se teme una reducción importante del número de ejemplares. En estas dos fotografías se pueden observar algunas de las notables diferencias físicas de dos especies de venado de cola blanca de Venezuela (a la izquierda, la especie de Venado de Cola Blanca de Páramo Odocoileus lasiotis y a la derecha, la especie de Venado de Cola Blanca de las tierras bajas Odocoileus virginanus) Los dos principales problemas que han llevado a este venado al borde de la extinción son: la depredación por parte de perros cimarrones (perros domésticos abandonados que se convierten en hábiles depredadores semisalvajes, pudiendo cazar más de 20 venados al año) seguida de la cacería furtiva que todavía se realiza sobre sus reducidas poblaciones. En este ambiente de páramo sobre los 3.000 m.s.n.m. también habitan depredadores naturales como lo son: el Puma o León de Montaña y el Oso Frontino o de Anteojos  pero ninguno de los dos son culpables de una disminución alarmante del numero de venados, al contrario, son controladores de los ejemplares enfermos y heridos manteniendo sanas las poblaciones.  ¿Quieres disfrutar e impresionarte con una muestra de los audiovisuales de PROBIODIVERSA? VISITA  WWW.PROBIODIVERSA.ORG Y NUESTRO CANAL EN  YOUTUBE: “PROBIODIVERSA CANAL”.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d39pa6axgXwhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phDFfeoCjkQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwasJWme2zQ OBJETIVOS Y METAS A CUMPLIR: El propósito de esta campaña es colectar recursos que nos permitan filmar un documental de 24 min en calidad Full HD junto a otra serie de acciones  en pro de la conservación de este hermoso Venado.  Queremos contarles una verdadera historia de supervivencia, acerca de una especie que se ha adaptado por miles de años a un ecosistema de condiciones extremas, y que actualmente a causa del ser humano, está en peligro crítico de extinción, a punto de desaparecer. Este material será transmitido por algunos canales de TV tanto regional como nacional. También será proyectado y entregado en comunidades, escuelas e instituciones educativas.La realización completa del documental constará de 7 semanas (5 de producción y 2 de post-producción) Haremos también un resumen de 12 minutos de la pieza original para ser transmitida en las principales cadenas de cine del país, previo a las películas (un espacio que actualmente está vigente para transmitir producciones nacionales independientes).
 Editaremos algunos micros audiovisuales de 1 minuto de duración como campaña de divulgación y concientización de la situación del venado a través de medios de comunicación digital y redes sociales.
 Se grabarán micros de radio sobre el venado, para su posterior difusión.
 Usaremos los resultados obtenidos como incentivo para activar un plan formal de conservación y promoción de esta especie como emblema del Estado Mérida.
Haremos visitas a escuelas y otras instituciones educativas en las comunidades adyacentes al área de páramo donde pudiera ubicarse el venado, para dar charlas y proyectar el documental como estrategia de sensibilización y conservación de la especie y el medio ambiente.
Durante estas visitas a las comunidades abordaremos el tema de la crianza, manejo y control de los perros como mascotas para evitar que siga aumentando la población de perros salvajes.
Promoveremos la redacción de una ley en el Consejo Legislativo de la ciudad de Mérida para la conservación del Venado.
Realizaremos el diseño de una valla informativa que promueva la conservación del Venado de Cola Blanca de Páramo que será colocada a orillas de la carretera del sector de Mucubají.
Realizaremos expediciones científicas dentro de la posible área de distribución del Venado (observar mapa inferior), que nos permitan determinar nuevos registros de la especie.
En la imagen de abajo pueden observar la posible distribución que debería tener el Venado dentro del Estado Mérida (polígono de color amarillo), pero es sólo en un par de lugares es donde realmente se pueden observar éstos Venados en estado silvestre (símbolos color azul turquesa) En el resto de su posible distribución (símbolos de interrogación color rojo), los Venados han dejado de verse en estado silvestre, o simplemente nunca se han realizado expediciones científicas para determinar su presencia.  A pesar de la situación social y económica que vivimos los venezolanos, el cuidado y la preservación del ambiente no deben ser olvidados! Cada día los atropellos a la naturaleza son más numerosos y es necesario generar consciencia en nuestra sociedad.  
Ayúdanos a dar comienzo a esta serie de acciones para la conservación y recuperación de este hermoso animal. Evitemos que se convierta en el primer mamífero extinto para nuestro país.

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>We are ready to build the first refuge; our elephants are waiting, we have the property and we have a great team.  Now we need you to help us make the first place in Nepal that elephants will run free during the day and rest in their corrals at night; swim in the river, be with their babies and learn to be elephants again.</p>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>This year Direct Aid built the first chain free corrals for private elephants in Sauraha Chitwan Nepal. Chain free corrals allow captive elephants to be free from their bondage of chains while they are home and not working.  We also retired our first elephants from working conditions.  A baby bull elephant, Samrat Gaj and in conjunction with Association Moey, 60 year old Lucky Kali.  Lucky Kali had spent her life in the logging industry and then in the tourist industry. Now we are ready to expand our operation to retire several more elephants.  We have 3 elephants who are partially retired but we need your support to transition them to full retirement. </p>
<p>When we retire elephants we also revitalize their caregivers (Mahouts).  We give them honor and respect in a difficult profession.  When we care for the caretakers with kindness they treat the elephants with kindness.  </p>
<p>We have a perfect location with a beautiful river running through it.  Water is a precious resource here which will now be protected by the foundation to be used by the elephants, the local children, and fishermen in permanent trust.  </p>
<p>Our goals are multifaceted. Legally acquire our current elephants living at Sapana which is a complex task but we have commitments already in place.  Legally obtain our land and have it placed in perpetual trust, and our team stands waiting! </p>
<p>Donna Marshall Founder of Direct Aid Nepal has just finished building corrals for the elephants of Sapana which will serve as the first refuge site for the elephants who reside here. We have built toys in the corrals, created a watering system for the elephants, new showers for the caretakers of the elephants, painted rooms, the buildings and a general clean up of the property that the elephants will call home until we finish the new refuge.  Ms. Marshall has been an advocate of elephants in the United States and in Nepal. This year Direct Aid Nepal provided the support to retire the first residents of the refuge, the foundation also sponsored the first foot care program at Sapana by Carol Buckley. Direct Aid Nepal will be the umbrella organization for this initial startup.  Located in the United States it is fully registered Non-Profit 501 3 c.</p>
<p>Dhruba Giri the owner of Sapana Lodge is a forward-thinking Nepalese man with humble beginnings who has come full circle from being an elephant owner for profit to a man with a vision where he sees the overall benefit from retiring elephants from the tourist industry.  He is donating over 10 acres of his property needed for the refuge; he is the face of change in Nepal.  He works tirelessly to promote education, mobile health clinics, a city-wide recycling project and now an elephant refuge.  With the generous land donation we will only need to purchase the remaining property in the area to ensure the land is only to be used for the refuge. </p>
<p>Lena Quenard founder of Assocation Moey has been working with elephants for many years in Thailand and in Nepal; she has trained with Carol Buckley in foot care and welfare care. She was the driving force behind the rescue of Lucky Kali one of our residents at Sapana.  Lucky Kali a 60+ old elephant is the first retired private elephant in Nepal.   It has been a journey for Lucky, Mrs. Quenard and her mahouts.   Mrs. Quenard has agreed to be our first Elephant Welfare Manager at our Refuge.  She is also an amazing photographer, capturing many images that helped us with our video.    </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>It will cost us $400,000 to legally secure the elephants and pay for their care in full, hiring our staff and upgrading all current elephant systems in place for the first year and to prepare the property for elephants.  It will cost us $700,000 to obtain the full property we require and to build a corral system that will be strong enough to withstand wild elephants and rhinos from entering the premises.  Baby bulls will require strong corrals and we will have them.  Next year we will plant 500 trees to give the property flavor for the elephants; providing necessary shade and food.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We will hire Local! Nepal’s youth suffers from unemployment; we need 15 to 20 people year one to come on board with us.  By year 3 we should be hiring 50 people.  As we grow the tourist industry in the area which has collapsed will start to recover.  </p>
<p>Our jobs will have a just wage; health insurance and above all respect and dignity.  </p>
<p>We will provide two scholarships each year to local youths who wish to pursue a career in Animal Care at our local college.</p>
<p>We will save the precious water here.  We will have a river warden to test and analyze the water of the river not only in our area but the entire river; monitoring usage and helping to change any behavior that is harmful to the water source.</p>
<p>We will become the center of training for mahouts; elephant caregivers in Nepal.  Here we will teach humane training. We will continue to have foot care clinics.  </p>
<p>More elephants; we will continue to evaluate the 108 private elephants in Nepal and our board will determine at least once per year which elephants should be retired from the community and then we will negotiate their retirement with the private owner with the stipulation that the elephant cannot be replaced.  We already have a list of 6 elephants that desperately need our help. Desperate is not an exaggerated word here.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute it doesn't mean you can't help!  Please help by sharing our campaign to your friends, family and workplace.  The elephants and our team need your support!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your attention!</p>
</div></div>","Project Summary
We are ready to build the first refuge; our elephants are waiting, we have the property and we have a great team.  Now we need you to help us make the first place in Nepal that elephants will run free during the day and rest in their corrals at night; swim in the river, be with their babies and learn to be elephants again.
About Us
This year Direct Aid built the first chain free corrals for private elephants in Sauraha Chitwan Nepal. Chain free corrals allow captive elephants to be free from their bondage of chains while they are home and not working.  We also retired our first elephants from working conditions.  A baby bull elephant, Samrat Gaj and in conjunction with Association Moey, 60 year old Lucky Kali.  Lucky Kali had spent her life in the logging industry and then in the tourist industry. Now we are ready to expand our operation to retire several more elephants.  We have 3 elephants who are partially retired but we need your support to transition them to full retirement. 
When we retire elephants we also revitalize their caregivers (Mahouts).  We give them honor and respect in a difficult profession.  When we care for the caretakers with kindness they treat the elephants with kindness.  
We have a perfect location with a beautiful river running through it.  Water is a precious resource here which will now be protected by the foundation to be used by the elephants, the local children, and fishermen in permanent trust.  
Our goals are multifaceted. Legally acquire our current elephants living at Sapana which is a complex task but we have commitments already in place.  Legally obtain our land and have it placed in perpetual trust, and our team stands waiting! 
Donna Marshall Founder of Direct Aid Nepal has just finished building corrals for the elephants of Sapana which will serve as the first refuge site for the elephants who reside here. We have built toys in the corrals, created a watering system for the elephants, new showers for the caretakers of the elephants, painted rooms, the buildings and a general clean up of the property that the elephants will call home until we finish the new refuge.  Ms. Marshall has been an advocate of elephants in the United States and in Nepal. This year Direct Aid Nepal provided the support to retire the first residents of the refuge, the foundation also sponsored the first foot care program at Sapana by Carol Buckley. Direct Aid Nepal will be the umbrella organization for this initial startup.  Located in the United States it is fully registered Non-Profit 501 3 c.
Dhruba Giri the owner of Sapana Lodge is a forward-thinking Nepalese man with humble beginnings who has come full circle from being an elephant owner for profit to a man with a vision where he sees the overall benefit from retiring elephants from the tourist industry.  He is donating over 10 acres of his property needed for the refuge; he is the face of change in Nepal.  He works tirelessly to promote education, mobile health clinics, a city-wide recycling project and now an elephant refuge.  With the generous land donation we will only need to purchase the remaining property in the area to ensure the land is only to be used for the refuge. 
Lena Quenard founder of Assocation Moey has been working with elephants for many years in Thailand and in Nepal; she has trained with Carol Buckley in foot care and welfare care. She was the driving force behind the rescue of Lucky Kali one of our residents at Sapana.  Lucky Kali a 60+ old elephant is the first retired private elephant in Nepal.   It has been a journey for Lucky, Mrs. Quenard and her mahouts.   Mrs. Quenard has agreed to be our first Elephant Welfare Manager at our Refuge.  She is also an amazing photographer, capturing many images that helped us with our video.    

What We Need 
It will cost us $400,000 to legally secure the elephants and pay for their care in full, hiring our staff and upgrading all current elephant systems in place for the first year and to prepare the property for elephants.  It will cost us $700,000 to obtain the full property we require and to build a corral system that will be strong enough to withstand wild elephants and rhinos from entering the premises.  Baby bulls will require strong corrals and we will have them.  Next year we will plant 500 trees to give the property flavor for the elephants; providing necessary shade and food.

The Impact
We will hire Local! Nepal’s youth suffers from unemployment; we need 15 to 20 people year one to come on board with us.  By year 3 we should be hiring 50 people.  As we grow the tourist industry in the area which has collapsed will start to recover.  
Our jobs will have a just wage; health insurance and above all respect and dignity.  
We will provide two scholarships each year to local youths who wish to pursue a career in Animal Care at our local college.
We will save the precious water here.  We will have a river warden to test and analyze the water of the river not only in our area but the entire river; monitoring usage and helping to change any behavior that is harmful to the water source.
We will become the center of training for mahouts; elephant caregivers in Nepal.  Here we will teach humane training. We will continue to have foot care clinics.  
More elephants; we will continue to evaluate the 108 private elephants in Nepal and our board will determine at least once per year which elephants should be retired from the community and then we will negotiate their retirement with the private owner with the stipulation that the elephant cannot be replaced.  We already have a list of 6 elephants that desperately need our help. Desperate is not an exaggerated word here.

The Perks and Rewards
We have several vacation packages suited for all levels!  We hope you find one that works for you!  Please contact us with any questions, we are able to make adjustments if needed.  Trips need to be completed by 18 months from the day the campaign is completed.  If you're not up for travel we also have options for donations.  You may also qualify for tax deductions.  Please note that our trips start in Nepal and do not include any International travel that may be required.  Please make sure you are eligible for travel to Nepal prior to selecting a package.

<h3>Présentation</h3>
<p>Ecolibri a pour ambition de révolutionner ta façon de consommer la nourriture à emporter à Montréal.</p>
<p>Comment ? En te proposant de remplacer les emballages à usage unique habituellement utilisés pour ce type de consommation par des contenants réutilisables. </p>
<p>Tu te demandes ce que va devenir le contenant réutilisable une fois ton repas terminé ? Il ne va sûrement pas dormir dans ton placard ! Après avoir retiré les restes de nourriture - que tu auras évidemment compostés - et rincé sommairement l'emballage, tu pourras le déposer dans un restaurant partenaire qui le lavera soigneusement et le remettra en circulation.</p>
<p>C'est le principe de l'économie circulaire. </p>
<p>Et avec les temps qui courent hors de question de manipuler de l'argent. Avec notre solution, pas de consigne ! Nous fonctionnons avec un abonnement - à venir - qui te permet d'emprunter autant de contenants que nécessaire sur la période de ton abonnement. Les boîtes en ta possession sont suivies par une application. C'est simple, intuitif et sans contact !</p>
<p>Et quand est-ce que ce beau projet sera lancé ? En janvier 2021 pour bien commencer la nouvelle année !</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Ce que nous avons et ce dont nous avons besoin pour aller plus loin</h3>
<p>Nous avons :</p>
<ul>
<li>Deux cerveaux ingénieux qui fonctionnent à plein régime</li>
<li>Un site internet et une page Instagram qui détaillent le mode de fonctionnement Ecolibri</li>
<li>Plusieurs fournisseurs prêts à participer à l'aventure</li>
<li>De nombreux restaurants motivés pour rejoindre la belle communauté Ecolibri</li>
<li>Des solutions de recyclage réelles pour les emballages en fin de vie</li>
<li>Et des milliers de consommateurs qui n'attendent que nous !</li>
</ul>
<p>Il nous faut encore :</p>
<ul>
<li>Figer notre liste de restaurants partenaires pour le lancement en janvier 2021</li>
<li>Choisir le ou les fournisseurs de contenants réutilisables parmi notre panel. Nous avons évidemment sélectionné des industries québécoises !</li>
<li>Commander une quantité de boîtes réutilisables adaptée à notre panel de restaurateurs</li>
<li>Réceptionner et répartir les emballages dans les restaurants</li>
<li>Développer une application pour réserver et restituer les boîtes</li>
<li>Et puis c'est tout !</li>
</ul>
<p>Ce qu'il nous faut pour concrétiser le projet :</p>
<ul>
<li>Avec 2 000$ soit 135 abonnements à 15$/an, nous pourrons lancer l'application et approvisionner 8 restaurants montréalais en boîtes</li>
<li>Avec 5 000$ soit 335 abonnements à 15$/an, nous pourrons lancer l'application et approvisionner 20 restaurants montréalais en boîtes</li>
<li>Avec 10 000$ soit 667 abonnements à 15$/an, nous pourrons lancer l'application et approvisionner 40 restaurants montréalais en boîtes</li>
<li>En-dessous de 2 000$, les fonds seront restitués aux participants et le projet ne verra pas le jour</li>
</ul>
<p>Nous prévoyons également d'étendre le projet dans les entreprises lors d'une phase deux pour gérer de manière durable les repas à emporter des employés qui sont consommés dans les locaux des entreprises. Et oui, nous ne nous arrêterons pas là ! Attends toi à voir une phase deux, puis trois...nos esprits bouillent d'idées !</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Comment vous pouvez nous aider</h3>
<p>En souscrivant dès à présent à un abonnement à 15$ l'année ici même, tu aides notre projet à voir le jour et tu es acteur du changement !</p>
<p>Cet abonnement te donnera le droit d'emprunter autant de contenants que nécessaire auprès de nos restaurateurs participants pendant la période de ton abonnement avec une limite de 5 contenants en simultané - et oui, il faut en garder pour tout le monde ! Ton abonnement démarrera au lancement de l'application et du projet en janvier 2021.</p>
<p>À titre informatif, les abonnements seront vendus dans l'application à partir de janvier 2021 entre 2$ et 4$ par mois soit entre 24$/an et 48$/an. Ces tarifs sont purement indicatifs et restent à confirmer.</p>

<h3>L'impact</h3>
<p>Prendre part à cette initiative est VALORISANT pour les individus.</p>
<p>Nous essayons tous de faire de notre mieux pour limiter notre empreinte carbone en achetant seconde main ou en vrac et en remplaçant au fil du temps, de nos envies et de nos moyens tout ce qui est jetable dans notre maison par du réutilisable : essuie-tout, disques démaquillants, serviettes hygiéniques, couches, brosses à dents, etc.</p>
<p>Passer le cap dans la nourriture à emporter est à présent tout à fait accessible !</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Et que dire de l'impact environnemental qui est tout simplement ÉNORME ?</p>
<p>Âme sensible, passe au paragraphe suivant, les données qui suivent vont te donner des sueurs froides.</p>
<p>Sais-tu que les contenants réutilisables sont amortis après 30 utilisations alors que nous jetons les emballages à usage unique après seulement 30 minutes d'utilisation en moyenne ? Oui, oui cette jolie boîte en plastique qui contenait les délicieux sushis du vendredi soir a vécu moins de 30 minutes avant de finir en vrac dans la poubelle.</p>
<p>Ou encore que toutes les ressources utilisées pour produire un emballage jetable - matière première, énergie, main d'œuvre et transport - sont déjà gaspillées avant même que tu aies fini son utilisation tellement sa durée de vie est éphémère ? Ça fait cher pour des sushis quand même !</p>
<p>Autre information importante : les emballages plastiques sont fait à partir d'énergie fossile, autrement dit de pétrole.</p>
<p>Sachant qu'aujourd'hui l'ensemble des plastiques représente 6% de la consommation mondiale de pétrole et que la demande ne cesse d'augmenter sur ce secteur, les plastiques représenteront 20% de la consommation mondiale de pétrole d'ici 2050 soit 15% du budget mondial carbone, budget carbone qui doit être respecté en vue d’atteindre l’objectif de maintenir en dessous de 2°C le réchauffement climatique mondial, objectif accepté au niveau international. Ça fait froid dans le dos, non ? Ou devrais-je dire, il va faire très très chaud dans 30 ans...</p>
<p>Et si je te disais que seuls 14% des emballages plastiques jetables partent au recyclage et que 32% d'entre eux finissent dans la nature, essentiellement dans les milieux marins ?</p>
<p>Ce qui représente au moins 8 millions de tonnes de plastiques déversées dans la mer chaque année – ce qui équivaut à y décharger chaque minute le contenu d’un camion poubelle. </p>
<p>Et que si rien n’est mis en œuvre, ce nombre passera à deux par minute d’ici à 2030 et à quatre par minute d’ici à 2050. Si rien ne change, les océans devraient contenir, d’ici à 2025, une tonne de plastiques pour trois tonnes de poisson et, d’ici à 2050, plus de plastiques que de poisson (en poids). Les sushis auront un drôle de goût, tu ne crois pas ?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Notre engagement pour changer les choses tel le petit colibri qui fait sa part en déversant quelques gouttes d'eau depuis sont petit bec sur l'immense feu de forêt pour essayer d'enrayer la catastrophe : </p>
<ul>
<li>Mettre en circulation des emballages répondant à deux critères essentiels<ul>
<li> Fabriqués avec des matières respectueuses de l'environnement (la matière utilisée reste en discussion mais sera évidemment sélectionné selon des critères environnementaux stricts)</li>
<li>Fabriqués au Québec  (matière et technologie existantes au Québec)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mettre en place un système de récupération des emballages en fin de vie et garantir leur recyclage</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h3>Risques et challenges</h3>
<p>Notre plus gros défi restera de convaincre et de convertir des usagés en masse de participer au mouvement.</p>
<p>Mais finalement, la seule contrainte étant de rincer et de rapporter le récipient, y-a-t-il réellement un enjeu à convaincre ? N'est-ce pas un petit effort à notre portée à tous pour protéger notre belle planète ?</p>
<p>Nos détracteurs les plus féroces avanceront que le coût de l'abonnement est un frein à l'initiative.
