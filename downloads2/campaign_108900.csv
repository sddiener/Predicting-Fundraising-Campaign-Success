<p>THE NEED</p>
<p>I need to acquire and renovate a travel trailer to help me provide quality mobile mental health care services to those children, adolescents, and families who are in need. Moreover, I want to create a space that maintains the same privacy, warm, and professionalism that would be fostered in a traditional therapy setting. I seek a mobile commercial space to create Houston’s first-ever mobile therapy office dedicated to children, adolescent, and families in the lower-income areas of Houston and the surrounding rural areas. Having a mobile office space will enable me to provide mental health education and awareness to these communities, i.e. literature and free screening for depression, suicidality, stress, and anxiety, parent education, etc. When everything in the community feels chaotic and unsafe, I want the healing arts office to create a safe space to learn, evolve, and love.</p>
<p>ALLOCATION OF MONEY</p>
<p>To create this space, I will need to acquire a previously owned travel trailer (for renovation that will require painting, new flooring, and removal of any sleeping space), art supplies, storage space for therapeutic board games and toys, furnishings, printer, and other basic office materials. This is where the funds from our Kickstarter will come into play. Your support will allow us working capital to acquire a used travel trailer to renovate and create a unique mobile office space for Metamorphosis Behavioral Support &amp; Psychotherapy to deliver mental health services. The working capital will also allow us the ability to hire the necessary professionals to ensure that the children and adolescents are in a safe space. These include contractors, plumbers, electricians, painters, etc. as well as completing the required inspection, licensing fees and city permits.  </p>
<p>THE VISION</p>
<p>Our vision for the healing arts mobile office is “to make families whole”. This means that we provide services to that ensure that parents feel confident and empowered, when balancing their work-life isn’t so easy. Moreover, we are committed to our children and adolescents who struggle with bullying, poor self-esteem, stress, anxiety, etc. We strive to fill in the gaps of quality mental health care.</p>
<p>How You Can Help My Campaign Goal to raise a minimum of $8,500.</p>
<p>•  Choose your pledge amount, and provide information requested.</p>
<p>• You’ll be sent something special for your pledge.</p>
<p>• Share this campaign with friends, family, colleagues, or just people who love other people (or not, but just share!)</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your support!</p>
<p>Ase</p>
<p>CHALLENGES AND RISKS</p>
<p>This campaign needs your support to get the mobile office open and serving communities. The greatest challenge is not having the funding to acquire a reliable mobile unit that does not require major repairs. At any rate, I will use my tenacity and ability to connect with others to move pass the barriers. </p>
<p>When you back this project, you'll be providing a vessel in which the practice of healing art can be accessible to children, adolescents, and families in poor communities and/or rural areas near Houston, Texas.</p>
<p>The best part is you'll also be able to give the gift of mental health awareness to yourself and others who travel the bumpy road of parenting children with mental illness and/or behavioral problems.</p>

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Hello! Our group consists of Jonathan Clemons, Will Henderson, Shawn Mckay, and Griffin Fraser. We are all business majors at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. We are looking to raise money for Special Spaces <a href=""http://specialspaces.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://specialspaces.org</a>, a non-profit organization that designs and constructs rooms for children with life-threatening illnesses between the ages 2-19. We wanted to run campaign for this organization because it is important for children to live in a safe and healthy environment in the most comfortable setting. With money raised in this campaign we will be able to donate money to help with the materials to construct and design the rooms for the children. The two kids we are raising money for are Isaac and Henley. </p>
<p>Henley is 3 years old and has cancer. Special Spaces plans to use to money to create a Princess and Horses dream room, her two favorite things. </p>

To encourage you to donate to this special cause we are offering you perks if you donate!</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Our campaigns mission, along with Special Spaces, strives to give children with life threatening illnesses a healthy distraction from the challenges they must face every day dealing with their conditions by creating a dream bedroom of the child's wishing. The value of this project is incomparable to any other in that it makes the lives of children who were given a hand of less fortunate cards, just a little bit easier. For if we can contribute a little of all that we’ve been blessed with to help the life of just one child, it can show that child that there is hope. It can also raise awareness to the many other less fortunate children out there that need your help so that they may keep fighting through these advanced conditions.   </p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>My name is Brandon Posivak and I am the author of <i>Step on the Cracks: Reinventing Happiness, Positivity, and Optimism</i>. This book is targeted at a Generation Z audience and uses a combination of personal experiences, interviews, and psychological data to cover a different concept that Gen Z struggles with in each chapter. This book offers a new perspective on Gen Z happiness, positivity, and optimism, showing the reader in a conversational style that they are not alone and despite temporary defeat and negativity in life, happiness and success is achievable for themselves and for Generation Z as a whole.<br/><br/>One of the main goals of this book is to offer a new perspective on Gen Z happiness from a fellow member of the generation. Additionally, through the text I hope to show the reader that I am right there with them and still currently working on each of the concepts that appear in the chapters. For this reason, I also wanted to thank all the people who have had a positive impact on my life for their constant support and help. Different from a psychology professor’s Ted Talk or a motivational speaker’s videos, I want my book to be a breath of fresh air to my Gen Z audience and present them with new information on how to better understand their own unique happiness.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, the reader will discover how their own unique happiness fingerprint plays a role in their life and that it is also achievable for the future of Gen Z as a whole. Additionally, I hope to show that a “positive and optimistic outlook” in life may be a little different than what they were told as a kid. I am a member of Generation Z who is still figuring it all out, and I want to share with you what I have learned and show you that I am on this journey with you. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for helping others, self-reflection, and learning about happiness in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you build a foundation for your own happiness and future success and see how to apply what you learn in this book to not only your own life but to the lives of those around you as well.<br/><br/><strong>In this book, you'll learn about concepts that Gen Z struggles with and a new perspective on these issues:</strong></p>
<p>- Social media use and the comparison aspect to others that turns social media from a fun way to share memories with friends into a highlight reel of only “the best moments” which people inherently compare each other to</p>
<p>- The difference between happiness and joy, the two different forms of happiness (natural and synthetic) and why our psychological immune system is so powerful if we utilize it effectively</p>
<p>- Persistence and an understanding of the benefits of delayed gratification are important tools in pushing through temporary defeats in life to ultimately reach our goals</p>
<p>- Recognizing the importance of technology in our lives, but still being able to see the importance of humanity and as technology continues to advance, not letting it overshadow our human relationships and our appreciation of the world around us as we’re buried in our iPhones.</p>

<h3>The Book- <i>Step on the Cracks: Reinventing Happiness, Positivity, and Optimism</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in Three Parts....<br/><br/><strong>- Part One of the book is meant to be an introduction to Gen Z happiness topics,</strong> including the affects of social media, the different forms of happiness (natural and synthetic), the importance of our inner child, and how temporary defeat and delayed gratification play a role in our overall happiness. The social media chapter is one of the most relevant chapters in the book because it is a very significant factor in both Gen Z happiness and anxiety depending on how it’s handled.<br/><br/><strong>- Part Two focuses on the importance of perspective in relation to a positive outlook and an understanding of our psychological and emotional states</strong> as we transition from college into the real world. This section of chapters focuses on more “abstract concepts” such as why making your bed in the morning reduces the micro stress doses you accumulate in your day, how 64.28% of our life is spent at work, how the unpredictability of life should create opportunity and excitement rather than a fear of the unknown, how human beings have shifted from surviving to thriving and what that means for Gen Z, and how both negativity and positivity are necessary in our lives for us to fully appreciate the nuances of our existence.<br/><br/><strong>- Part Three focuses on optimism and is the most “concrete” or “practical application” of the sections.</strong> It covers the intersection between money and happiness, how Gen Z defines success and a meaningful career, the importance of our “why” as we attempt to make an impact on our future, conceptualizing our goals using reference points, and the stigma of “being busy” in society today and why socialization is a key factor in the happiness journey.<br/> </p>

<p>Brandon Posivak is a recent college graduate and former Division 1 baseball player from Los Angeles, CA. After graduating Magna Cum Laude, Brandon is currently an incoming law student at the Pepperdine University Caruso School of Law interested in both Sports Law and Business Law.<br/><br/>In going through one of the most difficult times in his life during his senior year of college, Brandon found writing a cathartic way of expressing his emotions. Faced with multiple serious family member illnesses, Brandon made the decision to stay home to work and go to school full-time while helping his family, giving up his senior year of baseball at school.<br/><br/>Struggling to find happiness among the challenges in his life, Brandon turned to his family and his research for a solution. He’s always believed that one of the most powerful things a human being can do is make someone else feel good and smile. In addition to his passion for sports and the outdoors, writing was always Brandon’s way to connect with his inner-self, and this book was a dual opportunity for him to share his personal experiences as well as interviews and psychological research to help even just one person reading his book smile and have a better life. That person will in turn share what they have learned with another and another and so on. With a new perspective and a new understanding of happiness, positivity, and optimism, Brandon hopes to be a voice of positivity and motivation for his generation.<br/><br/>Outside of writing, Brandon enjoys playing sports, hiking, fishing, scuba diving, and traveling.

My name is Brandon Posivak and I am the author of Step on the Cracks: Reinventing Happiness, Positivity, and Optimism. This book is targeted at a Generation Z audience and uses a combination of personal experiences, interviews, and psychological data to cover a different concept that Gen Z struggles with in each chapter. This book offers a new perspective on Gen Z happiness, positivity, and optimism, showing the reader in a conversational style that they are not alone and despite temporary defeat and negativity in life, happiness and success is achievable for themselves and for Generation Z as a whole.One of the main goals of this book is to offer a new perspective on Gen Z happiness from a fellow member of the generation. Additionally, through the text I hope to show the reader that I am right there with them and still currently working on each of the concepts that appear in the chapters. For this reason, I also wanted to thank all the people who have had a positive impact on my life for their constant support and help. Different from a psychology professor’s Ted Talk or a motivational speaker’s videos, I want my book to be a breath of fresh air to my Gen Z audience and present them with new information on how to better understand their own unique happiness.My hope is that, in reading this book, the reader will discover how their own unique happiness fingerprint plays a role in their life and that it is also achievable for the future of Gen Z as a whole. Additionally, I hope to show that a “positive and optimistic outlook” in life may be a little different than what they were told as a kid. I am a member of Generation Z who is still figuring it all out, and I want to share with you what I have learned and show you that I am on this journey with you. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for helping others, self-reflection, and learning about happiness in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you build a foundation for your own happiness and future success and see how to apply what you learn in this book to not only your own life but to the lives of those around you as well.In this book, you'll learn about concepts that Gen Z struggles with and a new perspective on these issues:
- Social media use and the comparison aspect to others that turns social media from a fun way to share memories with friends into a highlight reel of only “the best moments” which people inherently compare each other to
- The difference between happiness and joy, the two different forms of happiness (natural and synthetic) and why our psychological immune system is so powerful if we utilize it effectively
- Persistence and an understanding of the benefits of delayed gratification are important tools in pushing through temporary defeats in life to ultimately reach our goals
- Recognizing the importance of technology in our lives, but still being able to see the importance of humanity and as technology continues to advance, not letting it overshadow our human relationships and our appreciation of the world around us as we’re buried in our iPhones.
- An understanding of how to cultivate our “Why”- our personal motivation for wanting to go into a specific occupation or make the choices for our future- and how to use our “Why” to channel our passion into helping others
- The Gen Z perspective on accruing wealth, financial security, finding a job, and making an impact on that job using a combination of real interviews from Gen Z members as well as recent and relevant psychological data
You will love this book if you are a member of Gen Z interested in making a positive impact on the world as well as members of other generations who want to learn more about the psychology of Gen Z as we begin to inherit this world.

<p><strong>Why do we reach out </strong><br/>Up to now the treatments were given in several places that we rented. We recently received the opportunity to buy land (1000m2) in Kerala.

Meanwhile we have received many requests from women and children for help in educational, health and hygienic support. Although we (Aneesh and Miriam) are volunteering in this project in order to help as much as possible people we need to buy medicines (herbs, oils), hire doctors, therapists and build new spaces to meet the amount of requests we received.

<p>Sangheeta - 8 years old<br/>She goes to school every day by rickshaw instead of a 2 hour-walk, because of this transportation her mother is able to work. Which is crucial, since she is one of the few women in India that dared to divorce in order to secure the future of Sangheeta and her two sisters. Women that divorce take the risk of being excluded from the community, which means no work, no food, no prospect. Furthermore, Sangheeta received a school uniform and study material.</p>

No oxygen? IN SHORTS???!! How is this even possible?</strong></p><p>During his long existential journey, Wim Hof came face to face with nature’s most primordial elements. Staring right back, the merciless cold and bountiful air revealed an energy now lost to most of modern society, dormant inside all of us and waiting to be reawakened.</p><p>Having embraced these majestic forces, and breaking record after record in a range of death-defying feats, Wim resolved to share this discovery with the rest of the world. He gradually whittled his accrued insight down to the core essentials, so that people young and old, healthy and sick could tap into this potential without having to invest the same decades worth of study, travel and daring.</p><p>The result is the Wim Hof Method: a natural path to an optimal state of body and mind. It rests on three main pillars: a breathing technique; cold exposure; and a mind-set that allows one to incorporate these tools into daily life.</p><h3>Not Impossible - but I'm Possible</h3><p>Paul Vincent, adventure athlete and an expert on human performance and potential is all about breaking barriers. He knows that we limit ourselves with false beliefs, and its only by pushing the envelope that we discover the greatness that lies within us all.</p><p>Paul is our guide; through interviews, conversation and his own immersion into the process, he will be the eyes of the viewer, taking us along on the climb…exposing himself to altitude sickness, freezing temperatures, and a brutal never before attempted 24 hour group climb of Mt Kilimanjaro.</p><h3>Advancing Medical Science</h3><p>The human body is an incredible vessel. The mind even more so. The techniques that help climbers not only survive, but thrive at high altitudes, their skin exposed to freezing temperatures, are the same techniques that can be used to help us cure our own bodies of injury and disease.  </p><p>The climbers have agreed to participate in a medical study on the mountain that will capture data on internal core body temperature regulation and oxygenation. The advancement of science is a critical focus of this expedition.</p><h3>Your support</h3><p>We all want to be a part of something greater - your support will help us reach the summit, capture this incredible expedition, enhance our understanding of the human body through scientific principles and share it all with the world.</p><p>Additionally, a portion of the proceeds of this climb will be donated to a local charity in Tanzania.</p></div>","A Journey of the IncredibleTipping Point is both a world record attempt and an inspiring documentary.

Staring right back, the merciless cold and bountiful air revealed an energy now lost to most of modern society, dormant inside all of us and waiting to be reawakened.Having embraced these majestic forces, and breaking record after record in a range of death-defying feats, Wim resolved to share this discovery with the rest of the world. He gradually whittled his accrued insight down to the core essentials, so that people young and old, healthy and sick could tap into this potential without having to invest the same decades worth of study, travel and daring.The result is the Wim Hof Method: a natural path to an optimal state of body and mind. It rests on three main pillars: a breathing technique; cold exposure; and a mind-set that allows one to incorporate these tools into daily life.Not Impossible - but I'm PossiblePaul Vincent, adventure athlete and an expert on human performance and potential is all about breaking barriers. He knows that we limit ourselves with false beliefs, and its only by pushing the envelope that we discover the greatness that lies within us all.Paul is our guide; through interviews, conversation and his own immersion into the process, he will be the eyes of the viewer, taking us along on the climb…exposing himself to altitude sickness, freezing temperatures, and a brutal never before attempted 24 hour group climb of Mt Kilimanjaro.Advancing Medical ScienceThe human body is an incredible vessel. The mind even more so. The techniques that help climbers not only survive, but thrive at high altitudes, their skin exposed to freezing temperatures, are the same techniques that can be used to help us cure our own bodies of injury and disease.  The climbers have agreed to participate in a medical study on the mountain that will capture data on internal core body temperature regulation and oxygenation. The advancement of science is a critical focus of this expedition.Your supportWe all want to be a part of something greater - your support will help us reach the summit, capture this incredible expedition, enhance our understanding of the human body through scientific principles and share it all with the world.Additionally, a portion of the proceeds of this climb will be donated to a local charity in Tanzania.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><i>During pregnancy, it is all too common for an expectant mum to be offered a wealth of generic advice and information on pregnancy, childbirth and how to care for their newborn baby. </i></p>
<p><i>It is far less common to get a candid conversation started about the physiological and mental changes that come after childbirth. When it comes to postpartum recovery, most mums - especially first time mothers - have no idea what to expect. </i></p>
<p><strong><i>How is MUM BUB HUB offering the solution? </i></strong> </p>
<p>Becoming a mum or parent is such a cherished life experience but no one really talks about the nitty gritty aspects of pregnancy, birth and the recovery period. Most women who have experienced pregnancy or given birth will admit that there are some unfavourable aspects and physical after shocks, yet the realities of birth and recovery is still one of the most taboo conversations to have openly and publicly.</p>
<p>During our own pregnancies, we struggled to find information about postpartum recovery and struggled even moreso to find products to help make the healing process a bit easier. There is often so much focus on the precious newborn that we forget to focus on our recovery and ourselves. This set a spark in us, we knew that there had to be a better way to aid recovery and to start the dialogue around birth experiences and postpartum care.</p>

<p>Our products are made for Mums, by Mums – they have been designed with the intention to help new mums heal, recover and rest. Each product is formulated with 100% natural herbs, extracts and essential oils, which are traditionally used in homeopathy and herbal medicine.</p>
<p>We’ve especially selected ingredients like homeopathic arnica, witch hazel and a blend of wound healing, styptic and antibacterial herbs traditionally used for soothing and healing postpartum swelling, soreness, tears, episiotomies and bruising.</p>

<p>This means that all of our profits are reinvested back into the business or our social mission.</p>
<p>Our ethos is to inspire and encourage open and honest dialogue. We want to help women feel confident and comfortable in talking about the realities that come with being pregnant, the realities of birth and the gruelling realities of the post partum recovery period.  Our brand is so much more than the products we are developing. We want to tackle the taboos surrounding pregnancy, birth and post-partum healing – mental and physically.  </p>
<p>Our goal as a social enterprise is to make antenatal and post-partum care and support accessible to all, especially to those who cannot readily access these services and to aid parents in their transition to parenthood.  </p>
<p>The profits from each product go toward providing recovery care kits and antenatal workshops and support groups to vulnerable women, parents and families which will offer physical, practical and emotional care and support for mums before and after birth. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our manufacturers require us to purchase a large bulk quantity of each item which significantly increases the upfront investment. This can be a major hurdle for a small business such as ours, which may prevent us from competing with the big brands.</p>
<p>We expect to launch and begin shipping our first orders this Summer. We have developed a great relationship with our suppliers but because we are sourcing the highest quality products from around the world, there is always a small risk of having shortages and logistics issues, which can delay factory schedule by a few days or weeks.  We pride ourselves on customer service and integrity and so keeping our backers informed during the entire process is of upmost importance. We promise we will do our best to keep updated regularly and to ship on a timely basis.</p>

Providing access to yoga classes where a physical studio may not exist
Providing an at-home solution to doing yoga for people who do not have time to go to a studio
Providing a free option for people who cannot afford to pay for yoga classes
Creating a community that connects people with similar interests across the MENA region
Providing guidance on how to take the first steps to a healthier and more fulfilling lifestyle
Simply providing a tool for people to maintain a daily practice at home
 الاسباب1. توفير حصص يوغا للاماكن التي لا يتوفر فيها استوديو لليوغا.2.توفير حصص اليوغا في كل منزل للأشخاص الذين ليس لديهم الوقت للذهاب إلى الاستوديو.3.توفير خيار مجاني للأشخاص الذين لا يستطيعون دفع ثمن دروس اليوغا.4.إنشاء مجتمع يربط بين الناس ذوي الاهتمامات المتشابهة في الوطن العربي.5.توفير طريق واضحة حول كيفية اتخاذ الخطوات الأولى لنمط حياة أكثر صحة وأكثر سعادة.6.ببساطة توفير أداة للناس للحفاظ على الممارسة اليومية في المنزل. Why Refugees?The storyGrowing up in Palestine, under constant bombing, shooting and curfews the owner had personally experienced what it means to feel unsafe in one's own body, trapped with no space around, only when she was given this gift she started feeling space and safety within. Her personal mission has become to humbly share this gift with the world, especially with people who have been through similar experiences. Yoga has incredible physical benefits for disease prevention, disease management and in some cases healing diseases! It empowers us to take control over our own well-being, and of course, it is much cheaper, and with no side effects!  اللاجئين؟ لماذا؟القصةلقد عاشت المؤسِّسة طفولتها في فلسطين، في ظل القصف المستمر، وإطلاق النار وحظر التجول، و نتج لديها فهم بمعني الشعور بعدم الأمان، و الاختناق، حتى أُعطِيت هذه الهدية(اليوغا) بدأت تشعر بالمساحة الداخلية و السلام و الامان. فأصبح لديها  اهتمام خاص بمشاركة هذه الهدية مع العالم بكل ما تيسر لها، وخاصة مع الناس الذين مروا بتجربة مماثلة.  لليوغا فوائد جسدية كثيرة للوقاية من الأمراض، والتحكم بالأمراض وفي بعض الحالات الشفاء التام! كما انها أداة  تمكين تساعدنا على اخذ صحتنا بيدنا و البدء بالتغيير الايجابي، و من دون أعراض جانبية . كما يقول المثل "" درهم وقاية خير من قنطار علاج""  The reasons:
Provide tools for people to take their own step into feeling the space within where outer space does not exist
Allow people to take control over their own health in a cheap or even free way
The closeness the founder feels to post-traumatic cases due to personal experiences
الأسباب1. توفير الأدوات لاتخاذ الخطوة الاولى للشعور بالمساحة الداخلية في الأماكن التي لا يوجد فيها مساحة خارجية.2. تقديم الادوات و التوجيه السليم للعناية بالصحة.3. إحساس و مرور المؤسِسة بتجارب مماثلة.  This campaign aims to work in both directions, provide the MENA region with accessible yoga classes, guided meditations and simple health tips in their own mother tongue for free, and offer paid services including but not limited to courses, packages dedicated to prevention of certain diseases such as diabetes hypertension and management of others such as hypertension, chronic stress and different stages of diabetes and some physical projects. It then aims to use 10% of the profits made from selling packages to finance more work in refugee camps and other marginalized areas.By helping us create this, you will be helping millions of people around the world find the tools they could be looking for but have no access to. تهدف هذه الحملة إلى العمل في كلا الاتجاهين، احداهما توفير حصص و دورات يوغا ، وتأمل ونصائح صحية بسيطة في لغتنا الأم مجاناً، و الجانب الاخر يقدم خدمات مدفوعة الاجر  كحُزم مخصصة للوقاية من بعض الأمراض مثل ارتفاع ضغط الدم و السكري وسُبل التعامل مع أمراض أخرى  مثل ارتفاع ضغط الدم، والإجهاد و التوتر المُزمن و غيرهم. ويهدف بعد ذلك إلى استخدام 10٪ من الارباح لتمويل المزيد من العمل في مخيمات اللاجئين وغيرها من المناطق المهمشة.  من خلال مساعدتنا في إنشاء هذا المشروع، انتم فعليا تساعدون الكثير من الناس في جميع أنحاء العالم العربي في العثور على موارد و معلومات مساعدة قد تكون ما يحتاجون اليه.     What We Need & What You Get*  Due to the incredible support of people offering their services, we now need 2000 USD to create 33 videos and a webpage as a start .

<p><i>Cuidamos dos nossos Idosos! Amamos a Gerontologia!</i></p>
<p>Este projeto visa combater o isolamento e o sentimento de solidão de alguns idosos em situação de vulnerabilidade social na região de Trás-os-Montes através de intervenção gerontológica especializada e individualizada.</p>
<p>Pretendemos ir ao encontro de alguns idosos em situação de isolamento e melhorar significativamente os seus recursos sociais para um envelhecimento bem-sucedido. A intervenção abrange ações de avaliação gerontológica multidimensional, inclusão digital, animação sociocultural, mediação familiar e institucional e também a captação de conteúdos multimédia lúdicos e elucidativos da mais-valia do trabalho do Gerontólogo para a qualidade de vida dos idosos.</p>
<p>Em termos operacionais a angariação de fundos tem o objetivo de financiar a:</p>
<p>- Contratação em regime de prestação de serviços de dois recém-licenciados no curso de Gerontologia da Escola Superior de Saúde do Instituto Politécnico de Bragança por um período de 6 meses</p>
<p>- Meios e recursos audiovisuais para a realização de um documentário referente à intervenção gerontológica feita</p>
<p>- A edição de um livro sobre prática gerontológica, com base nas metodologias e resultados do projeto de intervenção.</p>
<p>- A realização de um seminário com todos os intervenientes do projeto.</p>
<p>Está já a ser levado a cabo um trabalho de articulação institucional e captação de parcerias e sinergias para maximizar o bem-estar e os ganhos gerados pelos fundos angariados.</p>

<p>In simplest terms: WILD MEDICINE SCHOOL will be like Netflix or GaiaTV, but for Plant Medicine teachings. Our platform will bring herbal teachings into your home, reestablishing plant wisdom and oral tradition, into daily life.</p>
<p><u><strong>Our Story:</strong></u> I'm a budding herbalist, my fiancé Renick is filmmaker, and we were approached by our teacher and friend, Clinical Herbalist/Ethnobotanist, Michael Cottingham, and his love, herbalist Lindsey Orellano, to create WILD MEDICINE SCHOOL.</p>
<p>We are creating WILD MEDICINE SCHOOL as an answer to our deep concern about the state of the world. We believe that many of our modern issues stem from being disconnected, from both the natural world, and ourselves.  That's why we're creating a platform based on the teachings and experiences that have profoundly transformed our lives.</p>
<p><i>WILD MEDICINE SCHOOL will be a an extensive, plant medicine, video library. A place to: study botanical medicine, learn from a variety of herbal elders, experience oral traditions, and unlock the healing potential of your own backyard... while preserving Plant Wisdom, and Oral Tradition, for future generations!</i><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Our Miracle</u>: </strong>WILD MEDICINE SCHOOL experienced its first divine push when Michael Cottingham offered over 40 hours of video of the late, world-renowned herbalist, Michael Moore, filmed in the field durning the 90's. These teachings are a treasure that need to be digitized, undergo picture and audio restoration, and be shared with the world!</p>
<p><strong><u>Our Plan</u>:</strong>  We plan to launch in several phases. </p>

<ul>
<li>Digitize &amp; Restore Michael Moore footage. </li>

<li>Build an online video hosting website/platform to house our videos.</li>
<li>Make sure the world knows about us, so this information can be shared.</li>
<li>Address the thousands of small details entailed in launching a project of this scope.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><u>What We Need</u>:</strong>  In truth, we need to raise <strong>$30,000</strong> to <strong>fully fund phase one. </strong>Indiegogo algorithms share campaigns that reach a large percentage of their goal quickly, so it's in our best interest to set our goal as low as possible.

<p>My name is Alyssa and I have recently moved to Boulder, CO, into the great unknown, to dive deeper on my path. My grandest passion is my crystal and sound healing practice (crystal singing bowls, drum, rattle, didgeridoo), where I also incorporate reiki and shamanic techniques I have learned along the way. I create crystal elixirs as well- soaked in moon/sun light, a highly activated crystal sacred geometry mandala and bathed in singing bowl and sound vibrations, potent prayers, healing songs and intentions.</p><p>It has been one of my deepest prayers, held long and
tenderly in my heart, to open myself ever wider to greater connection with our
elders and wisdom keepers of this Earth- to be graced by grandmothers and women
from every corner of the planet -to walk with them, sing with them, be blessed
by their teachings and healing work. 
There is nothing as sacred and special as to entwine our united hearts,
medicines and visions for a healthy, harmonious planet though prayer and
ceremony, and the 13 Indigenous Grandmothers hold important information and guidance for us in this deeply transitional times. The opportunity to work so
closely with a genuine and powerful group of Divine feminine, to dance in
passionate intention for the well-being of all living things, with the grace and
potency of my sisters- this gathering is a dream come true.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been a mission and passion of mine to
dedicate and devote myself to the healing of this Mother Earth and all
of her creatures, especially the waters. 
I tend to my water altar with reverence and infinite love and pour my healing elixirs into our waters all over the world. 
The water and its vitality is incredibly important to me, and it has become a very sacred and deep mission of mine to activate the purity of the waters in whatever way I can.  This amazing opportunity to join in united, collective love to bless the water already makes
my spirit celebrate and dance in ecstatic joy.</p>
<p>I feel this gathering of love so deeply in my soul. I <i>know</i> that I’m meant to be there. I have
been asked to be the steward of this blessing by my community in Boulder, to
bring back wisdom and gifts to share with all my sisters and brothers who are
not able to attend. The importance of my presence at this ceremony is not only one of my own growth and awakening, but one of service- to share the riches of ancient wisdom and tradition with all who wish to receive.</p><p>And on a soul level, I also feel that this gathering will serve greatly in activating and assisting me to further tap into my own medicine woman self, where I may be able to better serve all beings in a more illuminated and empowered way, inspiring others to grow, heal and awaken, gracefully and effortlessly. There is nothing more that I want in my heart than to be of service for the benefit and healing of ALL.</p><p> With courage and hope in my heart, I humbly bow in humility and prayer and ask
that you may help me attend this gathering with a donation. The gathering itself is $600 (for the cost of its production and flying the Grandmothers in from all over the world, and to support the furthering of their work) and getting there will probably be around another $200-300 or so, depending on how I get there (by plane or car). I am capable of contributing what I can, but without a very steady source of income at the moment, I need your extra help to make this dream a reality. Anything helps! And if you cannot make a contribution, please help spread the word to others who can!</p><p>For your heart-felt generosity and compassion, I know this
blessing will return to you a thousand-fold. This gift will extend far and
wide- its potency will ripple grandly as I spread this wisdom and love to all,
with joy in my heart.  I bow in infinite
gratitude and deep reverence- please help me make this possible- to welcome the
re-birthing of the spring, to celebrate my 29<sup>th</sup> ring around the sun
on March 21<sup>st</sup>, to create potent healing vibrations for the collective, and to bless the waters with a most beloved community
of medicine women, magic makers, peace and harmony bringers. Your support means the world to me!</p>

<p>Rose from the Concrete</p>
<p>At Rose From the Concrete (RFC), we aim to respond to our seemingly loveless society with (1) mentorship and (2) investments from the community in the forms of funding, opportunities and services for those who may need it. In the spirit of mutual aid funds, the gathering and redistribution of resources to support peers, we operate under the notion that our community is lacking severely in regard to our most fundamental needs (esteem, mental wellness, education, housing security etc) but that we have the power and the resources among us to fill this gap if we act collectively. </p>
<p>Our Aim</p>
<p>At RFC, we believe that the white-supremacist, capitalist patriarchy that we inhabit has harmful impacts on our communities, especially our youth, in two specific ways: 1)  by indoctrinating us all to adapt mindsets of anti-blackness, inferiority, and hyperproductivity that hinder one’s ability to have sound mental health and 2) by limiting our financial and material resources thus impeding on the financial and physiological security that is essential to one’s growth and self actualization, according to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. </p>
<p>Thus our work, in response, is two fold. We aim to offer mentorship that explores and advises our mentees in expressing true love as defined by bell hooks in her book All About Love, the extension of oneself for another’s or their own growth. Unlike typical conceptions of love as an emotion, Rose from the Concrete asserts that declarations of love are inseparable from the behaviors that accompany them. Here at RFC, we shall rely on the motto, ‘If I truly love myself, my close ones, and my community, I’m going to do what I can to support their growth.’ Thus, our primary goal is to teach healthy schema of love to empower others, including members and nonmembers, to love themselves fully and actively spread LOVE through community engagement.</p>
<p>Second, we recognize that basic financial and physiological security is a prerequisite to mentees and members being able to properly learn and implement what we teach. How can we expect anyone to have proper eating and sleeping schedules, essential self love practices, when their circumstances prevent these from being an option or a priority? Thus, we also aim to crowdsource essential resources from community members in the form of funds, opportunities and affordable services so that recipients can have the security to prioritize love in its truest form. </p>
<p>Our Model </p>
<p>Our organization is composed of four types of members: a cluster of committees that enable the core work of mentorship and redistribution to happen properly; a network of partners that support org beneficiaries (committee members, mentors, mentees (and community members)) in a multifaceted nature; mentors; and mentees.</p>
<p>In order to be a committee member one must first, be placed on a committee corresponding to interest and skill set, and then go through the RFC curriculum where we teach our core content around love. The latter is a requirement because committee members are expected to benefit from the program that they work for and because they will be better able to support and advocate for RFC because their own participation grants them a clear understanding of our work. After gaining this understanding, they attend weekly committee meetings to work on tasks essential to the daily flow of the org. </p>

</div></div>","Rose from the Concrete
At Rose From the Concrete (RFC), we aim to respond to our seemingly loveless society with (1) mentorship and (2) investments from the community in the forms of funding, opportunities and services for those who may need it. In the spirit of mutual aid funds, the gathering and redistribution of resources to support peers, we operate under the notion that our community is lacking severely in regard to our most fundamental needs (esteem, mental wellness, education, housing security etc) but that we have the power and the resources among us to fill this gap if we act collectively. 
Our Aim
At RFC, we believe that the white-supremacist, capitalist patriarchy that we inhabit has harmful impacts on our communities, especially our youth, in two specific ways: 1)  by indoctrinating us all to adapt mindsets of anti-blackness, inferiority, and hyperproductivity that hinder one’s ability to have sound mental health and 2) by limiting our financial and material resources thus impeding on the financial and physiological security that is essential to one’s growth and self actualization, according to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. 
Thus our work, in response, is two fold. We aim to offer mentorship that explores and advises our mentees in expressing true love as defined by bell hooks in her book All About Love, the extension of oneself for another’s or their own growth. Unlike typical conceptions of love as an emotion, Rose from the Concrete asserts that declarations of love are inseparable from the behaviors that accompany them. Here at RFC, we shall rely on the motto, ‘If I truly love myself, my close ones, and my community, I’m going to do what I can to support their growth.’ Thus, our primary goal is to teach healthy schema of love to empower others, including members and nonmembers, to love themselves fully and actively spread LOVE through community engagement.
Second, we recognize that basic financial and physiological security is a prerequisite to mentees and members being able to properly learn and implement what we teach. How can we expect anyone to have proper eating and sleeping schedules, essential self love practices, when their circumstances prevent these from being an option or a priority? Thus, we also aim to crowdsource essential resources from community members in the form of funds, opportunities and affordable services so that recipients can have the security to prioritize love in its truest form. 
Our Model 
Our organization is composed of four types of members: a cluster of committees that enable the core work of mentorship and redistribution to happen properly; a network of partners that support org beneficiaries (committee members, mentors, mentees (and community members)) in a multifaceted nature; mentors; and mentees.
In order to be a committee member one must first, be placed on a committee corresponding to interest and skill set, and then go through the RFC curriculum where we teach our core content around love. The latter is a requirement because committee members are expected to benefit from the program that they work for and because they will be better able to support and advocate for RFC because their own participation grants them a clear understanding of our work. After gaining this understanding, they attend weekly committee meetings to work on tasks essential to the daily flow of the org. 
As mentors, community members volunteer to be a direct point of contact and support for mentees as they navigate our curriculum on love but also, in a bidirectional manner, they are a focal point for the org, letting us know the needs of our mentees so that we can constantly be responding directly to them. The partnerships that we aim to foster will be rooted in feedback we get from these mentors. Thus, it is a requirement that they go through the same RFC curriculum that committee members study and live by, but also that they go through extra training in order to: 1) learn how to be active listeners and effective mentors and 2) learn the expectations and proper boundaries for the mentor- mentee relationships. 
To become an RFC mentee, one must commit to the completion of three years within the program, where they’ll study self love during the first year, interpersonal love during the second, and community love in the third. This is the main requirement as we don’t aim to be selective nor exclusionary in our teachings nor the distribution of resources. If someone actively wants to do the work to better themselves and their communities, we want to welcome them with open arms. Furthermore, after completion of the three year program, mentees have the opportunity to: 1) become a mentor 2) become a committee member or 3) enter the network as someone who offers support to org beneficiaries in some way. This is aimed at maintaining the sustainability of the org but also its impact. Those that receive its benefits are expected to pay it forward either within the organization or outside of it. 
Finally, network members are those that offer a service, an opportunity or funding to committee members, mentors or mentees. Examples of these partners can be licensed therapists that offer free or more affordable services to our members, legal counselors that can support mentees and their families that are facing such obstacles, tutors, and folks from countless other professions and walks of life.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In this day and age, people aren't getting enough nutrients due to their poor eating habits (especially in America). Americans love eating fast food, and thus have the highest heart-disease rate in the world. By taking control of our choices and making sound decisions around food and personal habits, we can help prevent illnesses and make positive impacts on our health. This is especially important for women, who need to feel empowered by an alignment of the body, mind, and soul. <strong>How to be a Holistic Vegan Diva</strong> will provide a much needed tool in this quest for a sound and holistic lifestyle.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Malandra is a vegan chef, a Holistic Health Coach/Consultant (certified in Dec. 2017), and is a firm believer that 'We Are What We Eat'. In 2012, Malandra discovered the world of holistic living because of a sudden personal illness. After a surgery in 2013 she started The VeganDiva to share her journey and educate women on maintaining a healthier lifestyle. Never in a million years did she see herself as vegan! But after realizing how much better her body and mind felt living a holistic lifestyle, she knew she needed to find ways to educate and help people to understand that being vegan doesn't mean a life of boring, tasteless food. The goal of this campaign is to raise enough money to cover the costs of producing <strong>How to Become a Vegan Diva</strong>, and to continue providing a platform for communities of women who desire a holistic lifestyle, without breaking the bank. Like Malandra, this campaign is a creative fighter that will produce a holistic meal-planning journal, no matter what obstacles we encounter! If we don't reach the campaign goal we will find ways to be creative in reaching our goal of completing the meal-plan journal with whatever funding we do have.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Awareness is just as important as raising money, so if you're unable to make a monetary contribution towards our project but would still like to help, please share our crowdfunding page and help us reach our goal!</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Jimena, Peruvian-Argentine and about to turn 40.<br/>How do I introduce myself to you so that you can feel what I feel, to inspire you with what empower me?<br/>Almost two years ago, I left Peru, my country and it wasn't easy at all, but that impulse me to find new paths, also made me dream bigger, meet women and men from different parts of the world. I started to create what is today ""Jimena, The Body-Love Coach"". Because when I wanted to create my own vision, and connected with the type of coaching that I wanted to do, I also found my own story. Sometimes there are events that we want to forget.</p>
<p>How to summarize it?</p>
<p>A girl who grew up in a macho and violent city that experienced abuse, harassment and sexual violence in the streets, she decided to hide or radically flee from this world, but she definitely has more lives than you can imagine.<br/>That girl is me, I fought with myself, I mistreated and wanted to flee more than once. I hid my body, fed it badly, insulted it, hated it, chose bad relations; Until the day came. Not because we change our lives in one day, but because that day began this great journey,  more than ten years ago.<br/>On my journey, I found my freedom, I discovered my being a woman, my beauty, my power.<br/>From my body connection, my own movement,  listening and releasing, I realized that I was very powerful, and discovered also that I was sexy, sensual, strong, vulnerable, and that I had a very strong connection with people. I realized the power I had in my heart, to listen, to mobilize, to push, to motivate, to inspire. I can assure you that the road has not been easy, and still it is. Sometimes I found myself with doors that blocked me, but I have learned to live with some certainties and with thousands of uncertainties. I learned to travel and get away from people, family, friends. I learned to live in detachment.<br/>In my way, my body has been my ally, after having been my enemy for many years, hurting with words and acts; and for that reason perhaps I undertook to heal it, to love it, to embrace it, and to be his best ally. My friends were the theater, dance, free movement, coaching from a body approach, Yoga, meditation.</p>
<p>In this last two years, I've been creating, my brand: Jimena, The Body-Love Coach in Reston, Virginia. On August I will go to India, to certified as a Yoga instructor, and to continue traveling, connecting, motivating and inspiring women and men like you with my videos, classes, conversations. There are so much pain and criticism in this world, body shaming. Social beliefs of how we should think, behave, be. And for me, the recipe for this change is to focus on ""Love"" and our body. The more loving we are with our bodies, the more we dedicate ourselves to this relationship. That is why I ask for your support so that you help me to continue creating this awareness with our body, to accompany me on this journey. I need your support with my trip to India and Thailand, and to spread the Body-Love coaching that I am doing online. </p>

I learned to travel and get away from people, family, friends. I learned to live in detachment.In my way, my body has been my ally, after having been my enemy for many years, hurting with words and acts; and for that reason perhaps I undertook to heal it, to love it, to embrace it, and to be his best ally. My friends were the theater, dance, free movement, coaching from a body approach, Yoga, meditation.
In this last two years, I've been creating, my brand: Jimena, The Body-Love Coach in Reston, Virginia. On August I will go to India, to certified as a Yoga instructor, and to continue traveling, connecting, motivating and inspiring women and men like you with my videos, classes, conversations. There are so much pain and criticism in this world, body shaming. Social beliefs of how we should think, behave, be. And for me, the recipe for this change is to focus on ""Love"" and our body. The more loving we are with our bodies, the more we dedicate ourselves to this relationship. That is why I ask for your support so that you help me to continue creating this awareness with our body, to accompany me on this journey. I need your support with my trip to India and Thailand, and to spread the Body-Love coaching that I am doing online.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3> - About Me -</h3>
<p><strong>My name is Ria Kuroki. </strong>I have been practicing yoga for 8 years and teaching what I have found on my mat for last 4 years in America. I truly feel that yoga is my foundation to learn how to observe my thoughts and redirect my action towards a better self. </p>
<p>Few years ago, I started questioning <strong>""How can I spread this amazing wisdom, yoga, to more people?"" </strong>Then, an opportunity presented itself to me last year. I inherited my grandparent's farming land in Kagoshima, Southern Japan. I immediately thought<strong> ""I want to use this abandoned land to bring people together so that our collective energy can regenerate the land and we are able to experience what is like to live more self sustainable and loving ways!"" And to me, that's the wisdom of yoga - creating unity within and beyond of ourselves. </strong></p>
<p>I am anxious to launch a project that is something bigger than myself, but<strong> I believe that anything is possible when we have a right vision, mindset, willingness and support to enjoy every step of this journey! </strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need <strong>YOU</strong> the most!</p>
<p>Even if I had millions of dollars to build a sustainable destination place, that is not what I want. I want to include you to build the place together so we can experience every step and share the joy along the journey. I want a world wide community to spread the knowledge you will learn at Kansha Farm to pass on to your loved ones and future generations. No special skills are necessary to join this project. <strong>Your excitement, willingness, ideas, and any experiences in your life will start creating a place where we can get together to be more alive. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2018, I will offer 7 day gratitude, Kansha, retreat hosting 36 people in 3 months (July to October). 4 people maximum per retreat. *We will create groups according to your traveling dates.</li>
<li>$400 will cover your accommodation, 3 daily meals and nearby airport transportation for the retreat.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the funding goes to necessary start up fees such as housing, transportation, local tour, food and promotion.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is not going to be an usual unplug and escape type of retreat.<strong> This is going to be more of a place where people will be actively searching, experiencing  and shearing ways of minimal but rich lifestyle. </strong>So any of your contribution matters to enrich one's life and also the earth as well. The more people start living towards sustainable ways possible, the better the earth will be. <strong>The impact you make comes right back to you.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why Crowdfunding?</strong></h3>
<p>Why did I choose a crowdfund platform? - because I am not offering business here. I don’t have a budget or investors to set up everything to run a business and I’m glad that is the way. I want everyone to get involved to create a farm so <strong>WE</strong> can say <strong>WE</strong> built something significant together. <strong>You contribute your energy to this farm that eventually leads to an amazing worldwide community (in my dream now) and I want to be a part to hold the root!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My challenge is to get you at my farm. <strong>You don't know me. </strong>I don't imagine people will be so excited to book a flight to get to half way around the world and stay at a stranger's house! If you do, I think you are kinda crazy...! So I somehow need to come up with a plan to make myself available to you so that you can sort of trust me or get a sense of who I am.</p>

<p>The Beyond the Diagnosis Art Exhibit's focus is on children living with a rare disease. Artists have donated their time and talents to paint rare disease patients for this groundbreaking Exhibit. This beautiful Exhibit will travel to medical schools and hospitals across the country encouraging the medical community to look ""beyond the diagnosis"" to the patient. With an average diagnosis time of 8 years and few treatment options, doctors and rare disease patients need to have a more engaged approach to reduce diagnosis time and improve care. There are 15 million children suffering and dying from a rare disease in the United States. Very few have treatment, there are NO cures. One of the greatest barriers to quality of life for these children and their families is the years of torment and confusion as they wait for a correct diagnosis. Art has been used for thousands of years to successfully convey a message, whether it be a story or a glimpse into the human spirit. At Rare Disease United Foundation we believe that art not only leaves a lasting impression, but creates a unique connection for the viewer. Rare disease patients will benefit greatly from the powerful impression the Beyond the Diagnosis Art Exhibit will leave on the medical community. Please consider helping us spread the story to the people we need to see us most, the medical community. This stunning Exhibit is unforgettable. Please visit our photo gallery to see pictures of the children!</p>

They are simply “thank you” gifts you’ll receive by supporting the project with a donation!Les cadeaux ne sont PAS représentatifs des coûts des futurs séjours au Lodge, ce sont simplement des avantages dont vous bénéficierez en soutenant le projet par un don!THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT - MERCI POUR LE SOUTIEN - GRACIAS POR EL APOYO:   INTI ECO LODGE:       Hi I'm Anne, for those who do not know me yet, I launched this crazy project to build a sustainable eco-lodge in the middle of the Peruvian Amazon in November 2014.Accompanied by friends, surrounding communities, and volunteers from all around the world, we have begun to transform an area that has suffered from illegal charcoal production into an authentic retreat, in perfect harmony with its environment.We launched our first crowd funding campaign in April 2015, and collected $10,000 USD through generous donations! SECTION 1: The Project:What is a solidary eco lodge?A 100% ecological experience that relies on the exchange between local populations.  Inti Eco Lodge will be an alternative to conventional tourism. We invite people to come and stay in a unique place in the heart of the Amazon jungle.The goal is to create a wellness center based on self-sufficiency, where everyone can learn to live holistically and sustainably, relax, heal naturally, attend educational workshops and express creativity.Inti Eco Lodge is the first lodge in the Amazon to use sustainable development concepts such as bio construction, rainwater harvesting, solar energy, permaculture, and the treatment and recycling of wastewater to avoid contamination. The wood we use comes from trees of the surrounding area: 1 cut tree = 1 tree replaced / replantedWhen replanting, we use endangered species and plants or trees with medicinal properties.In doing so we are creating areas of reforestation, conservation and education.   We are currently building a greenhouse with adobe bags, to grow organic fruits and vegetables. Additionally, we are digging out a natural pool of tropical aquatic plants, which will provide guests with an alternative swimming area to the river. Located deep in the rainforest, we will provide jungle discovery walking and boat tours.The lodge will offer various activities such as yoga, meditation, music, art, and wellness workshops, massages, kayak tours, stand up paddleboarding, archery, fishing, and cooking classes with our local organic products.  We will also offer care and treatment of traditional Amazonian plant medicines for those interested.Inti Eco Lodge will be a place of solitude, where we will educate and raise awareness - with the collaboration of surrounding communities – on subjects such as sustainable development, alternative lifestyles, and the value of local organic products. Accommodation:Several lodging options will be available: a dormitory (with 24 beds), basic bungalows (without bathroom), superior bungalows (toilets and private bathroom) and luxurious cabanas tucked away in the trees.I want to break the idea of “if it’s healthy or organic, it must be more expensive,” as I often hear in my feedback.Rates of your stay will depend on accommodation, activities and budget to make the lodge affordable and enjoyable for everyone! Proceeds:A portion of the profits of our business will assist neighboring communities and their needs: we plan to build wells to access clean drinking water, dry toilets, or education centers, according to their needs.   Another part will be devoted to research and development of conservation/reforestation, education, and ecological projects, as well as wages for workers to ensure maintenance and proper functioning of the lodge. Volunteering: We are building the center with the help of volunteers from around the world. It's an amazing experience to bring together people of all ages, professions and backgrounds, while sharing the same core values ​​and commitment.  All volunteers simply want to learn and help; some have no construction experience, but simply the will to complement others with knowledge and skills in terms of construction, architecture, biotechnology or permaculture.So why not you?We want to think collectively and gather ideas to find the most appropriate and sustainable solutions to the various challenges of the project, and in total respect to the neighboring communities. SECTION 2: What has been done since the 2015 campaignWe launched a campaign in April 2015 and through generous donations, we had the chance to make great strides forward in the project.
We were supplied with more tools and built a garage.
We constructed a 48-meter bridge to help reach another part of the land, when the river rises during rainy season.
We built a 24-bed dormitory for volunteers and future travelers.
We finished construction of the kitchen/restaurant, large dining room, and terrace.
We did half of the bio construction greenhouse. We are missing windows, doors, interior fittings and equipment for growing crops.
We made our first basic bungalow for 1 or 2 people in the middle of the jungle, below a small community of monkeys.
We set up different types of mounds outside for growing food, and gradually began harvesting some fruits and vegetables. We also started to make a botanical garden and a space for medicinal plants.
We dug out ¾ of the natural pool for aquatic plants and bought the large liner (geomembrane).
          You trust us and so do they:Since the Peruvian Ministry of Agriculture visited our project last summer, 100 hectares have been offered for reforestation of the Amazon.Since the first campaign, a French production agency, Babel Press, has also been interested in the process of our project. A film crew immersed themselves in the jungle with us in September 2015, again in January 2016, and a last time in May 2016. Emotions and laughter guaranteed!The documentary will be broadcast on the most famous channel in France ""TF1"" in the ""Reportage"" program on Sunday, February 26, 2017.We are proud to have entered the Francophone travel guide le Petit Futé, to be considered a Climate Observer by France24, recognized as a solidary eco lodge by Mr Mondialisation, recommended by Earthship Biotecture and many other acknowledgments.We thank them for their fantastic support, for their enthusiasm participates in the realization of this dream. SECTION 3: What can be done with the money of this campaign:We have set a goal of $10,000 to make the target reachable, but in reality we need more to complete the project as imagined.Our primary objectives are to ensure the safety of people on site, to complete the various well-built structures and to furnish them, and start the reforestation project of 100 hectares given to us by the Ministry of Agriculture. Specifically we would like:
To have a new boat because we can no longer provide transportation. We are 4 hours from the nearest hospital, but we can reduce this time, especially in the case of emergency, by also buying a good motor. ($5,000)
Install plumbing systems in the kitchen and restaurant ($2,000)
Purchase appliances for the kitchen, restaurant, and juice bar located on the terrace. ($3,000)
Furnish the dining room and terrace ($3,000)
Install plumbing systems and furnish the public bathroom of 6 showers, 4 sinks, and 4 dry toilets. ($4,000)
Furnish the dormitory with mattresses, sheets, mosquito nets, chests, and tables. ($5,000)
Build wooden bungalows with leaf roofs. ($2,500 / bungalow). We would like to build 8 to begin with.
Finish digging the natural pool and put in tropical aquatic plants, which will serve as filters in the first basin. We would also like to build a wooden boardwalk around the outside, and buy two solar pumps to circulate water in the second basin that will be used for swimming. ($3,000)
We would like to make more mounds outside for cultivating crops and obtain more germinated seeds/plants to put outside and in the greenhouse. ($1,000)
Buy solar panels, batteries, and converters to have electricity at the lodge. We indeed need energy for evening lights, kitchen appliances, water pumps, and recharging electronics like laptops, cameras, and tools. ($7,000)
Build the Maloca, a traditional large circular building, which will serve as a venue for various activities. ($12,000)
Build/purchase equipment for yoga, meditation, dance, and music classes ($5,000)
Buy equipment for kayaking, stand up paddleboarding, and archery ($3,000).
Construct a building for massages and buy the appropriate equipment. ($5,000).
Construct luxurious cabanas in the trees. ($5,000 to $10,000 per cabana).

Ainsi nous créons des espaces de reforestation, de conservation et d´éducation.  Nous construisons actuellement une serre avec des sacs d´adobe, pour les fruits et légumes bio. Nous creusons une piscine naturelle de plantes tropicales aquatiques qui permettra une zone de baignade alternative à la rivière.  Étant situés en pleine jungle, nous proposerons une expérience inoubliable d’immersion dans la faune et la flore amazonienne avec des randonnées découvertes à pied ou en bateau.Le lodge offrira différentes activités telles que le yoga, la méditation, des workshops de musique, d´art et de bien-être, des massages, des tours en Kayak, du paddle board, du tir à l’arc, de la pêche et des cours de cuisine avec nos produits locaux.  Nous offrirons également la possibilité d’accéder à des soins et traitements de médecines traditionnelles locales.Inti Eco Lodge sera un lodge Eco-Solidaire, où nous éduquerons et sensibiliserons - avec la collaboration des communautés - nos visiteurs, sur le développement durable, le mode de vie alternatif, et la valeur des produits sains et locaux. Les hébergements : Plusieurs options d’hébergement seront disponibles : un dortoir (avec 24 lits), des bungalows basiques (sans salle de bain), bungalows supérieurs (toilettes et salle de bain privée) et des cabanes, extra confortables, dans les arbres.Je souhaite casser cette idée de : « si c’est sain ou si c’est Bio, c’est forcément plus cher », comme j’entends bien souvent lors de mes retours d’expériences.Les tarifs de votre séjour dépendront de l’hébergement, des activités et du budget de chacun, afin de rendre le lodge accessible à tous! Les bénéfices : Les bénéfices de notre activité permettront d´aider les communautés voisines selon leurs besoins : nous projetons de leur construire des puits pour l´accès à l´eau potable, des toilettes sèches ou encore des centres d´éducation.    Une autre partie sera destiné à la recherche et au développement de projets de conservation/reforestation, d’éducation, d´écologie, ainsi qu’à la rémunération des travailleurs, à l´entretien et au bon fonctionnement du lodge.  Le Volontariat :Nous construisons le centre avec l’aide de volontaires venant du monde entier. C’est une expérience exceptionnelle de rassembler des gens d’âges, de professions et d’horizons différents mais partageant tous les mêmes valeurs et le même engagement.   Tous les bénévoles ont simplement la volonté d'apprendre et d’aider : certains n'ont aucune expérience en construction, mais une grande volonté qui se complémentarise avec d'autres qui ont les connaissances et compétences en terme de construction, d'architecture, biotecture ou permaculture.Donc pourquoi pas vous ?Nous voulons raisonner de manière collective et rassembler des idées afin de trouver les solutions les plus adaptées et durables aux différents challenges du projet et dans le respect le plus total des populations avoisinantes. SECTION 2: Ce qu´on a fait depuis la campagne de 2015 Nous avons lancé une campagne en avril 2015 et grâce à vous, à vos dons, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir faire de grandes avancées dans le projet :
Nous avons commencé par acheter plus d´outils et nous avons construit un garage.
Nous avons fait un pont de 48m pour pouvoir atteindre facilement, quand la rivière monte pendant la saison des pluies, une autre partie du terrain.
Nous avons construit un grand dortoir pour les volontaires et futurs voyageurs.
Nous avons terminé les édifices de la cuisine/restaurant, salle à manger et la terrasse.
Nous avons terminé l’édifice de la salle de bain commune.
Nous avons fait la moitié de la bio construction. Il nous manque les vitres, les portes, l’aménagement de l’intérieur et le matériel pour la production alimentaire.
Nous avons fait notre premier bungalow basique pour 1 ou 2 personnes, au milieu de la jungle, en dessous d’une petite communauté de singes.
Nous avons mis en place différents types de buttes extérieures et nous commençons petit à petit à récolter certains fruits et légumes. Nous avons également commencé à faire un jardin botanique et un espace pour des plantes médicinales.
Nous avons creusé le ¾ de la piscine naturelle de plantes aquatiques et acheté un grand liner (géomembrane).
          Vous nous faites confiance et eux aussi :D’ailleurs depuis la visite du ministère de l'agriculture de notre projet l’été dernier, 100 hectares nous ont été offerts pour aider à la reforestation de l'Amazonie.Depuis la première campagne, une agence de de production, l’agence Babel, s’est également intéressée à l´avancé de notre projet. Une équipe de tournage est venue en immersion totale, en septembre 2015, puis en janvier 2016 et une dernière fois en mai 2016. Emotions et fous rire garantis !Le documentaire sera diffusé sur TF1 dans l´émission “Reportage” le dimanche 26 février 2017 à 14h45.Aussi, je dois dire que nous sommes fières d´être rentré dans le guide de voyage francophone le Petit Futé, avoir été considéré comme un observateur de climat par France24, nommé lodge eco solidaire par Mr Mondialisation, recommandé par Earthship Biotecture et bien d´autres articles…Nous vous remercions pour votre fantastique soutien, pour l´engouement qu´attire ce projet et de participer à la réalisation de ce rêve ! SECTION 3: Ce qu´on pourra faire avec l´argent de cette campagne:Nous avons mis un objectif à 10 000$ pour qu’il soit facile à atteindre mais en réalité nous avons besoin de bien plus afin de terminer le projet comme nous l’imaginons.Nos objectifs premiers sont d´assurer la sécurité des personnes sur place, terminer les différentes constructions bien entamées puis les meubler et commencer le projet de reforestation des 100 hectares donné par le Ministère de l’Agriculture. Concrètement nous aimerions :
Avoir un nouveau bateau car le notre ne peut malheureusement plus assurer les transports Nous sommes à 4h de l’hôpital le plus proche et nous pourrions réduire ce temps, surtout en cas d’urgence, en achetant également un bon moteur. (5000$)
Nous aimerions acheter le matériel nécessaire et des arbres pour la reforestation. (2000$)

Así creamos las áreas de reforestación, conservación y educación.    Estamos construyendo un invernadero con sacos de adobe para producir frutas y verduras orgánicas y una piscina natural de plantas acuáticas tropicales que permitirán una zona de baño alternativa al río.    Al estar situado en la selva, propondremos una experiencia inolvidable de inmersión en la fauna y la flora amazónica con excursiones a pie o en barco.El Lodge ofrecerá diversas actividades como el yoga, la meditación, talleres de música, arte y bienestar, masajes, el tiro al arco, el paddle board, paseos en kayak, la pesca y clases de cocina con productos locales. También ofreceremos atención y tratamiento con plantas medicinales tradicionales locales para los interesados.Inti Eco Lodge será un Lodge eco-solidario en donde educaremos y sensibilizaremos -con la colaboración de las comunidades- a nuestros visitantes sobre el desarrollo sostenible, el modo de vida alternativo y el valor de los productos sanos y locales. Alojamiento: Varias opciones de alojamiento estarán disponibles: habitaciones con 24 camas (y espacio para una hamaca), bungalós básicos (con una cama doble o dos camas individuales, aseo y un cuarto de baño público sin baños) o superior (inodoro y baño privado) y cabañas muy confortables en los árboles.Quiero romper esta idea de ""si está sano o si es orgánico es necesariamente más caro"", como he oído muchas veces.¡Las tarifas de su estancia dependerán del alojamiento, las actividades y el presupuesto de cada uno con el fin de hacer el Lodge accesible a todos! Los Beneficios: Los beneficios de nuestra actividad permitirán ayudar a las comunidades vecinas y, según sus necesidades, les construiremos pozos para el acceso al agua potable, baños secos o también centros de educación.    Otra parte irá hacia la investigación y el desarrollo de proyectos de conservación, educación, ecología, y a los salarios de los trabajadores, el mantenimiento y el buen funcionamiento del Lodge. El Voluntariado: Construimos el proyecto con la ayuda de voluntarios de todo el mundo. Es una experiencia increíble poder reunir a personas de diferentes edades, profesiones y orígenes pero todos compartiendo los mismos valores y el mismo compromiso.  Algunos voluntarios no tienen conocimiento en la construcción sino simplemente la voluntad deaprender y ayudar. Otros tienen experiencia y habilidades en construcción, arquitectura, construcción ecológica y permacultura. Entonces ¿por qué no usted?Queremos pensar colectivamente y reunir ideas para encontrar las soluciones más adecuadas y sostenibles para los distintos desafíos del proyecto y en total respeto de las comunidades vecinas. SECCIÓN 2: ¡Lo que se hizo con el dinero de la campaña  2015! Lanzamos una campaña en abril del 2015 y gracias a ustedes, a sus donaciones hemos tenido la oportunidad de hacer grandes avances en el proyecto: 
Comenzamos por la compra de más herramientas y hemos construido un garaje.
Construimos un puente de 48 metros para poder llegar fácilmente al otro lado del terreno cuando el río sube su caudal durante la temporada de las lluvias.
Construimos un dormitorio para los voluntarios y futuros viajeros.
Hemos terminado los edificios de la cocina/restaurante, comedor y de la terraza.
Hemos terminado el edificio del baño público.
Hemos hecho la mitad de la bio-construcción (invernadero). Nos falta las ventanas, las puertas, Acondicionamiento interior y el material para la producción alimentaria.
Hicimos un primer bungaló básico para 1 ó 2 personas en medio de la selva, por debajo de una pequeña comunidad de monos.
Establecimos diferentes modelos de cultivos exteriores y comenzamos poco a poco a cosechar algunas frutas y verduras. También comenzamos a hacer un pequeño jardín de plantas medicinales.
Hemos cavados los 3/4 de la piscina de plantas acuáticas, y hemos comprado un forro (geomembrana de pvc).
          Ustedes confían en nosotros y ellos también:El ministerio de la agricultura, después de haber visitado nuestro proyecto, decidió ofrecernos 100 hectáreas de terreno para ayudar a la reforestación de la Amazonia.Desde el año pasado, tenemos la oportunidad de ser seguidos por un equipo de la agencia de producción Babel Press quienes han documentado el avance en nuestro proyecto. Llegaron por primera vez en septiembre del 2015, luego enero del 2016 y la última vez en mayo del 2016. Eldocumental será transmitido por TF1 el domingo 26 de febrero del 2017 a las 2:45 pm (hora francesa) en la emisión del programa ""Reportage "". Estamos orgullosos de ser parte de la guía de viaje del guia francés “Petit Futé”, ser considerado como un observador climático por France24, nombrados “Eco Lodge Solidario” por Mr Mondialisation, recomendado por Earthship Biotecture y muchos otros artículos.¡Les agradecemos para el fantástico apoyo que nos dan, el entusiasmo que genera este proyecto, y de participar en hacer nuestro sueño una realidad!SECCIÓN 3: ¿Qué vamos a hacer con el dinero de esta campaña?:Hemos puesto un objetivo de 10 000 dólares para que sea más fácil alcanzarlo, pero en realidad necesitamos mucho más para terminar el proyecto como lo imaginamos.Nuestros objetivos principales son garantizar la seguridad de las personas en el terreno,terminar las distintas construcciones ya empezadas así como amueblarlas, y empezar el proyecto de reforestación de los 100 hectáreas ofrecidos por el Ministerio de la Agricultura. Concretamente nos gustaría: 
Tener un barco nuevo, desgraciadamente el nuestro, ya no puede garantizar más los transporte. Estamos a 4 horas del hospital el más cercano y podríamos reducir ese tiempo, más que todo en caso de emergencia, con un buen motor. (5 000 dólares)
Comprar el material necesario y árboles para la reforestación. (2 000 dólares)
Empezar la construcción del sistema de tubería de la cocina y del restaurante. (2 000 dólares)
Comprar el equipo de la cocina, del restaurante y del Juice Bar de la terraza. (3 000 dólares)

Construir bungalós de madera con techo de hojas. (2 500 dólares/bungaló). Nos gustaría construir unos 8 para empezar.
Terminar de cavarla piscina natural y colocar las plantas tropicales que servirán de filtro en una primera pequeña piscina. Nos gustaría también hacer el contorno de madera y comprar dos bombas solares para la circulación del agua en la piscina que servirá para bañarse. (3 000 dólares)
Nos gustaría hacer mas huertos/cultivos, comprar más semillas fértiles/árboles para los cultivos exteriores y el invernadero. (1 000 dólares)
Comprar paneles solares, baterías, convertidores para tener electricidad en el lodge. Necesitamos energía para para las luces para la noche, el equipo de la cocina, las bombas para las duchas y para recargar celulares, cámaras, y las herramientas. (7 000 dólares)
Construir la maloca, un gran edificio circular que servirá como lugar para las actividades. (12 000 dólares)
Comprar el material para el yoga, la meditación, la danza, y los talleres de música. (5 000 dólares)

<p>The International Veterinary Students’ Association (IVSA) is a not-for-profit organization run by volunteer veterinary students.</p>
<p>The mission of IVSA is “<strong>To benefit the animals and people of the world by harnessing the potential and dedication of veterinary students to promote the international application of veterinary skills, education and knowledge</strong>.” IVSA unites over thirty thousand students, helping them to improve their skills as future veterinarians, gain experience and widen the knowledge about international methods and ways used in veterinary medicine, conservation of wild species and animal welfare. The way in which this is achieved is by arranging international Congresses, Symposia and Conferences, facilitating exchanges between our members and many projects and educational opportunities focusing on animal welfare, one health, education, soft skills and student wellness.</p>

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>ABOUT THE CONGRESS</strong></p>
<p>Due to the involvement of our chapter on the international level and our contribution to the development of the Association, IVSA Kraków has been honoured by being nominated and chosen for the host of the upcoming, 67th IVSA Congress.</p>
<p>IVSA Congress is the biggest and the most prestigious international event organised by and for veterinary students.</p>
<p>For the event we plan to accept 220 veterinary students representing over 30 countries. <strong>All eager to broaden their knowledge and gain practical experience in the veterinary field.</strong></p>
<p><strong>o When?</strong></p>
<ul><li>16th-27th of July 2018</li></ul>
<p><strong>o Number of delegates</strong></p>
<ul><li>220</li></ul>
<p><strong>o Main theme</strong></p>
<ul><li>Wellness of veterinary students and veterinarians</li></ul>
<p><strong>o Theme of the educational part</strong></p>
<ul><li>„<strong>Be a Supervet!</strong> – New approach to Veterinary Medicine”</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We have planned for our delegates 12 days full of activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>General Assemblies</li>
<li>Lectures and workshops</li>
<li>Development Fund Auctions</li>
<li>International Stands</li>
<li>Exchange Officers' meeting</li>
<li>Touristic attractions</li>
<li>Social events</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>There is no time to rest but a lot of time for self-development and wellness ;) </strong></p>
<p>Preparing the event requires<strong> tremendous amount of time, effort and a big financial outlay.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>EDUCATION</strong></p>
<p>Educational part, which we are putting a lot of heart into. We are planning to organise general lectures addressed to all the delegates as well as lectures and workshops in six panels:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Companion animals</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bovine</strong></li>
<li><strong>Horses</strong></li>
<li><strong>Exotic animals</strong></li>
<li><strong>Swine</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bees</strong></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We have invited lecturers from UCVM JU-UA as well as speakers from outside of our University, also from abroad.</p>
<p>Delegates attending Congresses are motivated and search the possibilities of improving their qualifications in order to become successful veterinarians.</p>
<p>It is also one of the reasons for the theme of the educational part of the Congress, which focuses on innovation, research, new technologies and methods of treatment used in veterinary medicine.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530045864/gvkauupskg7hnr2fyhab.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WELLNESS</strong></p>
<p>The main theme of the event is „Wellness”.</p>
<p>It is an extremely important, but most of the times neglected in the veterinary society issue, not only among veterinarians but also veterinary students, who struggle with many issues such as stress associated with work/studies.</p>
<p>We are planning lectures addressed to all the delegates, prepared by veterinarians in cooperation with psychologists as well as workshops with the psychology students’ group „Flow” and Wellness Committee of IVSA.</p>
<p>We would like to provide the delegates with the access to the gym/sports hall and organise events such as volleyball or soccer matches, kayaking, biking trips or a short dancing course. We want to make the students aware of how important physical activity is as well as having a hobby, which help to deal with the stress.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>TURISTIC ATRACTIONS</strong></p>
<p>During the Congress, Organising Committee strives to provide the delegates with the opportunity to learn about the history and culture of their own country. Due to the convenient location, we are able to offer trips to many facilities important both historically as well as culturally.</p>
<p>In the plan:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kraków tour</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trip to the „Wieliczka” Salt Mine</strong></li>
<li><strong>Auschwitz – Birkenau Museum</strong></li>
<li><strong>Educational trip to the Tatra National Park</strong></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>BUDGET</strong></p>
<p>IVSA Congress is an event which requires many hours of preparations, many sacrifices as well as a huge financial outlay.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fees from the delegates are covering 2/3 of the cost.</li>
<li>We have found companies willing to support us with the sponsorship as well.</li>
<li><strong>But we are still looking for support, the campaign goal is 5000 $, nevertheless each contribution counts!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, we would like to ask you for the support of this amazing event, thus supporting young, ambitious students (soon to be veterinarians), whose the involvement of and the will to develop their knowledge and skills motivate them to participation in such events.</p>

The mission of IVSA is “To benefit the animals and people of the world by harnessing the potential and dedication of veterinary students to promote the international application of veterinary skills, education and knowledge.” IVSA unites over thirty thousand students, helping them to improve their skills as future veterinarians, gain experience and widen the knowledge about international methods and ways used in veterinary medicine, conservation of wild species and animal welfare. The way in which this is achieved is by arranging international Congresses, Symposia and Conferences, facilitating exchanges between our members and many projects and educational opportunities focusing on animal welfare, one health, education, soft skills and student wellness.

 
ABOUT THE CONGRESS
Due to the involvement of our chapter on the international level and our contribution to the development of the Association, IVSA Kraków has been honoured by being nominated and chosen for the host of the upcoming, 67th IVSA Congress.
IVSA Congress is the biggest and the most prestigious international event organised by and for veterinary students.
For the event we plan to accept 220 veterinary students representing over 30 countries. All eager to broaden their knowledge and gain practical experience in the veterinary field.
o When?
16th-27th of July 2018
o Number of delegates
220
o Main theme
Wellness of veterinary students and veterinarians
o Theme of the educational part
„Be a Supervet! – New approach to Veterinary Medicine”
 
We have planned for our delegates 12 days full of activities:

General Assemblies
Lectures and workshops
Development Fund Auctions
International Stands
Exchange Officers' meeting
Touristic attractions
Social events

There is no time to rest but a lot of time for self-development and wellness ;) 
Preparing the event requires tremendous amount of time, effort and a big financial outlay.
 
EDUCATION
Educational part, which we are putting a lot of heart into. We are planning to organise general lectures addressed to all the delegates as well as lectures and workshops in six panels:
 

Companion animals
Bovine
Horses
Exotic animals
Swine
Bees

 
We have invited lecturers from UCVM JU-UA as well as speakers from outside of our University, also from abroad.
Delegates attending Congresses are motivated and search the possibilities of improving their qualifications in order to become successful veterinarians.
It is also one of the reasons for the theme of the educational part of the Congress, which focuses on innovation, research, new technologies and methods of treatment used in veterinary medicine.

WELLNESS
The main theme of the event is „Wellness”.
It is an extremely important, but most of the times neglected in the veterinary society issue, not only among veterinarians but also veterinary students, who struggle with many issues such as stress associated with work/studies.
We are planning lectures addressed to all the delegates, prepared by veterinarians in cooperation with psychologists as well as workshops with the psychology students’ group „Flow” and Wellness Committee of IVSA.
We would like to provide the delegates with the access to the gym/sports hall and organise events such as volleyball or soccer matches, kayaking, biking trips or a short dancing course. We want to make the students aware of how important physical activity is as well as having a hobby, which help to deal with the stress.
 
TURISTIC ATRACTIONS
During the Congress, Organising Committee strives to provide the delegates with the opportunity to learn about the history and culture of their own country. Due to the convenient location, we are able to offer trips to many facilities important both historically as well as culturally.
In the plan:

Kraków tour
Trip to the „Wieliczka” Salt Mine
Auschwitz – Birkenau Museum
Educational trip to the Tatra National Park

 
BUDGET
IVSA Congress is an event which requires many hours of preparations, many sacrifices as well as a huge financial outlay.

Fees from the delegates are covering 2/3 of the cost.
We have found companies willing to support us with the sponsorship as well.
But we are still looking for support, the campaign goal is 5000 $, nevertheless each contribution counts!

<p><strong>Tribal Village is a conscious Ecovillage and Retreat Center in Guatemala, Lake Atitlan. We invite you to co-create with us a place of spiritual evolution.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tribal Village was created so that a global family of visionaries, healers and lightworkers would have a physical home in an inspiring and supportive environment. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe that a better, more connected world is possible. Tribal Village is a place where we are building this world. And we want you to be part of it.  </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538764968/q8vy5csvw0u4n1fsykk9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3><strong>Why do we need support ?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>We acquired a new land next to the houses we rent, and we want to transform it in a Glamping Tepees area, with 5 traditional tepees, dry toilet, shower and a terrace for Morning Yoga practice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We as well need to upgrade our community kitchen, as we are offering this year packages with food (breakfast and lunch) included.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Until now, we could welcome 25 people between our tents, the dormitory, and the few rooms we have. With 5 tepees more, we can receive 10 people more, so 35, in an organic comfortable space, connected with Nature.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So we need at least 5000 USD to buy :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5 tepees of 3.5 meters diameter (as the tepees are made in Mexico, we need to ship them with Private courier, so the total cost of one tepee is 700 USD)</strong></li>
<li><strong>5 mattresses double size (each costs 80 USD) and bed-sheets, mosquito net.</strong></li>
<li><strong>5 wooden trunks with locks for people to secure their belongings (each trunk is big enough for a backpack and costs 80 USD)</strong></li>
<li><strong>A new gas stove with 6 outlets ; 200 USD</strong></li>
<li><strong>3 Tables for the kitchen : 240 USD</strong></li>
<li><strong>Shelves and cupboard for the community food : 400 USD</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dry toilet next to the tepees : 1000 USD</strong></li>
<li><strong>Showers next to the tepees : 1000 USD with hot water</strong></li>
<li><strong>TOTAL EXPENSES : 7140 USD</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You see that the total cost is more than 5000 USD, so if we get more, you know what we will do with it !</strong></p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Our community space is unique because here, everyone is empowered to share their Light, talents and skills in service to each other and to the environment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Right on the shore of the lake, in a quiet and pristine natural surrounding, we have manifested this Oasis of Wellness for peaceful and spiritual warriors.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We offer retreat packages where everyone can come to morning practice (yoga, Qi gong, meditation) and to an afternoon session (healing, lectures, ceremony, drumming, music, dancing, women circles...). Breakfast and Lunch are included 5 days a week, and a community kitchen is available for dinners and weekends.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our center provides an incredible space to reconnect with yourself, to go deep into your healing journey, to meet beautiful people from all over the world and to celebrate life !</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p><strong>To hold space for a Retreat Center in Guatemala can be challenging. The materials are quite expensive, and there are no second hand or recycled stuff to collect like in Europe.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The manpower needs to be trained to match the eco friendly and organic standards we want.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We try to do many things by ourselves, but it is as well important to support the local community and to give them jobs,as many villages around the lake are struggling with poverty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We really want to include the villagers and local workers in our project, to provide them education and give them new ideas to expand their life in a  sustainable way.</strong></p>

<p>Those days of summertime
happiness have turned into lifelong friendships for all of us, and Danny was
that common connecter through the years who befriended all of us. Even now,
more than 30 years later, all of us share a mutual awe of Danny. He was
dedicated to helping others. He possessed an amazing ability to get people to
smile—and even to belly laugh. He was the consummate teacher, a selfless
leader; a champion of what is good in this world, and a fantastic son, brother,
husband, father, and friend.</p>
<p>On March 31, 2014, we attended
his funeral. Losing Danny has reminded us how deep the relationships that began
at Lutheran Lakeside Camp run.  As we
grieve with Kerri, the kids, Roy, Freda, Steve, the extended family, and ourselves,
we feel compelled to do “something.” </p>
<p>Our initial thought was to
create a memorial at Lakeside for Danny. But we believe Danny would be too
humble for such a tribute. He would, however, welcome appreciation for the
entire Miltner family for the impact they have all had and continue to have on
each of us. Now that would be something Danny would like!</p>
<p><b>The Miltner Era at LLC</b></p><p>The “Miltner” era at LLC
was wonderful and memorable. Pastor Roy served as Director of LLC from 1976-1988 with wife, Freda, by his side. Roy and Freda had a hand in bringing us to LLC, staffers and campers alike. They shared their family with all of us through their dedication to the
camp. Their legacy continues to make a difference in the lives of countless
numbers of families, campers, and staffers alike. Danny and Kerri’s
relationship grew as they worked together at Lakeside, and soon many of our
lives were further enriched with their marriage and family.</p><p><b>The Miltner Retreat Center</b></p><p>
To honor Danny, and in recognition of the impact the entire Miltner family has
had on Lutheran Lakeside, we encourage you to join us in making a gift in
Danny’s memory and in tribute to the entire Miltner family to the LLC “All Are
Welcome” campaign.  Working with the camp
leadership, we have decided to focus these gifts to create the “Miltner Retreat
Center”. </p><p>This project will renovate the Camp House formerly the Property
Managers residence near the main entrance to the camp. The lower level will
include a great room, kitchenette and two bunk style rooms, private restrooms
and showers. The main level will also include a great room, open kitchen and
five bedrooms with private restrooms and showers. Both levels will create a place
for classes, workshops, conversation and study. The house has heating and air
conditioning. </p><p>The cost of the total renovation is $150,000.  (You can learn more about the specifics of
the campaign by going to: <a href=""http://www.lutheranlakeside.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Lutheranlakesidecamp.com</a>.) If you have already given
to the campaign, you can simply indicate to the camp that you want your gift

In Danny's Honor...We met our friend Dan Miltner at Lutheran Lakeside Camp in the early 1980’s as camp staff or even
first as campers. During those pilgrimages to Lakeside every summer, we grew up
with Danny.  All of us have stories about
how he touched our lives in a very special way.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>1 Canadian in 5 will personally experience a mental illness in their lifetime. Five out of the 10 leading causes of disability worldwide are mental disorders. About 4,000 Canadians commit suicide each year and It represents 24% of all deaths among 15-24 year olds. Once depression is recognized, help can make a difference for 80% of people who are affected, allowing them to get back to their regular activities.</p> <p>As our world has gotten busier and more technologically connected than ever before, the realm of counselling has advanced right alongside. At Ignited Minds, we are keen to do our best to meet client needs through video calls, while also ensuring we adhere to our professional and ethical obligation as we make all reasonable efforts to safeguard client confidentiality at every turn. Our practice consists of students who are actively studying to obtain their Masters degree and pursue counselling as a career. </p> <p>The title “counsellor,” is unregulated in the province of British Columbia. With that being said, anyone can throw a sign on their door and call themselves a counsellor. However, at Ignited Minds, we support the growth of Undergraduate students who are looking to gain experience in the industry;  Having the option to work as a freelance counsellor is a great opportunity for those looking to gain counselling experience, earn income part time, and work flexible hours while still accommodating one’s school schedule.</p>
<p>I came up with this idea and business structure because I understand the struggle of being a full time student, looking for part time work that could coexist with my school schedule while doing everything I possibly can to pay bills, and make ends meet in our costly city- while also maintaining a healthy work/life balance. </p> <p>I took what I knew was a struggle for many millennials like myself, and created a solution. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm hoping to raise $5000 for marketing purposes. We're in the process of collaborating with both Narcity Vancouver and Daily Hive Vancouver- we want to be prepared for any costs that come with these deals.</p>
<p>I'd like to to create brand awareness and build client acquisition. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My vision revolves around helping people transform their personal challenges into life-enhancing opportunities; and to support undergraduates in an atmosphere that promotes self exploration and growth.</p>
<p>Students shouldn't have to feel limited to part time retail or office jobs. It's hard to find a job that accommodates ones school schedule; maintaining a work-life balance is about separating your personal and professional lives without allowing one to encroach upon the other. Both are important, neither should be neglected- but it's even harder to maintain this balance once you've secured a job, especially for college and university students.</p>
<p>This project can be seen as valuable to many because we all know what it's like having to struggle to make ends meet in what is tough day and age to be a millennial in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Counselling sessions at Ignited Minds are only $35 for a 1 hour virtual session. 70% of the earnings go directly into the pocket of the student counsellor- That's $24.50 worth of earnings!</p>

<h3>I hate running!</h3>
<p>I hate how I breathe like a pig. How my limbs fumble like noodles. How my hair splits down the middle without mistake every single time. And most important of all, I hate how hard it is!</p>
<p>Yet, here I am. 1 month away from the NYC Marathon, asking for your support so I can enter.</p>

<h3>Why am I doing this to myself?</h3>
<p>Because I’m not running alone. </p>
<p>10 months ago, out of curiosity, I joined <a href=""https://www.backonmyfeet.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back on my Feet</a> (BoMF), a non-profit that helps homeless people restore confidence and strength through running. Members, who maintain 90% attendance of the running program, will receive access to employment and housing resources.</p>

</div></div>","Help me get this out of the way.
I hate running!
I hate how I breathe like a pig. How my limbs fumble like noodles. How my hair splits down the middle without mistake every single time. And most important of all, I hate how hard it is!
Yet, here I am. 1 month away from the NYC Marathon, asking for your support so I can enter.

 
Why am I doing this to myself?
Because I’m not running alone. 
10 months ago, out of curiosity, I joined Back on my Feet (BoMF), a non-profit that helps homeless people restore confidence and strength through running. Members, who maintain 90% attendance of the running program, will receive access to employment and housing resources.
I started running with the team at 5:30AM a few mornings of the week. Together, we ran through the snowstorms of NYC, the melting heat of the West Side Highway, and over countless miles, bridges and boroughs. The best part is that I was always cheered on by one of the guys at Samaritan Daytop Village -- a recovery program and shelter for homeless veterans.

<p>It's the season for canned goods drive!  I love these drives, but while they're good for families who are needy and live in a home, my only problem with canned food is that it isn't very practical for homeless people. They don't have a kitchen to prepare the canned food in, and even if they are fine with eating cold green beans from a can when hunger strikes, what if they don't even have a can-opener?</p>
<p>So in a couple of weeks when winter break starts I'd love to get together with some friends to make blessing bags filled with items that are convenient for homeless to use. The bags will include things like nuts, granola bar, ready-to-eat canned goods with peel back lids, apples, bananas, bread, crackers, etc. If we can manage, it will also include miscellaneous necessities like tissues, inexpensive hats, etc. <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>I will contact homeless shelters in my area to find the most apropriate place to either donate or distribute these bags. </span></p>
<p>Let me know if you're in the area and would like to join! In fact, I want to throw a party out of the event and make mojitos+homemade chipotle burrito bowls for anyone who comes and brings items for the blessing bag! Open invitation!</p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We really don't need much. Hopefully my friends and I will be able to buy a decent amount of food ourselves. This funding campaign is here just in case anyone wants to help out but can't come make the bags with me. A dollar or two can help. You don't even have to donate! You can help out by making your own blessing bags at home and giving them out on your own time</p>

<p><strong>Give Massage Geeks a Hand</strong><br/>Have you ever thought to yourself: dang, I’d like to have or gift a massage sometime before the end of 2018? Or maybe you’ve thought: those Massage Geeks, Aislinn and Daniel…. I’d like to give them a gift/ have a cup of coffee/ or support them in some small way? WELL, NOW IS YOUR CHANCE! EVEN BETTER: YOU COULD WIN A PRIZE FOR DOING SO!</p>
<p>Massage Geeks is getting an official massage therapy space in downtown Woodstock. That’s right! A bona fide office space with easy parking and everything! We are so excited, we could spit (but we won’t because that is unhygienic)! This has been our business dream and we are thisclose to having it realized. An independent office space will allow us to market ourselves to a broader community and will offer us a location to continue providing the best orthopedic/therapeutic massage around. We see this as a huge launching point and opportunity for our business.<br/><br/><strong>Why Do We Need This Money?</strong><br/>You may already know this, but building an office space and jumping through bureaucratic hoops is $$$$. We are super pleased to join the City of Woodstock business community, but there are a lot of extra $$s tied to being independent massage therapists within the city limits. We’ve done our best to financially prepare for the transition from home business to legit office space, yet navigating the thicket of red tape has been more challenging than anticipated. Given the bureaucratic timeline of permits, inspections, paperwork, et al, we will be paying our lease for at least a month or two before we can actually begin practicing out of the space. And after that chore is completed, we have some start up costs involved in establishing Massage Geeks as the place to get the best massage in the metro-Atlanta area.</p>
<p>Your generosity can help us realize our business dream. Our goal of $2000 will assist us in covering the costs of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting our bureaucratic Ts crossed and Is dotted. Estimated: $300.</li>
<li>Furnishing the new office space (we plan to scour yard sales and thrift stores for deals, but these costs do add up!) - $500</li>
<li>2 seated massage chairs; Massage Geeks plans to hire other massage therapists to work some of our larger events in 2018! $200 each; $400 total</li>
<li>Marketing expenses as we introduce ourselves to our new community! - $500</li>
<li>Massage equipment to provide the best experience possible to our clients including but not limited to:<ul>
<li>Table extensions/pads for better client comfort. Massage tables are not a one-size-fits-all experience! - $150</li>
<li>Hydrocollator and heating pads - $300</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the money will be used to directly fund building our business. We have a big year planned for 2018 - we just need a little assist to get there!</p>
<p>Whatever amount we receive will be very appreciated and welcomed. If we don't reach our goal, we will still apply whatever amount we receive toward our business costs. We will also honor the goodies associated with each gift. </p>
<p><strong>Yeah, But What Do I Get Out of It?</strong><br/>We want to make it easy and rewarding for you to assist us. Essentially, we are trying to pre-sell as much massage as we can to build a nest egg. Each opportunity offers a reward or a chance for winning a drawing. What is this about a drawing? Glad you asked. Here it is:<br/><br/><strong><i><u>THE MOST SPLENDIFEROUS MASSAGE DRAWING OF ALL TIME*</u></i></strong><br/><font size=""1"">*Well, the most amazing drawing the Massage Geeks has ever offered anyway.</font></p>
<p>Enter to win:</p>
<p><u>Silver Prize</u>: One Free Hour-Long Massage. Use it yourself or be generous and gift it to a loved one.</p>
<p><u>Gold Prize</u>: One Two-Hour Massage. You could gift it to someone else – but really, do you love anyone that much? Let’s be honest. You are keeping it to yourself.</p>
<p><u>Grand Prize</u>: ONE FREE YEAR OF MONTHLY MASSAGE!!! You read that right – throughout 2018, you can book a one-hour massage each month FOR FREE with either of the Massage Geeks. Can’t use it yourself that month? Gift it someone else! That is TWELVE HOURS OF FREE MASSAGE.</p>
<p><strong>I Don't Have Money, But I Want to Help!</strong><br/>Can’t help out monetarily but still want to help? We got you covered. There is a second drawing for sharing our fundraising campaign. One click on the Share on Facebook button gets you entered. Prize for this drawing is a free one-hour massage gift certificate and a $20 gift card to Think Geek (because we’re geeks). And yes, you can enter both drawings!!!</p>

<p><strong>$5</strong> – Fond wishes from the Massage Geeks. Fond like whoa.</p>

<p><strong>When Will This Drawing Happen Anyway?</strong><br/>The Grand Prize drawing will be held on Friday, December 8 – just in time for holiday gifting! The Facebook Share drawing will be held the same day.<br/><br/><strong>And When Will the Massage Geeks Office Open for Business?</strong><br/>Not soon enough in our opinion! We hope to hold a grand opening in early January 2018. Keep an eye out for an invite to our grand opening party!</p>

<p>For 9 years this girl has been battling a horrible disease, and remains a cheerful child. This strong girl’s fight has not been in vain. A new drug, Dinutiximab, can help Oleksandra overcome the disease forever.</p>
<p>This is how Dinutiximab works:</p>
<p>The basis of the drug are monoclonal antibodies that attach themselves to the tumor cells damaging and marking them for the immune system of the patient. After that, the immunity is actively attacking and destroying the tumor. The drug destroys all cells of the neuroblastoma. Successful treatment can lead to a life without relapse – a happy life without cancer.</p>
<p>The cost of 1 vial of Dinutiximab (20 mg) is about 10 900 EUR .</p>
<p>One course of treatment requires from 1 to 5 vials, depending on how the patient tolerates the drug. Up to 5 courses may be needed. One course costs as much as 40 thousand euros.</p>

<p>Thanks to Oleksandra Brailovska, this new drug can cost much less! This girl is fully suitable for treatment with Dinutiximab because she has a small amount of tumor cells and she is responsive to chemotherapy. And that is why the effectiveness of this drug is very high in her case. And we will show it to the whole world, which will lead to product certification in many countries, increased demand in the world and the development of generics (duplicates), which will significantly reduce the cost of Dinutiximab – a life-saving medicine.</p>

Designed in an effort to help improve overall patient health without the use of pharmaceutical medications, AcuMed can be used to treat stress, pain, drug addiction, smoking, obesity and many other ailments caused by energy blockages across the body’s meridians.The opioid epidemic has spread like wildfire across America and the globe, and the struggle to find reasonably affordable remedies for both the addicts and their families continues to spark it. AcuMed believes its product line will be a tremendous asset to the addiction therapy regiment and that the AcuMedHelp.com forum will act as the central hub for discussions, literature and media on the many ways the product line can benefit and treat those suffering from this heartbreaking dependency.As a drug free natural treatment that simply clips to your ear, AcuMed can be used without a doctor or any prior medical experience and can grant struggling addicts that foot in the right direction.

 
Acupressure is an external form of acupuncture that doesn’t penetrate the skin, but instead focuses on trigger points that will help correct the flow of energy throughout the body. Although both acupressure and acupuncture have proven health benefits, a medical professional is typically needed to administer the procedure. Our hope is that AcuMed will allow more addicts to take this first step on their own at home, which will in turn give them the boost and confidence to seek further treatment, ultimately rewiring their brain.  Many eastern cultures believe that the majority of illnesses, both physically and mentally, are caused by the impeded flow of energy throughout the body. By unblocking the body's various energy meridians, opioid addicts can think clearer while feeling connecting deeper with the next important step in their healing process. Step 1: Remove the AcuMed device from the box.Step 2: Clip it to the trigger point that best suits your needs.Step 3: Apply for 20 minutes (3x daily) Each backer of $25 (EARLY BIRD) or more will receive the full AcuMed box package, which includes the following:* (1) AcuMed device* (1) Manuel in six languages* (1) Cleaning Cloth* (1) Tin holding container* (1) Key chain container adapter PLUS, we will donate one (1) AcuMed device package to an addict in need for every package backed on Indiegogo!AcuMed needs to reach its funding goal of $30,000 in order to take the next step towards FDA approval and the homeopathic alternative to curing addiction, including the following:* Introduce the product to market* Legal and medical fees* Production and marketing development* To bring awareness to addicts and their loved ones, therefore providing hope And, AcuMed proudly supports and partners with Horses Healing Hearts!",19.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hey everybody, I'm Aaron. I'm a spouse, a dad, an organizer and a church worker. I'm scheduled for gender-affirming surgery on July 17th. My insurance covers part of this but will still leave me and my family with big outstanding medical bills. Healthcare for everyone, including trans people, should be free-- Medicare for all! Until we win that, please pitch in if you can. I hate asking for help like this but between my own mental health, my family's well-being, and rising policy attacks on trans people, I feel some urgency in getting this done soon. Thanks!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>Here's a summary of costs</p>
<ul>
<li>$3,000 out-of-pocket costs for surgery (that's after insurance)</li>
<li>TBD follow-up pharmacy costs</li>
<li>Two weeks of missed wages at one of my three jobs (I will attempt to keep working the other two from the couch during my recovery)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This medically necessary intervention in my life will help me to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not exist in a chronic low-level state of dissociation</li>
<li>Be more fully present to my family as a partner and a parent</li>
<li>Double-down in my work as an organizer</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If you like toddlers, queer families, poor people's organizing, and me-- then this is the low-risk/high-return investment for you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I'll be on the couch for two weeks and we have a toddler. HELP! PM/email myself or Shelly to volunteer some childcare hours.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! We are students at the University of Tennessee and our goal is to raise money for Marlin Williams’ dream. Marlin is a ten year old boy who is diagnosed with  Congenital Heart disease. He has went through two Open Heart surgeries, has a mechanical valve, and will need a new heart in the future. Our job is to raise enough money to give Marlin a well deserved break from his daily life. Marlin’s dream is to be famous like Drake, Lil Wayne, or Steph Curry and perhaps go shopping with one of them. The Dream Connection is trying to make Marlin’s dreams come true. The Dream Connection is a non-profit organization in Eastern Tennessee that makes kids, with life threatening illnesses, dreams come true! </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Our Goal</strong></h3>
<p>The goal of our campaign is to raise $1,000 for Marlin’s dream. The $1,000 will help contribute to any costs of meeting and shopping with one of Marlin’s idols. We have different perks for different types of donation values including handmade jewelry. Every donation counts and even if we do not reach our goal of $1,000, every dollar will go straight to Marlin’s dream.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a mother when you first have a child you get natural instincts to take care of them. One of those new heightened reactions is that you can easily figure out if your baby is crying and what they need to make them happy again. Imagine if your child started crying and there was nothing you could do to stop it. The worst part is that now this cry is all you hear and it has not stopped.  This is how Marlin William's mother feels right now she has been hearing this horrendous cry for help since Marlin was 4 months old. If you were to donate it is not going to stop him from crying but it will help him get a break from all of the tests, surgeries, and many nights spent in the hospital. </p>
<p>Every child deserves to have a normal childhood, but unfortunately Marlin and many other kids in Eastern Tennessee do not have that. In spite of all the pain Marlin has faced recently, he deserves to have a smile on his face and live out his dream. Even if the donation is $1, it will go a long way to putting a smile on Marlin’s face. The Dream Connection fulfills between 60-75 dreams a year, and the dreams range from Disney World to meeting President George W. Bush and many more. Now it is time for Marlin’s dream of being famous with one of his idols come true.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone is in the financial position to donate money, but you can help by making others aware who can. If you spread the word to family and friends about Marlin’s dream, that helps just as much as donating to this cause. The more people who know about Marlin, the better chance we have of making his dream come true. If you would like to know more about The Dream Connection, you can click this <a href=""http://dreamconnection.org/wp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">link</a> and it will take you to their website.

<p>Hello! My name is Jonathan Tomines, a.k.a. The Toe Bro, a foot specialist (Chiropodist) based out of Toronto, Canada. Being a foot specialist is not only my profession but my passion! I grew up watching and helping my father, who was also a Chiropodist for over 30 years, and love my job and helping people with their feet!</p>
<p>Back in March 2017, I started The Toe Bro as a way to share my passion for foot care with the world. In a little over a past year, The Toe Bro Channel has gained a following of <strong>175,000+ YouTube subscribers </strong>with over <strong>40m views</strong>! More importantly, I've been able to share my passion and connect with foot care enthusiasts all over the world!</p>
<p>The team and I are looking forward to bringing more educational seminars to cities across North America. Thank you so much for all your support so far and we can’t wait to bring these events to life. The crowdfunding campaigns will start shortly with an aim to begin the tour in October 2018. We would really appreciate the support of the entire #tbtoes community to make this dream come true. If you would like to get involved, please let us know!</p>
<p>Based on the consistent feedback from the Toe Bro Community and the success of The Toe Bro educational seminar in Toronto, this is the <strong>RIGHT</strong> time to visit cities throughout North America. The Educational Seminar Tour will involve the following dates with more cities to follow in 2019.</p>
<p>New York (Manhattan), NY: Oct 11, 2018</p>
<p><strong>Chicago, IL: Oct 25, 2018</strong></p>
<p>Philadelphia, PA: Nov 8, 2018</p>
<p>Dallas, TX: Nov 29, 2018</p>
<p>Los Angeles, CA: Dec 6, 2018</p>
<p><strong>*** This Indiegogo campaign is for Chicago, IL on October 25, 2018</strong></p>
<p>With the “Step Up Your Footcare 101” Seminar, I’ll break down ways to identify, examine and treat common foot problems like Ingrown Toenails. I’ll also thoroughly discuss the following topics: <br/>​<br/>Patient's Safety + Practitioner Safety<br/>- How to protect yourself and your client<br/>- Cross-Contamination</p>
<p>30 Sec Foot Assessment<br/>- Educate your client about their feet</p>
<p>Common Foot Problems and Solutions<br/>- Fungal nails<br/>- Warts<br/>- Corns/callouses</p>
<p>Post Treatment Care<br/>- Cuts/wounds and Cleaning up<br/>- Follow-up</p>
<p>Education<br/>- Guiding your client with advice</p>
<p>With your contributions, either through ticket purchases for the seminar or small donations, The Toe Bro team will be able to bring educational seminars to cities across North America and share foot care knowledge with others in the industry. This is important as there is not a lot of knowledge currently available in the industry pertaining to foot health and foot care. Every contribution counts so if you would like to help in any way, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you from the bottom of my heart and all the very best to you!</p>
<p>In total, we will need <strong>$7,310 CAD</strong> to fund the seminar. we hope to have<strong> 40 signups</strong> (two classes of 20) for each city and will accommodate with a bigger classroom if more people sign up. The funding will also cover flights for the team, classroom rental, accommodations (Airbnb), car rentals, workbooks, drinks/snacks for the seminar, workbooks, etc.</p>
<p>Also, If you would like to get directly involved and sponsor the team's expenses (flights, accommodations, car rentals, meals), please contact adam@thetoebro.com.</p>
<p>If we do not hit our target goal, we will not be able to host an educational seminar and the funds will be returned to each and every contributor.</p>
<p>Your help is imperative to making the educational seminar series a success. You can contribute by either:</p>
<p>1. Purchasing a ticket to the seminar <br/>2. Contributing with a small donation <br/>3. Resharing the Indiegogo links across your social channels</p>
<p>If you've read this far, I appreciate your time and commitment. This could potentially be the start of something <strong>BIG</strong> and the success of the first <strong>FIVE</strong> Educational Seminars will dictate our plans for future seminars in 2019. Looking forward to visiting your city!</p>

Therefore, I prioritize methods of contributing that maximize the impact of my efforts, and that's where working with psychedelics comes in.</p><h3>Why Psychedelics?</h3><p>Ever since psychedelics first came into popular consciousness in the 1950s and 1960s, research has suggested that there is more to these substances than wacky visuals and unusual thoughts. Indeed, the more recent wave of scientific research into psychedelics in the past few decades has shown incredibly promising results from <a href=""https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mapscontent/research-archive/mdma/PTSDandMDMA.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MDMA’s potential to treat PTSD</a> to <a href=""https://www.insider.com/magic-mushrooms-depression-treatment-ssri-alternative-2019-2?fbclid=IwAR0_SWDf9zgFi2lHWn6l7iTX82e7V51SP7SOL68mbFJleDzpkinGAg3itXU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">psilocybin’s ability to produce mystical states</a> that can conquer depression and make people’s lives more meaningful.  </p><p> </p><p>In addition to these scientific studies, people’s personal experiences also speak volumes.  A simple YouTube search for psychedelics will yield countless results (you may even see <a href=""https://youtu.be/EGwXBOYfHu4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my own popular video</a> from 2014!) of people talking about psychedelics and the profound transformative impact these substances have induced. But this search will also reveal some truly challenging experiences people have had during the psychedelic trips.

Therefore, I prioritize methods of contributing that maximize the impact of my efforts, and that's where working with psychedelics comes in.Why Psychedelics?Ever since psychedelics first came into popular consciousness in the 1950s and 1960s, research has suggested that there is more to these substances than wacky visuals and unusual thoughts. Indeed, the more recent wave of scientific research into psychedelics in the past few decades has shown incredibly promising results from MDMA’s potential to treat PTSD to psilocybin’s ability to produce mystical states that can conquer depression and make people’s lives more meaningful.   In addition to these scientific studies, people’s personal experiences also speak volumes.  A simple YouTube search for psychedelics will yield countless results (you may even see my own popular video from 2014!) of people talking about psychedelics and the profound transformative impact these substances have induced. But this search will also reveal some truly challenging experiences people have had during the psychedelic trips. Some of these challenges are an unavoidable part of the revealing (psyche - mind, delic - manifesting) nature of the experience, but a very significant number of the “bad” experiences brought about by these substances are totally avoidable.  It is this tragedy – that psychedelics have such huge potential to promote healing, self-exploration, and realization, but can also produce totally opposite outcomes if used incorrectly – and this is the very reason that inspired us to found this company.Why Psychedelic Evolution?One of the single biggest roadblocks to the fruitful use of psychedelics is simply the lack of accessible, thorough, and systematic resources which make the journey of preparation, transformation, and integration clear.

</h3> <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Luckily my English is better in writing :)</p>
<p>I'm an electronics hobbyist, much like most of the target market for this device. My involvement with electronics started when I was a kid, but this hobby got completely replaced by programming until several years ago, when it came back strong. I think it's gonna stick for life this time.</p>
<p>Even though I have 20+ years of programming under my belt and I've spent most of my free time in the past few years working with microcontrollers, I'm no electronics engineer. This makes me very nervous about this project, but I have enough confidence in my skills to believe that I can actually pull it off, hence the campaign.</p>
<p>I am currently working as a software developer and I'd like to keep it that way, so, in my view, this entire endeavor is an extension of my hobby, a way to add more substance to it through a long term goal and engagement.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Use cases</h3>
<p><b>1) Getting familiar with new ICs.</b><br/></p>
<p>Probably the most common use case. For example, if I have a new sensor, I hook it up to the proto-talk and go through the initialization sequence, then I try to get it to do its job. When I'm done getting familiar with the chip, I can start writing code that communicates with it, with out going through as many hit and misses as I would have if I didn't do this.</p>
<p><b>2) Testing sub circuits.</b></p>
<p>Sometimes part of a project might misbehave and the only way to rule out bad communication on the bus, is by sniffing it or even taking the role of a master on the bus. (check the gallery for the I2C demo).</p>
<p>On other occasions you may only have to create a module that's not part of anything. When that's the case, testing it involves connecting the module to a device that talks the protocol.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>It connects over USB and shows up as a serial port, so you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A PC with an USB 2 port.</li>
<li>A terminal client that can connect to COM ports. I prefer PuTTY both on Windows and Linux.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Proto-Talk &amp; Compromises (the bad news)</h3>
<p>I start with this because I like to keep the good for last and because I believe it's mandatory that you know the main downfalls of this device before you get all excited about the features. It should also give you enough information to put those features into perspective, when you read about them in the next chapter.</p>
<p>As with all electronic devices, the final product is just a mixture of the compromises you made.<br/></p>
<h4>The main chip<br/>
</h4>
<p>As I said in the video, this is not the first version, there were other versions before, but they all pale in comparison. At its core it's using a STM32F4 chip, which I didn't pick because I had a devboard laying around (which I did), but because it met most of the requirements I had in mind when I started working on this project. Some things are poorly implemented in this chip and they reflect in the limitations of the proto-talk, but I was forced to keep it because it had some other things I needed. You could say that this is the main compromise.</p>
<h4>The baudrate<br/>
</h4>
<p>Again, as said in the video, one of the key features is the low baudrate error. The trick there is that when you're requesting a new baudrate, it reconfigures its entire clock system, from the first PLL divider, down to the peripheral clock. When doing that, it tries to keep the highest core clock it can, while still reaching the desired value, within the specified error. In some cases this leads to other issues (does not affect all peripherals), related to the fact that some operations might not have enough core clock cycles to  complete before the next bit of data needs to be processed. This was another compromise and it's documented in the Limits &amp; Limitations section. As a work around, I plan to add an optional constrain so the baudrate request keeps the core clock to at least x times the peripheral clock,  where x is adjusted to fit the problematic operations.</p>
<h4>USB<br/>
</h4>
<p>Another challenge which lead to another compromise, was the choice of an USB chip. Doesn't the STM32F4 already have a USB peripheral you ask? Well, I didn't want to have USB interrupts messing up any ongoing communication and I didn't want to limit how much the internal clock can change (the USB peripheral needs a specific clock), so I had to delegate that to another chip.</p>
<p>Because the main chip is changing its clock so casually, communication between the F4 and the USB chip had to be done in a very flexible manner, yet as fast as possible. Needless to say, this narrowed it down to a single chip family and a throughoutput of about 6 Mbps (pretty good really, but I was hoping for 10 Mbps).</p>
<p>The current throughoutput is directly related to the core clock, which varies with baudrate and is the main reason why an overflow could happen during tunnel mode. Overflows are indicated with a red LED on the board.</p>
<h4>Output buffers<br/>
</h4>
<p>This was another hard choice, I went through many buffers, both unidirectional and bidirectional ones. I chose the ones I'm currently using because of their rated baudrates and because they could work at the required voltages on both sides.</p>
<p>The current choice is not set in stone, so it might change by the time the final version is out. Remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The nice thing about them is that they are auto-bidirectional, so they don't need to be configured, they just work, which offers a lot of room for new protocol implementations. <b>This is also their downside</b>, being able to automatically switch direction, means that they can't drive big or capacitive loads. If you try to do that, they'll think the other side is trying to drive the line as well and strange things start happening.</p>
<p>Another downside, related to the port B output buffer (the one in charge of I2C, 1-Wire &amp; DHT - basically open drain protocols), is that it has a built in 10k pull-up. This means that it can't be disabled, once the buffer is enabled. I've looked into alternatives, but there doesn't appear to be any sensible solution to it, not without incurring some other major drawbacks. I'll keep looking into it, but at the moment it appears to be the only viable solution.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

</ul>
<p><b>MicroWire</b><br/></p>
<p>It's under development, at the moment it can only talk this protocol, with arbitrary number of bits per opcode (0-16), arbitrary number of bits per address (0-32) and arbitrary number of bits per data value.<br/></p>
<p><b>LIN</b> - needs transceiver, doesn't come with it<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Bus sniffer.</li>
<li>Answer to custom header IDs with predefined messages.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the programmable output level, the required voltage of the card can be detected by simply changing the output voltage of the proto-talk between the standard voltages at which smart cards can operate and running the reset instruction.<br/></p>
<ul></ul>
<p><b>DHT</b></p>
<p>This family of sensors has grown into popularity lately, which is why I included them, I might move them in the future in a section dedicated to particular chips.<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Can read the data from a DHT11 or DHT22 chip</li>
<li>Sniffer</li>
<li>Selectable pullups between 10k, 5k, 3.3k and 2.5k (combination of 5, 10 and the internal 10k one of the output buffer).<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>PWM</b></p>
<p>Rather useless with the current output buffers, since it can't drive any big load (like an LED) nor capacitive loads (like a filter - if the resistor is not big enough).<br/></p>
<p><b>LCD</b> - HD44780 Driver<br/></p>
<p>It allows you to perform most of the functions of the LCD as well as providing a quick test routine.</p>
<p>Support only for the 4-bit mode at the moment, but I also plan to add support for 8-bit mode and sniffing for both modes (this is where the output buffers shine).</p>
<p><b>SD Card Slot &amp; SDK<br/></b></p>
<p>It also comes with a SD card slot that can be used to store programs and modules that proto-talk can run.</p>
<p>At this point I have managed to find files on the SD card, load them, run custom programs and implemented a basic SDK.</p>
<p>This functionality will be there, but it's low priority so I haven't even thought about a proper SDK structure or module structure.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>* Subject to buffer overflow, as the incoming data may come in faster than the speed at which it's going out. A buffer overflow happens when there's incoming data, waiting to be processed, but the internal buffers are already full (with previous data).</p>
<p>** For SPI, the specified baudrate error of less than 0.2% is valid with one exception: 426 bps becomes 427 bps, which represents a baudrate error of 0.23%. In all other cases, the baudrate error is less than 0.18% (holds true for UART as well).<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Possible Features<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Most likely in future firmware updates (after the release date).<br/></p>
<p>1) A rather certain feature is semi-direct port access, so new protocols can be implemented by bitbanging from user code.</p>2) API for a binary mode, so the device can be switched into that mode and controlled via scripts or programs on the PC.<br/><br/><p>3) Logic Analyzer. Even if the buffers are not making it ideal for this task and the little available memory would make it a rather useless LA (about 60 kb of RAM left for that), the fact is that it should still be able to sample data at up to about 40 Mbps. Not a real promise, but it's more than likely that this feature will make its way in there.<br/></p>
<p>There are several things I didn't have enough time to look into, that I would like to add, but can't promise anything. If it is possible to add them, chances are they'll come in later firmware updates.</p>
<p>1) CAN. I took a quick look and it seemed complex enough to delay the launch of this campaign for too long. I postponed looking into it until more important things are done.</p>
<p>2) SD &amp; MMC interface. This is something I'm very excited about and it's sort of top priority after all the basics are done. I went with the SPI mode for the built in SD Card slot because I wanted to have the native SDIO data lines free. They are routed to the two I/O ports of the proto-talk and the plan is to make it talk to cards and chips that talk the native SD / MMC protocol. This, coupled with the 1.2 to 5 V variable output level, could quickly morph it into a very nice and powerful recovery tool (for example for extracting data from broken phones and devices that have such chips).</p>
<p>3) Some sort of support for IR. (very low priority, unless requested by many users)<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>For this section, indiegogo is suggesting me to:</p> <ul>
<li>Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you. </li> <li>Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited!</li> <li>Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Let's start with the first one, why so much and where it's going:</b></p>
<p>For a breakdown:</p>
<p>- Most of it is going on components.<br/>- Another big chunk of it is going to the assembly house (they'll also handle the shipping).<br/>- I also expect to spend about 1k on boards with fast turnaround for the various changes I'll make.<br/>- At this point it looks like I may have to also buy an USB VID ($5000), which I'm not sure how to view, since it's both expensive enough to want to avoid it, but also useful enough to really want one. I'm doing my best to avoid it at the moment, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen.</p>
<p>This leaves us with a rather slim slice for me, which will serve as my motivation to continue working on proto-talk and deliver a finished product.</p>
<p>The way I see it, is that if this campaign gets successfully funded (the required number of devices get sold), it means there's enough interest for the device that I can keep producing it even after the campaign. What I'm trying to avoid is committing long-term, to a time sink that generates no income. I tried offering software for free and it stops being fun when you don't need it anymore, but other people do and they need you to keep working on it.</p>
<p><b>About: Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited!</b></p>
<p>I would hope that the specifications alone got you excited enough :) Personally I'm very excited about it, with or without this campaign.</p>
<p>If it will get overfunded by a lot, I will have to check with the manufacturer and see if I can throw in some additional external goodies. I never did this before, but I suspect it all comes down to the quantities.</p>
<p><b>About: Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.</b><br/></p>
<p>It's fixed funding, so if the goal isn't reached, the funds go back into your pocket.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Delivery</h3>
<p>I hope it will be ready much sooner, but after the ordeal I've been through with the first prototype board (got delayed by one month) and because we all make mistakes, I'm going to take 2 months after this campaign is funded to keep working on it, before going into production.<br/></p>
<p>If everything goes fine and I'm confident that the hardware won't receive any more changes, it might get into production sooner, but things rarely go as you expect them to, so don't get your hopes up.</p>
<p>Another note worthy thing is that it will ship directly from China, so expect the kind of shipping times that the Chinese postal service is offering.<br/></p>
</div><br/><div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Being completely new to this, I can only imagine, but I suppose the worst thing that can happen is that nobody will receive their proto-talk. That's obviously not the plan, but hey... it happened before.</p>
<p>Aside from the risks that arise from working with a foreign assembly house and not being able to overview the entire process, I am only afraid of screwups in the design.</p>
<p>Because of that, I plan to get all the basic firmware features right first, in the idea that possible hardware issues might make themselves visible during this period as well as hardware requirements that I haven't foreseen for the design at hand.</p>
<p>I haven't talked about it with them yet, but I believe the assembly house can do a test run as well, so I'll do that and make sure that what comes out of the factory is at the expected quality.</p>
<p>You should also know that I was already quoted by the assembly house so I don't think there'll be any surprises there.</p>
<p>Given that this is an actual working prototype, I'd say the risks of me spending all the money on R&amp;D are pretty slim :) If nothing goes horribly wrong, some layout changes will be in order and that's about it.</p>
<p>If I decide to try new output buffers and fail, I'll simply revert to the current design and live with the quirks of the current buffers as I described in the previous sections.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Edits</h3>
<p>04-Oct-2014: The Smart Card mode was added.<br/></p>
<p>05-Oct-2014: The baudrate errors were added for SPI &amp; I2C and the SPI baudrate span was changed from ""1 bps to 20 Mbps"" to ""11 bps to 20 Mbps"".<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I don't have a huge social network (actually I only have about 10 friends in my facebook account) and I don't like to spam either, so even if you don't have a use for this, but you know someone who might, please share this campaign with them.<br/></p>

 Hello everyone,
Luckily my English is better in writing :)
I'm an electronics hobbyist, much like most of the target market for this device. My involvement with electronics started when I was a kid, but this hobby got completely replaced by programming until several years ago, when it came back strong. I think it's gonna stick for life this time.
Even though I have 20+ years of programming under my belt and I've spent most of my free time in the past few years working with microcontrollers, I'm no electronics engineer. This makes me very nervous about this project, but I have enough confidence in my skills to believe that I can actually pull it off, hence the campaign.
I am currently working as a software developer and I'd like to keep it that way, so, in my view, this entire endeavor is an extension of my hobby, a way to add more substance to it through a long term goal and engagement.

Use cases
1) Getting familiar with new ICs.
Probably the most common use case. For example, if I have a new sensor, I hook it up to the proto-talk and go through the initialization sequence, then I try to get it to do its job. When I'm done getting familiar with the chip, I can start writing code that communicates with it, with out going through as many hit and misses as I would have if I didn't do this.
2) Testing sub circuits.
Sometimes part of a project might misbehave and the only way to rule out bad communication on the bus, is by sniffing it or even taking the role of a master on the bus. (check the gallery for the I2C demo).
On other occasions you may only have to create a module that's not part of anything. When that's the case, testing it involves connecting the module to a device that talks the protocol.

Requirements
It connects over USB and shows up as a serial port, so you will need:

A PC with an USB 2 port.
A terminal client that can connect to COM ports. I prefer PuTTY both on Windows and Linux.



Proto-Talk & Compromises (the bad news)
I start with this because I like to keep the good for last and because I believe it's mandatory that you know the main downfalls of this device before you get all excited about the features. It should also give you enough information to put those features into perspective, when you read about them in the next chapter.
As with all electronic devices, the final product is just a mixture of the compromises you made.
The main chip

As I said in the video, this is not the first version, there were other versions before, but they all pale in comparison. At its core it's using a STM32F4 chip, which I didn't pick because I had a devboard laying around (which I did), but because it met most of the requirements I had in mind when I started working on this project. Some things are poorly implemented in this chip and they reflect in the limitations of the proto-talk, but I was forced to keep it because it had some other things I needed. You could say that this is the main compromise.
The baudrate

Again, as said in the video, one of the key features is the low baudrate error. The trick there is that when you're requesting a new baudrate, it reconfigures its entire clock system, from the first PLL divider, down to the peripheral clock. When doing that, it tries to keep the highest core clock it can, while still reaching the desired value, within the specified error. In some cases this leads to other issues (does not affect all peripherals), related to the fact that some operations might not have enough core clock cycles to  complete before the next bit of data needs to be processed. This was another compromise and it's documented in the Limits & Limitations section. As a work around, I plan to add an optional constrain so the baudrate request keeps the core clock to at least x times the peripheral clock,  where x is adjusted to fit the problematic operations.
USB

Another challenge which lead to another compromise, was the choice of an USB chip. Doesn't the STM32F4 already have a USB peripheral you ask? Well, I didn't want to have USB interrupts messing up any ongoing communication and I didn't want to limit how much the internal clock can change (the USB peripheral needs a specific clock), so I had to delegate that to another chip.
Because the main chip is changing its clock so casually, communication between the F4 and the USB chip had to be done in a very flexible manner, yet as fast as possible. Needless to say, this narrowed it down to a single chip family and a throughoutput of about 6 Mbps (pretty good really, but I was hoping for 10 Mbps).
The current throughoutput is directly related to the core clock, which varies with baudrate and is the main reason why an overflow could happen during tunnel mode. Overflows are indicated with a red LED on the board.
Output buffers

This was another hard choice, I went through many buffers, both unidirectional and bidirectional ones. I chose the ones I'm currently using because of their rated baudrates and because they could work at the required voltages on both sides.
The current choice is not set in stone, so it might change by the time the final version is out. Remains to be seen.
The nice thing about them is that they are auto-bidirectional, so they don't need to be configured, they just work, which offers a lot of room for new protocol implementations. This is also their downside, being able to automatically switch direction, means that they can't drive big or capacitive loads. If you try to do that, they'll think the other side is trying to drive the line as well and strange things start happening.
Another downside, related to the port B output buffer (the one in charge of I2C, 1-Wire & DHT - basically open drain protocols), is that it has a built in 10k pull-up. This means that it can't be disabled, once the buffer is enabled. I've looked into alternatives, but there doesn't appear to be any sensible solution to it, not without incurring some other major drawbacks. I'll keep looking into it, but at the moment it appears to be the only viable solution.

Specifications and Features
More to come, but currently in the prototype:
Output Levels

1.2 V to 5 V.
1.3 mV of resolution.


USART

1 bps to 10 Mbps @ less than 0.2% baudrate error.
Hardware handshaking mode @ 1 bps to 5 Mbps.

Selectable number of stop bits (between 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 bits).
Synchronous master mode.

Tunnel mode. *

SPI - master only at the moment

11 bps to 20 Mbps @ less than 0.2% baudrate error. **

All 4 SPI modes.

Tunnel mode. *
Separate instruction for CS.


I2C
Standard and Fast Mode (SM & FM).

Allows you to violate the spec and go up to 1 Mbps in both SM and FM @ less than 0.14% baudrate error.
Bus sniffer.
Bus scanner.
Support for 7-bit addresses for now. 10-bit addresses planned.
Selectable pullups between 10k, 5k, 3.3k and 2.5k (combination of 5, 10 and the internal 10k one of the output buffer).
Separate start & stop instructions for more robust commands.


1-Wire

Standard mode for now, overdrive mode to come.
Bus sniffer.

Bus scanner.
Selectable pullups between 10k, 5k, 3.3k and 2.5k (combination of 5, 10 and the internal 10k one of the output buffer).
Can also send individual bits.

MicroWire
It's under development, at the moment it can only talk this protocol, with arbitrary number of bits per opcode (0-16), arbitrary number of bits per address (0-32) and arbitrary number of bits per data value.
LIN - needs transceiver, doesn't come with it

Bus sniffer.
Answer to custom header IDs with predefined messages.
Automatically adds parity bits when sending and also checks them in sniffing.

Smart Card - the ISO 7816-3 protocol

Supports both MSB and LSB communication.
T=0 implemented, T=1 in the works.
Reset instruction with built in control over the VCC line.
ATR interpretation.
Baudrate generation as a function of the clock.
PTS & APDU instructions.


Because of the programmable output level, the required voltage of the card can be detected by simply changing the output voltage of the proto-talk between the standard voltages at which smart cards can operate and running the reset instruction.

DHT
This family of sensors has grown into popularity lately, which is why I included them, I might move them in the future in a section dedicated to particular chips.

Can read the data from a DHT11 or DHT22 chip
Sniffer
Selectable pullups between 10k, 5k, 3.3k and 2.5k (combination of 5, 10 and the internal 10k one of the output buffer).


PWM
Rather useless with the current output buffers, since it can't drive any big load (like an LED) nor capacitive loads (like a filter - if the resistor is not big enough).
LCD - HD44780 Driver
It allows you to perform most of the functions of the LCD as well as providing a quick test routine.
Support only for the 4-bit mode at the moment, but I also plan to add support for 8-bit mode and sniffing for both modes (this is where the output buffers shine).
SD Card Slot & SDK
It also comes with a SD card slot that can be used to store programs and modules that proto-talk can run.
At this point I have managed to find files on the SD card, load them, run custom programs and implemented a basic SDK.
This functionality will be there, but it's low priority so I haven't even thought about a proper SDK structure or module structure.

* Subject to buffer overflow, as the incoming data may come in faster than the speed at which it's going out. A buffer overflow happens when there's incoming data, waiting to be processed, but the internal buffers are already full (with previous data).
** For SPI, the specified baudrate error of less than 0.2% is valid with one exception: 426 bps becomes 427 bps, which represents a baudrate error of 0.23%. In all other cases, the baudrate error is less than 0.18% (holds true for UART as well).


Possible Features


Most likely in future firmware updates (after the release date).
1) A rather certain feature is semi-direct port access, so new protocols can be implemented by bitbanging from user code.2) API for a binary mode, so the device can be switched into that mode and controlled via scripts or programs on the PC.3) Logic Analyzer. Even if the buffers are not making it ideal for this task and the little available memory would make it a rather useless LA (about 60 kb of RAM left for that), the fact is that it should still be able to sample data at up to about 40 Mbps. Not a real promise, but it's more than likely that this feature will make its way in there.
There are several things I didn't have enough time to look into, that I would like to add, but can't promise anything. If it is possible to add them, chances are they'll come in later firmware updates.
1) CAN. I took a quick look and it seemed complex enough to delay the launch of this campaign for too long. I postponed looking into it until more important things are done.
2) SD & MMC interface. This is something I'm very excited about and it's sort of top priority after all the basics are done. I went with the SPI mode for the built in SD Card slot because I wanted to have the native SDIO data lines free. They are routed to the two I/O ports of the proto-talk and the plan is to make it talk to cards and chips that talk the native SD / MMC protocol. This, coupled with the 1.2 to 5 V variable output level, could quickly morph it into a very nice and powerful recovery tool (for example for extracting data from broken phones and devices that have such chips).
3) Some sort of support for IR. (very low priority, unless requested by many users)

  What I Need & What You Get For this section, indiegogo is suggesting me to: 
Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.  Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited! Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.

Let's start with the first one, why so much and where it's going:
For a breakdown:
- Most of it is going on components.- Another big chunk of it is going to the assembly house (they'll also handle the shipping).- I also expect to spend about 1k on boards with fast turnaround for the various changes I'll make.- At this point it looks like I may have to also buy an USB VID ($5000), which I'm not sure how to view, since it's both expensive enough to want to avoid it, but also useful enough to really want one. I'm doing my best to avoid it at the moment, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen.
This leaves us with a rather slim slice for me, which will serve as my motivation to continue working on proto-talk and deliver a finished product.
The way I see it, is that if this campaign gets successfully funded (the required number of devices get sold), it means there's enough interest for the device that I can keep producing it even after the campaign. What I'm trying to avoid is committing long-term, to a time sink that generates no income. I tried offering software for free and it stops being fun when you don't need it anymore, but other people do and they need you to keep working on it.
About: Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited!
I would hope that the specifications alone got you excited enough :) Personally I'm very excited about it, with or without this campaign.
If it will get overfunded by a lot, I will have to check with the manufacturer and see if I can throw in some additional external goodies. I never did this before, but I suspect it all comes down to the quantities.
About: Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.
It's fixed funding, so if the goal isn't reached, the funds go back into your pocket.

Delivery
I hope it will be ready much sooner, but after the ordeal I've been through with the first prototype board (got delayed by one month) and because we all make mistakes, I'm going to take 2 months after this campaign is funded to keep working on it, before going into production.
If everything goes fine and I'm confident that the hardware won't receive any more changes, it might get into production sooner, but things rarely go as you expect them to, so don't get your hopes up.
Another note worthy thing is that it will ship directly from China, so expect the kind of shipping times that the Chinese postal service is offering.
 Risks & Challenges
Being completely new to this, I can only imagine, but I suppose the worst thing that can happen is that nobody will receive their proto-talk. That's obviously not the plan, but hey... it happened before.
Aside from the risks that arise from working with a foreign assembly house and not being able to overview the entire process, I am only afraid of screwups in the design.
Because of that, I plan to get all the basic firmware features right first, in the idea that possible hardware issues might make themselves visible during this period as well as hardware requirements that I haven't foreseen for the design at hand.
I haven't talked about it with them yet, but I believe the assembly house can do a test run as well, so I'll do that and make sure that what comes out of the factory is at the expected quality.
You should also know that I was already quoted by the assembly house so I don't think there'll be any surprises there.
Given that this is an actual working prototype, I'd say the risks of me spending all the money on R&D are pretty slim :) If nothing goes horribly wrong, some layout changes will be in order and that's about it.
If I decide to try new output buffers and fail, I'll simply revert to the current design and live with the quirks of the current buffers as I described in the previous sections.

Edits
04-Oct-2014: The Smart Card mode was added.
05-Oct-2014: The baudrate errors were added for SPI & I2C and the SPI baudrate span was changed from ""1 bps to 20 Mbps"" to ""11 bps to 20 Mbps"".

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul><li>At-Risk Teens</li></ul>
<p>We are partnering with the Department of Corrections to provide a structured system to rehabilitate teens, reintegrate them into society, and provide them with usable skills. Research has shown that it helps reduce the rate of repeat offenders and increase the graduation rate associated with At-Risk teens who participate in similar Equine programs.</p>
<ul><li>Future Programs</li></ul>
<p>We are working on providing therapeutic riding sessions for children with mental and physical disabilities, therapeutic riding for veterans, and a program for human trafficking victims.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need a total of $2.5 million dollars to get all the property, buildings, and start-up equipment needed to open the facility and begin taking on clients.</p>
<p>The projects that the donations would go towards would be: Clearing Pasture Ground, Purchasing 100 more acres, Fencing in New Pastures, and Building an Indoor Riding Arena</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Equine Therapy can improve social skills, physical skills, self-esteem, and concentration. It can help in the development of respect, responsibility, and perseverance. It also can reduce insecurities and fears, as well as assist in rehabilitation. Equine Therapy can assist with Phobias, Psychoses, Aggressiveness, Nervousness, Stress, Shyness, Insomnia, Sedentary Habits, Developmental Delays, Learning Disabilities, Social Problems, Neurological Motor Impairment, Cerebral Palsy, Vascular-cerebral Accidents, Cerebral Trauma, Down Syndrome, Autism, Sensory visual, Auditory or Speech problems, Posture, Equilibrium, Joint Degeneration, Injuries, Amputations, Congenital Defects, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Asthma, Bronchitis, Emphysema, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and PTSD. Healing Hearts will also be involved in horse rescue and adoption. Some horses that are donated need rehabilitation and training. Our troubled teens will assist with integrating the horses into our program and in some cases nursing them back to health.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
At-Risk Teens
We are partnering with the Department of Corrections to provide a structured system to rehabilitate teens, reintegrate them into society, and provide them with usable skills. Research has shown that it helps reduce the rate of repeat offenders and increase the graduation rate associated with At-Risk teens who participate in similar Equine programs.
Future Programs
We are working on providing therapeutic riding sessions for children with mental and physical disabilities, therapeutic riding for veterans, and a program for human trafficking victims.

What We Need
We need a total of $2.5 million dollars to get all the property, buildings, and start-up equipment needed to open the facility and begin taking on clients.
The projects that the donations would go towards would be: Clearing Pasture Ground, Purchasing 100 more acres, Fencing in New Pastures, and Building an Indoor Riding Arena

The Impact
Equine Therapy can improve social skills, physical skills, self-esteem, and concentration. It can help in the development of respect, responsibility, and perseverance. It also can reduce insecurities and fears, as well as assist in rehabilitation. Equine Therapy can assist with Phobias, Psychoses, Aggressiveness, Nervousness, Stress, Shyness, Insomnia, Sedentary Habits, Developmental Delays, Learning Disabilities, Social Problems, Neurological Motor Impairment, Cerebral Palsy, Vascular-cerebral Accidents, Cerebral Trauma, Down Syndrome, Autism, Sensory visual, Auditory or Speech problems, Posture, Equilibrium, Joint Degeneration, Injuries, Amputations, Congenital Defects, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Asthma, Bronchitis, Emphysema, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and PTSD. Healing Hearts will also be involved in horse rescue and adoption. Some horses that are donated need rehabilitation and training. Our troubled teens will assist with integrating the horses into our program and in some cases nursing them back to health.

Other Ways You Can Help

We also offer two sponsorship options if you would like to sponsor a horse or an individual in the program. You can do this through our Paypal link. https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xc... 
You can also help through volunteering. We are always in need of volunteers in many different positions. Volunteer options can range from: teaching skilled labor to At-Risk teens, working with horses, building fences, arenas, and stalls, assisting as horse walkers or side walkers for special needs children, future event planners, or assisting in fundraising.

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>When I was 13 years old, I was certain I wanted to die. Life just seemed too <i>heavy</i>. It felt like someone had put a soaking wet blanket on top of me and I couldn't breathe. I couldn't see where the escape was. Hell, I couldn't see anything at all. I could only feel. Feel the tightness in my throat, the rapid beating of my heart that didn't feel right, the burn of tears behind my eyes, the desire to just stop. Stop trying, stop being scared, stop being sad, stop existing. </p>
<p>I made it through this part of my life and it wouldn't be the last time I was absolutely sure that I didn't want to live anymore. Every time, something pushed me through it - a family member, a friend, a desire for something more.</p>
<p>Most recently, I've been burdened with new and scarier, but still similar feelings to those I had 11 years ago and a few other times since. Rediscovering and throwing myself into yoga practice has been like someone cut a hole in that wet blanket for me to breathe out of. Every time I go to a yoga class, that hole gets a little bit bigger and for the first time in my life, <strong>I see a way out of it. </strong></p>
<p>Yoga has served as a channel to get out the anxiety that tends to dominate my everyday, that electric energy flowing through me, threatening to shock me at any moment. By focusing on my movements, my poses, my breathing, I am being mindful and allowing those anxious thoughts to exist, but not consume me. Rather than pretending those thoughts don't exist, ultimately giving them more power over me, I am able to acknowledge them, then let them float away, shifting focus back into holding a pose or maintaining my breathing (or wiping sweat off my forehead because even not-hot yoga is more work than you think).</p>
<p>Yoga has given me a renewed appreciation for my body and my mind. It's so easy to go to a class and look at everyone practicing around me and think:</p>
<ul>
<li>""Why can't I hold a balance for as long as they can?""</li>
<li>""Why can they do a split/handstand/weird pose I don't know and I can't?""</li>
<li>""How can they afford to wear all LuLuLemon to class and I'm rocking Target leggings?""</li>
</ul>
<p>But once class starts and really gets going, I'm able to let that slip away. My intention for a class is almost always ""appreciate your body and mind for what it can do today."" And yoga has done just that for me - given me gratitude and grace for myself in a world that is hellbent on having us be hard on ourselves.</p>
<p>Enough about me though - how does this actually impact other people? Just because I have mental illness and needed help doesn't mean that everyone else does, right? Not quite.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/issues/state-mental-health-america"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1 in 5 adults in the US have a mental health condition - that's more than the populations of Florida and New York combined.</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/issues/state-mental-health-america"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Youth mental health is getting worse - percentage of youths with <strong>severe</strong> depression is increasing year over year, with 75% of those youth not getting sufficient treatment.</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db303.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Women are almost <i>twice</i> as likely to have depression.</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db303.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Depression increases as family income levels decrease.</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/issues/state-mental-health-america"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>9.6 million</strong> people in the US experience suicidal ideations.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I want other people to find the self-worth, grace, calm, and resilience I've found through my practice and I want to help them do it. Once I get my certification, I'll be seeking opportunities to teach courses to populations that need it most, like those mentioned in the statistics above - women, young adults, low income populations, anyone suffering from mental illness - who also happen to typically be the people who can't afford it. (Yoga is expensive, people!! That's why I'm crowdfunding my certification!)</p>
<p>I'm a volunteer at <a href=""http://www.interactofwake.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">InterAct</a>, a non-profit in Raleigh that serves women and children that are victims of domestic and sexual abuse. Once certified, I'm going to work with the volunteer coordinators there to teach classes for InterAct's clients, who are most in need and deserving of grace and self-love. </p>
<p>Long term, I'm hoping to identify a non-profit that will allow me to bring free yoga to young adults who struggle with mental illness because right now, there just aren't enough resources for them. There is a huge nationwide shortage of mental health professionals, which, compounded with rising medical costs and a general stigma around seeking treatment for mental illness, means that way to many young adults are struggling without help. They deserve a better quality of life and I want to do everything I can to give it to them. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, courses aren't cheap! They start at around $2,000 and can get up to $3,200+ when you include costs for books and additional yoga practice. Should you choose to contribute, your donation will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>RYT-200 tuition</li>
<li>Any materials needed for the course (i.e. books)</li>
<li>Cost of shipping for any ~perks~ I'll be sending you</li>
</ul>
<p>If somehow I exceed my goal, I will be donating any additional funds raised to <a href=""http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mental Health America</a>. </p>
<p>I want to clarify that my primary goal in getting this certification is to serve underprivileged communities, <strong>not</strong> to profit off of this certification. Since I don't plan to turn any real profit off of this for the time being, it's difficult to cover the cost on my own. I work full-time and have allllll the bills (just like everyone else, I know) so I don't have the time to pick up a full-on second job. My hope is that since I plan to give back to the community with this certification, that my community will invest in me first.</p>
<h3>What?</h3>
<p>I feel icky and weird about just asking people for donations so with each contribution you get a lil something back! I've outlined the ~perks~ per donation but please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have an idea for a different perk or an amount you don't see listed or would just rather venmo me. I'm definitely flexible (predisposed to be a yoga teacher, amirite? Sorry - bad joke). </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Oh, One More Thing!</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, I totally and completely understand - that's why I'm asking the community for help, because I feel that strain!</p>
<p>If you don't feel comfortable contributing financially, I also completely understand that - if you feel comfortable helping to spread the word about my campaign via social media/email/word of mouth, then that would be just as appreciated as a financial contribution.</p>
<p>And if you don't feel comfortable spreading the word, hey, I get that too - everyone has a brand to keep up on social media - please just send some positive vibes my way :) </p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your consideration, kindness, and positive vibes!</p>
<p>Peace n blessings,</p>

<h3>Why Support Womb?</h3>
<p>Would you like to follow the advice of your care providers, 'going with the flow' and not quite sure about you choices?</p>
<p>Or would you rather know why your midwife or doctor is suggesting a particular test, be fully aware of what all your options are and rock your birth by knowing in advance what is available to you?</p>
<p>If you are the latter<i> - then you will want to support Womb.</i> Womb is dedicated to providing unbiased information so that women can make informed pregnancy and birth choices. With your help, Womb can become a registered not-for-profit and have a comprehensive website built, complete with national maternity services directory.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Womb wants to empower women and men.</strong>  Birth stories of women feeling that they were treated as simply bodies that produced a baby, are mounting.  More and more women are vocalising that their births were negative experiences, even traumatic. Some new fathers are also expressing shock at how their partners were treated. Experiences like this can lead to postnatal depression for both mums and dads. This is not a happy start to parenthood.</p>
<p>Pregnancy is a special time to learn and wonder about the little being growing inside. Birth is a magical moment when parents finally get to meet that new person for the first time. It should not be filled with feelings of doubt, helplessness and fear. With more information, women and couples can be in charge of the decision making and be active participants in the growth and birth of their child. <strong><i>Empowered women and men who have been supported by their care providers make for great new mothers and fathers!</i></strong></p>
<p>Did you know that care varies between hospitals in the same city?</p>
<p>Womb intends to highlight these differences, that women and families can find the care that best suits their needs. For example, a woman who wishes to birth her breech baby naturally is more likely to achieve this if the hospital has trained staff who support it. Some public hospitals offer a homebirth option, while others don't. And some women will need specialised care that can only be provided by a specific hospital and highly trained staff. <i>Knowing in advance what is available and where can alleviate a lot of stress and worry.</i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Womb Needs</h3>
<p>The financial goal of this campaign is based on the finances needed to create a not-for-profit and build an awesome website and directory. </p>
<p>This is what the estimated set-up expenses for Womb looks like:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">   ​<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530458872/j3s8rl6ogn8f9yaxbqia.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As you can see, the majority of expenses for setting up Womb are not actually building the website, but ensuring that it meets legal requirements and that it is a registered not-for-profit organisation. The total costs approximately come to $5000. </p>

</div></div>","Why Support Womb?
Would you like to follow the advice of your care providers, 'going with the flow' and not quite sure about you choices?
Or would you rather know why your midwife or doctor is suggesting a particular test, be fully aware of what all your options are and rock your birth by knowing in advance what is available to you?
If you are the latter - then you will want to support Womb. Womb is dedicated to providing unbiased information so that women can make informed pregnancy and birth choices. With your help, Womb can become a registered not-for-profit and have a comprehensive website built, complete with national maternity services directory.
 
The Impact
Womb wants to empower women and men.  Birth stories of women feeling that they were treated as simply bodies that produced a baby, are mounting.  More and more women are vocalising that their births were negative experiences, even traumatic. Some new fathers are also expressing shock at how their partners were treated. Experiences like this can lead to postnatal depression for both mums and dads. This is not a happy start to parenthood.
Pregnancy is a special time to learn and wonder about the little being growing inside. Birth is a magical moment when parents finally get to meet that new person for the first time. It should not be filled with feelings of doubt, helplessness and fear. With more information, women and couples can be in charge of the decision making and be active participants in the growth and birth of their child. Empowered women and men who have been supported by their care providers make for great new mothers and fathers!
Did you know that care varies between hospitals in the same city?
Womb intends to highlight these differences, that women and families can find the care that best suits their needs. For example, a woman who wishes to birth her breech baby naturally is more likely to achieve this if the hospital has trained staff who support it. Some public hospitals offer a homebirth option, while others don't. And some women will need specialised care that can only be provided by a specific hospital and highly trained staff. Knowing in advance what is available and where can alleviate a lot of stress and worry.
 

What Womb Needs
The financial goal of this campaign is based on the finances needed to create a not-for-profit and build an awesome website and directory. 
This is what the estimated set-up expenses for Womb looks like:
   ​
As you can see, the majority of expenses for setting up Womb are not actually building the website, but ensuring that it meets legal requirements and that it is a registered not-for-profit organisation. The total costs approximately come to $5000.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Good for humanity but a bad business = Community backing needed</strong></p>
<p>Although this is needed all over the world right now, there is no long term business potential. When people stop getting infected, VirusTIM will run out of customers.  This is why it needs to be a community project with your backing.</p>
<h2>The problem: Coronavirus &amp; COVID-19 </h2>
<p>Our communities are overwhelmed by COVID-19. The disease caused by the coronavirus. It has forced us to shut down our economy, close our schools and is overwhelming our healthcare system. You are living the experience. I do not need to tell you about it.</p>
<h2>The solution: VirusTIM (Contact Tracing and Isolation Management) </h2>
<p><strong>In New Zealand, Taiwan, and China</strong> contact tracing and isolation management has shown to be very effective in slowing and stopping the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. </p>
<p><strong>VirusTIM (Contact Tracing and Isolation Management)</strong> will automate and manage the process of contact tracing and isolation management with the use of a mobile smart phone app and a desktop application. The VirusTIM application will also manage the delivery of food, medicine and services to those who are sick in isolation but not sick enough to go to the hospital. Over 80% of people with COVID-19 do not need to be hospitalized, but many of these people need to be looked after in isolation because they either live alone or have high risk family members that they do not want to infect.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587155141/mdxx4hwc5xn3s5iwjxzl.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Contact tracing and isolation management requires a huge effort</strong> by a large number of people. People working in call centers, calling everyone who was in contact with a confirmed case and field support personnel who do testing, deliver meals, medicines and support to those in isolation. In the city of Wuhan, there were over 9,000 people doing contact tracing for just one city. Tens of thousands of people will be needed in the United States for many cities.</p>
<p><strong>The United States is Failing </strong>in their contact tracing and isolation efforts. The US front line against the coronavirus is staffed by county health officials. It is their job to identify and isolate people who have been exposed to the coronavirus. The problem is that they do not have good tools and they have become overwhelmed with the number of cases. VirusTIM will help in managing the recruitment of large teams to do contact tracing and isolation management.</p>
<p><strong>No other options are available </strong>to manage contact tracing and isolation. There are mobile apps available that do individual tracking. They use wireless Bluetooth to detect and record who is around them. Although these mobile apps are categorized as contact tracing they are actually tracking apps that may not be tolerated by Americans because of the invasion of privacy.</p>
<h2>Why we need your support</h2>
<p>In order for our economies to return to normal we need to take a more proactive approach to reducing the spread of the coronavirus. VirusTIM will help communities in their campaign against coronavirus. It does not make a good business proposition because when people stop getting infected it will run out of customers. For this reason it needs the backing of people in the community like you.</p>
<h2>Other ways to support the project</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to help us is by sharing our Indiegogo project page to your friends and institutions who will be interested in and want to support this project. If you would like to support this project in other ways. Please reach out to me here on Indiegogo.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p><strong>Primary Goal: Raise 17K! - Basic Mobile and Desktop Application.</strong> This is a very low cost for a system consisting of both mobile and desktop applications. I set the primary goal low so that if there is little interest at least something will get done. In a basic way, it will work for doing contact tracing and isolation management. It will be available for future epidemics in any country on earth.</p>
<p>Basic website, desktop and mobile application for the management of tasks in support of contact tracing and isolation management.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile and Desktop app with cloud code and website.</li>
<li>Ability to sign up users and patients.</li>
<li>Create and assign tasks to users.</li>
<li>Maintain a task summary for each patient.</li>
<li>Task reminders for patient service providers.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<p><strong>Stretch goal #1: Raise 50K! Extended Features and Offline Support.</strong> If we raise 50K, we will be able to create a fully featured system consisting of mobile and desktop application connected to the cloud for data storage. It will work offline during intermittent connection outages. (Necessary for rural and third world communities.) It will include wizards, management reports and automated communications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Offline support so that the mobile application can continue to work when not connected to the Internet.</li>
<li>Wizard like questionnaire for the contact tracers to follow.</li>
<li>Progress reports for the desktop management application.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal #2 Raise 100K! THE NEED FOR SPEED! </strong>This is more realistic for an application of this size done fast! At this level of funding we can utilize our network of highly skilled outside contractors. The previous goals are based on doing much of the work in-house at a discount. Although a much lower cost, doing this project entirely in-house means it will take longer to finish. Using freelance contractors means it will get done much faster but more expensive.</p>
<p>Help documentation, training videos and multiple language support. Not only will we need to teach people how to use the apps. We will also need to teach them how to do contact tracing and isolation support services. Health Departments are not in a position to scale their personnel resources so we will need to create the training content for them.</p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Creating applications for contact tracing and isolation management is not an overly complex problem. It lacks a long term business model so businesses will not step up to the challenge. When people stop getting infected, VirusTIM will run out of customers. This is why it is best as a community backed project. I am confident in our ability to create the mobile, desktop and cloud components. Once completed VirusTIM will be the solution to managing large teams of contact tracers and people in isolation. I am confident that this project will work, but I also understand and acknowledge that there are always risks and challenges to any project and this isn't different. Despite our planning and utmost execution efforts, I understand that there might be circumstances that are out of our control. If we are met with these, I promise to be transparent and communicate them to you!</p>

You can also find us on Twitter (629 @TPNC629 ・Cockatoo @Cockato47613097) and many supporters through #FreeHoneyTheDolphin   #SaveHoneyTheDolphin and #savehoney  #イルカのハニー .Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.  Please also consider sharing this campaign with your family, your friends, on social media and around you. 2018年1月の犬吠埼マリンパークの閉館に伴い、一頭のイルカ及び多数のペンギン、爬虫類、魚が一年以上も悲惨な飼育環境下の暮らしを強いられている事態は、TV・新聞等の報道で既にご存知の方も多いでしょう。この件は各国でも報道され、千葉県知事・銚子市長・環境省等に多数の抗議電話、メール等も届き、署名運動の結果も提出されましたが、依然として動物達の救出に向かう進展の気配はありません。そこで私達( Mayumi Tanida / Tomoyo Tamatani / Amie Christine )は、募金活動の収益で動物達を犬吠埼マリンパークから購入する事が可能であると考え、皆様にもご協力をお願いする次第です。私達の最大の目的は、以前太地のイルカ漁で捕獲され、娯楽の為に水族館で使用された哀れなイルカのハニーを他の水族館へ移動させるのではなく、彼女の身体の状態が許す限り海外の愛護団体等の協力を得て、サンクチュアリへの移送を実現させる事です。私達はハニーが他の水族館へ移動する事はすなわち、彼女の残りの生涯が再び娯楽に使用されると定義し、それはハニーにとって不適切であると考えます。彼女もイルカが本来住むべき”海”で暮らす事を心から願っているはずです。ペンギン等はJAZAに協力を依頼し、日本/海外の水族館へ移送する予定です。Updates欄にて経過報告掲載を予定しておりますので、皆様にも確認して頂けます。この募金の目標金額は $300,000 (米ドル) で、動物達の購入資金及びサンクチュアリへ移送するまでに生じる様々な費用に使われる予定です。募金設定期間は60日間です。余剰金は日本/海外の動物福祉団体へ寄付されます。募金目標額に達成しない場合は自動的に返金されます。仮に目標額に達成した場合、以上で述べた計画が予定通りに進展しない事も予想されます。その際、希望者には返金致します。残りの寄付金は日本/海外の動物福祉団体等へ再び寄付されます。進捗状況はその都度公表しますので、Updates欄やメールを忘れずに確認するようお願い致します。又、動物福祉団体・自然保護団体に限り、寄付希望の団体のリクエストも考慮します。寄付先・金額はレシートも添付の上、Updates欄にて公表します。返金について、詳しくはFAQをご覧ください。犬吠埼マリンパークの動物達の救出に対する呼びかけは、ツイッターの#イルカのハニーや#savehoney  #FreeHoneyTheDolphin  #SaveHoneyTheDolphin 等でも大勢の応援者により行われています。この募金活動に対する質問等は私達のツイッターのアカウント (629 @TPNC629 ・Cockatoo @Cockato47613097) でも受け付けています。募金の趣旨にご理解とご賛同を頂き、是非、募金にご協力とご支援を頂きますようお願い申し上げます。",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Olufemi Bakare, I am a Lagos based I.T professional in Nigeria. I am raising funds to support my wife's medical bills in excess of $12,000. We have exhausted our personal savings, our extended family's savings and have huge debts and loans to payback.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My wife Temitope fondly known as Temmy had a road traffic accident on the 29th of March, 2018. She fractured her right humerus (upper arm bone) alonngside other minor injuries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Initially she underwent a surgery at Avon specialist hospital in Lagos called open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). A titanium plate was used to fix the bones in place. Shortly after the surgery, the suture site became infected. We battled the infection and after series of unsuccessful antibiotics treatment, her arm had to be re-operated upon for ""debridement"" and ""wash out"" on the 12th of May, 2018.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Post debridement, she endured severe pain by the second and numerous antibiotic injections; augumentin 1g IM &amp; oral, rocephin IM, ceftazidime bestnum IM and ceftazidime fortum IM. None of this worked which led us to seeking second opinion(s).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We consulted with Ortho-surgeons at the Cedar Crest hospital in Abuja. After consultations with consultants, we were informed that her case had became a ""septic non-union"" fracture which meant the titanium plates had to be removed, an external fixation was implanted whilst the infection is controlled prior to extensive bone grafting surgery to reconstruct her right humerus. All her medical report and related pictures can be found <a href=""https://photos.app.goo.gl/doUwWQnw9ssporbS7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18tJUYa7vcAU-T0Xc6AYxrK79AgVxZZdD?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She is currently recovering from the surgery in the hospital with external fixation placed in her arm. We do not have a dime for the next surgery, as it is we can barely feed.</p>
<p>I want my wife to regain the use of her right hand and hopefully  be able to hold and carry our son again.</p>
<p>I appeal to you all for your help, please donate to SAVE TEMITOPE'S RIGHT HAND.</p>

<p>Somos Johanna Hernández y Eduardo Sierra. Una pareja que comienza en el 2017 junto a unos amigos la idea de hacer un evento con información académica sobre veganismo, nutrición, activismo y la importancia que tiene actualmente para direccionar el impacto ambiental, de consumo y económico en el mundo. SALÓN SÉPTIMO SENTIDO inicio a finales de 2017 cuando empezamos a contactar a varios pensadores, académicos y profesionales nacionales e internacionales en Latinoamérica -especialmente de Chile y Argentina- y vimos su gran interés por venir a nuestro país Colombia y participar como conferencistas en este proyecto educativo sobre el tema. Actualmente los conferencistas, artistas, talleristas y expositores que van a participar están comprometidos con esta gran causa para exponer sus conocimientos para todas las personas además de sus múltiples seguidores. NECESITAMOS TU CONTRIBUCIÓN PARA HACER REAL ESTE SUEÑO DEL SALÓN SÉPTIMO SENTIDO 2018. Queremos fomentar a través de la educación este cambio positivo y sin duda ustedes son parte de él.

<h3>On Sunday September 30th 2018, over 120,000 distinguished gentlefolk in over 650 cities worldwide will don their cravats, tustle their ties, press their tweed, and sit astride their classic and vintage styled motorcycles to raise funds and awareness for men’s health, specifically prostate cancer and men's mental health.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Distinguished Gentleman’s Ride was founded in Sydney, Australia by Mark Hawwa. It was inspired by a photo of Mad Men’s Don Draper astride a classic bike and wearing his finest suit. Mark decided a themed ride would be a great way to combat the often-negative stereotype of men on motorcycles, whilst connecting niche motorcycle communities together. <br/><br/>That first ride in 2012 brought together over 2,500 riders across 64 cities. The success of the event encouraged the founder to consider how it could be used to support a worthy cause.</p>

<p>Influenced by the tragedy of losing one of our ride hosts to depression, from 2016 we have seen a change in our health fundraising goals.

<p>Hairy Henry is a real horse – and also the name of our Therapeutic Riding Centre. We started our work in 2013 and have been reaching out to many families since and been able to support them.</p>
<p>We have three horses and a pony, and together with some volunteers, we make a therapy team. This team is for people of all ages – but mostly children – who have special needs due to Autism or ADHD. They often struggle in school, and so they come and visit us here on our tiny farm in the west of Ireland, and spend time working with the horses.</p>
<p>Therapeutic Riding can literally mean riding - with or without a saddle - but sometimes it’s more appropriate to just do some brushing, or sorting out the hay or playing games while you’re on the horse. Whatever suits best. And whatever we do, a relationship is built between the child and the horse – a relationship of trust and respect.</p>
<p>Hairy Henry, Flora, Winnie and Daisy are incredible horses. They are gentle and patient and they help the child achieve their goals, whatever extra needs he or she has. That’s a really powerful experience to have if you’re young and struggling with life – to have a huge, hairy, strong, soft, warm horse on your side. It means a lot to our clients, and they often spend the session laughing and learning and gaining skills - and their confidence grows with each session.</p>
<p>We don’t get any financial support from anywhere, and we can’t charge much for the sessions, so we’re always strapped for cash. These little bottle-openers are a way for us to spread the word about what we do and, if we’re successful with the campaign, earn a little money too.</p>
<p>Our work carries with it large overheads - all animals need to be fed even if they don't work, and they need care and medical attention and equipment. With the wet weather continuing into spring, and all our work taking place outdoors, it can be hard going at times.</p>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you will help us make our work more widely known and support us to keep going into summer and beyond.</p>
<p>But you won't only support Hairy Henry and what we do here – not at all! These bottle openers are art pieces that Tim designed and makes in his workshop - and we’re proud of them. And of course, they open bottles too!</p>
<p>They're made of steel, polished smooth and then waxed. That's it - nothing fancy, just a good-looking functional friendly design. We hope you like it : -  )</p>
<p>So, please spread the word about our campaign amongst your friends and share!</p>

<p><strong>The Long Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a poor, sad leetle boy from Russia named Mishka.</p>
<p>Life was hard in the Fatherland: bread lines, limited pop music, and a severe lack of recreational water features. In fact, Mishka’s life was so hard, and sad, that he took comfort in the small things: Almond Roca. His silky blond ringlets. Warm baths.</p>
<p>Yes—baths. Little Mishka’s safe place. Where water, warm as Borscht soup, hugged his body in unconditional love. The love, he knew, he’d never get from a distant father and a mother who, though supportive, worked tirelessly to bring home the (uncooked) bacon.</p>
<p>Though his nightly ritual did give poor, sad leetle Michka great comfort, bathing in Russia was no simple indulgence. Water had to be heated in a pot over a wood fire and poured by hand into a horse trough lined in splinters, that only came out one of two temperatures: boil-your-skin-off hot, or couldn’t-even-steep-tea tepid. No bubbles, no jets, no beer holders. Not even a hint of a waterfall.</p>
<p>Poor, sad leetle Mishka dreamed of a day—or maybe even a place—where water flowed like wine, and could be heated to precisely 104 degrees. Where tubs were roomy, and the ladies got naked. Mishka knew this place existed—and yearned to park his sore, aching body there.</p>
<p><strong>This place, he was told, was called The United States of America. </strong>In this strange, puritanical land of cleanliness, he heard that baths were so commonplace, people even took them standing up. Liquid, hot as lava, rained down from the heavens, through faucets and fixtures of gold—and Mishka wanted in. All in.</p>
<p>So with nothing but a PVC pipe and a dream, Mishka immigrated to the U.S. to train to become a world-class—or just a really, really decent—plumber, working with hoses, tubs, heaters, and caulk. All things he knew might one day come in handy should a poor, sad leetle boy from Russia ever achieve his ultimate American Dream: proud owner of a tub of his own.</p>
<p>But of course, Mishka knew that<strong> </strong>when it comes to one’s dreams—you should <strong>never aim low</strong>. So he set his sights on an LED lit, bluetooth-enabled, 3-pump, 90-jet jacuzzi hydrotherapy <i>experience</i>. A 6-person heated mini-pool with cascading water, a lounging seat, and yes, a waterfall. </p>
<p><strong>But hot tubs do not grow on trees—not even in the fertile Garden State.</strong> Mishka knew if he wanted a slice of this American (pecan) pie, he’d have to beg, borrow or steal to get it (or at least, get caught across state lines carrying too much of it). So he cut corners, got caught. Did some hard time.</p>
<p>Though he entered the slammer a poor leetle Russian boy—he left a fully-formed, resolute Russki man, more determined than ever. And now, well-equipped with his own plumbing business, a home in the suburbs, and a spacious, landscaped backyard—just the right size for a deluxe, high-end hot tub—it started to seem to those who knew him best, that Mishka was more than ready, and deserving, of tub ownership. He just needed a little help from his friends. </p>
<p>Like Mishka's closest and most-trusted childhood comrade, the unusually well-toned Mr. ""Rob"" Zilla Lobster II, North Jersey's most in-demand electrician. Mr. Lobster gave up many an evening (and therefore countless sexual conquests) upgrading Mishka's electrical system, just so it could withstand the tub of Mishka's wet, hot dreams. As well, his always-cheery, sweet Aunt Narnia, a great lover and supporter of the (cardboard) Arts, left a great deal of her estate, pet raccoons, and novelty inflatable sculpture collection to this dear and noble cause when she recently passed on to a better life (in Brooklyn), RIP. Not to mention Mishka's top customer and dearest confidant, the brilliant and incomparably suave real estate mogul Pasha “Paul” Spashadore of Nikulin Enterprises, who even offered to <i>buy </i>Mishka a hot tub—just out of the pure kindness of his heart. But alas, the offer was too generous. Mishka had to refuse. This was one human-sized pot of water he’d have to boil himself. </p>
<p><strong>Or if not himself…with a whole gang of collective—and specifically financial—love and support. And that's where you come in, Friend. </strong></p>
<p>Let's ALL help poor, dear old Mishka p<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>ursue his unalienable rights to life, liberty, and </span>soaking<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> freely, out-of-doors with friends, intoxicated, until wrinkles and heat stroke force him inside. It's the American way! Manifest destiny! Let's all build this dream together...and then fill it with water, shock it with chemicals, and step gingerly inside. </span></p>
<p><strong>The Short Answer: </strong> Because you'll get stuff. Or at least get to <i>talk</i> about getting stuff.</p>

<p>I am so passionate about sharing the incredible healing modality of breathwork with others.</p>
<p>I have been inspired to study breathwork in depth and train to deepen my understanding and capacity to share this with others for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, my father suffers with COPD, which is distressing, and a daily reminder of the importance of our breath and the impact this has on the quality of our lives.</p>
<p>Secondly, as a yoga teacher I hear people saying every day that they can't get the breathing right, or their breathing feels back to front, stuck, or they can't take a long deep breath.</p>
<p>Thirdly I grew up in a family where my sister had brittle asthma, I would spend many a long night massaging her back and breathing with her to alleviate the symptoms.</p>

First off thank you for clicking on this link!!</p><p>My names Jireh, Jireh L. Drake and I am just a young Black TGNC artist and activist, who is trying to fix my teeth and be in less pain, let me tell you about it..</p><p>So for the past three years I have been experiencing intense teeth pains. However, now that I am more financially stable and college isn’t gnawing at my brain/existence, I decided to figure out what was going on in my mouth. I started this process back in September.  I thought I only needed to remove my wisdom teeth but I also learned I needed a root canal. That is about $1900 that I have to pay up front and in full before my parents insurance will partly reimburse me.</p><p>My appointments were scheduled months out, in this time I worked a few extra art jobs, used my savings and borrowed money from my family to scrounge together this money, while holding all other life expenses.

Hello! Hello! First off thank you for clicking on this link!!My names Jireh, Jireh L. Drake and I am just a young Black TGNC artist and activist, who is trying to fix my teeth and be in less pain, let me tell you about it..So for the past three years I have been experiencing intense teeth pains. However, now that I am more financially stable and college isn’t gnawing at my brain/existence, I decided to figure out what was going on in my mouth. I started this process back in September.  I thought I only needed to remove my wisdom teeth but I also learned I needed a root canal. That is about $1900 that I have to pay up front and in full before my parents insurance will partly reimburse me.My appointments were scheduled months out, in this time I worked a few extra art jobs, used my savings and borrowed money from my family to scrounge together this money, while holding all other life expenses.

<p>J’ai perdu une partie de mon âme. Mon bel <strong>Eldorado</strong>, mon amour, ma muse est parti.</p>
<p><strong>Eldo</strong> était à l’origine du projet,  j’ai besoin de prendre un peu de recul… Je tiens toujours au projet d’un centre d’<strong>oxygénothérapie pour chiens</strong>, car d’autres chiens en auront besoin un jour… mais je me sens moins dans l’urgence, c’est pourquoi j’ai décidé d'annuler la campagne de financement et de rembourser tous les contributeurs.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>*** English follows *** </strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(please be indulgent for the English version, it is not my first language) </i></p>
<h3>Objectif</h3>
<p>Offrir aux gens la possibilité de louer un caisson hyperbare portable pour aider leur chien à recouvrer la santé ou à améliorer leur condition grâce à l’oxygénothérapie hyperbare (OHB) à basse pression. </p>
<h3>Qu’est-ce que l’oxygénothérapie hyperbare à basse pression?</h3>
<p>L’oxygénothérapie hyperbare à basse pression consiste à faire respirer de l’oxygène à une pression supérieure à la pression atmosphérique. L’oxygène sous pression pénètre plus facilement dans les liquides du corps et aide à régénérer les cellules de tous les tissus et organes.</p>
<p>L’animal, accompagné d’un humain, est installé dans un caisson étanche faiblement pressurisé à 1,3 ATA, ce qui équivaut à une plongée sous-marine à 4 mètres de profondeur. </p>
<h3>Quels sont les avantages de l’oxygénothérapie hyperbare à basse pression (1,3 ATA)?</h3>
<p>De nombreux effets bénéfiques sont reconnus et documentés. L’OHB à basse pression active les cellules réparatrices ainsi que les mécanismes de réparation cellulaire. Elle stimule la revascularisation cellulaire et la cicatrisation des tissus et organes. Elle combat l’inflammation et favorise l’élimination des métaux lourds neurotoxiques. Des recherches scientifiques ont également démontré l’efficacité de l’OHB à basse pression dans le traitement de conditions neurologiques chroniques ou aiguës.</p>
<p>Voici quelques exemples de conditions qui peuvent être améliorées avec l’OHB :</p>
<ul>
<li>Épilepsie, car l’OHB augmente la production de glutathion peroxydase et favorise l’oxygénation des vaisseaux sanguins du cerveau en plus d'avoir un effet anti-inflammatoire.</li>
<li>Maladie de Lyme, car l’OHB augmente l’efficacité de certains antibiotiques.</li>
<li>Fractures, brûlures et autres blessures, car l’OHB favorise une guérison plus rapide.</li>
<li>Pré et post opératoire, car l’OHB favorise la vascularisation.</li>
<li>Cancer, car les cellules cancéreuses n’aiment pas l’oxygène.</li>
</ul>
<p>L’OHB aide également à diminuer les symptômes de la fatigue chronique et de la fibromyalgie (réduit la douleur et l’inflammation) chez l’humain.</p>
<p>Autres avantages de l’OHB :</p>
<ul>
<li>Améliore les performances sportives</li>
<li>Augmente l'endurance</li>
<li>Aide à récupérer après un effort intense</li>
<li>Réduit l'acide lactique</li>
<li>Améliore la circulation sanguine</li>
<li>Augmente le métabolisme</li>
<li>Favorise l'élimination des toxines</li>
<li>Augmente l'énergie corporelle</li>
<li>Améliore la mémoire</li>
<li>Réduit l'anxiété et le stress</li>
<li>Favorise un sommeil profond</li>
<li>Améliore le tonus de la peau</li>
<li>Favorise la perte de poids</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pourquoi un centre hyperbare pour chiens?</h3>
<p>Mon chien, Eldorado, est très malade et l’OHB peut aider à stabiliser sa condition et à l’améliorer également. Malheureusement, il n’existe actuellement aucun distributeur qui accepte de louer un caisson pour un animal. Au cours des 2 dernières années, j’ai côtoyé plusieurs spécialistes en médecine vétérinaire et en médecine alternative pour animaux qui m’ont confirmé que cette thérapie peut être bénéfique pour Eldorado ainsi qu'à un grand nombre d’animaux de compagnie et que je n’étais pas la seule à vouloir y avoir accès pour mon chien.</p>
<p>Le centre hyperbare canin fera partie d’un complexe canin déjà existant, le Studio Chez Helly. Il s’agit d'un centre d’entraînement et de santé canin axé sur le bien-être physique et mental du chien… et de son humain… Côté centre d’entraînement, le Studio offre des activités sportives qui aident le chien à se développer harmonieusement en plus de favoriser l’harmonie humain/chien. Côté centre de santé, le Studio organise déjà des séances de fitness canin avec du matériel spécialisé et il offre à la location en libre-service des matelas à champs électromagnétiques pulsés. La location de caissons hyperbares sera un bel ajout à l’offre existante.  </p>
<h3>Où sera situé le Centre hyperbare pour chiens?</h3>
<p>J'ai décidé d'implanter le Centre à Trois-Rivières afin de bénéficier d'un emplacement au centre du Québec. Cet espace accueillera le premier caisson qui servira pour les forfaits Découverte et Désensibiliser et pour la location à l'heure. Les autres caissons seront disponibles à la location à long terme et ils se promèneront partout au Québec... et même ailleurs!!! </p>
<h3>Qui suis-je</h3>
<p>J’ai 57 ans, je suis traductrice agréée et je partage ma vie avec mon conjoint Alain, mes deux chiens, Eldorado, 9 ans, Helly, 4 ans et mon cheval, Malcolm 18 ans. Je suis active dans le domaine canin depuis plus de 30 ans et j’apprends encore tous les jours…</p>
<p>Mais ce n’est pas suffisant pour me décrire…</p>
<p>Je suis une passionnée… par les arts, les lettres, les relations humaines, la nature et par les animaux… tous les animaux, mais surtout les chiens… Bien que chevaux, chiens, chats, hamsters et cie ont toujours fait partie de ma vie, ce n’est qu’en 1988 que j’ai adopté mon premier chien à moi, Léo, un berger belge tervueren. Léo a été un compagnon extraordinaire! Toujours partant pour jouer, courir, s’entraîner, etc. Avec Léo, j’ai découvert l’amour inconditionnel et la relation privilégiée qu’on peut avoir avec un chien. Mais je sais aujourd’hui que j’ai fait d’énormes erreurs, et ce, bien malgré moi, toutefois l’important est de les reconnaitre et de ne pas les répéter… Léo était un bel ambassadeur de sa race et j’ai développé une passion pour le berger belge et les sports canins tout en m’interrogeant sur les principes fondamentaux du comportement canin… Léo a partagé une bonne partie de sa vie avec Lennie que j’ai adoptée à l’âge de 3 ans! Lennie avait une telle joie de vivre malgré un début de vie extrêmement difficile. Elle était l’exemple même de la résilience! Par la suite, ma douce Folie! est venue se joindre à eux. Léo et Lennie ont pris à coeur son éducation et ils en ont fait une chienne quasi parfaite qui a développé des aptitudes extraordinaires de « chien urbain »… Malgré les bons soins de santé conventionnels que je lui ai offerts, Folie! a développé de graves problèmes de mobilité, ce qui a sonné une petite cloche et mis en doute mes « croyances » en matière de santé et d’alimentation. Après avoir perdu Léo et Lennie d’une même pathologie à quelques années d’intervalle, j’ai présenté à Folie! un nouveau compagnon… Eldorado… mon bel Eldorado… s’ils ont tous fait en sorte, chacun à leur manière, que je remette régulièrement en question mes connaissances, c’est Eldorado qui m’a donné le courage de passer à l’action, c’est lui qui m’a appris à suivre mon instinct. J’ai changé toutes mes habitudes en matière de santé, d’alimentation et d’éducation et surtout, j’ai reconsidéré la notion de respect qui est au centre de la relation. Eldorado est un être extrêmement sensible et j’ai avec lui une connexion spéciale que j’ai découverte notamment au cours de son éducation et de son entraînement sportif, mais plus particulièrement par le biais de sa maladie. Eldorado m’a appris à écouter… à l’écouter et à m’écouter… En fait, il m’a appris à vivre… mais ça, c’est une longue histoire que je vous raconterai plus tard... Et puis, il y a Helly!!! mon joyeux troubadour, mon soleil, mon petit bonheur… qui met tellement d’humour et… d’action dans ma vie!!! En fait, Eldorado est mon professeur, mon mentor et Helly… mon laboratoire, mais il ne s’en plaint pas du tout!!! </p>
<p>Grâce à eux, et je dis bien, GRÂCE à eux, j’ai mis de côté une carrière en traduction qui ne me correspondait plus pour me tourner vers ma passion, le comportement canin via les sports canins… un bel amalgame!!! Je suis des formations pour confirmer et compléter mes connaissances et je me sens comme un poisson dans l’eau… Mais il reste une ombre au tableau, la santé de mon bel Eldorado… C’est comme si je lui avais fait une promesse de faire tout ce qui est en mon pouvoir pour qu’il vive la vie qu’il mérite et de partager mes acquis pour que les autres chiens en profitent…</p>
<h3><strong>Ce dont j’ai besoin et ce que vous recevrez</strong></h3>
<p>Mon objectif est d’amasser 30 000$ pour acheter un caisson Oxynova de la série 9</p>
<h3>Pourquoi Oxynova? </h3>
<p>Pour la qualité supérieure du produit. Oxynova est le premier fabricant de caissons souples au Québec et j’ai confiance en son produit. J’ai besoin d’un produit qui a fait ses preuves puisque le caisson sera utilisé de façon intensive… Je rédigerai un article dans la FAQ pour expliquer plus en détail les points forts des caissons Oxynova.</p>
<p>Pourquoi un caisson de la Série 9? Parce qu’il est plus grand (282 cm x 92 cm) et qu’il possède plus de hublots (8). Il est tout indiqué pour les premières expériences, autant pour l’humain (surtout ceux qui, comme moi, souffrent de claustrophobie) que pour le chien.</p>
<h3>De quelle façon l’argent va-t-il être utilisé?</h3>
<p>Pour l’achat d’un caisson uniquement. J’ai déjà des collaborateurs prêts à aménager une pièce dans le Studio afin de créer un espace intime et accueillant pour les besoins de l’OHB. </p>
<h3>Qu’est-ce que je ferai avec les fonds amassés si je n’atteins pas mon objectif</h3>
<p>J’espère atteindre mon objectif rapidement, toutefois si je n’y arrive pas dans le délai que je me suis donné, je pourrai relancer la campagne et obtenir du crédit grâce à l’argent amassée. De toute façon, tout l'argent recueilli servira à l’achat d’un caisson hyperbare d’une façon ou d’une autre…</p>
<h3>Qu’est-ce que je ferai de l’argent si je dépasse mon objectif?</h3>
<p>Il sera investi dans le 2e volet de mon projet, soit l’achat d’un 2e caisson hyperbare qui servira aux locations à long terme pour les protocoles de 40 jours à la maison. </p>
<h3>De quelles façons vous pouvez contribuer?</h3>
<p>En achetant des forfaits en prévente.</p>
<p>En achetant des billets de tirage.</p>
<p>En achetant les produits et services de mes généreux collaborateurs.</p>
<p>Vous pouvez partager cette campagne dans votre réseau pour aider à la faire connaître.</p>
<p>Vous pouvez communiquer avec moi pour devenir un « généreux collaborateur »</p>
<h3>Ce que vous pouvez obtenir en contrepartie des contributions</h3>
<p>Pour m’aider à financer ce projet, j’offre des forfaits en prévente à prix vraiment avantageux. De plus, grâce à de généreux collaborateurs, je peux offrir des produits et services en lien avec les animaux et la santé.</p>
<p>Chaque dollar investi est important pour moi, il n’y a pas de petits montants, il n’y a que des dollars qui s’accumulent et qui me rapprochent de mon objectif. Je serai reconnaissante peu importe le montant versé, car il m’aidera à atteindre mes 2 buts : soigner mon bel Eldorado et permettre à d’autres personnes d’en faire autant pour « l’être vivant » qui partage leur vie.</p>
<p>Je ne vous demande pas de me donner de l’argent (quoique vous pouvez le faire si cela vous plaît et j'en serais ravie!!!) je vous demande d’investir dans mon projet, dans un projet de santé et de bien-être pour les chiens…Donc, si vous êtes prêt à investir, j’ai quelque chose pour vous.</p>
<h3>Risques et défis</h3>
<p>Je suis entourée par des vétérinaires spécialisés en neurologie, en orthopédie et en médecine sportive, par des ostéopathes et chiropraticiens spécialisés pour les animaux, etc. J’ai accumulé beaucoup d'information en discutant avec eux et en faisant des recherches. Ainsi, je me suis rendue compte que l’OHB peut vraiment faire la différence dans la vie d’un grand nombre de chiens… et de leurs humains et certains sont même prêts à référer le Centre. Plusieurs me confirment que l’OHB peut faire la différence dans la vie d’un grand nombre de chiens… et de leurs humains et ils sont prêts à référer le Centre. Par contre, je sais également que l’OHB n’est pas à la porter de tous les budgets. Ainsi, la location des caissons hyperbares ne sera pas nécessairement rentable à court terme et c’est grâce à votre soutien que je pourrai rapidement offrir ce service à ceux qui en ont un urgent besoin, sans avoir trop d’attentes en terme de rentabilité. De plus, le fait que le Centre hyperbare pour chiens fait partie d’un ensemble, il sera supporté par les autres activités du Studio. D’ailleurs, dès que la rentabilité sera au rendez-vous, je prévois créer un fonds afin d’offrir à des familles à faible revenu, sélectionnées selon certains critères, des forfaits gratuits.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>Give people opportunity to rent a portable hyperbaric chamber to help their dog to recover their health or to improve their condition thanks to low pressure hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HOT)</p>
<h3>What is low pressure HOT?</h3>
<p>Low pressure HOT consist in breathing oxygen at a pressure higher than atmospheric one. Oxygen under pressure penetrate more easily in body fluids and help to regenerate tissues and organs.</p>
<p>Pet, accompanied by a human, is installed in a 1.3 ATA, low pressured sealed chamber, equivalent to 4 meters diving. </p>
<h3>What are the benefits of low pressure HOT (1.3 ATA)?</h3>
<p>Many effects are recognized and documented. Low pressure HOT activates repair cells and cellular repair mechanisms. It stimulates cellular revascularization and promotes tissue and organ healing. It fights inflammation and help eliminate neurotoxic heavy metals. Scientific research has show the effectiveness of the low pressure HOT in treating chronic or acute neurological conditions </p>
<p>Here are some examples of conditions that could be improved with HOT:</p>
<ul>
<li>Epilepsy, because HOT increases glutathion peroxidase production and promote brain’s blood vessels oxygenation in addition to have an anti-inflammatory effect.</li>
<li>Lyme disease, because HOT increases the effectiveness of certain antibiotics.</li>
<li>Fractures, burns and others injuries, because HOT promotes faster healing.</li>
<li>Pre and post surgery, because HOT promotes vascularization.</li>
<li>Cancer, because cancer cells do not like oxygen.</li>
</ul>
<p>HOT also helps to reduce symptoms of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia (it reduces pain and inflammation) in humans.</p>
<h3>Other benefit of HOT: </h3>
<ul>
<li>Improves sport perform</li>
<li>Increases endurance</li>
<li>Helps to recover after intensive effort</li>
<li>Reduces lactic acid</li>
<li>Improves blood circulation</li>
<li>Increases the metabolism</li>
<li>Encourages toxin elimination</li>
<li>Increases body energy</li>
<li>Improves memory</li>
<li>Reduces anxiety and stress</li>
<li>Promotes deep sleep</li>
<li>Improves skin tone</li>
<li>Promotes weight loss</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why an hyperbaric centre for dogs?</h3>
<p>My dog, Eldorado is very sick and the HOT can help to stabilize his condition and also improve Unfortunately, there is no distributor currently that agrees to rent an hyperbaric chamber for a pet. In the last two years, I met many specialists in veterinary medicine and in alternative medicine for animals who confirmed that this therapy would be beneficial for Eldorado and to a lot of pets and I am not the only one who wants to access to this for my dog.</p>
<p>The canine hyperbaric centre will be part of an existing canine complex, Studio Chez Helly. This is a dog training and wellness centre that focuses on physical and mental bell-being for dog… and his human… On the training side, the Studio provides sporting activities that help dog to develop harmoniously in addition to promote human/dog harmony. On the wellness centre, the Studio organize already provides canine fitness with specialized material and offers for self service hour rental pulsed electromagnetic field mattress. The rental of hyperbaric chamber will be a welcomed addition to the existing offer.</p>
<h3>Where the Hyperbaric Center for Dogs will be located?</h3>
<p>I decided to locate the Center in Trois-Rivières in order to have a central place in Quebec. This space will host the fist chamber that will serve for Discover and Desensitize packages and for hourly rentals. Other chambers will be available for long term renting at home and it will travel everywhere in Quebec... and elsewhere!!! </p>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am 67 years old, I am a certified translator and I share my life with my partner Alain, my dogs, Eldorado 9 yo and Helly 4 yo and my horse Malcolm, 18 yo. I am active in the canine world since more than 30 years and I am still learning every day…</p>
<p>But, this is not enough to describe me…</p>
<p>I’m a passionate… of arts, letters, human relations, nature and animals… all the animals, but mostly by dogs… Although, horses, dogs, cats, hamster and others have always been part of my life, it is only in 1988 that I have adopted my first own dog, Léo, a Belgian shepherd Tervuren. Léo has been an extraordinary companion! Always willing for play, run, training, etc. With Léo, I discovered unconditional love and a privileged relationship that we can have with a dog. But, I know now that I made huge mistakes, however unintentionally, but the more important is to recognize them and try to not repeat them… Léo was a great ambassador of his breed and I developed a passion for the Belgian shepherd and dog sports while I wonder about core principles of dog behaviour… Léo has shared a part of his life with Lennie who I adopted at 3 years old. Lennie had such a joy of life despite an extremely difficult start in life. She was the true example of resilience! Thereafter, my sweet Folie! came to join them. Léo and Lennie have taken to heart her education and they have made an almost perfect dog who had developed extraordinary skills to be « urban dog »… Despite good conventional health care, Folie! had developed severe mobility issues, which rang a bell for me and questioning my « beliefs » about health and nutrition. After lose Léo and Lennie from the same pathology with a few years intervals, I introduced to Folie! a new companion… Eldorado… my beautiful Eldorado… If they all made me question, each in its own way, my knowledge, this is Eldorado who give me courage to act, this is him who taught me to follow my instinct. I changed all my health, feeding and education habits and, above all, I revisited the concept of respect that is at the heart of the relationship. Eldorado is an extremely sensitive being and I have a special link with him that I discovered during his education and sport training, but more particularly, through his illness. Eldorado taught me to listen… listen to him and listen to me… Actually, he taught me to live… but that, it is a long story that I will share later… And then, there is Helly!!! my happy buddy, my sun, my happiness… who adds so much humour and… action in my life!!! In fact, Eldorado is my teacher, my mentor and Helly… my laboratory, but he does not complain at all!!!</p>
<p>Thanks to them, and I reiterate, THANKS to them, I left out a career in translation that no longer suited me to turn me toward my passion, canine behaviour through dog sports… a nice combination!!! I follow training programs to confirm and complete my knowledges and I feel like a fish in water… But there remains one cloud on the horizon, my beautiful Eldorado’s health… It is like I made him a promise to do everything in my power to give him the life he deserves and to share my knowledge with others to the benefits of dogs…</p>
<h3>What I need and what you get</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $30 000 to buy an Oxynova series 9 hyperbaric chamber</p>
<h3>Why Oxynova? </h3>
<p>For the superior quality of the product. Oxynova is the first flexible hyperbaric chamber manufacturer in Quebec and I trust their products. I need a product that has proven its worth, because the chamber will be use intensively… I will write an article in the FAQ to more fully explain particular strengths of the Oxynova hyperbaric chambers.</p>
<p>Why Series 9? Because it is the largest (282 cm x 92 cm) and it has more portholes (8). It is particularly well suited for first experiences, for both, human (for those that, like me, suffer from claustrophobia) and dog.</p>
<h3>How the money will be use?</h3>
<p>To buy the hyperbaric chamber only. I already have people ready to convert one room in the Studio to create an intimate and welcoming space for HOT needs.</p>
<h3>What is my backup plan?</h3>
<p>I hope to reach my goal quickly, however if I cannot reach it within the deadline, I will continue to raise money and get credit tanks to money already collected. Anyway, all money raised will be used to buy the hyperbaric chamber in one way or another…</p>
<h3>What I am going to do if I surpass my goal?</h3>
<p>Money will be spent for the 2nd phase of my project, the purchase of the 2nd hyperbaric chamber that will be use for long-term rents for the 40 days protocols at home.</p>
<h3>How you can contribute?</h3>
<ul>
<li>By purchasing pre-sale packages.</li>
<li>By purchasing drawing tickets.</li>
<li>By purchasing products and services from my generous collaborators.</li>
<li>You may share this campaign in your network to help spread the word.</li>
<li>You can contact me to become a « generous collaborator »</li>
</ul>
<h3>What you can get in exchange for your contribution.</h3>
<p>To help me finance this project, I offer pre-sale packages at very advantageous prices. Also, thanks to generous collaborators, I can offer products and services in link with animals and health.</p>
<p>Each dollar invested is important for me, there is no little amount, there is just dollars that accumulate and that bring me closer to my goal. I will be grateful no matter the amount, because it will help me to reach my 2 goals : heal my beautiful Eldorado and allow other persons to do the same for their « living being » that shares their life.</p>
<p>I do not ask you to give me money (although you can make it if you want and I would be grateful), I ask you to invest in my project, in a health and wellness project for dogs… So, if you are ready to invest, I have something for you.</p>
<h3>Risks and challenges </h3>
<p>I am surrounded by neurologic, orthopedic and sports medicine specialists veterinarians. I accumulated a lot of information by discussing with them and by doing research. Thus, I realized that HOT can make the difference in the life of many dog… and their humans and certain are ready to refer the Centre. However, I also know that this is not everyone that can afford it. The rental will not necessarily cost-effective in the short term and it is thanks to your support that I will be able to offer rapidly this service for those who are in urgent need, without too many expectations in terms of profitability. Furthermore, the fact that the hyperbaric centre for dogs is part of an existing centre, it will be support by the others activities of the Studio.

J’ai perdu une partie de mon âme. Mon bel Eldorado, mon amour, ma muse est parti.
Eldo était à l’origine du projet,  j’ai besoin de prendre un peu de recul… Je tiens toujours au projet d’un centre d’oxygénothérapie pour chiens, car d’autres chiens en auront besoin un jour… mais je me sens moins dans l’urgence, c’est pourquoi j’ai décidé d'annuler la campagne de financement et de rembourser tous les contributeurs.

I lost a part of my soul. My beautiful Eldorado, my love, my muse is gone.
Eldo was at the origine of the project, I need to take a step back for a while… I still want this canine hyperbaric center, because other dogs will need it in the future… but, I feel less urged, that is why I decided to cancel the crowdfunding and reimburse all contributors.

 
*** English follows *** 
(please be indulgent for the English version, it is not my first language) 
Objectif
Offrir aux gens la possibilité de louer un caisson hyperbare portable pour aider leur chien à recouvrer la santé ou à améliorer leur condition grâce à l’oxygénothérapie hyperbare (OHB) à basse pression. 
Qu’est-ce que l’oxygénothérapie hyperbare à basse pression?
L’oxygénothérapie hyperbare à basse pression consiste à faire respirer de l’oxygène à une pression supérieure à la pression atmosphérique. L’oxygène sous pression pénètre plus facilement dans les liquides du corps et aide à régénérer les cellules de tous les tissus et organes.
L’animal, accompagné d’un humain, est installé dans un caisson étanche faiblement pressurisé à 1,3 ATA, ce qui équivaut à une plongée sous-marine à 4 mètres de profondeur. 
Quels sont les avantages de l’oxygénothérapie hyperbare à basse pression (1,3 ATA)?
De nombreux effets bénéfiques sont reconnus et documentés. L’OHB à basse pression active les cellules réparatrices ainsi que les mécanismes de réparation cellulaire. Elle stimule la revascularisation cellulaire et la cicatrisation des tissus et organes. Elle combat l’inflammation et favorise l’élimination des métaux lourds neurotoxiques. Des recherches scientifiques ont également démontré l’efficacité de l’OHB à basse pression dans le traitement de conditions neurologiques chroniques ou aiguës.
Voici quelques exemples de conditions qui peuvent être améliorées avec l’OHB :

Épilepsie, car l’OHB augmente la production de glutathion peroxydase et favorise l’oxygénation des vaisseaux sanguins du cerveau en plus d'avoir un effet anti-inflammatoire.
Maladie de Lyme, car l’OHB augmente l’efficacité de certains antibiotiques.
Fractures, brûlures et autres blessures, car l’OHB favorise une guérison plus rapide.
Pré et post opératoire, car l’OHB favorise la vascularisation.
Cancer, car les cellules cancéreuses n’aiment pas l’oxygène.

L’OHB aide également à diminuer les symptômes de la fatigue chronique et de la fibromyalgie (réduit la douleur et l’inflammation) chez l’humain.
Autres avantages de l’OHB :

Améliore les performances sportives
Augmente l'endurance
Aide à récupérer après un effort intense
Réduit l'acide lactique
Améliore la circulation sanguine
Augmente le métabolisme
Favorise l'élimination des toxines
Augmente l'énergie corporelle
Améliore la mémoire
Réduit l'anxiété et le stress
Favorise un sommeil profond
Améliore le tonus de la peau
Favorise la perte de poids

Pourquoi un centre hyperbare pour chiens?
Mon chien, Eldorado, est très malade et l’OHB peut aider à stabiliser sa condition et à l’améliorer également. Malheureusement, il n’existe actuellement aucun distributeur qui accepte de louer un caisson pour un animal. Au cours des 2 dernières années, j’ai côtoyé plusieurs spécialistes en médecine vétérinaire et en médecine alternative pour animaux qui m’ont confirmé que cette thérapie peut être bénéfique pour Eldorado ainsi qu'à un grand nombre d’animaux de compagnie et que je n’étais pas la seule à vouloir y avoir accès pour mon chien.
Le centre hyperbare canin fera partie d’un complexe canin déjà existant, le Studio Chez Helly. Il s’agit d'un centre d’entraînement et de santé canin axé sur le bien-être physique et mental du chien… et de son humain… Côté centre d’entraînement, le Studio offre des activités sportives qui aident le chien à se développer harmonieusement en plus de favoriser l’harmonie humain/chien. Côté centre de santé, le Studio organise déjà des séances de fitness canin avec du matériel spécialisé et il offre à la location en libre-service des matelas à champs électromagnétiques pulsés. La location de caissons hyperbares sera un bel ajout à l’offre existante.  
Où sera situé le Centre hyperbare pour chiens?
J'ai décidé d'implanter le Centre à Trois-Rivières afin de bénéficier d'un emplacement au centre du Québec. Cet espace accueillera le premier caisson qui servira pour les forfaits Découverte et Désensibiliser et pour la location à l'heure. Les autres caissons seront disponibles à la location à long terme et ils se promèneront partout au Québec... et même ailleurs!!! 
Qui suis-je
J’ai 57 ans, je suis traductrice agréée et je partage ma vie avec mon conjoint Alain, mes deux chiens, Eldorado, 9 ans, Helly, 4 ans et mon cheval, Malcolm 18 ans. Je suis active dans le domaine canin depuis plus de 30 ans et j’apprends encore tous les jours…
Mais ce n’est pas suffisant pour me décrire…
Je suis une passionnée… par les arts, les lettres, les relations humaines, la nature et par les animaux… tous les animaux, mais surtout les chiens… Bien que chevaux, chiens, chats, hamsters et cie ont toujours fait partie de ma vie, ce n’est qu’en 1988 que j’ai adopté mon premier chien à moi, Léo, un berger belge tervueren. Léo a été un compagnon extraordinaire! Toujours partant pour jouer, courir, s’entraîner, etc. Avec Léo, j’ai découvert l’amour inconditionnel et la relation privilégiée qu’on peut avoir avec un chien. Mais je sais aujourd’hui que j’ai fait d’énormes erreurs, et ce, bien malgré moi, toutefois l’important est de les reconnaitre et de ne pas les répéter… Léo était un bel ambassadeur de sa race et j’ai développé une passion pour le berger belge et les sports canins tout en m’interrogeant sur les principes fondamentaux du comportement canin… Léo a partagé une bonne partie de sa vie avec Lennie que j’ai adoptée à l’âge de 3 ans! Lennie avait une telle joie de vivre malgré un début de vie extrêmement difficile. Elle était l’exemple même de la résilience! Par la suite, ma douce Folie! est venue se joindre à eux. Léo et Lennie ont pris à coeur son éducation et ils en ont fait une chienne quasi parfaite qui a développé des aptitudes extraordinaires de « chien urbain »… Malgré les bons soins de santé conventionnels que je lui ai offerts, Folie! a développé de graves problèmes de mobilité, ce qui a sonné une petite cloche et mis en doute mes « croyances » en matière de santé et d’alimentation. Après avoir perdu Léo et Lennie d’une même pathologie à quelques années d’intervalle, j’ai présenté à Folie! un nouveau compagnon… Eldorado… mon bel Eldorado… s’ils ont tous fait en sorte, chacun à leur manière, que je remette régulièrement en question mes connaissances, c’est Eldorado qui m’a donné le courage de passer à l’action, c’est lui qui m’a appris à suivre mon instinct. J’ai changé toutes mes habitudes en matière de santé, d’alimentation et d’éducation et surtout, j’ai reconsidéré la notion de respect qui est au centre de la relation. Eldorado est un être extrêmement sensible et j’ai avec lui une connexion spéciale que j’ai découverte notamment au cours de son éducation et de son entraînement sportif, mais plus particulièrement par le biais de sa maladie. Eldorado m’a appris à écouter… à l’écouter et à m’écouter… En fait, il m’a appris à vivre… mais ça, c’est une longue histoire que je vous raconterai plus tard... Et puis, il y a Helly!!! mon joyeux troubadour, mon soleil, mon petit bonheur… qui met tellement d’humour et… d’action dans ma vie!!! En fait, Eldorado est mon professeur, mon mentor et Helly… mon laboratoire, mais il ne s’en plaint pas du tout!!! 
Grâce à eux, et je dis bien, GRÂCE à eux, j’ai mis de côté une carrière en traduction qui ne me correspondait plus pour me tourner vers ma passion, le comportement canin via les sports canins… un bel amalgame!!! Je suis des formations pour confirmer et compléter mes connaissances et je me sens comme un poisson dans l’eau… Mais il reste une ombre au tableau, la santé de mon bel Eldorado… C’est comme si je lui avais fait une promesse de faire tout ce qui est en mon pouvoir pour qu’il vive la vie qu’il mérite et de partager mes acquis pour que les autres chiens en profitent…
Ce dont j’ai besoin et ce que vous recevrez
Mon objectif est d’amasser 30 000$ pour acheter un caisson Oxynova de la série 9
Pourquoi Oxynova? 
Pour la qualité supérieure du produit. Oxynova est le premier fabricant de caissons souples au Québec et j’ai confiance en son produit. J’ai besoin d’un produit qui a fait ses preuves puisque le caisson sera utilisé de façon intensive… Je rédigerai un article dans la FAQ pour expliquer plus en détail les points forts des caissons Oxynova.
Pourquoi un caisson de la Série 9? Parce qu’il est plus grand (282 cm x 92 cm) et qu’il possède plus de hublots (8). Il est tout indiqué pour les premières expériences, autant pour l’humain (surtout ceux qui, comme moi, souffrent de claustrophobie) que pour le chien.
De quelle façon l’argent va-t-il être utilisé?
Pour l’achat d’un caisson uniquement. J’ai déjà des collaborateurs prêts à aménager une pièce dans le Studio afin de créer un espace intime et accueillant pour les besoins de l’OHB. 
Qu’est-ce que je ferai avec les fonds amassés si je n’atteins pas mon objectif
J’espère atteindre mon objectif rapidement, toutefois si je n’y arrive pas dans le délai que je me suis donné, je pourrai relancer la campagne et obtenir du crédit grâce à l’argent amassée. De toute façon, tout l'argent recueilli servira à l’achat d’un caisson hyperbare d’une façon ou d’une autre…
Qu’est-ce que je ferai de l’argent si je dépasse mon objectif?
Il sera investi dans le 2e volet de mon projet, soit l’achat d’un 2e caisson hyperbare qui servira aux locations à long terme pour les protocoles de 40 jours à la maison. 
De quelles façons vous pouvez contribuer?
En achetant des forfaits en prévente.
En achetant des billets de tirage.
En achetant les produits et services de mes généreux collaborateurs.
Vous pouvez partager cette campagne dans votre réseau pour aider à la faire connaître.
Vous pouvez communiquer avec moi pour devenir un « généreux collaborateur »
Ce que vous pouvez obtenir en contrepartie des contributions
Pour m’aider à financer ce projet, j’offre des forfaits en prévente à prix vraiment avantageux. De plus, grâce à de généreux collaborateurs, je peux offrir des produits et services en lien avec les animaux et la santé.
Chaque dollar investi est important pour moi, il n’y a pas de petits montants, il n’y a que des dollars qui s’accumulent et qui me rapprochent de mon objectif. Je serai reconnaissante peu importe le montant versé, car il m’aidera à atteindre mes 2 buts : soigner mon bel Eldorado et permettre à d’autres personnes d’en faire autant pour « l’être vivant » qui partage leur vie.
Je ne vous demande pas de me donner de l’argent (quoique vous pouvez le faire si cela vous plaît et j'en serais ravie!!!) je vous demande d’investir dans mon projet, dans un projet de santé et de bien-être pour les chiens…Donc, si vous êtes prêt à investir, j’ai quelque chose pour vous.
Risques et défis
Je suis entourée par des vétérinaires spécialisés en neurologie, en orthopédie et en médecine sportive, par des ostéopathes et chiropraticiens spécialisés pour les animaux, etc. J’ai accumulé beaucoup d'information en discutant avec eux et en faisant des recherches. Ainsi, je me suis rendue compte que l’OHB peut vraiment faire la différence dans la vie d’un grand nombre de chiens… et de leurs humains et certains sont même prêts à référer le Centre. Plusieurs me confirment que l’OHB peut faire la différence dans la vie d’un grand nombre de chiens… et de leurs humains et ils sont prêts à référer le Centre. Par contre, je sais également que l’OHB n’est pas à la porter de tous les budgets. Ainsi, la location des caissons hyperbares ne sera pas nécessairement rentable à court terme et c’est grâce à votre soutien que je pourrai rapidement offrir ce service à ceux qui en ont un urgent besoin, sans avoir trop d’attentes en terme de rentabilité. De plus, le fait que le Centre hyperbare pour chiens fait partie d’un ensemble, il sera supporté par les autres activités du Studio. D’ailleurs, dès que la rentabilité sera au rendez-vous, je prévois créer un fonds afin d’offrir à des familles à faible revenu, sélectionnées selon certains critères, des forfaits gratuits.

Goal
Give people opportunity to rent a portable hyperbaric chamber to help their dog to recover their health or to improve their condition thanks to low pressure hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HOT)
What is low pressure HOT?
Low pressure HOT consist in breathing oxygen at a pressure higher than atmospheric one. Oxygen under pressure penetrate more easily in body fluids and help to regenerate tissues and organs.
Pet, accompanied by a human, is installed in a 1.3 ATA, low pressured sealed chamber, equivalent to 4 meters diving. 
What are the benefits of low pressure HOT (1.3 ATA)?
Many effects are recognized and documented. Low pressure HOT activates repair cells and cellular repair mechanisms. It stimulates cellular revascularization and promotes tissue and organ healing. It fights inflammation and help eliminate neurotoxic heavy metals. Scientific research has show the effectiveness of the low pressure HOT in treating chronic or acute neurological conditions 
Here are some examples of conditions that could be improved with HOT:

Epilepsy, because HOT increases glutathion peroxidase production and promote brain’s blood vessels oxygenation in addition to have an anti-inflammatory effect.
Lyme disease, because HOT increases the effectiveness of certain antibiotics.
Fractures, burns and others injuries, because HOT promotes faster healing.
Pre and post surgery, because HOT promotes vascularization.
Cancer, because cancer cells do not like oxygen.

HOT also helps to reduce symptoms of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia (it reduces pain and inflammation) in humans.
Other benefit of HOT: 

Improves sport perform
Increases endurance
Helps to recover after intensive effort
Reduces lactic acid
Improves blood circulation
Increases the metabolism
Encourages toxin elimination
Increases body energy
Improves memory
Reduces anxiety and stress
Promotes deep sleep
Improves skin tone
Promotes weight loss

Why an hyperbaric centre for dogs?
My dog, Eldorado is very sick and the HOT can help to stabilize his condition and also improve Unfortunately, there is no distributor currently that agrees to rent an hyperbaric chamber for a pet. In the last two years, I met many specialists in veterinary medicine and in alternative medicine for animals who confirmed that this therapy would be beneficial for Eldorado and to a lot of pets and I am not the only one who wants to access to this for my dog.
The canine hyperbaric centre will be part of an existing canine complex, Studio Chez Helly. This is a dog training and wellness centre that focuses on physical and mental bell-being for dog… and his human… On the training side, the Studio provides sporting activities that help dog to develop harmoniously in addition to promote human/dog harmony. On the wellness centre, the Studio organize already provides canine fitness with specialized material and offers for self service hour rental pulsed electromagnetic field mattress. The rental of hyperbaric chamber will be a welcomed addition to the existing offer.
Where the Hyperbaric Center for Dogs will be located?
I decided to locate the Center in Trois-Rivières in order to have a central place in Quebec. This space will host the fist chamber that will serve for Discover and Desensitize packages and for hourly rentals. Other chambers will be available for long term renting at home and it will travel everywhere in Quebec... and elsewhere!!! 
Who am I?
I am 67 years old, I am a certified translator and I share my life with my partner Alain, my dogs, Eldorado 9 yo and Helly 4 yo and my horse Malcolm, 18 yo. I am active in the canine world since more than 30 years and I am still learning every day…
But, this is not enough to describe me…
I’m a passionate… of arts, letters, human relations, nature and animals… all the animals, but mostly by dogs… Although, horses, dogs, cats, hamster and others have always been part of my life, it is only in 1988 that I have adopted my first own dog, Léo, a Belgian shepherd Tervuren. Léo has been an extraordinary companion! Always willing for play, run, training, etc. With Léo, I discovered unconditional love and a privileged relationship that we can have with a dog. But, I know now that I made huge mistakes, however unintentionally, but the more important is to recognize them and try to not repeat them… Léo was a great ambassador of his breed and I developed a passion for the Belgian shepherd and dog sports while I wonder about core principles of dog behaviour… Léo has shared a part of his life with Lennie who I adopted at 3 years old. Lennie had such a joy of life despite an extremely difficult start in life. She was the true example of resilience! Thereafter, my sweet Folie! came to join them. Léo and Lennie have taken to heart her education and they have made an almost perfect dog who had developed extraordinary skills to be « urban dog »… Despite good conventional health care, Folie! had developed severe mobility issues, which rang a bell for me and questioning my « beliefs » about health and nutrition. After lose Léo and Lennie from the same pathology with a few years intervals, I introduced to Folie! a new companion… Eldorado… my beautiful Eldorado… If they all made me question, each in its own way, my knowledge, this is Eldorado who give me courage to act, this is him who taught me to follow my instinct. I changed all my health, feeding and education habits and, above all, I revisited the concept of respect that is at the heart of the relationship. Eldorado is an extremely sensitive being and I have a special link with him that I discovered during his education and sport training, but more particularly, through his illness. Eldorado taught me to listen… listen to him and listen to me… Actually, he taught me to live… but that, it is a long story that I will share later… And then, there is Helly!!! my happy buddy, my sun, my happiness… who adds so much humour and… action in my life!!! In fact, Eldorado is my teacher, my mentor and Helly… my laboratory, but he does not complain at all!!!
Thanks to them, and I reiterate, THANKS to them, I left out a career in translation that no longer suited me to turn me toward my passion, canine behaviour through dog sports… a nice combination!!! I follow training programs to confirm and complete my knowledges and I feel like a fish in water… But there remains one cloud on the horizon, my beautiful Eldorado’s health… It is like I made him a promise to do everything in my power to give him the life he deserves and to share my knowledge with others to the benefits of dogs…

The house is for sale though, so that means tht someone could buy it as an investment and keep us as the tenants, or someone could buy it, have us leave, and live here for themselves...

<p> </p>
<p>What we are looking for, is enough money for a deposit. We can pay off a mortgage, we just need that little boost to allow us to get it. We were told that unless we had at least $10,000, there probably isnt much of a chance of us getting the house. Recently we have had to purchase a new (secondhand) car, as my old car died.

<p><strong>Nuestra historia</strong></p>
<p>Somos el grupo de atletas que irá a representar a Panamá en el campeonato mundial del ISKA - International Sport Karate and Kickboxing Association, en la disciplina de muay thai. Esta competencia se realizará en Kiev, Ucrania, del 2 al 8 de junio 2018, y salimos de viaje desde el 27 de mayo para aclimatarnos. Vamos con el fin de demostrar que la Selección Nacional de Muay thai de Panamá se perfila a nivel mundial, lo cual fue demostrado en ediciones anteriores con 3 campeones del mundo, y un campeón panamericano.</p>
<p>Fundado en 1986, el ISKA es considerado como autoridad reguladora en las artes marciales y deportes de combate, promoviendo atletas y escuelas de renombre en sus varias modalidades. Ha alcanzado su estatus internacional a través de su compromiso al deporte, credibilidad e integridad.</p>
<p>Nuestra academia es <strong><i>Panamá Muay Thai Academy</i></strong>, situada en panamá viejo justo en frente a la estatua de Morelos.  Nuestro equipo de competición tiene integrantes profesionales, trabajadores, estudiantes y de todas las edades. Las clases son mixtas, competidores con iniciados y profesionales con entusiastas como una gran familia deportista.</p>
<p><strong>Porqué es importante para nosotros</strong></p>
<p>Celebramos el desafío por medio de la competición sana, desarrollamos la superación personal en equipo, y honramos la amistad estrechada por los lazos de un objetivo común. Somos apasionados por nuestro deporte y compartimos, diariamente, los ritmos de la disciplina y entrega constantes de ser atleta y trabajador, atleta y estudiante o atleta y padre de familia.</p>
<p>Queremos ser ejemplo para futuros atletas, ayudando a impulsar un Panamá más sano. Nuestras aventuras y crecimiento en competencias nacionales e internacionales son historias de superación y amistad, y deseamos compartirlo con todos, dejando el camino para que más atletas puedan proyectarse y aprender.</p>
<p><strong>Nuestro objetivo</strong></p>
<p>Queremos dejar nuevamente a Panamá en el pódium mundial de la modalidad que disfrutamos y que nos mueve, une y emociona – el muay thai.</p>
<p>Tenemos el reconocimiento gubernamental de Pandeportes, quienes nos respaldan formalmente como asociación prestigiada, sin embargo, los gastos sufragados están siendo complementados por cada uno de los atletas. A pesar de los esfuerzos de cada uno, nos vemos en la necesidad de solicitar apoyo ya que no hemos alcanzado la cifra necesaria para lograr este proyecto.</p>
<p>El apoyo económico brindado será para solventar los costos de alojamiento, inscripciones y transporte de los atletas durante el viaje. Esto se refleja en pasajes aéreos, conexiones, boletines e documentación de registro en el evento organizado por el ISKA, aparte de un lugar donde dormir, comer y entrenar durante el tiempo que estaremos compitiendo.</p>
<p><strong>Un poco más a fondo – viajar &amp; competir</strong></p>
<p>Cada viaje en equipo es una prueba colectiva de hermandad, resistencia y apoyo. Salir en representación de nuestra bandera, es, además de traerla en el corazón, toda una rutina de enfoque y sacrifico. Como los demás deportes de combate, competimos en categorías de peso por lo que debemos mantenernos en nuestros escalones corriendo y entrenando diariamente, descansando y alimentándonos saludablemente. Al subirnos al ringue, el <i>peso</i> del equipo y la sinergia que se amplifica durante el viaje nos une y fortalece más. Esa complicidad nos da la confianza de avanzar y conquistar cada victoria.</p>
<p>Junto con Panamá Muay Thai Academy y la Asociación de Kickboxing Profesional de Panamá, pretendemos ser buen ejemplo e inspiración para quienes tengan el sueño de pelear por Panamá.  </p>

<h3>Visits for John and his Community</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585189564/q5qsacld1kppb8hmxkg4.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>John and I met over a year ago in a senior care community. As a software engineer, I was connected with John to help him learn how to use a tablet that he received as a gift. What began as lessons to use his new tablet continued into a genuine friendship. We bonded over our shared interest in technology, and built a relationship over countless conversations and football games every Saturday and Sunday afternoon. Since meeting John I have not missed visiting him on holidays or attending his special events. </p>
<p>Not only has my visits with John halted, visits with his sister were stopped as well as the result of COVID-19.

<h3>Helping others with limited technology resources</h3>
<p>Frustrated with the effects of the COVID-19 and knowing the connection between social interaction and health, I knew that there could be a way to combat social isolation with the use of technology.

<p>After seeing the impact that being able to connect with family had on John and other residents, I thought of other communities that are currently experiencing visitation bans. It became my mission to help connect others in senior care communities in the Atlanta area as well. </p>
<p>This is why the See You Soon Foundation exists. The foundation’s mission is to collaborate with families, healthcare professionals, and members of the community to maintain social connectedness within senior living communities.</p>

<p>Your contribution will help provide unique technology that will connect loved ones in senior care communities to family and friends. This technology includes an iPad, a stand to assist individuals with limited mobility, and access to the software I designed specifically for senior care communities. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>There were many hurdles that I had to overcome to ensure that I was successful at achieving this goal. One of the biggest obstacles was creating a system that is user friendly and not time consuming for senior care community staff. As a software engineer, I took this and many other factors into considerations when building the app.</p>
<p>With healthcare having its own set of tasks, I wanted to make certain that there was no disruption to the normal routines of the community healthcare workers. To address this, I created a user-friendly app that allows a seamless visit from family members being able to schedule a visit to healthcare staff connecting the call.</p>
<p>I have already invested both time and funds into making this unique technology available to a senior care community. I have addressed issues that were not initially visible and added additional features that I identified as enhancements. </p>
<p>Since this unique technology is beyond the prototype stage, I am able to provide it with confidence to other senior care communities. As more senior care communities are added, I will share updates along the way.</p>

</div></div>","Visits for John and his Community

John and I met over a year ago in a senior care community. As a software engineer, I was connected with John to help him learn how to use a tablet that he received as a gift. What began as lessons to use his new tablet continued into a genuine friendship. We bonded over our shared interest in technology, and built a relationship over countless conversations and football games every Saturday and Sunday afternoon. Since meeting John I have not missed visiting him on holidays or attending his special events. 
Not only has my visits with John halted, visits with his sister were stopped as well as the result of COVID-19. With the recent need to restrict visitation and existing high risks for loneliness in senior care communities, a solution to continue social interactions in senior care communities was my top priority.

<p>Hey everybody,</p>
<p>I have waited a while to talk about this because I wasn't sure it was going to happen. The approval came through. I am getting a new wheelchair. That is very awesome. However I do want to vent for a minute. I'm not sure if you are all aware but a new power wheelchair is right around 50 grand. Here's where things get a little tricky. Medicare will cover most of the chair. In fact nowadays they will even give you the ability to turn your wheelchair into a freaking La-Z-Boy. I will be able to drive around with my feet up. That's cool I'm not sure i will actually use it but maybe I will. The one piece of the chair that I use the most puts me at the level of a countertop or raises me up so I am at a level with most humans. Seems like a no brainer right however Medicare will not pay for that functionality they don't feel it is necessary for independence. I know that most of you take for granted that you were at I level with everybody else but when you sit in a chair you're always having to look up at people. The elevation feature is a $1850 out-of-pocket expense. There may be some people out there that will say will just deal with it. I'll tell you what why don't you sit in a chair next to your coffee pot and try to put water in it without standing up.</p>
</div><div><h3>OK everybody this is super hard for me. If you are willing to donate I would appreciate it. The total I have to cover is 1,850.</h3></div></div>","Hey everybody,
