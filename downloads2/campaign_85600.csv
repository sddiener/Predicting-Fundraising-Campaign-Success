<p><b>This album brings together an eclectic group of musicians</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> with styles ranging from folk to pop to
bluegrass. Some musicians are seasoned, widely acclaimed artists, while
others are accomplished artists in an earlier stage of their musical
careers. The CD features original songs
performed by both solo artists and groups, as well as two instrumental tunes.</span></p>
<p><b>The songs in this compilation, while diverse, all celebrate the watershed as a place of connection.</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Some convey the movement and energy of a stream in
the music itself, while others address the impacts of human activity and
development on our valuable and often threatened waterways. Some
compositions range into the realm of memory, testifying to the special place
that creeks and rivers can hold in our lives, as places of work, play, and spiritual replenishment. Finally, some
artists sing about water as a metaphor for important life
experiences. They all affirm the centrality of water in our lives, and the urgency of protecting healthy
and vital watersheds. </span></p>
<p><b>For those who love and care
about nature</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">, we hope this musical celebration of water will inspire you in
your stewardship. </span><b>For those who love music but may not know much about
watersheds</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">, we hope these songs will stir greater awareness. </span><b>For those who simply appreciate good music</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">, we believe the
superb songwriting and musicianship on this album will delight you! </span></p>
<p>We titled this album <i><b>Watershed: Music Inspired by the Place that Connects Us</b></i>
in the hope that the songs on this album speak to a network that
nourishes both our social “ecology” and the watersheds that sustain us,
wherever we live. With climate change and the very real changes it is bringing
to our global ecosystem, strong, vital and caring human communities that model
the very principles of watersheds offer our best hope for the future.  </p>

<h3>*What is a watershed?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">A watershed is not a
shed that stores water, but an area of land that “catches” water, or a
“catchment.” It is defined by topography—the shape of the land—rather than by
political boundaries or property lines. Water flows from higher parts of the
landscape, such as ridges, towards lower areas, such as valleys or ravines.
Runoff often forms a river or creek that makes its way toward a lake, bay or
ocean.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">A watershed is a place
where all beings are connected through the life-giving flow of water. As water
moves over and through the landscape, it carries soil and rock to form new
habitats, brings sustenance to plants, and gives nourishment to wildlife and
human communities. Fish like salmon and steelhead make their way from the sea
back to creeks and rivers as they complete their life cycles, bringing the
nutrients of the open ocean back to the watersheds of their birth. </i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Just as creeks can be

<h3></h3>When they released their debut EP, Brotherhood, in May 2012, their message was clear as were their influences- Killswitch Engage, Demon Hunter and Bullet for My Valentine, just to name a few.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>From These Ruins are ready to take it to the world. We have a magnitude of new material written and ready to record for our first full-length album and we want to do it the right way. Do-it-yourself is great, but there's something special about working with a producer and a professional studio. The problem is this- that gets expensive and in today's world that's just hard to afford. </p>
<p>We also want to tour the country but when all you have is a small SUV and no trailer, that can be a pain sometimes. This is what it comes down to- we need your help to finish up our full-length record and we really need a van and/or trailer for our gear and equipment. </p>
<p>By helping us out on this campaign you are helping make our dream a reality. The closer we get to our goal, the closer you get to making From These Ruins the next big thing. We don't let any good deed go unnoticed, either. By helping us, you'll become part of the FTR family for life and an honorary member of The Brotherhood. We will continue to thank you at every possible moment and who know what the possibilities are.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Young bands like us just don't have the funding to do everything we would like to do or the things we need to do- the necessities to make it to the next level. Everyone who sees us live is automatically hooked. The stories we've heard from people who have connected with our lyrics, our testimonies and our lives are priceless and unforgettable. We want to hear your stories and connect with you too and we want to meet all of you. We can't do that without touring properly and without the right things in place. We need a full-length album and a van and trailer (if possible). If you help us meet our goal, we guarantee that we will come to your city in the future. </p>
<p>Everyone loves good music. In today's music industry there's no shortage of bad music, bad rock and bad metal. The ""role models"" of today are, let's face it, people you don't want your kids looking up to. We need good people for our kids to look up to and we, along with the other bands we've formed relationships with are here to put a stop to it and take the morals and positivity of our country back.</p>

Since 2012, we have released 3 singles (""A Better World (ft. Traci Hines)"", ""Drowning Beautiful"", and ""Stay With Me""), but we need YOUR help so that we can record four more songs in the studio and create a full EP! Because we are unsigned and 100% independent, we need the support of our fans to help fund this EP and open up doors for us that will take us to the next level! With already nearly a quarter million hits on our YouTube channel, we hope to keep increasing momentum from here and create high end and exciting content for our fans!We put 100% into everything we do, and we won't settle for less. Because we want to produce high quality content for our fans, we need extra funding to do it right!We will return to the studio with producer Erik Ron (producer of ""Stay With Me"") to finish recording a full EP to be released this Summer! What We Need & What You GetSo here's what it breaks down to:
The bulk of this funding will go directly to the production cost of recording the new songs. 
We will also use the funding to press physical CDs of our EP.
Donators will get awesome perks and prizes, ranging anywhere from sticker packs, all the way up to private concerts from the band!
If we do not hit our target, we will still use any funds collected and put it towards recording our EP. 
If we are lucky enough to EXCEED our target, we can use the extra funding for PR, music videos, promotional photo shoots, or creating new merch! Every dollar will be put to good use!
The ImpactEvery contribution will bring us one step closer to achieving our goal to be able to record and release the music we've been working on for the past couple of years. We love our fans so much and want them to hear all of our new music so they can really get a sense of who we're becoming. We hope to spread a positive message with our music, changing the music industry and pop culture one song at a time. We are so grateful for the support of our fans thus far, helping us to create our first music video, ""A Better World (ft.

Founder, Composer and Executive Producer – Born in Italy and raised in the
beautiful ancient city of Rome.  His gift for piano composition began
blooming at the age of six. In his own words, he wishes to share with you his
dream:</p>
<p>“I
always wanted to share with everyone my dream.  However, in the past I
refrained from doing so because I knew it was not the right time for such
sharing.  Both within and outside of me, the frequencies were not right
yet.</p>
<p>And now
the time to dare into such sharing has finally come.</p>
<p>It is a
dream that always comes over and over again since my earliest childhood
time.  It comes when I am in my highest state of love and joy.  It
comes through the power of imagination, the same imagination through which I am
able to allow the melodies and the music to come through.</p>
<p>In the
dream I see thousands of us coming from everywhere on Earth gathering around
the music fully embracing the love and the oneness purging from the pure notes
and the lovingly healing sounds of the many musical instruments.</p>
<p>I see
sacred geometry shapes, breathtaking ever-changing lights and colors, images of
love all blending and dancing together with the music embracing both the
players and the listeners, taking all of them into Oneness.</p>
<p>I hear
magical whispered spoken words and singing voices gently caressing each cell of
our consciousness.  I feel everyone’s emotional releases, their letting
go, their tears of joy and their welcoming to higher energies which fully
stretch and open everyone’s hearts.  I see and feel the delicate process
of remembering, gently unfolding, taking all of us back into the full awakened
presence and light that we truly are.”</p>
<p>As
Marco shared his dream and the music, people came to offer their benevolent
time and energy to help manifest the dream.  With love in their hearts and
in true generosity of a cause greater than themselves, a team began to form
around Marco beginning a focused effort towards a goal, a goal of sharing with
the world what we all came here to accomplish. </p><p><br/></p>

It's been 5 years since our last studio album, and we are ready to get back in the studio to make a new CD. Over the last few years, we have written and collected many great songs and we are excited to share them with you.  With your help, we can make this album happen. Have a say on how the record is made!What We Need & What You Get
We have budgeted $20,000 to make this CD. I know this may seem like a lot of money, but it is a shoestring budget in the recording industry. This money will go to studio time at $500 a day, producer fees of $10,000 for the album, guest musicians, CD designer at $1,000, and finally CD duplication and printing.  
 We are offering several ways to fund the album from pre-buying the CD, to having a say on what we call the album, or being named an ""Executive Producer"". 
 If we don't reach our goal, we will still use whatever monies we raise and put them towards making the album. The Impact
We are not kidding ourselves, and we know we are raising money for a CD and not an invention that will save people's lives. Having said that, we know that our music has come to mean a lot to people, and at times, a song or a concert has changed someone's life. Music has the power to move and change people. We are asking you for help in creating something that will have an impact on a lot of people. We are asking for help in creating something artistic, everlasting, and hopefully adding a little more beauty in the world. It's a bit of a hippy ideology, but we believe it to be true.   In the past we have had success in crowdfunding as well as government grants such as Canada Council and Factor.
We guarantee that all the money will go to fund the record and nothing else. It has become harder and harder to make a living from playing music, and along with the record industry, we have seen a major decline in record sales due to downloading, and a general economic downturn in the world. Simply put, our industry has become one where artists continue to make music that they are not properly compensated for. We don't want to cry the blues too much about this, because at the end of the day, we do get by, and we are incredibly grateful that we get to play music for a living. We never take this for granted.

<p><strong>Who is Tcha Limberger?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Tcha Limberger was born into a family of musicians. His grandfather was violinist and his father a guitarist. He started playing in his father’s band “De Piottos’ first of course and later became the rhythm guitarist of Waso.<br/><br/> When he was seventeen, he started to play violin, inspired by stories of his grandfather, and recordings from Hungarian Toki Horvat. He split with the Orchestra De Piotto’s, and made a trio with his father Vivi and his uncle Bisque Limberger. A year later, they started a band named “Romani” with Koen de Cauter and two of his sons Dajo, Viv. <br/><br/> In Budapest on tour Tcha decided to return there again to learn the Gypsy music of Budapest.<br/> He learned Hungarian, and when he was twenty-three, he arrived in Budapest and studied for eighteen months with Horvat Belame.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why Tcha Limberger?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Simply put, Tcha is a complete musical genius. He is competent in many instruments such as the guitar and the violin, among many others. His knowledge of music and traditional folk/jazz styles is immense; the man hears everything and absorbs everything! I have had the fortune of spending a bit of time and picking his brain; the knowledge he has to share would be invaluable to the music community. </p>
<p><br/><strong>What kind of video projects would we do?</strong></p>
<p><br/><strong><br/></strong>Tcha's musical knowledge is encyclopedic, but for now, we have decided to focus on two general aspects of his musicianship: the guitar and the violin.</p>
<p>As far as the guitar is concerned, he grew up in the Sinti community of Django Reinhardt and is related to the legendary Waso Grunholz  who was instrumental in the development of many famous GJ gutiarists, such as Stochelo Rosenberg. Tcha's knowledge of the music of Django Reinhardt is very deep, and he is also very familiar with the folk music of the Sinti. His knowledge of harmony alone is impressive. Furthermore, he spent time learning the traditional music of Hungary and has much to say about performance and accompaniment issues in these styles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As far as the violin is concerned, he is one of the very few people (if not the only) in this world who is able to play the traditional Hungarian and Manouche folk repertoire and ABLE to teach it and explain the intricacies and nuances of the styles in fluent English, French, or any of the other 5 languages that he speaks. For the first time, this valuable information can be shared with the rest of the world.</p>

Hi. I’m Lauren Bruno, the mother of Les RAV.  The two things I love most in this world are music and community and this campaign is about both. I’m a singer and songwriter, I play piano and I’ve been paying out of pocket for every musical/communal endeavor thus far. And now I can no longer do that.

As some of you may know I've been suffering from a painful stomach disease called Ulcerative Colitis since I was 11 yrs old.
Between being in and out of the hospital, having my income go toward medical bills and having to quit my job to get well, it has made it near impossible for this album to come to fruition.  I've received so much support from the local community and fans around the world and that has given me the hope and strength that together we can make this album happen.
Music is my medicine -- I choose music over any poisonous pharmaceutical drugs and I want to share the deep gratitude and gratefulness I feel with you through the art of creating a magnificent album for you.
This is what gets me through...
Les RAV MantraLes RAV I have the right to be happyLes RAV I can learn from my mistakesLes RAV I can give more than I haveLes RAV I can use my mouth for positive changeLes RAV I am stronger than I have ever beenLes RAV I am open to accepting peace, within myself, within my heart, within my soulLes RAV 
More about Les RAV....
PressThus far Les RAV has been fortunate to be invited to showcase at both SXSW and Fusebox Festival, was featured on the PBS-KLRU Arts in Context show and was named one of Austin's top young women to watch in 2012 by Austin Women's Magazine.

</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Μέχρι σήμερα έχουμε κυκλοφορήσει τρία άλμπουμ:</span></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>“Armed angels, frustrated youth, the art of self - deceit and music industry”</i> (Poeta Negra / 2005), </span></li></ul>

<p></p>
<ul><li style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>“New Battles, without honor and humanity”</i> (No more happy music productions / 2011), </span></li></ul>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Χαρακτηριστικό της δισκογραφίας μας είναι η αλλαγή σε ύφος και μουσικό στυλ από άλμπουμ σε άλμπουμ. Για αυτό η μουσική μας είναι δύσκολο να καταταχθεί σε κάποιο συγκεκριμένο μουσικό είδος. Είναι post rock, post punk, new age, pop, rock, avant garde, και ταυτόχρονα τίποτα από όλα αυτά. Την μουσική μας μπορείτε να την βρείτε στην σελίδα μας στο <a href=""http://2l8toolate.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a> και να την κατεβάσετε με ελεύθερη συνεισφορά.</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Έχουμε εμφανιστεί σε πολυάριθμους συναυλιακούς χώρους όπως Gagarin, Bios, Κύτταρο, Synch Festival, AN Club, Στέγη Γραμμάτων και Τεχνών(Αθήνα), Υδρόγειος, Μύλος, Eightball (Θεσσαλονίκη), Rec, Λιθογραφείο (Πάτρα), καθώς και σε πολλές πόλεις της επαρχίας, ως πλήρες σχήμα, ακουστικό, ή σόλο εμφανίσεις του Κ the Clown, ιδρυτή της ομάδας.</span></p>

Συνδετικοί μας κρίκοι η ανάγκη για ελεύθερη έκφραση, για ομαδικότητα και άμεση επικοινωνία της μουσικής μας με τον κόσμο. Η άρνηση μας να συμμετέχουμε σε ένα τέτοιο παιχνίδι πελατειακών σχέσεων, μα πάνω από όλα η μουσική ως ιδέα που δεν εμπορευματοποιείται, αλλά αποτελεί αγαθό άυλο και συλλογικό, μας οδήγησε στην απόφασή να μοιραστούμε τη μουσική μας μαζί σας χωρίς μεσάζοντες. Να την θέσουμε απευθείας στη διάθεσή σας ως οικουμενικό αγαθό που δεν απαλλοτριώνεται, αλλά εξ ορισμού ανήκει στο κοινό. Διότι δεν επιθυμούμε να είμαστε απλοί παρατηρητές της αλλαγής που επιδιώκουμε να επέλθει, αλλά συμμέτοχοι αυτής με το να θέσουμε πρωτίστως τη λειτουργία της μουσικής ομάδας μας σε ένα πλαίσιο εξωσυστημικό...</span></p>

- Ποιοι είναι οι 2L8 (scroll down for english version)




Ας μιλήσουμε λίγο για εμάς.

Μέχρι σήμερα έχουμε κυκλοφορήσει τρία άλμπουμ:

“Armed angels, frustrated youth, the art of self - deceit and music industry” (Poeta Negra / 2005), 


“He&She, Angry enough to keep loving in the Dark Ages” (Inner Ear / 2008), 


“New Battles, without honor and humanity” (No more happy music productions / 2011), 

Χαρακτηριστικό της δισκογραφίας μας είναι η αλλαγή σε ύφος και μουσικό στυλ από άλμπουμ σε άλμπουμ. Για αυτό η μουσική μας είναι δύσκολο να καταταχθεί σε κάποιο συγκεκριμένο μουσικό είδος. Είναι post rock, post punk, new age, pop, rock, avant garde, και ταυτόχρονα τίποτα από όλα αυτά. Την μουσική μας μπορείτε να την βρείτε στην σελίδα μας στο Bandcamp και να την κατεβάσετε με ελεύθερη συνεισφορά.
Έχουμε εμφανιστεί σε πολυάριθμους συναυλιακούς χώρους όπως Gagarin, Bios, Κύτταρο, Synch Festival, AN Club, Στέγη Γραμμάτων και Τεχνών(Αθήνα), Υδρόγειος, Μύλος, Eightball (Θεσσαλονίκη), Rec, Λιθογραφείο (Πάτρα), καθώς και σε πολλές πόλεις της επαρχίας, ως πλήρες σχήμα, ακουστικό, ή σόλο εμφανίσεις του Κ the Clown, ιδρυτή της ομάδας.

- H ιδέα πίσω από τους 2L8

Οι 2L8 έχουν να κάνουν με την ομάδα. Στη σκηνή και εκτός σκηνής. Η σύλληψη της ιδέας να προσδώσουμε στη μουσική μας έναν χαρακτήρα συλλογικό, και μη ιεραρχικό, υπήρξε αποτέλεσμα του κοινού συναισθήματος, της αντίθεσης μας στην εξουσιαστική δομή της κοινωνίας. Συνδετικοί μας κρίκοι η ανάγκη για ελεύθερη έκφραση, για ομαδικότητα και άμεση επικοινωνία της μουσικής μας με τον κόσμο. Η άρνηση μας να συμμετέχουμε σε ένα τέτοιο παιχνίδι πελατειακών σχέσεων, μα πάνω από όλα η μουσική ως ιδέα που δεν εμπορευματοποιείται, αλλά αποτελεί αγαθό άυλο και συλλογικό, μας οδήγησε στην απόφασή να μοιραστούμε τη μουσική μας μαζί σας χωρίς μεσάζοντες. Να την θέσουμε απευθείας στη διάθεσή σας ως οικουμενικό αγαθό που δεν απαλλοτριώνεται, αλλά εξ ορισμού ανήκει στο κοινό. Διότι δεν επιθυμούμε να είμαστε απλοί παρατηρητές της αλλαγής που επιδιώκουμε να επέλθει, αλλά συμμέτοχοι αυτής με το να θέσουμε πρωτίστως τη λειτουργία της μουσικής ομάδας μας σε ένα πλαίσιο εξωσυστημικό...

- Προηγούμενη εμπειρία από crowdfunding
Η δίψα λοιπόν για ελεύθερη έκφραση και διακίνηση ιδεών, μας έκανε να στραφούμε για το τρίτο μας άλμπουμ ""New Battles, without honor and humanity"" στην χρηματοδότηση από το κοινό. Μία κίνηση που θα μας έδειχνε κατά πόσο η μουσική μας είναι απαραίτητη στον κόσμο.Η απήχηση του κόσμου καιτο αποτέλεσμα μας δικαίωσαν. Παλιοί φίλοι και νέοι, μας χρηματοδότησαν, στο μέγεθος της οικονομικής βοήθειας που μπορούσε ο καθένας να συνεισφέρει.

Και τελικά καταφέραμε να κρατήσουμε ακέραια τα δικαιώματα της μουσική μας και να έχουμε εμείς το λόγο για το πως θα τη μοιραζόμαστε με το κοινό.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>2012 was Elisium's best year to date! 2013 is shaping up to be EVEN better.  We've been playing shows with awesome bands, playing great new markets, and gaining new friends and fans at every stop.  A week ago, we were leaving a show and hit some snow, and our van wrecked into a tree.  :( Our trailer and van are totaled.  So, we have no choice but to ask for help. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Here is the situation we are in, honestly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our van and trailer are totaled, and need to be replaced.</li>
<li>The trailer will cost between $1500-2500, and the cost of our van is unknown</li>
<li>Our schedule of summer festivals keeps filling up, and our hope is to not miss a SINGLE show - but that will take a group effort (Thank you in advance!!)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<li>SHARE this fundraiser - post it on your Facebook page, your Twitter, Instagram, email it to your friends and family, help us reach as many people as we can!</li>
<li>Have a bake sale, or fundraiser of your own! One of our awesome friends who makes jewelry gave me this idea, she's created some custom Elisium items, and is donating a portion of the sales to our cause.  Awesome!</li>

<h3>About Myself + The New Album</h3>
<p>For those who haven't met me, I am a singer-songwriter living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and I'm about 75% of my way through making my 4th album, <em>Chrysalis</em>. <span>It's been a beautiful adventure so far...I kinda feel like there are angels watching over this one.</span></p>
<p><strong>Side A:</strong> In the Summer of 2012, on the heels of 3 years of illness, and with the help of nearly 140 people, I raised over $8,000 for the recording sessions for <em>Chrysalis</em>. Since then, the project has been in very good hands with my co-producer and the incredible musicians. We began recording in November in Pittsburgh. Even in their rough state, the new songs have a real vibe and appeal. So excited about this! </p>
<p><strong>Side B:</strong> Now that we're well into the recording sessions I am looking ahead for ways to fund the post-production in February. In all humility, my friends and fans helped me rock the first campaign, and working towards ""paying back"" my sponsors with music and gifts rather than money is a brand new experience for me. I love it so far, and want to keep the momentum going. </p>
<h3>Why the Campaign &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Making recordings can be expensive, like buying a new car -- in my case an economy car and not a Tesla! Through Indiegogo, I am seeking people, such as yourself, to essentially pre-order my album as a way to fund its production. Your support will sponsor the mixing, mastering, artist/album design, and so on. This is the final stretch and every little bit helps!</p>
<p>When you donate to one of the levels of the campaign you get the album <em>before</em> it's released plus receive other unique perks that only backers (that's you) have access to PLUS!...if you pre-order before December 31, 2012, I will add a bonus track to<em> any</em> pledge level!</p>
<p>You can also:</p>
<p><strong>SHARE: </strong>My 'Side A' campaign was largely successful because of enthusiastic support on Facebook. As an introvert, this support is huge, and I invite you to share my page with your networks and friends. Be my megaphone. I will do what I can to megaphone you back.</p>
<h3>Every Little Bit </h3>
<p>What you should know is that Indiegogo is an on-going proposition. Backing/pre-orders happen in real time. I know times aren't so easy, but whatever support you could provide would be greatly appreciated, and all of it will count. Indiegogo's flex funding is a WIN-WIN: whether I reach my goal or not, you will still get the music and your selected perks, and I will still receive resources to keep working.</p>
<p>I very much want to share the new music with you. Thanks again for stopping by, considering backing my project and helping me bring this home. You will allow this album to happen!</p>
<p>XO </p>

<p>Performances will take place on May 11 &amp; 12, 2012 at the Renaissance Charter School, with students  making both tech and musical contributions at all levels.</p>

We have received a small grant form the Queens Council for the Arts, and community support from local merchants and banks. As the renaissance school is generously donating their auditorium, almost all funding will go toward artist fees. With 15 solo roles and additional chorus, the total comes to $7500. Many of the singers have agreed to a sliding scale based on our fund-raising success, but we will need to raise at least $2500 in addition to the grants we already have. There will be minimal prop/costume and meal expense, absorbed somewhat by in-kind contributions from the community.</p>
<p>The impact of producing this world-premiere event in this community is immense. the cast is ethnically mixed, as is the group of participating students.

<h3>Opera is not obsolete.  Popular opinion of opera is.</h3>
<p>One Ounce Opera aims to put opera in unexpected places - your local pub, live music stages tenured by bands and DJ's, outdoor festivals, and of course, private celebrations and fundraising benefits.</p>
<p>Why ""One Ounce"" Opera?  Two reasons, really.  First, OOO aims to provide a come-and-go, laid back, interactive atmosphere to experience a virtuosic sonic event up close -- in small, powerful doses (just “one ounce” of opera).  Secondly, we welcome a few ounces of adult beverages both during and after, and hope to ""share an ounce"" with you soon, in the spirit of music and fellowship -- two things we believe in passionately.</p>
<p>This fantastic ensemble of professional, dedicated singing-artists was assembled after local auditions in April. As Founder and General Director, I carefully chose people who committed to strong and fearless performances.  You will truly see something new, different, and exciting every single show.  You will immediately sense each singer's love for what they do and what they have trained tirelessly for.</p>
<p>Austin is ripe for innovation.  We want to be a part of the musical landscape in Central Texas for years to come.  We are Opera, Austinfied.  And we need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Opera ain't cheap - even if the beer is.</p>
<p>My OOO Team has already given so much of their time and talents, simply out of passion in this project and our unique vision for the music we love to sing.  Moving forward, we must reach out to fully realize our potential.  This is where we turn the spotlight on YOU.</p>
<p>Quite literally, we cannot do this without you.  Every single contribution, regardless of amount, will directly fund imperative actions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchasing of musical and sound equipment - quality portable electronic keyboard, piano bench, music stands, speakers, monitors, specialty microphones, cords, amps, PA's</li>
<li>Our pianists - they do this for a living, y'all.  No rehearsal or show can ""go on"" without them. Their expertise is absolutely essential to a successful company.</li>
<li>Space and time - rehearsal space rental, workshop space rental, and down the road just a bit, theatre or large venue rental / time for showcasing a new opera written by a local composer.</li>
<li>Odds and Ends - copies (and copies and copies...), administration help, website hosting, marketing and promotions, purchasing a banner and a backdrop, buying boas (yes, boas - don't judge), a few $ for gas (can't ride Valkyries everywhere).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Will Do With It</h3>
<p>Our objectives are simple, powerful, and most definitely possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage a new generation of “opera lovers” with culturally significant, non-traditional venue and program choices.</li>
<li>Become a respected artistic company of professional singing-artists and musicians providing memorable alternative musical experiences, while promoting opera and classical singing as a vibrant, current, accessible art form.</li>
<li>Challenge our singing-artists to perform with every inch of their talent, both vocally and dramatically.</li>
<li>Give our singing-artists a platform to explore new repertoire, share the stage with their peers, and perfect their craft in front of a very live audience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Show Support</h3>
<p>Spread the word, folks!  ""Like"" our page on Facebook, follow @OneOunceOpera on Twitter, share our website with friends and family, and bring your peeps to shows.  We can always use Street Team Members, willing to hang posters at coffee houses and hand out flyers wearing horns (*optional).</p>
<h3>Our Thanks to You</h3>
<p>On Thursday, August 23rd, with your support and contributions, we will present a GRAND LAUNCH SHOW AND PARTY at the newly-tricked-out Red 7, right in the heart of the Live Music Capital of the World.  What better place for us to meet and thank every person who has made One Ounce Opera a successful, viable artistic company, born from the spirit of Austin and the dream of a crazy soprano.</p>
<p>PS - you MAY give anonymously, or elect to not show the amount or your name publicly.  See the options available by clicking ""contribute now"". </p>

Why ""One Ounce"" Opera?  Two reasons, really.  First, OOO aims to provide a come-and-go, laid back, interactive atmosphere to experience a virtuosic sonic event up close -- in small, powerful doses (just “one ounce” of opera).  Secondly, we welcome a few ounces of adult beverages both during and after, and hope to ""share an ounce"" with you soon, in the spirit of music and fellowship -- two things we believe in passionately.
This fantastic ensemble of professional, dedicated singing-artists was assembled after local auditions in April. As Founder and General Director, I carefully chose people who committed to strong and fearless performances.  You will truly see something new, different, and exciting every single show.  You will immediately sense each singer's love for what they do and what they have trained tirelessly for.
Austin is ripe for innovation.  We want to be a part of the musical landscape in Central Texas for years to come.  We are Opera, Austinfied.  And we need your help.
 
What We Need


Opera ain't cheap - even if the beer is.
My OOO Team has already given so much of their time and talents, simply out of passion in this project and our unique vision for the music we love to sing.  Moving forward, we must reach out to fully realize our potential.  This is where we turn the spotlight on YOU.
Quite literally, we cannot do this without you.  Every single contribution, regardless of amount, will directly fund imperative actions like:

Purchasing of musical and sound equipment - quality portable electronic keyboard, piano bench, music stands, speakers, monitors, specialty microphones, cords, amps, PA's
Our pianists - they do this for a living, y'all.  No rehearsal or show can ""go on"" without them. Their expertise is absolutely essential to a successful company.
Space and time - rehearsal space rental, workshop space rental, and down the road just a bit, theatre or large venue rental / time for showcasing a new opera written by a local composer.
Odds and Ends - copies (and copies and copies...), administration help, website hosting, marketing and promotions, purchasing a banner and a backdrop, buying boas (yes, boas - don't judge), a few $ for gas (can't ride Valkyries everywhere).



What We Will Do With It
Our objectives are simple, powerful, and most definitely possible:

Encourage a new generation of “opera lovers” with culturally significant, non-traditional venue and program choices.
Become a respected artistic company of professional singing-artists and musicians providing memorable alternative musical experiences, while promoting opera and classical singing as a vibrant, current, accessible art form.
Challenge our singing-artists to perform with every inch of their talent, both vocally and dramatically.
Give our singing-artists a platform to explore new repertoire, share the stage with their peers, and perfect their craft in front of a very live audience.

Other Ways You Can Show Support
Spread the word, folks!  ""Like"" our page on Facebook, follow @OneOunceOpera on Twitter, share our website with friends and family, and bring your peeps to shows.  We can always use Street Team Members, willing to hang posters at coffee houses and hand out flyers wearing horns (*optional).
Our Thanks to You
On Thursday, August 23rd, with your support and contributions, we will present a GRAND LAUNCH SHOW AND PARTY at the newly-tricked-out Red 7, right in the heart of the Live Music Capital of the World.  What better place for us to meet and thank every person who has made One Ounce Opera a successful, viable artistic company, born from the spirit of Austin and the dream of a crazy soprano.
PS - you MAY give anonymously, or elect to not show the amount or your name publicly.  See the options available by clicking ""contribute now"".",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

We are calling this the Tour of ABUNDANCE because we believe that all we need is available for us, and all we do in love will flourish with great prosperity!</p>
<p>We'll be traveling for over a month, beginning at the end of May. This tour is important to us because it helps us connect with more of YOU! As a divine harmony collective of 12 powerful women (sometimes more), we are fully aware of the divine energy within connecting with love, and expanding as we learn more and more of ourselves through these connections.

<p>Resonance Meditation is what we call our genre of music. Sometimes it's rhythmic, sometimes it's ethereal. Sometimes we whisper, sometimes we sign with the force of 144,000 tribes. The focus of our Resonance Meditation is to help bring about the feelings and experiences of personal alignment! We believe meditation can be for people of all ages, from all walks of life.</p>
<p>We created our form of Resonance Meditation after months of preparing for only one show. Once we had come together, practiced, and fallen in love with our experiences of Beautiful Chorus, we knew we had to share it.... and so, Resonance Meditation and the Tour of ABUNDANCE were born!</p>

<p>In a live setting, the unique blending of harmonies by Beautiful Chorus, coupled with the pure tones of crystal and alchemy bowls, brings the experience of Resonance Meditation to new levels. With innovative soundscapes and elegant vocal expressions, the undulating waves of harmonies are truly transcendent and will have you reaching deeper and more personal states of clarity, self-awareness, and refreshing calm.</p>
<p>Our studio recordings are a combination of Beautiful Chorus voices and the production mastery of Divinci of Solillaquists of Sound. The flow and ease of these songs helps to release mental resistence, which in itself... is exactly what we mean by 'meditation.' We've been recording our album to be ready for our tour this Summer.</p>
<p>On this tour, we'll be focusing on two types of shows</p>
<ul>
<li>Live Resonance Meditations in places like yoga studios, resonant environments, and in-home private sessions, where all participants will be invited to bathe in the sounds of Beautiful Chorus.</li>
<li>Music Festival and large group settings where we can play with the tones and melodies created by lots of loving people in an artistically diverse environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll also offer a limited amount of very special, private meditations for individuals and small groups of close friends. These are perfect if you'd like to personally hire Beautiful Chorus to help you set an intention and cultivate its focused creation within your own space and personal being. Write to us at <a href=""mailto:beautifulchorus@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">beautifulchorus@gmail.com </a>for more info on these types of sessions.</p>

<p>Day by day, we are coming to an even greater understanding of the power within being able to share these songs and practices with you. This tour is about US + YOU, and we're so excited to see what may come of our dreams intertwining.</p>
<p>Each of us is responsible (able to respond) to the inner calling of personal alignment. All of us here in BC know that this can be an exciting focus, an exhilarating ride, and a path filled with light. Meditation, and bringing oneself into the experience of alignment, is always possible with practice. We've cultivated and specifically tailored our meditations to fit within both large and small group/individual settings.</p>
<p><strong>Intimate, Private, and Small Group Sessions</strong></p>

<p>The deep, personal quality of small group resonance (30-100 people), allows for the participants to focus easily within themselves, bringing the experience of interconnectedness from within to the external group. Smaller venues also allow for the nuances of natural, vocal meditation, to be heard. It is in these more intimate settings that Beautiful Chorus will often travel throughout the room, providing a 360 degree soundscape for everyone who has gathered.</p>
<p><strong>Community and Large Group Meditations</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""crowdsoflove"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i39.photobucket.com/albums/e168/Solillaquists/New%20Indiegogo/festivalAb.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""crowdsoflove""/></p>
<p>The celebratory energy of large groups is one of the most intense and powerful ways for people to experience the feeling of coming into alignment, and experiencing their relationship to a larger whole. Once a resonant field has been established amongst a large group, it carries with it an outstandingly strong momentous force.</p>

<p>Beautiful Chorus started with Love, is sustaining in Love, and imagines an experience of pure Love in all ever-present visualizations.  Resonance Meditation is a powerful tool for upliftment, for peace, for ease and clarity. There is a key that we have found within our resonant tones, within the spaces between our tones. We are honest, we are always growing, and our adventure is exceeding even our greatest expectations on the daily.</p>
<p>We love our calling to share the feelings we've discovered, with you. We love our calling to share this resonance, this bliss, and this fun. Love is our greatest foundation. Beautiful Chorus exists because of Love Unconditional. </p>

<p>You can listen, sing along, hum the melody in your head, or just sit back and relax. Meditation is truly a journey, and every journey begins with a single step.

<p>Hey lovely people!  We're Dan and Megan, also known as The Blackwood Two.  We're fundraising cash-money to record and release our new album, and we need YOUR help to make it happen!</p>
<p>In December 2010 we released our first EP, which we recorded and packaged entirely ourselves.  That EP allowed us to tour from coast to coast, play some great gigs, and meet some amazing people.  Now, with a bunch of new original material, an evolving sound, and a little more experience, we're very excited to record a brand new album.</p>
<p>With your help, we can make this new album a reality.  Your donations will make you directly involved with the creation of this album, and together we'll make it happen!  We literally wont be able to acheive the results we want without you, and we're excited about the idea of having all the wonderful people we've met along the way be part of this!</p>
<p><strong>The Deets</strong></p>
<p>We're asking for $3000.  This probably sounds like a lot (it IS alot!); however you can rest assured it's a reasonable amount for the creation of a new album.</p>
<p>This money will be divided into:<br/>- recording costs (studio time, mixing, mastering)<br/>- CD duplication costs<br/>- packaging (CD sleeves and printing)</p>
<p>We have some pretty sweet perks listed on the right of the page!  Every donation gets some kind of perk, including a copy of the new album.  Think of donating as pre-buying the album in order to fund its creation.  Pretty cool!  Every amount helps.  Check out the perks and donate what feels good to you!</p>
<p><strong>All in All</strong></p>
<p>Bottom line:  we're pumped about our new material.  It's high time we get a new album out.  We want our friends, family, and fans to be a part of the process.  We think it's going to sound sweet, and hopefully be a meaningful contribution to the new Canadian folk canon.  We want you along for the ride!</p>
<p>ALSO, please please please, share this link, share the video, spread the word, tell your friends.  Monetary support certainly isn't the only way to help (although that's cool too).</p>
<p>Thanks very much everyone.  We're looking forward to making this happen!</p>

<p>Peace and Love,</p>

<p class=""p1"">I'm making an album about zombies! And George W. Bush! How could you not already be sold?!</p>
<p class=""p1"">Broadly speaking, the album will be industrial, but it's not being constrained to hardline interpretations of the genre. Think early 80s industrial that grew out of early electronic, cold wave, etc. Fans of Skinny Puppy, Depeche Mode, Kraftwerk, early video games (8-bit &amp; 16-bit), Front Line Assembly and a bunch of other bands will feel right at home with my music.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So, here's the setup for the album's concept:</p>
<p class=""p1""><em>In another reality, George W. Bush is still President of the United States. The recent rash of cannibalistic, zombie-like attacks have turned out to be the harbinger of an actual zombie apocalypse. Turns out that the Mayan calendar predicted the full outbreak with almost laser-like precision.</em></p>
<p class=""p3""><em>As the country descends into terror, carnage and societal revolt, President Bush enacts a plan to round up, inter and quarantine the zombies, believing that there may be a cure for the infection, that they may yet be helped.</em></p>
<p class=""p3""><em>Ultimately, this plan proves futile, and the zombies break free of the government's containment facilities, overrunning and decimating the federal forces keeping them in check. Because nearly all the nation's defenses have been stationed at quarantine facilities, there are few organized forces left in place to fight the coming horde.</em></p>
<p class=""p3""><em>As chaos descends, the nation struggles to maintain order and safety and ultimately largely succumbs to the undead threat. Bands of survivors hold together and fight back against the horde, which is eventually defeated, but only at catastrophic cost to humanity.</em></p>
<p class=""p3"">The problem is this: I need a bit more equipment than I currently have to finish this album. </p>
<p class=""p4""> </p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><strong>What Will The Final Product Be?</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p3"">Primarily, it's a downloadable album of music. If this fundraising exercise is successful, there will also be a digital download of a comic book that tells the story of the album.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Want to hear some of the album to know what you're contributing to? I don't blame you, I'd want to know what I was funding before I gave my money to the cause, too! So you can get a taste for what the album will sound like, I've loaded up two of the tracks that you can stream (or purchase, if you choose) from BandCamp:</p>
<p class=""p3""><a href=""http://99kmusic.bandcamp.com/track/internment"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://99kmusic.bandcamp.com/track/internment</a><br/><a href=""http://99kmusic.bandcamp.com/track/epidemic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://99kmusic.bandcamp.com/track/epidemic<br/></a></p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>What Do You Get For Helping Fund This Campaign?</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1"">First and foremost, you'll get access to the album and that warm fuzzy feeling of knowing you've helped make it a reality! If I don't get fully funded, the first thing to go will be the comic, which I can work on after the album is done. However, I plan to proceed and work to finish this project regardless. People who have earned perks will get them, regardless of the goal being met.</p>
<p class=""p2"">If you contribute at least $10, you'll get a link to download the album as soon as it's ready for release.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If you contribute at least $20, you'll get the album, plus access to the video diary I'm starting about the process of writing and producing this album. This video diary will cover the last 5-7 songs I'm writing for the album.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If you contribute at least $30, you'll get the album, access to my video diary, plus a link to all the b-sides that won't be included on the final album. There are a few pretty cool songs that won't make the cut, and this is your opportunity to have them.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If you contribute at least $50, you'll get the album, access to my video diary, the b-sides and your name in the credits for the album.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If I exceed funding significantly, the top contributors will get additional awesome stuff that may include physical copies of the album, physical copies of the comic or other awesome stuff. I'm structuring this fundraising campaign to be as bare-bones as possible. I'm not asking for help funding any kind of payment for this album, only help funding the equipment I need to make it. So, I can't say what higher level perks would be because I'm not shooting for a whole lot of money for this. Suffice it to say, I want to say thank you to everyone who helps this dream of mine become a reality, and I will make sure that I reward people as generously as I possibly can, above and beyond the perks I've outlined.</p>

<p class=""p1""><em>The keyboard I presently have is a two-octave mini keyboard. Creating music on this type of keyboard is incredibly difficult due to the size of the keys, which are roughly 40% smaller than standard. The Akai Pro keyboard allows for many more on-the-fly adjustments, which will allow me to create better, more interesting sounding songs.</em></p>
<p class=""p1"">• AKG Perception 120 USB Microphone ($135) - <strong>PURCHASED</strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/AKG-PERCEPTION-120-USB-Microphone/dp/B003DSI62U/ref=sr_1_2?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343924662&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=AKG+Perception+120"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/AKG-PERCEPTION-120-USB-Microphone/dp/B003DSI62U/ref=sr_1_2?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343924662&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=AKG+Perception+120</a></p>
<p class=""p1""><em>I do not presently own a recording quality microphone. Every time I have recorded vocals in the past, I have done so at friends' home studios or using borrowed equipment. This is a great quality digital mic at a reasonable price that will allow me to add vocals to this album.</em></p>
<p class=""p1"">• Logic Pro ($200) - <strong>PURCHASED</strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><a href=""http://www.apple.com/logicpro/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/logicpro/</a></p>
<p class=""p1""><em>I presently mix and master all my music in Audacity. It gets the job done, but it's certainly not the most elegant or powerful solution. In the end, I firmly believe that adding a high-quality post-production suite will allow me to create a much more compelling album. I have used Logic Pro in the past and am familiar with its workflow. Transitioning my knowledge of mixing and mastering to a new software tool will not be a difficult process.</em></p>
<p class=""p1"">• Art ($400) - <strong>INSUFFICIENT FUNDING</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">This album is based on a story I've written. I'm working with a very talented artist to finalize the comic form of the story, which will be included as a digital download with the album.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Total expense: $1152 before taxes, shipping and fees.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Fees: IndieGogo charges either 4% or 9%, depending on whether the project is funded fully. PayPal also charges me about 3%. These fees add up quickly, as do taxes and shipping. The difference between total expenses and the goal will be used to cover these additional costs.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Total goal: $1500</p>
<p class=""p1"">If I am lucky enough to raise more than my goal, I'll use that money to fund additional software purchases. The more software I have, the more I can do with the album to create lots of awesome, varied soundscapes. If I'm lucky enough to go beyond that level, I'll look into options for printing physical copies of the album on CD and maybe even on vinyl! No matter what, you can rest assured that whatever you donate will be funneled directly into the composition, production, editing, mixing, mastering and distribution of this album.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>What I Already Have And Am Using (And Why I Need Even More Stuff)</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1"">• Native Instruments Maschine</p>
<p class=""p1"">Maschine is an incredibly powerful software / hardware combination that allows for extremely tight composition. It uses a physical (midi based) controller that's designed specifically to work with the Maschine software. It's really an awesome tool and integrates seamlessly with other Native Instruments software like Komplete.</p>
<p class=""p2"">• Native Instruments Komplete 8</p>
<p class=""p1"">This is the basis for most of the sounds I use. Komplete comes with a heaping helping of incredible synths, but falls a bit short on the drums for industrial music. I am an avid user of FM8, Reaktor, Absynth and Guitar Rig, which allow me to create most of the sounds I'll be using on this album.</p>
<p class=""p1"">• Studio Hardware</p>
<p class=""p1"">I have a great little home studio. For mixing and mastering I use Tannoy Reveal 501a monitors and Audio Technica ATH-M50 headphones. I write, edit, mix and master on a MacBook Pro. I've been working with digital recording for about 12 years now. </p>
<p class=""p1"">• Akai MPK Pro Mini USB MIDI Keyboard Controller</p>
<p class=""p1"">This keyboard is an abomination. For use on the go, it's passable, but as a main keyboard for composing, it's absolutely terrible. The keys are about 30-40% smaller than standard, making playing in keys other than CMaj and Am a near impossibility. It is definitely the largest bottleneck I have in terms of composing.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>My Background In Music</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1"">When I was 5, I started playing the piano. At 8, I began flute lessons. I took flute lessons, played in the school's band and, there, learned to play several other woodwinds as well. When I turned 14, I began taking guitar lessons and stopped flute lessons. I took guitar lessons from the time I was 14 until I was nearly 19 and went to college. During high school, I played in the school's jazz band as lead guitarist and also played in a few punk and metal bands. I also took 3 years of music theory and composition classes. When I went to college, I began playing more with friends and started up another band with some friends. We mostly played metal, often with an industrial bent, and I learned to play the drums and bass. I also took up the mandolin while in college and started tinkering with digital recording and electronic composition. In college, I also took another couple years of music theory and composition.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In the 7 years since I graduated, I've kept playing guitar and have begun working more with electronic composition. I started out with FruityLoops and Cakewalk, dipped my toes into the hardware side of electronic music with a few synths and progressed into using Propellerheads' Reason software. Since then I've started using Maschine as my primary mode of composition, and I absolutely love it!</p>
<p class=""p1"">Music has been an integral part of my life for as long as I can remember. I've finally gotten to a point where I have the time to really dedicate myself to making an album that I think is worth releasing and that I think a lot of people will really enjoy.</p>

Well it was until spring 2020...</p><p>Because of the global COVID-19 -crisis I haven’t been able to do either of my professions: touring with my bands nor working as a kindergarten teacher’s substitute. This meant that I had lots of time in my hands and many unfinished songs and obviously a strong lyrical theme from just seeing what’s happening around the world and how people are reacting to this crisis, so I decided to use this time to fulfill the dream of my very first solo release.

<h3>ED MONDO:</h3>
<br/><h3>Diana Tejera -cantautrice- (dianatejera.com) ed Ersilia Prosperi -trombettista ed ideatrice di OU (oumusic.org).<br/>Ed MONDO è la comunanza di fluttuazioni emotive e psichiche che ha permesso ai nostri ,apparentemente inconciliabili, mondi sonori e creativi di unirsi in un nuovo, fresco, autentico, unico e compatto universo: ED MONDO. <br/>
</h3>
<h3>Le canzoni che faranno parte del disco sono 10 stagioni interiori ispirate agli eventi appena passati e alle cronache funamboliche di quotidianità vissute durante la scrittura degli stessi. <br/>
</h3>
<h3>ED MONDO è più di un progetto musicale</h3>
<h3>è un laboratorio per la ricerca e la promozione di 10 elaborazioni resilienti di:<br/>
</h3>
<h3>

Diana Tejera -cantautrice- (dianatejera.com) ed Ersilia Prosperi -trombettista ed ideatrice di OU (oumusic.org).Ed MONDO è la comunanza di fluttuazioni emotive e psichiche che ha permesso ai nostri ,apparentemente inconciliabili, mondi sonori e creativi di unirsi in un nuovo, fresco, autentico, unico e compatto universo: ED MONDO. 

Le canzoni che faranno parte del disco sono 10 stagioni interiori ispirate agli eventi appena passati e alle cronache funamboliche di quotidianità vissute durante la scrittura degli stessi. 

ED MONDO è più di un progetto musicale
è un laboratorio per la ricerca e la promozione di 10 elaborazioni resilienti di:

<p>Hello there! We're <b>Circus Maximus</b>, a progressive metal band from Norway. On February 6th of 2016 we celebrated the release of our latest studio album '<b>HAVOC</b>' with a party at the famous Rockefeller in Oslo, with a live production that involved pyrotechnics, sparks, and a really big light rig. </p>
<p>We invested a lot into this show to make it one of the most memorable nights in Circus Maximus history. We want to share this night with the world so we recorded it with <b>multiple high definition cameras</b> for a high quality release both on <b>BluRay</b> and <b>DVD</b>, together with<b> 2 CDs</b>. </p> <p style=""text-align: left;""></p>

We plan to add special extras like behind-the-scenes footage of the show, our latest music video and hopefully more as this campaign progresses! </span></p><p>We know that the prices are relatively high, especially if you live outside of Europe.

In its first year the non-profit offered several internships, scholarships and launched its biggest event of the year, Fashion Meets Music Festival. This year's festival has a new location and an edgy lineup of musicians plus fashion designers. The festival was created to help support both local and national musicians, fashion designers, models and all students interested in pursuing a career in the arts.</p><h3><strong>Why We Need YOU To Join Our Movement</strong></h3><p>Let's face it, there are many hidden issues that students in the arts face. Four of the biggest ones include <strong>time</strong>, <strong>talent</strong>, <strong>networking</strong>, and <strong>money</strong>. The Fusion Foundation is a non-profit that relies on donations to help provide scholarships, grants, internships, equipment, fabric and several other necessities for those trying to make a name for themselves in ""the industry"".

<h3>Hello...</h3>
<p>We're Porch Light Apothecary, a 4-piece indie/rock/americana band from Raleigh, NC. It's been quite a journey since the release of our <a href=""https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/porchlightapothecary3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first studio album in 2016</a>. </p>
<p>Along the way we've had many ups and downs. The ups have been great, but it seems that the past two years have brought us great struggles within our families and as world citizens. Through those difficult times of darkness we've been able to find light and positivity through writing, shaping, playing and re-shaping new songs. A lot of emotion has been wrapped up in them and we hope that you, too, will find the spacious place to sit with these songs and let them help you to lift whatever weight may be on your heart. </p>
<p>We recorded the 12 songs for <strong>Weight of the Heart </strong>with <a href=""http://arborridgestudios.squarespace.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Crawford at Arbor Ridge Studios</a> in Chapel Hill, NC earlier this year. We were extremely grateful to have some of the area's most talented musicians lend their services on the album. <a href=""http://www.anneclairemusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anne-Claire Niver</a> added vocal accompaniment on three tracks and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/autumnbrandmusic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Autumn Brand</a> played violin on <i>Dark was the Night</i>. Jeff Crawford also added bass and upright bass to a couple tracks, as well as backing vocals on <i>House Burned Down.</i> </p>
<p>You can help us speed towards our goal by adding a limited-edition screen printed poster by George Hage, a shirt, stickers, buttons, and more. We are very excited about the way this album sounds and can't wait to share it with you.</p>

We're porting and translating to other regions at the moment but the main barrier is the cost of getting our game rated and also fees to put onto distribution services too.

</div></div>","The Reason Why We Need Your Help The cost of game development is expensive, especially for brand new indie studios. We're porting and translating to other regions at the moment but the main barrier is the cost of getting our game rated and also fees to put onto distribution services too. We can either wait until sales pick up on the North America version, but payouts are far out in between, OR we could come to IndieGoGo and have a chance to get it out much sooner and reward people who are interested! 
We are hoping the latter works out so that we can bring PING 1.5+ onto Wii U for EU and Germany. If the funding goes above what we ask for, we could look into other smaller regions or adding new content depending on reception.

<p><strong>HELLO FRIENDS, SUPPORTERS OF ART AND MUSIC!</strong></p>
<p>Artists these days (maybe always?) have a difficult time making a living - but we believe what we do is important. Do you? The sensitivity of collaboration, the beauty of air through a reed or a bow on a string, the poignant translation of a traditional text set to melody, a belief in the power of sound. This is what we do as AALLOTAR. </p>
<p>We hope you will help us fund the final steps of ' Ameriikan laulu ' album. If you are unfamiliar with our work, please watch the video or listen to our 2014 'In Transit' album available on our <a href=""http://www.aallotarmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aallotar website</a>. We believe 'Ameriikan laulu' represents us even more and we are excited to get it in your hands! (Read more about Aallotar below)</p>
<p><strong>WHY MAKE AN ALBUM?</strong></p>
<p>I suppose you know that 'average' artists make next to nothing from streaming services. Like, we see almost NO money. And we do this for a living. As Aallotar, we love to perform live for audiences, and generally, audiences want to take our music home with them. So we make CDs so they can sit in a chair, listen to the studio album, read the lyrics, have their own experience in private. And we make more money to pay our rent. That's why! </p>
<p><strong>SO...</strong></p>
<p>Pre-order the album to help us finish the album! To mix, master, print, and promote. We think and hope the album will inspire, soothe, transport. Could you regret that?</p>
<p><strong>Thank you / Kiitos!<br/>Sara &amp; Teija</strong></p>
<p>P.S. If you don't have funds right now to contribute, no problem! But please share with those who do - use the Indigogo share buttons to the right of the video above.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT AALLOTAR</strong></p>
<p>""Extra elusive appeal, its lightness of touch and melodiousness of repertoire matching the skill of the musicians."" fRoots. </p>
<p>'Fresh, skillful and imaginative playing.' Kansanmusiikki (Finland)</p>
<p>Aallotar is a transatlantic collaboration (Sara Pajunen, violin &amp; voice &amp; effects / Teija Niku, accordion &amp; voice) that uses Finnish and Finnish-American music as a starting point for an original 'chamber-folk’ style.</p>
<p>Ancestors of Sara Pajunen and Teija Niku lived within hours of each other in western Finland - speaking the same language, playing the same music, living the same culture. In the late 19th century, Pajunen's ancestors emigrated to northern Minnesota; Niku's family remained in Finland. Today, they explore a common heritage in Finnish folk music, even as they create new sounds that reflect their contemporary cultures and various interests. Pajunen is a violinist, and Niku and accordionist; their lithe instrumentals and beautiful vocal harmonies in both Finnish and English demonstrate how gracefully traditional and modern folk music can speak together. <br/>Aallotar has performed throughout the United States and at European festivals, including Kaustinen Folk Music Festival and Sounds of the North in Gdansk, Poland. They released their debut recording 'In Transit' in 2014 and will release 'Ameriikan laulu' in spring 2018. </p>

Revolution Books Needs Your Support to Move, Renovate & Revitalize
 




Revolution Books Berkeley has been at its current space for 27 years – a center of the revolution, a “Berkeley institution” as poet Bob Hass put it, and one of the “Top 20 Bay Area independent bookstores.” (SF Chronicle).  The bookstore has hosted hundreds of author events, political forums, artistic performances, and provided a unique and cutting edge revolutionary book selection in Northern California. 

Now Revolution Books has the need – and opportunity – to move into a new space at 2444 Durant in Berkeley by August 1.  Your support will make it happen!


Revolution Books is where people from around the world come for the books and the engagement about why the world is like this and how it could be radically transformed through revolution - there is a way out. It's a bookstore marked by a morality and strategic approach to fighting for a world that is overcoming all forms of exploitation and oppression… grounded in the re-envisioned communism of Bob Avakian, and with big arms to engage the wide spheres of cultural and intellectual life that must be a part of fighting for a new world.
The times are changing....There’s a new spirit of resistance spreading across the country - from Ferguson to Baltimore and beyond, and intensifying outrages from attacks on women’s rights, to a new escalation in Iraq, to one police murder after another.  Big questions are being posed about the future of humanity and the planet.  All this makes a vibrant and financially solvent Revolution Books more needed than ever.

$20,000 is needed now for this move and transformation.  Your donations will pay for: 


Installing a new floor
New electrical wiring and lighting

Patching and painting
An expanded stock and a Point of Sale system

The result:  a new and revitalized Revolution Books Berkeley...and a real contribution to human emancipation.

<p></p>
<h3>Who Are YOU???</h3>
<p>Why, we're Hyrrokkin, an instrumental avant-rock band from Yellow Springs, Ohio! Since forming in 2011, we've played all over the country. In the past, we did all of our traveling in the ""comfort"" of our big, bad, beautiful 1984 GMC full-size diesel van. We've taken this beast on several cross-country tours, we drove it to record our first LP at Seizures Palace in Brooklyn, we drove it on brief weekend forays, we drove it to record our collaboration with Merzbow up at Key Club Studios in Michigan, and we drove it to our mastering session at Chicago Mastering Service in (duh) Chicago. </p>
<p>This beast has history, It was once responsible for spiriting our previous band, Kuan, across the country, and it has carried our friends in the William Hooker Trio, Haitian Rail, and many more… </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Tell Me More About Your Van!</h3>
<p>We drove this van through the desert in the Summer, without A/C, when the temperatures were so high we couldn't even open the windows; we drove it through the snow, with diesel fumes and cold air seeping in through massive, rusted holes in the chassis. We spent countless nights sleeping in it, or next to it under the redwoods, or sometimes on top of it. One of us straight up lived in it for several months. We've spent hundreds of hours repairing, reworking, and tweaking things in the name of functionality… </p>
<p>Late last year, we drove the van out to Boston (incidentally, where we all met more than ten years ago), to play a great festival called the Boston Hassle Fest, with Horse Lords, Brandon Seabrook, Body/Head, and a bunch of other fantastic bands… Unfortunately, as we pulled into Boston, the transmission in our old friend started slipping… We had no choice but to leave our fallen friend behind.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Woah, That Sucks! What Now!?</h3>
<p>The time has come for us to replace our van, so we're launching this campaign, to play on your generosity, to harness your sympathies, so that you may choose to enable us to come rock you. </p>
<p>We're generally pretty thrifty humans, but this is a definite period of transition for our band. We're reeling from the loss of our van, and we'll also be losing our practice space, where we've been for almost 6 years, at the end of this month. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Maudlin Sentimentality Abounds!</h3>
<p>We're not looking for something brand new… We just need something serviceable, reliable, and with wheels, that we could drive to see our friends in faraway places like New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, and Boston… but more practically, something we can drive to gigs with friends in Dayton, Columbus, Louisville, and Cincinnati, for example. If they'll still have us, I mean. </p>
<p>Anything you can contribute would be a huge, huge help. It would basically keep us from selling our stuff to get back on top. Sure, maybe it is stuff we don't use, but you know… We have new music we're working on, and we're gearing up to hit the road for weekends in the very near future. Let's make this happen!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>So, Friend, What's In It For Me?</h3>
<p>We have a ton of stuff up for grabs… We want to reward you for supporting our quest to make tunes and burn up some tarmac… We have plenty of our own music available; special t-shirts and posters we'll be screening; dozens of badass releases from Ed's outstanding label, New Atlantis Records; more t-shirts; a personalized release of custom cover songs; personalized solo CDRs; live performances wherever you are; maybe a miserable tattoo from one of us; and more… </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Do You Want From Me, Stranger?</h3>
<p>We're shooting for $5,000, and if we don't make our goal, we will certainly make do.  That said, if we surpass $5,000, we will be able to put the resources towards soundproofing a small shed that we'll use as a practice space. It'll be nice!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>I'll Tell You What You Can Do With Your Crowdfunding...</h3>
<p>We do realize these fundraising campaigns get thrown around a lot…  Hopefully we are offering some interesting perks that will make this whole thing worthwhile. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We greatly appreciate your time, and we wish you all the best... We recognize that no one wants this stuck in their newsfeed every day, but this is going to run for 30 days. Then we're ghost! </span></p>
<p>If you can contribute... great! If not, no sweat, we will still love you for who you are.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Is This Campaign For, Again?</h3>
<p>Put some wheels underneath us so we can come be loud for you, and maybe put some insulation in our shed so we can not freeze and sculpt new tunes for you.</p>
<p>Please tell your friends, and your family members, and let's do this thang.</p>
<p>With grace, love and peace.</p>

Native grass... the beautiful old growth forest of the plains!</span></p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">I have been living a somewhat nomadic existence for 13 years now, mostly in the west of Canada, and my rides were a sort of culmination of this in-motion existence. During my rambles through the open plains, I found myself pondering the thought that it might soon be time to become a little more settled and I wondered if I might find such a place during the rides. A little place tucked in a Saskatchewan coulee perhaps; in the forests of the Porcupine Hills perhaps. </span></p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">It turns out that I did indeed find a place during that time. Interestingly and perhaps even strangely, that place is an old wood house nestled in the forest high up in the mountains to the east of Chiang Mai in northern Thailand. I find myself in full amazement of how a journey, travelled with an open heart, can take a person to unexpected – morphing to familiar – places. So here I sit now camped in my big cotton tent in the open prairies of SW Alberta, writing this after years of travelling, working towards being in one place, soon to be set up in a high tropical jungle. November 1, 2014 is the day that I make my move. My shift.</span></p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">This purpose of this คนตรีปา – Music Forest Indiegogo campaign is to help me set up a small instrument making and music composing/art studio. All funds raised will go towards getting my workshop set up and running and a beginning start on gathering the materials that I will need to get my studio to function as a self-sustaining entity for years to come. My plan is to sell the instruments that I make through the internet, word of mouth and via connections that I am presently establishing with instrument dealers in North America.</span></p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">Spending my days quietly making instruments is something that holds great appeal to me at this moment of my life, now in the later half of my 50's. The sense of peace and contentment that I find while building instruments is a wonderful thing. It is clearly where I must now go. Because the instruments that I make tend towards the unusual, I have found it impossible to fully do my work and survive here in Canada. And so, in part, it was from a financial aspect that pulled my thoughts towards the idea of setting up a home in rural Thailand. But then an almost magical thing happened. I discovered that I loved my time in Thailand; that I love Thailand and her people; that I felt more at home there after a few short months than I do in my home country; that the ways of the people I met in my daily life resonated with my own, in ways that I could never have expected; that to leave was wrenching in ways that I had not experienced before. To leave and to move has been the reality of my existence for a long time up to now. It is apparently time to now leave and to pause.</span></p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">I was initially drawn to Thailand a few years ago to help my mom, who now lives in Bangkok, to settle down there. Soon after arriving, I was loving my time in this intriguing nation and it wasn't long before the thought of living there myself presented itself. What I cannot possibly afford to do in Canada turns out to be quite feasible in rural Thailand. Though what I am trying to raise in this Indiegogo campaign is not a massive amount, it is for me, significant. The money that I raise is going to change my life in the most profound ways possible. The $2000 that I have set as my Indiegogo goal is what I will need to get a basic workshop going. </span>Enough to help me to live simply and to start creating my studio in that place where the air is thick with the sounds of insects in the evening. A small donation will go a long long way. All funds raised in excess of my goal will go towards bringing my studio to a more complete state, acquiring fine tools, a bank of wood and other materials for future instruments. I expect this move to be long term. </p><p>As I mentioned at the beginning, my full funding goal is to raise $10,000 before I leave to Thailand on November 1, 2014. As I write this I am already half way towards that $10,000 goal and just need a little help to get there. Enough to get me to Thailand; minimally set up with my studio and home and started with instrument making and allow me a year to get my name out there and a clientele together. In addition to this Indiegogo campaign, I am gathering funds working with horses - trimming, a bit of training - and doing other jobs as they come along in SW Alberta. Another amazingly beautiful part of the world.</p><p></p><h4>Where will your donation go?</h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space: pre;white-space:normal !important;""> </span>•<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space: pre;white-space:normal !important;""> </span>I have a big list of things to get together for the workshop. I will be purchasing some tools in Canada and some in Thailand. Money will go towards work benches, measuring devices, chisels, planes, saws, glues, clamps, drill bits, scrapers, building materials etc, having them delivered to my place as well as the need to get my work space to a functional state will include some minor house construction.

</div></div>","คนตรีปา – Music ForestA mountain workshop, a fine studio, a spirited home in the north of Thailand – An Indiegogo fundraising effort to help me get my new workshop up and running.Both a simple and natural next step and a marvellous new life adventure, I have begun a new path which is already starting to pack itself down and just needs a little boost from my friends! I am here to ask, 'Would you like to help me get there?'.The financial goal for this Indiegogo fundraising is $2000 and my full funding goal is $10,000. My name is Catherine Thompson and I am a Canadian musical instrument maker, musician, composer & visual artist. Between 2011 and 2012, for three spring/summer seasons, I traveled on my own by horseback for 2500 km meandering through the southern Canadian prairies linking together as much diminishing native grassland as possible. Native grass... the beautiful old growth forest of the plains!I have been living a somewhat nomadic existence for 13 years now, mostly in the west of Canada, and my rides were a sort of culmination of this in-motion existence. During my rambles through the open plains, I found myself pondering the thought that it might soon be time to become a little more settled and I wondered if I might find such a place during the rides. A little place tucked in a Saskatchewan coulee perhaps; in the forests of the Porcupine Hills perhaps. It turns out that I did indeed find a place during that time. Interestingly and perhaps even strangely, that place is an old wood house nestled in the forest high up in the mountains to the east of Chiang Mai in northern Thailand. I find myself in full amazement of how a journey, travelled with an open heart, can take a person to unexpected – morphing to familiar – places. So here I sit now camped in my big cotton tent in the open prairies of SW Alberta, writing this after years of travelling, working towards being in one place, soon to be set up in a high tropical jungle. November 1, 2014 is the day that I make my move. My shift.This purpose of this คนตรีปา – Music Forest Indiegogo campaign is to help me set up a small instrument making and music composing/art studio. All funds raised will go towards getting my workshop set up and running and a beginning start on gathering the materials that I will need to get my studio to function as a self-sustaining entity for years to come. My plan is to sell the instruments that I make through the internet, word of mouth and via connections that I am presently establishing with instrument dealers in North America.Spending my days quietly making instruments is something that holds great appeal to me at this moment of my life, now in the later half of my 50's. The sense of peace and contentment that I find while building instruments is a wonderful thing. It is clearly where I must now go. Because the instruments that I make tend towards the unusual, I have found it impossible to fully do my work and survive here in Canada. And so, in part, it was from a financial aspect that pulled my thoughts towards the idea of setting up a home in rural Thailand. But then an almost magical thing happened. I discovered that I loved my time in Thailand; that I love Thailand and her people; that I felt more at home there after a few short months than I do in my home country; that the ways of the people I met in my daily life resonated with my own, in ways that I could never have expected; that to leave was wrenching in ways that I had not experienced before. To leave and to move has been the reality of my existence for a long time up to now. It is apparently time to now leave and to pause.I was initially drawn to Thailand a few years ago to help my mom, who now lives in Bangkok, to settle down there. Soon after arriving, I was loving my time in this intriguing nation and it wasn't long before the thought of living there myself presented itself. What I cannot possibly afford to do in Canada turns out to be quite feasible in rural Thailand. Though what I am trying to raise in this Indiegogo campaign is not a massive amount, it is for me, significant. The money that I raise is going to change my life in the most profound ways possible. The $2000 that I have set as my Indiegogo goal is what I will need to get a basic workshop going. Enough to help me to live simply and to start creating my studio in that place where the air is thick with the sounds of insects in the evening. A small donation will go a long long way. All funds raised in excess of my goal will go towards bringing my studio to a more complete state, acquiring fine tools, a bank of wood and other materials for future instruments. I expect this move to be long term. As I mentioned at the beginning, my full funding goal is to raise $10,000 before I leave to Thailand on November 1, 2014. As I write this I am already half way towards that $10,000 goal and just need a little help to get there. Enough to get me to Thailand; minimally set up with my studio and home and started with instrument making and allow me a year to get my name out there and a clientele together. In addition to this Indiegogo campaign, I am gathering funds working with horses - trimming, a bit of training - and doing other jobs as they come along in SW Alberta. Another amazingly beautiful part of the world.Where will your donation go? • I have a big list of things to get together for the workshop. I will be purchasing some tools in Canada and some in Thailand. Money will go towards work benches, measuring devices, chisels, planes, saws, glues, clamps, drill bits, scrapers, building materials etc, having them delivered to my place as well as the need to get my work space to a functional state will include some minor house construction. In my work, I will be using hand tools for the most part but will likely purchase a couple of electrical ones too such as a power drill/drill press, a bandsaw and sander if funds allow. A major focus in my studio is that it can easily function with no electricity at all if need be. I much prefer the contemplative nature of hand-work to the noise of machines but one or three electrical tools does make life a little easier at times.Perks • The Sun & The Wind USB Flash-Art Stick perk is a collection of audio and video files, images from my three years of long rides and a 43 page pdf of some of the writings that came out my grassland rambles all placed on a 4GB USB flash drive that you can access with your computer packaged with a lovely signed thank you card with a photo from the ride.
 • I will have one Tsugaru Shamisen, two Gourdudus and one Kora available and ready to be shipped.         •  I have an Igil (my own version of a Tuvan horsehead fiddle) made with a gourd, bloodwood, a deerskin sounding surface, horse hair strings and a lovely bow made from Bloodwood, deer antler and horsehair from the tail of my beautiful horse Dakota (now in a lovely new home!). • The other instrument perks are 6 of each of the Kora and Shamisen due one year after the end of the campaign.

>>>>> Notre histoire <<<<<
Futsu est une carte postale du triangle des Bermudes…un éclat pop rock brut qui vous emporte dans un voyage hypnotique, romantique et aventureux. 
Né des cendres du projet solo acoustique de Mike Marques, compositeur multi-instrumentiste australien, le groupe renaît sous sa forme Indie rock/Freak pop en 2014. Composé de six personnalités musicales contrastées, la formation évolue dans un univers frais et décalé fait de mélodies entêtantes et de rythmes percutants.

La concrétisation de 'Body Island,' passé d'un rêve fou à la réalité donne au groupe un élan fantastique. La sortie de ce premier opus pop-acoustique, constitué  d'une collection de titres composés sur une période de trois ans, dont la moitié est financée par son public sur cette même plateforme à 110% en 2013, encourage Mike à poursuivre l'écriture et à jouer régulièrement en live avec son nouveau line-up. Le groupe se produit alors dans divers espaces culturels ainsi qu'au Bus Palladium et au Comedy Club et compose de nouveaux titres marquant une vraie évolution dans le son : Le prochain Futsu sera un electro-shock !!!






>>>>>Notre but <<<<<

Oui mais pourquoi ?Aujourd'hui, le groupe est dans une démarche différente et ne veut pas attendre pour partager son nouveau son avec vous : les morceaux choisis, fruits d'expérimentations electro-rock de ces six derniers mois ont été ""roadtesté"" en live, prémaquettés en résidence et n'attendent qu'une seule chose : prendre forme sur ce que constituera un nouvel E.P explosif.

Du petit caillou au gros rocher peu importe : Chaque grain de sable a son importance lorsqu'on investi dans la musique en laquelle on croit !Si 'Body Island' a contribué à développer plus encore sa relation avec son public, le prochain E.P permettra au groupe de consolider la relation amorcée avec les professionnels.

We started as a jam band in the summer of 2012 and have since grown into a full blown musical force with a horn section 4 members deep. 

For the past 8 months we have been recording our first album at Speak Studios. Hundreds of hours of composing and practicing, and many long days of recording and mixing have produced an album that we are proud of and want to share with the world.  
Here's where you come in - we need your help funding the publication of our album. Many of us are fresh out of college (Burlie is still there) and don't have much expendable income. We've managed to cover the costs of recording and production. This campaign is crucial to our ability to provide CDs and other tangible merchandise to our fans.
What's in it for you?
If you contribute $10 or more then you have purchased a copy of our album. You can think of it as a presale purchase. We are also offering signed merchandise at higher contribution tiers. See the ""Perks"" at the right for details. 
Not only does your contribution help us publish our first album, it also kickstarts our musical future. Help us spread the joy of feel good funk for many years to come. 




We really appreciate your contributions to CHUNK! Thank you so much for helping us out.

<h2>Uncle Riffkin -<i> band of teachers</i>
</h2>
<p>If you don't know us already, our story began 5 years ago at a school in San Francisco where 4 of us met as teachers and co-workers. Over the course of several years we realized that we were all musicians looking to perform and write music. As we began rehearsing and writing in Mike's garage, things started to develop and we began performing as Uncle Riffkin, which led to our first recording effort that we did entirely in our school's sound booth. In the last two years we have added a bassist and developed our sound, writing dozens of songs in the process. In that time we have also played gigs around San Francisco, the Bay Area, Northern California, Oregon and Michigan and hope to continue our passion for many years ahead. Did we mention that 4 out of 5 of us are working teachers as well? Yes, it's true, we find time in our busy schedules to make this band a priority, and we have a lot of fun in the process. We are inspired, dedicated, and want to share more with our growing audience!</p>
<p>However, for our band and audience to grow we need more than our humble recording equipment and we want to get the best sound possible. To do this, we are asking for financial assistance in booking studio time, hiring a sound engineer, and creating a professionally produced album that we can share with our audience. We are already beginning our recording January 14th &amp; 15th at Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco, and are confident they will give us the best possible product in the end. However, this will not be enough to complete our goal. That's where we need you! To help us cover the costs of studio time, mixing, producing, album creation, and CD release. We need your help!</p>
<p>We are grateful for any contribution you can make. Did we mention that we're teachers? Our funds are limited but we're passionate about what we do and excited for the opportunity that recording this album will present, and with your help we can make it happen! Thank you so much and keep listening, as more is to come...</p>

The music lineup for Saturday includes Wendy Woo, Angie Stevens, Megan Burtt, Paper Bird and several others who are yet to be announced. Along with incredible bands we will have a seed sale and swap to kick off the Colorado growing season, yoga, foraging walks, farm tours, live farm demonstrations and incredible vendors selling their beautiful artwork and sharing more information on ways to get involved supporting women farmers everywhere.<br/><br/>1% For Women is excited to combine their knowledge of helping women around the world, and running large scale events with that of the Farmers Femme. The Farmers Femme is an organization of women farmers and ranchers from around Central Colorado. They bring first hand experience to share with existing and budding agriculturalists.<br/><br/>These two organizations are coming together to bring awareness to the importance of supporting women in agriculture, through music and celebration!<br/><br/>When women earn a steady income 80 - 90% of this money is spent on nutrition, housing and education for their families.

</div> <div> <h3>Why We Need Your Help!</h3>
<p>There are many costs involved with bringing  a music festival to life. 1% For Women is using our own resources to cover whatever isn't raised toward the overhead of the event. While we make this commitment out of our deep desire to raise awareness, we also know that whatever money we use toward the festival ultimately limits the dollar amount we are able to put to funding loans as an organization. While both the loans and the educational component are equally important to us, we greatly appreciate any donation you can make to help us cover these costs. Anything raised above and beyond the festival costs will go directly toward microcredit loans for women around the world.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Where Do Your Donations Go?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Your contribution will go directly to funding the festival. The first round of money raised will pay for the musical talent at the festival. If we reach this goal we will look for additional assistance for the sound, staging and all of the logistics involved in bringing the festival to life. <br/></p>
<p>The proceeds from the festival will be spent on ensuring the festival happens again in 2016 and to funding microcredit loans for women in agriculture around the world through 1% For Women.</p>
<p><i><b>That means that the more money we raise toward overhead, the more money we have available for the loans that will uplift and empower women and create healthier communities.</b></i></p>

</p>
<p><a href=""www.OnePercentForWomen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1% For Women</a> takes great pride in funding microcredit
loans for women around the world.</p>
<p>We frequently get asked why we are only loaning to women when
there are men and boys that are in equal need of support. Here is our brief
answer to that question.</p>
<p>Economically empowering women and girls will help decrease
poverty through the generations.</p>
<p>For every dollar a woman earns, she invests .80 to .90 cents into
her family, compared to .30 cents by men.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that when women earn a steady income, the
money is more likely to be spent on nutrition, medicine and housing moving
toward healthier, better educated children.</p>
<p>These children are then capable of making a positive impact
in their local and greater communities. Investing in mothers is an investment
in their families. Investing in children is an investment in the future of
humanity and our planet.</p>
<p>By investing in women, we are taking great strides toward
alleviating the poverty and oppression that still impacts so many today.</p>
<p>Microcredit is an incredible way to both empower and uplift
women around the world.</p>
<p>By partnering with the Farmers Femme, we increase the local impact from the festival as well. Educating others on the importance of supporting women who are nurturing the land is crucial.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Starting a new festival takes time and considerable planning. Laurie Benson, the founder of 1% For Women started the Collegiate Peaks Music Festival in 2006 and ran the event for 5 years. She took the festival from a vision to a thriving event that pulled thousands of people to Buena Vista, CO every year. She is no stranger to the trials and tribulations of large events.<br/><br/>The greatest challenge is going to be spreading the word. People will flock to a festival in the mountains where they can dance the day away in the sunshine, we just need to let them all know it is happening.<br/><br/>Our greatest risk is taking on the incredible expense associated with the festival. The less money we raise through this campaign, the less money we are able to put directly toward microcredit loans.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We understand that some people simply don't have the ability to financially contribute, here are some other ways to help:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Make some noise!! Help us spread the word by inviting your friends on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/800537286675895/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook</a><br/>

</div></div>","Music, Celebration, Microcredit and More!

WE ARE INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE WILL BE PROVIDING 2 
SCHOLARSHIPS FOR POTENTIAL WOMEN FARMERS AT THE MUSIC FESTIVAL!Plain and simple we are using music and celebration to empower women farmers and fund microcredit loans for women around the world. Come join us!While stories of chemical ridden pesticides and GMOs fill the headlines,
 putting your support in the right places can begin the change we all 
need to not only create a sustainable future, but a thriving one!1% For Women and the Farmers Femme have come together to create a music festival celebrating Women in Agriculture.On June 5th and 6th in Buena Vista, CO, thousands will gather to listen to incredible music, dance in the mountains and show their support of women around the world whose work is healing their families, their communities and the environment.Help us bring this festival to life by raising the $18,000 needed to pay the incredible bands that will play all weekend.The festival will include a farm to table dinner with a private concert on Friday night and then jump into the larger celebration on Saturday. The music lineup for Saturday includes Wendy Woo, Angie Stevens, Megan Burtt, Paper Bird and several others who are yet to be announced. Along with incredible bands we will have a seed sale and swap to kick off the Colorado growing season, yoga, foraging walks, farm tours, live farm demonstrations and incredible vendors selling their beautiful artwork and sharing more information on ways to get involved supporting women farmers everywhere.1% For Women is excited to combine their knowledge of helping women around the world, and running large scale events with that of the Farmers Femme. The Farmers Femme is an organization of women farmers and ranchers from around Central Colorado. They bring first hand experience to share with existing and budding agriculturalists.These two organizations are coming together to bring awareness to the importance of supporting women in agriculture, through music and celebration!When women earn a steady income 80 - 90% of this money is spent on nutrition, housing and education for their families. These women are raising happier, healthier children who have the skills to change the future for the betterment of humanity.1% For Women works with businesses who commit 1% of their net profits to
 microcredit loans for women around the world. Through their partnership with Kiva.org they 
have funded loans in 7 countries, creating ripples that are breaking the
 cycles of oppression and poverty that still affect so many.See more at www.OnePercentForWomen.comSupporting this festival equates to empowering women farmers in the US and helping fund these microcredit loans to women in agriculture around the world.Through a weekend of music, dancing and celebration we will all actively participate in creating healthier global communities and a healthier planet.So, take a look at our incredible perks and come join us for the Sweet Roots Festival on Friday, June 5th and Saturday, June 6, 2015 in Buena Vista, CO.
  Why We Need Your Help!
There are many costs involved with bringing  a music festival to life. 1% For Women is using our own resources to cover whatever isn't raised toward the overhead of the event. While we make this commitment out of our deep desire to raise awareness, we also know that whatever money we use toward the festival ultimately limits the dollar amount we are able to put to funding loans as an organization. While both the loans and the educational component are equally important to us, we greatly appreciate any donation you can make to help us cover these costs. Anything raised above and beyond the festival costs will go directly toward microcredit loans for women around the world.

Where Do Your Donations Go?

Your contribution will go directly to funding the festival. The first round of money raised will pay for the musical talent at the festival. If we reach this goal we will look for additional assistance for the sound, staging and all of the logistics involved in bringing the festival to life. 
The proceeds from the festival will be spent on ensuring the festival happens again in 2016 and to funding microcredit loans for women in agriculture around the world through 1% For Women.
That means that the more money we raise toward overhead, the more money we have available for the loans that will uplift and empower women and create healthier communities.



Help Us By Selecting A Perk!




So, here is what we have for you! Our perks include tickets to the event, tickets to the Farm to Table dinner, t-shirts and much more.
Pick your perk and we will happily send them along to you! The t-shirt and bumper sticker designs are mock-ups and may change a bit before they go to print. We promise that they will look great!
Bumper Stickers


T-Shirts


Farm to Table Dinner
Music Festival Tickets
Or Become A Sponsor!
Another option is to have your business, organization, family, whomever become a sponsor for the festival and be featured in all of our marketing and promotions.


Why Women? What Difference Will it Make?




1% For Women takes great pride in funding microcredit
loans for women around the world.
We frequently get asked why we are only loaning to women when
there are men and boys that are in equal need of support. Here is our brief
answer to that question.
Economically empowering women and girls will help decrease
poverty through the generations.
For every dollar a woman earns, she invests .80 to .90 cents into
her family, compared to .30 cents by men.
Studies have shown that when women earn a steady income, the
money is more likely to be spent on nutrition, medicine and housing moving
toward healthier, better educated children.
These children are then capable of making a positive impact
in their local and greater communities. Investing in mothers is an investment
in their families. Investing in children is an investment in the future of
humanity and our planet.
By investing in women, we are taking great strides toward
alleviating the poverty and oppression that still impacts so many today.
Microcredit is an incredible way to both empower and uplift
women around the world.
By partnering with the Farmers Femme, we increase the local impact from the festival as well. Educating others on the importance of supporting women who are nurturing the land is crucial.
  Risks & ChallengesStarting a new festival takes time and considerable planning. Laurie Benson, the founder of 1% For Women started the Collegiate Peaks Music Festival in 2006 and ran the event for 5 years. She took the festival from a vision to a thriving event that pulled thousands of people to Buena Vista, CO every year. She is no stranger to the trials and tribulations of large events.The greatest challenge is going to be spreading the word. People will flock to a festival in the mountains where they can dance the day away in the sunshine, we just need to let them all know it is happening.Our greatest risk is taking on the incredible expense associated with the festival. The less money we raise through this campaign, the less money we are able to put directly toward microcredit loans.
  Other Ways You Can Help We understand that some people simply don't have the ability to financially contribute, here are some other ways to help: 
Make some noise!! Help us spread the word by inviting your friends on facebook
 Use the Indiegogo share tools!


The Lineup!These musicians will be a part of the festivities. Right now we are happy to announce the following bands as part of the festival: Angie Stevens, Wendy Woo, Megan Burtt and headlining the weekend is Paper Bird! We will add more as we hear back from other talented artists. Stay tuned!

For me it has been one of the most connected experiences with our planet I've had.To be able to give this experience to the youth in my community that may never get the chance is almost overwhelming. It's my hope with this campaign and benefit in honour of J.E.S.S. 4 KIDS that we give this kids an opportunity to get out in the wild, explore the hills, and find out something about themselves.Maybe you can't contribute, but that's not to say you can't help in different ways. Simple donations outside of this campaign are more than welcomed, and I would be just as grateful if you shared this campaign with your friends anywhere and everywhere to help get the word out, even if it is just your family. This is a cause worth knowing, and at the end of the day, it's about our community, growing together and helping each other, no matte the cost.windmills keep moving.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>What are we doing here?</h3>
<p>Hey, I’m Maya, an independent singer and composer from Jerusalem, and I’m asking for your help funding my debut album.</p> <p>My album-to-be includes 10 original compositions of poems by three female Hebrew poets - Lea Goldberg, Rachel Shapira and Arianna Haran - each from a different period in the short Israeli history, each leading in her time, each dealing with issues of femininity and masculinity within the Israeli-Jewish society, from both a personal and a sociological perspective. Each of these women tell a different story. Together, they provide a unique and touching perspective to the lives of Israeli women and the Israeli life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>This project started years ago, when I was studying in Jerusalem Music Academy. As a female musician who was always interested in poetry, it almost seemed inevitable. It began as a one-time project, and grew into much more.</p>
<p>Back then I’ve started this work on my own, and eventually it became a joint project of myself and six other musicians, all of whom good friends of mine, coming from different musical backgrounds, and bringing their own personal angles to the music. We’ve performed with this project dozens of times, each time perfecting it, along with the help of my ensemble.</p> <p>And finally, we are producing an album. With myself as the lead singer, guitar by Ronnie Wagner, bass by Shay Hazan, violin by Tomer Einat, drums by Oded Levi, flute by Hagai Ashdot and Yaron Eigenstein on the accordion and produced by one of the leading producers in the Israeli music industry, Zach Drori, we are hoping to turn this years-long project into a professionally produced album, combining each of the musicians’ attitudes - from classical, through jazz, Irish folk music, oriental music and all the way to funk music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Who am I?</span></h3>
<p>A bit about myself: I’m Maya, 30 years old and living in Jerusalem with my husband and his three children. Music has been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>I grew up with my parents and three brothers in a small village in the Western Galilee. My family and I used to travel as often as we could, whether within Israel and abroad. In these trips I’ve learned a lot on how to listen. Listening to voices coming from different people and different cultures, I have developed my own voice, inspired by all of them and individual nonetheless. From early childhood I’ve had classical musical education, a journey I’ve continued in the Music academy in Jerusalem.</p> <p>I’ve been living in Jerusalem for almost a third of my life. I am in love with this beautiful, diverse and difficult city, which is like a living being of the fabric of humanity itself. This diversity is always present in my music, and in my life approach.</p> <p>These days I am conducting choirs for children with special needs and managing the leading Israeli chamber choir, of Jerusalem Music Academy and teaching vocal pedagogy. And, of course, trying to produce an album.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How can you help?</h3>
<p>Now, I need you to make this dream come true. Every donation counts, really. If you cannot donate, you can help tremendously just by sharing this project, or forwarding it to your friends.</p>
<p>I thank you dearly for being here. Hopefully, together we can make something amazing.</p>

<p>The members of Boxing Day are: Ogden Basye, who sings, plays guitar and writes the songs; Olorin Jaillet, who plays the drums; and Carson Nitta, who plays the bass. Together we make loud melodic power pop, inspired by an eclectic mix of rock bands such as Pavement, Big Star, Rush, and The Police. We recently released our debut single ""Groupie"", which you can hear—and watch—above.</p>
<p>With our debut EP, Boxing Day's goal is to create a product of an incredibly high caliber. However, recording and performing at this high level of quality is a very expensive process. As we released our debut single less than two months ago, we have not yet developed a large fanbase or amassed enough money from music streaming and sales to feasibly finance the project ourselves. We play shows often, and though we get a fair amount of gigs with impressive attendance rates, the amount of money we actually get—as a young band who are new to the business—is currently negligible. And that's where you come in.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Our EP will include five original compositions, including ""Groupie"". We plan to record them with <a href=""http://www.ajampdx.com/alanjonesabout"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alan Jones</a>, who also produced our debut single. The project will then be mixed and mastered by <a href=""http://www.bobstarksound.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bob Stark</a>. If you donate to our project, you can preorder a digital copy of the EP with liner notes that are not available with the iTunes download. We also have T-shirts with our customized logo, and an option to appear in our next video!</p>
<p>One of our goals as a band is to inspire more teen artists to commit to music as a professional career. The members of Boxing Day are extremely committed to their craft, with incredible ambition and a work ethic to match. We hope that any success we have will inspire and motivate other artistically inclined teenagers. We encourage you to contact us if you know of an opportunity to perform at a school or an event pertaining to the musical education of youth!</p>
<p>You can support us by coming to our shows, and following us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Email us at gitfiddlemusic@gmail.com and we will add you to our newsletter where you can be notified of upcoming Boxing Day-related events!</p>

My heart's desire is that this record of 11 songs will release hope, joy and faith that will shift atmospheres and change lives.</div>

<p>In this culture, videos open doors for more music. When we apply to perform at festivals and high profile venues, the first thing they want is a live music video to get the truest sense of our performance.

Our projected cost to bring you a high-quality live recording and companion video is $2,500, and we have a special perk for every giving level. Giving to this project will help us achieve our music dreams, and every contribution will be deeply meaningful to us.</p>
<h3>About the Music</h3>
<p>Chasing Ebenezer has a storehouse of music waiting to be recorded, as well as new songs in the works that we want you to hear. We chose to record ""Say"" because its folk-rock vibe is full of energy. We think you'll enjoy blasting it in your car.</p>

If all our regular followers pitched in a few bucks, that would finance this project. So that's what we're doing. Not demanding, but humbly asking if you'll help us continue to create.

<h3>My Story!</h3>
<p>I've been singing for as long as I can remember. Music has always been my greatest passion and a light in the darkest times of my life. Songwriting began for me in 2009, when I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease. I spent all of a year in and out of the hospital, and wasn't well enough to leave my home. I began writing music as a distraction and a way to process my emotions, and I've continued ever since. In 2014, I was lucky enough to meet two incredible musicians on the app Vine, and we formed the band Dear Ears. Since then, we have released one album, four music videos, and began working on a second album for this coming year. I am so fortunate for the experience this band has given and continues to give me—Without it, I wouldn't have the skills or the courage to release anything on my own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Which brings us to my current goal! I have always dreamed of recording a solo album, but I lacked the experience, the knowledge, and the confidence to go out on a limb by myself. I wanted to be sure that I knew my own sound so that I could create something that felt like an extension of myself. My love of folk music undoubtably stems from my southern upbringing, and I wanted to combine that with other genres I find myself drawn to: Americana, psychedelia, blues, etc. Through researching, writing, and losing sleep, I was able to uncover the artist I want to be.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So now, I'm ready. I am going to achieve this dream, and I cannot thank you enough for supporting me along the way.</p>

<h3><strong>ABOUT THE ALBUM</strong></h3>

<p><i><strong>Patterns </strong></i>is the result of my exploration into songwriting.  While the themes in my music are all extremely personal, I believe a lot of them are universal. I’m writing about what it’s like to be a young person in today’s world. I’m 26, addicted to my phone and social media while living in the midst of a pandemic. It’s easy to feel anxious and depressed. I know I’m not the only one going through this. I hope my songs can provide some sort of solace for people that feel the same way. People need to know that it's okay and that we will get through this. </p>
<h3><b>HOW WILL YOUR CONTRIBUTION HELP ME? </b></h3>
<p>Your contribution will: </p>
<p><strong>1 - Help me to finish recording my debut album, Patterns.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 - Help me to release it world-wide with an impactful, realistic marketing campaign.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3 - Launch the career of a proud Canadian artist on to the international stage.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>My funding goal is broken down in to five steps. Each step builds upon the previous one and has been strategically selected by my management team. Together (and on their own) these steps will create the most impactful release campaign within the given budget.  </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>When you contribute any amount to my campaign you become part of a community that believes in supporting independent creators.  You'll be added to my Indiegogo mailing list and receive regular updates, including the same marketing plan that my team and I use. You'll receive behind the scenes video footage and regular updates from the road.  You also get a cool perk :) </p>
<h3><strong>PERKS - HOW THEY WORK</strong></h3>
<p>1. You buy a perk.</p>
<p>2. Your money is deposited in to my Indiegogo account.</p>
<p>3.<strong> </strong>My team and I use this money to fund each marketing initiative (aka each step).  </p>
<p>There is a perk for all budgets. For $5 you can pre-stream my singles <i>Patterns</i> or <i>Leaf Syndrome</i> (a full two months ahead of release). For $20 you can pre-order the Patterns album + pre-stream the <i>Patterns single. </i>For $250 you can throw a livestream party with me as your personal DJ.  Perks also make a great gift for family and friends. No matter the size or cost of the perk every dollar will be put to good use.</p>

I’m writing about what it’s like to be a young person in today’s world. I’m 26, addicted to my phone and social media while living in the midst of a pandemic. It’s easy to feel anxious and depressed. I know I’m not the only one going through this. I hope my songs can provide some sort of solace for people that feel the same way. People need to know that it's okay and that we will get through this. 
HOW WILL YOUR CONTRIBUTION HELP ME? 
Your contribution will: 
1 - Help me to finish recording my debut album, Patterns.
2 - Help me to release it world-wide with an impactful, realistic marketing campaign.
3 - Launch the career of a proud Canadian artist on to the international stage.

What I Need
My funding goal is broken down in to five steps. Each step builds upon the previous one and has been strategically selected by my management team. Together (and on their own) these steps will create the most impactful release campaign within the given budget.  
What You Get
When you contribute any amount to my campaign you become part of a community that believes in supporting independent creators.  You'll be added to my Indiegogo mailing list and receive regular updates, including the same marketing plan that my team and I use. You'll receive behind the scenes video footage and regular updates from the road.  You also get a cool perk :) 
PERKS - HOW THEY WORK
1. You buy a perk.
2. Your money is deposited in to my Indiegogo account.
3. My team and I use this money to fund each marketing initiative (aka each step).  
There is a perk for all budgets. For $5 you can pre-stream my singles Patterns or Leaf Syndrome (a full two months ahead of release). For $20 you can pre-order the Patterns album + pre-stream the Patterns single. For $250 you can throw a livestream party with me as your personal DJ.  Perks also make a great gift for family and friends. No matter the size or cost of the perk every dollar will be put to good use.
Your Perk Will Help To Fund The Following: 
 
STEP 1: ART DIRECTION & PHOTOGRAPHY
Artwork - Akiko Nakayama 

Art Direction for the campaign features original work by Akiko Nakayama.  Akiko is quickly becoming one of Japan's most acclaimed visual artists. She has agreed to create a series of original pieces to be used across the Patterns campaign. This includes artwork for three singles, the album and two music videos. 
 
Photography - Trevor Brady 


Acclaimed fashion photographer Trevor Brady will shoot the stills for the campaign. His work has been featured in Cosmo, Dazed, Glamour, Harper's Bazaar,  ID, Interview, Nylon, Vanity Fair, Vice, Vogue and Wallpaper.  Celebrity clients include Tegan & Sara, Lily Allen, Brad Wilk, Tiera Skovbye, Lights and more. I hope to never release an album without him.  Both Akiko and Trevor have offered their services for well below their day rates. I'm forever grateful for their generosity and support. 

COST: $2,500 
 
STEP 2:  COLLEGE RADIO 


College Radio is the building block of any successful indie artist. It's where many alternative artists first find national exposure.  I'm thrilled that Frontside Promotion has agreed to champion my debut album at college radio across the US/Canada.  Geoff and his team  choose to only work with artists that they feel have a legitimate chance of finding college support. Sadly, this is not the industry standard.  James Blake, Finneas, Flume and Grimes are just some of the acts that Frontside works with.  I could not ask for a more credible introduction to the tastemakers at college radio. 
COLLEGE RADIO SCHEDULE 
April 23, 2021 - Patterns + Leaf Syndrome 
June 11th, 2021 -  Patterns full album 
COST (Phase 1/2): $3,500
 
STEP 3: MUSIC VIDEO x 2


 


 
A compelling music video can help propel a song to new heights and this is the plan with the videos for Shift and Patterns. Both will feature the ""Alive Painting"" technique perfected by Akiko Nakayama.
The video for Shift,  (the album's only non-vocal track) will feature a magical, pulsating performance of paint, light and sound. The Patterns video will feature footage of myself set within Akiko's visual world and will blur the boundaries between art and performance.  The top image was taken during a proof of concept test. 
The videos will be delivered to YouTube, VEVO, TIDAL, Apple Music and Facebook by Symphonic Distribution.  My management team will focus on promoting the video to music websites, blogs and journalists.  They will also look to partner with a media partner for the exclusive premiere of each video. 
Shift video: April 23rd, 2021 
Patterns video: June 18th, 2021
COST: $3,500
 
STEP 4: DIGITAL CONTENT 

Funding for this step will go toward the creation of original shot short form video content. The talented team at Sybuk Media (producers of my Indiegogo video) will create a total of ten short-form (:15 - :60 sec) videos.  These will be used to drive awareness around each single release and to create a deeper visual world for the album.  They will be multi-purposed for use across social media, streaming + video partners, newsletters, press and college radio. 
COST: $2,800
 
STEP 5: DIGITAL MARKETING 

Found.ee is used by the likes of St.Vincent, Flying Lotus, Zola Jesus, Denzel Curry and most record labels.  It's a powerful, clever and budget friendly music marketing platform which my team will get my music/videos in front of the right people at the right time (those in search of music ie. who opt in)  The majority of funding for this step will pay for the purchase and placement of ""Streaming Banner Ads"" on highly influential music blogs including Pitchfork, Rolling Stone and NME.
COST: $2,500
 
MY TOTAL FUNDING GOAL:
$16,500 CAD 
 

EXECUTION - MY TEAM

To quote Steve Jobs, ""Ideas are worth nothing unless executed"".  My funding campaign will be executed by the very capable team at Block Sound Mgmt headed by my manager, Daniel Cutler, co-founder of Arts & Crafts.  Daniel has helped launch the careers of indie rock royalty (Broken Social Scene, Feist, Stars) and has led major label marketing campaigns for the likes of Daft Punk, Chemical Brothers and David Bowie.  On the distribution front, the incredible team at Symphonic will handle my digital distribution and will pitch my songs/videos directly to Spotify, Apple and other major digital release partners.  Symphonic has offices in NYC, Denver, Nashville, Tampa Bay, Sao Paulo and Bogota. 

Risks & Challenges
There's no denying the music industry is full of risk. Music, like most art, is a purely speculative endeavour and there's no shortage of talented artists vying for your attention.  As uphill as this sounds, I find hope in a piece of advice my brother Tom once gave me: “Focus on the music and everything else will fall into place.”  

Last but not least! If you're not able to make a financial contribution, you can still help by sharing this campaign on social media such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter. You can use the handy Indiegogo share tools available on the top of this page.
Thank-you for your support, it means the world to me :)",10.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>For the last two years the <strong>Naomi Ashley Band</strong> has been playing <strong>Last Wednesdays at Wire</strong>, a monthly residency in the intimate front bar at Wire in Berwyn, IL. It has become the highlight of my month, every month. At some point along the way Last Wednesdays turned into a way for band &amp; audience to connect, laugh and partake in the soul-restoring power of music. I have always wished there was a way to bottle up the experience of those Wednesdays that I could share or just take out when I needed a lift. I think this live record is the next best thing.</p>
<p><strong>LAST WEDNESDAYS LIVE</strong> is a lovingly produced selection of some our favorite originals &amp; covers recorded at our Last Wednesday residency at over the course of 2018. Recorded by Michael Krayniak, mixed by Jon Smith, Retro Room, mastered by Blaise Barton, Joyride Studios with cover design by Cathie Van Wert. This great sounding record is a celebration of our collaboration with each other, the venue and our Last Wednesday audience. A gift for us that we can share with all of you!</p>
<p>We are doing a <strong>LIMITED RUN of CD’s</strong>, so the best way to ensure a copy is to <strong>PRE-ORDER</strong>. All pre-orders receive a download of an <strong>*Exclusive Bonus Track*</strong> not available on the record and <strong>free shipping within the USA!</strong></p>

Außerdem bin ich tausende von Kilometern gereist. In spring 2018, the path that has taken me from western Canada to southern Spain, will bring me to northern Germany to one of the world’s most exciting harbour cities; Hamburg!

Zwei Monate später, am 1. Mai, werde ich dann ein Album mit zehn Liedern und ein 75 Seiten starkes Album-Booklet veröffentlichen - mein bisher umfangreichstes Buch!  From the ten songs that are voted to make the new album’s tracklist, I will choose one song that will be made into a feature video that will be shot and produced in Hamburg by an independent film maker, and released to my YouTube channel on June 1st. Aus den 10 von Dir gewählten Songs, werde ich ein Lied auswählen, zu dem ein Video entstehen wird.

Bryan and I will start crafting the arrangements for each of the songs that will go on the album.

My name is Mary McAvoy, and I'm a singer-songwriter here in the beautiful city of Boston, Massachusetts.I’ve been making music and performing around New England for the last several years:  pop arrangements on college campuses with my UNH A Capella group, classic rock, Motown and Top 40's songs at weddings, acoustic covers at local bars and sunset cruises, intimate acoustic jams in backyards and basements and original tunes at my release shows around Boston. After pouring everything I’ve learned into songwriting, into stories, into harmony, the only thing left is to share the new sounds in my head and my heart with all of you.The material is ready, the musicians are waiting--this Indiegogo campaign is the final step toward creating my first-ever professionally produced studio album.This campaign is raising funds for my professionally recorded album with Bryan Fennelly, a Boston-based producer, and engineer working with both established and up-and-coming musicians. Together, Bryan and I are digging into my original material, writing arrangements, and reaching out to local musicians to bring the songs to life.We’ve been able to cover the costs of recording and producing one song, which is ready for you to check out right here on this page. This first song is called “Real,” and you can check it out below! While we were able to fund the recording process for ""Real"" on my own, to create an album of songs of this quality, studio time costs add up quickly. With that said, this campaign can give us a unique opportunity to collaborate and make great art together. Your donation will cover following costs of my project:1. Pre-Production: This is where everything starts. Bryan and I will start crafting the arrangements for each of the songs that will go on the album. We’ll hold rehearsals to fine-tune the songs, arrangements, and talk through new and exciting ideas for how to approach the recording process.2. Recording: This is when we enter the studio and start capturing the music and where the songs become what you'll hear on this album. This campaign will play a huge role in making sure we have enough time to capture great performances for every member of the band.3. Mixing & Mastering: Each track will get mixed to create the right balance between instruments, texture and color that make up a track. As a final step, the album will be mastered from beginning to end, so the listening experience is cohesive and carefully choreographed from start to finish.And what will you get for your generosity and support?

<h3>MORF! When's your new music out?</h3>
<p>Glad you asked, random person who I definitely didn't make up to ask that question!..</p>
<p>After the success of 2017s album featuring 'Driving Fast' I've decided it's time to make a new album, but not only make a new album; make it the best dam album I've ever made</p>
<p>To do this I am moving away from my home studio and moving into France's biggest entertainment production complex, hosted by a personal friend and his world-leading producer. This promises the best highest quality sound and high level production to really make this album shine. </p>
<p>Coupled with that, given its a fully fledged entertainment complex; we will also be making cinematic quality music videos for all the tracks. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's dam expensive. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I need help with</h3>
<p>Well, as most of us know, the world is in a bit of a situation right now.</p>
<p>I had budgeted and prepared for this album, but what I needed to happen was street performances to be a possibility, and all the bookings I had lined up to go ahead.</p>
<p>Things happen; and the new outbreak of Covid19 has effectively cancelled all my bookings, and is now preventing us from forming crowds in public spaces; meaning busking is out.</p>
<p>This effectively means I cannot make any money, which means I cannot record this album.</p>
<p>Thats where you come in. You, the people. Those who want to hear my new music, and support my efforts as a humble unsigned musical troubadour </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>I will be including a variety of 'perks' in this campaign. Perks are essentially things I will send you if you support a particular level of the funding process.</p>
<p>The standard perk will obviously be the signed CD upon final production; sent to your home with a big sloppy kiss (ok none of that, that won't help the virus spread...!) or a thank you message from myself and I. </p>
<p>But there will also be other perks available, like credits, videos, and even guitars.</p>
<p>Check the side panel for details when you pledge :) </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk right now is financial position. </p>
<p>Because I want this album to be amazing, not just good, I've decided to go to a world class production suite. This means the album will sound as good as any major album you spin on your Spotify playlists on the daily. But it also means I will be able to work alongside professional producers who can help me get the best sound and structure out of my work; making it more enjoyable for everybody. </p>
<p>We will also be shooting music videos :)</p>
<p>This comes at a cost; a very high cost. And along with the material costs of producing the CDs, having in guest musicians, etc, the financial burden of this project is the largest challenge right now. Especially when im unable to perform to make the £££ to fund it.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't want a CD or any perk; you can always pledge a small amount to support the fundraiser. Even £1 goes a long way when many people donate it.</p>
<p>You can share this fundraiser, along with some videos of my performances, if you really enjoy what I do and think the world should see and hear it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2020 was going to be the year I work my hardest to get music to the whole world, and whilst there's been a big nail in the works thanks to this pandemic, I still want that to happen. So with your help, it can happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>COST BREAKDOWN OF PROJECT:</strong></p>
<p><strong>7500 total</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recording - Studio France </strong>: 3500</p>
<p><strong>​Mixing/ Mastering - </strong>1000</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">❤️ HELLO, EVERYONE! I'M RECORDING A VALENTINE'S EP! ❤️</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Sarah Whittemore and I am thrilled to announce my first solo project. For those of you that don't know me, here's a little more info. Born and raised in Greensboro, NC I grew up with a heart for performing. From youth choirs and madrigals, to jazz trios and musical theatre, music has always been my passion. For the past 15 years, I have been a professional in the music industry and made my living as a live and studio vocalist.  I currently live in the Central Florida area with my husband, Scott, and our two dachshunds, Wilbur and Wendy.</p>
<p>I am making a Valentine's EP. While a cappella music is a love of mine, (You may have seen and heard me in the a cappella groups Voctave, or at Disney World with The Voices of Liberty) my first love has always been jazz music. Ever since I can remember, it has been my dream to record a jazz record of my own. I'm here to make that dream come true.</p>
<p>Making music is not a solitary endeavor. There are many moving parts. From studio time, to paying for musicians, producing, engineering, mixing and mastering, marketing, licensing, etc., you can imagine some of the costs incurred. While I have set aside personal funds for this project, I need your help to fully fund this EP.</p>
<p>Will you take this next step with me?</p>
<p>I hope you will.❤️</p>

<h2><strong>I Wish It So</strong></h2>
<p>""I could always guess what was in the Christmas gifts under the tree when I was small, and this year was no different - I knew exactly what my gift was: the opportunity to create a solo show for my favorite time of year.  And I’ve loved unwrapping it - illuminating a family story or a fond memory with fantastic songs, working on Howard Breitbart’s delicious arrangements.  The response was incredible, and getting to record it gives me so much joy.  <i>I Wish It So</i> is a gift of love and hope and laughter. I can’t wait for you to open it."" —Susan Derry</p>

If we don't reach our goal here, we will still honor the donations raised and perks promised, and continue to find funding through other means to make this happen. 


The Impact

This show brought so much joy to so many at a difficult moment for our world.  the subsequent album will be a perennial holiday album favorite, creating longevity for these esteemed artists' work well into the future. 
Despite the financial troubles wrought by the COVID-19 Pandemic, we believe there is strong interest from those who viewed this amazing live show that the energy is there to bring the project to fruition within a relatively low financial goal. 
We plan to interactively share messages, progress, and completion of the project through various social media, email, and podcast platforms.

<h3>Exploring the past and expressing the present...</h3>
<p>Dear Friends and Family, <br/><br/>I've spent most of my life digging though a heritage obfuscated in a sea of time, family lore, and past generations. Through the beauty of music I have found a path blossoming in knowledge.  A very special research project collaboration with mentor Heikki Koskinen,  <strong>Manala</strong> (netherworld)  is a representation of that deep cultural rediscovery through the lens of music weaving the elements of jazz, traditional folk, and free improvisation inspired by the mythic prose of cultural liberation and identity found in the Finnish National Epic known as the Kalevala as well as the folklore of Northern shamanic traditions. </p>
<p>This music has flung open the doors to the Finnish spirit I have always felt throughout my life. <br/>I am so grateful to the intrepid musicians who have made this new music project a reality:<br/><strong>Heikki Koskinen, Joshua Marshall, Gabby Fluke-Mogul, Tom Weeks, David Samas, Cheryl Leonard, Mark Clifford, Safa Shokrai, Max Judelson, and Timothy Orr.</strong></p>

<h3>Choice and the DIY Spirit</h3>
<p>I've been producing music for myself and the community for over thirty years holding to the DIY spirit.  Heikki and I have invested time and resources to make this project a reality which is why I launched this release campaign. I'm not asking for a hand out. If you connect to the music embedded in this project I hope you'll consider supporting me.<br/>In addition to the <strong>CD+digital release</strong>, I'm offering a <strong>rare DVD </strong>of our live debut from May 2019 at the <strong>Berkeley Finnish Hall</strong>. There are only 50 copies and no more will be pressed or sold through any retail outlet as it's only for this special campaign.<br/>Also for those who are hard core in experiencing this project I have hours and <strong>hours of raw video/audio</strong> performances of Heikki and I with the Otherworld Ensemble performing various iterations of Manala in Finland available in a thumb drive media bundle. Also, we're scheduled to perform June 13-14 the San Francisco premier in June.

<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>How is music part of your life? Are you a musician? A fan? Part of the music industry/business? Maybe you're even multiple of those. If music is a part of your life in the Pacific NW, it's likely at some point you've wanted to make the trek to Austin for the South by Southwest (SXSW) conference. Or if you have been able to make it, you know it's difficult, expensive, and it's gotten so big recently, maybe it's not worth it anymore as it's so hard to stand out and make personal connections.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But what if...what if...We were able to start a music conference and expo right here in the NW? The NW version of what made SXSW so special in the past? How would that look? Who would it involve? How amazing would it be? There's nothing else like this in our region, yet the talent, history, and community passion for music here is world class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And so, with this opportunity in mind, Northwest Music Experience (NWME) was born. It is underway. It is happening. This project has been in process for about 9 months now, with many, many hundreds of hours of volunteer time behind it already. We’re doing this for you and the larger NW Music Community we all are a part of. We have made tremendous progress, but are now at a critical stage where volunteer hours aren't enough. We must have an initial funding push in order to make this vision a reality and we are now asking for your financial contribution to help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's the rest of our vision and details about how your contribution will move us forward...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<h1>Northwest Music Experience is a convention/expo for musicians and industry professionals to develop and promote performance, as well as inspire and connect in community.</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Over a three day weekend (August 16-18, 2013) at Benaroya Hall in the heart of Seattle, NWME will provide an environment of collaboration and inspiration between musicians, music industry, and music fans. Musicians of every age, experience and skill level will find the tools they need to enhance their creativity, boost their productivity, hone their delivery, and find support in community. With keynotes, panels and breakout sessions as well as an industry packed expo floor during the day and performance showcases at local venues in the evening, NWME packs a lot into just a few days. Participants come to network, perform, learn, do business and enjoy the community of other artists and their fans. The goal is for this event to become an annual showcase of regional talent with a sprinkling of the best from the national and international music community, drawing speakers and attendees not only from the western region of the United States, but from around the world.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.nwmusicexperience.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nwmusicexperience.org</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Songwriters in Seattle is a non-profit organization with over 750 members that runs about 10 events for musicians every month throughout the Pacific NW region. Workshops, seminars, showcases, networking and business learning, collaboration, critiques, and informal jam sessions are all a part of the group’s dynamic calendar. Under the Songwriters in Seattle umbrella, NWME will be our flagship event bringing the amazing NW music community together to learn, grow and celebrate the talent of the region.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; Why</h3>
This is obviously a big project, and this fundraising campaign will not finance the entire thing - it is, however, a critical first stage. Why do we need financial contributions before you can even buy tickets? Why not get sponsors? Volunteer hours can, do, and will continue to help, but we have very little working capital to actually put something big in motion. In order to get to the point where we can sell tickets and sponsorships to get the serious money necessary to run the conference, we have to pay for some professional services to get the ball rolling.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are asking for $25,000 mainly to get our chosen professional event planning company (Varsity Communications) underway and pursuing larger sponsorships that will carry the financial longterm we have budgeted. While $25,000 is our target goal, our hope is to raise somewhere between $50,000 and $75,000 in order to give this event the smashing first year kick-off it deserves.

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>When and where is this event taking place?</strong></p>
<p>We just announced it - August 16-18 at Benaroya Hall in downtown Seattle! See the updates for more info</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What music genre(s) will be represented at NWME?</strong></p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest music scene is so wonderfully diverse! Rock, folk, blues, hip hop, electronic, jazz, classical, country, and more all have lively scenes here. We will be involving as much of it as we possibly can. Join us and represent!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I just buy tickets? Are the larger contribution levels just buying tickets?</strong></p>
<p>The sale of event tickets has not begun yet and tickets are not available for purchase. You are contributing to a fundraising campaign that will make this event a reality. All references to tickets as perks/incentives will require future registration for actual tickets when they are available. These rewards are easily transferrable if, for instance, you are a fan who would like to give your reward conference ticket(s) to a musician who would benefit from the conference and expo tracks, but you just want to go to the VIP party and performances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Since Songwriters in Seattle (the group running NWME) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, is my contribution tax deductible?</strong></p>
<p>The portion of your donation that does not pay for products or services (tickets, hats, CDs, etc.) as part of your incentive package should be tax deductible. The value of some incentives have not yet been determined, but Songwriters in Seattle will be happy to provide a donation explanation letter for your tax records upon request at the time when all associated values have been finalized. That being said, please consult a tax advisor for details and appropriate tax consequences in your specific situation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>In the perks/incentives list, there is reference to drawings for 1 ticket each to the conference and/or VIP party and 2 tickets each to the same. How is that going to work?</strong></p>
<p>We will do two separate sets of drawings (VIP party and conference) for two pools of people. The drawings for 1 ticket will only include $25-$50 contributors. The drawings for 2 tickets will only be for $100-$500 contributors (so you've got a pretty good shot!). 3 total tickets for each of the VIP party and conference will be given away.</p></div>","Backstory

We are asking for $25,000 mainly to get our chosen professional event planning company (Varsity Communications) underway and pursuing larger sponsorships that will carry the financial longterm we have budgeted. While $25,000 is our target goal, our hope is to raise somewhere between $50,000 and $75,000 in order to give this event the smashing first year kick-off it deserves. Here are our campaign budget projections:

Be A Part Of Something Big
We want you to participate and we have lots of perks/incentives to give you as thanks for contributing. Starting at just $5, you can be recognized as part of the grassroots effort to launch this amazing event. Or go in with a group (or corporate sponsorship) and get the VIP treatment throughout the event at the $2,500 level and above.
 
Even if you can't contribute, that doesn’t mean you can’t help - Please share this campaign on social media using the Indiegogo share tools or even just this campaign page link! This affects music communities from Portland to Vancouver, Spokane to Olympia to Port Angeles and everywhere in between (would love some representation from Idaho as well!). Get the word out!
 
You can also sign up as an event volunteer at http://www.nwmusicexperience.org

 
Thank you very much and hope to see you there!
 
FAQ
When and where is this event taking place?
We just announced it - August 16-18 at Benaroya Hall in downtown Seattle! See the updates for more info
 
What music genre(s) will be represented at NWME?
The Pacific Northwest music scene is so wonderfully diverse! Rock, folk, blues, hip hop, electronic, jazz, classical, country, and more all have lively scenes here. We will be involving as much of it as we possibly can. Join us and represent!
 
Can I just buy tickets? Are the larger contribution levels just buying tickets?
The sale of event tickets has not begun yet and tickets are not available for purchase. You are contributing to a fundraising campaign that will make this event a reality. All references to tickets as perks/incentives will require future registration for actual tickets when they are available. These rewards are easily transferrable if, for instance, you are a fan who would like to give your reward conference ticket(s) to a musician who would benefit from the conference and expo tracks, but you just want to go to the VIP party and performances.
 
Since Songwriters in Seattle (the group running NWME) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, is my contribution tax deductible?
The portion of your donation that does not pay for products or services (tickets, hats, CDs, etc.) as part of your incentive package should be tax deductible. The value of some incentives have not yet been determined, but Songwriters in Seattle will be happy to provide a donation explanation letter for your tax records upon request at the time when all associated values have been finalized. That being said, please consult a tax advisor for details and appropriate tax consequences in your specific situation.
 
In the perks/incentives list, there is reference to drawings for 1 ticket each to the conference and/or VIP party and 2 tickets each to the same. How is that going to work?
We will do two separate sets of drawings (VIP party and conference) for two pools of people. The drawings for 1 ticket will only include $25-$50 contributors. The drawings for 2 tickets will only be for $100-$500 contributors (so you've got a pretty good shot!). 3 total tickets for each of the VIP party and conference will be given away.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Help us publish a Christmas song written and performed by people either homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Would you like to be involved in a music project that could change lives? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Would you like to celebrate people overcoming very real barriers to make great art?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Would you like to be involved in helping possibly bother the Christmas chart?</strong> <br/><br/></p>
<p>Hello,<br/><br/>We would like help with a music project with the potential to change lives. <strong> </strong></p>
<p>We’re releasing a Christmas single and we need your help to publicize it.</p>
<p><strong>This won’t be the average po<strong>p-star Christmas song.</strong>  </strong>Our song was written and performed by a songwriter and choir brought together by the help they received through charities for people at risk of homelessness, or that are homeless. Particularly through the Mentoring scheme offered to volunteers at Crisis Skylight Newcastle.<br/><br/>Our single will be released in order to raise money for these charities, to help them carry on providing such important services. There have been several philanthropic Christmas singles in the past, but rarely do they feature the kinds of people that will benefit from the money, and we want to change that.</p>
<h3>Most of the work is already done, by music professionals volunteering their time:</h3>
<p>The song will be supported with work by music and video professionals from the North East of England; music studios, producers and film-makers have volunteered their time to record and video the single (more details below).</p>
<p> </p>
All of the recording and production is already scheduled in for this Autumn; we’ll have a high quality recording of a fantastic, seriously catchy song – with a full choir, violin section and sleigh bell jingles.  We’re hoping you find the idea as exciting as we do, because we don’t have any limit to ambitions when it comes to who we’d like to hear the song.</div>
<div>
<h3>
<br/>That's why we're looking to raise money to publicize the finished single:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We’d like the song to be:<br/><br/>* Played on the radio <br/>* Written about in the press <br/>* Shared on the internet <br/>* Talked about at work<br/>* Bought in thousands<br/>* Everything else<br/><br/>We and you can help that to some extent, but we want to make sure a lot of work goes into doing those things. This is a song with an inspiring story behind it, and it needs to be heard. We'll have things in place so that this tune, with everyone’s help, could reach the Christmas chart.</p>
<p>Mostly, we’re hoping you are as keen as we are to see the success of people involved, who have overcame real disadvantage in the creation of this project.</p>
<strong>For any of this to happen we need your help. </strong><br/><br/>We’re aiming to raise funds to put toward publicity for the song and our target is to raise the money to pay a professional firm to work hard promoting the song over the festive period.  This is the only thing that we need to pay for.</div>
<h3>Help us by putting in an advance order of the single, checking out our various perks, or telling your friends about this project:</h3>
<div>If you’d like to help us, and help the people and charities involved, please consider a donation or an advance order of the single (which you will receive as a download or CD and Download ) as soon as its finished and released in the first week of December 2012.<br/><br/>We also have a number of exciting perks, like gig tickets in the North East of England, merchandise from bands on Tiny Lights Recordings, badges and stickers recognizing the vital help you've given us.</div>

<div><strong>IF THE PROJECT BEATS ITS FUNDING TARGET WE'LL MAKE A MORE AMBITIOUS PRESS CAMPAIGN. FURTHER DONATIONS AND THE PROCEEDS OF THE SINGLE WILL GO TO STREETWISE CHOIR, AND TO CRISIS- THE NATIONAL CHARITY FOR SINGLE HOMELESS PEOPLE.<br/><br/>IF WE DON'T REACH OUR TARGET, WE WILL AIM TO USE WHATEVER WE DO RAISE FOR MORE COST-EFFECTIVE PROMOTION.<br/></strong></div>

This time we are going to release a full length album.  Complete with professional packaging and a promotional campaign to back it up.  Having worked with the right producer and recording studio it's only a matter of raising the funds.  Little things add up when making an album.  Just paying for the studio time and mixing will cost $400 per song.
Full Length Album Costs: $8100

$5200 Recording, Mixing and Mastering
$2200 Pressing Packaging 2500 CD's
$700 Marketing and Promotion 
      
When it comes to playing shows we don't mess around.  Playing nearly 100 shows in the last 3 years.  Touring the west coast and traveling all around our home state of Washington.  So tour is no stranger to us.  We don't need fancy accommodations as we usually couch surf, camp and check in at the occasional $50 motel if we are feeling glamorous.
We have toured the West Coast to great success but would like to branch out to other areas of the United States (and eventually beyond).  We are currently booking our 7 day tour of the Rockies.
Touring Costs: $1730

$1100 Gas and Van Rental
$600 Food and Lodging
$30 Stuffed Animals (We need tour mascots)
This music is our passion.  We just need help getting to our goal.

<h3>Rotule has been in the longboard business since 2008.</h3>

<p>Since 2008 Rotule has been making the most durable and most performance-oriented boards on the market. We were the first longboard brand to introduce the carbon/basalt sandwich construction. We have not cut a single corner in our production and we believe that you cannot put a price on perfection. Unfortunately, perfection does come with a price.</p>
<p>When we started this project, we didn't want to be just another company that subcontracted their products; we wanted to do it all ourselves. We wanted to learn everything and be able to say that we built our products with our own two hands. Our company grew surely but slowly due largely to lack of funding. We have the tools, we have the knowledge, we've even won business startup prizes:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.rotulelongboards.com/Nicolas%20Brunet/r%C3%A9gion.prix.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p><span>But we have had no luck in finding banks and organizations to support us. We must admit our financial statements have not yet been good enough to convince any banks to lend us money. But four years into our business we are still here. We know our business model is working we just need to scale up. We won't make tons of money, but we will be able to live off it.</span></p>
<p><span class=""hps""> </span></p>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>We've decided to come up with our first ""traditional-construction"" board; an 8-ply, rock maple board. We will continue to build our previous models (were awesome and widely praised by the downhill longboard community). However, they were expensive and only targeted a small group of people, mainly the professional riders. Our new, ""affordable"" deck will retail for only 150$ and is designed for a wider market.</p>
<p>We designed this model to suit the current trends and demands of the community: a freeride/downhill deck with a kicktail. It offers our signature concave, which locks your feet in while being very comfortable. It also features our renowned 3D designs which we call ""free form"". It means that everythings in the shape has progressive and complex curves. In this manner, we have really adapted our concave to the human foot. This gives the rider, whether professional or amateur, confidence and comfort in any position they might want to place their feet on the board.</p>

<h3>What we need</h3>
<p>Right now what we need more than anything is the capital to start production of this board! You can see this as a very awesome, ultra, turbo, pre-order deal! The truth is we have always had problems in getting our fresh release out on time and missing the begining of the season, in turn. So we need YOU to help US start our production and make this sublime deck available IN TIME !</p>
<p>So why can't we just start building them now? Currently, we don't have the money to buy the materials to keep the production going for more than a week. The winters are hard to survive in this business, so we make small runs of boards, sell them, them get money to build more! But now we need to be able to build non-stop until we have enough to release in the spring! That is the way it works right? And if we sell enough of these, we may get things right enough to grow to our true potential; more boards, more visibility, hiring people and build a team! Many have succeeded in this manner so why not us?</p>
<p>We are truly passionate in our sport, and we can assure you this deck will be as good as it gets. Jonathan, will be drawing the new graphic during the holidays, and we will try to make the sickest graphic we have ever made!</p>

My name is Dan Olivo. I am an Italian/American actor and jazz singer based in Los Angeles. For the last few years I have had the amazing opportunity to perform the songs I love. I have been fortunate to be able to appear with my jazz combo at various concerts, festivals, venues and private events all over Southern California.
 
Some of my most recent performances have included Bar Nineteen12 at the historic Beverly Hills Hotel, the fabulous 570 KLAC Mistletoe and Martini Christmas Concert at The Universal Amphitheatre (which also included acts like Natalie Cole, Frank Sinatra Jr., Steve Tyrell and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy), and The Eagle Rock Music Festival.
 
MY DREAM
I love The Great American Songbook which include the songs of Frank Sinatra, Nat ""King"" Cole, Dean Martin, Ella Fitzgerald, Tony Bennett, Bobby Darin, Harry Connick Jr. and Michael Bublé. These songs are timeless and it has been my lifelong dream to one day record a big band album. That time is now.
 
I have teamed together with my dear friend and fabulous musician, arranger and band leader Brendan McMullin and some of LA's best musicians in hopes of creating an album of some classic standards, songs of today that could have been standards, and one or two originals. I also plan to invite a special guest or two to join me in a duet.
 
MY GOAL
To raise a total of $15,000 - $20,000 split up in three Phases. Phase 1 will include the cost of writing, arranging, and obtaining the rights to record twelve songs. It will also include promotional materials such as photos, videos and marketing materials.
 
Phase 2, which like Phase 3 will come at a later date, will include the actual cost of studio time, the musicians, and mixing fees. Lastly we have the final phase, Phase 3, which will include the cost of post recording, CD production, CD cover art, cases, digital downloads, and merchandising materials (hats, t-shirts, posters, and the launch of the CD release concert).
 
REALIZING THE DREAM
By contributing to the production of the Dan Olivo Big Band Album you are not only helping me fulfill a lifelong dream, but you are in effect helping to keep the Great American Songbook alive. This album will be enjoyed by all who love the great standards, and will also act as the calling card for my band and me to draw in other opportunities to play the music we love.
 
Those of you who are able to contribute will be entitled to some fabulous perks including an autographed CD, digital downloads, a copy of a signed photo of the entire band as a thank you card, hats, t-shirts, your name with a thank you message on the album, and the opportunity to come to a free concert such as the album release party.
 
For those who simply cannot make a financial contribution, you can still help make this dream a reality. There is no greater marketing tool than word of mouth. Please let your friends and family know about this campaign. Let them know that there are still many of us left who love this music and want to keep it alive for this generation and those to come.
 
The Great American Songbook is simply the greatest music of all time. It is my passion and my dream to share it with the world. Please help the Dan Olivo Big Band Project achieve this goal.

<p><strong>SHORT SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt 5:14-16</strong><em> (Amp) You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.</em><strong><em>15</em></strong><em>Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a peck measure, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house.</em><strong><em>16</em></strong><em>Let your light so shine before men that they may see your moral excellence and your praiseworthy, noble, and good deeds and recognize and honor and praise and glorify your Father Who is in heaven.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>We live in a generation</strong> where evil is deemed as good and good as evil. Emedded in our culture, music, and media are doctrines surrounding our youth with a a dark hopeless outlook on life. We continuously see the fruit of these perverse seeds planted day in and day out. Jesus died so we could not settle for what this world would feed us, but that we may by His spirit create a life on earth that honored Him, full of light and life, a life in abundance. The Word calls us all City Lights, so will you shine with us?</p>
<p><strong>City Lights</strong> Ministries began in May of 2011 and currently consists of Cory Ard (Amasiah), Jordan Hall (J. Carter), and Gavin Palmer (Raging Moses), (Evan Ford-Artist/Drummer), as well as the many others that make the ministry run behind the scenes, .  <strong>We are a collective of individuals who aim, using our gifts in music, to encourage, inspire, and challenge a generation to pursue God, igniting them with a passion to light up the world.</strong>  By doing what the bible says, using our transformed lives by the Blood of Christ to shine our lights into a dark and dying culture, we aim honor the sacrifice of Jesus Christ with our influence and giftings.  <strong>We aspire to create music inspired by the Holy Spirit, using it to serve our community with outreach &amp; discipleship.</strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>This campaign will not only enable us to <strong>continue the great work</strong> God has started but we feel now more than ever God is prepared to exponentially expand the reach/influence of City Lights as a ministry. This is part of our calling, it is our passion and with the <strong>new mixtape</strong> and vision implemented,<strong> Jesus's name will be glorified!</strong> 2012 proved to be an amazing year for City Lights! We were able to travel all over Colorado, participating in many different events orchestrating free concerts. With the help of partners and individuals blessing the ministry we were also able to <strong>give out over 3,000 free CDs</strong>, make many valuable connections locally and globally, and see the fruit of thousands of transformed lives. We were blown away at God’s favor and the testimonies of all the people we were privileged to come in contact with. As of May of 2012 City Lights as a ministry felt God calling us into a season of rebuilding and preparation for what was to come, and <strong>THAT TIME IS NOW!!</strong>   </p>

Faithful supporters, such as yourself, have supplied the foundation and enabled every stride this ministry has taken thus far. Because of your support, partnering, and prayers this ministry has flourished even in the short year and a half since we began.  For this <strong>New Year</strong> we intend to <strong>launch our first ever street team, have product readily available for street events, make CD and merchandise production more efficient, design a brand new upgraded website, and invest in the media team for promotions and outreach.</strong>  We also intend to continue to disciple and develop young leaders introducing opportunities for them to be used by God in greater capacities. </p>

<h3>Grounded EP</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Grounded (aka Fatt Melten). I make music that you may or may not enjoy, but lucky for me money doesn't have a genre preference!</p>
<p>I've spent that last 5 years learning, trying, failing, succeeding, and experimenting in electronic music production. My path stylistically has been all over the map over the years, but with this EP I feel I've finally found my sound and am ready to share it. With your support I will be able to fund the final stages of production, release, and promotion and get the Grounded EP out by the end of the year!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>There is a lot of work and quite a few expenses involved with releasing a body of music properly. The money this campaign raises will be put towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional mastering </li>
<li>Track copyrights</li>
<li>Promotional materials/tools</li>
<li>Merchandise</li>
<li>Spotify/iTunes placement</li>
<li>An EP release party (which you're all invited to)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each tier of donations includes it's own perks including a digital download of the EP, posters, t-shirts, and even a custom made song! </p>

But for me, going home doesn't mean stop; it's an open door to the next chapter! </p><div>
<p></p>
<p><span>In Spring of 2015, I will be working to release my Debut EP, That 4Letter Word, which is to be recorded at BlackBird Studios in Nashville, TN. This EP is a deliberate statement between me and each of my fans - new and old. It will feature six of my best songs, and is my firm declaration to each one of you that I am serious about my music and my dreams becoming reality.</span></p>
<p>It means pushing myself and not limiting myself to only what I can do alone, and so I need your help.</p>
<p>I have a team that shares my vision and is dedicated to doing it right (an amazing producer, sound engineer and full band), and have booked 11 days in the studio including post production. With all these components, we’re projecting a $15,000 project cost.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think that’s such a lofty goal, but if 375 people give a total of $40 each we will reach our goal in no time!  And I hope that in my efforts to reach my goals, I inspire you to dare to dream big, to believe in that dream, and to live it out with all of your heart.</p>
<p>Even the smallest donation is a much appreciated gift so I’d like to gift back to you.</p>
<br/><p>For a $5 donation you’ll receive my iTunes single from the EP.<span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">For a $10 donation you’ll receive a digital copy of the EP. <span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">For larger donations I have other perks I’ll be making available so as to show my appreciation to you for your financial support.</span></p>I love you all and I thank you for never giving up on me and helping turn my dream into reality. <p>

Check out my performances here:Blind: Battle: http://youtu.be/FtS2JXKAGSI But as Pharrell said, ""everyone, at the end of the day, goes home."" But for me, going home doesn't mean stop; it's an open door to the next chapter! 

In Spring of 2015, I will be working to release my Debut EP, That 4Letter Word, which is to be recorded at BlackBird Studios in Nashville, TN. This EP is a deliberate statement between me and each of my fans - new and old. It will feature six of my best songs, and is my firm declaration to each one of you that I am serious about my music and my dreams becoming reality.
It means pushing myself and not limiting myself to only what I can do alone, and so I need your help.
I have a team that shares my vision and is dedicated to doing it right (an amazing producer, sound engineer and full band), and have booked 11 days in the studio including post production. With all these components, we’re projecting a $15,000 project cost.
Sometimes I think that’s such a lofty goal, but if 375 people give a total of $40 each we will reach our goal in no time!  And I hope that in my efforts to reach my goals, I inspire you to dare to dream big, to believe in that dream, and to live it out with all of your heart.
Even the smallest donation is a much appreciated gift so I’d like to gift back to you.
For a $5 donation you’ll receive my iTunes single from the EP.For a $10 donation you’ll receive a digital copy of the EP. For larger donations I have other perks I’ll be making available so as to show my appreciation to you for your financial support.I love you all and I thank you for never giving up on me and helping turn my dream into reality.

<p>Hello</p>
<p>Im Jeff Best, I have been in the music biz since 1998, although I did record one album and toured all over the world, I still have a passion and fire to connect with people through music.</p>

<p>I will be use the funds for studio time, paying the musicians, paying an engineer and all costs related to recording and mixing 4 to 5 new songs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I own one of the coolest online radio stations for country music in the world, countryradio.com. I will use countryradio.com and all its resources to push my new music out to the thousands of fans who listen to my station everyday!</p>
<p>At countryradio.com, I only play independent country artists like myself, so when people come to my station, they know they are not going to here the big country stars, they are hearing unfiltered, pure country music, you cant hear any where else.</p>
<p>I make it my duty to find artists who are just as good if not better than most of the main stream artists we have out there today, and since the current listeners seem to like my music, the new songs should do very well.</p>

<h3>The Ultimate Goal &amp; Mission</h3>
<p>Your contribution helps mobilize and energize our music company in a way we have not been able to ever before. We are poised to introduce a new outlook on socio-economic activism by way of music and artistic cultivation. By using the influential power of music and art to captivatingly educate, stimulate economic growth, radiate positive energy &amp; re-direct cultural media hyper-trending combined with charitable philantropy, we are pioneering a new age of humanitarianism.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need a positive change in our media more than ever these days, evident in how the urban music culture has detoriated to a state of sexual objectivity and crive glorification. The youth have been dis-jointed from the morals and maxims of peaceful co-existence and the music industry has its fingers on the pule of the younger generation. By supporting efforts like mine, because there are many you are making a stand towards the corrupt and perverse world views that are perpetuated on a large scale through music media. All people have a cause, but not all can be the voice of it, You have tools, We have tools, Our voice is one of them, if you need someone to speak on your behalf, join our cause by contributing. One Love.</li>

If we do not reach our goal, all funds and proceeds from this campaign will be prorated and allocated accordingly to the two products specified in our financial summary and we will produce as many of each that the budget allows, and take it from there. Though numbers are nice and ideally we would like to hit the ground running as hard and as fast as we can, if we do not accomplish our funding goal starting small we can still make an impact.




The Ultimate Goal & Mission
Your contribution helps mobilize and energize our music company in a way we have not been able to ever before. We are poised to introduce a new outlook on socio-economic activism by way of music and artistic cultivation. By using the influential power of music and art to captivatingly educate, stimulate economic growth, radiate positive energy & re-direct cultural media hyper-trending combined with charitable philantropy, we are pioneering a new age of humanitarianism.

We need a positive change in our media more than ever these days, evident in how the urban music culture has detoriated to a state of sexual objectivity and crive glorification. The youth have been dis-jointed from the morals and maxims of peaceful co-existence and the music industry has its fingers on the pule of the younger generation. By supporting efforts like mine, because there are many you are making a stand towards the corrupt and perverse world views that are perpetuated on a large scale through music media. All people have a cause, but not all can be the voice of it, You have tools, We have tools, Our voice is one of them, if you need someone to speak on your behalf, join our cause by contributing. One Love.

Here is One of Our Signature Music Videos just to give you another feel of our media.

MONEY IS NEVER THE ONLY WAY!
We understand the economy is rough and many of you may be feeling compelled to help but may not be able to give money at this time. One of the biggest ways to contribute to the cause is to spread the word and build awareness to the movement. Tell a friend, tell a family member, tweet about us, share us on facebook. Any assistance is golden.


Thank you so much for your time and consideration and we really appreciate the help! one love!

I've been raising a child, working as a spiritual director and retreat leader, founding and leading a spiritual direction training program, and making music with Richard, my husband and partner in music. It's been deeply fulfilling work and so much goodness has sprung from it. But as the years marched on, I began feeling homesick for my solo music -- writing, recording and performing -- and longed to know and share that part of myself again.   I took 2012 as a year of sabbatical to reflect and replenish, and reacquaint myself with my music.</span></span></p>

I can't wait to share it with you. 
 
Hello, friends! We're in the final week of crowdfuning! 
With the incredible support of my wonderful friends and fans, we're nearly 60% funded! We completed our first session of Barn Recording at the Seed Savers Exchange barn; now, we're waiting to be sure we're funded before heading back to to finish up with the band. Your contributions will make it possible for us to complete the album and get it playing in your ears, where it's really meant to be.
Before reading any further, please take a moment to watch my new video. 

 
Thank you! Continue on...
 
 
Yup, a whole decade.  
The last ten years have been full. I've been raising a child, working as a spiritual director and retreat leader, founding and leading a spiritual direction training program, and making music with Richard, my husband and partner in music. It's been deeply fulfilling work and so much goodness has sprung from it. But as the years marched on, I began feeling homesick for my solo music -- writing, recording and performing -- and longed to know and share that part of myself again.   I took 2012 as a year of sabbatical to reflect and replenish, and reacquaint myself with my music.
 

That was also the year we planted our first garden. My sense of adventure took over. When we ran out of space in the backyard, I began peeling back sod all around our house to plant more and more produce. (Why, yes, those were big purple cabbages right outside our front door.) 
The practice of working with the earth, planting seeds, and growing wholesome, organic food for my family took root within me in surprising ways. Hands in the dirt and face in the sun, I hummed little songs and let the dream of a new solo album start to take shape. 
 
 
Fast forward to now, Summer 2013, where the lush green of growing things meets brand new music ready to blossom forth.    
 
 
 

A new Trish record:   Wild Acre.  
  
   Solo, but not alone. 
These are not the songs I thought I would write. They're stronger.  These are not the stories I thought I would be telling. They're richer.   This is not the album I set out to make. It's better.  
Everything about WILD ACRE is finer than I'd even hoped. Why? Because I'm not doing it alone.   Yes, it's a solo album, but I'm working with some incredibly talented folks, and together we're creating a project that's more than the sum of our parts. It's deepened, ripened, and gotten juicier in all the best ways. 
My previous recording ventures were written, arranged, recorded and packaged on my own with the help of my husband in our home studio. Richard and I have enjoyed this way of delivering new, shrink-wrapped beauty to our beloved listeners. It's been pretty ""Mom and Pop"" style. In all, Richard and I have made more than a dozen CDs together (no doubt we'll make more!), and I love what we've created.
  But WILD ACRE was asking for something different…   
 
I've made independent music my career for nearly twenty years. Why try something new now?
  In the decade since my last solo record, I've changed. Technology has changed. The music industry has changed… a lot. I wanted to live into that change. To challenge myself as an artist and songwriter and press the edges of anything I'd done before.
  When it came time to think about who would produce and play on the record, I consulted indie rock 'n' roll artist and long-time friend Jonathan Rundman to help me navigate some options. Jonathan encouraged me to dream bigger about what this album could be, and connected me with Jake Armerding, producer, singer-songwriter, and player-extraordinaire-of-all-things-stringed. Jake soon signed on as my producer and principal arranger for the record, and we've also co-written several of the songs together. His gifts have helped steer the Wild Acre project into new and fun places, and we've jumped in with a sense of adventure.  
 
A return to real-life roots. As the project has unfolded, a clear theme has been emerging. The music of Wild Acre hearkens back to the songs of my own musical beginnings: acoustic, Americana, roots-infused, real-life story songs comprised of themes both lovely and raw, weaving threads of love, loss, sweetness, ache and redemption. Some of my early influences have even come back around with some unexpected and welcome inspiration. 
 
  
Born in a Barn In thinking about where to record this album, we wanted a setting that would bring out the rich character of the music and contribute to the soul of the project. A vacuum sealed studio isolation room felt a little too sterile for our purposes, but a barn… now that might just work! 
 
Wild Acre meets Seed Savers Exchange Seed Savers Exchange has graciously made the barn on their 890-acre Heritage Farm, near Decorah, Iowa available for our recording sessions. I'm beyond thrilled!
 

 
When I think back to humming my way through last year's garden planting -- using seeds our neighbor had saved and shared -- I am in open-mouthed awe at this Wild Acre-Seed Savers Exchange partnership.
Seed to seed, garden to garden, community by community, this music is coming to life.
  
 
How to Plant an Album You could say Wild Acre is similar to the work of a community garden, or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture). (Or, as Jake calls it, Community Supprted Arts.) Making an album of this caliber requires a tremendous investment of time, energy, money, and people coming together at just the right moment. Without the backing of a label, I am unable to fund this alone. In addition to all the behind-the-scenes musical ""farm hands"",  I want to invite you -- my community of listeners, supporters, and fans -- to join us and fund this project.
Together, we have 40 days! Let's bring this Wild Acre to life!  
 
Where the Money Goes  Every dollar you contribute goes directly toward the creation of this album and getting it into the world. Plus, because I have fiscal sponsorship through Fractured Atlas, a significant portion of what you give is tax-deductible. Score one for both of us!  
Our fundraising goal is $20,000. This will cover the basic cost of recording the album.
Your pledges allow me to do these things:      


pay my producer, Jake Armerding 


carry out our barn studio recording sessions 


hire top-notch musicians 


mix and master the album at a pro studio    


manufacture and duplicate the CDs    


make great album art with a photographer and graphic designer    


pay royalties and mechanical licensing 


cover the fundraising fees  


cover travel expenses for myself, the producer and the musicians

 
Dreaming Bigger. Wild Acre is by far the most universally accessible of all my albums, making this the perfect opportunity to extend the latitude of my music. My greatest hope is that the songs will reach new listeners, open the door to fresh venues, and place me in front of wider audiences. I'd be delighted if this record also led to collaborative ventures with other musicians whose work I love and admire. Dreams for a Barn Concert Tour are sprouting, and we'd love to bring this music to a barn near you!  
  Our budget does not, however, cover album promotion, distribution or concert tours, all of which are essential to getting the music out into the world. If we exceed our goal, the extra capital will go toward the requisite components for successful promotion, distribution and tours.  
Making this album - and sharing it as widely as possible - is deeply important to me. If we don't reach the funding goal, we will still make this album, but we'll need to make some hard, careful choices about where to compromise.
 Anybody Want a Peanut? When I say ""I can't do this without you"", I really mean it.   What we're able to do on the record is directly tied to the funding we receive. Thank you for the opportunity to continue making great music that means so much to me. And remember… a portion of your contributions are tax deductible with my fiscal sponsorship through Fractured Atlas.    
Many hands...Obviously, raising funds to meet our Wild Acre budget is one vital and tangible way you can help. But there are other ways, too. As you pass the word on to your network of friends and family, you're reaching people and places I could never reach alone.

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$5300- Additional musician costs for rehearsal time and soloists</li>
<li>$6300- Two extra songs added to the EP</li>
<li>$8450-  I'll scrap the EP idea and make a full length recording</li>

<p></p>
<p>Given the competitive nature of the music industry and the resources now readily available to emerging artists, it's important to have a top quality product to distinguish myself from the competition. With your help I will have the means to showcase my songs in their most organic form, utilizing a studio that gives me the ability to perform live with great musicians and capture the emotion and sensibility within each individual track. In a market that's saturated with great sounding productions, I aim to let the strength of my compositions, and the individual talents of my musicians shine through, maintaining the integrity of performance based music sometimes lost from a bygone era. </p>

</div></div>","Hello!
I'm Peter Slocombe and welcome to my Indiegogo fundraising page. 
Most people know me as a professional saxophone player based in Los Angeles. However, I also have a strong love for songwriting and have been working for the last three years to create a body of original work that I'm proud of and excited to share. 
Taking elements from my Jazz background and blending them with country and folk music, I've found my unique voice. Creating lyric driven music inspired by events in my life, I've searched for universal themes that relate to the human experience. 




Here's the scoop!

It's taken me a long time to build up the courage to expose my songwriting. I decided that my 30th birthday (8/21/14) would be a great time to take a leap of faith and do it.  
Your contribution will provide me with the means to record my music in a professional studio with a group of amazing musicians. Having a great sounding EP will give me the opportunity to build my fan base, receive positive reviews, attract commercial interest, and pitch my act to performance venues.  




The Breakdown!
I have carefully calculated the cost of producing a polished recording on a budget. I'm fortunate to have a great network of producers, engineers, and musicians eager to help. Here are the specifics of what your contribution will support:

Studio Fees $1900
Musicians $750
Disk Pressing $600
Album Artwork $200
Mailing $500
Taxes and Credit Card Charges $395




What's on the Menu?

Yes, there are perks that come with a donation to my campaign. Sticking to my British roots, I've laid them out like a pub menu. I'm sure you'll find something to quell your appetite, just look to the right. :) Cheers!  





Stretch Goals


Due
to the fantastic news that my campaign has successfully reached it's goal
early, I have implemented ""Stretch Goals"" to utilize excess funding.


$5300- Additional musician costs for rehearsal time and soloists
$6300- Two extra songs added to the EP
$8450-  I'll scrap the EP idea and make a full length recording

The Impact

Given the competitive nature of the music industry and the resources now readily available to emerging artists, it's important to have a top quality product to distinguish myself from the competition. With your help I will have the means to showcase my songs in their most organic form, utilizing a studio that gives me the ability to perform live with great musicians and capture the emotion and sensibility within each individual track. In a market that's saturated with great sounding productions, I aim to let the strength of my compositions, and the individual talents of my musicians shine through, maintaining the integrity of performance based music sometimes lost from a bygone era. 



Risks &
Challenges














There are always risks and challenges to pursuing any dream and I have
overcome many hurdles to bring me to where I am today. When I started out as a
professional saxophone player, I placed unrealistic expectations upon myself to
try and ""make it."" My rigorous practice routine and self induced
stress took their toll and I ended up taking a number of breaks from performing
to heal some severe repetitive strain issues. 
The damage from my younger years has stayed with me and stunted my
chances of reaching my goal as a  world class Jazz saxophonist. Although I
might have lost that dream, many unforeseen paths have opened up from my
experience. I now play a number of instruments other than saxophone, and enjoy
a variety of styles of music outside of Jazz. I started working on songwriting
and singing and have enjoyed working with a music form that allows me to learn
from and share my experiences. 
I am sure that I will face many more complications in the future, but as
they say in England ""chin up, boy.""

<p>I'm Elise Bellew, most well known as the singer/songwriter for the indie dream pop band The Mary Dream. With The Mary Dream, we were completely independent and worked very hard to develop our own unique sound and style of ""vibey alternative pop/rock"". With The Mary Dream I had many TV placements on shows such as The Real World, All My Children, Heartland and more : ) Also, our very first full-length CD ""Beautiful World"" (2006) was just added to Pandora Radio this October!</p>
<p>I am now embarking on a new musical journey as a solo artist and this is where I need your help!!!</p>
<p>Because of the incredible generosity of some very talented people, I was able to record my first solo EP ""Bellew Christmas"" last December. I still can't believe all the miracles that happened to make that recording possible! But now it's time to record again and I need your help to raise enough money to record a brand new EP next Spring in Nashville!</p>
<p>The new EP will contain 5 brand new Original Songs written by me, and will be produced by myself and Nashville engineer/producer Michael Head.</p>
<p>With my Christmas EP, I worked meticulously to co-produce and oversee every detail of the recording process to make sure I took The Mary Dream sound to the next musical level... I will be doing the same thing on my new EP and already have some fresh new musical influences to bring to the recording studio...</p>
<p>Music is the love of my life. Helping me achieve this dream to record again would be miraculous and I'm excited to invite you to become a part of my next musical journey : ) ~Elise</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Breakdown of Recording Costs</h3> <p>My goal with this Indiegogo Campaign is to raise a total of $10,000 to record, mix and master 5 new songs. Here is the breakdown of Recording Costs:</p>
<p><b>2 Full Weeks of Recording Time:</b> Recording will take place with Michael Head at a well-established recording studio located on Nashville's historic Music Row. Sessions will be Monday through Friday, 9-5 for 2 weeks. <b>Recording Schedule:</b> Day 1-2: Arranging &amp; Pre-Production; Day 3: Drums; Day 4: Guitars; Day 5: Keys; Day 6: Bass; Days 7-14: Main Vocals &amp; Background Vocals.</p>
<p><b>2-4 Weeks Mixing &amp; Mastering:</b> An additional 2-4 weeks of Michael Head's time will be needed to Mix and Master the recording once all the tracks have been completed.</p>
<p><b>Total for Recording Time, Mixing &amp; Mastering = $5500</b><br/>The total amount Michael's studio usually charges for the above is $7500. Michael has generously offered to reduce this amount to $5500 to make my goal more achievable.</p>
<p><b>Session Musician Budget Total = $2400</b></p>
<p>The Nashville Session Musicians that I use are so talented and experienced that they are able to record ALL 5 SONGS IN ONE DAY EACH. Session Musicians in Nashville usually work for Union Rates, but for my project, they are all willing to work for indie rates. The indie rate for 1 day for each session musician is $600 per day:</p>
<p>1 Full Day Drum Recording = $600<br/>1 Full Day Keyboard Recording = $600<br/>1 Full Day Guitar Recording (both acoustic &amp; electric) = $600<br/>1 Full Day Bass Recording = $600<br/></p>
<p><b>Roundtrip Travel Expenses to Nashville (Rental Car + Gas) = $700</b><br/>This Total includes Economy Rental Car &amp; Gas for 18 days (2 days driving time each way to Nashville plus 14 days driving to and from Recording Studio). (I don't fly to Nashville to save money since I have to rent a car anyway. I also don't fly because I have to keep my recording dates flexible to fit into Michael's recording schedule in between his higher paying clients.)</p>
<p><b>Lodging Expenses for 2 Weeks (Includes 2 Driving Nights) = $886 </b><br/>Extended Stay America = 14 Nights in Nashville = $756<br/>1 Night hotel each way in between driving days (2 Nights Total) = $130<br/><br/><b>Miscellaneous Expenses &amp; Variable Costs = $514</b><br/><br/><b>TOTAL COST OF PROJECT = $10,000</b><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>*If More Than Goal Is Reached:</b> If more than the Campaign Goal is reached, extra funds will go to the following additional costs: Photoshoot &amp; Makeup Artist for Cover of New EP ($300-$500); Printing of New EP ($300 for 100 EP's), Digital Distribution to iTunes, etc ($50); Video Shoots &amp; Makeup Artists for Videos for each of the 5 songs ($300-$500 per video).  </p>
<p><b>*If Goal Is Not Reached: </b>Currently, recording of the new EP will take place in the Spring of 2015 (March, April or May). If the Campaign Goal is not reached, all funds raised will be placed into a special savings account until the remaining amount can be raised, in which case a new recording date will be announced once total funds are raised for the project.<br/><br/></p>
