<p><br/>Hello, my name is Boris Kozma, and I’m super exited to showcase my project with you!</p>
<p>I’ve worked as a professional in the game industry (both virtual and in real life escape games) for 10 years now.  Making games, either virtual or in real life, is both my hobby and my passion.</p>
<p>Playing games like “Half Life 2”, “NieR:Automata”, “Metro 2033”, “STALKER”, and watching the anime “Girl’s Last Tour”, made me really appreciate the world building and lore of those worlds. I wanted to make a game where the focus is the world itself. So, instead of using your brawn, the main focus will be untangling the mysteries of New Atlantis, and the world itself.</p>
<p>This game project started right after I had to give up on a sidescroller I was working on with 2 of my friends. They didn’t have the time to continue working on it, and I didn’t have all the skills needed to carry it on my own. I decided to change that, and took a year and a half off work, in order to learn everything that I waslacking.</p>
<p>This project is the result of that labor, and I’d love to see it grow into a full-fledgedgame.</p>

<p>We don't think there is anyone who didn't like to play catch as a child. The excitement, the thrill and the adrenaline that came from chasing or running away from someone is deeply engraved into the memory of
every one of us, and it doesn't matter if you were good at it or not so much.</p>

During the past year, we thought a lot about how the times had changed and many of
us became ""couch potatoes"" - playing Angry Birds and other such games that are
basically just clicking the mobile device screen again and again. Mobile devices do empower our lives, but what about living?</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p>Wouldn't it be really cool to play catch again, but better, using your mobile device for a much more exciting experience!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Well, its not a dream anymore!</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>We've created it</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>It's call <i>SHIFT</i> and it F**KING ROCKS</b></p>

<p>We have a clear target for this campaign - Asking you to assists us in finalizing and launching <b><i>Shift</i></b> worldwide - the most exciting location based mobile game ever. We founded Augmented Games with a vision - To be the #1 mobile gaming company that builds these new types of games.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: left;""><b>What can I be? </b></h2>In <i><b>Shift </b></i>you can play as a <b>hunter</b> or an <b>escapee</b>. The hunter's goal is to capture the escapee, in the real world, and the escapee's goal is to avoid being captured by the hunter.<strong style=""background-color: initial;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1372526/files/20150410125156-HuntEscape.jpg?1428695516"" src="""" style=""""/></strong> </div><div><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;"">Who can my opponent be?</b></div><div>

<h2 style=""text-align: left;""><b>And how do I play?</b></h2>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As simple as that - the hunter's mission is to physically arrive within a reasonable distance (approximately 30yd) of the escapee while staying in the game zone and time frame, while the escapee needs to get away from the hunter (again while staying in the game zone) </span></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: left;""><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center; background-color: initial;"">Its not that easy...</b></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: left;""></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Your exact location is never completely presented to your opponent. You need to engage the opponent, meaning to get physically closer, in order to figure out his exact location. On the other end, your opponent can act as well... he can confuse you about his location by moving faster with a skateboard, bicycle, electrical bikes, a car, a boat, a rocketeer, a balloon, an airplane.. (yeah OK, I got too much excited here..)</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Working in software for a long long (long) time. Began working with Android in 2008 (yes, when the first device was a big phone shaped like banana! or not...) and even started and owned a mobile development company with many geeky developers who develop hundreds of cool games &amp; apps.<br/></p>

 ****************************************************************************


We don't think there is anyone who didn't like to play catch as a child. The excitement, the thrill and the adrenaline that came from chasing or running away from someone is deeply engraved into the memory of
every one of us, and it doesn't matter if you were good at it or not so much.

During the past year, we thought a lot about how the times had changed and many of
us became ""couch potatoes"" - playing Angry Birds and other such games that are
basically just clicking the mobile device screen again and again. Mobile devices do empower our lives, but what about living?
Wouldn't it be really cool to play catch again, but better, using your mobile device for a much more exciting experience!
Well, its not a dream anymore!
We've created it
It's call SHIFT and it F**KING ROCKS


Press here to download Shift beta from Google Play



For any question please contact us via - indiegogo@aug-games.com





We have a clear target for this campaign - Asking you to assists us in finalizing and launching Shift worldwide - the most exciting location based mobile game ever. We founded Augmented Games with a vision - To be the #1 mobile gaming company that builds these new types of games.

What can I be? In Shift you can play as a hunter or an escapee. The hunter's goal is to capture the escapee, in the real world, and the escapee's goal is to avoid being captured by the hunter. Who can my opponent be?
Shift  automatically match's you with available players that are  around you and allows you start playing. You can always create your own private\customized game and invite your friends to play (Facebook or whatever). 




And how do I play?

As simple as that - the hunter's mission is to physically arrive within a reasonable distance (approximately 30yd) of the escapee while staying in the game zone and time frame, while the escapee needs to get away from the hunter (again while staying in the game zone) 



Its not that easy...

Your exact location is never completely presented to your opponent. You need to engage the opponent, meaning to get physically closer, in order to figure out his exact location. On the other end, your opponent can act as well... he can confuse you about his location by moving faster with a skateboard, bicycle, electrical bikes, a car, a boat, a rocketeer, a balloon, an airplane.. (yeah OK, I got too much excited here..)

What else?
Shift has a secret back-end intelligent agency that assist's you by providing real-time information about the opponent and his actions, like his approximate location, actions that he does, his status and more... This will help you to know how to act in the game itself. During the game you can also chat and send pictures to your opponent. 








Shift  was created with major assistance of ""Shifts' Community"" in our area - and we desire to expand this community as much as we can. 
By joining our community you help to expand it and will assist us in creating the best game ever - this will be our personal fulfillment.
We promise the community that Shift is going to be FREE FOR EVERYONE. We will also publish what we call ""Shift's Journey Diary"" - around once a week. The diary will include updates about our work and most importantly polls with you guys about major features, designs and capabilities that we wish to include in the game. 

Creating complex games like Shift is a serious mission that needs professional care from developers, graphic designers and more... You can be sure that 100% of the funds we raise will be fully dedicated to Shift. 





So - Whats next? We really hope that you are able to help us by FUNDING, but there are also other ways that will help. SHARING the campaign with everyone, FOLLOWING us here on Indiegogo & other social networks (see the bottom of this page) and of course DOWNLOADING THE GAME FROM GOOGLE PLAY, GETTING UP, PLAYING WITH PEOPLE AROUND YOU AND LETTING US KNOW HOW WE CAN MAKE IT BETTER.











Working in software for a long long (long) time. Began working with Android in 2008 (yes, when the first device was a big phone shaped like banana! or not...) and even started and owned a mobile development company with many geeky developers who develop hundreds of cool games & apps.


Shachar met Dror when they worked together in that mobile development shop. Dror was seeking for geeky developers and Shachar was by no doubt the geekiest. Although geeky, he runs really really fast! and has never lost a single game of Shift to Dror. 
                                                                Has a head. :-)


We founded Augmented Games in early 2014, and currently, all three of us are investing all our time and are fully dedicated to the start-up. We are ""Bootstrapped"" (meaning we are self funded and have no other incomes), working from Shachar's Garage and our resources are going end soon :(



We like Shachar's garage very much, and spend many hours there. Sometimes we need to get up and go test our cool new features out
on the streets, where we run like crazy and never (ever!) capture Shachar. 



Just
imagine Shift with awesome features like playing in groups, using power-ups or even
playing against your friends for real money! 



Shift's beta version is now ready! 
You can download and play it NOW (US, Canada, UK and Israel)! Its AWESOME! 
Press here to download Shift beta from Google Play

The first funding round (30,000$) will help us to:


Launch Shift Worldwide (currently available only in US,Canada, UK and Israel)
Polish the game
Extend Shift's community
And add cool new features like:

Leader-boards - local and worldwide
Scoring systems
Achievements 

badges and trophies 


If we are successful with the fundraising, we will do our best to release the new Shift version during August 2015.

The Meet & Greet (& Hunt)

<p>The game mainly designed to reduce inner stress by encourage people to scream without limit, later on the idea evolved ,I found its awesome to be played outside using the surrounding noise in different scenario .</p>
<p>Just start the game and play it normally like any other shooter game , however, once you feel like you want more power, just do any of the following :</p>
<ul>
<li>Scream loud say NOOOOOOOO or just say no gently, any noise which is detected by your microphone will has an effect</li>
<li>You can play it while you play your favorite music next to you.</li>
<li>Play it outside while you waiting for your school bus.</li>
<li>Long flights, car rides and train travels.</li>
<li>Boring lectures and parties .</li>
<li>While having lunch at noise restaurant and you waiting for your order.</li>
<li>There is infinite way after all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the market is quite saturated with bullet shooter games, I added the noise detection feature to make it the only one on the market . this encourage folks to play it more frequently outside whenever they want to waste their time for any reason instead of picking those boring puzzle games. or when being stressed like me.</p>

<p>The scale of the projectiles and their colors represent how strong is the noise around you following thermal color range rule. Red is normal, violet is maximum that main weapon can reach. I did it this way for certain reason, From UX prospective, I dont want to have many UI element during gameplay .</p>

<p>But wait, this only 40% of the total noise that your mic can receive , the other 60% including lighting Strikes and energy field between your bullets and more awesome effects and power up will be added . feel free to comment with suggestion, bec I want to make this game a community driven too .<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543247172/f2xsaxvoi08ea3ga5ru6.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>I've Huawei G8 which is 3 years old device, and the game run smoothly on 30 fps while Mobile HDR and Post processing are enabled .  and this is the only device I have . also I tested on Samsung Galaxy C9 and the game run 60fps . the game uses Unreal Engine Technology.</p>
<p>While I care about visual look of my game, I will keep the graphic setting customized so it become playable on most devices.  thats why I need more devices to test the game.</p>

<p><i><strong><u>For Risks</u> :</strong></i></p>
<p>I already took the following risks :</p>
<ul>
<li>I had an interview for possible job and I suppose to get their final decision after 3 days from the day of interview  , but I made my decision to push all I've left to this project and apologized to them before they even telling me their final decision while I was really looking for any job to cover my education fees , what could be more risky than this , beside they may reject me too , who knows .</li>
<li>I missed my mid-terms exams last weeks at 19.11.2018, didnt attend 95% of classes to focus, polish and prepare my campaign on Indiegogo , but good thing that I still have 2 months to recap what I've missed at university starting at december.</li>
<li>I set the funding goal as ""Fixed Goal"" . while I need any cash to cover my education fees, flexible funding would be the ideal solution, but I didnt choose this path, bec I want to fulfill my promise and bring this game to life, and hardware requirement is not that cheap especially iOS and Mac solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><i><strong>Challenges</strong></i></u> :</p>
<p>The real challenge is Myself , facing high level of stress in daily basis is something that sucks anyone happiness, your life become slow in all aspect , thats the main reason I developed this game , when I shout or singing loud like retarded while playing , it makes me feel much better , not perfect solution, but it works.</p>
<p>But dont worry , once I open the game development agile board , I become suddenly forget about anything around and melt down inside the project whenever I feel down, this game revives me , so you all have to be sure that I will not cool down until this game is out however long it will take</p>
<p>I always say, Die for your dream and it will revive you .</p>

<p>If you cant contribute to this project but you liked the idea, just simply share it on facebook, twitter or whatever social media you use, if this campaign went viral and everyone contribute by 5$ will be enough , thats best thing you can do :))</p>

you will find a native unreal engine icon game installed with name ""Unreal Forces"" installed on your device .
Start the game.

Note:

There is a bug where the mic only works for first time when you start the game, if you closed the game and want to restart it, make sure you disable the mic permission manually first .
This demo is on very hard level, so make sure you do some real noise :D
This is demo version, you should expect it may be not be stable on your device .



The game mainly designed to reduce inner stress by encourage people to scream without limit, later on the idea evolved ,I found its awesome to be played outside using the surrounding noise in different scenario .
Just start the game and play it normally like any other shooter game , however, once you feel like you want more power, just do any of the following :

Scream loud say NOOOOOOOO or just say no gently, any noise which is detected by your microphone will has an effect
You can play it while you play your favorite music next to you.
Play it outside while you waiting for your school bus.
Long flights, car rides and train travels.
Boring lectures and parties .
While having lunch at noise restaurant and you waiting for your order.
There is infinite way after all.

Since the market is quite saturated with bullet shooter games, I added the noise detection feature to make it the only one on the market . this encourage folks to play it more frequently outside whenever they want to waste their time for any reason instead of picking those boring puzzle games. or when being stressed like me.


The scale of the projectiles and their colors represent how strong is the noise around you following thermal color range rule. Red is normal, violet is maximum that main weapon can reach. I did it this way for certain reason, From UX prospective, I dont want to have many UI element during gameplay .

But wait, this only 40% of the total noise that your mic can receive , the other 60% including lighting Strikes and energy field between your bullets and more awesome effects and power up will be added . feel free to comment with suggestion, bec I want to make this game a community driven too .

I've Huawei G8 which is 3 years old device, and the game run smoothly on 30 fps while Mobile HDR and Post processing are enabled .  and this is the only device I have . also I tested on Samsung Galaxy C9 and the game run 60fps . the game uses Unreal Engine Technology.
While I care about visual look of my game, I will keep the graphic setting customized so it become playable on most devices.  thats why I need more devices to test the game.

CG Shot for the boss of the first level

Level 1 boss - In Engine

Main Ship ""just a sample, not final one""

Enemy Ship - In Engine

Enemy ship another variation - In Engine

Turret CG Shot


Low Poly Turret in game engine - In Engine

THIS IS THE LEVEL ONE WORLD TILES - In Engine

Enemy boss unreal engine blueprint 


8 levels with 3 levels of difficulties with awesome story line, each level will have its own theme, its own boss, and its fully 3D stunning environment , I'm aiming to bring Unreal Engine® visual power to mobile platform while I completely understand the limitation of mobile hardware .
Keep in mind that the number of levels may increase or decrease based on the deadline of release of the game bec after all I'm planning to add more levels even after release .

I've Introduced the game for first time at Slovenia Game Conference at October 2018, I called it that time Screaming Jet, and I got very +ve feedback from everyone, even from waiters which is completely surprised me, I dont think they were compliment me by anyway since they dont know me  , thats what encouraged me to take it to 2nd level making it official and crowdfund it. especially after I left my job on August 2018 .
I've prepared a demo version that is playable on controllers so everyone could try it during conference . this is me while showing the game to one of the visitors.

Based on the ads explanation, you have to expect decent rewards to encourage you to watch an ad .

This game build with love not greed , and I'm a gamer and will never add anything that bother me personally when I play a video game, even if its a mobile game.

<p><em>I have been drawn to these stories my entire life. These experiences have been told by people who believed in what they saw, what they experienced.

<p>Read the descriptions below from real people and there experiences with creatures they could not comprehend or understand!</p>
<p><strong>MOTHMAN</strong><br/><em>November 15, 1966 Point Pleasant, West Virginia</em></p>
<p>While driving through an abandoned munitions dump ""locally known as the TNT area,"" Linda Scarberry, her husband Roger and another couple spotted a pair of glowing red eyes, two inches wide and six inches apart attached to something that was ""shaped like a man, but bigger...maybe six or seven feet tall, and it had big wings folded against its back."" Roger accelerated their vehicle trying to escape from the creature. Much to the couples' horror, ""Mothman"" gave case, squeaking audibly as it reached speeds over 100mph. The flying monster ended pursuit only as the car neared town.</p>
<p><strong>THE JERSEY DEVIL</strong><br/><em>December 1993 Pine Barrens, New Jersey</em></p>
<p>Forest Ranger John Irwin was driving alongside the Mullica River in southern New Jersey when he found the road blocked by a creature. Irwin describes the monster as a six foot tall bipedal animal with horns and dark fur. The ranger and ""The Jersey Devil"" stared at each other for several minutes before the creature fled into the woods.</p>
<p><em>Origin: Pine Barrens 1730</em><br/>The mistress of a British soldier known as ""Mother Leeds"" went into labor with her 13th child. During the delivery she suffered agonizing pain and cursed the child, wishing it out of her body. As the hateful words faded from her lips the Jersey Devil slithered out of her womb and into the world.</p>
<p><strong>CHUPACABRA</strong></p>
<p><em>August 1995 Cano' Vanas, Puerto Rico</em></p>
<p>At 4pm Madelyne Tolentino noticed that the driver of a vehicle parked in front of her house appeared frightened. As she approached the large front window she saw a creature walking upright in front of her house with its arms outstretched. At that point she screamed, sending her mother outside of the house to chase the creature. The monster took off in a hopping motion toward the nearby woods.</p>
<p>A typical Chupacabra is described as four to six feet in height covered in short fine grey hair with dark spots on the creature's back. Its powerful legs and long arms end in hands containing three to four long narrow fingers ending in claws. A series of protruding spikes run along the creature’s spine.</p>
<p><strong>THE MISSOURI MONSTER</strong></p>
<p><em>July 11, 1972 Louisiana, Missouri</em></p>
<p>Eight year old Terry Harrison was playing in the backyard when a creature appeared, splatted with blood, carrying a dog under its arm. The creature was luckily driven away by the screams of his eight year old sister Doris, who had just stepped out into the yard.</p>
<p>""Momo"" is typically described as a creature six to seven feet tall, its body covered entirely in black hair. Manlike in appearance and stance, the creature is often referred to as the ""Eastern Bigfoot.""</p>

<p>I have been fortunate to work in industries that I've been passion about my entire life. The first 5 of my 15 years were spent working for the toy industry as a designer. I was an action figure designer, can you believe that! Those were great years for me, spent with some truly talented artists working on what I loved; action figure toy lines.

Since then I've moved to another studio and just released a game called ""XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"" where I spent the last 4 years as Lead Level Designer.

<h3>Who is this guy?</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Ruari O'Sullivan, aka <a href=""https://twitter.com/randomnine"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">randomnine</a>. I used to work for Frontier Developments Ltd. Two years ago I decided to take the money I'd saved up, strike out for myself and go indie.</p>
<p>Through 2011 I did several smaller games. I made <a href=""http://wootfu.com/beacon/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beacon</a>, a 15-minute platformer in space. I made <a href=""http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/580130"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fear Is Vigilance</a>, a game about punching people who don't have safety alarms until they're scared enough to take safety alarms. Both were covered <a href=""http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/randomnine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">on Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a>; Fear Is Vigilance was sponsored by Newgrounds. I also did some contract work, a few small mods like <a href=""http://distractionware.com/blog/2011/08/featured-vvvvvv-level-%E2%80%9Cthe-tower-of-power%E2%80%9D-by-randomnine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this custom level for VVVVVV</a>, and most importantly here helped out with later versions of <a href=""http://tametick.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ido Yehieli's</a> <a href=""http://cardinalquest.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cardinal Quest</a>. </p>
<p>It was a fun year, if a bit scattered. I worked on lots of small projects and managed to stay afloat - but I want to do something bigger. I asked Ido what he thought about making a full-blown sequel to Cardinal Quest. He said yes!</p>
<p> <img alt=""CQ2 screenshot: ranger fighting in town"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://wootfu.com/ul/cq/indiegogo/cq2_rangering.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What's the game about?</h3>
<p>Cardinal Quest 1 was a streamlined turn-based dungeon crawler. Cardinal Quest 2 is bigger, better and deeper; you've got way more control over how you make your character and the game's procedurally-generated environments and challenges are much more varied.</p>
<p>It's had a massive interface overhaul to make it sleeker and easier to play, including a snap-decision interface system to present you the important choices and get rid of fussy inventory management. The biggest new feature is the talent system - a range of unique upgrades for each of the six character classes which helps you build every character up in their own uniquely overpowered way.</p>
<p>I've been working on Cardinal Quest 2 since January. I think it's pretty fun already (but please, download the demo and judge for yourself!). However, I want it to be BETTER and THE MOST AWESOME IT CAN POSSIBLY BE.</p>
<p>I want to make it three chapters long, with unique environments, monsters, bosses and challenges in each. I want to flesh it out with little mini-sidequests. I want to add some real surprises in; rare items that'll really change your game when you find them. Most of all, I want to bring people in to completely redo the art, extend CQ1's soundtrack with all-new music just for CQ2. Maybe even to overhaul the sound and develop the setting.</p>
<p>Problem is... I'm broke!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>So here's the deal.</h3>
<p>You can play the demo of the current version, right now, for free. Go on - play it! Then come back.</p>
<p>If you pledge a little, you'll get the game for Windows, Mac or Linux at a discount when it comes out. If you want to continue your game before then, pledge a bit more and you'll <strong>get direct beta access</strong> <strong>within 24 hours</strong>. You'll get the entirety of the game's first chapter as it stands; you'll also get regular updates as the game improves, with full talent trees and improvements to the Ranger, Pugilist and Paladin coming up soon. You'll be able to see it taking shape and tell me how to make more fun for you.</p>

Play the demo!



Windows (EXE)



Mac (DMG)



Linux (DEB)

That's why you're here, right? :D
If you'd like a quicker look at the game, check out the gameplay trailer.
 
Who is this guy?
Hi! I'm Ruari O'Sullivan, aka randomnine. I used to work for Frontier Developments Ltd. Two years ago I decided to take the money I'd saved up, strike out for myself and go indie.
Through 2011 I did several smaller games. I made Beacon, a 15-minute platformer in space. I made Fear Is Vigilance, a game about punching people who don't have safety alarms until they're scared enough to take safety alarms. Both were covered on Rock, Paper, Shotgun; Fear Is Vigilance was sponsored by Newgrounds. I also did some contract work, a few small mods like this custom level for VVVVVV, and most importantly here helped out with later versions of Ido Yehieli's Cardinal Quest. 
It was a fun year, if a bit scattered. I worked on lots of small projects and managed to stay afloat - but I want to do something bigger. I asked Ido what he thought about making a full-blown sequel to Cardinal Quest. He said yes!
 
What's the game about?
Cardinal Quest 1 was a streamlined turn-based dungeon crawler. Cardinal Quest 2 is bigger, better and deeper; you've got way more control over how you make your character and the game's procedurally-generated environments and challenges are much more varied.
It's had a massive interface overhaul to make it sleeker and easier to play, including a snap-decision interface system to present you the important choices and get rid of fussy inventory management. The biggest new feature is the talent system - a range of unique upgrades for each of the six character classes which helps you build every character up in their own uniquely overpowered way.
I've been working on Cardinal Quest 2 since January. I think it's pretty fun already (but please, download the demo and judge for yourself!). However, I want it to be BETTER and THE MOST AWESOME IT CAN POSSIBLY BE.
I want to make it three chapters long, with unique environments, monsters, bosses and challenges in each. I want to flesh it out with little mini-sidequests. I want to add some real surprises in; rare items that'll really change your game when you find them. Most of all, I want to bring people in to completely redo the art, extend CQ1's soundtrack with all-new music just for CQ2. Maybe even to overhaul the sound and develop the setting.
Problem is... I'm broke!
 
So here's the deal.
You can play the demo of the current version, right now, for free. Go on - play it! Then come back.
If you pledge a little, you'll get the game for Windows, Mac or Linux at a discount when it comes out. If you want to continue your game before then, pledge a bit more and you'll get direct beta access within 24 hours. You'll get the entirety of the game's first chapter as it stands; you'll also get regular updates as the game improves, with full talent trees and improvements to the Ranger, Pugilist and Paladin coming up soon. You'll be able to see it taking shape and tell me how to make more fun for you.
Throw in a bit more and you'll get the first game's soundtrack, plus CQ2's once it's commissioned. Go further and there's a beta access bundle that gets you access for your friends at a discount.
If you bought Cardinal Quest 1 before December 8th 2011: as we've announced before, you'll get Cardinal Quest 2 for free - because you're awesome and we love you. If you pledge for beta access anyway, get in touch and we'll throw in the soundtracks gratis.
 
What will the money be used for?
Making the game! It'll be done by March 2013 at the latest - possibly sooner - and it'll be a heck of a lot better than it is now.
After Indiegogo and payment processing fees are deducted, here's where the money's going:

$8,500 art budget to redo all game artwork at a higher resolution
$6,000 programming budget to make the game much, much bigger
$2,000 music budget to expand the soundtrack
$1,500 in fees, software, hardware, sound effects and general contingencies
This is a fixed funding campaign. If it doesn't clear the goal then your money will be refunded. I'll then have to wrap up the game fairly quickly, put it out as it is now - one chapter long, with low-resolution artwork. It'll be OK, but with your help I think it could be so much more.
 
Awesome! I've pledged. How else can I help?
Well, Cardinal Quest 2 is on Greenlight. Vote it up! If it gets on Steam, all preorders will come with Steam keys as well as a DRM-free alternative.
If you pledged $25 or more, you'll receive an email with a link to beta downloads within 24 hours. Please bear with me - I need to go through the list once or twice a day and send out the emails manually, it's not automated. :)
Finally - tell everyone you know! Every single dollar pledged will help make the game you're getting better, so spread the word.

<h2>Saga of Pandoria</h2>
<p>Hello World, this is Martin from Team Monkey. Previously I had the chance to participate in titles such as ""Crysis"" or ""Ankh"", but today I am glad to work together with my mates at Team Monkey on the game of our dreams: Saga of Pandoria.</p>
<p><br/>Despite what you might think, we are actually only a small indie game development team of less than 5 people across the globe working on this game in our spare time.</p>
<p><br/>Saga of Pandoria is (previously known as ""Return to Mana"") is a 3 player COOP Action RPG in a unique fantasy environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Key features of the game<br/><br/>

<p><strong>Handcrafted unique fantasy environment with much love for detail.</strong></p>

<h2>Why we need your help</h2>
</div>
<div>Here is in short the answer to <em>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP</em>:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Licence Fee</strong><br/><strong>In order to make use of the full features of the SOURCE engine and turn this game into a standalone version, we need to form a licence agreement with VALVE. These licence fees will require the vast majority of the funds.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Server costs.<br/>For many years we have been working on this title already, facing continuous expenses for not only the main website but also our internal development servers.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Game content / Programming<br/>Although the content for the first episode is almost finished, we are hoping to get even more content into the game.</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Although the Story mode is already up and running, the ""core"" of the game principle, the XP system is not up and running yet. We will need many hours of programming to finalize this most important element of the game.</strong></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Making it DRM free.<br/>We want to deliver this game to you DRM free on your hard drive. No third party publisher / software will limit your unlimited right to enjoy this game.</strong></p>

Hello World, this is Martin from Team Monkey. Previously I had the chance to participate in titles such as ""Crysis"" or ""Ankh"", but today I am glad to work together with my mates at Team Monkey on the game of our dreams: Saga of Pandoria.
Despite what you might think, we are actually only a small indie game development team of less than 5 people across the globe working on this game in our spare time.
Saga of Pandoria is (previously known as ""Return to Mana"") is a 3 player COOP Action RPG in a unique fantasy environment.
 
Key features of the game



Homage to SNES action RPG classics


3 Player Coop STORY Mode across LAN or Internet


Realtime Battlesystem (Blocking, Evasion, Combos)


Realtime Magic & Item system


Continuous leveling of both character and skills saved across games (Stored on local computer, similar to ""Diablo"")


Handcrafted unique fantasy environment with much love for detail.


 
Although the first episode of the game is almost finished, we decided to take our game to IndieGoGo to turn something GOOD into something GREAT.
If you read so far and you are still interested, please continue to find out WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:
 


Why we need your help

Here is in short the answer to WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:
 


Licence FeeIn order to make use of the full features of the SOURCE engine and turn this game into a standalone version, we need to form a licence agreement with VALVE. These licence fees will require the vast majority of the funds.


Server costs.For many years we have been working on this title already, facing continuous expenses for not only the main website but also our internal development servers.


Game content / ProgrammingAlthough the content for the first episode is almost finished, we are hoping to get even more content into the game.
Although the Story mode is already up and running, the ""core"" of the game principle, the XP system is not up and running yet. We will need many hours of programming to finalize this most important element of the game.


Making it DRM free.We want to deliver this game to you DRM free on your hard drive. No third party publisher / software will limit your unlimited right to enjoy this game.


 

What You will get
One of the most unique game titles in recent history plus:


Early access to your own digital copy.


Standalone game with full access of the SOURCE engine features.


Special features such as game soundtrack or strategy/monster guide.


More content in the game than already included. More monsters to beat, more levels to reach, more islands to visit.


DRM free game with no third party limiting your gaming experience.

anything in the world. This girl is in the haven. He could be
anywhere without her, but still feel like in hell, so he decides to escape. His escaping is adventurous, full of enemies, dangers and potential. His story is told by

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We believe that game
experience depends on not only the technical part, but the atmosphere and the

meet a lot of exciting elements trying to kill you. Some enemies can move in the
air in a regular shaped path. Some are hidden until you get close. Some
elements appear only when you touch another element and some disappear after
leaving it. The goal is complete levels more quickly with less dead-count while
collecting more points.</p>

<p><b>tl;dr: </b>If you want a box, get the <b>O1: Lieutenant</b>-perk or better.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What is this?</b></p>
<p>Traveller LIFTOFF is a starter set for the Traveller RPG made for young
players and designed around a ""plug-and-play"" mentality that lets you
start adventuring right along. Just grab a few friends, generate your
characters, and LIFTOFF!</p>
<p>Created by 13Mann with support from Mongoose and many prominent Traveller artists,
LIFTOFF is made for the next generation of Traveller players – and hence: the
perfect gift any Traveller parent can give to his or her kids. Inside the box,
new players will find everything they need to play, while experienced players,
too, will find contents like the full-color Charted Space map and full-colour deck
plans of popular Traveller starships both useful and incredibly ""must have"".</p>
<p><b>Who is 13Mann?</b></p>
<p>We are the German license holder for both Mongoose's Traveller RPG and Marc
Miller's Traveller5. Beyond that, we publish several other tabletop roleplaying
games – and we have had amazing success with our own ABOREA™ product line, a
fantasy RPG targeted at young players which serves us as an introduction to the
(rather complex) Rolemaster system.</p>
<p>We have seen 12 year olds playing ABOREA™ games with enthusiasm at toy trade
fairs and being swayed by the ‘new and innovative’ game concepts. And we are
very confident this can be done for Traveller as well.</p>
<p><b>Why crowdfunding?</b></p>
<p>As some of you may know, we at 13Mann believe in quality products and doing
so comes with high initial costs. If we were to provide all the money upfront,
it would be too much of a financial risk. Your support helps us achieve
something no publisher (at least no Traveller publisher) would dare.</p>
<p>We predominantly produce for the German market but here we have the rare
opportunity to work with Mongoose on a Traveller Starter Set both in English
and German.</p>
<p><b>Why is this such a great opportunity?</b></p>
<p>LIFTOFF will introduce the classic and timeless awesomeness of Traveller to
a new generation. The basic rules – which are a condensed and simplified
version of the Mongoose rules – have already been written and are in a constant
state of playtesting, re-evaluation and further simplification and fine-tuning --
just download and read the latest rules version <a href=""https://www.13mann.com/index.php/en/traveller-starter-set/downloads"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>We want to make absolutely sure that the LIFTOFF rules deliver the fastest,
smoothest, easiest and yet unmistakeably ""Traveller"" game experience
possible -- AND at the same time give experienced players loads .of material
they can use at their own gaming table.</p>
<p><b>What will you be getting?</b></p>
<p>The basic version of the LIFTOFF box will contain the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Players’ Handbook
     (about 60 pages) will all the rules required for easy play, including
     ready-to-play characters. You can download the text for the Players’
     Handbook <a href=""http://www.13mann.com/index.php/en/traveller-starter-set/downloads?download=209:traveller-player-s-handbook-v1-2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>here</span></a>
</li>
<li>a Referee’s Handbook
     containing all the important background, an introduction to referee’s job,
     a guide to the Traveller universe and some ready-to-play NPCs. You can
     download the text for the Referee’s Handbook <a href=""http://www.13mann.com/index.php/en/traveller-starter-set/downloads?download=208:traveller-referee-s-handbook-v1-2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>here</span></a>
</li>
<li>an Adventure Handbook,
     containing 6 adventures which can be played as continuous session or as a
     string of simple 2h sessions, perfect for rainy afternoons, short
     introductions or convention play. It will see the characters develop their
     contacts while following a mission to uncover the truth about what
     happened to Outpost 14. You can download the text for the first adventure <a href=""http://www.13mann.com/index.php/en/traveller-starter-set/downloads?download=207:adventures-v1-0"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>here</span></a> (we don’t

</li>
</ul><p>
</p><ul>
<li>a pack of six cheat sheets for
     players, so they (and probably the referee, too) have the most important
     rules at a glance</li>

</li>
</ul><p>That’s all contained in the box and if you were to buy
the box at your FLGS or from an online store, this is all you will get (there
won’t be any individual perks or stretch goals).</p>
<p><b>What will it look like?</b></p>
<p>You can see
a sample layout with some real text and real illustrations <a href=""http://www.13mann.com/index.php/en/traveller-starter-set/downloads?download=211:liftoff-sample-layout"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>English or German?</b></p><p>We will produce both, an English and a German version of Traveller Liftoff. English will be the default language. If you want a German language version, please let us know in your selected perk comment section.<b><br/></b></p><p><b>Can I order additional material from the box?<br/></b></p><p>You want additional Players' Handbooks or maps? No problem. Simply add 6 EUR for each single item you want to add and state in your perk comments, what you want. If you order more than 5 items, please consider adding 10 EUR shipping costs for every 5 articles beyond the first 5. You have to select the <b>E3: Sergeant</b>-perk or better to be eligible for ordering. If you choose <b>O5: Colonel</b> or above, you don't need to include additional shipping costs.<br/></p><p><b>Can I order additional boxes?</b></p><p>Yes, you can but unfortunately the shipping costs don't scale that well. Actually, they scale bad. If you just want one additional box we recommend simply choosing the same perk again. However, if you want more then one additional box, please add 15 EUR shipping costs (yes, it scales that bad) and then 20 EUR per additional box you want to order. You have to select the <b>O1: Lieutenant</b>-perk or better to be eligible for ordering. However, if you truly want to order multiple boxes (for your children, grandchildren, a gift for young boys and girls) we recommend you choose <b>O5: Colonel</b> or above. Then you don't need to include additional shipping costs and can order as many boxes as you want for 20 EUR each.<br/></p><p><b>What are our stretch goals?</b></p>
<p>The more people participate in this crowdfunding, the
better for everyone. So tell your friends and your fellow gamers about it. Most
stretch goals will feature an additional deck plan, like the one for the Free
Trader until all ships featured in the box are covered. It will also include
additional adventures. And we are particularly eager to see solo adventures come
to life. Our stretch goals go in steps of 25,000 EUR. </p>

</ul><p><b>What’s the timeline?</b></p>
<p>This crowdfunding will end on October 1, 2014. If we reached our funding
goal, the next steps will be the creation of additional artwork and translation
of English texts to German (for our German supporters). This will take about a
month.</p>
<p>Sometime in early November we will commence our Layout work and final
editing. Printing should start in mid-December and (taking Christmas holidays
into account) finish early February, at which point we will transport the boxes
and additional materials to our distributor of choice (Mongoose) who will do
the international shipping to you folks. Those in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland will receive a parcel from 13Mann directly. Depending on where you
are, and your local customs officers, and if everything goes according to plan,
your parcel should arrive around the end of March, early April 2015.</p>
<p><b>What if you were to buy this later in a shop?</b></p>
<p>You may spot a
LIFTOFF box in your FLGS or online shop of choice. The box will only feature
the contents listed under “What will you be getting?”. None of the stretch
goals will be included (which you <i>may</i>
be able to purchase for some additional money however), and certainly none of
the individual rewards. So yes, you do get the best value for money here.</p>
<p><b>What happens if LIFTOFF doesn’t get funded?</b></p>
<p>We do want to share our dream of introducing new and
young players to Traveller, but at the same time we have to be realistic. So
what happens, if we don’t reach our funding goal? Indiegogo will automatically
return your investment. Of course it also means there won’t be a LIFTOFF box.</p>
<p>However, we will keep the Players’ Handbook and the
Referee’s Handbook as plain text documents available for download at 13Mann’s
website. No further changes will be made to the documents though and there
won’t be any illustrations or deckplans available.</p>
<p><b>Shipping costs included</b></p>
<p>All
individual reward levels that require us shipping boxes and other materials to
you, already include shipping and packaging costs if you live within the EU or
North America.</p>
<p><b>International delivery and customs duty</b></p>
<p>We will ship
worldwide and all our individual reward levels contain shipping costs to the EU, Europe (outside EU),
and North America. If you want your parcel shipped outside this area, we have
to ask for an additional 15 EUR on your perk level.</p>
<p>As we will
be shipping from inside the EU, your local customs may require you to pay additional
customs duty. Each country has its own regulations and tariffs regarding
customs duty, so it is impossible for us to include it in the perk levels.</p>
<p><b>What if I am a retailer/merchant?</b></p>
<p>If you have
a gaming store or are a retailer and want to bulk order (20+ units), you can
contact us at <a href=""mailto:vertrieb@13mann.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vertrieb@13mann.de</a> for
individual pricing plans.</p>

We have seen 12 year olds playing ABOREA™ games with enthusiasm at toy trade
fairs and being swayed by the ‘new and innovative’ game concepts. And we are
very confident this can be done for Traveller as well.
Why crowdfunding?
As some of you may know, we at 13Mann believe in quality products and doing
so comes with high initial costs. If we were to provide all the money upfront,
it would be too much of a financial risk. Your support helps us achieve
something no publisher (at least no Traveller publisher) would dare.
We predominantly produce for the German market but here we have the rare
opportunity to work with Mongoose on a Traveller Starter Set both in English
and German.
Why is this such a great opportunity?
LIFTOFF will introduce the classic and timeless awesomeness of Traveller to
a new generation. The basic rules – which are a condensed and simplified
version of the Mongoose rules – have already been written and are in a constant
state of playtesting, re-evaluation and further simplification and fine-tuning --
just download and read the latest rules version here.
We want to make absolutely sure that the LIFTOFF rules deliver the fastest,
smoothest, easiest and yet unmistakeably ""Traveller"" game experience
possible -- AND at the same time give experienced players loads .of material
they can use at their own gaming table.
What will you be getting?
The basic version of the LIFTOFF box will contain the
following:

a Players’ Handbook
     (about 60 pages) will all the rules required for easy play, including
     ready-to-play characters. You can download the text for the Players’
     Handbook here

a Referee’s Handbook
     containing all the important background, an introduction to referee’s job,
     a guide to the Traveller universe and some ready-to-play NPCs. You can
     download the text for the Referee’s Handbook here

an Adventure Handbook,
     containing 6 adventures which can be played as continuous session or as a
     string of simple 2h sessions, perfect for rainy afternoons, short
     introductions or convention play. It will see the characters develop their
     contacts while following a mission to uncover the truth about what
     happened to Outpost 14. You can download the text for the first adventure here (we don’t
     want to spoil everything)



a pack of six cheat sheets for
     players, so they (and probably the referee, too) have the most important
     rules at a glance
an A2 sized (16.5 × 23.4
     inches or 42.0 × 59.4 cm for those of you on the metric system) full colour
     map of Charted Space 

an A2 sized full coloured
     deck plan of a Free Trader

That’s all contained in the box and if you were to buy
the box at your FLGS or from an online store, this is all you will get (there
won’t be any individual perks or stretch goals).
What will it look like?
You can see
a sample layout with some real text and real illustrations here.
English or German?We will produce both, an English and a German version of Traveller Liftoff. English will be the default language. If you want a German language version, please let us know in your selected perk comment section.Can I order additional material from the box?You want additional Players' Handbooks or maps? No problem. Simply add 6 EUR for each single item you want to add and state in your perk comments, what you want. If you order more than 5 items, please consider adding 10 EUR shipping costs for every 5 articles beyond the first 5. You have to select the E3: Sergeant-perk or better to be eligible for ordering. If you choose O5: Colonel or above, you don't need to include additional shipping costs.Can I order additional boxes?Yes, you can but unfortunately the shipping costs don't scale that well. Actually, they scale bad. If you just want one additional box we recommend simply choosing the same perk again. However, if you want more then one additional box, please add 15 EUR shipping costs (yes, it scales that bad) and then 20 EUR per additional box you want to order. You have to select the O1: Lieutenant-perk or better to be eligible for ordering. However, if you truly want to order multiple boxes (for your children, grandchildren, a gift for young boys and girls) we recommend you choose O5: Colonel or above. Then you don't need to include additional shipping costs and can order as many boxes as you want for 20 EUR each.What are our stretch goals?
The more people participate in this crowdfunding, the
better for everyone. So tell your friends and your fellow gamers about it. Most
stretch goals will feature an additional deck plan, like the one for the Free
Trader until all ships featured in the box are covered. It will also include
additional adventures. And we are particularly eager to see solo adventures come
to life. Our stretch goals go in steps of 25,000 EUR. 


125,000 EUR: Deck plan: Fighter &
Launch, Solo Adventure 1, Map of a Starport Class E


150,000 EUR: Deck plan: Scout, Character
Sheet Block, Map of a Starport Class D


175,000 EUR: Deck plan: Pinnace,
Additional Group Adventure 1, Map of a Starport Downport Class C


200,000 EUR: Referee's Screen, Token Set, Map of a Starport Highport Class C


225,000 EUR: Deck plan: Lab Ship, Solo
Adventure 2, Map of a Starport Downport Class B


250,000 EUR: Deck plan: Close Escort,
Additional Group Adventure 2, Map of a Starport Highport Class B


275,000 EUR: Deck plan: Subsidized
Merchant, Additional Group Adventures 3 + 4
What’s the timeline?
This crowdfunding will end on October 1, 2014. If we reached our funding
goal, the next steps will be the creation of additional artwork and translation
of English texts to German (for our German supporters). This will take about a
month.
Sometime in early November we will commence our Layout work and final
editing. Printing should start in mid-December and (taking Christmas holidays
into account) finish early February, at which point we will transport the boxes
and additional materials to our distributor of choice (Mongoose) who will do
the international shipping to you folks. Those in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland will receive a parcel from 13Mann directly. Depending on where you
are, and your local customs officers, and if everything goes according to plan,
your parcel should arrive around the end of March, early April 2015.
What if you were to buy this later in a shop?
You may spot a
LIFTOFF box in your FLGS or online shop of choice. The box will only feature
the contents listed under “What will you be getting?”. None of the stretch
goals will be included (which you may
be able to purchase for some additional money however), and certainly none of
the individual rewards. So yes, you do get the best value for money here.
What happens if LIFTOFF doesn’t get funded?
We do want to share our dream of introducing new and
young players to Traveller, but at the same time we have to be realistic. So
what happens, if we don’t reach our funding goal? Indiegogo will automatically
return your investment. Of course it also means there won’t be a LIFTOFF box.
However, we will keep the Players’ Handbook and the
Referee’s Handbook as plain text documents available for download at 13Mann’s
website. No further changes will be made to the documents though and there
won’t be any illustrations or deckplans available.
Shipping costs included
All
individual reward levels that require us shipping boxes and other materials to
you, already include shipping and packaging costs if you live within the EU or
North America.
International delivery and customs duty
We will ship
worldwide and all our individual reward levels contain shipping costs to the EU, Europe (outside EU),
and North America. If you want your parcel shipped outside this area, we have
to ask for an additional 15 EUR on your perk level.
As we will
be shipping from inside the EU, your local customs may require you to pay additional
customs duty. Each country has its own regulations and tariffs regarding
customs duty, so it is impossible for us to include it in the perk levels.
What if I am a retailer/merchant?
If you have
a gaming store or are a retailer and want to bulk order (20+ units), you can
contact us at vertrieb@13mann.de for
individual pricing plans.
13Mann will provide you with regular updates. Please join us in making this
happen!",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<br/><strong><strong></strong></strong>
</h3><h3><strong><strong>~ Introduction ~</strong></strong></h3><p>The
 Shogun's enemies have escaped! As a Ninja, you are tasked to capture 
them back. But beware! Your rival Ninjas are on the same task!</p>
<p>It's an all-out war to gain the Shogun's favor! Can you capture more enemies than your rivals?</p><strong>
</strong><p>Way
 of the Ninja: Capture the Shoguns Enemies!  is a card and
 dice game designed to be played by 1 up to 4 players of ages 12 years 
and above and can be played for a minimum of 30 minutes and onwards.</p>
<p>The game is designed like a basic Role Playing Game wherein a player 
goes from location to location, attempting to defeat all enemy bosses 
while maintaining a set life points, using coins, items, and captured 
small enemies along the way. The
 objective of the game is to acquire victory points by defeating as many
 enemies as you can and reach the end of the game by defeating all 
bosses hidden inside the enemies pile. At the end of the game, the 
player or team of players with the most number of victory points wins!</p><p><br/></p><h3>
</h3><h3><strong> <h3>
<strong>~</strong>Features ~</h3></strong></h3><p><strong>Easy to Setup and Track<br/>---------------------------------------</strong><br/>Each type of cards has different art on their backs and the color of their backs and borders is based on their type so that they can easily be formed into a pile! A Player's life points and coins and even the equipped items durability can easily be tracked with the included tokens and markers, and each player uses their own color of dice!</p><p><strong>Customizable Setup<br/>---------------------------------</strong><br/>Having
 a hard time defeating all bosses and enemies? You can choose how many 
of which enemies to include in the enemy pile! Want to reduce the number
 of battle encounters? You can remove some of them from the location 
pile too! Want to have a lot of coins or life points to start the game 
with? As long as the quantity of the tokens is sufficient and equal for 
all players then why not! Customize your Setup to increase or decrease 
the difficulty and speed of your game play!</p><p><strong>Expandable World<br/>-------------------------------</strong><br/>The
 game is designed to be expandable with new locations to stop by, new 
enemies to defeat, new items to use and even new mechanics and rules to 
follow! Each expansion can be added or removed to the core set as 
desired to add more excitement, speed and difficulty to the game!</p><p><b>Supports Single, Multiple Cooperative and Multiple Competitive  and Team-Based Play</b><br/><b>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b><br/>The game is designed to be played like an adventure game where the player goes from one location to location in their quest to defeat all the hidden bosses in their areas. As such, this game can be played by a single player. The game can also be played cooperatively with 2 or more players.</p><p>The game can also become a fun and casual game by playing it competitively with 2 or more players in a free-for-all or team-based play.<br/></p><p><b>Easy to Play but Challenging to Beat</b><br/><b>------------------------------------------------------</b></p><p>The Game Play instructions at its core are very easy to follow, so it is very easy to play. But once you start playing, you'll find that deep inside the game, lays a very long and challenging process of beating it. The game does not simply let you defeat the bosses easily as minion enemies have abilities that will prevent you from getting to them when they are around and even punish you when you lose the battle. Pretty soon you'll be struggling to keep your Life Points intact while managing your resources as you pursue the ultimate goal of defeating them all.</p><p>Can you do it?

<strong>~</strong>About the Campaign~</h3><p>Everyone has a dream of creating something that they want to share to everybody. Some invented machines, for others a new way to do things! For me, I ever since my childhood days, I dreamed of making a game!<br/></p>
I started this project several months ago when I first found the drawings that I have commissioned from an artist a few years ago these drawings were a part of my plan to create a simple card game about Ninjas. From the way I said it, it's like I'm saying that I don't have artistic talents. Well, it's true because the fascination I have with games is not at  their artwork but at their rules and their game play. <br/><br/>Working on a super small budget my old and weak laptop on hand and the inspiration from my loving wife and baby boy, I decided to put my whole body forward to make it happen. I hope your financial support will push me even further to reaching my dream.<br/><br/><br/><h3>
<strong>~</strong>Where the Project is Now~</h3><p>The project is now at a point where the core game set and the first 2  (out of 6) expansions are complete. I am yet to do an introductory and instructional video before I could have the videos posted in the manufacturer's site. <br/></p><p>But at that point I can only show you a playable Print-And-Play prototype in the videos and the action shots as the cost of producing a single final product, much more if it's shipped to my location country would break my budget.<br/></p><br/><h3>

<strong>~</strong>Stretch Goals~</h3><p>My campaign also offers the following rewards upon reaching a certain amount:</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p>              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/789290/files/20140814232035-StretchGoals.png?1408083635"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>Once the first stretch goal is reached, The original game box of size 6.75W x 9L x 1.25H inches and made of 270gsm clay coated card stock will be upgraded to a new game box of 8.5W x 5.25L x 1.5H inches made of chipboard covered with gloss paper. Though it may seem like the original was bigger due to its larger length, The upgraded box is actually larger due to the increase in height.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/807546/files/20140823184216-FT_Cards.png?1408844536"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Once the second stretch goal is reached, the cards for the expansion ""the Fortune Teller"" will be added on top of the game box upgrade. ""<b>The</b> <b>Fortune Teller</b>"" Expansion introduces a new type of cards called Events, that when revealed by the player, could lead them either to a total advantage or disadvantage over the game. These cards are revealed whenever the player reveals a Fortune Teller Location. To remove the randomization of events they will reveal, they must reveal a Shrine Location and buy a Good Fortune Item that they can equip to cancel any Bad Fortune Event they reveal and activate the good ones instead. Feeling naughty? The Shrine can also send a Bad Fortune Item towards other players so that they will activate only Bad Fortune Event instead which can only be removed by revealing a Shrine Location themselves. Also, Beware! In this expansion, a new Boss Enemy has appeared and it has an effect of putting you through a Bad Fortune Event when left undefeated!<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/807661/files/20140823205305-TV_Cards.png?1408852385"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Once the third stretch goal is reached, the cards from the expansion ""The Tavern"" will be added on top of the game box upgrade and the already included ""The Fortune Teller"" Expansion. ""<b>The Tavern</b>"" expansion introduces a new type of cards called Allies! These cards provide a definite advantage in the game provided that you have some coins to spare to activate their effects. You can immediately hire them without paying or doing any action when you reveal a ""<b>The Tavern</b>""<b> </b>Location Card. But choose wisely! They are limited in numbers and you can only have a set of 3 allies at any given time and finally most of them return to their pile immediately once their full effects have been activated.<br/><br/>And finally, once the final stretch goal is reached, that would mean I would have enough funds to commission more artwork especially for the digital game and possibly its other variants that I could develop. Once it is developed I will include every backers name in the games credit roll and I will make the core game freely available to all in all possible platforms.<br/><br/><h3>
<strong>~</strong>Other Things You can Do to Help~</h3>
If you want to do some other things to help with the campaign, then please start by spreading out the word to your family and friend and ask them to spread the word out as well until it reaches out to those who want to support us. As thanks, I will put your name up on our website as one of our Volunteer Campaigners.<br/><br/>Volunteer illustrators are welcome to help us on this campaign as well. As thanks, I will put your name up on our website as one of our Volunteer illustrators and also at the bottom of the card you helped drawn with.<br/><br/>And after getting your copies or playing with our Free Print-And-Play PDF Copies or VASSAL Modules, please do not forgot to give us a good word out so that others may know about it and wish to try the game as well.<br/><br/>And even after the campaign ends, everyone is welcome to become a contributor in our community site, to keep the game growing and more enjoyable. <br/><br/><h3>
<strong>~</strong>Challenges and Risks~</h3>The core game, stretch goal expansions and other digital rewards are basically ready and available for production shipping but it may come to a delay if the manufacturer encounters trouble with component stocks which is highly unlikely!<br/><br/>Also, the supporters who will avail the Contributors tier might experience a short delay of reward delivery due to the custom cards that we will create for them, including the artwork, and coloring per card. But, if they have their line arts ready or even digitally drawn and colored for their custom cards then I believe this challenge can be overcome easily. I and my art illustrator are always standing by to do the job and deliver as fast as we can. <br/><br/><h3>

 Shogun's enemies have escaped! As a Ninja, you are tasked to capture 
them back. But beware! Your rival Ninjas are on the same task!
It's an all-out war to gain the Shogun's favor! Can you capture more enemies than your rivals?
Way
 of the Ninja: Capture the Shoguns Enemies!  is a card and
 dice game designed to be played by 1 up to 4 players of ages 12 years 
and above and can be played for a minimum of 30 minutes and onwards.
The game is designed like a basic Role Playing Game wherein a player 
goes from location to location, attempting to defeat all enemy bosses 
while maintaining a set life points, using coins, items, and captured 
small enemies along the way. The
 objective of the game is to acquire victory points by defeating as many
 enemies as you can and reach the end of the game by defeating all 
bosses hidden inside the enemies pile. At the end of the game, the 
player or team of players with the most number of victory points wins!
 
~Features ~Easy to Setup and Track---------------------------------------Each type of cards has different art on their backs and the color of their backs and borders is based on their type so that they can easily be formed into a pile! A Player's life points and coins and even the equipped items durability can easily be tracked with the included tokens and markers, and each player uses their own color of dice!Customizable Setup---------------------------------Having
 a hard time defeating all bosses and enemies? You can choose how many 
of which enemies to include in the enemy pile! Want to reduce the number
 of battle encounters? You can remove some of them from the location 
pile too! Want to have a lot of coins or life points to start the game 
with? As long as the quantity of the tokens is sufficient and equal for 
all players then why not! Customize your Setup to increase or decrease 
the difficulty and speed of your game play!Expandable World-------------------------------The
 game is designed to be expandable with new locations to stop by, new 
enemies to defeat, new items to use and even new mechanics and rules to 
follow! Each expansion can be added or removed to the core set as 
desired to add more excitement, speed and difficulty to the game!Supports Single, Multiple Cooperative and Multiple Competitive  and Team-Based Play------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The game is designed to be played like an adventure game where the player goes from one location to location in their quest to defeat all the hidden bosses in their areas. As such, this game can be played by a single player. The game can also be played cooperatively with 2 or more players.The game can also become a fun and casual game by playing it competitively with 2 or more players in a free-for-all or team-based play.Easy to Play but Challenging to Beat------------------------------------------------------The Game Play instructions at its core are very easy to follow, so it is very easy to play. But once you start playing, you'll find that deep inside the game, lays a very long and challenging process of beating it. The game does not simply let you defeat the bosses easily as minion enemies have abilities that will prevent you from getting to them when they are around and even punish you when you lose the battle. Pretty soon you'll be struggling to keep your Life Points intact while managing your resources as you pursue the ultimate goal of defeating them all.Can you do it? Good Luck!



~ Basic Game Play Instructions ~Each player starts out with a set of Life points and coins.            And the cards are grouped face down into a pile and placed into the center of table known as the Center Field.For
 each of the player's turns, the player must reveal a Location Card from 
its pile. The revealed location card can either lead the player to a 
safe location where they can heal themselves and restock their weapons, 
or it could lead them to an enemy area where a battle awaits To
 Win a battle, The player must beat the revealed enemy cards by getting 
an attack result equal to or higher than the enemy cards total life 
pointsIf the player wins the battle, then they get to keep (defeat) all the revealed enemy cards as their capture. However, If the player loses the battle then they still get to keep (defeat) certain enemies with total life points lower than their attack result by following the rules and their card abilities. The undefeated enemy cards returns to the bottom of the enemies pile after imposing any penalties they have on the playerBe careful! Losing a battle will reduce the player's Life Points by 1. Other card actions or effects may cause the players Life Points to reduce by 1 too.After revealing a location and doing their required actions, the player will now have the opportunity to return (release) some of their captured Enemy Cards back to the bottom of the Enemies Pile to gain their value in coins or keep them until the end of the game to gain their value in Victory Points.The player turn ends after the player returns the revealed cards in the center field back to the bottom of their respective piles.The game continues until one of the following conditions has been met:The players have managed to reveal and defeat all Boss Enemy Cards in the Enemies Pile                                                                         OROne of the players have their life points reduced to 0                     In a Single Player or  a  2 - 4 player Cooperative Game, defeating all the Boss Enemy Cards will count as an automatic win and losing all Life Points counts as a loss. But, in a 2 - 4 player Competitive Game, the player with the most number of Victory Points wins! To compute for the total number of Victory Points, The player must add the Victory Points from all of their defeated enemy cards then add it to the equivalent Victory Points of their remaining active Life Points at 5 Victory Points each. If a tie has occurred, then the number of coins the players have will determine the winner of the game.

~About the Campaign~Everyone has a dream of creating something that they want to share to everybody. Some invented machines, for others a new way to do things! For me, I ever since my childhood days, I dreamed of making a game!
I started this project several months ago when I first found the drawings that I have commissioned from an artist a few years ago these drawings were a part of my plan to create a simple card game about Ninjas. From the way I said it, it's like I'm saying that I don't have artistic talents. Well, it's true because the fascination I have with games is not at  their artwork but at their rules and their game play. Working on a super small budget my old and weak laptop on hand and the inspiration from my loving wife and baby boy, I decided to put my whole body forward to make it happen. I hope your financial support will push me even further to reaching my dream.
~Where the Project is Now~The project is now at a point where the core game set and the first 2  (out of 6) expansions are complete. I am yet to do an introductory and instructional video before I could have the videos posted in the manufacturer's site. But at that point I can only show you a playable Print-And-Play prototype in the videos and the action shots as the cost of producing a single final product, much more if it's shipped to my location country would break my budget.

""The Fortune Teller"" Expansion introduces a new type of cards called Events, that when revealed by the player, could lead them either to a total advantage or disadvantage over the game. These cards are revealed whenever the player reveals a Fortune Teller Location. To remove the randomization of events they will reveal, they must reveal a Shrine Location and buy a Good Fortune Item that they can equip to cancel any Bad Fortune Event they reveal and activate the good ones instead. Feeling naughty? The Shrine can also send a Bad Fortune Item towards other players so that they will activate only Bad Fortune Event instead which can only be removed by revealing a Shrine Location themselves. Also, Beware! In this expansion, a new Boss Enemy has appeared and it has an effect of putting you through a Bad Fortune Event when left undefeated!Once the third stretch goal is reached, the cards from the expansion ""The Tavern"" will be added on top of the game box upgrade and the already included ""The Fortune Teller"" Expansion. ""The Tavern"" expansion introduces a new type of cards called Allies! These cards provide a definite advantage in the game provided that you have some coins to spare to activate their effects. You can immediately hire them without paying or doing any action when you reveal a ""The Tavern"" Location Card. But choose wisely! They are limited in numbers and you can only have a set of 3 allies at any given time and finally most of them return to their pile immediately once their full effects have been activated.And finally, once the final stretch goal is reached, that would mean I would have enough funds to commission more artwork especially for the digital game and possibly its other variants that I could develop. Once it is developed I will include every backers name in the games credit roll and I will make the core game freely available to all in all possible platforms.
~Other Things You can Do to Help~
If you want to do some other things to help with the campaign, then please start by spreading out the word to your family and friend and ask them to spread the word out as well until it reaches out to those who want to support us. As thanks, I will put your name up on our website as one of our Volunteer Campaigners.Volunteer illustrators are welcome to help us on this campaign as well. As thanks, I will put your name up on our website as one of our Volunteer illustrators and also at the bottom of the card you helped drawn with.And after getting your copies or playing with our Free Print-And-Play PDF Copies or VASSAL Modules, please do not forgot to give us a good word out so that others may know about it and wish to try the game as well.And even after the campaign ends, everyone is welcome to become a contributor in our community site, to keep the game growing and more enjoyable. 
~Challenges and Risks~The core game, stretch goal expansions and other digital rewards are basically ready and available for production shipping but it may come to a delay if the manufacturer encounters trouble with component stocks which is highly unlikely!Also, the supporters who will avail the Contributors tier might experience a short delay of reward delivery due to the custom cards that we will create for them, including the artwork, and coloring per card. But, if they have their line arts ready or even digitally drawn and colored for their custom cards then I believe this challenge can be overcome easily. I and my art illustrator are always standing by to do the job and deliver as fast as we can. 
~Thank You for Browsing~We hope that you like our project and eventually support our campaign by availing one of the tiers above. If you wish to know more about the project, the tiers and the rewards please give us comment and we will do our best to answer your questions.Please spread out this campaign for others to see by sharing this page in your social networks.Happy Supporting!!",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>The ETIKONS</h2>
<p>Desmond ""Etika"" Amofah tragically took his own life on June 19th, 2019. The Etikons are a way to honor his legacy while putting a lasting product into the hands of his fans, and raising a ton of money for mental health and suicide prevention awareness.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Design</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561992828/y03aolo64tbl2rsmtq1z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The design shown is what we expect the joy-con shells to look like when complete. Please keep in mind these designs are not final and subject to change. This is a hand made mock-up, not factory made, and will likely have variations from a factory produced version. We expect that the factory produced version will not have the black and white lines wrap around the sides, and instead only have them on the front, in a similar fashion to the Smash Bros joy-cons. Once we get factory samples, we will include those photos. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>We can all have an impact</h2>
</div><div>
<p>While i've been making custom controllers and joy-cons for many years now, it's simply not feasible for me to take on such a large scale project on my own while donating the proceeds to charity. In order for this project to be a success, it needs to be outsourced to drastically reduce the cost (and my personal workload). </p>
<ul><li>- The joy-con shells will be manufactured in China - <i>unless</i> we can't find a suitable manufacturer. At this time we are still searching for the best manufacturer for the job. In the event that we are unable to find a reliable manufacturer overseas, we can complete the job right here in the USA, but this will incur additional costs and require additional time.  </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>- Options for pre-assembled joy-cons will be offered post campaign. Campaign backers will only receive joy-con shells to install on their own joy-cons with the campaign, unless they upgrade afterwards.</li></ul>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>For Charity</h2>
<p>By reaching our initial goal of $65,000, a <i>MINIMUM </i>of $40,000 will be donated to charity. </p>
</div><div>
<p>We've chosen the JED Foundation as our charity of choice for the following reasons:</p>
<ul><li>-Focus on teens and young adults</li></ul>
<p> </p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Pledge Options</h2>
<h3><i>Joy-Con Shells: </i></h3>
<p>Every pledge in this campaign is for a single set of joy-con shells. These shells must be self installed on a pair of joy-cons that you already own. Want more than one set of shells? No problem! Once you select your pledge, you'll be able to select additional shell sets as an add-on option at checkout! Each shell set comes with a left and right joy-con shell (one black and one white) </p>
<h3><i>Full Joy-cons: </i></h3>
<p>While full joy-cons are not an option during the campaign, you will be able to upgrade your shells in the post campaign to full joy-cons. What does this mean? If you back the campaign you are ""purchasing"" a set of joy-con shells, along with your donation to JED Foundation. If you cannot install the shells your self, or would just like a new set of fully assembled Etika joy-cons, you will be able to UPGRADE your pledge to Full Joy-cons. This can ONLY be done in the post campaign - NOT during the standard campaign. You MUST PLEDGE FOR A SET OF SHELLS TO BE ELIGIBLE. If you do not pledge towards the campaign, you will not be able to upgrade to a full set of joy-cons, and a full set of Etika joy-cons will not be available at any other time, outside of this campaign. The price to upgrade will be $85 - the price of joy-cons plus tax - and none of the upgrade funds will be eligible for donation (it's being spent on the purchase of the joy-cons at retail price). </p>
<p>If you still have questions please contact before backing the campaign. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>The biggest risk involved in this campaign is the manufacturing process. While we are still searching for a manufacturer overseas, we are confident we will be able to find a suitable company. In the event that we are unable to find a suitable representative overseas, we already have motions in place to complete the project right here in the USA. While this would cause a significant increase in the amount of time the project takes to complete, the project WILL be complete.</p>
<p>In the event that for some reason the project cannot be completed, each and every backer will have the option for a full refund or to have their pledge donated to JED Foundation without a reward. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>As Creoqode, we are in the market for more than two years now and gained a valuable experience about manufacturing, packing, customer service and international shipping. We are already in touch with manufacturers for Pyxa and arranged the production. Pyxa can get into production straight after the funds are received. As the founder of Creoqode, I strongly believe that risks involved for on time delivery of Pyxa will be extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>However, it would be fair to note that we will be shipping the product globally, and the taxation, customs duties and other regulations might be different across some countries which might cause some minor delays. However, Creoqode team has extensively researched global delivery of Pyxa and partnered up with DHL in order to preempt any challenges we may face. Additionally, we have set the delivery date as June 2019 leaving us plenty of time to ensure on-time delivery.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will be putting all our effort to prepare detailed and easy to follow tutorials for hardware, assembly and coding. However, after the delivery of Pyxa, some users might still have questions regarding technical aspects of the product or might require assistance, which Creoqode help desk formed of 3 programmers and 2 electrical engineers will be able to answer immediately. We are all prepared for you to have an exciting and smooth experience with Pyxa.</p>

However, it would be fair to note that we will be shipping the product globally, and the taxation, customs duties and other regulations might be different across some countries which might cause some minor delays. However, Creoqode team has extensively researched global delivery of Pyxa and partnered up with DHL in order to preempt any challenges we may face. Additionally, we have set the delivery date as June 2019 leaving us plenty of time to ensure on-time delivery.
Additionally, we will be putting all our effort to prepare detailed and easy to follow tutorials for hardware, assembly and coding. However, after the delivery of Pyxa, some users might still have questions regarding technical aspects of the product or might require assistance, which Creoqode help desk formed of 3 programmers and 2 electrical engineers will be able to answer immediately. We are all prepared for you to have an exciting and smooth experience with Pyxa.

  Here at First Light Studios we strongly believe that this is a genre still worth exploring. Not bound by technological difficulties from the past generations that gave birth to the genre we consider there are a few interesting elements to be revisited while staying true to the classic idea and concept behind Beat em up games;  That said, we also feel confident that we can bring the genre up to the latest generation's graphics, animations, special effects and overall quality that has become paramount to the enhancement of the player's experience. As gamers turned into developers ourselves, nothing is more important to us than to honor the soul of the game in the process.</span></p>
<p>When we set out on our development journey we took inspiration from the classics such as Golden Axe and Streets of Rage, TMNT:Turtles in time to name a few and also from modern ones like Phantom Breaker.  Our main objective is to refresh classic gameplay in an up to date fashion and to deliver experiences you can enjoy with your friends and/or family.</p>

Hi, thanks for your support to our Radiance :: Lux Prima campaign.  Due to an unexpected situation we've been forced to end our crowd-sourcing campaign. 
We've initiated the refund process.  Thank you very much and we hope to count with your support in the future.  
Sincerely, 
- First Light Studios






Thanks a lot for taking your time to check out our project!  We hope that you may find our game offering interesting enough as to grant us your support!  Without further ado, here is our latest venture! 







Radiance :: Lux Prima -   - is our vision of a classic ""Beat em up"" game brought to our newest generation.  
  Here at First Light Studios we strongly believe that this is a genre still worth exploring. Not bound by technological difficulties from the past generations that gave birth to the genre we consider there are a few interesting elements to be revisited while staying true to the classic idea and concept behind Beat em up games;  That said, we also feel confident that we can bring the genre up to the latest generation's graphics, animations, special effects and overall quality that has become paramount to the enhancement of the player's experience. As gamers turned into developers ourselves, nothing is more important to us than to honor the soul of the game in the process.
When we set out on our development journey we took inspiration from the classics such as Golden Axe and Streets of Rage, TMNT:Turtles in time to name a few and also from modern ones like Phantom Breaker.  Our main objective is to refresh classic gameplay in an up to date fashion and to deliver experiences you can enjoy with your friends and/or family.






Its been awhile since we started establishing and blocking out some of the core game elements.  The result so far is a concept prototype we have built for you to download and try.  We opted to give you access to this early content so that you may better understand our vision and also so that you can give us your valuable feedback.  During our campaign the demo will receive regular updates as we further evolve the experience. So please don't hesitate to give us your thoughts and wants for we are certain that together Radiance will become an incredible journey.  You can get our early concept prototype at Game Jolt Now!

First Light Studios is located on the beautiful island of Puerto Rico : Our group is composed of passionate gamers such as yourself that long for a more classic and challenging experience. We have fought hard to achieve our dream of creating a company dedicated to the soul of a game. Unfortunately there's a limit to what we can do without support and so here we are, asking for your help to allow us to make that goal a reality, to help us create games born out of passion. To help share our vision we invite you to try our early concept prototype in hopes that you may want to play Radiance :: Lux Prima as much as we do and in the process share new memories and feelings that will stay with us for years to come.




The reason we opted a Flexible Founding campaign is fairly simple, that's because we are already committed to finish Radiance as one of our Studio's primarily goals. The game will be released as an 'episodic' game saga, thus our main focus is delivering the First Chapter.  With that being said, the better the results of the campaign, the more you'll empower us to make a better game.    
We just want to make it as awesome as we possibly can, but we acknowledge there's only so much we can do without your help!

<p>We present to you... <b>Dragonlord
Supremacy</b>, our humble PC Strategy War Game!</p>
<p>But let’s
turn back the clock and I will tell you the origins of this project.<span>  Some years back, I met Lady Antiva.  I was trying to put together an Arthurian
universe.  We chatted, and continue to chat
some more.  Then the unexpected happened!  She took the plunge and went ahead to create
an entire series built upon the death of King Arthur in chapter 1, and spun off a
whole new world.  </span></p>
<p>Enviously
for me, but happy for her, Lady Antiva's ebooks are now on Amazon.com.  She was kind
enough to help me write the script for ‘Episode 1: Blue Bastion’, and to
release a brand new eNovel in conjunction with my game!<span>  How cool is that?  Long live Lady Antiva!</span></p>
<p>On to the
game design, and where all the hard work began...</p>
<ul>
<li>We had very earlier on
     decided that the story-driven, quest-driven strategy must offer a different experience from all the games out there.<span>  For
     the first 6 months, we scoured the world for folks to help us in art,
     design and consulted widely.  A
     local school NYP pitched in, and their interns helped us with the coding
     using their ‘Supremacy’ game engine</span>
</li>
<li>Over the next 9 months, we clunked
     together a playable demo with the help of the Games Solution Centre and
     Camelot Hobbies, and we have since submitted the game demo to IGF under
     the ‘Indie Category’, and judging is now underway.<span>  Super-cool if we get picked to be a

<li>We have put in place all that is needed to create this game, and we now seek the community to help

<p>
</p><p>Dragonlord
Supremacy is a turn-based strategy game of medieval conquest set in King
Arthur’s era. You are a Dragonlord of Queen Morgana who is tasked to take the
lands using whatever
means necessary. Besides attempting quests to advance the storyline, the gameplay’s unique border
management allows players to strategize campaigns that will ultimately affect
their progress. Game AI will fill the hex map with constant challenges that
make the protection your avatar and units a never-ending dare, as you build,
deploy, attack and bribe your way to victory!</p>
<p>Unlike
many strategy war games that require players to spend an inordinate amount of time on resource gathering, in order
to build and buy - this game allows you to employ strategies around border
enlargement and connection!<span>  Extend your
allied settlements by building bastions to stretch the perimeters of your
territory, and strike fear in your opponents!<br/></span></p>
<p><span>
</span></p><p>The game
is turn-based with 2 phases per turn for the player, namely Orders Phase and
Reinforcement Phase.  In Orders Phase, players can Move Units, Build
Bastion (using Guardians), Pack Settlement (using Cavaliers), Hire a Hero, Attack
enemy/settlement or Seek Diplomacy from Settlement.  In Reinforcement
Phase, players use gold to obtain new combat or diplomatic units.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Move
Units: Players can move both combat and diplomatic/hero units subject to their
movement points.  Up to 3 combat units can be stacked on a single
hex.  </p>
<p>Build
Bastion: Players can use a Guardian unit to build a bastion to expand is
territory on a hex to connect his borders.  Bastions can be upgraded for
units to be deployed there directly during the reinforcement phase.</p>
<p>Pack
Settlement: Players can move an entirely settlement by 1 hex per turn using a
Cavalier unit.</p>
<p>Hire
Heroes: Players may hire heroes to aid combat, but mostly heroes carry special
quests that must be performed in order for the player to advance the storyline
towards completing the game.</p>
<p>Combat:
Different units can be used to attack enemy and NPC units, and also settlements. 
The attack and defence stats are compared after determining if a hit is
successful, and damage is dealt accordingly.  A dice roll aids to add some
randomness to the ‘hit’ ability.  This game has an 'old school'
pen-n-paper, or board game feel to it, something not common these days.</p>
<p>Diplomacy: 
Gold is used in seeking alliance with settlements by a Diplomatic Unit and dice
rolls are used as a chance factor, alongside hostility rating of the
settlement.</p><p><br/></p>

     of the actual gameplay, the Demo is already done! </li>
<li>The next $10,000 will go

<li>At the same time, we know

Supremacy is designed with multi-platform in mind from the onset.  The
current build is for the PC platform.  The user interface has been
optimized for use on Apple iPads and tablets that run on the Android
operating system.  The team estimated that it will cost $6,000 for
Development and QA each per platform.</p>

budgeted $10,000 per episode to be developed.</p>

means necessary. Besides attempting quests to advance the storyline, the gameplay’s unique border
management allows players to strategize campaigns that will ultimately affect
their progress. Game AI will fill the hex map with constant challenges that
make the protection your avatar and units a never-ending dare, as you build,
deploy, attack and bribe your way to victory!
Unlike
many strategy war games that require players to spend an inordinate amount of time on resource gathering, in order
to build and buy - this game allows you to employ strategies around border
enlargement and connection!  Extend your
allied settlements by building bastions to stretch the perimeters of your
territory, and strike fear in your opponents!

The game
is turn-based with 2 phases per turn for the player, namely Orders Phase and
Reinforcement Phase.  In Orders Phase, players can Move Units, Build
Bastion (using Guardians), Pack Settlement (using Cavaliers), Hire a Hero, Attack
enemy/settlement or Seek Diplomacy from Settlement.  In Reinforcement
Phase, players use gold to obtain new combat or diplomatic units.

Move
Units: Players can move both combat and diplomatic/hero units subject to their
movement points.  Up to 3 combat units can be stacked on a single
hex.  
Build
Bastion: Players can use a Guardian unit to build a bastion to expand is
territory on a hex to connect his borders.  Bastions can be upgraded for
units to be deployed there directly during the reinforcement phase.
Pack
Settlement: Players can move an entirely settlement by 1 hex per turn using a
Cavalier unit.
Hire
Heroes: Players may hire heroes to aid combat, but mostly heroes carry special
quests that must be performed in order for the player to advance the storyline
towards completing the game.
Combat:
Different units can be used to attack enemy and NPC units, and also settlements. 
The attack and defence stats are compared after determining if a hit is
successful, and damage is dealt accordingly.  A dice roll aids to add some
randomness to the ‘hit’ ability.  This game has an 'old school'
pen-n-paper, or board game feel to it, something not common these days.
Diplomacy: 
Gold is used in seeking alliance with settlements by a Diplomatic Unit and dice
rolls are used as a chance factor, alongside hostility rating of the
settlement.
What we need & What you get
Here's
how your contribution will be utilized for the Break project in more detail:

The first $5,000 will go
     towards completing Episode 1: Blue Bastion. As you can see from the video
     of the actual gameplay, the Demo is already done! 
The next $10,000 will go
     towards building Episode 2: Green Gridlock.  We have created the
     necessary engine codes, modules, art etc so that the process of developing
     episode 2 will go on without any hiccups!
At the same time, we know
     there are gamers out there who would like to play this game on their iPads
     and Android tablets.  Because we have coded the game in Cocos2D-x, we
     are confident that the port to these platforms will work just fine.  We need an additional $12,000 to achieve this. 

Finally, every $10,000 hereafter
     will go towards the creation of 2 more episodes, in cooperation with backers. The team
     believes in sharing the fruit of our work with you, the superfans!

We have a range of unique
     perks just for you, our ardent supporters!  Please have a look :)Because of our commitment to this life-quest, even
if we do not reach our targets, we will continue to work on this game, though this
means we can only work on it after office-hours and weekends.  But we will
not rest till it is done!  Lady Antiva took a 2 year hiatus from work,
scrimping and saving to release 'The Camelot Prophecies' ebook series, and the founders
must emulate her generosity and determination!

Green Gridlock upon reaching $15,000 mark
Once we
have completed and shipped 'Blue Bastion' to all backers in Nov 2014, the team
will proceed to code Episode 2: Green Gridlock.  We hope to achieve
backing of $15,000 so that the funding received can go towards the realizing of
perks for naming rights and art rights of 'Green Gridlock'.  In case this
target is not met, we will still commit to release a 'special edition' that
will be shipped to backers at Benefactor tier and higher.
Release
Android and iOS version upon reaching the $21,000 (iPad) and $27,000 (Android Tablet) mark respectively
Dragonlord
Supremacy is designed with multi-platform in mind from the onset.  The
current build is for the PC platform.  The user interface has been
optimized for use on Apple iPads and tablets that run on the Android
operating system.  The team estimated that it will cost $6,000 for
Development and QA each per platform.
Release 2
more episodes of Dragonlord Supremacy upon reaching the $37,000 and $47,000
mark respectively
Dragonlord
Supremacy is designed as an episodic game based on the story grid which Lady
Antiva has drafted.  The storyline comprise both linear and concurrent
events, allowing for the narrative to flow smoothly, diverge where necessary
and then merge back for episodic transition. To be prudent, the team has
budgeted $10,000 per episode to be developed.
Risks & Challenges
We are
game developers, script writers, artists but NOT marketers.  We have very
limited networks and can only enlist help through platforms like Indiegogo to
reach out.  But when we start something, we will complete it!  The
Demo proves that we have both the expertise and the will-power to complete this
project.  We believe there is little risk for our supporters as far as Blue
Bastion is concerned.

We have already written the
draft script for 'Green Gridlock' and accumulated a large portion of the
     required artwork.  The funds raised will be used mainly for
     level-design and incorporating the new quests for campaigns in the new
     'Green Gridlock' map 
We have recruited a
     committed pool of freelancers who have helped us put together Blue
     Bastion.  We value their partnership to continue working with us for
     Green Gridlock.  The project will not be at risk due to resignations
     or overheads (rentals, asset purchases etc) as ALL the monies received
     will go directly into the project.",21.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>Ludopolis </strong>is a roguelike dungeon crawler with board games influence, in which you have the ability to control level generation. Ludopolis is a remake of <strong>Undervault</strong>, which features updated graphics, reworked mechanics, and the story.</p>
<p>To celebrate crowdfunding launch we are making <strong>Undervault completely free</strong> on itch.io! Follow the link below to get it on PC / Mac / Linux, or play in your browser.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://angrykid.itch.io/undervault"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560943396/vk0x38cjilrp6hsmqftu.png"" src=""""/></a><br/><a href=""https://angrykid.itch.io/undervault"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(link to the store)</a></p>
<h3>The game</h3>
<p>In Ludopolis, you move through rooms of a <strong>procedurally generated</strong> dungeon. To survive you need to gather various loot and use it wisely. When you encounter a monster, you'll have a choice to fight in <strong>turn-based battles</strong> (with buffs, debuffs, and consumables), or try to avoid them using rogue skills.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/892500/extras/movement.gif?t=1560887125"" src=""""/></p>
<p>What makes Ludopolis unique is the <strong>ability to transform unknown rooms</strong> into your desired room type. For example, you could place a chapel which kills enemies in nearby rooms, or a bedroom to have a place for your character to recover. But in most cases you have to make a hard choice, and just pick the lesser evil. So you would have to choose between a ""treasury with a lot of loot and monsters"", or ""a dull hallway which is safe, but has no loot."" From time to time you may find room cards which transform the room into specified room type. So if you found a Shop card, you could use it on unknown room and reveal a guaranteed room with a merchant.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/892500/extras/reveal_room_2.gif?t=1560887125"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In Ludopolis you will also have to deal with <strong>hunger</strong>, <strong>fatigue</strong>, and <strong>diseases</strong>. To overcome it you can grow plants, use hospital equipment, or trade with a merchant for missing items.  As your character develops, you can unlock new skills from different categories including, combat, stealth, and room transforming. As you go deeper and deeper you will gradually unlock new elements of the story to solve the <strong>mystery of the dungeon</strong>, and find the way home!</p>

<p><strong>Other game features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creating new connections between rooms using a pickaxe or ladders</li>
<li>Owning a pet companion that travels with you through the dungeon.</li>
<li>A daily challenge system that lets you compete with other players for the best score.</li>
<li>Lots of items that would help you on your journey. The map reveals some part of the level, torches that light the room, remove the 'bad vision' debuff, and let you grow plants, and finally booze that will make your character blackout and later wake up in a completely different place!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add to Wishlist on Steam</strong></p>
<p>If it sounds interesting to you - please add Ludopolis to wishlist on Steam. That would help us a lot.</p>

<h3>Team &amp; backstory</h3>
<p>I've made video games since high school. I immediately felt in love with game development after I made my first change to the config file of some Counter-Strike 1.6 mod. Since then, I had experience working on game mods (<a href=""https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=186467"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rubaka Mod</a>), my own indie games (<a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Undervault"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Undervault</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdudHdZYh74"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pixel Express</a>), serious commercial games (<a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/780290/Gloomhaven/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gloomhaven</a>), and also made a bunch of different prototypes (<a href=""https://angrykid.itch.io/the-farlanders"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Farlanders</a>).</p>

<p>Undervault was my debut project that I did completely on my own. Because of that, it has a  simple look, and has few problems in game mechanics. But even despite those flaws it still was <a href=""https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-mobile-games-indie-google-play-store-contest-830643/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">well appreciated</a>, mostly because of the unique mechanics. So now that I feel I have enough skills and experience, I want to rework Undervault with new graphics, story, and mechanics.</p>

<p>I'm collaborating with a very talented pixel artist <a href=""https://twitter.com/contra_bonos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yes I Do</a> to make the game look great. He is also working on a game called <a href=""https://twitter.com/bunker_game"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bunker</a>.</p>

<h3>Platforms &amp; release date</h3>
<p>Estimated release date is May 2020, but we may release the game earlier, or later in 2020. It all depends on the amount of funds raised and the scope of the project. We will start development in September 2019 if the campaign reaches the minimum goal.</p>

</div></div>","Ludopolis is a roguelike dungeon crawler with board games influence, in which you have the ability to control level generation. Ludopolis is a remake of Undervault, which features updated graphics, reworked mechanics, and the story.
To celebrate crowdfunding launch we are making Undervault completely free on itch.io! Follow the link below to get it on PC / Mac / Linux, or play in your browser.
(link to the store)
The game
In Ludopolis, you move through rooms of a procedurally generated dungeon. To survive you need to gather various loot and use it wisely. When you encounter a monster, you'll have a choice to fight in turn-based battles (with buffs, debuffs, and consumables), or try to avoid them using rogue skills.

What makes Ludopolis unique is the ability to transform unknown rooms into your desired room type. For example, you could place a chapel which kills enemies in nearby rooms, or a bedroom to have a place for your character to recover. But in most cases you have to make a hard choice, and just pick the lesser evil. So you would have to choose between a ""treasury with a lot of loot and monsters"", or ""a dull hallway which is safe, but has no loot."" From time to time you may find room cards which transform the room into specified room type. So if you found a Shop card, you could use it on unknown room and reveal a guaranteed room with a merchant.

In Ludopolis you will also have to deal with hunger, fatigue, and diseases. To overcome it you can grow plants, use hospital equipment, or trade with a merchant for missing items.  As your character develops, you can unlock new skills from different categories including, combat, stealth, and room transforming. As you go deeper and deeper you will gradually unlock new elements of the story to solve the mystery of the dungeon, and find the way home!

Other game features:

Creating new connections between rooms using a pickaxe or ladders
Owning a pet companion that travels with you through the dungeon.
A daily challenge system that lets you compete with other players for the best score.
Lots of items that would help you on your journey. The map reveals some part of the level, torches that light the room, remove the 'bad vision' debuff, and let you grow plants, and finally booze that will make your character blackout and later wake up in a completely different place!

Add to Wishlist on Steam
If it sounds interesting to you - please add Ludopolis to wishlist on Steam. That would help us a lot.

New graphics and Story

A new, reworked from scratch, graphics and UI. Above is our comparison from what we had in Undervault, and what we want have now for Ludopolis.
 

A narrative with beautiful illustrations (inspired by Gravity Falls). You will discover how you got into the dungeon, follow character development, and reveal dungeon secrets (after you beat the game!). Also, expect pop culture references.
Game mechanics

We have a lot of changes planned for the game mechanics. I separated them into tiers according to our stretch goals. For a better understanding of the changes I highly suggest to play Undervault (it's free now).


Rework unknown room opening mechanic and UI. I want to give the player more control over it. And make it feel less random.
Remove backpack limitation when moving to the next level (or keep the limit only for room cards).
Add hospital and medicine to heal, which will replace healing in a bedroom by sleeping.
A reworked battle system, which will introduce range weapons and multiple creatures on the same team.
A pet companion!
A complete balance rework.



More graphical variety of rooms. End game levels will have snowy rooms (with freezing effect on your character).
Some rooms will have doors to the 2nd layer. You can use 2nd layer to avoid dangerous passages in the 1st layer (similar to how underground works in Heroes of Might and Magic).
Multiple game difficulties. The harder the difficulty the more options you will have in the game finale.
Full battle rework in order to make it more deep and interesting. Taking inspiration from Slay the Spire and Darkest Dungeon.



Enchantment mechanics for equipment.
More plants to grow and a more advanced growing system.
Cooking and food system. Don't let your food spoil and follow a healthy diet.
Advanced medicine system and diseases/mood system.



Consumable items crafting/alchemy.
Elevator room which will create additional connection between levels and will help you to establish the base on early levels.



Add arcade machine to play your favorite games in Ludopolis!

Action packed tactical spaceship battle. Wage a war by yourself or with your friends against the enemies. Earn resources, upgrade your ship and FIGHT against the other team! Epic pseudo-3d game with max 3 players on each team, both single and multiplayer, for mobile and tablet devices. We love games like Warcraft, Starcraft, Dota and HoN. And we also love space!!! That’s why we have decided to combine all these great things and create an amazing looking game! Firstly, we want it for mobile and tablet devices (iOS, android), as there are not that many games like this for those platforms. Secondly move to PC, MAC, & Linux. If you share our enthusiasm about sci-fi keep reading to find out more about our project! Two teams, 3 players max on each team, will fight for a win. The victory can be achieved by killing the enemy heroes or by destroying their mothership. Players have 2 lives, which means they can re-spawn once after being killed. After that it is a permanent death!Each player picks one ship at the start of a game next to the mothership. The mothership is defended by 3 towers and it automatically provides repairs to nearby ships and sells upgrades for your ship. Upgrades consists of basic upgradable stats like life, shield, armor, speed, short range and long range weapons and then special features. Each hero has his own special set of weapons and shields available for purchase. Upgrades are only applied to their own ship.Players have to earn resources by killing the enemy drones and heroes. Also when one team controls most of the map, that means everyone from that team is behind the middle line at the enemy territory, it gains bonus of 10% to the gained resources. Drones are deployed from mothership in waves.The games should last about 15 minutes.Singleplayer: Game mode for offline play. A player can practice and have fun against bots.Multiplayer: Connect via bluetooth/wifi or internet to play. When connected locally (bluetooth/wifi) players will be able to create or join games with their friends. With internet you can join online games. Win games to earn points and coins! Points will determine your skill and when looking for a game you will fight against more equal enemies. Coins can be spent on different new avatars or brand new heroes. *skin- means the look (graphic presentation) of your ship in game1. Stage - singleplayer for mobile and tablet devices (graphics, sounds, AI-bots coding, testing and bugs fixing) - beta testing for Indiegogo supporters!2. Stage - multiplayer for mobile and tablet devices (wifi or bluetooth connection, internet servers for online-games, some more tests and bugs correction) 3. Stage – lastly we want to develop this game also for PC, MAC, & Linux. - then create more levels for singleplayer, different modes for multiplayer, many more new heroes and bad-ass skins for ships! Well everything in life today is really expensive. It's almost impossible to get funding through traditional methods for a game like this. The best thing about Indiegogo is that we can go directly to the people who love these types of games as much as we do. People who support us know what they will be getting. YOU can even help us create and improve the game! We make the development decisions, we market the game, and we don't have to answer to anyone but you – our fans. We aim to create the best and only the best so we will need help. There comes the outsourcing, creation of AI, cool graphics, connection both wifi/bluetooth and internet, stable game and so much more! Also there are some more fees like company registration, trademarks, licenses for some programs that we will need and a lot more... It is more than we can afford on our own. So if you like the idea of spaceships war game, THIS is the game for you. Help us bring this game to life! Spare few bucks to make this game happen! There are rewards waiting for you of course!We need to raise a minimum of 10 000 € to fund this project. We know we are asking for a lot of money but that's because we are creating something new! Something that has not been done this way for mobile or tablet devices before. That means a new MOBA system that will work smoothly, have beautiful graphics, animation and so much more.We have set this project for fixed budget, so either we make it to the target goal and we create this game or we will die trying :) (sell our kidneys)If we raise more money, we have additional stretch goals we would like to implement to this game.

<i>EPOCH </i>will connect video game     players, and players to their video game, in a way never before accomplished      – imagine interacting with players on PC, Xbox, PlayStation and mobile     devices, no matter which platform you’re playing on. This is a first in     the video game industry and gaming community, and represents a genuine     breakthrough in interconnectivity. You can be part of making that happen,     and the world will never be quite the same again. In fact, it’ll be more     like the world of <i>EPOCH!</i>

Monitor assigned task progress and issue new instructions to your faction members at any time using your mobile device; defend what’s yours, or take what you can from those unable to prevent you.In EPOCH, the stars are the only limit to what you can do.

EPOCH will connect video game     players, and players to their video game, in a way never before accomplished      – imagine interacting with players on PC, Xbox, PlayStation and mobile     devices, no matter which platform you’re playing on. This is a first in     the video game industry and gaming community, and represents a genuine     breakthrough in interconnectivity. You can be part of making that happen,     and the world will never be quite the same again. In fact, it’ll be more     like the world of EPOCH!

Dissident Press has already     brought an e-book and paperback novel to publication, and we’re now poised     to crack the video game industry with an established network of software     programmers, 3D artists and animators along with in-house literary and     graphic design talent to develop and publish a game of outstanding visual     quality and playability.
Make it real – EPOCH is     waiting to happen. Everything is in place, from the technology and     software capability to the completed Game Design Document.
Other Ways You Can HelpSo, you’ve read through the campaign details (thank you), already made a contribution (a BIG thank you!) or perhaps you can’t offer financial support. Hopefully, you're getting as excited as we are about this project, and can't wait to play the game! You can still help us in other ways:
Tell EVERYONE YOU KNOW about      EPOCH and this campaign: get the word out and make some noise!
Don’t forget to use the     Indiegogo share tools. Thanks for all your help.

<p>Wasteland Traders is a traditional property trading board game, based in world laid to waste. Add in a storyline, a few role playing features, game altering survival elements, chances of loot, and a fast action pace of a Post-Apocalyptic world.</p>
<p>+ 8mth and then some of development and play tests...</p>
<p><strong>Wasteland Traders was Born</strong></p>
<p>But wait... If all that wasn't enough, Wasteland Traders will bring an exciting feature with the integration of a Wasteland Traders companion Mobile App on either smart phone or tablet</p>
<p>This is where it gets really good.</p>
<p>The Companion App will add the fast paced time &amp; survival elements of game play, Settings to adjust your experience and a place for fellow wastelander's players around the globe to submit their game stories &amp; scores.</p>
<p><strong>How the Game will Play Out?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Players: </strong>2 - 6 (Recommended age 13+)<br/><br/><strong>Playtime: </strong>120mins (Give or take)</p>
<p><strong>Game play:</strong> If the Player Survive the wasteland (most wont...), the player with the most amount of buildings &amp; Credits wins.</p>
<p><strong>What Sets Wasteland Traders Apart:  </strong>Apart from the obvious. Prior to starting the game the player chooses 1 of 6 wasteland traders as their avatar, each containing a unique perk or trait that can help or sometimes hinder them through the wasteland, forming tactics and strategies for repeat play.</p>
<p>Also the E.D.E.N Device (which is represented on the Mobile App) Plays a big part on how long the game is played out for, no two games will be the same.</p>
<p><strong>What the Game will Consist of</strong></p>
<p>1x 24"" x 24"" game board</p>
<p>6x 28mm Miniatures Player Pieces</p>
<p>6x Player Character Cards</p>
<p>18x Miniatures Buildings</p>
<p>18x Building Cards</p>
<p>16x Survival Cards</p>
<p>16x Loot Cards</p>
<p>36x Health tokens</p>
<p>12x E.D.E.N tokens (Oooh what's that for you say...)</p>
<p>Set of Dice &amp; Play Guide / Rule Book</p>
<p>All this packaged inside a Metal Styled Cardboard Box to show off (when your not playing of course)</p>
<p><strong>What We Need To Make Wasteland Traders Possible</strong></p>
<p>As a Graphic Designer and Sign maker, most of Wasteland Trader will be manufactured in-house and most likely by me the creator and my team, the android app development handle by Mik, and a very creative artist (Harmony) will be providing the Post-Apocalyptic artistic touch to the overall look and feel of the game.</p>
<p>But unfortunately we can only do so much...</p>
<p>That's where you guys come in!</p>
<p>Manufacturing Materials and Production cost are by far where the funding will be needed most. I aim to have Wasteland Traders manufactured entirely in Australia!</p>

<p>To our community,</p>
<p>We regret to inform you that we’ve made the difficult decision to cancel GaymerX East ‘19. Due to complications with our venue, we won't be able to hold the event on the scheduled dates nor will we be able to easily reschedule.</p>
<p>All contributions to our indiegogo will be refunded. If you need further assistance, please feel free to contact us at info@gaymerx.org.</p>
<p>Here’s what happened…</p>
<p>When we confirmed our event with the Microsoft Times Square Conference center, we did so following the same process we had gone through for previous years. We were given the assurance that our agreement remained the same. However, a few days ago we were informed that their procedure had changed and that they would require us to sign a new contract. Partly, it would restrict which companies were allowed to sponsor the event. Additionally, the contract wouldn’t be ready for another month.</p>
<p>Sponsorships pay for a big chunk of our events. Large companies --a number of whom would likely not be allowed under the new contract-- have been some of the biggest sponsors of past GaymerX conventions. We are a small, all-volunteer organization, and not in a position where we can hold a convention without significant financial support. In this case, using the free venue provided to us by Microsoft would be too expensive with the new restrictions being placed on us.</p>
<p>This left us in the difficult position. We either wait for the contract --which if its terms were unfavorable would leave us little to no time to renegotiate before our event-- or we cancel the event before it’s too late to refund our crowdfunding backers. We’re choosing to do what we believe is best for our community because we value your support so much.</p>
<p>While this is an unfortunate outcome, we want to be clear that we harbor no ill will toward the Microsoft Times Square Conference center. Their space is no longer suitable for GaymerX East ‘19 and while we wish we could push forward with the event, we just don’t see a way to do so.</p>
<p>There is no way around it, this sucks. We know how disappointing this must be to our community. We hope you can forgive us. If there’s anything you need from the organization, please feel free to email us: info@gaymerx.org. Our deepest apologies to all of you.</p> <p>Katie Kaitchuck</p>

<h2>Would you love a zombie survival game that makes you feels like an actual survivor? You're in the right place!</h2>
Since playing the first Resident Evil games for the Playstation 1 when I was a kid, I practically fell in love with zombie games and movies. Although there are many games I enjoyed playing I felt like none of them was actually giving me an experience somewhat near the one of a real survivor to a zombie apocalypse. If you share this feeling you're in the right place because that's exactly the kind of experience we want to give you with Pandemia!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our vision is to create an augmented reality massively multiplayer online game that will let you live out a zombie apocalypse in your city (or wherever you are).</div>
<div><img alt=""Screenshot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://pandemia-thegame.com/igg/screen.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Screenshot""/></div>
<h3><img alt=""How The Game Works"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://pandemia-thegame.com/igg/howthegameworks.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""How The Game Works""/></h3>
<div>
<p>You main goal when playing Pandemia will be survival. You will have to do everything a survivor would do to stay alive, for example: look for food, weapons and other items; interact with other survivors; fight with the infected and so on...</p>
<p>As you walk within your city you will find several kinds of <strong>points of interest</strong> scattered on the map, marked by specific symbols. Accessing each one of them will allow you to <strong>collect resources</strong> such as <strong>food</strong>, <strong>weapons</strong>, <strong>medicinals</strong> and other items you can use to survive.</p>
<p>Other than point of interests <strong>nearby players will be also marked on the map</strong>, allowing you to trade items with them or just exchange information.</p>
<p>Besides that, you will be able to <strong>create alliances</strong> that will allow you and the other members to have a series of benefits. As a gang you will be able to <strong>take control of some points of interest</strong>: you will get exclusive access to those resources, until another gang tries to take control of them.</p>
<p>Moreover, actively playing with other members (for example, when they are walking with you on the street) will enhance your character's skills and you will be able to survive more easily.</p>
<p><img alt=""Pandemia"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://pandemia-thegame.com/igg/foto1.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Pandemia""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The world of Pandemia is populated by <strong>two other kinds of entities other than players</strong>: zombies and computer characters. The AI behind them will allow you to enjoy an awesome playing experience even if there aren't a lot of players in your area.</p>
<p>Computer characters will have a <strong>large range of behaviours</strong>: they will sell you items, assign you quests and, sometimes, even help you with your problems!</p>
<p><strong>Game Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>experience points system,</li>
<li>inventory and equippable items,</li>
<li>real time interaction with other players on the map,</li>
<li>real time interaction and combat with infected on the map,</li>
<li>quests and missions,</li>
<li>awesome AI for NPC,</li>
<li>currency system (P$) which you can use to buy exclusive items in the store.</li>

<p><br/>Da quando da bambino ho giocato ai primi Resident Evil per la Playstation 1, mi sono da subito appassionato ai giochi e ai film zombie. Nonostante ci siamo molti giochi di questo tipo che mi sono piaciuti non ce ne è mai stato uno che mi abbia dato un'<strong>esperienza vicina a quella che un sopravvissuto avrebbe</strong><br/><strong>provato in un mondo post-apocalittico</strong>. Se anche tu la pensi così sei nel posto giusto perché è esattamente il tipo di esperienza che vogliamo darti con Pandemia!<br/><br/>La nostra visione è di creare un gioco multiplayer in realtà aumentata che <strong>ti permetterà di vivere un apocalisse zombie nella tua città</strong> (o dovunque tu ti trovi).<img alt=""Screenshot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://pandemia-thegame.com/igg/screen.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Screenshot""/></p>
<h3>IL GIOCO</h3>

In quanto membri di una banda potrete <strong>prendere il controllo di alcuni punti di interesse</strong>: avrete accesso esclusivo a quelle risorse, almeno fino a quando qualche altra banda proverà a sottrarvele!<br/><br/>Infine, giocare attivamente insieme ad altri membri della tua banda (per esempio camminando insieme a loro per strada) migliorerà le skill del tuo personaggio e sarai in grado di sopravvivere più facilmente</p>

GAMEPLAY VIDEO

 


Would you love a zombie survival game that makes you feels like an actual survivor? You're in the right place!
Since playing the first Resident Evil games for the Playstation 1 when I was a kid, I practically fell in love with zombie games and movies. Although there are many games I enjoyed playing I felt like none of them was actually giving me an experience somewhat near the one of a real survivor to a zombie apocalypse. If you share this feeling you're in the right place because that's exactly the kind of experience we want to give you with Pandemia!
 
Our vision is to create an augmented reality massively multiplayer online game that will let you live out a zombie apocalypse in your city (or wherever you are).



You main goal when playing Pandemia will be survival. You will have to do everything a survivor would do to stay alive, for example: look for food, weapons and other items; interact with other survivors; fight with the infected and so on...
As you walk within your city you will find several kinds of points of interest scattered on the map, marked by specific symbols. Accessing each one of them will allow you to collect resources such as food, weapons, medicinals and other items you can use to survive.
Other than point of interests nearby players will be also marked on the map, allowing you to trade items with them or just exchange information.
Besides that, you will be able to create alliances that will allow you and the other members to have a series of benefits. As a gang you will be able to take control of some points of interest: you will get exclusive access to those resources, until another gang tries to take control of them.
Moreover, actively playing with other members (for example, when they are walking with you on the street) will enhance your character's skills and you will be able to survive more easily.

 
The world of Pandemia is populated by two other kinds of entities other than players: zombies and computer characters. The AI behind them will allow you to enjoy an awesome playing experience even if there aren't a lot of players in your area.
Computer characters will have a large range of behaviours: they will sell you items, assign you quests and, sometimes, even help you with your problems!
Game Features

experience points system,
inventory and equippable items,
real time interaction with other players on the map,
real time interaction and combat with infected on the map,
quests and missions,
awesome AI for NPC,
currency system (P$) which you can use to buy exclusive items in the store.

 



Building a game like this requires time, money and many programming and game designing skills. We worked hard until now to build some core gameplay features (that you can see in the video on the top of the page) but we can't build the entire game on our own.
We will use the money to build a fully functional closed beta version of the game in 6 months.
Here's how the money you contribute to this campaign will be distributed:

We at GetTreasureHunting.com
have hidden two treasures for you to find! 
The first treasure is a chest of silver hidden somewhere in America.  Watch the video above to find out where!  We have also created an online treasure hunt
which will
contain 3 weeks of adventures and discovery. 
The hunt may include puzzles, riddles, ciphers, history, cartography,
and much more.  The first one to use
their skills to figure out all the clues will win the prize.  That prize will be determined by the number
of participants. Here is the breakdown of the major milestones: As
we reach each milestone, we will also release an additional clue for the real
life treasure hunt in our video.  So, encourage
your friends to sign up!
Bonus Hunt!
In
addition to the online hunt, we will also be offering a bonus mini online hunt.  The bonus hunt will be just like the online
hunt but with only one clue.  This will
be released separately from our regular online hunt and the first person to
solve the bonus hunt will receive a real piece of treasure.  We are going to keep it a secret what this
treasure will be, but we assure you, you are going to want to win this one!

We just put the project on steam! Visit our steam concept page HEREWHAT IS PHLYNDIR?


Phlyndir is a classic fantasy role-playing game set in the breathtakingly imaginative world of Phlyndir, where players take on the role of a hero who, together with his companions, embark on an epic quest to save the world.The game will be released on PC-windows only for now. Whether we will support other platforms still remains to be seen.FEATURES




Universal Skill Tree. Play the way you want without having to worry about character classes, and skills. Choose the skills you want from a universal skill tree and build a character that is truly ""you"".Runes. There are hundreds of runes in Phlyndir. These runes have qualities which boost your character's stats. Some runes are unique which may also grant your character special skills. Runes can be bought from merchants, found from enemies, obtained as a quest reward, or forged in a rune forge.
Weapons. While your character only uses a single type of weapon, there are different weapons of that same type. These weapons have different abilities which boost your character's power. Some weapons are unique which may also grant your character special skills. Weapons can be bought from merchants, found from enemies, or obtained as a quest reward.
Masters. Find, and Learn hundreds of skills, not in the universal skill tree, from masters scattered throughout the world. Choosing to learn from a master will affect your chances of learning from other masters of opposing schools. Masters may directly teach you skills, or give it as a quest reward.
Self Learning. Your character may learn special skills from repeatedly performing actions. These special skills often help your character become more efficient in performing the actions they stem from. Some self-learned skills are unique which may boost something else besides efficiency.
Titles. The inhabitants of Phlyndir will bestow titles on your character depending on how you have built him. Titles often come with passive bonuses to stats and power, however, titles may also grant your character special skills.
Classes. Your actions and how you fight affect the way the inhabitants of Phlyndir classify(know) your character. Classes often come with passive bonuses to stats and power, however, classes may also grant your character special skills.
Companions. Your character will receive help from different companions during his quest. The choices you make and the way you treat them determine your character's relationship with them. These companions evolve their abilities and personalities in combat based on your character's relationship with them.



STRETCH GOALS

$80,000

Female Love Interests. There will be (3) female NPCs scattered around the world that your character can marry. Courting one NPC will affect your chances of successfully courting the others. Successfully courting and marrying an NPC will give players access to special scenes.
LORE


Phlyndir is a world of floating continents separated by great mist oceans, and connected by massive sky bridges. The world is held together by a glowing blue core of immense power believed to have been created by the gods. A golden-white sun rises everyday to grace the land with light and warmth, and three moons, locked in a stationary triangular orbit with each other, make up the northern sky. Grasslands as far as the eye can see, lush meadows filled with flowers of all colors, thick forests full of vegetation, scorching desserts with endless dunes of sand, and great mountains with frozen snowy white peaks all make up the continents of Phlyndir.
STORY

Scattered across Phlyndir are great temple ruins from when the world was still whole. These ruins hold the knowledge, and secrets of a once great civilization now extinct. Expeditions by the current civilizations to uncover these temples' secrets are not uncommon, however, one fateful day an expeditionary group stumbles upon a dark secret, unleashing a threat that would ravage the land and change the world forever.The player takes on the role of Calheit, one of the chosen few, to embark on an epic quest to stop the horrors that now plague the land, and save the world.
WHY PHLYNDIR?Ever since I was young, I would pretend I had powers, copying the powers of superheroes in comics and on TV. I would imagine the world in hopeless situations from which I would heroically turn the tables around and save it, especially when my crush is in it. When the first role-playing games came out, I was instantly hooked. All of a sudden I was transported to a world where I have powers, and I got to save the world. I would spend days planning out every single aspect of my character to make it as powerful as I can, and months achieving it. Being able to wield powers, saving the world, and the girl always fascinated me.Phlyndir is a world I've created through my habit of imagining these weird situations, and I would like to share this with the world (or people who are like me).WHERE EXACTLY IS PHLYNDIR, AS A GAME, NOW?
For the past 2 years, I've put together a team to help me make Phlyndir a reality, doing odd jobs here and there just to keep both ends together (I'm a programmer). Up until recently, we've been experimenting with techniques and we've come a long way, in terms of quality, from our previous works (100% self-taught, there are no gaming companies/schools/anything where I am).
Now, I believe we are ready to take Phlyndir to the next level. I'm pretty confident in the mechanics engine of the game, and we're at the point where we just need to create assets to put into the game. Right now, almost everything are pretty much placeholder assets, except for our most recent works where we've finally figured out how to make them properly.
The money we will raise here will go to paying for the rent, electricity, water of the office/bunker/house/cave, salaries of the team., and contract works we need for the game. We are a team of 5, 1 Programmer (me), 2 for 3D assets, 2 for 2D assets. We are currently outsourcing sound and music, because we have no idea how to sound and music. Our monthly expenses amount to about $2,000. I've done some pencil pushing and we will need about $46,000 to finish the game. The $4,000 will cover the platform fees of indiegogo and the transfer/conversion fees to our local currency.OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
If you've made a contribution, we are sincerely grateful, however, we ask that you do not stop there. Please help us reach our goal by spreading the word of our campaign.

<p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><b>ABOUT ME</b>
</font></p><p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
Hello, my name is Luis. I've always loved board games, they are an easy way to have fun.
Some friends, a board, some tokens a dice and, let's start playing! but even funiest games can become a little monotonous.

</font></font></p><p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><font color=""black"" size=""3""><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
Asking myself what could be done to give them a new life I thought that fun could start at the time you throw the dice,
so I redesigned dice towers a little.

</font></font></font></p><p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><font color=""black"" size=""3""><font color=""black"" size=""3""> </font></font></font></p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><font color=""black"" size=""3""><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
<p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><b>THE DICE TOWERS</b>
</font></p><p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
For those who don't know them, you should know they are many centuries old, and they were used even by Romans.
Romans where smart, but they trusted no one and with dice towers they tried to make it difficult to players who were cheating with dice.

</font></font></p><p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><font color=""black"" size=""3""><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
Nowadays they have other uses, for example, avoiding dices encounter with game figures and move or even break them.
They can also avoid dices to end up under the couch or become your dog's meal.

</font></font></font></p><p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><font color=""black"" size=""3""><font color=""black"" size=""3""> </font></font></font></p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><font color=""black"" size=""3""><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
<p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><b>MY DICE TOWERS</b>
</font></p><p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
I thought a new utility so they have more influence in the game, giving it a new life and increasing the fun.
To do this I have created towers with multiple exits, so it won't depend only on the dice number, but the exit door through it comes out that can modify the value of it.

</font></font></p><p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><font color=""black"" size=""3""><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
You can use the tower exits to add new rules to the games.
<br/><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
According to the exit door through they come you can add, subtract, divide or multiply another value.
<br/><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
You can assign each door to a player and make that dices that come through his door only count for that player.
<br/><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
Decide the characteristics of a game character or his skills before start to play.
<br/><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
There are many possibilities to give a new life to your games using a tower with many exits.

</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p><p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><font color=""black"" size=""3""><font color=""black"" size=""3""><font color=""black"" size=""3""><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
Practical examples with the 4 exits Olite dice tower and the Parchis game:
<br/><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
-Modifying the result. We give each exit its own modification factor, x0, x1, x2 and x3 (or anything else that comes to mind).
<br/><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
-When the player throws the dice, value applies them to modify the door the dice have left, if the dice goes out the door x0 multiply its value by 0, it becomes 0, bad luck, but if it comes from the x3 door value multiplied by three, now you can run a lot. And if you play with your kids, math practice having fun.
<br/><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
-Chosing who plays. We assign each exit to a player and throw the dice for all players at once, each player moves his pawns using the values of all dice that have come through its door.
<br/><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
As usual, the player who moves first changes each turn, if dices come through your door, of course.

</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p><p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><font color=""black"" size=""3""><font color=""black"" size=""3""><font color=""black"" size=""3""> </font></font></font></font></p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><font color=""black"" size=""3""><font color=""black"" size=""3""><font color=""black"" size=""3"">
<p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><b>WHY INDIEGOGO</b>
</font></p><p><font color=""blue"" size=""5""><font color=""black"" size=""3"">

ABOUT ME

Hello, my name is Luis. I've always loved board games, they are an easy way to have fun.
Some friends, a board, some tokens a dice and, let's start playing! but even funiest games can become a little monotonous.


Asking myself what could be done to give them a new life I thought that fun could start at the time you throw the dice,
so I redesigned dice towers a little.

 
THE DICE TOWERS

For those who don't know them, you should know they are many centuries old, and they were used even by Romans.
Romans where smart, but they trusted no one and with dice towers they tried to make it difficult to players who were cheating with dice.


Nowadays they have other uses, for example, avoiding dices encounter with game figures and move or even break them.
They can also avoid dices to end up under the couch or become your dog's meal.

 
MY DICE TOWERS

I thought a new utility so they have more influence in the game, giving it a new life and increasing the fun.
To do this I have created towers with multiple exits, so it won't depend only on the dice number, but the exit door through it comes out that can modify the value of it.


You can use the tower exits to add new rules to the games.

According to the exit door through they come you can add, subtract, divide or multiply another value.

You can assign each door to a player and make that dices that come through his door only count for that player.

Decide the characteristics of a game character or his skills before start to play.

There are many possibilities to give a new life to your games using a tower with many exits.


Practical examples with the 4 exits Olite dice tower and the Parchis game:

-Modifying the result. We give each exit its own modification factor, x0, x1, x2 and x3 (or anything else that comes to mind).

-When the player throws the dice, value applies them to modify the door the dice have left, if the dice goes out the door x0 multiply its value by 0, it becomes 0, bad luck, but if it comes from the x3 door value multiplied by three, now you can run a lot. And if you play with your kids, math practice having fun.

-Chosing who plays. We assign each exit to a player and throw the dice for all players at once, each player moves his pawns using the values of all dice that have come through its door.

As usual, the player who moves first changes each turn, if dices come through your door, of course.

 
WHY INDIEGOGO

I could put my towers on my website and wait for people slowly knew them, or put them on Indiegogo and people start to have fun with them already. I opted for the second option.

I have more ideas for other dice towers, this campaign will serve me to check if people are interested in using dice towers in their games, and to know if it is worth spending more time designing new models.

ABOUT SHIPPING

The shipping costs depend on the total weight, I think its the fairest way to calculate the cost of each shipment.

Look at every product that interests you its weight, add them together, find your country in the list and see the shipping costs for that weight (up to 9kg).

</ul><p> </p></div>","You can access the PayPal option through our website: www.KharonsCrypt.com Kharon's Crypt is an eerie non-linear dungeon crawler game full of puzzles, riddles and deadly challenges, and graphics designed to follow the aesthetics of the beloved Game Boy Color. In Kharon's Crypt, you'll be playing as Kharon (a being thought to be death itself) in his mission to escape from the crypt where he had been sealed by a deranged king that wanted to elude death.As Kharon, your abilities are flying, going through physical objects, and making your enemies feel dizzy. To defeat your opponents and escape from the crypt, you'll need to steal the bodies of your enemies by possessing them. You'll be able to fly in a bat's body, fight from inside a skeleton, or even use a mime's abilities to help yourself hide.Do you have what it takes to escape from the crypt and compel the Deranged King to meet his fate?We love retro games and want to do justice to the great old classics. All the funds will be fully invested in the development of the game.The more we raise, the more epic the final result will be!Here are our stretch goals to make the game a thousand times better!:[Stretch goal are open until December 31st] PossessionDue to being a spirit, Kharon can't inflict damage on his enemies or interact with physical objects. In order to face the crypt's many threats, you'll need to steal the bodies of Kharon's enemies by possessing them. To possess your enemies, you have to make them feel dizzy first. Once they're knocked down, you can possess their bodies.  Ethereal FormYou can also turn yourself ethereal to pass through objects, which can be useful if you need to run away. Moreover, the ethereal state turns you invulnerable for a few seconds. EnemiesThe crypt is infested with dozens of different kinds of enemies. Each enemy has characteristics and abilities specific and exclusive to their body that you can take advantage of by possessing them. For example:If you steal a winged being's body, like that of a bat, a Shan or a Byakhee, you'll be able to fly over the abyss of the crypt.   
By stealing a fluid body like that of a Slime, you'll be able to slip through surfaces. A Mime's body can help you remain undetected by other fearsome, powerful creatures. But the most important and useful bodies for you will be the bodies that have hands. Since Kharon can't interact with physical objects as a spirit–and therefore can't open doors or chests, activate mechanisms, or use weapons–, stealing a body with hands will allow you to do so very easily.  WeaponsYou will find dozens of different weapons in the crypt that you will be able to use as long as you possess a body with hands. Most of these weapons are too heavy to carry as a spirit, and they will drop to the ground when the possession is over. You can pick them up again by stealing a new body.  Main weapons such as swords, spears and axes have two types of offensive moves: a regular one and a special charge move unique to that weapon. Choosing the right weapon according to the situation will be the key to survive the many threats of the crypt. Aside from the main weapons, you will also find throwing weapons, like Chakrams. Due to their light weight, they're easy to carry with you even when in your spirit form. However, you will still need to steal a body with hands in order to use them. Cursed ObjectsCursed Objects are the rarest and most powerful weapons in Kharon's Crypt. They remain hidden in the depths of the crypt and they will come to great use when solving the puzzles and riddles that you will find in the crypt. These objects can be carried even in spirit form.Haunted Urns Like Kharon, other spirits were imprisoned in urns and sealed in the crypt. These urns hold within them the ire of hundreds of years of imprisonment, which will be unleashed once you break them.You can break the urns either by throwing them or by striking them with a throwing weapon, like a Chakram. Mirror of NitocrisThe Mirror of Nitocris can be used to deflect harmful flashes and lights to protect yourself.The Mirror can also show the deepest fears and nightmares of anyone who looks in it.The Haunted Urns and the Mirror of Nitocris are only two of the ten Cursed Objects that you will find in the crypt. Other Cursed Objects you will find are the Seeds from Lemb, the Járngreipr gauntlets, or the Iron Maiden. Echoes of the CryptAs you already know, the crypt is not only inhabited by terrifying creatures. There are also plenty of imprisoned spirits just like you.The Echoes are the lost, undead souls of guardians that watch over the crypt.They will offer you sound advice and useful clues, as well as sell youmaps of the different levels of the crypt. They will also be more thanwilling to give you some of their prized items... for a reasonable price, of course. Puzzles and RiddlesThe crypt is filled with hundreds of puzzles and riddles designed to prevent Kharon from escaping that will put your quick-wit and reflexes to the test. Bosses and Mini BossesDemons risen from the depths of hell watch over the thresholds of the crypt. If you want to get away from them alive, you will have no choice but to muster your courage and face these powerful beasts.But brute force won't be enough to defeat Bosses in Kharon's Crypt.You will need a combination of brains and brawn, and good strategies.Some of the most fearsome ones will be completely invulnerable and ourmission will be to figure out how to harm them while trying to survive their brutal attacks.Choose your weapons wisely before facing these demons, and remember–there's nothing stronger than the fear of death, and you are Death. There was a King so deranged that he wished to defy his inevitable fate...Death.When Kharon, the one who carries dead souls to their final rest, came to his castle, the Deranged King imprisoned Kharon in a cursed urn using black magic, thus preventing him from claiming the soul he had come to take.However, the King knew that Kharon would not stay contained inside the urn forever, so he ordered to find the best and more experienced sorcerers and architects... To dig under his castle and build the most abyssal crypt ever built.And, with the help of dark pacts and blood magic, he sealed Kharon's urn in it.And the urn was left to rest in the depths of that eerie place.And there it lay, still and intact, waiting in the dark. Until today...Kharon is the main character. He is not Death, but ifsomeone were to describe Death, they'd be describing Kharon. ""That isnot dead which can eternal lie,"" and tonight is the night Kharon finallybreaks free from the urn that had been containing him for hundreds ofyears. Tonight is the night fate will be fulfilled, and none of thehundreds of traps and demons that inhabit the crypt will be enough tostop the wrath of the Lord of the Dead.The Deranged King is the main antagonist. In order to defydeath, the King imprisoned Kharon in a cursed urn, and ordered to buildthe most abyssal crypt that had ever been built to seal Kharon's urn in the depths of the cryptusing dark pacts and blood magic. The Echoes of the Crypt tell storiesabout the King, and in all of them he's portrayed as a wise and kindmonarch. But derangement can cloud the vision of even the purest of menwhen the shadow of death draws near.They're the souls of people who died long ago and are now stuck in the crypt, unable to go to heaven or hell.They want to help Kharon as they know it's the only way they can breakout of the crypt. Some of them will offer you their whisperings(advice), others will give you clues and others will sell you items inexchange for coins to pay for their passage to the afterlife. However,years of ethereal existence have made them very forgetful, and some ofthem can't remember their names, or if they were even human in the firstplace. But one thing they know for sure is that they are one withmusic, as music comes from the soul. And since for them pronouncinglines that don't combine is nothing short of a crime, they speak inrhymes at all times.The Horrors are Kharon's enemies, but they can also become his weapons. Most of them wander the crypt aimlessly, but the worst Horrors are the ones that seal the thresholds to prevent Kharon from reaching the surface. But those are not the only Horrors you will see in this crypt. The closer you get to the exit, the more terrifying the Horrors you will encounter–Leng Spiders, Ghouls, Ghasts, Yigs, Shans, Byakhees, Wendigos or even Hounds of Tindalos.There are also Demons that come to the crypt from the depths of hell just to have some fun getting their revenge on Kharon, since he was the one who sent them there and they still hold their grudges against him. They enjoy torturing Kharon and love how dull and eerie the world has become since he was imprisoned. Gameplay-wise, Kharon’s Crypt is inspired by all the game influences that we had during our childhood. It’s mainly inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages & Oracle of Seasons, Hebi's favorite childhood games. They mean a lot to him as they were his first Zelda games, and some of the first games to make him spend months trying to solve many of their puzzles and challenges.However, gameplay and playability are not everything.

<h3>How is the Sidepad different from other mobile game pads?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, the best Bluetooth controllers are bigger than the phones! Bulky game pads aren't great for carrying around and Bluetooth connectivity isn't responsive enough for games that require high accuracy. Like when you miss a shot in a first-person shooter because the game pad isn't fast enough to register the button click! We truly hate that! So in an effort to make something that we wanted, we built a game pad that connects directly to the phone. The Sidepad game pad is both responsive and easy to hide away. The Sidepad Moto Mod is a game pad for true mobile gamers!</p>
<h3>Our Background</h3>
<p>We remember how exciting the prospect of mobile gaming was. We also remember how disappointed we were when the games we played on our nice smart phones couldn't compare to our console experience. So, we hacked our phones and connected our XBox controllers. Mobile gaming got a  little better, and yet, it was still disappointing. Buttons not registering, directional controls being delayed, and controllers disconnecting during game play.... all side effects of an immature gaming experience. This is why we are so passionate about bringing a game pad to market. We can finally start to have console experiences on our phones instead of buying separate mobile gaming devices!</p>

<h3><strong>About campaign</strong></h3>
<p>Greetings, would like to tell a few words about myself. My name is Andrii, I am a professional programmer, who wants to become a professional game developer and dedicate myself to this path. I like to make and play games. Sometimes I write fantasy stories.</p>
<p>Now I want to introduce to you my action RPG game <strong>""Stories of Noorides""</strong>. Noorides is the name of the world in this story. This game is an epic voxel story where you have to get used to the role of a magician who learns how to control his strength and emotions. The main challenge for him is to meet his fears and win over them.</p>
<p>For more immersion in the game you have to not just press the buttons to use magic, you must draw the runes that cast spells. You can improve spells and learn new ones.</p>
<p>On your road to the goal you will face a lot of enemies. In order to win, you must cleverly use your magic power to kill these enemies. Another challenge that can occur on your path is solving ancient puzzles. Puzzles will require careful study of the environment and logical thinking.</p>
<p>Also, you will face unique bosses who require special tactical solutions. Facing a boss helps you to understand who your mage really is.</p>
<h3><strong>Financial goal</strong></h3>
<p>The main purpose of fundraising is to get the opportunity to dedicate myself completely to the development of the game. Also, to buy music for the game. If I can get more money, additional things will be done.</p>
<ul>
<li>$7000 - main goal;</li>
<li>$13 000 - added more additional content;</li>
<li>$15 000 - more sound effects;</li>
<li>$20 000 - port to Android and iOS;</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation will help to dedicate myself to the game. That will make the game very exciting for you. The donation allows me to not waste time on a job and spend all time for the game.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main problem I may face is the long process of creating a game if the required amount is not collected.</p>
<p>I don't have to deal with technical issues because I'm a programmer and have 2 years of experience with Unity3D. All the basic mechanics already made for the game</p>

<h3>Campaign Goals</h3>
<p>Hello, Supporters! My name is Michael and I'm raising money to launch a website that will host free video game assets for indie developers. The assets will be royalty-free and can be used in commercial games without the need for attribution.</p>
<p>If you've ever tried to make a game from scratch, you know how demotivating it can be when you realize how much time will be spent simply making assets. I've been in that very situation myself. This is exactly why I'm passionate about creating a solution to these roadblocks. With your help, we can help brilliant stories come to life when developers get the resources they need.</p>
<p>What are my qualifications? I'm an experienced independent web developer with several websites under my belt, as well as, numerous other programming projects. I also have two years worth of experience with creating low poly models and game development.

We enjoy all types and styles of gaming. We play miniature games, board games, card games, role-playing and anything else we can get our hands on.  Since we were so involved in gaming we always dreamed about having a place to share our ideas and knowledge with other people. We have always wanted to create a site where we could post battle reports, reviews, tutorials, tips and tricks, among other content about the games that we have grown to love. The problem is, we are students and simply don’t have the disposable income to keep up with all the games we enjoy. Additionally, we didn’t have the funding necessary to ensure that the website we created could grow and develop at the quality level we would demand.</p>
<p>This is where you come in! With the help from contributions made from other people who love gaming our goal is to create a community site where people can come together and share their passion for the games they enjoy. We plan on funding the site long term by creating a web-store that will support the site and supply people with the games they know and love at a reasonable price. Because we are students, and know how expensive gaming can be, we will do our very best to provide products at fair prices. We hate being gouged by big box stores because of their high overhead. We hope that with our minimal running expenses it will allow us to pass on the saving to our customers and dedicated community members. We believe that everyone should be able to afford the games they love.</p>
<p>Aside from the store, we plan to do great things with the site. We would like to create reviews for the latest and greatest games as well as the classics that everyone knows and loves. We also plan on posting tutorials on how to play the games we offer so that people who are new and are interested can come and learn how to play. Dave is a future educator and has taken on creating these tutorials to help relieve some of the challenges that new players can face when learning a new game. In addition we will definitely be providing battle reports and tutorials on a variety of wargames, as this is one of our favorite styles of gaming.  James is our resident artist, and he would like the opportunity to share some of his painting skills and talents with everyone through a series of instructional videos. To ensure that everyone is included in our site, we also have the Ladies of Die Atomic who plan on offering a variety of content on gaming from the female perspective. We will strive to ensure that there will be content for everyone at Die Atomic Games.</p>
<p>Not only do we want to create our own content, we also want the community to have a part in the content that is posted on the site.  If there is anything that you would like to see, we are open to suggestions. Also if you are someone who is interested in creating your own content, we would like to be able to allow users to submit content to us, that will be reviewed and posted to the site. We want you to be involved in our site, we want you to be a part of this larger gaming network.</p>
<p>Die Atomic Games is a project that has come from the passion and the drive of people who love gaming in all its forms. We want to bring the feel of a friendly neighbourhood game store directly to you. We want to create a place where anyone can gather, learn and share their experiences and ideas. This isn’t the end of our ideas…this is just the beginning. We have plans for the future and if you’re lucky we might just let you in on some of them. We thank you for your support. Die Atomic Games…more than your friendly neighbourhood gaming store.</p>
<p>Cost Breakdown ($11625 budget after IndieGoGo and Third Party Fees):</p>
<p>$6780 Qoute for website/store construction and design.</p>
<p>$240 For 1 year of web hosting.</p>
<p>$360 to Secure payment through paypal.</p>
<p>$525 For business licensing.</p>
<p>$1000 Working office budget (Office supplies, shipping materials, etc).</p>
<p>$1000 Perk budget. </p>
<p>$1720 To cover initial orders, shipping and unforseen costs. </p>
<p>We think it is important to have a site that is held to a higher standard and is easy to use, which is why we asked for multiple qoutes from professional website developers and took the best one. </p>
<p>Here are some examples of the painting quality you can expect with some of our perks:</p>

We believe that everyone should be able to afford the games they love.
Aside from the store, we plan to do great things with the site. We would like to create reviews for the latest and greatest games as well as the classics that everyone knows and loves. We also plan on posting tutorials on how to play the games we offer so that people who are new and are interested can come and learn how to play. Dave is a future educator and has taken on creating these tutorials to help relieve some of the challenges that new players can face when learning a new game. In addition we will definitely be providing battle reports and tutorials on a variety of wargames, as this is one of our favorite styles of gaming.  James is our resident artist, and he would like the opportunity to share some of his painting skills and talents with everyone through a series of instructional videos. To ensure that everyone is included in our site, we also have the Ladies of Die Atomic who plan on offering a variety of content on gaming from the female perspective. We will strive to ensure that there will be content for everyone at Die Atomic Games.
Not only do we want to create our own content, we also want the community to have a part in the content that is posted on the site.  If there is anything that you would like to see, we are open to suggestions. Also if you are someone who is interested in creating your own content, we would like to be able to allow users to submit content to us, that will be reviewed and posted to the site. We want you to be involved in our site, we want you to be a part of this larger gaming network.
Die Atomic Games is a project that has come from the passion and the drive of people who love gaming in all its forms. We want to bring the feel of a friendly neighbourhood game store directly to you. We want to create a place where anyone can gather, learn and share their experiences and ideas. This isn’t the end of our ideas…this is just the beginning. We have plans for the future and if you’re lucky we might just let you in on some of them. We thank you for your support. Die Atomic Games…more than your friendly neighbourhood gaming store.

The current version of Car Tune came to be after many years of experimental tempering with various game mechanics and coding vehicle physics.<br/><br/>Currently I'm the sole developer of Car Tune and working on it is exciting and very rewarding. However I came to a point where I can't do any substantial progress on my own. If I want to realize this project so the game is in a stable state, I'll need to recruit and hire people.<br/>That is why I need your support!<br/><br/><strong>The money I receive will go towards:</strong></p><ul>

I'd be playing only racing games since a young age and now I only wish to make my own. Before I began pursuing my dream of developing my own racing game, I've been heavy into modding. I modded various titles during my time and I co-developed a patch that allows the addition of new maps in the video game <strong>Street Legal Racing Redline</strong>. I worked as a free lancer at <strong>Red Dot Games </strong>and many others. Currently I work at <strong>Boombit games</strong> as a programmer and other works of the trade. </p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Links:</strong></h3><ul>

The current version of Car Tune came to be after many years of experimental tempering with various game mechanics and coding vehicle physics.Currently I'm the sole developer of Car Tune and working on it is exciting and very rewarding. However I came to a point where I can't do any substantial progress on my own. If I want to realize this project so the game is in a stable state, I'll need to recruit and hire people.That is why I need your support!The money I receive will go towards:

 ABOUT ME Hello, I'm Bartosz aka Wichur. Since forever I loved racing and the automotive tuning scene. I'd be playing only racing games since a young age and now I only wish to make my own. Before I began pursuing my dream of developing my own racing game, I've been heavy into modding. I modded various titles during my time and I co-developed a patch that allows the addition of new maps in the video game Street Legal Racing Redline. I worked as a free lancer at Red Dot Games and many others. Currently I work at Boombit games as a programmer and other works of the trade.  Links:

<h2><span style=""font-size: large;"">COMMODITY isn't just a good game..., it's a Great Game! </span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: large;"">What it does:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: large;"">1. It helps kids with their math.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: large;"">and it does it all in a <em><strong>fun</strong></em> way!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><em>Back Then</em></strong></h3>
<p>Originally, when I first invented and got<strong> COMMODITY</strong> developed I was able to get 960 games produced but the manufacturer required a 10,000 game minimum order for the 2<sup>nd</sup> order and no matter how I did the math I couldn’t come up with enough funds to place that second order and back then, there was no Indiegogo.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: large;""><img alt=""Original Production Game"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.markallangames.com/Images/Original.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Original Production Game""/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: large;""><img alt=""The Campaign Goal"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.markallangames.com/Images/The_Campaign_Goal.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Campaign Goal""/></span></p>
<h3><strong>My Campaign Goal is to raise enough money to:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Get a<strong> minimum order of 10,000 games </strong>produced of my boardgame<strong> COMMODITY™ </strong>as well as all the Perks required.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Deliver those games and the Perks to all the supporters.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>and to START an evolution to people playing my boardgame, as much as or more than Monopoly. This will not happen overnight so the goal for this campaign is to just get it started with the minimum order of games produced and delivered and be able to say we did!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: large;""><img alt=""The Evolution"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.markallangames.com/Images/The_Evolution_1.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Evolution""/></span></p>
<h3><em><strong>Help it Evolve.</strong></em></h3>
<p>Have you ever been annihilated out of the game of Monopoly?</p>
<p>What did you do? Did you stay around and watch for a little while or did you just go home?</p>
<p>Did you ever complete a game of Monopoly where a player actually won everything or did the players just decide to quit after about 3 or 4 hours of play?</p>
<p>In my game COMMODITY that won't ever happen! It is designed so all players stay in the game to the end even though they do have to keep themselves out of Receivership. It is a challenge but Commodity is no harder to play than Monopoly.</p>
<p>It is also designed so that players can play it to any length they so choose. Long or short, it's up to them.</p>
<p>And there's big money in it and it is a totally different than Monopoly. The only similarities are that it is played on a board, it has money and it has dice and that is where the similarities end.</p>
<p>It's time for something new.  It's time to make way for a new kid on the block with no disrespect to Monopoly.</p>
<p>I want people to<strong> EVOLVE </strong>from playing Monopoly, to playing my boardgame, <strong>COMMODITY</strong>, which I designed to be better than Monopoly, but you have to make your own judgement on that.</p>
<p><strong>Now if you don't believe it, then there is only one thing to do, find out for yourself. </strong></p>
<p>I just gaurantee that <strong>COMMODITY</strong> is a great game that<strong> EVERYONE </strong>can play, no one is left out, and for the people that want more of a challenge, well, I have advanced rules, called the High Risk Game Rules and for a real challenge,<strong> COMMODITY Gauntlet.</strong></p>
<p>The truth of the matter is, there is room for both Monopoly and<strong> COMMODITY</strong>. I just want<strong> COMMODITY</strong> to have the chance for people to get to know it and know what a great game it is.</p>
<h3><em><strong>Videos of COMMODITY</strong></em></h3>
<p>I was going to hire some people to do a video evaluation of my game for all of you to see but I think as soon as I mentioned the name Monopoly, in conjunction with<strong> COMMODITY</strong>, they didn't want to do it and so they refused to do it. Why is that? I'll let you decide on that one yourselves. I just wanted to explain why you aren't seeing any videos on my game out there other than the one I did myself, which does show the excitment that<strong> COMMODITY </strong>generates.</p>
<p>We have a review (<a href=""http://www.roachware.org/2013/05/lehrstunde-in-bwl/#more-1990"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.roachware.org/2013/05/lehrstunde-in-bwl/#more-1990</a>) but it is in German. You can use Google Translate (<a href=""http://translate.google.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://translate.google.com/</a>) to translate it.</p>
<p><img alt=""What You Can Claim"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.markallangames.com/Images/What_You_Can_Claim.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><em><strong>Imagine This</strong></em></h3>
<p>Imagine being back there when Monopoly first came about and imagine being a person who was credited with helping get it on it's way. Today your ancestors would be able to say, ""guess what my great granddaddy/mother did?"" And they would tell everyone and be proud but would they be able to prove it.</p>
<p>So now imagine helping out this campaign and gettings Perks with the slogan <strong>""I Helped Start the COMMODITY Boardgame Evolution."" </strong>and having your ancestors say ,  ""guess what my great granddaddy/mother did?"" and then be able to pull out one of these Perks to prove it. Yep, they'd be mighty proud.</p>
<h3><em><strong>Be Able to Say...</strong></em></h3>
<p>Be able to say that you were there at the begining, and helped out, when<strong> COMMODITY </strong>got it's start, against all odds. That you were instrumental in making it a success. We can't survive in this world without help from other people.</p>
<p>And we have great<strong> Perks </strong>and you can<strong> Earn Extra Perks </strong>just for telling your friends. <strong>So let everybody know.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><img alt=""My Mission"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.markallangames.com/Images/My_Mission.PNG"" src="""" style="""" title=""My Mission""/></strong></h2>
<p>To get people gathered around to play with their friends and family and to inspire their lives with action and enhance their futures with purpose.</p>
<p>I hope my game will inspire all who play it or even those who just watch it being played.</p>
<p>One of the biggest comments I get from people about my game is ""Wow, this is just like real life.""</p>
<p>Playing games with friends can inspire people.</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Good Game"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.markallangames.com/Images/Good_Game.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><img alt=""What is Needed"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.markallangames.com/Images/What_is_Needed.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""What is Needed""/></p>
<p>The cost of Manufacturing the minimum order and the Perks $170,000 and the other costs such as  mailout and shipping costs $115,000 , duties and taxes $15,000, brokerage fees where applicable, administration fees, legal fees, insurance and temporary warehousing in Canada and the USA and the Indiegogo and Credit Card fees $20,000 all adds up to $320,000.</p>
<p>We need this money to get that first 10,000 games produced and delivered along with all the Perks.</p>
<p><em><strong>The High Goal</strong></em></p>
<p>Some people might think this is a pretty high goal. The reason is quality, the minimum order the manufacturer requires and mailout costs. I don't want to sacrifice quality. When I say quality I mean quality of play and quality of product. I could cut down on the plastic pieces, but I remember playing games that would run out of plastic pieces and it was annoying and that is the last thing I would want you to be is annoyed with me.</p>
<p>So that is why the higher goal than other boardgames and yes I had to go and invent a game with a lot of pieces in it but that is what brings quality of play into it. It's <strong>NOT</strong> a game where you just roll the dice, move, land on a square and do what it says and then your turn is over.  Thos type of games get boring pretty dang quick.</p>
<p>It's a game where you get to manage your own company, <strong>be the boss</strong> you know. It is no harder than Monopoly to learn but it is designed with more action in mind and there is also the High Risk Game Res for the more challenging oriented people.</p>
<p>As I originally manufactured 960 games in 1989, all my relatives and friends, already have their copies and already showed me support back then. I can't ask them again so I am counting on all of you to contribute and make this a success and did I mention, there are some great Perks and not only that but you can <strong>Earn Extra Perks</strong> for telling your friends.</p>
<p>I saved a lot of money by being able to redo all the graphic artwork myself, especially on the Game Board. As my original artwork cost me $12,000 back in 1989 I didn't even want to ask how much it would cost me now. That would have just upped the campaign goal.</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""New Game board"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.markallangames.com/Images/New_2013_Game_Board_Redcd.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""New Game Board""/></strong></p>

<p>Many Good Perks as well as the right to say you helped start an Evolution. On the Majority of the Perks offered there will be a slogan such as<strong> ""I Helped Start the COMMODITY  Boardgame Evolution"".</strong></p>
<p>The Bankers Visor won't have it on due to space on the Visor and the Certificate of Merit will be a little different as well.</p>
<h3><strong><strong><em>Earn Extra Perks: </em></strong></strong></h3>
<p>You can also earn extra perks by telling your friends about our campaign. See below.</p>
<p>All Contributors above a certain level will get their name on the Tower. Space is limited as the Tower can only be so big. The Highest Contributor gets his/her name at the top and Gets to Say that they are the<strong> ""King of the Tower"".</strong> See King of the Tower below.</p>

<p>The tower is a game in itself. Remember the old game we used to play as kids<strong> ""King of the Hill"" or ""King of the Castle"". </strong>This is a different version of that game. In the Perks, $120 or more will get you on the Tower. The Largest Contributor to the Campaign will get their name at the top of the Tower and be able to say that they are the ""King of the Tower"". See the Tower on our website at<strong> <a href=""http://www.markallangames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.markallangames.com</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tower </strong>will be updated as the Campaign progresses with the<strong> Top Contributor </strong>shown so that all will have a chance to supersede the person at the top. Let's not get too serious about it though, let's just make it fun!</p>

<h2><em><strong><img alt=""The Challenges"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.markallangames.com/Images/The_Challenges.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Challenges""/></strong></em></h2>
<p>Ever since I was a kid and played Monopoly I had wanted to invent a boardgame as good as or better than Monopoly, and finally I did, as that is what many people, who have played my game, have told me and I challenge anyone to play my game and tell me different.</p>
<p>I want to make it clear that<strong> COMMODITY </strong>is a totally different game than Monopoly. It is based on building a company not investing in Real Estate. See the Gist of the Game below.</p>
<p>My Challenge was to invent and produce the game, your challenges are below!</p>
<p><strong>The Challenges are:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>If you don't think that COMMODITY could be as good as or better than Monopoly then I challenge you to play it and tell me different.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>To get your name on the Top of the Tower and if you so desire, to be the<strong> ""King of the Tower"".</strong> See The Tower.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Tell all your friends and get an extra Perk. See The Perks below.</p>

<h3><em>Go Home or Not?</em></h3>
<p>In Monopoly players get annihilated, then what do they do, go home?</p>
<p>Players don't get annihilated in<strong> COMMODITY™</strong>.They stay in to the end of the game even though they can go into receivership. You can still go on to win the game after going into receivership. Many have. There is a Bankruptcy clause but no one to date has ever gone into Bankruptcy.</p>
<h3><em>Length of Play</em></h3>
<p>Monopoly takes a long time to play and many games have not been finished because of this.</p>
<p><strong>COMMODITY™</strong> can be played to many different lengths. Short or long.</p>
<h3><em>Equality</em></h3>
<p>In Monopoly if you don't get one of the elite property sets you're pretty much hooped and you know it.</p>
<p>In<strong> COMMODITY™ </strong>players all start on an even playing field. The same amount of money and their companies are all the same size.</p>
<h3>
<em>Advanced Play</em> (For the boardgamegeek.com Guys)</h3>
<p>There are many different versions of Monopoly but they are still the basic Monopoly game in a different guise.</p>
<p>In<strong> COMMODITY™ </strong>there are rules for Advanced Players who want more of a challenge in the form of the High Risk Game Rules, available when the High Risk Game Kit is produced (Exception: See the Perks below), next campaign, and there is also<strong> COMMODITY Gauntlet™ </strong>a real advanced play where you can link boards together and play with a team.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img alt=""The Gist of the Game"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.markallangames.com/Images/The_Gist_of_the_Game.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Gist of the Game""/></p>
<p><strong>COMMODITY™ </strong>is based on the building of a company by buying and selling Raw Materials, Products and Commodities. Players start with a $200,000 loan which they have to pay off or pay interest on every time they round the board.</p>
<p>There are six companies on the board; Carat Diamond Company, Pick Mining Company, Eagle Aircraft Company, Gusher Oil Company, Classic Car company, Golden Grain Company. Players choose a company to be theirs during the play of the game and sit near their main office as that is where they manage their company from.</p>
<p>They intially purchase Raw Materials, then they place these on their outlets around the board where they become Products. Other players landing on the outlets must purchase all products on the outlets, whereby they place these products in their commodities side of the warehouse where they now become Commodities.</p>
<p>The game can be played to any length, which player set at the beginning of the game or during play. and players don't get annihilated out of the game even though there is a Bankruptcy Clause it has never happened in the countless games that have been played.</p>
<p>A Player must Declare a Win in order to try and win<strong> COMMODITY. </strong>To Declare a Win a player must be debt free and have the agreed upon amount of money decided by the players then each player has one more turn to try and defeat the declaring player and it has happened many times.</p>
<h3><em>Length of Play</em></h3>
<p>The Length of Play in<strong> COMMODITY™ </strong>is determined by the players who set a monetary limit to play to.  A longer game would be played to $2,000,000 a Shorter game to $500,000 and an average game to $1,000,000. A real long game could be played to $5,000,000.</p>
<h3><em>Who Can Play</em></h3>
<p>Anyone can play, ages 10 to adult, no one is left out. Younger children can play with supervision. They might even win.</p>
<p>For more information on the game go to <a href=""http://www.markallangames.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>www.markallangames.com</strong></a></p>
<h3><em>On the Shelf or...</em></h3>
<p>Now inventing it is one thing, but it doesn’t do any good just sitting on a shelf, it needs to be played, it needs to get out into the world so that it can bring joy, excitement and challenge into peoples lives. I need you to help me do that and in exchange I give you my perks and you will be able to say you helped start an Evolution!</p>

4. It keeps all the players in the game from start to finish.

and it does it all in a fun way!
 
Back Then
Originally, when I first invented and got COMMODITY developed I was able to get 960 games produced but the manufacturer required a 10,000 game minimum order for the 2nd order and no matter how I did the math I couldn’t come up with enough funds to place that second order and back then, there was no Indiegogo.

 

My Campaign Goal is to raise enough money to:
1. Get a minimum order of 10,000 games produced of my boardgame COMMODITY™ as well as all the Perks required.
2. Deliver those games and the Perks to all the supporters.
3. and to START an evolution to people playing my boardgame, as much as or more than Monopoly. This will not happen overnight so the goal for this campaign is to just get it started with the minimum order of games produced and delivered and be able to say we did!
 

Help it Evolve.
Have you ever been annihilated out of the game of Monopoly?
What did you do? Did you stay around and watch for a little while or did you just go home?
Did you ever complete a game of Monopoly where a player actually won everything or did the players just decide to quit after about 3 or 4 hours of play?
In my game COMMODITY that won't ever happen! It is designed so all players stay in the game to the end even though they do have to keep themselves out of Receivership. It is a challenge but Commodity is no harder to play than Monopoly.
It is also designed so that players can play it to any length they so choose. Long or short, it's up to them.
And there's big money in it and it is a totally different than Monopoly. The only similarities are that it is played on a board, it has money and it has dice and that is where the similarities end.
It's time for something new.  It's time to make way for a new kid on the block with no disrespect to Monopoly.
I want people to EVOLVE from playing Monopoly, to playing my boardgame, COMMODITY, which I designed to be better than Monopoly, but you have to make your own judgement on that.
Now if you don't believe it, then there is only one thing to do, find out for yourself. 
I just gaurantee that COMMODITY is a great game that EVERYONE can play, no one is left out, and for the people that want more of a challenge, well, I have advanced rules, called the High Risk Game Rules and for a real challenge, COMMODITY Gauntlet.
The truth of the matter is, there is room for both Monopoly and COMMODITY. I just want COMMODITY to have the chance for people to get to know it and know what a great game it is.
Videos of COMMODITY
I was going to hire some people to do a video evaluation of my game for all of you to see but I think as soon as I mentioned the name Monopoly, in conjunction with COMMODITY, they didn't want to do it and so they refused to do it. Why is that? I'll let you decide on that one yourselves. I just wanted to explain why you aren't seeing any videos on my game out there other than the one I did myself, which does show the excitment that COMMODITY generates.
We have a review (http://www.roachware.org/2013/05/lehrstunde-in-bwl/#more-1990) but it is in German. You can use Google Translate (http://translate.google.com/) to translate it.

Imagine This
Imagine being back there when Monopoly first came about and imagine being a person who was credited with helping get it on it's way. Today your ancestors would be able to say, ""guess what my great granddaddy/mother did?"" And they would tell everyone and be proud but would they be able to prove it.
So now imagine helping out this campaign and gettings Perks with the slogan ""I Helped Start the COMMODITY Boardgame Evolution."" and having your ancestors say ,  ""guess what my great granddaddy/mother did?"" and then be able to pull out one of these Perks to prove it. Yep, they'd be mighty proud.
Be Able to Say...
Be able to say that you were there at the begining, and helped out, when COMMODITY got it's start, against all odds. That you were instrumental in making it a success. We can't survive in this world without help from other people.
And we have great Perks and you can Earn Extra Perks just for telling your friends. So let everybody know.
 

To get people gathered around to play with their friends and family and to inspire their lives with action and enhance their futures with purpose.
I hope my game will inspire all who play it or even those who just watch it being played.
One of the biggest comments I get from people about my game is ""Wow, this is just like real life.""
Playing games with friends can inspire people.

  

The cost of Manufacturing the minimum order and the Perks $170,000 and the other costs such as  mailout and shipping costs $115,000 , duties and taxes $15,000, brokerage fees where applicable, administration fees, legal fees, insurance and temporary warehousing in Canada and the USA and the Indiegogo and Credit Card fees $20,000 all adds up to $320,000.
We need this money to get that first 10,000 games produced and delivered along with all the Perks.
The High Goal
Some people might think this is a pretty high goal. The reason is quality, the minimum order the manufacturer requires and mailout costs. I don't want to sacrifice quality. When I say quality I mean quality of play and quality of product. I could cut down on the plastic pieces, but I remember playing games that would run out of plastic pieces and it was annoying and that is the last thing I would want you to be is annoyed with me.
So that is why the higher goal than other boardgames and yes I had to go and invent a game with a lot of pieces in it but that is what brings quality of play into it. It's NOT a game where you just roll the dice, move, land on a square and do what it says and then your turn is over.  Thos type of games get boring pretty dang quick.
It's a game where you get to manage your own company, be the boss you know. It is no harder than Monopoly to learn but it is designed with more action in mind and there is also the High Risk Game Res for the more challenging oriented people.
As I originally manufactured 960 games in 1989, all my relatives and friends, already have their copies and already showed me support back then. I can't ask them again so I am counting on all of you to contribute and make this a success and did I mention, there are some great Perks and not only that but you can Earn Extra Perks for telling your friends.
I saved a lot of money by being able to redo all the graphic artwork myself, especially on the Game Board. As my original artwork cost me $12,000 back in 1989 I didn't even want to ask how much it would cost me now. That would have just upped the campaign goal.

 

Many Good Perks as well as the right to say you helped start an Evolution. On the Majority of the Perks offered there will be a slogan such as ""I Helped Start the COMMODITY  Boardgame Evolution"".
The Bankers Visor won't have it on due to space on the Visor and the Certificate of Merit will be a little different as well.
Earn Extra Perks: 
You can also earn extra perks by telling your friends about our campaign. See below.
All Contributors above a certain level will get their name on the Tower. Space is limited as the Tower can only be so big. The Highest Contributor gets his/her name at the top and Gets to Say that they are the ""King of the Tower"". See King of the Tower below.
Don't forget to click on your favorite perk on the right.
 
 
The tower is a game in itself. Remember the old game we used to play as kids ""King of the Hill"" or ""King of the Castle"". This is a different version of that game. In the Perks, $120 or more will get you on the Tower. The Largest Contributor to the Campaign will get their name at the top of the Tower and be able to say that they are the ""King of the Tower"". See the Tower on our website at www.markallangames.com. 
The Tower will be updated as the Campaign progresses with the Top Contributor shown so that all will have a chance to supersede the person at the top. Let's not get too serious about it though, let's just make it fun!

Ever since I was a kid and played Monopoly I had wanted to invent a boardgame as good as or better than Monopoly, and finally I did, as that is what many people, who have played my game, have told me and I challenge anyone to play my game and tell me different.
I want to make it clear that COMMODITY is a totally different game than Monopoly. It is based on building a company not investing in Real Estate. See the Gist of the Game below.
My Challenge was to invent and produce the game, your challenges are below!
The Challenges are:
1. If you don't think that COMMODITY could be as good as or better than Monopoly then I challenge you to play it and tell me different.
2. To get your name on the Top of the Tower and if you so desire, to be the ""King of the Tower"". See The Tower.
3. Tell all your friends and get an extra Perk. See The Perks below.

Go Home or Not?
In Monopoly players get annihilated, then what do they do, go home?
Players don't get annihilated in COMMODITY™.They stay in to the end of the game even though they can go into receivership. You can still go on to win the game after going into receivership. Many have. There is a Bankruptcy clause but no one to date has ever gone into Bankruptcy.
Length of Play
Monopoly takes a long time to play and many games have not been finished because of this.
COMMODITY™ can be played to many different lengths. Short or long.
Equality
In Monopoly if you don't get one of the elite property sets you're pretty much hooped and you know it.
In COMMODITY™ players all start on an even playing field. The same amount of money and their companies are all the same size.

Advanced Play (For the boardgamegeek.com Guys)
There are many different versions of Monopoly but they are still the basic Monopoly game in a different guise.
In COMMODITY™ there are rules for Advanced Players who want more of a challenge in the form of the High Risk Game Rules, available when the High Risk Game Kit is produced (Exception: See the Perks below), next campaign, and there is also COMMODITY Gauntlet™ a real advanced play where you can link boards together and play with a team.
 
 
COMMODITY™ is based on the building of a company by buying and selling Raw Materials, Products and Commodities. Players start with a $200,000 loan which they have to pay off or pay interest on every time they round the board.
There are six companies on the board; Carat Diamond Company, Pick Mining Company, Eagle Aircraft Company, Gusher Oil Company, Classic Car company, Golden Grain Company. Players choose a company to be theirs during the play of the game and sit near their main office as that is where they manage their company from.
They intially purchase Raw Materials, then they place these on their outlets around the board where they become Products. Other players landing on the outlets must purchase all products on the outlets, whereby they place these products in their commodities side of the warehouse where they now become Commodities.
The game can be played to any length, which player set at the beginning of the game or during play. and players don't get annihilated out of the game even though there is a Bankruptcy Clause it has never happened in the countless games that have been played.
A Player must Declare a Win in order to try and win COMMODITY. To Declare a Win a player must be debt free and have the agreed upon amount of money decided by the players then each player has one more turn to try and defeat the declaring player and it has happened many times.
Length of Play
The Length of Play in COMMODITY™ is determined by the players who set a monetary limit to play to.  A longer game would be played to $2,000,000 a Shorter game to $500,000 and an average game to $1,000,000. A real long game could be played to $5,000,000.
Who Can Play
Anyone can play, ages 10 to adult, no one is left out. Younger children can play with supervision. They might even win.
For more information on the game go to www.markallangames.com
On the Shelf or...
Now inventing it is one thing, but it doesn’t do any good just sitting on a shelf, it needs to be played, it needs to get out into the world so that it can bring joy, excitement and challenge into peoples lives. I need you to help me do that and in exchange I give you my perks and you will be able to say you helped start an Evolution!

An unusual adventure in a jungle full of dangers!The game combines elements of a classic hunting simulator and survival. You traverse a vast, open world full of life and realistic fauna. Apart from many dinosaur species, different dangers await you, such as huge mosquitoes and poisonous plants. You will meet a lot of prehistoric reptiles. From small, agile specimen to powerful giants weighing tonnes. You will have a huge world (10km/2) from the Cretaceous Period at your disposal. Each traveled meter will be a test of survival! You will find a piece of a basic, random equipment. To survive, you have to conquer the world in search of a better weapon, technology, ammo or clothes.The island, where you are located, is inhabited by 15 different dinosaur species. From blood-thirsty Tyrannosaurus to small and agile velociraptors. Choose your target carefully, find enough ammo, and stuff as much food as you can find into your backpack. Don’t forget water! In the meantime, keep building your base so that you have somewhere to hide! Ultimately, the game will offer a single-player mode. But if you like group hunting, a cooperative mode for 4 players will make you happy. Main functions:-      a huge exploration area (10 km/2),-      15 dinosaur species of various marking, sex, and weight,-      hunt by day, night, at dawn and during the rain,-      hunger and thirst bars,-      a limited amount of food and ammo!, Explore and hunt in order to survive!,-      a huge arsenal to use — from an arch to a rocket launcher!,-      an island full of life — poisonous plants and insects! PHOTOS AND MOVIES FROM A GAME

 

 

A CAPSULE AND THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME
You begin with what you find in an escape pod. Here is what you can find:


 


-      matches — to make a fire, dry yourself, warm-up or scare off smaller reptiles,
-      walkie-talkie — to communicate with other players,
-      water — you will not survive without it, remember to refill it,
-      first aid kit — you will need it for sure,
-      torch —- makes it easier to track animals at night,
-      canned food — not very tasty but will suffice for starters.
 
Apart from that, you will also find one of 10 available guns in your capsule. You can refine the guns and add some changes, such as a better crosshair or an additional clip.
 
WEAPONS
There will be over 15 types of weapons available in the game. You can modify and refine each of them. Add a better crosshair, riflescope, and even an additional clip.

 
ISLAND

The hunting area you get is a whole 10 km/2! Each part of the island hides different dinosaur species, plants or annoying insects.


 

Exploring and survival
There are over 20 abandoned buildings on the map, i.e. observation points, abandoned labs, abandoned buildings where you can find weapons, precious ammo, tools, food, and water. All objects appear randomly so each game is a new adventure! Additionally, from time to time supplies are dropped. You can find there new clothes and ammo, as well as a few other useful objects.

 

 
WHAT HAPPENS IF A PREDATOR MEETS A PREDATOR?
You can see a fight between a Carnotaur and a huge Spinosaurus attached below. In Hunt: Primal Reptiles it is possible. If dinosaurs cross paths, a fight might ensue!

 
DINOSAURS
We currently own 15 dinosaur species. Each dinosaur has different markings. There are both male and female dinosaurs. Each specimen also differs in weight, so that every player can compare their trophies with others!

 
The cycle of night and day and the weather
We introduced a simulated daily cycle in Hunt: Primal Reptiles. It means that you can hunt at sunrise, by the starlight or at sundown. The weather also changes.

Play the Demo now! Try out this PC and Mac build with 2 levels set in ""Stranger Things"" & ""Game of Thrones"" spoof-worlds. Made to let you on board, they will still challenge your skills. Are you up to it? ;)  We'd love to hear your thoughts about it! Please share them with us :)  Please note that this is only an early stage in the development! Many other features have to come and it may undergo more changes as we progress through development!  As you binge watch your favorite TV shows as usual, like ""Breaking Bad"" & ""Stranger Things"", you unexpectedly discover the existence of a parallel fictional dimension called Landflix through the use of nuclear batteries and a normal remote controller. Landflix is a clear reference to video-on-demand platforms like Netflix and TV shows universe.Now you are Larry, stuck in this fictional world. As he sets foot in Landflix’s home he meets Uncle Doc, a scientific genius who had recently disappeared. Before you can understand what’s going on, a small robot appears. It has a small screen on its body that displays an old man’s face. It’s Landflix’s evil CEO, who sent its minion after you to steal the nuclear batteries in an attempt to escape Landflix and conquer the world with its army of fictional characters. As Larry fights over possession of the remote, 5 of the 6 batteries fly out of the remote and end up in different TV shows, and the robot retreats. Finally you understands what’s happening. Apparently the CEO and his uncle were coworkers once, but Uncle Doc had imprisoned him in this parallel dimension, when he realized he was scheming to conquer the world. After getting stuck here, the CEO used this dimension to create Landflix, a system designed to decrease the cerebral capacity of the masses through its TV shows, and easily conquer the world. Now that Larry is stuck inside Landflix too, their only option (and the only way out) is to stop the evil CEO and get back all 6 batteries!  In Landflix’s Home menu you can scroll between TV shows and select which one you’d like to watch... ehm, play. The first show you have to travel through is called Peculiar Stuff and has a horror-themed feel, as you travel through forests, schools and labs. In this stealth based world, you’ll have to use your skill to travel between parallel worlds to find your way against trained soldiers and dimensional monsters. The second show is set in an icy world dominated by an evil queen and the army of the undead. The perfect fantasy setting! In this metroid-vania like world you’ll have to fight your way through an undead horde, explore castles and ride a dragon to reach and defeat the evil queen. We couldn’t avoid putting a superhero based world in our line-up!

<h3>In Short</h3>
<p>Hi there.  I've been making scenery for several years, first producing card stock scenery as Arid Hills Productions (still available through RPGNow.com) and then over the last three or four years I've been making resin scenery as Arid Hills Gaming.</p>
<p>As a long time wargamer, one thing has become more and more obvious as time goes on - although there are some really wonderful wargaming models out there, they're often obscenely over priced.  I've decided to do something about that and intend to bring out a collection of high quality miniatures, vehicles and scenery which DOESN'T cost the earth. </p>
<p>What I need to achieve this goal is your help to assist me in initially tooling up to produce these miniatures.  After much research, I have decided to go the way of three dimensional printing as this will enable me to quickly prototype and produce quality miniatures without huge start up costs.  Having said this, obtaining a high end commercial quality three dimensional printer doesn't come cheap, and that's where you can help.</p>
<p>With your help, I can start producing the type of miniatures we all love, without the ridiculous cost.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Putting it bluntly I need a printer which can produce the type of fine detail which is required for quality miniatures.  Your kind contributions will go towards the purchasing of the printer and printing materials need to start production and of course to provide you with some brand new, spectacular miniatures (all of the contributions include postage costs, so there are no hidden costs).  Below is a summary of the perks offered for supporting me (more detailed descriptions are in the perks themselves):</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Below is the first designed squad, complete with four riflemen, four sub-machingunners, a trooper carrying a grenade launcher and a commander with pistol.</em> </p>
<a href=""http://s609.photobucket.com/user/aridhillsgaming/media/FirstSquad.jpg.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""First Squad of 28mm Troops photo FirstSquad.jpg"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i609.photobucket.com/albums/tt176/aridhillsgaming/FirstSquad.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a>
<p>$35: 10 x 28mm miniatures.  Includes one squad leader and one special weapon trooper.</p>
<p>$65:  20 x 28mm miniatures.  Includes two squad leaders and two special weapons troopers.</p>
<p>$100: 40 x 28mm miniatures.  Includes four squad leaders and four special weapons troopers.</p>
<p>$135: 50 x 28mm miniatures.  Includes four squad leaders, four special weapons troopers and two five man command squads.</p>
<p>$155:  56 x 28mm miniatures.  Includes four squad leaders, four special weapons troopers, two five man command squads and one six man heavy weapons squad.</p>
<p>$170:  62 x 28mm miniatures.  Includes four squad leaders, four special weapons troopers, two five man command squads and two six man heavy weapons squads.</p>
<p><strong>And if you don't really need 28mm troopers, why not try something completely different:</strong></p>
<p><em>Some concept art of the Machai Scout Walker to get you salivating!</em><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p>All of the perks below are scaled for use with 28mm figures.</p>
<p>$300:  A Machai Class walker.  Approximately 300mm tall armoured walker with two weapons systems.</p>
<p>$350:  A Machai Class walker.  Approximately 300mm tall armoured walker with four interchangeable weapons systems.</p>
<p>$450:  A Machai Class walker.  Approximately 300mm tall armoured walker with six interchangeable weapons systems and a alternate head variant.</p>
<p>$650:  A Machai Class walker.  Approximately 300mm tall armoured walker with six interchangeable weapons systems, an alternate head variant and a custom coat of arms/sygil worked onto the armour.</p>
<p>$900:  A Machai Class walker.  Approximately 300mm tall armoured walker with six interchangeable weapons systems, an alternate head variant, a custom coat of arms/sygil worked onto the armour and your likeness modelled onto a 28mm pilot model.  This is a one off opportunity to have yourself imortalised as a gaming piece - don't waste it!  You get a free standing 28mm model and one plugged into the command deck.</p>
<p>I've decided to to use Indiegogo's fixed funding method so that if I'm not successful in making my goal, no-one who has contributed loses out - everyone gets their money back.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If I'm successful in raising the money I need, I will be able to to create high qualitiy miniatures for a reasonable cost.  I will be able to provide the wargaming and RPG community with a range of figures to cover their needs and interests.  I'll even be able to to create vehicles, again for a modest amount. </p>
<p>Some of the projects already on the drawing board include mutants and cultists with a 'junker' feel to them. I'm also hoping to be able to provide a number of WWII tanks in 28mm size for a more 'historic' feel to armies - Imagine fielding a platoon of Tiger P tanks and looking at the expression of wonder (or possibly horror) on your opponents face.</p>
<p>I'll even be able to provide short custom production runs allowing people to request truly unique forces.</p>

<p>Obviously the simplest way to help is to contribute money in return for your favourite perk, but I understand that sometimes money is tight (or maybe these miniatures don't fit your current theme).  That's okay.  Really, it is.  What you can do instead is share this campaign with as many people as possible.  Share it with all your friends.  Share it with people even if you don't think they'd be interested (I recently found out a work colleague wargamed and I'd would never have picked him in a million years), share it in groups, emails, tweets and anything you can think of.  That way, even if you can't support this financially, you can still help make this a successful project.</p>

</div></div>","In Short
Hi there.  I've been making scenery for several years, first producing card stock scenery as Arid Hills Productions (still available through RPGNow.com) and then over the last three or four years I've been making resin scenery as Arid Hills Gaming.
As a long time wargamer, one thing has become more and more obvious as time goes on - although there are some really wonderful wargaming models out there, they're often obscenely over priced.  I've decided to do something about that and intend to bring out a collection of high quality miniatures, vehicles and scenery which DOESN'T cost the earth. 
What I need to achieve this goal is your help to assist me in initially tooling up to produce these miniatures.  After much research, I have decided to go the way of three dimensional printing as this will enable me to quickly prototype and produce quality miniatures without huge start up costs.  Having said this, obtaining a high end commercial quality three dimensional printer doesn't come cheap, and that's where you can help.
With your help, I can start producing the type of miniatures we all love, without the ridiculous cost.


What We Need & What You Get
Putting it bluntly I need a printer which can produce the type of fine detail which is required for quality miniatures.  Your kind contributions will go towards the purchasing of the printer and printing materials need to start production and of course to provide you with some brand new, spectacular miniatures (all of the contributions include postage costs, so there are no hidden costs).  Below is a summary of the perks offered for supporting me (more detailed descriptions are in the perks themselves):
 
Below is the first designed squad, complete with four riflemen, four sub-machingunners, a trooper carrying a grenade launcher and a commander with pistol. 

$35: 10 x 28mm miniatures.  Includes one squad leader and one special weapon trooper.
$65:  20 x 28mm miniatures.  Includes two squad leaders and two special weapons troopers.
$100: 40 x 28mm miniatures.  Includes four squad leaders and four special weapons troopers.
$135: 50 x 28mm miniatures.  Includes four squad leaders, four special weapons troopers and two five man command squads.
$155:  56 x 28mm miniatures.  Includes four squad leaders, four special weapons troopers, two five man command squads and one six man heavy weapons squad.
$170:  62 x 28mm miniatures.  Includes four squad leaders, four special weapons troopers, two five man command squads and two six man heavy weapons squads.
And if you don't really need 28mm troopers, why not try something completely different:
Some concept art of the Machai Scout Walker to get you salivating!
 
 
All of the perks below are scaled for use with 28mm figures.
$300:  A Machai Class walker.  Approximately 300mm tall armoured walker with two weapons systems.
$350:  A Machai Class walker.  Approximately 300mm tall armoured walker with four interchangeable weapons systems.
$450:  A Machai Class walker.  Approximately 300mm tall armoured walker with six interchangeable weapons systems and a alternate head variant.
$650:  A Machai Class walker.  Approximately 300mm tall armoured walker with six interchangeable weapons systems, an alternate head variant and a custom coat of arms/sygil worked onto the armour.
$900:  A Machai Class walker.  Approximately 300mm tall armoured walker with six interchangeable weapons systems, an alternate head variant, a custom coat of arms/sygil worked onto the armour and your likeness modelled onto a 28mm pilot model.  This is a one off opportunity to have yourself imortalised as a gaming piece - don't waste it!  You get a free standing 28mm model and one plugged into the command deck.
I've decided to to use Indiegogo's fixed funding method so that if I'm not successful in making my goal, no-one who has contributed loses out - everyone gets their money back.


The Impact
If I'm successful in raising the money I need, I will be able to to create high qualitiy miniatures for a reasonable cost.  I will be able to provide the wargaming and RPG community with a range of figures to cover their needs and interests.  I'll even be able to to create vehicles, again for a modest amount. 
Some of the projects already on the drawing board include mutants and cultists with a 'junker' feel to them. I'm also hoping to be able to provide a number of WWII tanks in 28mm size for a more 'historic' feel to armies - Imagine fielding a platoon of Tiger P tanks and looking at the expression of wonder (or possibly horror) on your opponents face.
I'll even be able to provide short custom production runs allowing people to request truly unique forces.

Add more items/buffs/ranks of spells/buffs(currently it used only max ranks and fully talented(eg. 5/5 imp. Blessing of might on BoM(rank 7))4. Add sources of items/buffs with a mark ""how hard to get this item"".5. Add ""recommended"" items - the option that will show you item that will buff your performance as much as possible (you'll get an item list, in ""how hard to get this item"" order)6. Add talents/rotations menu, to allow users to test unusual builds (spell power rogues, etc)7. Rework UI, regroup it to taps(eg. talents tab, rotations tab, etc)8. Add Character import9. Add Debuffs(currently, you can select ""target armor"" option).10. Add RaidSetupCalculator - identical tool, but where you can test up to 40ppl raid group performance. 11. Ingame AddOn with similar options12. Android/iOS version of that tool. 1. 500$ Web portal launch and maintain.2. 1000$ More DPS classes.3. 1500$ Huge update with additional items/buffs/talents/fight duration/rotation.4. 2000$ All classes/roles, more detailed statistics.5. 3000$ Item/buffs sources and ""how hard to get"" index.6. 4000$ RaidSetupCalculator and Character/Raid import.7. 5000$ Ingame AddOn.7. 10000$ Android/iOS app.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>It's time to play Creights!</strong></h2>
<p>Thank you for taking this moment to discover the next household family game named - Creights!</p>
<p>We are the Gagne family - David, Isabelle, Raven, Perry and Roman - and our dog Jake. Over the Christmas holidays with our two older children home visiting we found ourselves playing some card games. It wasn't long before they were bored and wanted to do something different. That's when Isabelle found some directions for a new game and we started playing. Not understanding all the rules clearly we began to invent our own rules and soon we had invented something that the kids wanted to keep playing as it was a lot of fun and never the same - and that is how Creights started. The kids were texting their friends as we were playing “I’ve got a new game to play at our next party” Part of the fun that first night was changing the rules as we played, and so we incorporated that into the rules of our own version. Bright colored cards and variable rules make it a perfect game for the young kids through to the grandparents.</p>
<p>David has been a Graphic Designer for 25 years and seeing how much fun the game was decided to put his talents to good use and developed the playing cards into what they are now. With David's years of experience in the printing industry the quality of the cards you can expect are that of the same high quality cards of companies like Bicycle cards and Hasbro.</p>
<h3>Playing the Game</h3>
<p>Creights can be played by 2-8 players. It is suggested that you have 2 decks for 5 or more players.</p>
<p>Game play involves being able to change the colour (suit) to any colour to only certain colours; reversing play direction; making other players pick up cards to having players pick up multiple cards; forcing players to switch seats; and of course creating your own rules for the game such as getting to pick which player has to pick up a card, having the next player pick up 5 cards, or even making players all loose a card or having to make strange animal noises - it's endless as making up the rule of choice is up to you.</p>
<h3><strong>We are excited to invite you to help us print our first run!</strong></h3>
<p>We need funding to produce the first run of Creights and you are the first to get the opportunity to join in the fun. We are simply offering what we know to be a great entertaining game as our perks depending on how many decks you desire (and might we suggest two decks if you plan on playing with 5 or more people).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>A Sampling of the Cards</strong></h3>
<p>Each deck comes with 52 game cards and game directions as well as a game scoring card.</p>

<p>Tripods! is a <strong>narrative strategy game</strong>, with the overriding story pre-determined but the timing of events so flexible that no two games are ever identical. </p>
<p>During the game 2-4 players compete to have the most Survival points by the time the Martians are overcome. Points are gained for escaping, surviving and killing Tripods with the help of Her Majesty's Army, but as the game goes on and alien foliage spreads throughout the city external help begins to fade away, leaving players fighting each other for the last remaining spaces of refuge. Watch your friends betray and backstab each other as the Tripods gaze on! </p>
<p>
To see how the game works, have a look at the <a href=""http://images.indiegogo.com/medias/1041099/files/20130921090812-Tripods_Rules_US.pdf?1379779696"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>game rules</strong></a> or this <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=rXd_4iPreeE"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>unboxing and play-through video</strong></a>.

<p> </p>
<p>In each game box you will receive:</p>
<p>London Game board</p>
<p>Rulebook</p>
<p>8 Headline Event cards</p>
<p>66 Tidings cards</p>
<p>20 Character cards</p>
<p>5 Tripod cards and card stands</p>
<p>5 Military Unit cards and card stands</p>
<p>40 Populace Counters</p>
<p>6 Chance Counters (4 Cylinders and 2 Carriages)</p>

<p>1 10-Sided Die</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>""Tripods!"" began as an idea over breakfast one morning at the Asylum Steampunk Festival in Lincoln. Over a year's development and playtesting by a group of committed  Bristol board game lovers the concept has been honed into a gripping and always-different experience with stunning paintings from local artist Solly Solomon. Rather than tender the idea to a big games chain we want to keep this an independent project by games fans for games fans, with prices as low as we can make them whilst ensuring the same quality we would insist on ourselves. 
</p>
<p>Prototypes of the game have been created and sent to various groups and magazines for playing- reviews, videos and releases will be posted here as they become available. All design work has been completed and the print run is ready to start, this campaign is hoping to take enough pre-orders to fund it. Germany company Ludo Fact who printed such well-known games as Carcassonne, Settlers of Catan and Dixxit are lined up to produce the games so you can be sure the quality will be top-notch. 
</p>
<p>Sadly the manufacturers cannot guarantee delivery by Christmas, but we know many people will want to order this game as presents so we will send a special Tripods! Christmas card for every game purchased if it looks like the games themselves aren't going to be done it time. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>If the target is met there will be some exciting new perks added, such as strictly-limited-edition metal Tripod figures and Military Unit Badges which will ONLY be available to Indiegogo campagn backers. So get spreading the word! THE INVASION HAS BEGUN!

<br/><br/></div>","Papetura is an
adventure, point&click puzzle game in the fantasy world made entirely of paper.
Once in a while, the light reaches the paper and awakens the world. Guiding Pape & Tura you will discover the paper world, with all its hidden mysteries waiting to reveal themselves, covered with paper-darkness.  During that journey, many obstacles and creatures will arise, accompanied by a considerable amount of riddles and puzzles to solve!FOLLOW ON :    TWITTER   FACEBOOK   YOUTUBE
There’s
an opportunity to encounter a tapeworm in the demo! It contains the intro and the first chamber that
you can explore. This is only a small part of the game, the size of which will suffice for more than 2 - 3 hours of gameplay.HD versions download:   [Win]   [Mac]   [Linux]

""Papetura examines the delicate, natural state of paper"" ~ Luke Siuty, IndieGameMag .com""(..) Player sees straddling the line between reality and fiction in a way that makes the world pop out at you."" ~ Andrew Moore, PixelDynamo.com  ""As Amanita Design as it gets."" ~ Chris Priestman, KillScreenDaily.com""Wow !"" ~ Necem, GameSphere.fr""Makes an oustanding impression"" ~ Michał Król,  HCGamer.pl Throughout the whole game, you have to control a main character, Pape, and take care of his friend, Tura.Papetura is a world where everything can be alive.
There are monsters in the darkness waiting for you with different
intentions. During

 the journey, a bird covered with flames awoken by the light will cross your path. You’ll
soon find out that the purpose of your journey is not only to
survive, but also to save the world from the devastating power coming
from the fire of a merciless creature.
Our inspiration from the world of adventure games are great titles such 
as Neverhood and Machinarium, also film productions of studio Ghibli. 
These works have something in common and that is to create a new magical
 world, which is a worthy thing to follow for us! Puzzles and obstacles encountered on the road will be primarily related to the situation. At the beginning, you
have to find a way to escape from the bowel of a monster that has
just swallowed you. Apart from main puzzles, on the way we meet classic mini puzzles molded in the world, made in same techniques as the rest. This design follows such classics as Neverhood (1996), which still inspires us to create this type of adventure game.All we have is one small room and the desk, but it doesn't stop us from work! 
Paper
forms the whole construction of the Papetura world, it begins on paper and ends with a paper composite. Each element of the scene is made of it, even water. After a long process of bonding, the world becomes animated by light and is transferred to the game through photography. Every detail counts and is designed to reflect the architecture style of Papetura.The most important feature of the paper for us is that it takes the color of the light as clothes, at the same time makes it airy and gently. Therefore, the biggest challenge is to make paper model and light work as a whole. It is a time-consuming process, but worth the end result - a realistic fantasy paper-world.The process of making concept, programming, design and coding took us four months of full time job. Most of the time we made mistakes, trying to figure out how to animate paper, how to code in Unity engine and how to get the best result from photography. After this campaign, we are ready to continue the work!Music used in the demo and trailer is ""Saturnin Fire And The Restless Ocean"" and ""Forget-me-not"" by Floex - Tomas Dvorak. His avant-garde approach to sound perfectly reflects the delicate nature of the paper. Will Floex create the soundtrack? The project attracted his attention, but the fate of the soundtrack is not certain. Tomas is a very busy artist, so the decision will be made in mid-year.Meanwhile check out Floex on SoundCloud !We've got to the point where the game won't rise without you!

It's made with the goal of being both easy to learn and simple to play. You can build a deck or play with all the cards. The game was originally planned to be a mini-game to an RPG which turned to a real board game and now an app. It's gone through many revisions and we hope soon to bring it to it's full potential.We currently have a working prototype which you can try out for yourself. The purpose of this Indiegogo Campaign is to help fund a final version of the game which we're going to make from scratch using the prototype as a guide. It will be improved in every way and with funding we can add Multiplayer, better special effects, new modes and more.The game takes place in a fantasy world where all living things are assigned an Element and use them to perform amazing spells and special abilities. However in the Card Game you are a blank slate and every card grants you access 3 unique abilities of that Element to use against your opponent. Using the right spells at the right time and with Elements that complement each other will put you in the upper hand. There are 3 main types of Elements. Elemental Elements are those that can be found in nature like Fire, Water and Earth. Magical Elements exist in nature but can only truly be interacted with and seen by those who are of that Element which include Shadow and Light. Exotic Elements are often seen as the strange and unusual type, some of which don't use mana as a resource. They range from controlling other elements and living things to greatly enhancing one's self to give super human abilities. These include Blood, Nature and Dark.Elements plays similar in mechanics to that of an old turn based RPG and can best be compared with Pokemon. Each player takes turns casting spells and abilities to damage the opponent and leave them with status effects which can be used to enhance other spells. When a player has lost all their HP they lose. Here is a round of gameplay from the prototype to give you a better understanding on how the game is played.

Use the Card Library to look at all the cards and examine every spell and possible combination to build your deck and find your strategy. Every card has a counter and compliments another. Mixed cards are another aspect to consider when building a deck if it suits your approach to the game.
 

Elements is one of the first games we've designed over the span of about 10 years now and has gone through many revisions. The card game was originally planned to be a mini game to a turn based RPG which is the first game we designed of the same name which we also hope to one day make. It started off innocently enough as a game I played in my head while eating candy, when I ate one of a certain color I would obtain that power. Every color is assigned an Element ended up to what we have today.Later down the line we decided to develop it into a board game which the app is now based off. The prototype uses the real cards shown above but in the final version will have new cards made specifically for the app.The prototype of the game shown in the video is free to download and try yourself. It's only available on Android but the Final Version of the game will be on both Android and IOS. Please note that the app is a proof of concept and meant to be a prototype to show what we intend to make and does not represent what the finished product will look like. The final release will feature a lot of what the prototype has but we'll be able to add more and improve the look and feel of the game.Upcoming:

An Idea Is Born 



Thanks for taking a minute to check out our project! We're hoping to raise enough money to do a  first-time production run for the PlayStation 3 version of PhatGrip. We are using the PlayStation version because it's the one that we have closest to a finished design. Final texture is all that's left. If all goes well, the Xbox will follow close behind. OnLive and Ouya controllers are also on our radar. 


I came up with the idea for PhatGrip a few years ago while playing video football with a friend of mine. Our hands were getting sweaty and made the controllers real slippery. If you are a console gamer then you know what I'm talking about! Since there is such an emotional connection when playing video games it's only natural that this happens. It became my mission to find an appropriate solution. The purpose was to create something that would increase the comfort of using these controllers without changing the integrity of the controller itself - and without using adhesives or encasing the entire controller which would obstruct the buttons. I wanted to make actual GRIPS that help the user during game play, not just a protective case. 


 
Prototypes and Feedback


After several design changes, I finally got what I was looking for and put together the cash to have some prototypes made. We (my wife and I) took them to E3 in Los Angeles and allowed everyone we could to get some hands-on time. The feedback fantastic.  


From there, we sent some of the prototypes out for reviews. Once again, the response was fantastic. 


""Phatgrips passed the test with flying colors. Comfortable, and kept my hands from cramping up. One thing I like about them is you can just pull them off, no sticky residue on the controller. But they feel very solid when you play, never felt like they were going to slip off."" ~ Bert Ingley, formerly of www.maddentips.com  


""... once the grips were added it made the controller much easier to hold. I already can't wait to try the 360 version!"" ~ Nikole Zivalich, host of ""The Game Show""  


""PhatGrips are the best accessory you can get for your gaming system hands down. Here at GAU we game for hours and hours and PhatGrips make those hours so much more enjoyable. Everyone should try a pair cause then you'll be hooked."" ~ Trevor from Gamers Are Us  


Those prototypes were made of urethane. We will be using santoprene ( http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-santoprene.htm ) for the final product. This material will allow us to create a very high grade product with plenty of durability. 


 


Where we are now  


At this point in time, we are almost ready to do a first time production run of 5,000 shelf-ready units for the PS3 version. This is the ""test"" sales run for that idea I had years ago. 


This is where you come in. 


With your help, we'll be able to take this project out of my garage and into a production run, get them in the hands of gamers and see if our idea/unique design will work for the millions of gamers out there. If it does well, we will be able to provide an array of colors as well as possibly some neat artsy designs on them - maybe even some of your designs!  


We plan to selling the product through a combined effort of our website and  Amazon.com's Fulfillment By Amazon program with a retail price of $14.99 per set.  


 



Where the money will go:  



Mold cost  


Mold Setup fee 


Final Prototype Run for texture/design check 


Final patent (we have filed a provisional) 


Injection/production cost for 5,000 sets 


Shelf-ready packaging 


Product Fulfillment through Amazon Fulfillment and our website 


Upgrading our website 


 


Timeframe 


Once we’re funded, the plan is to have one more run of prototypes done to finalize design, fit, texture, feel. There will be 12 sets of prototypes.  Turn around  time on the prototypes is about 2-3 weeks.  We expect to take additional 2 weeks to hand test the final texturing and integrity of the prototypes. 


After we’re confident the prototypes emulate the product, we’ll contact our manufacturer to begin production. Turn around time here is approximately 8 - 12 weeks (includes mold building time). 


When the products arrive here in Reno, we’ll take it to a local packaging plant to have the clam shells and inserts done.  Turnaround time is around 10 business days. 


Altogether, we're looking at around 17 - 20 weeks. Of course, we'll update progress on each step of the way.

<p>When it comes to business, most people will tell you fail fast, and then learn. But the truth is... <strong>FAILING SUCKS</strong>.</p>
<p>Being entrepreneurs, we realized that no amount of reading could prepare us for disappearing partners, dealing with suppliers and D-cal's parents wondering what the hell he was doing with his life. This is why experience matters.</p>
<p><strong>No existing board game for business simulates experience.</strong> That is until now...</p>

<p><strong>There's a statistic stacked against every would-be entrepreneur, 9 out of 10 businesses fail in their first year. About 120,000 businesses fail every day.</strong></p>
<p>This is why this matters for us. If we can interrupt that status quo, make the first steps of starting up a little bit easier and empower more people to succeed, then we've done our job.</p>
<p>Imagine kids learning business at an early age in a risk free and fun environment. Imagine would-be entrepreneurs, before quitting their job, playing UPSTART to gauge how prepared they are to take the leap. We want to jumpstart a worldwide entrepreneurial movement.</p>

<p>D-cal, a self-proclaimed gamer and a teacher (with a little under a decade of experience), was running a business together with Ina for about 3 years. It wasn't easy...</p>
<p>Despite some successes, failures came more often than not. A mix of mismatched expectations, debt and doubt pushed D-cal into a depression.</p>
<p>D-cal locked himself up in a room for a week and used all that frustration, all of the learnings and all of the stories he's read and heard from other entrepreneurs to create Upstart Mk1.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480033317/zsnboepeoyu1mbwglasv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><strong>UPSTART works like a role-playing game (RPG).</strong> You start by choosing a background that gives you various advantages and disadvantages while you build your business (e.g. full-time employee has steady income but less time while full-time entrepreneur has no income until the business profits but has time). </p>

<p>Also one of the unique gameplay aspects of UPSTART is that with enough players you can assign a ""game master"" (much like the dungeon master in Dungeons and Dragons). This ""game master"" which we call ""The Invisible Hand"" can re-interpret the rules, create new scenarios and challenges and even add new cards to the game. The Invisible Hand is pretty much like God in the game and also affects players by pulling out ""God's Hand"" or ""Market Shift"" cards.</p>

</div></div>","When it comes to business, most people will tell you fail fast, and then learn. But the truth is... FAILING SUCKS.
Being entrepreneurs, we realized that no amount of reading could prepare us for disappearing partners, dealing with suppliers and D-cal's parents wondering what the hell he was doing with his life. This is why experience matters.
No existing board game for business simulates experience. That is until now...


There's a statistic stacked against every would-be entrepreneur, 9 out of 10 businesses fail in their first year. About 120,000 businesses fail every day.
This is why this matters for us. If we can interrupt that status quo, make the first steps of starting up a little bit easier and empower more people to succeed, then we've done our job.
Imagine kids learning business at an early age in a risk free and fun environment. Imagine would-be entrepreneurs, before quitting their job, playing UPSTART to gauge how prepared they are to take the leap. We want to jumpstart a worldwide entrepreneurial movement.
In summary:





D-cal, a self-proclaimed gamer and a teacher (with a little under a decade of experience), was running a business together with Ina for about 3 years. It wasn't easy...
Despite some successes, failures came more often than not. A mix of mismatched expectations, debt and doubt pushed D-cal into a depression.
D-cal locked himself up in a room for a week and used all that frustration, all of the learnings and all of the stories he's read and heard from other entrepreneurs to create Upstart Mk1.

He cut hundreds of pieces of paper himself. Looked for toys laying around the house to use as the first tokens and then called Ina and his friend, Jolo, to play the very first game.
Something clicked. We were on to something.
The next two years would be about testing. We refined and polished the game. Balanced the fun parts with the learning. We did seven major over-hauls. 

After a small print run (with a lot more learning about how manufacturing works) and over 400 test-players from around the world from different walks of life, we're now ready to print a NEW and IMPROVED version to reach international shores.

<p>Almost 3 years ago we decided to build our own online world, in which players could immersive themselves in a highly realistic medieval environment, and so LIFE IS FEUDAL was born. Being huge MMORPG fans, and being fans of medieval-themed titles, a realistic medieval scenario was an easy choice for us as a setting.</p>

The quality of our current game is a testament to our commitment and love for what we do, and if anyone doubts that a start-up team can accomplish the impossible and build a large and vast MMORPG, check out LIFE IS FEUDAL! For the past 3 years we have worked very hard and diligently on putting together the most impressive PC Sandbox MMORPG. </span></p>

Ultimately, because LIFE IS FEUDAL is for gamers built by gamers, the decision to get the gaming community (You!) involved in the continued development of our project was an easy one to make.</span><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>LIFE IS FEUDAL has a tentative official release date of 2015, but this is subject to <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">change and does not mean the game will not be available to download and play </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">online a long time before that! The truth is, we plan to have an early ALPHA available right after <b>successful </b></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">finish of this campaign, and next year in 2014, there will be additional content and features added to the game, taking it to the BETA level. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Supporters of LIFE IS FEUDAL can gain early exclusive access to playable code by pledging to some of our perk options outlined on the right side of this page. Developing a MMORPG is an everlasting process and never truly ends. But we strive to make as much content and as many features available as quickly as possible, especially because feedback and support is important.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Payment model is planned to be a <b>B2P</b>. Players will be able to download and enter game for free and will appear on a newbie island. While suffering different limitations, they will be able to test all of game mechanics and most of it features. And if they feel confident enough to leave safe newbie island and dive into the real medieval life on the main Continent, they will have to pay <b>only once</b>.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We will place you name and/or nickname in the Hall of Fame of our game on the website and the in-game credits page. Many years from now you will be able to tell your children that you helped trigger a new era of sandbox games. :)</p>
<h3>Titles</h3>
<p>Game Supporter, Proud Game Supporter, “Untouchable Game Supporter”. These titles will be available to all of your characters, so other players can observe them and feel how pathetic they are :). Also, if you choose the “Untouchable Game Supporter” Title to be visible and you are murdered by some PvP hungry outlaw, that outlaw will suffer a slightly higher alignment hit. That will teach him to avoid killing great supporters like you! ;)</p>
<h3>Game purchase</h3>
<p>Starting from a “well” reward tier you will be considered as a buyer of our game. That will give your characters a free ticket on a ship to the Main continent from the Newbie Island. Other players will have to spend real currency to buy these tickets.</p>
<h3>Access to closed forum section</h3>
<p>Way to effect on our Lore by taking active part in debates on the main continent and starting city names. Also, you will have access to alpha/beta tester forums and read their reviews, in case you were not lucky enough to get into earlier tests.</p>
<h3>Increased “Authority” skill</h3>
<p>This skill allow you to claim land for your personal control to build your own cozy farm, garden or bandit camp. Skill progression will be based on the amount of time you successfully maintain that claim. Players with this reward will have an increased base amount of the skill. This will allow them to claim significantly more land at the start of open Beta tests and at release!</p>
<h3>Early access to the closed Alpha/Beta Tests</h3>
<p>For all of you who cannot wait and want to dive into our medieval massive sandbox world, that is the right rewards for you.</p>
<p>Instant Closed Alpha Access - as soon as our campaign will be successfully finished, you will be able to download our client and join the alpha testing</p>
<p>Closed Alpha II Phase Access - aprox. in 2 month after the start of Closed Alpha tests</p>
<p>Closed Alpha III Phase Access - aprox. in 2 month after the start of Closed Alpha II tests</p>
<p>Closed Beta I Phase Access - date strongly depends on success of our campaign, extra funds we might get and overall amount of problems that needs to be solved during Alpha tests. As a rough estimate, that should be a Summer/Fall of 2014</p>
<p>Closed Beta II Phase Access - aprox. in 2 month after the start of Closed Beta tests</p>
<p>Keep in mind that early access will be provided to the Alpha/Beta testing phases, so please, be prepared to some glitches and bugs and report them on the way. The more reports you will do - the faster we will fix them.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Rental</h3>
<p>Starting City will be an only safe place in an endless storm of feudal life happening around it. Our backers will be able to claim land in city protected radius, which will guarantee protection of their assets in any circumstances! Aside from that, certain backers will have an estate property behind city walls that will be free of rent for first 6 month of Open Beta and Release. That property can be used freely, as for aesthetic purposes, as your bind point or simply to stash your belongings.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that we will let you choose any house out of the same types, but those who had backed first will be picking those houses first. So be fast with that, or you might end up with only some variants in slum district of Starting City ;)</p>

<p>Our campaign has a target goal of 200,000.00 Euros, as this amount of funding <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">allows us to complete the development of LIFE IS FEUDAL, and develop all of the </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">features described above. But that is only the beginning! Should we accomplish </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">additional funding we have defined a number of stretch-goals enabling us to </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">expand our MMORPG even further! LIFE IS FEUDAL is an ever expanding universe, </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and in an effort to constantly and continuously offer our players the ultimate gaming </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">experience, the game must be allowed to expand, evolve, and grow over time. We </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">have defined a number of key-features and estimated their costs as stretch-goals, and we are confident these additions will add new dimensions to our MMORPG.</span></p>
<p><b>Our first stretch-goal of 275,000.00 Euros</b> adds a complex ecosystem to the game. The objective is to expand on the games realism where latitude affects weather <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">patterns, and where rain will affect farming culture growth rates and harvest amount. The amount and toughness of wild animals is directly related to the number of players and buildings in certain areas. The stretch-goal also adds complex animal taming and breeding.</span></p>
<p><b>Our second stretch-goal of 330,000.00 Euros</b> offers players the feature to freely <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">place furniture and decorative items inside of caves, houses, and buildings with great precision!</span></p>
<p><b>Our third stretch-goal of 440,000.00 Euros</b> offers players the ability to place certain type of walls, windows, doors, stairs and other housing modules on the game grid, resulting in your own unique house plan that you can complete and decorate.</p>
<p><b>Our next stretch-goal of 570,000.00 Euros</b> is a major enhancement to the game and <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">includes a full-scale naval transportation and combat system! By reaching this goal LIFE IS FEUDAL will include Cogs and Hulks (with possible in-game invention of Caravel and Carrack ship types) roaming around rivers, lakes, and seas for movement of trade goods, troops, piracy or simply for leisure exploration.</span></p>
<p><b>Our final stretch-goal of 700,000.00 Euros</b> offers players everything they will ever <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">need to turn their depleted mine tunnels into a full-scale dungeons maze with doors, traps, and monster spawns, and treasure spots.</span></p>

First live stream:

Campaign is closed
It is obvious, that we will not be able to meet our goal. There are numerous reasons for that and some of them is our fault too, but we could not change it much, since the campaign had started. 
Still we are going to survive according our Plan ""B"" ;) Please, register on our site: lifeisfeudal.com and wait for additional news. Second stream containing some combat moments of our Sandbox MMORPG is going to be soon. Stay tuned!



old campaign text:
We are thrilled that you have decided to check out our game project LIFE IS FEUDAL, and we are excited to have the opportunity to explain to you what we are trying to achieve! Everyone on our team are highly experienced gamers, and we just can’t get enough of hardcore MMORPG games! 
Almost 3 years ago we decided to build our own online world, in which players could immersive themselves in a highly realistic medieval environment, and so LIFE IS FEUDAL was born. Being huge MMORPG fans, and being fans of medieval-themed titles, a realistic medieval scenario was an easy choice for us as a setting.
Although our team doesn’t have a large rolodex of past titles, LIFE IS FEUDAL comes from the heart. The quality of our current game is a testament to our commitment and love for what we do, and if anyone doubts that a start-up team can accomplish the impossible and build a large and vast MMORPG, check out LIFE IS FEUDAL! For the past 3 years we have worked very hard and diligently on putting together the most impressive PC Sandbox MMORPG. 






We have come incredibly far, but need your support! We have reached a point where additional external funding is required for us to complete the development and release our game, and we spent many nights and days weighing our options. Ultimately, because LIFE IS FEUDAL is for gamers built by gamers, the decision to get the gaming community (You!) involved in the continued development of our project was an easy one to make.







Set in a highly realistic environment, LIFE IS FEUDAL challenges you to go back in time and discover living medieval life. Your objective is not only to survive, but to find a way to prosper, build, or join an existing community. How would you fend for yourself? Where would you live? 


How would you defend against and fight off other players and predators from the wild? Will you establish, or will you join a peaceful community, and would you even if you could? 




Perhaps you are the Mercenary type looking for solitude and isolated living. Become a conqueror. Or a wanderer. The choice is ultimately yours, and LIFE IS FEUDAL offers you the freedom to create your own destiny and challenges you to thrive and survive.






LIFE IS FEUDAL can be summarized as a massive Sandbox PC MMORPG with advanced features catering to gamers looking for the ultimate online gaming experience! Set in a vast and realistic medieval environment, the game offers a large persistent seamless world, in which its players can freely roam and participate.
While LIFE IS FEUDAL is free-to-play, its full potential can only be experienced by acquiring a license (buy-to-play). Players are allowed to explore and roam a free continent almost without restrictions, giving a sense of the games full scope, complexity, and gameplay.




LIFE IS FEUDAL offer a host of incredible features making our game truly unique! It offer something for everyone, and the diverse and varied gameplay is enhanced by our continued commitment to adding new and cool stuff over time! Backers of this campaign will enjoy unlimited hours of adventuring, and very few players will ever be good enough, or skilled enough, to explore the rich and massive environment! Here is a quick breakdown of our games main features:


Massive Seamless Open-Ended World. LIFE IS FEUDAL features a massive 441 square kilometer open seamless world! Our game has island-like continent with different biomes such as plain, dense forest, steppe, desert, tundra and marsh, for example. All of the terrain is untouched nature inviting players to settle or invade! The continent is scattered with rivers, lakes and bays, and even has a roaring volcano!

Free Terraforming & Tunnel Building. LIFE IS FEUDAL features 100% free terraforming and tunnel building! Dig tunnels, mines and moats, and expand them in all dimensions almost without limitations! You can raise and lower ground levels with a land-fall effect. Substances include soil, rock, granite, ore veins, clay, sand, and many more!


Free Modular & Predefined Construction of Buildings & Objects. LIFE IS FEUDAL features more than 100 buildings and objects! Most buildings can be placed anywhere with free rotation and are predefined. Fortifications are modular allowing you to design and build your own unique castles with pattern, towers, gates etc. You can even place palisade walls and fences.


Rich Crafting System. LIFE IS FEUDAL features a crafting system with more than 500 recipes, including but not limited to mining, smelting, forging, logging, carpentry, construction, masonry, architecture, farming, taming, procuration, cooking, tailoring, fishing and hunting! Crafting is enriched through clever use of mini-games.


Almost Unlimited Number of Unique Alchemy Combinations. LIFE IS FEUDAL features over 40 billion alchemy combinations unique to each player! And unlike other online games you need to learn, experiment and create your very own unique combinations. Alchemy is not just a matter of character skill, as it has strong emphasis on players spending time and resources on creating good recipes and combinations.


Innovative Mini-Games Concept. LIFE IS FEUDAL features a plethora of mini-games that adds immersion and fun to the medieval crafting process, and allows gamers to play isolated parts of the game directly from a browser! Mini-Games offer an opportunity to improve on a given craft, and rewards players with bonuses.

A No-target Combat System. LIFE IS FEUDAL features an advanced no target combat system, where combat can be experienced in either 1st or 3rd person view. There is no lock-on, and players must carry out individual actions such as swing, stab and block, for example. 

Physics-Based Melee & Ranged Combat. Physics come into play as well, as does the quickness of the attacker and defender. A swift use of a sword at a high velocity causes extensive damage.


Realistic Player Damage System. With fractures and bleeding wounds you can create different unique combat tactics.


Full Loot. Added thrill and excitement of your adventures! Also when players die, loss of skill occurs by an alignment factor at random.


Skillcap & Statcap Systems. These will allow you to make almost any combination of skills that you think you need to have. You can design your own unique class and be like no one else in our world. That is the spirit of a true Sandbox!


Private Property & Land Claims. Grab some land for yourself or for your guild too. Divine law will protect your property standing on the claim from aggressors.


Complex Food & Cooking System. Cooking is no longer a secondary or non-existent skill. Being a good cook, who knows a lot of complex and tasty recipes, means that you and your friends or clients will be better fed and will have a skill raise bonuses!


Great selection of Medieval Weapons with Unique Combos & Effects. Up to 55 different medieval tools of killing and hurting. With their own combinations of directional attacks that will cause some harmful effects on your opponent, like knockdown, fracture, bleeding wound, crippled movement and many others!


Great selection of Tools that can be used as Militia Weapons! If you got jumped by some ragged bandit in the middle of your crops field, smash his face with a shovel! That will teach him a lesson.


Double Health & Stamina Bars. Double health and stamina bars represents your body status better. Players can be knocked out or dead, can be temporary out of breath or totally exhausted.


Original Battle Formation System. In massive battles, react accordingly to the combat situation and provide your Unit with a certain bonuses. But to receive these bonuses Unit members must be well organized and always keep formation.


Innovative Battle System. Battles will happen on an instanced server, without interference of 3rd parties, without senseless obstacles and with full statistic records. That is how history of feudal wars will be tracked!

Classic Siege System. As you have seen it in many other online games. Massive clash of players for a one certain castle.

Wild Animals Tracking & Hunting. You can find different tracks of different animals and follow them.



Our feature list is one of the most impressive and extensive for any MMORPG ever to be developed, and includes the very best from existing online games as well as some new, innovative, and groundbreaking additions never before seen! What follows is a brief description of the main features, and throughout the campaign we will provide updates with in-depth information and extensive details giving our backers full insight and clarity of our plans for LIFE IS FEUDAL.




LIFE IS FEUDAL has a tentative official release date of 2015, but this is subject to change and does not mean the game will not be available to download and play online a long time before that! The truth is, we plan to have an early ALPHA available right after successful finish of this campaign, and next year in 2014, there will be additional content and features added to the game, taking it to the BETA level. 
Supporters of LIFE IS FEUDAL can gain early exclusive access to playable code by pledging to some of our perk options outlined on the right side of this page. Developing a MMORPG is an everlasting process and never truly ends. But we strive to make as much content and as many features available as quickly as possible, especially because feedback and support is important.
Payment model is planned to be a B2P. Players will be able to download and enter game for free and will appear on a newbie island. While suffering different limitations, they will be able to test all of game mechanics and most of it features. And if they feel confident enough to leave safe newbie island and dive into the real medieval life on the main Continent, they will have to pay only once.




So what do you get for helping us? First of all, a heartwarming feeling that you have helped in creating a new, unique sandbox MMORPG to life! That feeling will be extended into game, giving you a slight sense of nobility.
Please, consider inspecting our rewards:









Credits



We will place you name and/or nickname in the Hall of Fame of our game on the website and the in-game credits page. Many years from now you will be able to tell your children that you helped trigger a new era of sandbox games. :)
Titles
Game Supporter, Proud Game Supporter, “Untouchable Game Supporter”. These titles will be available to all of your characters, so other players can observe them and feel how pathetic they are :). Also, if you choose the “Untouchable Game Supporter” Title to be visible and you are murdered by some PvP hungry outlaw, that outlaw will suffer a slightly higher alignment hit. That will teach him to avoid killing great supporters like you! ;)
Game purchase
Starting from a “well” reward tier you will be considered as a buyer of our game. That will give your characters a free ticket on a ship to the Main continent from the Newbie Island. Other players will have to spend real currency to buy these tickets.
Access to closed forum section
Way to effect on our Lore by taking active part in debates on the main continent and starting city names. Also, you will have access to alpha/beta tester forums and read their reviews, in case you were not lucky enough to get into earlier tests.
Increased “Authority” skill
This skill allow you to claim land for your personal control to build your own cozy farm, garden or bandit camp. Skill progression will be based on the amount of time you successfully maintain that claim. Players with this reward will have an increased base amount of the skill. This will allow them to claim significantly more land at the start of open Beta tests and at release!
Early access to the closed Alpha/Beta Tests
For all of you who cannot wait and want to dive into our medieval massive sandbox world, that is the right rewards for you.
Instant Closed Alpha Access - as soon as our campaign will be successfully finished, you will be able to download our client and join the alpha testing
Closed Alpha II Phase Access - aprox. in 2 month after the start of Closed Alpha tests
Closed Alpha III Phase Access - aprox. in 2 month after the start of Closed Alpha II tests
Closed Beta I Phase Access - date strongly depends on success of our campaign, extra funds we might get and overall amount of problems that needs to be solved during Alpha tests. As a rough estimate, that should be a Summer/Fall of 2014
Closed Beta II Phase Access - aprox. in 2 month after the start of Closed Beta tests
Keep in mind that early access will be provided to the Alpha/Beta testing phases, so please, be prepared to some glitches and bugs and report them on the way. The more reports you will do - the faster we will fix them.
Real Estate Rental
Starting City will be an only safe place in an endless storm of feudal life happening around it. Our backers will be able to claim land in city protected radius, which will guarantee protection of their assets in any circumstances! Aside from that, certain backers will have an estate property behind city walls that will be free of rent for first 6 month of Open Beta and Release. That property can be used freely, as for aesthetic purposes, as your bind point or simply to stash your belongings.
Keep in mind that we will let you choose any house out of the same types, but those who had backed first will be picking those houses first. So be fast with that, or you might end up with only some variants in slum district of Starting City ;)
Starting City view:



Houses types:
Tiny Shack



 

 


Tiny Shack. 1 bind point. A modest peasant shack. Has no door. Good enough to be a part of the city residents and to cover you from rain, but nothing else.

Small Wooden House ...







 

 




and Small Plaster House








 

 



3 bind points. A good 1 story high house for a tight family.

Medium sized Plaster House








 

 




5 bind point inside 2 story medieval city house. A nice looking medieval residence for a small group of well known citizens.

Big Wooden House ...







 

 


and Big Stone House





  

 



10 bind points. A massive house that can fit a whole small guild in, with firepit in the center and a balcony.

City Keep





  

 



A dominant of the outer city walls. A place fitting a governor of the Starter City. Multistory building with a good view on all 4 sides of the city.
Be a King of our World!
We will take your name or nickname as a base of the name of our Lore king! Your name will be mentioned as a historical figure that had personally led a successful expedition towards new lands. Also, you will have an exclusive rental rights on the Starter City Castle for first 6 month of Open Beta and Release. That Castle keep and its inner ward will be available to you, so you can build additional structures or raze those you don’t like! And that in the heart of the protected city. All hail the king!

Our campaign has a target goal of 200,000.00 Euros, as this amount of funding allows us to complete the development of LIFE IS FEUDAL, and develop all of the features described above. But that is only the beginning! Should we accomplish additional funding we have defined a number of stretch-goals enabling us to expand our MMORPG even further! LIFE IS FEUDAL is an ever expanding universe, and in an effort to constantly and continuously offer our players the ultimate gaming experience, the game must be allowed to expand, evolve, and grow over time. We have defined a number of key-features and estimated their costs as stretch-goals, and we are confident these additions will add new dimensions to our MMORPG.
Our first stretch-goal of 275,000.00 Euros adds a complex ecosystem to the game. The objective is to expand on the games realism where latitude affects weather patterns, and where rain will affect farming culture growth rates and harvest amount. The amount and toughness of wild animals is directly related to the number of players and buildings in certain areas. The stretch-goal also adds complex animal taming and breeding.
Our second stretch-goal of 330,000.00 Euros offers players the feature to freely place furniture and decorative items inside of caves, houses, and buildings with great precision!
Our third stretch-goal of 440,000.00 Euros offers players the ability to place certain type of walls, windows, doors, stairs and other housing modules on the game grid, resulting in your own unique house plan that you can complete and decorate.
Our next stretch-goal of 570,000.00 Euros is a major enhancement to the game and includes a full-scale naval transportation and combat system! By reaching this goal LIFE IS FEUDAL will include Cogs and Hulks (with possible in-game invention of Caravel and Carrack ship types) roaming around rivers, lakes, and seas for movement of trade goods, troops, piracy or simply for leisure exploration.
Our final stretch-goal of 700,000.00 Euros offers players everything they will ever need to turn their depleted mine tunnels into a full-scale dungeons maze with doors, traps, and monster spawns, and treasure spots.

<li>I put aside secondary features to be able to focus on the main gameplay, to make sure it’s fun and it behaves like real water polo. Gameplay is king</li>
<li>Although it would be easier to develop this game based on previously released water polo video games (if they existed), it’s still possible to use video games about other sports as reference</li>
</ul><p> </p><h2>Other ways you can help</h2><p>The success of this campaign greatly depends on how many people we can reach. This is why it’s so important that you tell your friends about it.

</div><p> </p></div>","Hi, my name is Eric, and I’m proud to present Water Polo Revolution, the video game that water polo fans have always been waiting for!Being able to connect my career as a game developer with my passion for water polo has been a privilege. I’ve been developing this game for the past two years, with a great response and support from the water polo community, which is how I know I’m on the right path.The game is a realistic simulation of water polo. You’ll be able to perform all the most important actions a water polo player can perform in real life, like different types of passes, shots, movement, and strategies. I’m working hard to make the gameplay really feel and behave like the live sport. Key Features
Perform all kinds of shots (skip shot, lob shot, backhand shot, sweep shot, wet shot, hesie shot)
Perform all kinds of passes (dry pass, wet pass, lead pass)
Protect the ball and turn the opponents
Build defense and attack strategies for your team
Call plays during the match to confuse your opponent
Create and customize your characters
  Game modesExhibition MatchA single match between any 2 teams of your choice. Supports single player mode (you against the computer) and local multiplayer mode (you against another person using the same machine).Tournament Mode You’ll be able to play existing tournaments (like a world cup), or create your own. You can choose which teams will participate, and which format will be used (knockout, groups, or a mixture of both).Ultimate ChallengeIn this single player mode, you’ll choose (or create) a team to play against increasingly difficult opponents, each one of them with a unique playstyle that will demand different strategies from you. Will you be able to beat the final boss?You can only progress to the next opponent after defeating the previous one. The fewer matches you need to defeat them, the greater your final score. A scoreboard will keep track of the best players in this game mode, and allow you to compare your performance with your friends’ performances.  PlatformsThe game will be available via Steam, to be played on PC and Mac.Console versions are not in my plans, at least for now, due to the high investment in time and money.You’ll be able to play the game using a keyboard and a mouse, or any controller. My MissionThese are the main objectives I’m trying to achieve, in order to generate a positive impact with the game, not only on an individual level, but also on a community level:
Simulate the true feeling of playing water polo. Something that can make us feel represented
Provide a fun way to learn the rules and the tactics of the sport
Create interest for water polo in people who aren't familiar with the sport yet
  Why am I running this campaign?I’ve been working alone on this game since the beginning. Taking that into consideration, I think I’m doing a pretty good job. However, the project is huge and demands knowledge over a variety of fields of expertise. Generally, games like this are created by bigger teams. It’s not a job for one person.So, this crowdfunding campaign will allow me to finally build a team to work alongside me, being able to deliver the game faster and with better quality. The money will also be used to hire complementary services, and for necessary acquisitions like software licenses, 3D models, sounds, and images.Without the money, I won’t be able to keep developing the game. The TeamI’m still looking for the right team members. However, during the next few days, I’ll probably be announcing new members, so stay tuned. These are the roles I’m looking for:


Eric Flório (me) - Game Designer
I’ll work primarily as the game designer (the person who plans the mechanics, balances the game, and makes sure it feels good to play). I’ll also take care of project management, marketing, community management, and business related matters.

Amateur water polo player
Degree in Graphic Design
Post graduate certificate in Game Development
Game designer in PSG Football Freestyle (Best Game Big Brands - Big Festival 2018)
Game designer in Muiraquitã (Best Serious Game - SBGames 2018)





Ramon Ferreira - Programmer
His interest in game development started in his childhood, when he used to play with RPG Maker. Later, in 2014, he began to learn Unity, and since then has been working in various projects, from advergames to entertainment games.
His top searches on google are about Artificial Intelligence, Zelda, and Unity performance optimization. He is always ready to spend some time talking about the video game industry, game development, etc.
He is also working on the game Skydome, as a performance developer.

 


3D Artist
Creates 3D models, textures, rigs, and takes care of everything related to the graphic quality of the 3D spaces in the game.

 


UX/UI designer
Responsible for creating the visual identity of the game, especially menus and HUD. Also makes sure the game is easy to navigate and to understand.

 


Sound designer
Creates and integrates sound effects into the game, contributing to make it feel more immersive and responsive.

 Where the money goesThis is a breakdown of the main costs of the project.I’m not including the costs of my own work (game design, project management, etc) in this crowdfunding campaign, because I can make a profit later, by selling the game. This allows me to set the funding goal as low as possible, to maximize our chances of reaching it. Current StateAt this moment, the game allows you to move the characters, pass the ball, shoot towards the goal, and switch between players. However, you can’t play a proper match yet, mostly because the artificial intelligence of the characters is not fully realized. On top of that, there are still a lot of other things to do in order to finish the game. Here are some of those things, in no particular order:
Improve graphic quality
Improve and add new player animations
Create user interfaces (screens, menus, HUD…)
Implement all remaining in-game mechanics, like the different types of shots and passes
Refine camera movement and implement playback
Create tutorials (it will consist of drills you can use to learn and improve your skills)
Finish the development of the artificial intelligence of the players, coaches and referees
Add sound effects and soundtrack to the game
Implement all game modes

 I’ll provide a tool (similar to the game’s customization screen) for you to create the appearance of the character, insert a name, and configure the attributes (you’ll have a certain number of points to distribute between the attributes).You’ll also get your name in the credits, a copy of the game once it launches, and early access to the game.IMPORTANT: this reward will only be available during this crowdfunding campaign. Your own team in the game - $1,885You’ll create an entire team to be shipped in every copy of the game. You'll be able to customize each player (max 13 players), as well as the name and the logo of the team.I’ll only accept real teams/clubs (if you have the rights over it) or completely fictional teams. You cannot use the name or the logo of the team to promote a brand. Still, If you’d like to promote your brand inside the game, send me a message so we can discuss a personalized solution.I’ll keep the rights to alter or remove any element that shows someone else's trademark, inappropriate language, or any other element that could harm the game, the players, or other legal entity.I’ll provide a tool (similar to the game’s customization screen) for you to create the characters, choose the name of the team and a logo to represent it. Risks and challengesThis is the first water polo video game with this scale and complexity to ever be developed, so this is not a trivial task. Every mechanic will have to be built practically from scratch, since there are no other similar games to get inspiration from.However, I have good reasons to believe in a positive outcome:
Since I play water polo myself, I know the particularities of the sport well
For the things I don’t know, I have access to people with great experience in water polo who have been really helpful with this project
I’ll be involving the community in the development process, starting with testing the game since the early stages, to ensure people are really enjoying it. Your feedback will be crucial to make the game better
I put aside secondary features to be able to focus on the main gameplay, to make sure it’s fun and it behaves like real water polo. Gameplay is king
Although it would be easier to develop this game based on previously released water polo video games (if they existed), it’s still possible to use video games about other sports as reference
 Other ways you can helpThe success of this campaign greatly depends on how many people we can reach. This is why it’s so important that you tell your friends about it. Sharing this campaign on your favorite social media will be a huge help. Let’s make this game get to everyone in the water polo community!You can use the share buttons located on the top of this page, or you can just share this link:https://www.indiegogo.com/at/water-polo-revolutionYou can also follow the project on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter. This way you’ll be always up on the progress of the project.

preserving the environment, flora, wildlife, natural sanctuaries and diverse endangered zones, through an entertaining voyage across the world.Join Stella, our protagonist, and her loyal friend “Driver” in an adventure across distinct parts of the world; record taking pictures proof that reveals how deteriorated our ecosystems are and the respective environmental consequences.Help us stop the true intentions of the “T Corporation” through the preservation and recovery of natural areas, creation of innovative technologies and participation in many activities involving humanitarian support and helping with natural disasters.Together we’ll do it!Grant us this wish: Take a moment, listen to our story and help us take this dream project to its finish line!
The Lore Comic  “Stella Save Us!” is an adventure game based around minigames in which the player travels around different places of the world in order to stop the destructive plans of the “T Corporation”, a worldwide corporation that’s guilty of burning forests, melting glaciers, sabotaging researches about global warming, hunting down endangered wildlife, etc. All for the purpose of gathering economical resources.Said minigames will revolve around mechanics and varied perspectives, all with different progressions and upgrades that will allow the player to keep on progressing on the goal. The various locations in these missions are based around environmental biomes such as: 
Fire: Fires, flames, deforestation.
Water: Seas, lakes, rivers.
Grass: Reforestation spaces, botany.
Energy: Cities, recycling zones, spaces of technological development.
The prime tool to battle the emergencies is “Ecoveh”, an eco-friendly vehicle designed by the assistant, equipped with multiple devices, each one appropriate for each type of challenge our protagonist can face.The energy Ecoveh requires, to let our protagonist go into rescue missions and environment emergencies, is based in bio-organic waste, which can be obtained through harvesting activities. Our protagonist is Stella, a well-known photographer, and environmentalist, notable for capturing the wildlife and flora’s beauty around the world, aside from her contributions to ecosystem research. Stella, before turning into an environmentalist would travel around the world portraying what her camera could picture, but faith would change her life after a big forest fire burned a big part of the place where she lives. After that day, her ecological side bloomed together with a worrying doubt: Who could be responsible for the fire that caused so much pain?In one of her many trips, Stella meets driver, who unfolds well as a mechanic and inventor. Since that day they’ve been cultivating an unequalled friendship and fellowship, which has allowed them to travel to the most exotic corners of the planet.In one of her adventures in Antarctica, during her seventh day of exploration, picturing beautiful places and marvelous endangered species, she notices that she’s not only aiming her camera lens at a beautiful herd of penguins with her children, but also what will start the collection of proof against the powerful “T” Corporation.Stella and Driver are in deep trouble, now they’re wanted by the “T” Corporation, whose millionaire businesses can’t be menaced by nothing nor anyone. The T Corporation is a multinational corporation known for shady and non-friendly environmental deals which are covered by the power of money. In this occasion a photography would mark the beginning of a research that could lead the T. Corporation to its knees.The T. Corporation is known worldwide, formed by a multinational group of corporations in different headquarters, it has a maximum goal, achieving the highest economic benefits at all costs, inside this, the words “Ethic”, “Environmental awareness” and “Corporate social responsibility”, are a dead letter, since any sort of practice is valid to them. “The interests of the Corporation will always be above anything else.” - Mr. THis organizations have reached headlines in many research diaries due to their chaotic practices, especially those that harm the environment, the wildlife preservation and such… But to this day, they’ve constantly found a way to stay out of trouble in situations where they’re accused, since proof has never been enough. In Antarctica and thanks to Stella’s picture, the first proof register that could take the T. Corporation to justice hands will start.Stella is in danger; her photos could signify the end of multimillionaire businesses, Mr. T and his corporation will not allow this to happen. The core of Stella Save Us! Merges around diverse environmental emergencies which take on from forest fires to undersea rescues. All these situations are presented through minigames with various mechanics and tools that Stella (along with his partner) must make use of to complete their objectives and save the planet from over-exploitation.Gameplay is always coupled with beautiful pixelated art which emphasizes on beautiful details of our environment.Art and gameplay join forces to create awareness about the unfortunate environmental disasters that harm the world day by day, caused mainly by the egoism of some.Rescue animals, protect forests, help your friends, harvest your beautiful garden, take care of the sea and more in this beautiful adventure with Stella and friends!All levels revolve around different areas that are usually in some type of environmental danger.Visit the garage to take on your missions in your ecological vehicle EcoVeh!(Our beautiful garage, concept art gif)Take a look inside your beautiful house, where you’ll do most of the important things needed to take on your missions, upgrade your car, etc. You will take on environmental emergencies seeking to reestablish, and aid affected areas, product of evil plans by the T Corporation, responsible for the damage and deforestation of green areas, creation of energy that’s not friendly to the environment and machinery that’s destructive to wildlife and vegetation of the planet.Select your mission and go rescue!  Settle up your garden, collect and get energy for your vehicle, which will allow you to attend missions if you have enough bio-fuel. Not everything works as bio-fuel, but research and creation of new technologies requires different materials. Everything can be recycled!  Dynamic and diverse minigames will allow you to enjoy a love letter to games such as Mario Party, where gameplay will always be able to surprise you, with twin-stick shooting, platforming, sidescrolling, bossfights and more. (Forest rescue adventure concept gif)(Ocean adventure bossfight concept art) Each task will become less complicated if you rely on the appropriate tools. Stella’s case is no exception.Through her adventure she’ll find obstacles out of her reach, but this won’t stop her from progressing.With the help of her skillful assistant and some materials, Stella will be able to create new technologies depending of the mission she wants to go for with her work benches, which will be located in the upgrade room.(Upgrade room concept art) The upgrade system for the tools of our vehicle Ecoveh, will be displayed in this panel, where you’ll pick based in a recipe system, what sort of objects to create from required materials, located on the right panel along with the object’s description.Inventory, where you’ll see each one of the materials at your disposal; besides that, in case of having duplicate items you want to reuse, or experiment with, you can go to the recycling system, in which you can place 3 items to create a new one with higher rarity. Discover and collect beautiful collectable objects through each one of the incredible adventures in the world, where you’ll join Stella.Usually, you’ll find them on mission completion or secret locations; these are symbols of memories and support to our protagonist in her objective seeking.How many objects will you collect? Take a peek at your board from the commodity of your house to gaze at stickers and objects you’ve collected. Beautiful!   All donations will be extremely appreciated by the team, because of this, we’ve designed a set of rewards for every amount, we will even, for all donations higher or equal to $15, display their names inside the credits, thanking all these people.Everything is digital, we don’t count on physical rewards sadly, in order to not increase our budget and risk the project’s budget.  REWARD DESCRIPTION

Wallpaper: Pack of high-resolution illustrations of our game, ideal for your desktop PCs or/and mobile-phone wallpaper.

Name in the credits: inside the options menu there’s a credits section, where it’s listed and thanked each person that donated more than $15 to the game.

Closed beta access: Before launch there will be a closed beta in order to test the main functionality of the game and receive feedback through comments, doubts, bug reports, etc.

Digital Art book: a digital book which includes concept art (protagonist, T. Corporation, etc.), photo album including assets (vehicles, enemies, etc.) and an entertaining comic with adventures of our protagonist.

Manual/Digital guide: a digital book that includes tips to enjoy the game appropriately giving respect to character story, various strategies, curious facts, etc.

Collectable design: You’ll design a collectable; you’ll pick where and how will it be achieved.

Portrait/Illustration by Eto2D: Portrait/Illustration of the Backer by Eto2D.

City design: You’ll design a city as a playable area along with the development team. It must be a real city, not a fictitious one. This city will hold NPCs and diverse stories, aside from being a main spot for some levels.

NPC Design: Design a non-playable character (NPC) together with the development team. You can design the story and missions the NPC will deliver aside from the personality, physical appearance and dialogues.

Advertisement in all the game: Throughout the game, in cities and other locations, there’ll be advertisement posters to showcase the control the “T. Corporation” has over the current worldwide economy. Any backer who’s in the appropriate Tier will be able to advertise their ecological organization through these posters (Obviously in a positive manner only, not negative like the T. Corporation).
 Why Indiegogo? We are looking for help from the community to make Stella Save Us! Go beyond what we can achieve through self-funding.The funding goals allow us to hire more programmers and developers, paying extra-workers to fine-tune the game and/or participate in videogame fairs and shows in order to promote the game.If the campaign does not work well, we will unfortunately stop working on the project before it’s fully finished.In order to reduce costs, bugs and time for release date, we’re using the Unity game engine. Our team has been working in Unity, allowing us to focus on gameplay and design instead of developing/struggling with a custom game engine.Unity also allows us to potentially reach other platforms through future updates more efficiently in case we reach proper stretch goals and receive great reception. Micro-company dedicated to creation, development and self-publishing of videogames located in the Valparaíso region, Chile!We believe that videogames are powerful communication sources and a medium to explore new amazing worlds. We’re anxious to connect with people that feel the same for videogames and we have the intention to keep on sharing entertaining, imaginative and inspiring titles in the world.This is the beginning of our journey, this time in support of the environment, we’ll wait for you to follow us. Join us!TEAM- Gonzalo Romero: Programmer/Producer- Mauricio Espíndola Naranjo: Programmer- Jesús Alberto Pérez Valdez: Programmer- Héctor Alvarez: Sprite artist/ Animator- Marisol Arosa: Marketing- Alexis: Music composer and SFX designer. In today’s videogame industry, it’s a pretty big risk to develop something without fearing failure during development or even after the launch. An industry in which every day, new companies are created for videogame development, being their only objective to generate high amounts of money, only watching the result as an economical goal.We’re trying to change this, and with this new challenge, launching a game in which the benefit is not only economical, but to also deliver a message about something that’s currently happening; places in the world coming to an end, animals disappearing and weather that’s changing increasingly, everything a product of man.Ecological awareness using pixels, fun mechanics and an entertaining story, that’s our strategy to let the next generations know the problems that are currently going on in our world. Download our presskit here",58.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Alpha test release coming soon!</p>
<p>I am testing for basic combat bugs / equipment stats and changes / enemy levels and stats  / and more.  If you would like to participate toss me a message (or a donation) to get a copy.  I estimate 5 days from now I should be releasing alpha 1.0 for testing.  I am adding basic ranged, and a character selection screen (which I may disable for this first test).  There are 2 bugs I am also working on now.  And finally I have some more substantial enemies I want to add as in room spawn in traps( IRSITs) :P</p>

<h3>What is Where's the Bard?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509510701/dp6l1uglc5ucrvzb3k3h.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Hello, I am super excited to get this up for everyone to finally see!  I recently designed a really great concept for mobile and I am already over half done with Where's the Bard.  I started it only a few weeks ago around the first of October. I am now in the beginning stages of adding monsters and skill effects / animations.  I have also recently talked to my new friend Eddy who is also excited to start producing the retro game play, boss , rest stop,  etc. -music!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Game company that is currently made up of just myself is call Dark Squared, which accurately reflects the types of games we are interested in releasing.  Here's the awesome logo:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508296379/mzfopkgcxbubjcjmledw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have recently decided to go full time with Where's the Bard, and as such I will need help to finish it.  At this rate the coding will be done in a month, however a lot of time is required for me  to do the pixel art and animations.  There are also additional features I want to add that will extend the cost and time.  So the plan is to produce the original design, and attempt to get help purchasing new artwork for the game.  This is where you can help, below I layout some of the game details and goals and you can get a feel for what exactly we have and what I need. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example Where's the Bard will implement the ability to collect characters with unique classes that you rescue as you play through the game, these characters are added to your main inventory where you can choose to start with them instead of a base class when you begin a play through.  That said, I will release one of each rare characters to those that donate a few dollars!  I also had the idea to release a free version and a cheap ad-less version, of course everyone that donates will get the ad-less version as a thank you!</p>

<h3>Additional Goals</h3>

<p> </p>
<h3>More Game Details</h3>
<p>I have about 20 unique monsters each with 3 skills and a base attack, their difficulties will scale with the dungeon levels.  Monsters will be scattered throughout the levels in a balanced manner. Some of these monster types include:</p>
<p>Blue Ooze, Red Ooze, Dark Ooze, Light Ooze</p>
<p>Minor Ghast, Raging Ghast</p>
<p>Zombie Civilian, Zombie Mage, Zombie Priest, Zombie Giant</p>
<p>Skeleton Warrior, Skeleton Priest, Skeleton Mage, Skeleton Knight</p>
<p>These as well as several simple monster types such as bats, spiders and flaming skulls, etc.. And of course elite mobs and boss mobs are in development now I will need an artist to further design new bosses!  A couple dozen wouldn't be a bad number to shoot for with them I think.  At least for the original game release.</p>
<p>The largest aspect of the game are the skills, there are 4 skills and a base attack for each character class, and there are over a dozen classes!  Skills such as various healing, lunging and stunning types, and much more!  There are over 50 skills not including the monster skills!</p>

</div></div>","Alpha test release coming soon!
I am testing for basic combat bugs / equipment stats and changes / enemy levels and stats  / and more.  If you would like to participate toss me a message (or a donation) to get a copy.  I estimate 5 days from now I should be releasing alpha 1.0 for testing.  I am adding basic ranged, and a character selection screen (which I may disable for this first test).  There are 2 bugs I am also working on now.  And finally I have some more substantial enemies I want to add as in room spawn in traps( IRSITs) :P
 
 
What is Where's the Bard?
 

Hello, I am super excited to get this up for everyone to finally see!  I recently designed a really great concept for mobile and I am already over half done with Where's the Bard.  I started it only a few weeks ago around the first of October. I am now in the beginning stages of adding monsters and skill effects / animations.  I have also recently talked to my new friend Eddy who is also excited to start producing the retro game play, boss , rest stop,  etc. -music!
 
The Game company that is currently made up of just myself is call Dark Squared, which accurately reflects the types of games we are interested in releasing.  Here's the awesome logo:

 
 
I have recently decided to go full time with Where's the Bard, and as such I will need help to finish it.  At this rate the coding will be done in a month, however a lot of time is required for me  to do the pixel art and animations.  There are also additional features I want to add that will extend the cost and time.  So the plan is to produce the original design, and attempt to get help purchasing new artwork for the game.  This is where you can help, below I layout some of the game details and goals and you can get a feel for what exactly we have and what I need. 
 
For example Where's the Bard will implement the ability to collect characters with unique classes that you rescue as you play through the game, these characters are added to your main inventory where you can choose to start with them instead of a base class when you begin a play through.  That said, I will release one of each rare characters to those that donate a few dollars!  I also had the idea to release a free version and a cheap ad-less version, of course everyone that donates will get the ad-less version as a thank you!
 

 
The Major Game Elements
[Done]Map generator
[Half Done]UI systems
[Done]Fog and Camera systems
[Half Done]Character systems
Inventory systems
[Half Done]Gear systems
[Half Done]Class systems
monster systems
Locks and lever systems
Skill systems
----------

Additional Goals
Once the original idea is completed I would like to add some extra content if I can reach additional goals.  Regardless though I will attempt to update the game to fulfill all additional content, it will just take longer.
Additional Gear
Additional Map Types
Additional Characters
Additional Monsters
Additional Skills
Additional Bosses
Shaders / lighting effects
Holiday Themes!!
 

 
More Game Details
I have about 20 unique monsters each with 3 skills and a base attack, their difficulties will scale with the dungeon levels.  Monsters will be scattered throughout the levels in a balanced manner. Some of these monster types include:
Blue Ooze, Red Ooze, Dark Ooze, Light Ooze
Minor Ghast, Raging Ghast
Zombie Civilian, Zombie Mage, Zombie Priest, Zombie Giant
Skeleton Warrior, Skeleton Priest, Skeleton Mage, Skeleton Knight
These as well as several simple monster types such as bats, spiders and flaming skulls, etc.. And of course elite mobs and boss mobs are in development now I will need an artist to further design new bosses!  A couple dozen wouldn't be a bad number to shoot for with them I think.  At least for the original game release.
The largest aspect of the game are the skills, there are 4 skills and a base attack for each character class, and there are over a dozen classes!  Skills such as various healing, lunging and stunning types, and much more!  There are over 50 skills not including the monster skills!

always work or they require extra people so we knew we were on the right path.The fun thing is every time I talk to someone new I learn a new use case that I never would have thought of!  If you have any ideas, please share them in the comments :)

We had a great product in mind, now the only thing left to
do was for this entrepreneur and computer scientist to start learning hardware!
Luckily for me, I know lots of founders and engineers of
successful and up and coming hardware companies! I talked to folks at Pebble,
Thalmic Labs, Bufferbox, Palette, Voltera and more! 
The resources around me are great and I’ve been getting tons of support,
answers, connections and ultimately the right direction.
Through trial, error and a lot of learning I was able to
build a prototype from a dev kit, scouring the docs and Bluetooth
specifications to know which advanced features were possible.
I realize that I’m no mechatronics grad and that to do this
right I need to turn to the professionals for help to get me the rest of the
way there.

This isn’t my first time running a company and I’ve learned
to focus on your strengths and hire out passionate people for your
weaknesses.  Enter Inertia Engineering,
an awesome full service engineering firm out of Toronto that helped build
electric cars, motion controlled Bluetooth headsets and F1 racers.
These guys know how to take a product from design all the way through
to fulfillment and they helped walk me through the entire process complete with
timelines, payment schedules for suppliers and things I never even thought of.
This is far from their first rodeo so having
them on board to make sure what you get is done properly, professionally and on
time is the best way I know to make this a reality.
I'm an entrepreneur and computer scientist from the
University of Waterloo who previously ran an accelerator backed gaming
startup which raised $336k from investors. 
I'm an experienced solo founder whose recent feats include winning the Startup
Smackdown judged by famous investor Brad Feld, turning down an acquisition
offer, getting a YCombinator interview, being featured with a picture in the
New York Times, and winning best pitch at the International Startup Festival
2013.
I love creating things and bringing value to people!  I love to talk and have done many pitch
competitions and speaking engagements as well I do a lot of networking.  Because of this I
end up in a lot of situations where the TIYO would be really helpful!
I'm also a huge gamer (if you didn't guess from me running a
gaming startup) and I'm a huge metalhead. 
I've been to over 180 concerts and just booked for my 5th metal cruise
with 70000 Tons of Metal.",19.0,4,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Welcome to my passion project! I am the developer and designer of Fracture Fall. I've been working on the game for a few years now and it is time to see how far we can go with it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Story</strong>. I have played pen-and-paper role-playing games most of my life. To me, a good story is about the choices made on the way. In Fracture Fall, the player choice reigns supreme. Your choices are not only about overcoming challenges, but you are in charge of your own storyline.</p> <p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481883084/v4dxbtdmssgopgv14ap3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><strong>Emergence</strong>. ""Every time you play the game, the story will be different."" When I started my company <i>Two Tales Games</i>, I wanted to make games that always had another story to tell. My philosophy is that there should always be another way to go, an alternative solution to a problem. I thought a lot about the freedom of choice, and how it translates to interesting stories.<br/>While a simulation or a strategy game offers the framework for a story when you look back at all the decisions you've made, it takes some storytelling to complete the experience.<br/>Fracture Fall combines simulated world with well written story elements, so that a unique story emerges with every new game.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484617985/hjeaf1qamprsjb2iq0dk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong>. I love board games and their design. In the world of Fracture Fall there are <a href=""https://youtu.be/HKDNtTTB3kI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">eight rivalling AI-controlled </a><a href=""https://youtu.be/HKDNtTTB3kI"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>factions</i></a>. Behind the scenes, they act like players of a board game. Factions make decisions for their own benefit, and their constant competition keeps the world dynamic and alive.<br/>Decision-making, diplomacy and trade of the factions are simulated. The player is one of the pieces on the board, but with agency and momentum. The player's actions can affect the simulation, tilting the balance of power in favour of one faction or another. This lets the player be political or opportunistic in a world that has a momentum of its own.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481895603/j6r0stp4vbx0sykkjcfw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Game Mechanics. </strong>I think about game mechanics a lot. To me, they define the boundaries of what is possible in a game world. Game Mechanics create direction and purpose to the player, and are the vehicle to player's motivations. Some would consider game mechanics to be <i>the</i> <i>game</i>, but they need to be in chorus with the spirit of the game world. I talk more about the summary <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-tPlHU8N9g"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">game mechanics in a developer vlog</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Immersion</strong>. I have worked as a 3d artist for quite some time, and I am responsible for most of the graphics in the game. I am also a dabbling composer, and I swear by the audiovisual impact in a game: the mood created by graphics and music complements the story, and together they create the game experience.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481892250/jafozs9plbamnsptaojk.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p><i>One of the rewards is a miniature of a space station 3d -printed from a highly detailed model and delivered to you.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>I believe that in science fiction you only need to change one thing from what we have now, and it will be keep you busy trying to realize the many ways it changes the world: what technology we have, how societies work, what we believe in and what are the aspirations of mankind. The Fracture changes all of it. Humanity is capable of such wonderful dreams, as well as terrible nightmares.<br/>The Fracture is not just a dimension of space, but it is a <strong>psychic dimension</strong> that resonates within the human mind. It introduces an aspect of philosophical terror to the game. Interstellar travel may depend on it, but the cost may be the humanity in us. If it brings about a human paradigm shift, should the transhumanist agenda be embraced? Or is it a fight against extinction, as the holy Church teaches us after the calamities of the Old Earth?</i></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Crowdfunding</h3>
<p>If you've watched the gameplay trailer and are still reading this, maybe you get it. I feel like there is room for a game like this, and I am trying my hardest to make it into something special.</p> <p>So far I've been funding the development out of my own pocket, but to make it into the game I want it to be, I am going to need <i>your </i>help. Support and share - it all helps!<br/> </p>
<p>You can probably imagine how a game like this can be expanded - how it screams for more features, an expansive universe with more intricate interactions and deeper storylines.</p>
<p>Depending on the success of this crowdfunding, I have plans to make it a better, more full experience for the player:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have been prototyping a <strong>combat system</strong>, but it will need more work before it is fully realized. I am trying something with a submarine feel to it: limited information and the use of decoys to obfuscate your movements. That blip on the screen can be an enemy vessel, or just as well a remote-operated missile waiting to leap at your ship when it's revealed. You can strap a sensory pack to an asteroid with engines and send it ahead to find out. And<br/>I'd like to add a boarding party combat system as well. It would be a great incentive to get those heavy weapons for your crew, as well as securing a couple of terminator exos.<br/> </li>
<li>More and more <strong>events</strong>, more storylines to support a variety of play styles. I’d like to collaborate with a sci-fi writer. You want to try something exceptional, and find a hidden storyline waiting for you? I want to make that happen!<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Illustrations</strong>. I’d like unique illustrations crafted for each event, or at least for the big ones. There are so many great artists available and I want to use them for this.<br/> </li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481896961/e1eymvhk5aprtz2r9sue.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<ul>
<li>More intricate <strong>simulation </strong>modeling. The trade simulation is already finished and implemented, but I want factions to be more dynamic. There needs to be a point when the factions are ready for desperate measures. I want them to go for resources, exploit each other’s weaknesses and really try to spread their influence and ideologies.<br/>And when the player interferes with the plans of a faction, I want them to hunt the player for it.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Sound design</strong>. I've been toying with an idea of radio broadcasts coming from the planets you visit. It would be a great way of conveying the cultural variety encountered in the sector and add texture to the world.<br/> </li>
<li>More <strong>development time</strong> means more features for the game. It also means more content: local events, the fate of entire planets and worlds. Each colony has the potential to house unique cultures and societies, ambitions and calamities. It also means more options for the player in ships and combat tactics.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Multiple platforms: </strong>if there is enough interest and support, the game will also be released on LINUX and Mac.<br/> </li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484618192/qfgom1wtygnveg7bywys.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Perks:</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Digital copy of the game</strong>: you will receive a digital copy of the game, typically in the form of a <a href=""https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5414-TFBN-1352"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">STEAM key</a>. If there is enough demand for it, a DRM -free digital copy can be made available for download.</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><br/><i>In case of an <strong>early access </strong>key, you will have access to the game pre-launch. This will most likely be a bad value proposition for you. The game will not be ready at this point and there will be bugs. You should only consider this step if you truly want to help with the final stages of development  by submitting feedback and hunting bugs. Or if you have another interests in the content before it is made public.</i></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Miniature</strong>: there will be 3d -printed models of three different sizes available for the backers (I'm referring to them by the diameters of their cores). It’s a model of a full standard space station orbiting all the colonized planets or moons in the sector. It’s a very detailed 3d model, and the smallest details really show on larger miniatures. It makes a great prop for your miniature games, or a collector’s piece on your shelf. These miniatures are easy and a lot of fun to paint due to their level of detail. I will have limited amount of hand-painted models available for order.</li></ul>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Funding and Release Date</h3>
<p>There will be stretch goals through this campaign. First things first though - let’s get this funded!</p>
<p>If the funding succeeds, it gives me a year’s time to work on the game and I see a release date coming at the end of 2017. But if the funding goes over the goal, it’ll probably mean that at the end of this year the game goes to an early access.<br/>I will have more time to add features to the game and the release will get delayed for the next year.</p>
<p>Then again, if the game funding goes over any expectations, I’ll be able to hire people, which will expedite the development. I’ll also be able to collaborate with a writer, sound engineers and illustrators.<br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>This is a fixed funding campaign, which means that<br/>if the target goal isn't reached, all funds collected are<br/>reimbursed to the backers. </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Unfortunately, it also means that any promised backer rewards<br/>aren’t delivered and my plans regarding development of<br/>Fracture Fall will be subject to a revision.</i></p>

Introducing the playable factions in the game.
 
               
 
The Project
Welcome to my passion project! I am the developer and designer of Fracture Fall. I've been working on the game for a few years now and it is time to see how far we can go with it.
 
Story. I have played pen-and-paper role-playing games most of my life. To me, a good story is about the choices made on the way. In Fracture Fall, the player choice reigns supreme. Your choices are not only about overcoming challenges, but you are in charge of your own storyline. 
 
Emergence. ""Every time you play the game, the story will be different."" When I started my company Two Tales Games, I wanted to make games that always had another story to tell. My philosophy is that there should always be another way to go, an alternative solution to a problem. I thought a lot about the freedom of choice, and how it translates to interesting stories.While a simulation or a strategy game offers the framework for a story when you look back at all the decisions you've made, it takes some storytelling to complete the experience.Fracture Fall combines simulated world with well written story elements, so that a unique story emerges with every new game.

 
Strategy. I love board games and their design. In the world of Fracture Fall there are eight rivalling AI-controlled factions. Behind the scenes, they act like players of a board game. Factions make decisions for their own benefit, and their constant competition keeps the world dynamic and alive.Decision-making, diplomacy and trade of the factions are simulated. The player is one of the pieces on the board, but with agency and momentum. The player's actions can affect the simulation, tilting the balance of power in favour of one faction or another. This lets the player be political or opportunistic in a world that has a momentum of its own.

 
Game Mechanics. I think about game mechanics a lot. To me, they define the boundaries of what is possible in a game world. Game Mechanics create direction and purpose to the player, and are the vehicle to player's motivations. Some would consider game mechanics to be the game, but they need to be in chorus with the spirit of the game world. I talk more about the summary game mechanics in a developer vlog.
 
Immersion. I have worked as a 3d artist for quite some time, and I am responsible for most of the graphics in the game. I am also a dabbling composer, and I swear by the audiovisual impact in a game: the mood created by graphics and music complements the story, and together they create the game experience.

 
 
One of the rewards is a miniature of a space station 3d -printed from a highly detailed model and delivered to you.
 
 
 
I believe that in science fiction you only need to change one thing from what we have now, and it will be keep you busy trying to realize the many ways it changes the world: what technology we have, how societies work, what we believe in and what are the aspirations of mankind. The Fracture changes all of it. Humanity is capable of such wonderful dreams, as well as terrible nightmares.The Fracture is not just a dimension of space, but it is a psychic dimension that resonates within the human mind. It introduces an aspect of philosophical terror to the game. Interstellar travel may depend on it, but the cost may be the humanity in us. If it brings about a human paradigm shift, should the transhumanist agenda be embraced? Or is it a fight against extinction, as the holy Church teaches us after the calamities of the Old Earth?
 
Crowdfunding
If you've watched the gameplay trailer and are still reading this, maybe you get it. I feel like there is room for a game like this, and I am trying my hardest to make it into something special. So far I've been funding the development out of my own pocket, but to make it into the game I want it to be, I am going to need your help. Support and share - it all helps! 
You can probably imagine how a game like this can be expanded - how it screams for more features, an expansive universe with more intricate interactions and deeper storylines.
Depending on the success of this crowdfunding, I have plans to make it a better, more full experience for the player:

I have been prototyping a combat system, but it will need more work before it is fully realized. I am trying something with a submarine feel to it: limited information and the use of decoys to obfuscate your movements. That blip on the screen can be an enemy vessel, or just as well a remote-operated missile waiting to leap at your ship when it's revealed. You can strap a sensory pack to an asteroid with engines and send it ahead to find out. AndI'd like to add a boarding party combat system as well. It would be a great incentive to get those heavy weapons for your crew, as well as securing a couple of terminator exos. 
More and more events, more storylines to support a variety of play styles. I’d like to collaborate with a sci-fi writer. You want to try something exceptional, and find a hidden storyline waiting for you? I want to make that happen! 

Illustrations. I’d like unique illustrations crafted for each event, or at least for the big ones. There are so many great artists available and I want to use them for this. 


 

More intricate simulation modeling. The trade simulation is already finished and implemented, but I want factions to be more dynamic. There needs to be a point when the factions are ready for desperate measures. I want them to go for resources, exploit each other’s weaknesses and really try to spread their influence and ideologies.And when the player interferes with the plans of a faction, I want them to hunt the player for it. 

Sound design. I've been toying with an idea of radio broadcasts coming from the planets you visit. It would be a great way of conveying the cultural variety encountered in the sector and add texture to the world. 
More development time means more features for the game. It also means more content: local events, the fate of entire planets and worlds. Each colony has the potential to house unique cultures and societies, ambitions and calamities. It also means more options for the player in ships and combat tactics. 

Multiple platforms: if there is enough interest and support, the game will also be released on LINUX and Mac. 


Transport ship: All Fracture -traversing ships possess the spherical Fracture Core.
 
Perks:
 

Digital copy of the game: you will receive a digital copy of the game, typically in the form of a STEAM key. If there is enough demand for it, a DRM -free digital copy can be made available for download.
In case of an early access key, you will have access to the game pre-launch. This will most likely be a bad value proposition for you. The game will not be ready at this point and there will be bugs. You should only consider this step if you truly want to help with the final stages of development  by submitting feedback and hunting bugs. Or if you have another interests in the content before it is made public.
 

 

Miniature: there will be 3d -printed models of three different sizes available for the backers (I'm referring to them by the diameters of their cores). It’s a model of a full standard space station orbiting all the colonized planets or moons in the sector. It’s a very detailed 3d model, and the smallest details really show on larger miniatures. It makes a great prop for your miniature games, or a collector’s piece on your shelf. These miniatures are easy and a lot of fun to paint due to their level of detail. I will have limited amount of hand-painted models available for order.

Funding and Release Date
There will be stretch goals through this campaign. First things first though - let’s get this funded!
If the funding succeeds, it gives me a year’s time to work on the game and I see a release date coming at the end of 2017. But if the funding goes over the goal, it’ll probably mean that at the end of this year the game goes to an early access.I will have more time to add features to the game and the release will get delayed for the next year.
Then again, if the game funding goes over any expectations, I’ll be able to hire people, which will expedite the development. I’ll also be able to collaborate with a writer, sound engineers and illustrators. 
This is a fixed funding campaign, which means thatif the target goal isn't reached, all funds collected arereimbursed to the backers. 
Unfortunately, it also means that any promised backer rewardsaren’t delivered and my plans regarding development ofFracture Fall will be subject to a revision.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">About game</h2>
<p>     Hi There! My name is Marat Ibatullin, and I created a new card game called: ""<strong>Wonder cards</strong>"".</p>
<p>     Here's how the game works:</p>
<p>     As shown on the video, you set deck of cards facedown. Each takes six cards and take turns pull the card from the player sitting on the right of you. After you pulled, he draws a card from the deck. And so it goes on until someone will gather a combination of cards of the same colour and winning card which is necessary for victory. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>     Cards of the same color at combination must be at minimum four pieces. Every colors in the deck by 8 pieces. (The game can play up to 10 players</strong><strong>)</strong></p>

<p>This year in October, BoardGameTravel.com will charter a bus to take us from Helsinki, Finland to Essen, Germany. Along the way we will go through in Turku, Stockholm, central Sweden and Denmark on our way to Essen.</p>
<p>This will be the first time this will happen, and we hope to make an annual tradition out of it. For the first time, to make sure that there are enough people that would like this to happen, we are using Indiegogo as a way to gather everyone. If it is proved that there is a market, we will keep doing it.</p>
<p>BoardGameTravel.com is a new company that is operated by board game geeks, and aims to provide fun boardgaming experiences in beautiful places. We are only happy with dice, cards and some wooden tokens in our hands, having fun with friends over some cardboard.</p>
<p>Our main line of business will be mini-cons where one can play board games with like-minded hobbyists and visit some interesting and pretty places at the same time. Essen by bus is something that the local board game community in Finland can benefit from, and since we are crossing Sweden &amp; Denmark on the way to Germany, and we have the company anyway, we thought of professionally providing this service to all those along the route that want to come.</p>

<p>Q: How can I contact you? Who are you?</p>
<p>A: Please send an email to contact /AT/ boardgametravel.com with as much information as we need to resolve your issue. Alternatively, you can also send a GeekMail to <a href=""http://boardgamegeek.com/user/boardgametravel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://boardgamegeek.com/user/boardgametravel</a>.</p>
<p>As to who is doing this, you can read all about it at <a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/kreikkaturkulainen"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/kreikkaturkulainen</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Why should I not fly instead?</p>
<p>A: Assuming that you find a good deal, keep in mind that you have to pay for the train from Düsseldorf, an extra piece of luggage, and potentially overweight baggage charges. Also, you are limited in what liquids you can take, fun you can have and games you can bring back undamaged. Friends don't let friends fly to Essen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Will I be bored during the trip?</p>
<p>A: Possibly. But, we will do our best to have fun along the way. We will try to have a bus with tables in it, if we can manage it. There will certainly be some games played on the way. Resistance, Dixit, Werewolf, Wits &amp; Wagers and Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective are just a few of what is being planned. Probably no Eclipse, Bausack or Wings of Glory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Why is the goal set so high?</p>
<p>A: The money raised is needed to cover the costs, which include the bus, 2 drivers and their accommodation, fuel, road taxes, insurance, ferries and Indiegogo fees. A high goal also allows us to offer the lowest ticket price possible. The fixed costs that need to be covered mean that this only works if we have bookings totalling the goal amount.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Can I just wait and see, and book after this campaign is over?</p>
<p>A: Probably not. We will only get as big of a bus as we need, and there is no guarantee of a spot after this campaign. Also, we can not guarantee that the prices will not increase.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What about accommodation at Essen?</p>
<p>A: Once we have a better idea of how many people are coming with the bus, we can attempt to get some good offers from hotels. The sooner you book the bus, the better the offer could be. In general, if you book on your own, you can expect a cost of 75-100 EUR/night, but with proper research, sharing a double or triple room and perhaps a group deal, it can go down to 50 EUR/night. We will be in Essen for 4 nights.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I have already booked airline tickets to Essen, but can't bear missing out on all the fun. What do I do?</p>
<p>A: Talk to your travel insurance provider. Contact the airline, and ask if you can cancel the tickets, change the names on them, or get credit for a future flight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I am bringing a lot of games to trade through the Essen Math Trade, do I have to carry them around?</p>
<p>A: No, we can take them to the Messe for you. If you decide to store them with SpielStorage, you can use your 5 EUR discount for this, and tell your recipients to come and pick them up from the Arctic Union booth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What if I fall ill and can't come to Essen, after I've booked?</p>
<p>A: In this case, you are in the same position as someone holding an airline ticket. We recommend that you have travel insurance, and use it to get your money back. We are actually a little better than an airline, and so we might give you a discount for next year's bus, and/or some of the bonuses and stretch goals mentioned above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q (FI): Why not take the ship to Stockholm from Helsinki instead of Turku?</p>
<p>A: Scheduling. It just doesn't work with the route we need to take.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q (FI): Could we not leave Essen earlier, and catch the previous ship from Stockholm, on Monday during the day?</p>
<p>A: To do that, we would have to leave 5 hours earlier, which means noon on Sunday, before Spiel closes. This means that we would miss out on many last-day deals, and be on a big rush to Stockholm. By taking the ship on Monday night, we can go on our way safely, and even have some time to enjoy Stockholm. If our Swedish friends have any suggestions, we could even go and play all those new Essen games somewhere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q (SE): Is hockey an appropriate topic of conversation?</p>
<p>A: Nej.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Not coming to Spiel by Bus"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/662769/pictures/full/20130215062844-07Not.png?1360938536"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: bottom;"" title=""Not coming to Spiel by Bus""/></p>
<p>It's ok, there's always next year! Maybe.</p>
<p>Tell others, get the word out and help us get there.

If bookingsreach 12500 EUR, everyone gets a copy of the Going Cardboard DVD, the documentary by Lorien Green about the board game culture, which includes a copy of Reiner Knizia's Shoot-Out.
If bookings reach 14500 EUR, everyone gets their choice a copy of Drum Roll or Briefcase or Among the Stars, great games from the Artipia Games catalog.
 

Q: How can I contact you? Who are you?
A: Please send an email to contact /AT/ boardgametravel.com with as much information as we need to resolve your issue. Alternatively, you can also send a GeekMail to http://boardgamegeek.com/user/boardgametravel.
As to who is doing this, you can read all about it at http://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/kreikkaturkulainen.
 
Q: Why should I not fly instead?
A: Assuming that you find a good deal, keep in mind that you have to pay for the train from Düsseldorf, an extra piece of luggage, and potentially overweight baggage charges. Also, you are limited in what liquids you can take, fun you can have and games you can bring back undamaged. Friends don't let friends fly to Essen.
 
Q: Will I be bored during the trip?
A: Possibly. But, we will do our best to have fun along the way. We will try to have a bus with tables in it, if we can manage it. There will certainly be some games played on the way. Resistance, Dixit, Werewolf, Wits & Wagers and Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective are just a few of what is being planned. Probably no Eclipse, Bausack or Wings of Glory.
 
Q: Why is the goal set so high?
A: The money raised is needed to cover the costs, which include the bus, 2 drivers and their accommodation, fuel, road taxes, insurance, ferries and Indiegogo fees. A high goal also allows us to offer the lowest ticket price possible. The fixed costs that need to be covered mean that this only works if we have bookings totalling the goal amount.
 
Q: Can I just wait and see, and book after this campaign is over?
A: Probably not. We will only get as big of a bus as we need, and there is no guarantee of a spot after this campaign. Also, we can not guarantee that the prices will not increase.
 
Q: What about accommodation at Essen?
A: Once we have a better idea of how many people are coming with the bus, we can attempt to get some good offers from hotels. The sooner you book the bus, the better the offer could be. In general, if you book on your own, you can expect a cost of 75-100 EUR/night, but with proper research, sharing a double or triple room and perhaps a group deal, it can go down to 50 EUR/night. We will be in Essen for 4 nights.
 
Q: I have already booked airline tickets to Essen, but can't bear missing out on all the fun. What do I do?
A: Talk to your travel insurance provider. Contact the airline, and ask if you can cancel the tickets, change the names on them, or get credit for a future flight.
 
Q: I am bringing a lot of games to trade through the Essen Math Trade, do I have to carry them around?
A: No, we can take them to the Messe for you. If you decide to store them with SpielStorage, you can use your 5 EUR discount for this, and tell your recipients to come and pick them up from the Arctic Union booth.
 
Q: What if I fall ill and can't come to Essen, after I've booked?
A: In this case, you are in the same position as someone holding an airline ticket. We recommend that you have travel insurance, and use it to get your money back. We are actually a little better than an airline, and so we might give you a discount for next year's bus, and/or some of the bonuses and stretch goals mentioned above.
 
Q (FI): Why not take the ship to Stockholm from Helsinki instead of Turku?
A: Scheduling. It just doesn't work with the route we need to take.
 
Q (FI): Could we not leave Essen earlier, and catch the previous ship from Stockholm, on Monday during the day?
A: To do that, we would have to leave 5 hours earlier, which means noon on Sunday, before Spiel closes. This means that we would miss out on many last-day deals, and be on a big rush to Stockholm. By taking the ship on Monday night, we can go on our way safely, and even have some time to enjoy Stockholm. If our Swedish friends have any suggestions, we could even go and play all those new Essen games somewhere.
 
Q (SE): Is hockey an appropriate topic of conversation?
A: Nej.
 

It's ok, there's always next year! Maybe.
Tell others, get the word out and help us get there. If you do, and we have an extra Going Cardboard DVD or Inquisitio available, you might just get one, shipping included. Just post about this and let us know at contact /AT/ boardgametravel.com, so that we know you did.

<h1>Guinevere's Games is raising money for the first production run of a Reproduction set of Historical Playing Cards</h1>
<p>Hello everyone! </p>
<p>I am a new and small company called Guinevere's Games. My campaign goal is to raise funds to professionally print a new set of historical playing cards.</p>
<h2>Why?  </h2>
<p>For over a year I have been dreaming of producing the Flemish Playing Cards. This is a special set of playing card; they are not your everyday playing cards. They are a specialty playing card. Anyone who loves the history of games or playing card history would probably love to own a set of these cards. I first saw those playing cards and knew that I wanted to share these cards with the historical re-enactors all over the world. I had a strong desire to make these cards so that people could play card games with these playing cards. I wanted them to be used like everyday playing cards.</p>

<h2><b>What's next?  </b></h2>
<p>I approached a printing company to get a quote. After receiving a quote from the printers I found that these cards are more expensive than I thought they were going to be to have professionally printed.<br/></p>
<p>I am in the process of cleaning up the artwork to go to a professional printer. I have approached a printer and have a quote in place. My goal is to be able to make a high quality product to offer the public. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I would love to make my dream of making these cards a come true. With your support my dream will be possible. </span><br/></p>
<p>All we need is you!</p>
<h2>Information on the Playing Cards...</h2>
<p>The playing cards that I am producing will be as close as I can be being historically accurate. What this means is that they will not be printed in modern day playing card stock. </p>
<p>The specifications on the playing cards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Height: 5 inches</li>
<li>Width: 2.5 inches</li>
<li>Paper Type: Cougar natural 130 Lb Double Thick Card Stock - smooth finish</li>
<li>Coating: none</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason behind the uncoated card stock is because cards in the 1400's are not coated. Playing cards did not receive the coating that we are used to today until modern times. I am reproducing historical playing cards for the living history re-enactors to use at living history events.</p>
<p>I have tested this card stock with another set of playing cards I have previously produced called the Moorish Playing Cards. These are reproduction playing cards from 1414-1495. </p>
<p>The Moorish Playing cards <b>do not </b>stick or bind when shuffling or dealing. </p>
<h2>What will this campaign do?  </h2>
<div>It will raise money to buy materials and hire a professional printing company to print the first production run of the playing cards.<p><br/></p>
<h2>Where is the funding is going?</h2>
<div>The majority of the money will be used to have the playing cards printed at a professional printer. Any funds left over, after fulfilling the campaign perks will be used for additional costs related to the campaign, equipment and additional materials for Guinevere's Games towards other projects for playing cards and design changes for the products we currently offer. </div>

<p>Guinevere's Games is a game company that specializes is historical board, dice and playing cards. My company has been around since April 2013. I am small company just starting to get my name out there. I love to research and recreate historical games. Each game is a work of art, and is decorated with celtic inspired knotwork.</p>
<p>I had a strong desire to share my love of history with the world. Guinevere’s Games started to produce hand crafted historical board games to offer to the public in April 2013.  There are so many wonderful historical board games out there that are so much fun! Some of the games that I offer are personal favorites of mine. </p>
<p>I went and picked up the necessary supplies to make my first production run of board games. These games were crafted at my kitchen table. I spent many hours on the computer hunting down historical manuscripts to find the original rules to the games. That is when the magic happened for me, I found the Alfonso X Book of Games dating back to 1283 and I was hooked! I read that manuscript many times and found a world of amazing games. I dreamed of sharing these wonderful games with the world and started Guinevere’s Games. </p>
<div>Over the past year I have discovered many wonderful board, card and dice games. And found a very rich history in the world of games that still continues to amaze me to this day! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h2>What is in it for me?</h2>
<div>Besides the great feeling of  helping launch another Canadian manufacturing business.</div>
<div>We have a bunch of perks from PDF rule books for games to the playing cards that I am trying to produce.<p></p>
<h2><b>PDF Rule Books</b></h2>
<p>A smaller donation will get you a PDF of a single dice game up all the way to the complete book of games in PDF format so that you can try some of the historical dice games people played in 1283!  These rules come from a Spanish book called <b><i>Libro de los Juegos</i>  </b>which was commissioned by Alfonso X of Castile, Galicia and León and completed in his scriptorium in Toledo in 1283. This manuscript was originally written in Castilian Spanish.</p>
<p>The image listed below is one of the PDF rule books that I offer on my company website.</p>
<p>I have rewritten all the rules into modern day english that are easy to understand.</p>
<p>You have your choice of PDF rule books that you want.</p>

<b>Playing Cards </b> </h2>
<p>Medium sized donation will get you the Moorish Playing Cards from 1414 - 1495. </p>
<p>The Moorish Playing cards was a deck of playing cards was was created in Spain in the 1400's. This deck was found by museum staff when they were repairing a manuscript in the Barcelona Museum. </p>
<p>I re-drew the artwork on the sheets of playing cards that were found earlier this year. I took the playing cards to the printers. This is the swords suit from the deck.</p>
<p>These are <b>not </b>tarot cards, even though they appear to be. These cards were used to play everyday card games. This is a full deck of 52 playing cards. There were no Jokers in medieval playing cards. The suits in this deck are Swords, Cups, Coins and Battons (curved sticks). They can be used to play any modern day card game.</p>
<p>The single sword is the Ace for the suit. The king card is the seated figure with the crown on his head. The knight (the card with the horse on it) is the replacement for the queen as they did not have queens in Spanish playing cards at that time. The last face card is the knave(modern day jack).</p>
<p>A friend of mine said that these cards are a beautiful example of playing card history.</p>

<p>These cards will give you a feeling of playing cards like a king of queen! The Flemish playing cards in 1470 were considered a luxury deck of playing cards. The richest nobles or royalty would have owned a deck of these cards. The original cards were handpainted and gilded in gold and silver.  These cards were found in the Burgundian Region. These are the cards that I am producing. The suit system consists of Hunting Collars, Hunting Horns, Hunting Nooses for holding captured game, and Hunting Tethers. </p>
<p>There is a full 52 playing cards in this deck. Similar to the Moorish playing cards, the car that has a 1 suit symbol is the Ace, there is a king, queen and knave (jack).</p>
<p>These cards will be printed on the same stock as the Moorish playing cards.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>What will happen if my goal is exceeded?</h2>
<p>If any additional money is raised, the money will go towards two options. The first option new equipment for my company for wood working. The second option is it will go towards producing more playing cards stock for my company.</p>
<p>I am planning on changing the design of my games so that they are a game box. They will have a storage drawer for the game pieces, or the lid will lift up to show a compartment where the game pieces are stored. </p>
<h2>What happens if my Goal is not reached?</h2>
<p>I am planning on doing an all or nothing campaign. This means that if I do not reach my goal then all the money pledged will be returned to the backers of this campaign.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The design of the playing cards are mostly done. I only have some touch ups left to do to the playing cards. The printer that I am using does excellent work, and I have used them in the past. They provide quick and efficient service.</p>
<p>Shipping will happen as scheduled providing that all shipping address information is accurate. </p>
<p>If you have any questions at all, please feel free to contact me. I will happily answer any questions or concerns that you may have.</p>
<br/><h2>Cash is short. How else can I help?</h2>

Hello everyone! 
I am a new and small company called Guinevere's Games. My campaign goal is to raise funds to professionally print a new set of historical playing cards.
Why?  
For over a year I have been dreaming of producing the Flemish Playing Cards. This is a special set of playing card; they are not your everyday playing cards. They are a specialty playing card. Anyone who loves the history of games or playing card history would probably love to own a set of these cards. I first saw those playing cards and knew that I wanted to share these cards with the historical re-enactors all over the world. I had a strong desire to make these cards so that people could play card games with these playing cards. I wanted them to be used like everyday playing cards.

What's next?  
I approached a printing company to get a quote. After receiving a quote from the printers I found that these cards are more expensive than I thought they were going to be to have professionally printed.
I am in the process of cleaning up the artwork to go to a professional printer. I have approached a printer and have a quote in place. My goal is to be able to make a high quality product to offer the public. 

I would love to make my dream of making these cards a come true. With your support my dream will be possible. 
All we need is you!
Information on the Playing Cards...
The playing cards that I am producing will be as close as I can be being historically accurate. What this means is that they will not be printed in modern day playing card stock. 
The specifications on the playing cards:

Height: 5 inches
Width: 2.5 inches
Paper Type: Cougar natural 130 Lb Double Thick Card Stock - smooth finish
Coating: none

The reason behind the uncoated card stock is because cards in the 1400's are not coated. Playing cards did not receive the coating that we are used to today until modern times. I am reproducing historical playing cards for the living history re-enactors to use at living history events.
I have tested this card stock with another set of playing cards I have previously produced called the Moorish Playing Cards. These are reproduction playing cards from 1414-1495. 
The Moorish Playing cards do not stick or bind when shuffling or dealing. 
What will this campaign do?  
It will raise money to buy materials and hire a professional printing company to print the first production run of the playing cards.
Where is the funding is going?
The majority of the money will be used to have the playing cards printed at a professional printer. Any funds left over, after fulfilling the campaign perks will be used for additional costs related to the campaign, equipment and additional materials for Guinevere's Games towards other projects for playing cards and design changes for the products we currently offer. 

Tell us more ...

                     I am at a fundraiser for the Missing Mutts Awareness Society
Guinevere's Games is a game company that specializes is historical board, dice and playing cards. My company has been around since April 2013. I am small company just starting to get my name out there. I love to research and recreate historical games. Each game is a work of art, and is decorated with celtic inspired knotwork.
I had a strong desire to share my love of history with the world. Guinevere’s Games started to produce hand crafted historical board games to offer to the public in April 2013.  There are so many wonderful historical board games out there that are so much fun! Some of the games that I offer are personal favorites of mine. 
I went and picked up the necessary supplies to make my first production run of board games. These games were crafted at my kitchen table. I spent many hours on the computer hunting down historical manuscripts to find the original rules to the games. That is when the magic happened for me, I found the Alfonso X Book of Games dating back to 1283 and I was hooked! I read that manuscript many times and found a world of amazing games. I dreamed of sharing these wonderful games with the world and started Guinevere’s Games. 
Over the past year I have discovered many wonderful board, card and dice games. And found a very rich history in the world of games that still continues to amaze me to this day! 


What is in it for me?
Besides the great feeling of  helping launch another Canadian manufacturing business.
We have a bunch of perks from PDF rule books for games to the playing cards that I am trying to produce.
PDF Rule Books
A smaller donation will get you a PDF of a single dice game up all the way to the complete book of games in PDF format so that you can try some of the historical dice games people played in 1283!  These rules come from a Spanish book called Libro de los Juegos  which was commissioned by Alfonso X of Castile, Galicia and León and completed in his scriptorium in Toledo in 1283. This manuscript was originally written in Castilian Spanish.
The image listed below is one of the PDF rule books that I offer on my company website.
I have rewritten all the rules into modern day english that are easy to understand.
You have your choice of PDF rule books that you want.

Rule Book for Dice Game Marlotta

 

Playing Cards  
Medium sized donation will get you the Moorish Playing Cards from 1414 - 1495. 
The Moorish Playing cards was a deck of playing cards was was created in Spain in the 1400's. This deck was found by museum staff when they were repairing a manuscript in the Barcelona Museum. 
I re-drew the artwork on the sheets of playing cards that were found earlier this year. I took the playing cards to the printers. This is the swords suit from the deck.
These are not tarot cards, even though they appear to be. These cards were used to play everyday card games. This is a full deck of 52 playing cards. There were no Jokers in medieval playing cards. The suits in this deck are Swords, Cups, Coins and Battons (curved sticks). They can be used to play any modern day card game.
The single sword is the Ace for the suit. The king card is the seated figure with the crown on his head. The knight (the card with the horse on it) is the replacement for the queen as they did not have queens in Spanish playing cards at that time. The last face card is the knave(modern day jack).
A friend of mine said that these cards are a beautiful example of playing card history.

Moorish Playing Cards
 Flemish Hunting Deck
Larger donations get you a 1 deck of the Flemish playing cards, or up to 3 decks of the Flemish playing cards. 

 
These cards will give you a feeling of playing cards like a king of queen! The Flemish playing cards in 1470 were considered a luxury deck of playing cards. The richest nobles or royalty would have owned a deck of these cards. The original cards were handpainted and gilded in gold and silver.  These cards were found in the Burgundian Region. These are the cards that I am producing. The suit system consists of Hunting Collars, Hunting Horns, Hunting Nooses for holding captured game, and Hunting Tethers. 
There is a full 52 playing cards in this deck. Similar to the Moorish playing cards, the car that has a 1 suit symbol is the Ace, there is a king, queen and knave (jack).
These cards will be printed on the same stock as the Moorish playing cards.

What will happen if my goal is exceeded?
If any additional money is raised, the money will go towards two options. The first option new equipment for my company for wood working. The second option is it will go towards producing more playing cards stock for my company.
I am planning on changing the design of my games so that they are a game box. They will have a storage drawer for the game pieces, or the lid will lift up to show a compartment where the game pieces are stored. 
What happens if my Goal is not reached?
I am planning on doing an all or nothing campaign. This means that if I do not reach my goal then all the money pledged will be returned to the backers of this campaign.


Risks & Challenges

The design of the playing cards are mostly done. I only have some touch ups left to do to the playing cards. The printer that I am using does excellent work, and I have used them in the past. They provide quick and efficient service.
Shipping will happen as scheduled providing that all shipping address information is accurate. 
If you have any questions at all, please feel free to contact me. I will happily answer any questions or concerns that you may have.
Cash is short. How else can I help?

<p><strong><img alt=""Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1138.photobucket.com/albums/n523/FarerLychnis/Promotion/officialPoster.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Logo""/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p>Hello! I'm an Indie developer from Korea and I need your help to finish my browser game!</p>
<p>'Three Kingdoms Battle' is a turn-based tactics and management game based on the popular Chinese history novel '<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a>'</p>
<p>Pick your side, rally generals, arm your troops and battle it out against other human opponents while relying on your logistic skills and cunningness to win!</p>
<p>My main focus with this title is to try and create the first pure browser game for E-sports in the world!</p>
<p>I do believe that, with your help, I can provide players with a satisfying game which they can play both casually and on a competitive level.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">So what's the plan?</span></strong></p>
<p>In its current state the game is running in open Beta and is accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>To get a general feel what it's about be sure to try playing it online at <a href=""http://www.threekingdomsbattle.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.threekingdomsbattle.com/</a></p>
<p><em>Note: Be sure to turn your speakers on to hear the music!</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If everything goes smoothly I'm hoping to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>January 2013      – creating better graphics and portraits;</li>
<li>February 2013    – releasing official service;</li>
<li>March 2013        – activate various leagues;</li>
<li>Afterwards...       – game on!</li>
</ul><h3><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span></h3>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What will the money be used for?</span></strong></p>
<p>Because I'm more of a developer than a designer I can not provide high quality visual elements.</p>
<p>Fund raised here will, first of all, be spent on creating graphics to make for a better user experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Next come the in-game officer portraits.</p>
<p>During the Chinese “Three Kingdoms” period there were roughly at least 500 different generals!</p>
<p>I would like to, with your help, make sure each and every one of them gets a unique picture showing them in all their might.</p>
<p>So after the basic imagery is updated my next step is to commission artists who'll create these additional portraits.</p>
<p><br/> Lastly: I do not have enough money to afford to pay for publishing.</p>
<p>In order for this game to reach it's full potential, all leftover cash will be spent on helping it go as far as possible!</p>
<p>You can achieve the perk by contribution.</p>
<p><br/> Bear in mind that all of your contributions will be spent exclusively for development, graphics and publishing.</p>
<p>I'll be providing regular updates about the game to everyone who contribute whenever I make any progress.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What are the main features?</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1) </strong><strong>The whole game is HTML5 based!</strong></p>

<p>This means that you can play the game on your device of choice.</p>
<p>No download necessary. Just open your browser, connect and play!</p>
<p>Your experience will be the same whether you play it on a Tablets or a PC.</p>
<p>I'm also preparing another interface for smart-phones, so stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>2) </strong><strong>Say 'No' to pay2win!</strong></p>
<p>'Three Kingdoms Battle' is aiming to be a game for E-sports.</p>
<p>Much like 'StarCraft' or 'League of Legends', in-balance is of the utmost importance!</p>
<p>This means there won't be any items or anything to always shift the fight in one players favor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3) </strong><strong>Dynamic battle system!</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""rain"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1138.photobucket.com/albums/n523/FarerLychnis/Promotion/raining_zpsb1d6dc90.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""rain""/></p>
<p>Be ready to perform all tactics used in the 'Three Kingdoms' novel!</p>
<p>Trick and ambush your opponents, or take advantage of your terrain to emerge victorious!</p>
<p>Rain, fog, day, night, landslides and floods! Be ready to adjust your play-style as necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>4) Hybrid control system.</h3>

<p>This game have engagement for all.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>5) </strong><strong>Centralized server; find a game anytime, anywhere!</strong></p>

<p>Because of the nature of the game, everyone in the world can play together on one server.</p>
<p>In other words: there are no ping issues! You don't have to choose the server such as US, Europe, Asia and so on...</p>
<p>So you will be able to meet and communicate with players from all around the globe! Also, thanks to that...</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>6) </strong><strong>...socialize! Invite your friend to help win huge battles!</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for you help!</p></div>","Introduction
Hello! I'm an Indie developer from Korea and I need your help to finish my browser game!
'Three Kingdoms Battle' is a turn-based tactics and management game based on the popular Chinese history novel 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms'
Pick your side, rally generals, arm your troops and battle it out against other human opponents while relying on your logistic skills and cunningness to win!
My main focus with this title is to try and create the first pure browser game for E-sports in the world!
I do believe that, with your help, I can provide players with a satisfying game which they can play both casually and on a competitive level.
 
So what's the plan?
In its current state the game is running in open Beta and is accessible to everyone.
To get a general feel what it's about be sure to try playing it online at http://www.threekingdomsbattle.com/
Note: Be sure to turn your speakers on to hear the music!
 
If everything goes smoothly I'm hoping to do the following:

January 2013      – creating better graphics and portraits;
February 2013    – releasing official service;
March 2013        – activate various leagues;
Afterwards...       – game on!
 
What will the money be used for?
Because I'm more of a developer than a designer I can not provide high quality visual elements.
Fund raised here will, first of all, be spent on creating graphics to make for a better user experience.
 
Next come the in-game officer portraits.
During the Chinese “Three Kingdoms” period there were roughly at least 500 different generals!
I would like to, with your help, make sure each and every one of them gets a unique picture showing them in all their might.
So after the basic imagery is updated my next step is to commission artists who'll create these additional portraits.
 Lastly: I do not have enough money to afford to pay for publishing.
In order for this game to reach it's full potential, all leftover cash will be spent on helping it go as far as possible!
You can achieve the perk by contribution.
 Bear in mind that all of your contributions will be spent exclusively for development, graphics and publishing.
I'll be providing regular updates about the game to everyone who contribute whenever I make any progress.
 
 
What are the main features?
 
1) The whole game is HTML5 based!

  
 
This means that you can play the game on your device of choice.
No download necessary. Just open your browser, connect and play!
Your experience will be the same whether you play it on a Tablets or a PC.
I'm also preparing another interface for smart-phones, so stay tuned!
 



 
 
 
 
 
2) Say 'No' to pay2win!
'Three Kingdoms Battle' is aiming to be a game for E-sports.
Much like 'StarCraft' or 'League of Legends', in-balance is of the utmost importance!
This means there won't be any items or anything to always shift the fight in one players favor.
 
 
 
3) Dynamic battle system!

Be ready to perform all tactics used in the 'Three Kingdoms' novel!
Trick and ambush your opponents, or take advantage of your terrain to emerge victorious!
Rain, fog, day, night, landslides and floods! Be ready to adjust your play-style as necessary.
 
 
4) Hybrid control system.

Both players are good at realtime and players aren't good at realtime are ok.
This game have engagement for all.
 
 
 
 
5) Centralized server; find a game anytime, anywhere!

Because of the nature of the game, everyone in the world can play together on one server.
In other words: there are no ping issues! You don't have to choose the server such as US, Europe, Asia and so on...
So you will be able to meet and communicate with players from all around the globe! Also, thanks to that...
 
 
6) ...socialize! Invite your friend to help win huge battles!

 
 

1:N, N:1, 3:5, 4:8, 10:10 and so on...
All is possible !!
 
 
 

Rally huge armies with your companions and take on the enemies in large 20-officer frays!
Keep track of people you've worked with and call on them to help you rule the battlefield! Or...
 
 
 
7) Be a spectator! Broadcast exciting matches!

 
Perhaps you'd rather just watch other player's battle it out? Join in, watch and learn!
If that's not enough: you can also commentate as if you are a broadcaster!
 
 
 
 
What is the development currently at?
Currently there are only two historical maps available:

This is Guan Du. Completed ! 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guan_Du
  

This is red cliffs. Completed ! 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Red_Cliffs
 
Funding will, among the already mentioned, also be used to help make more maps!
Also there is already a good roster of prominent officers available:

<p align=""justify"">Cops and Dragons is a company that specializes on making and designing games. The Core: Time Remains is our first big game, is a 2d action-puzzle platformer based on the history of Otto Brown, an anthropologist and his discovery of the ancient ruins of an unknown civilization. Guided by his ambition, the first level starts when Otto falls into a pit encountering the first enemy.</p>
<p align=""justify""><span>The gameplay is influenced by Metroid and Megaman primarily; one important aspect of the game is that you don’t gather points, what really matters is the time you take to finish each stage, the levels are made for speedruns. Otto will immerse himself into a quest discovering a forgotten world and old demigods living within the core of the planet.</span></p>

<p align=""ltr"">Our mission is to gather enough money to finish the beta version and the first level of the game and all the debts we will engage. We are focusing only on the first level at this point because we need to make the tools to be able to make the whole game and basic expenses. So if we get enough to reach that goal, we can consolidate the initial structure of this project in order to make a serious and professional game.</p>

Cops and Dragons is a company that specializes on making and designing games. The Core: Time Remains is our first big game, is a 2d action-puzzle platformer based on the history of Otto Brown, an anthropologist and his discovery of the ancient ruins of an unknown civilization. Guided by his ambition, the first level starts when Otto falls into a pit encountering the first enemy.
The gameplay is influenced by Metroid and Megaman primarily; one important aspect of the game is that you don’t gather points, what really matters is the time you take to finish each stage, the levels are made for speedruns. Otto will immerse himself into a quest discovering a forgotten world and old demigods living within the core of the planet.

Our mission is to gather enough money to finish the beta version and the first level of the game and all the debts we will engage. We are focusing only on the first level at this point because we need to make the tools to be able to make the whole game and basic expenses. So if we get enough to reach that goal, we can consolidate the initial structure of this project in order to make a serious and professional game.




Nine levels.


Decisions and different paths.


Three weapons, pickaxe, hookshot and slingshot.


Up to eight different powers from different artifacts.


Bosses and minibosses.


Two challenge modes, normal and hardcore.


Interesting enemies.


Fluid and fun gameplay.


Different endings.

Cross-Platform Windows and Mac.

<p> If you've ever played a role playing game, maybe you have had the opportunity to live an adventure in one of the best atmospheres of all times, the background created by H.P. Lovecr</p>
<p>aft with the Chtulhu Mythos.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lovecraft was an author of horror, fantasy and science fiction, especially the subgenre known as weird fiction. Lovecraft's guiding aesthetic and philosophical principle was what he termed ""cosmicism"" or ""cosmic horror"" where the life is incomprehensible to human minds and that the universe is fundamentally inimical to the interests of humankind.</p>
<p>His stories, worthy of any noir novel, his beasts and creatures forged by the more alien and visceral terror to which humanity has had the misfortune to confront, are the highlight of what you can find in the role playing games that reflect his magnificient work.</p>
<p>From the legendary game of percentages to the versatile D20 system, different regulations have attempted to capture the terror that poured, time and time again, from the pen of Lovecraft and so many other artists who followed him.</p>

<p>After examining all the material published so far, we find expansions and modules, some of great quality as the 'Orient Express' or the mythical 'Masks of Nyarlathotep' among others. But we also find many pure filler material with little to none interest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So we, as hardened players, want to help with our little bit to this wonderful world of horror literature.</p>
<p> <img alt=""goal"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://heissenberggs.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/thegoal01.jpg?w=900"" src="""" style="""" title=""goal""/></p>
<h2 align=""center""><strong>""The Thing on the Doorstep""</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>What would happen if there were an organization, a society that took charge of investigating the Myths providing a headquarters and able members, experts in occult, history and with all the information that the narrator and the players need for involving directly new characters? The characters would be aware of the world in which they live and would have the confidence of the rest of the group, because they belong to the same society. The result would be a Player Character ready for action, that only has to be informed of what has happened so far.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What are the benefits of having a research society?. The game becomes more dynamic, entertaining, and avoids having to introduce new characters who may have died or lost their sanity prematurely. The Society itself is an inexhaustible source of literary devices that enrich the game, where the narrator can also provide elements and privileged information to the players right in the beginning or throughout the game, helping them even if they get stuck without knowing what to do at some point in the plot.  It also allows the narrator not only to use Non Player Characters that are relevant or have been members of society, but to also provide you, within the campaigns, of unique antagonists, occult societies, sectarian witches and all manner of creatures of the Mythos.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In summary, here we present a setting's tool for the Narrator. A paranormal investigation society with detailed information about their offices around the globe, as well as the relevant assets and the characters that you can use to further enrich your modules.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We need your valuable contribution to make this project possible and for a potential continuation of this work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you deposit your trust in us, we plan to make a second part. We want to extend the shadows of terror until the fall of the 20th century. We want to walk between years of war, spies and the birth of computers and digital comunications and what all of it supposed for the Myths. It all depends, obviously, on the success of this first part.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is normal to have doubts about the project. You can contact us at <em>vheissenberg@gmail.com</em> and we will answer you to every questions. We look forward to any questions or comments you'd want to send us. We want a product that belong to everyone, that can contribute to its development in the shape that he would, providing any ideas or help to make this book a great reference.</p>

<p>What would we do if we overcome the initial objectives of the project?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, our goal is to make our dream come true making an easy and comprehensive handbook to facilitate the work of making an adventure in the Lovecraft's worlds. It's just that. But if we get enough, we will extend the story by adding new elements to walk over the time and the shadows. We dont want to be left in the basic manual, we want to extend the history of the Society beyond the 20s. Our proposals are:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The aforementioned plus an extension of the manual describing the Heissenberg Society in World War II. The Nazis intended to use magic to control an unimaginable power. In their sheer folly, they recruited experts occultists of similar ideology with the intention not only to win the war, but to rule later with the help of the yoke of alien horror. New weapons, more monsters, antagonists and allies in a setting that mixes the classic horror background with an atmosphere of battles, politicians, spies, soldiers and dozens of hidden secrets to discover.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An additional adventure: Between 1914 and 1918 there were 5 planetary conjunctions, each of which leading to catastrophic consequences that caused the suffering of many but whose news were hidden thanks to contacts and money. They were just the preamble of the conjunction that now, in 1921, will happen, concluding the cycle and provoking the advent of  ""The Expected"". A sect with multiple branches, a leader, many individuals involved and a complex plot in which mankind faces a danger that can only be avoided solving an enigma of such complexity that it will need the most experienced researchers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is obvious that these extensions will only begin if we get enough funds. Making a book, even a small one, requires an enormous effort on the part of many professionals who dedicate their time, effort, knowledge and experience so that the objective is completed properly. We do not intend to do something simple, with the idea of an early completion. We want to create a good manual to be a reference and that would be made so that it looks like a good tool for roleplaying games themed in the worlds of Myths created by Lovecraft.</p>

Heater and scales are the most important elements of crafting part because you need to scale the materials to calculate the mixing ratio and you need to heat these material in certain degree for some time if it is necessary.

My name is James Burton, known as Burtannia, I am passionate about gaming and eSports. My goal is to bring down the barrier between casual and competitive gaming by making an organisation that accepts both. The name ConVoke means to assemble/summon which reflects our vision of bring gamers of all kinds together. As the organisation grows we hope to build successful competitive teams in multiple games and also large casual gaming clans along with a user friendly website to enhance your gaming experience.
   Where Your Money Goes:
eSports organisations and gaming communities only exist because of the support that you guys give, this organisation is no different! Without your financial support this project won't happen.

Countless hours have already been spent planning and designing. I have carefully selected some of the best designers to do our branding and website but they come at a price.
Then there is the running and upkeep of the website.    What's Different About ConVoke Gaming? The following are some of the goals that we hope will make us stand out, some of which we have yet to see done in gaming:  Competitive and Casual clans will bring in all types of gamers. Even if you don't play for us you can still benefit by using our forums to find new team mates or look up tutorials. Create a player ranking system that is dependent upon reviews from your previous team mates making it easier for you to find the level of player you want!    What Are The Risks? Setting up this organisation comes with two major risks:1) We don't raise sufficient funds. 2) People don't join us or use our website.  Hours and hours of planning have gone in to ensure that we will offer something to all sorts of gamers granting us a large target audience. You guys helped create giants like OpTic Gaming just by supporting them whether by watching their videos or buying their merchandise. I have no doubt that with your support we can turn this into something big!    Other Ways You Can Help: If you don't want to help us with money you can still support us by doing any or all of the following:  Subscribe to our YouTube channel and watch our videos (will be uploading as soon as our graphics are done) - We now need 500 Subscribers to get a custom URL! http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHlHYRY9AcmZUzUlFF-9IFw

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Andy Barratt, the creator of My Agility Board which is a website that gives a free online agile board to put your sticky notes onto.  You can sign up to My Agility Board for free in seconds at <a href=""http://www.myagilityboard.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.myagilityboard.com</a></p>
<p>I created My Agility Board to help me keep organised during my honours project at Dundee University where I was studying Applied Computing.  I have since graduated and am now working as a junior developer in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
<p>My fiance and I are keen on keeping My Agility Board secure and reliable however, at the moment, that's not something we can do completely.  The website is hosted on something called virtual hosting which means that it's on a server along side potentially hundreds of other people's websites which can slow it down and sometimes cause it to go down for several minutes.</p>
<p>We're also wanting to buy an SSL certificate that will prove that we've been verified as something people can trust as well as make sure that your data is transmitted across the internet in a secure way so that it can't be caught by a man in the middle trying to hack your private data.</p>
<p>With your contributions, you will allow us to make the site secure and reliable for two years, during which time we're hoping to start making money on the site by offering ""pro"" accounts that will allow users to do more with their boards, for instance, add more boards and add extra information to notes, something that will be useful for professionals using it as well as those who just like to keep things organised.</p>
<p>We really hope you can help, in exchange for a contribution of more than $1, you will automatically make sure you will get any paid for features free of charge, for life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Verisign SSL Certificate for 2 years will cost $630.86</li>
<li>A Memset VM1000 Server for 2 years will cost $453.14</li>
<li>Each T-Shirt including postage will cost $24.03
<ul>
<li>There's a potential that we will need to send out around 40 shirts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IndieGoGo charges a 4% fee then $25 to wire it internationally</li>
</ul>
<p>So in total we're needing to raise $2,155.42</p>
<p>To see an example board with these details on it go to <a href=""http://www.myagilityboard.com/funding"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.myagilityboard.com/funding</a></p>
<p>In exchange we're planning to give T-Shirts for contributions of $50 or over.  These T-Shirts will have the phrase, ""I used agility, it's super effective!"" embroidered on them.  More details about perks can be found on this page.</p>
<p>We're going for the all or nothing funding method here so if we don't raise all the funds here, we'll not actually get any money and your pledge will be refunded.  We just feel it would be a bit dishonest to take your money if we can't actually carry out the project.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping out, you'll be helping us actually do something wonderful with this site and make it so much more useful to users as it will be much more reliable so it's there when people need it, as they need it.  Some of our users have already told us that they put some secure/private data on their boards so your help will also make sure that no one can catch what they are sending to the site by sniffing their networks.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It doesn't matter if you can't contribute but sharing this page and letting others know about My Agility Board will really help and of course, we'd love it if you sign up to My Agility Board and use it and tell me how you're using it.  People's feedback really helps us improve the site and it's free to use so the more people using it, the more feedback we can get.  So please, even if you can't help with money, just using the site and sharing it and sharing this campaign is actually contributing in a massive way and of course, we will love you forever :)</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">During the golden era of Toonville, Fleish the Fox is the star of all the shorts recorded in this black and white cartoon world. His arch-nemesis, Mr Mintz, always tries to ruin his adventures by capturing his girlfriend Cherry, but despite his evil machinations, Fleish continuously manages to get his happy ending with her. But things are going to take an unexpected turn…</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Fleish &amp; Cherry in Crazy Hotel </em>is a game set in the 30s, the sunset of the black and white era. The visual elements, the sound and especially the gameplay itself, will make the player feel like being another toon. But before we delve into “Crazy Hotel”, let us check in at the reception to explain the features of the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hybrid between <strong>graphic adventure</strong> and <strong>action adventure</strong> in perfect balance with different <strong>environmental puzzles</strong> spread in the game’s <strong>5 chapters</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Single-player</strong> adventure in <strong>black &amp; white 2D visuals</strong>, adopting an <strong>isometric view.</strong>
</li>
<li>A <strong>story</strong> with a fun and rich <strong>dialogue system</strong>, multiple characters and objects with which you'll have to <strong>interact</strong> to achieve your goals, and use <strong>incredible skills</strong> typical of cartoons.</li>
<li>Developed with the <strong>Unity</strong> engine for PC, Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>Initially, the game will be available in <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Spanish.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""dispositivos"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://redlittlehousestudios.com/images/los-3-dispositivos.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><strong><img alt=""Cabecera-02"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://redlittlehousestudios.com/images/Cabecera-2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Several elements of known past games have inspired us in the development of “Fleish &amp; Cherry in Crazy Hotel”.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is the recipe followed by the chefs from “Crazy Hotel”:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Combining the isometric view of <strong>Little Big Adventure</strong> with the puzzle's style of <strong>Zelda </strong>.</p>
<p>We mix it with the humor, the dialogue selection system and the type of interaction with characters and objects of graphic adventures like <strong>Monkey Island</strong>, <strong>Day of the Tentacle</strong> and <strong>Grim Fandango</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Those dialogues are presented through a visual touch akin to <strong>Professor Layton</strong> and <strong>Phoenix Wright.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Cabecera-03"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://redlittlehousestudios.com/images/Cabecera-3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Being a toon is not as easy as people ""paint it"".</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Throughout the story, the player will have to tie up the information obtained on the world, its objects and characters. He must find the right combination of items and abilities to use depending on the situations that arise. You won’t only be transported to this cartoon universe, but you will also have to act and think like a toon in order to progress in the game.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is what the room service has prepared for your stay in our title:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Black and white</strong> game, with the characteristic style of the animated shorts of the 30's.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ingenious environmental puzzles</strong> that you'll have to solve using different <strong>objects</strong>, <strong>skills of the cartoons </strong>and, above all, thinking like a cartoon.</li>
<li>A <strong>story</strong> with a plot that will absorb you from start to finish, filled with surprising and unexpected side stories.</li>
<li>
<strong>Plot twist </strong>of ""The Damsel in distress"" to ""Dude in Distress"".</li>
<li>Different <strong>enemies</strong> that you will have to defeat by using your cunning and by solving the puzzles that will appear.</li>
<li>Even if the action occurs in a hotel, as it’s a <strong>cartoon building </strong>each one of the floors is a complete <strong>different world full of surprises</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Frame by frame animation</strong> of characters, objects, intro and the different cut scenes in the vein of classic animation style.</li>
<li>The game will be full of <strong>details</strong> and <strong>tributes</strong> to the history of animation and to the great artists of the time like Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks, Max Fleischer or Friz Freleng.</li>
<li>
<strong>EXTRA</strong>! The player can find <strong>collectable posters</strong> to delve deeper in the game’s universe.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ready, set... action!! Fleish begins his new short film walking around Toonville when he meets his lovely girlfriend Cherry. The romantic moment is interrupted when the villain Mr. Mintz enters the scene and, on the contrary to what we were accustomed, captures Fleish and takes him to the top of a hotel under construction. This time, it is Cherry’s turn to muster her courage and overcome the craziness awaiting her on the multiple floors of the building and rescue her beloved Fleish. Are you ready to accompany Cherry on her adventure?</p>
<h3><strong>Characters</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A variety of animated characters with different stories that you will discover throughout the game are waiting in the Hotel Hyperion. Let's meet the main cast:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><img alt=""Faces"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://redlittlehousestudios.com/images/los-3-faces.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong> </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Cherry</strong>. Sweet, fun and positive, this is the way we could define Cherry, the protagonist of the game and the one the player will control. Our regular damsel in distress in all her past adventures with Fleish, will now have to rescue her love from the clutches of the evil Mr Mintz, and discover what is her true role in Toonville’s universe.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Fleish. </strong>This attentive and generous fox, always looking for a fun solution to help others, is the main star of the short films directed in Toonville. He will be kidnapped by his enemy Mr. Mintz and his only hope rests upon his love, Cherry.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Mr. Mintz. </strong>The villain of the game, and Fleish’s antagonist. His selfish and manipulative nature makes him the evil figure of Toonville. Tired and sick of Fleish’s fame, he decides to capture him to record his own short films in which he will be the only protagonist.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Ninette and Doc Goose"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://redlittlehousestudios.com/images/Ninette%20y%20Doc%20Goose.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Ninette: </strong>She’s Cherry’s best friend and a journalist in the newspaper “Daily Looney”. She is a hard-worker but her impulsive and restless personality has caused her some problems. Her big addiction to work <span>has made her negletct her relationship with Doc Goose</span>. She moves to the Hyperion Hotel to write an article about Fleish and while she is doing research about it, she will discover a hidden mystery in Toonville.</p>
<p><strong>Doc Goose: </strong>He was a promising <span>scientist</span> whose <span>career</span> was truncated because of the disastrous effects of his inventions. His extremely clumsiness and forgetfulness have earned him the reputation of “Nutty Scientist” in Toonville. <span>He loves Ninette like in the first day</span> and he protects her with his secret identity from the troubles in which she gets into. Because he’s not our hero. He’s a silent…and clumsy guardian, a watchful protector…</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with your monitor... Do not attempt to adjust the picture... Fleish &amp; Cherry comes in full Black &amp; White!</p>
<p>The visual aspect is one of the most important parts of the game, because everything has to be anchored to the 30s and respond to the laws of the cartoon’s world. We have traveled back in time and lived with Mickey Mouse, Oswald, the Looney Toones, Betty Boop and Popeye, among others, to inspire us and to get our own style.</p>

That’s why the soundtrack of Hankins Studio is the best companion of the Fleish &amp; Cherry adventures.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Alejandro Ribes Hankins and Carlos Vera Tamarit, members of this recording studio specializing in sound design and music production, will be responsible to liven up the party in the hotel. The type of music, from ragtime to Big Band, and the sound effects made in Toonville, will be very reminiscent of that period and every character and level of the game will have its own style. </p>

During the golden era of Toonville, Fleish the Fox is the star of all the shorts recorded in this black and white cartoon world. His arch-nemesis, Mr Mintz, always tries to ruin his adventures by capturing his girlfriend Cherry, but despite his evil machinations, Fleish continuously manages to get his happy ending with her. But things are going to take an unexpected turn…
Fleish & Cherry in Crazy Hotel is a game set in the 30s, the sunset of the black and white era. The visual elements, the sound and especially the gameplay itself, will make the player feel like being another toon. But before we delve into “Crazy Hotel”, let us check in at the reception to explain the features of the game:

Hybrid between graphic adventure and action adventure in perfect balance with different environmental puzzles spread in the game’s 5 chapters.

Single-player adventure in black & white 2D visuals, adopting an isometric view.

A story with a fun and rich dialogue system, multiple characters and objects with which you'll have to interact to achieve your goals, and use incredible skills typical of cartoons.
Developed with the Unity engine for PC, Mac and Linux.
Initially, the game will be available in English and Spanish.




Several elements of known past games have inspired us in the development of “Fleish & Cherry in Crazy Hotel”.
This is the recipe followed by the chefs from “Crazy Hotel”:
Combining the isometric view of Little Big Adventure with the puzzle's style of Zelda .
We mix it with the humor, the dialogue selection system and the type of interaction with characters and objects of graphic adventures like Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle and Grim Fandango.
Those dialogues are presented through a visual touch akin to Professor Layton and Phoenix Wright.
 

Being a toon is not as easy as people ""paint it"".
Throughout the story, the player will have to tie up the information obtained on the world, its objects and characters. He must find the right combination of items and abilities to use depending on the situations that arise. You won’t only be transported to this cartoon universe, but you will also have to act and think like a toon in order to progress in the game.
This is what the room service has prepared for your stay in our title:


Black and white game, with the characteristic style of the animated shorts of the 30's.

Ingenious environmental puzzles that you'll have to solve using different objects, skills of the cartoons and, above all, thinking like a cartoon.
A story with a plot that will absorb you from start to finish, filled with surprising and unexpected side stories.

Plot twist of ""The Damsel in distress"" to ""Dude in Distress"".
Different enemies that you will have to defeat by using your cunning and by solving the puzzles that will appear.
Even if the action occurs in a hotel, as it’s a cartoon building each one of the floors is a complete different world full of surprises.

Frame by frame animation of characters, objects, intro and the different cut scenes in the vein of classic animation style.
The game will be full of details and tributes to the history of animation and to the great artists of the time like Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks, Max Fleischer or Friz Freleng.

EXTRA! The player can find collectable posters to delve deeper in the game’s universe.

 


 


Ready, set... action!! Fleish begins his new short film walking around Toonville when he meets his lovely girlfriend Cherry. The romantic moment is interrupted when the villain Mr. Mintz enters the scene and, on the contrary to what we were accustomed, captures Fleish and takes him to the top of a hotel under construction. This time, it is Cherry’s turn to muster her courage and overcome the craziness awaiting her on the multiple floors of the building and rescue her beloved Fleish. Are you ready to accompany Cherry on her adventure?
Characters
A variety of animated characters with different stories that you will discover throughout the game are waiting in the Hotel Hyperion. Let's meet the main cast:

 
Cherry. Sweet, fun and positive, this is the way we could define Cherry, the protagonist of the game and the one the player will control. Our regular damsel in distress in all her past adventures with Fleish, will now have to rescue her love from the clutches of the evil Mr Mintz, and discover what is her true role in Toonville’s universe.
Fleish. This attentive and generous fox, always looking for a fun solution to help others, is the main star of the short films directed in Toonville. He will be kidnapped by his enemy Mr. Mintz and his only hope rests upon his love, Cherry.
Mr. Mintz. The villain of the game, and Fleish’s antagonist. His selfish and manipulative nature makes him the evil figure of Toonville. Tired and sick of Fleish’s fame, he decides to capture him to record his own short films in which he will be the only protagonist.
 
Ninette: She’s Cherry’s best friend and a journalist in the newspaper “Daily Looney”. She is a hard-worker but her impulsive and restless personality has caused her some problems. Her big addiction to work has made her negletct her relationship with Doc Goose. She moves to the Hyperion Hotel to write an article about Fleish and while she is doing research about it, she will discover a hidden mystery in Toonville.
Doc Goose: He was a promising scientist whose career was truncated because of the disastrous effects of his inventions. His extremely clumsiness and forgetfulness have earned him the reputation of “Nutty Scientist” in Toonville. He loves Ninette like in the first day and he protects her with his secret identity from the troubles in which she gets into. Because he’s not our hero. He’s a silent…and clumsy guardian, a watchful protector…
 
 
 
Behind Fleish & Cherry in Crazy Hotel is Red Little House Studios, a structure gathering a creative team of dedicated artists and developers, committed with their spirit and vision to make an original and entertaining game.

 
Collaborators:
Yoni Dayan: Senior Consultant
Veteran in new technology and gaming, graduated in international affairs and history, Yoni is a consultant, advising us on several subjects and helping us with crowdfunding, publishing on the web and with the French translations. He is a fan of 80s and 90s PC games and innovative software. He tries to be paid in Spanish delicacies.

There is nothing wrong with your monitor... Do not attempt to adjust the picture... Fleish & Cherry comes in full Black & White!
The visual aspect is one of the most important parts of the game, because everything has to be anchored to the 30s and respond to the laws of the cartoon’s world. We have traveled back in time and lived with Mickey Mouse, Oswald, the Looney Toones, Betty Boop and Popeye, among others, to inspire us and to get our own style.
 

 

 

Someone once said that since the advent of sound, music was an additional companion for the cartoons. That’s why the soundtrack of Hankins Studio is the best companion of the Fleish & Cherry adventures.
Alejandro Ribes Hankins and Carlos Vera Tamarit, members of this recording studio specializing in sound design and music production, will be responsible to liven up the party in the hotel. The type of music, from ragtime to Big Band, and the sound effects made in Toonville, will be very reminiscent of that period and every character and level of the game will have its own style.

<h2><img alt=""Welcome Miner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/h2_welcome_miner.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Welcome Miner""/></h2>
<p>The old earth is doomed to extinction and the people start to colonize a new earth. In order to prevent repeated environmental disasters and overexploitation, the new world has been put under strict protection. The exploitation of natural resources is now done by robots in faraway systems. Former transport ships have been converted to cargo ships whose operations are monitored by only one human commander. The exploiting corporations go to any length to protect their domination and are not afraid to use battleships.</p>
<p>In Galactic Mining Corp you are responsible for the tactical management of your corporation and in real-time battles you are fighting against other players to protect your interests. You expand your resource production, extent your fleet, configure your ships, build mine exploitation stations or defense systems and you fight for natural resources.</p>
<h2><img alt=""Core Elements"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/h2_core_elements.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Core Elements""/></h2>
<p>Galactic Mining Corp (GMC) is a real-time strategy and simulation game that offers many gameplay options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Different ways of playing as miner, merchant, protector or pirate</strong><br/>(can be switched during the game)</li>
<li><strong>Construct individual battleships</strong></li>
<li><strong>Attack and defense, alone or together as a team</strong></li>
<li><strong>Secure planets and exploitation stations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Raw material mining and trade</strong></li>
<li><strong>Research and expansion</strong></li>
<li><strong>Train your commanders</strong></li>
<li><strong>Diplomacy: form alliances or wage war</strong></li>
</ul><h2><img alt=""Universe"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/h2_universe.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Universe""/></h2>
<p>The universe consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Galaxies</li>
<li>Systems</li>
<li>Side Systems</li>
<li>Planets</li>
<li>Asteroids</li>
<li>Anomalies</li>
<li>any many more explorable objects</li>
</ul><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/universe.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""""/></p>
<h3>Galaxy</h3>
<p>Every galaxy consists of 10 to 20 systems.</p>
<p>The fleets can travel between galaxies by use of jump drive. But the jump drive is inaccurate causing the fleet to reappear in a random system entering another galaxy.</p>
<h3>Systems</h3>
<p>Every system contains 1 to 5 colonizable planets as well as raw material asteroids.</p>
<p>The systems of a galaxy are interconnected by hyperspace corridors which provide secure travel between target systems.</p>
<h3>Side Systems</h3>
<p>The side systems contain raw material asteroids, unexplored anomalies and missions.</p>
<p>They can only be accessed through a hyperspace corridor of the main system.</p>
<h3>Planets</h3>
<p>The colonizable planets of a system yield only few resources and are protected by an intergalactic agreement against overexploitation. Only resource storage and processing is possible on them.</p>
<h3>Asteroids</h3>
<p>Asteroids contain extractable raw materials which are required to build ships and structures as well as for further research.</p>
<h2><img alt=""4X Gameplay"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/h2_4x_gameplay.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""4X Gameplay""/></h2>
<p>The player owns a home planet; from there the player can explore systems, build ships and structures and advance technologies.</p>
<h3><img alt=""Explore"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/4x_explore.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Explore""/></h3>
<p>The own planet yields only small quantities of raw materials, therefore the player has to scout the surroundings and nearby systems with a scout vessel searching for available asteroids.</p>
<h3><img alt=""Expand"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/4x_expand.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Expand""/></h3>
<p>With mine ships, which have been manufactured only for this purpose, the player establishes exploitation stations on asteroids. After that, a free transporter starts to carry the raw materials back to the home world.</p>
<h3><img alt=""Exploit"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/4x_exploit.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Exploit""/></h3>
<p>The acquired raw materials are used to upgrade the planet, the asteroids, the fleets or for further research.</p>
<h3><img alt=""Exterminate"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/4x_exterminate.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Exterminate""/></h3>
<p>The player combats rival fleets, loots transporters, asteroids or whole planets.</p>
<p>Alone or in player alliances huge battles can be conducted.</p>
<h2><img alt=""Battleships"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/h2_battleships.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Battleships""/></h2>
<p>Every ship can be equipped according to your own requirements with weapons and protection systems. Therefore every ship has equippable <strong>module slots</strong>.</p>
<p>In total 15 different ships are available, providing endless combination possibilities with their individually equippable modules.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/battleship_modules.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""""/></p>
<h3>Module Types</h3>
<p>There are 4 module types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Attack Modules</strong><br/>These slots are available for weapons.</li>
<li>
<strong>Defense Modules</strong><br/>Contain defense modules like shields or armor.</li>
<li>
<strong>Support Modules</strong><br/>Support attack/defense modules or provide further abilities like tractor beams.</li>
<li>
<strong>User-defined Modules</strong><br/>These modules have to be explored for each ship and can be defined as attack, defense or support module.</li>
</ul><h3>5 Ship Categories</h3>
<p>Ships are divided up to different sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corvettes</li>
<li>Frigates</li>
<li>Destroyers</li>
<li>Cruisers</li>
<li>Battleships</li>
</ul><p>The size determines the amount of available modules and the basic values for attack, defense or speed.</p>
<h3>3 Ship Orientations</h3>
<p>Every ship category provides 3 different module configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attack</li>
<li>Defense</li>
<li>Support</li>
</ul><p>Ships with attack configuration offer for example more weapon modules but less protection.</p>
<h2><img alt=""Civil Ships"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/h2_civil_ships.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Civil Ships""/></h2>
<p>Raw material mining, transport and supply are done with civilian ships.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Transporter</strong><br/>Transports exploited raw materials back to the home world or to a merchant.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mine Ship / Exploitation Station</strong><br/>Establishes a base on asteroids and produces raw materials.</li>
<li>
<strong>Settlement Ship</strong><br/>Explores and colonizes new worlds.</li>
</ul><h2><img alt=""Commander"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/h2_commander.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Commander""/></h2>
<p>Every ship (battleships and civilian ships) has its own commander who collects experience points completing tasks, missions and battles. These points can be invested in his skills.</p>
<p>The training and the commander’s development can be the crucial factor during space battles or for protecting your resources against pirate attacks.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/commander.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""""/></p>
<h2><img alt=""Structures"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/h2_structures.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Structures""/></h2>
<p>The home world as well as its orbit and an asteroid’s orbit can be upgraded with structures:</p>
<ul>
<li>defense systems</li>
<li>resource storing</li>
<li>shipyards</li>
<li>commercial center</li>
<li>surveillance satellites</li>
<li>jamming transmitters</li>
<li>jump distortion</li>
</ul><h2><img alt=""Way of gaming"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/h2_way_of_gaming.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Way of gaming""/></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Miner</strong><br/>Expand your influence through raw material mining and explore new regions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Merchant</strong><br/>Be responsible for exchange and commerce of resources and gain supremacy through economic expertise.</li>
<li>
<strong>Protector</strong><br/>Protect miners and merchants from pirate attacks. You advance by using diplomacy and combat.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pirate</strong><br/>Life as a miner is not enough for you, or are you simply evil? Then you can cause fear and terror as a pirate.</li>
</ul><p>The basic gameplay is the same for every disposition; small differences are in details like raw material mining or ship’s speed.</p>
<p>Major differences are for example in protection contracts (for protectors) or the looting of raw material transporters (for pirates).</p>
<p>The gameplay choice can be changed after some playtime, this way a miner can become a pirate and vice versa.</p>
<h3>Galactic Insurance</h3>
<p>In space battles a player may quickly lose his fleet; therefore a galactic insurance exists, so that the flow of playing is not disturbed and all the development has not been in vain.</p>
<p>This insurance automatically replaces all ships and structures after a certain amount of time, so the player does not lose his progress.</p>
<p>In order to accelerate the restoration of a player’s structures and fleets, exploited raw materials can be invested.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>In every game you find hardcore players and casual players. The casual player would be frustrated rather quickly, if he or she lost all the acquired progress through big players.</p>
<p>Therefore the casual player is encouraged to form alliances or to seek security from protectors.</p>
<p>The fun factor is supposed to remain; big players are rewarded through obtained raw materials as well as experience points.</p>
<h2><img alt=""Rewards"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gmcgame.com/img/crowdfunding/indiegogo/h2_rewards.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Rewards""/></h2>

<p>Whaaaaat, crowdfunding and that for a browser game with subscription model?</p>
<p>No, we are not crazy ! ;-)</p>
<p>The game needs a certain pre-financing so that we can finish it competently within the estimated 4 - 6 month (including beta phase).</p>
<p>We deliberately decided to include a subscription model because we want to deliver a satisfying game without unfair advantages for a small group of paying players.</p>
<p>Further we want to guarantee a good server infrastructure in addition to reliable support for future game maintenance.</p>

The old earth is doomed to extinction and the people start to colonize a new earth. In order to prevent repeated environmental disasters and overexploitation, the new world has been put under strict protection. The exploitation of natural resources is now done by robots in faraway systems. Former transport ships have been converted to cargo ships whose operations are monitored by only one human commander. The exploiting corporations go to any length to protect their domination and are not afraid to use battleships.
In Galactic Mining Corp you are responsible for the tactical management of your corporation and in real-time battles you are fighting against other players to protect your interests. You expand your resource production, extent your fleet, configure your ships, build mine exploitation stations or defense systems and you fight for natural resources.

Galactic Mining Corp (GMC) is a real-time strategy and simulation game that offers many gameplay options:


Different ways of playing as miner, merchant, protector or pirate(can be switched during the game)
Construct individual battleships
Attack and defense, alone or together as a team
Secure planets and exploitation stations
Raw material mining and trade
Research and expansion
Train your commanders
Diplomacy: form alliances or wage war

The universe consists of:

Galaxies
Systems
Side Systems
Planets
Asteroids
Anomalies
any many more explorable objects

Galaxy
Every galaxy consists of 10 to 20 systems.
The fleets can travel between galaxies by use of jump drive. But the jump drive is inaccurate causing the fleet to reappear in a random system entering another galaxy.
Systems
Every system contains 1 to 5 colonizable planets as well as raw material asteroids.
The systems of a galaxy are interconnected by hyperspace corridors which provide secure travel between target systems.
Side Systems
The side systems contain raw material asteroids, unexplored anomalies and missions.
They can only be accessed through a hyperspace corridor of the main system.
Planets
The colonizable planets of a system yield only few resources and are protected by an intergalactic agreement against overexploitation. Only resource storage and processing is possible on them.
Asteroids
Asteroids contain extractable raw materials which are required to build ships and structures as well as for further research.

The player owns a home planet; from there the player can explore systems, build ships and structures and advance technologies.

The own planet yields only small quantities of raw materials, therefore the player has to scout the surroundings and nearby systems with a scout vessel searching for available asteroids.

With mine ships, which have been manufactured only for this purpose, the player establishes exploitation stations on asteroids. After that, a free transporter starts to carry the raw materials back to the home world.

The acquired raw materials are used to upgrade the planet, the asteroids, the fleets or for further research.

The player combats rival fleets, loots transporters, asteroids or whole planets.
Alone or in player alliances huge battles can be conducted.

Every ship can be equipped according to your own requirements with weapons and protection systems. Therefore every ship has equippable module slots.
In total 15 different ships are available, providing endless combination possibilities with their individually equippable modules.

Module Types
There are 4 module types:


Attack ModulesThese slots are available for weapons.

Defense ModulesContain defense modules like shields or armor.

Support ModulesSupport attack/defense modules or provide further abilities like tractor beams.

User-defined ModulesThese modules have to be explored for each ship and can be defined as attack, defense or support module.
5 Ship Categories
Ships are divided up to different sizes:

Corvettes
Frigates
Destroyers
Cruisers
Battleships
The size determines the amount of available modules and the basic values for attack, defense or speed.
3 Ship Orientations
Every ship category provides 3 different module configurations:

Attack
Defense
Support
Ships with attack configuration offer for example more weapon modules but less protection.

Raw material mining, transport and supply are done with civilian ships.


TransporterTransports exploited raw materials back to the home world or to a merchant.

Mine Ship / Exploitation StationEstablishes a base on asteroids and produces raw materials.

Settlement ShipExplores and colonizes new worlds.

Every ship (battleships and civilian ships) has its own commander who collects experience points completing tasks, missions and battles. These points can be invested in his skills.
The training and the commander’s development can be the crucial factor during space battles or for protecting your resources against pirate attacks.


The home world as well as its orbit and an asteroid’s orbit can be upgraded with structures:

defense systems
resource storing
shipyards
commercial center
surveillance satellites
jamming transmitters
jump distortion



MinerExpand your influence through raw material mining and explore new regions.

MerchantBe responsible for exchange and commerce of resources and gain supremacy through economic expertise.

ProtectorProtect miners and merchants from pirate attacks. You advance by using diplomacy and combat.

PirateLife as a miner is not enough for you, or are you simply evil? Then you can cause fear and terror as a pirate.
The basic gameplay is the same for every disposition; small differences are in details like raw material mining or ship’s speed.
Major differences are for example in protection contracts (for protectors) or the looting of raw material transporters (for pirates).
The gameplay choice can be changed after some playtime, this way a miner can become a pirate and vice versa.
Galactic Insurance
In space battles a player may quickly lose his fleet; therefore a galactic insurance exists, so that the flow of playing is not disturbed and all the development has not been in vain.
This insurance automatically replaces all ships and structures after a certain amount of time, so the player does not lose his progress.
In order to accelerate the restoration of a player’s structures and fleets, exploited raw materials can be invested.
Why?
In every game you find hardcore players and casual players. The casual player would be frustrated rather quickly, if he or she lost all the acquired progress through big players.
Therefore the casual player is encouraged to form alliances or to seek security from protectors.
The fun factor is supposed to remain; big players are rewarded through obtained raw materials as well as experience points.

200 € Commander-EditionYour picture is immortalized within the game. A picture for a ship commander, especially adjusted for the game, will be visible for everyone.Unlimited in time access to the game and of course all rewards mentioned before.

8.000 €
GMC will be a lot of development work for us and we hope for your support.
We are two web developers and we estimate a timescale between 4 - 6 month (including beta phase) for completion.
During this time the main game features will be realized:

building ships
combat
research
colonization
commerce
missions (also for multiple players)
ranking lists
multilingualism: German / English

Whaaaaat, crowdfunding and that for a browser game with subscription model?
No, we are not crazy ! ;-)
The game needs a certain pre-financing so that we can finish it competently within the estimated 4 - 6 month (including beta phase).
We deliberately decided to include a subscription model because we want to deliver a satisfying game without unfair advantages for a small group of paying players.
Further we want to guarantee a good server infrastructure in addition to reliable support for future game maintenance.

System Requirements

<p>Renewal is a zombie survival, turn-based combat game based in a virtual world. It is currently in it's first beta version which is fortunately free to play. This game has been in development for over a year now, with myself as the sole developer of the game. There are many features in this game that are common to several other RPG games such as a quest system, inventory system, and NPC system. There are also a few features that await being implimented into the game such as buildings, and saving NPCs from the World Beyond (zombie territory).</p>
<p align=""CENTER""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Story</strong></span></p>
<p>Hey guys, my name is Tom and I am the sole developer of Renewal. I have spent literally hundreds of hours developing this game since March 2012 (might even surpass 1000 hrs) and have come across so many issues during this time. Some problems that arose took me several days, and although I felt so urged to give up I pushed myself to continue because I wanted to make it a success. Doing many different aspects myself I found it a very stressful situation, but many times I was able to actually have some fun with it. In the recent months I began to add sound effects into the game, and this has been one of the most entertaining parts of development I must say (next to seeing the way the game is progressing). After looking for good sources online with free sound effects I came to the conclusion that it would be better and more consistent if I just made my own sound effects. So I downloaded a sound recording program and started doing crazy things to make sound effects that work. This took a lot of brainstorming and actually turned out satisfying for me. So anyways I am truly hoping that this campaign is going to make those insane hours spent on the game worth the time. I am trying my best to make Renewal the kind of game that anybody could enjoy playing!</p>

<p>[Unlike many other campaigns Renewal is not only going to show you screenshots of the gameplay, you can actually try the current version of the game for yourself to really see its potential! If you are interested in trying it out before purchasing it, feel free to contact me at RenewalTheGame_Support@hotmail.com.

<p>Being a gamer has its perks when it comes to developng a game. I commonly find myself looking at comments on games and thinking to myself...""Wow I really agree with that"". So I am confident to say I look for the same thing in a game as many of you probably do.

<p>Level 5: Choose any name you want an NPC to be given (legit name) as long as it is agreeable... (Not something ridiculous like, whale).</p>
<p>Level 6: Choose any name you want to give an NPC, then send me pictures of yourself/what you want the NPC to look like. Time will be put in from me as well as improvements from other pixel artists to make the NPC look like you/the picture(s).</p>
<p>Level 7: Special title given on credits must be something reasonable (can't be something like ""Developer"", or ""Marketer"")</p>
<p>Level 8: Name to be put on main menu must also be a legit thing, no ridiculous names for this either. I would prefer a real name, but username would work as well. IM/Skype time, your decision, I will answer any questions you may have about the games development and where we plan to go with it. I am also willing to spend some time with casual conversation! Depending on time on hand may have several different sessions over time, deal can be made!</p>
<p>*Note: All perks above Level 4 include a 4 pack of the game*</p>
<p>*Also if the campaign is a success any supporters Level 1+ Will be receiving free beta releases, as the game will become closed beta, only accesible by pre-order*</p>
<p>*Video states $30.00 will get you an NPC modeled after you, however this perk has changed to $50.00 because of the difficulty with doing so. Please excuse me for the mistake*</p>

<p>Keep in mind this game is not in it's full state and you may notice less content then a full fledged game. Beta V1.0 is focused on the game engine and gameflow of the game not the content amounts.  There is bound to be a lot of content added throughout upcoming releases, as well as new and improved features. This being said, there are some known bugs in V1.0, which have been fixed already. However the known bugs barely effect gameplay and so will be released when V1.1 comes out.</p>
<p>That's all to say about it, have fun, and don't forget to give feedback in the end, it is always highly appreciated!</p>

Funding (Where the money is going)
I started this campaign to fund for certain aspects of the games development.
[$100.00]To submit the game on steam greenlight
[$150.00]To obtain a professional license to Stencyl. Needed to export (.exe)'s
[$800.00-$900.00]More money is also needed to help pay off for the developing system. While developing the first few months of the game, I had a system that was somewhat suitable to running/testing the game. But after so long the CPU began to be less and less effective to the point where the game would not run smooth on the system. For this reason I needed to buy a more efficient system, and I am hoping the game will be able to fund for this lost money.
[Remaining money] Help fund for publicising the game and potentially some new background music.

I also plan to add tutorials for one of the next releases to make the game easier to play for new players.
 
Perks:
 
There are some things that should be noted with the perks.
 

 
Level 1-4 Perks: Copies of the game refers to Steam codes when/if released on steam. Otherwise personal copies of the game will be distributed! If a multi-pack is purchased, [Level 2+] extra copies are able to be gifted to a friend. Name in credits will be put down as the name you desire.
Level 5: Choose any name you want an NPC to be given (legit name) as long as it is agreeable... (Not something ridiculous like, whale).
Level 6: Choose any name you want to give an NPC, then send me pictures of yourself/what you want the NPC to look like. Time will be put in from me as well as improvements from other pixel artists to make the NPC look like you/the picture(s).
Level 7: Special title given on credits must be something reasonable (can't be something like ""Developer"", or ""Marketer"")
Level 8: Name to be put on main menu must also be a legit thing, no ridiculous names for this either. I would prefer a real name, but username would work as well. IM/Skype time, your decision, I will answer any questions you may have about the games development and where we plan to go with it. I am also willing to spend some time with casual conversation! Depending on time on hand may have several different sessions over time, deal can be made!
*Note: All perks above Level 4 include a 4 pack of the game*
*Also if the campaign is a success any supporters Level 1+ Will be receiving free beta releases, as the game will become closed beta, only accesible by pre-order*
*Video states $30.00 will get you an NPC modeled after you, however this perk has changed to $50.00 because of the difficulty with doing so. Please excuse me for the mistake*
 

Want to help out but can't afford to!?
Help me out with spreading the word! Renewal is an indie project not widely known and it would be greatly appreciated if anyone could help me out with spreading the word. If you agree that this project is worth your time, please take a couple minutes to share this with your friends and family, as well as any gaming communities you are with!
 
Thanks for your time!

NEW!
 
I have finally got around to creating a twitter page! Link can be found below.
 
Multiplayer System:
One thing that hasn't been discussed with my followers very much as to the game is the multiplayer system. Many concepts have been designed for Renewal multiplayer system. This system will begin development as soon as the single player base game has been completed with features... In other words, I will continue developing multiplayer when the single player version only needs new content/items.

Contact me if you have any questions, comments, concerns, or suggestions for the next release, as ideas are always taken into consideration with my own concepts!
Keep in mind this game is not in it's full state and you may notice less content then a full fledged game. Beta V1.0 is focused on the game engine and gameflow of the game not the content amounts.  There is bound to be a lot of content added throughout upcoming releases, as well as new and improved features. This being said, there are some known bugs in V1.0, which have been fixed already. However the known bugs barely effect gameplay and so will be released when V1.1 comes out.
That's all to say about it, have fun, and don't forget to give feedback in the end, it is always highly appreciated!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

INTRODUCTION
There are people who die and people who kill in our world. And now just after leaving the forest I understood that those who kill had come for our souls. I threw the basket away and ran to the village. I didn’t even understand why I was running to the hell. I should have run back into the forest. Screams and clanging were everywhere. I couldn’t do anything. I could only hide, cry and wait till it's all safe. And hope that they won’t find me and I’ll live. I ran. I ran and no one looked at me. As always. There is always so much trouble in the village. I hid in the cellar and all I could do is listen. Listen to the sounds of the real world that was taking from me everything I had. 
Listen unable to do anything. It was the moment something broke inside of me. The demon inside has awaken …  
I was awakened by the buzzing silence. No sound was to be heard and it scared me. At first I thought it all had been just a dream. It was so light and the bright sun was dazzling me. With a throbbing head somehow I got outside. As soon as my eyes adjusted to the sunlight I understood it had been no dream. Everywhere I looked there were smoking remains of my village. Houses, sheds, granaries – everything was destroyed. And not a living soul around. Only horribly mutilated dead bodies. Slowly I walked through the village. I didn’t have the strength to bury the corpses nor to dig up mass graves. I could no longer understand whether it was the silence buzzing in my ears or the sound of a splitting headache. The sun was burning my eyes. I couldn’t look up. I could only look down and ‘enjoy’ the view of my own powerlessness.  
My name is Dakara. And I became the one who kills. 
When she was a child, Dakara felt strange powers inside of her, but she couldn’t understand what was going on. When she was 15, her tribe was attacked. Dakara was witness to the death of her parents and friends. She saw the flows of blood. It was the moment her abilities awoke. The demon inside of her has woken up.

</div></div>","ABOUT US                
 
Another World Miniatures is our dream to create a miniature line for collectors and gamers: for now only scale 1:61  (minis could vary between 30mm and 32mm).
Ideals for GdR, but also great additions to an existing army or simply collectible high quality miniatures.

This is a project just launched, and we already have
available some great sculptures that are
highly detailed and characterful.

These miniatures come unpainted and we cast them in
two ways:




Resin highest quality limited numbered edition for collectors (80 ex)

Metal high quality unlimited edition

We guarantee the quality of sculptures and the quality of casting.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>FAQ</b></h2>
<p><b>Does it
come in different sizes? <br/></b><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>  No. We analyzed
and researched extensive amount of data to ensure the NEST mouse is designed to
fit most of users. </span></p>
<p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'><br/></span></p>
<p><b>When will
new colors/versions be available? <br/></b><span>  Since this is
our first project, we intend to start with colors introduced on our campaign for
now but we would like to hear color preferences from our supporters. If you let
us know any particular color, we will update based on preference and the
possibility to produce with the color you prefer. </span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><b>Does the
web page button at the bottom interfere when using wheel with thumb just like other vertical mice?<br/></b><span>  The web page button
at the bottom is designed to respond only by intentional click. We calculated
the depth of the button just enough to be touched by the thumb joint, so you
won’t be able to accidentally touch it.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><b>Do you have a wireless NEST mouse too?<br/></b><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> It depends on the financial situation. We
might be able to produce wireless too, but for now, we will focus on wired NEST
mouse first under the assumption that people normally dislike ""a sudden stop"" over long hours of serious projects due to batteries (including games) especially in the middle of night. We will update and notify if this situation changes.</span></p>
<p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'><br/></span></p>
<p><b>What about international shipping cost?<br/></b><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>  Shipping has been always an issue for any physical products in Indiegogo and we try to minimize the international
shipping cost as much as possible. We currently expect that the total weight for one
product including full package would be around 500g (approximately 17oz or
1.10lb) We try to squeeze shipping cost near countries(Japan, Singapore, HK,
China, Thailand, Vietnam etc) as much as we can and we intend to ship  less than
$20 per one product worldwide. In terms of legal issues on each country, if there are any restrictions on customs in your country,
shipping might take a little bit longer than we originally planned. <b>Please
check shipping cost when you contribute</b> and let us know if there is any special
restriction for our product in your country. </span></p>

We analyzed the shape of hands and have meticulously considered every

protect their hands as well as improve efficiency for long work hours or just using
your computer mouse. 
By pledging, you are not just
buying our product but have an opportunity to challenge the conventional concepts that have
been accepted without doubt, ignoring pains just like the
pain you feel on your wrist every time you use a mouse.
You can also support us by sharing this on any
SNS such as Facebook, Twitter or by email to your friends or by simply talking
about our product with someone who is interested.
Huge thanks for
your support!!!




FAQ
Does it
come in different sizes?   No. We analyzed
and researched extensive amount of data to ensure the NEST mouse is designed to
fit most of users. 

When will
new colors/versions be available?   Since this is
our first project, we intend to start with colors introduced on our campaign for
now but we would like to hear color preferences from our supporters. If you let
us know any particular color, we will update based on preference and the
possibility to produce with the color you prefer. 

Does the
web page button at the bottom interfere when using wheel with thumb just like other vertical mice?  The web page button
at the bottom is designed to respond only by intentional click. We calculated
the depth of the button just enough to be touched by the thumb joint, so you
won’t be able to accidentally touch it.

Do you have a wireless NEST mouse too? It depends on the financial situation. We
might be able to produce wireless too, but for now, we will focus on wired NEST
mouse first under the assumption that people normally dislike ""a sudden stop"" over long hours of serious projects due to batteries (including games) especially in the middle of night. We will update and notify if this situation changes.

What about international shipping cost?  Shipping has been always an issue for any physical products in Indiegogo and we try to minimize the international
shipping cost as much as possible. We currently expect that the total weight for one
product including full package would be around 500g (approximately 17oz or
1.10lb) We try to squeeze shipping cost near countries(Japan, Singapore, HK,
China, Thailand, Vietnam etc) as much as we can and we intend to ship  less than
$20 per one product worldwide. In terms of legal issues on each country, if there are any restrictions on customs in your country,
shipping might take a little bit longer than we originally planned. Please
check shipping cost when you contribute and let us know if there is any special
restriction for our product in your country.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Where did the idea come from?</h3>
<p>I'm a huge fan of old classics like Megaman, Metroid and Castlevania, and as modern games have grown and developed over time, classics like those have stayed in the past and apart from a very few games inspired on them or remakes/remasters, they are mostly just good memories now.</p>
<p>I miss them! So as a fan and a gamer myself, I'm trying to bring back what we loved about them, making something as fun while also keeping it fresh and interesting.</p>
<h3>The game</h3>
<p>You play as a dog, living in peace with his kind in Dog Village until a band of mercenaries break into their peaceful home and steal their sacred relic which has always protected them from harm. It's your duty as the player to track down the thieves and recover the stolen relic.</p>
<p>As a megaman inspired game, you face each mercenary individually and acquire their powers, which might be another mercenary's weakness or a way to access new locations that might reward you with extra abilities.</p>

Welcome!
Dogventure is a retro style 2D action platformer game inspired by the Megaman series, featuring RPG elements and an open world environment (or Metroidvania if you know of the term).
The video that you might've checked out at this point shows some of the game's mechanics and gives you and idea of how it looks and feels.
Where did the idea come from?
I'm a huge fan of old classics like Megaman, Metroid and Castlevania, and as modern games have grown and developed over time, classics like those have stayed in the past and apart from a very few games inspired on them or remakes/remasters, they are mostly just good memories now.
I miss them! So as a fan and a gamer myself, I'm trying to bring back what we loved about them, making something as fun while also keeping it fresh and interesting.
The game
You play as a dog, living in peace with his kind in Dog Village until a band of mercenaries break into their peaceful home and steal their sacred relic which has always protected them from harm. It's your duty as the player to track down the thieves and recover the stolen relic.
As a megaman inspired game, you face each mercenary individually and acquire their powers, which might be another mercenary's weakness or a way to access new locations that might reward you with extra abilities.



Unlike the classic Megaman, Dogventure will be open world and will feature upgradable abilities and shop items such as healing or temporary boosts.

<p>If you use your computer for several
hours in a day, just get your hands on the MOUSE ver 2  and you will never
turn back to your old mouse. This will happen because you will be able to rest
your hands without stopping your work.</p>
<p>A lot of people use mouse pad with gel
for supporting their wrist .I used it too, but this isn't the solution .<u>The
correct / </u><u>right</u><u> solution is to alternate the way of holding
the mouse</u></p>
<p><span></span>
</p>
<p><b>Using the Mouse ver 2, you will not use
continuously only one muscle group of your hand. Instead, you may alternate the
muscle groups of your hand you use. That way you can rest your hand without
stopping your work. So you will not bring your hands to the limits of their
injury.</b></p>
<p><b>eg <br/>
If you need to walk a long way using only one leg then surely shoes with air
soles will be helpful.</b><b>But what really makes the difference is
to use both legs alternately.</b></p>

<p><b>We have tested the work principle

<p>We played with comfort <b>starcraft

<p>We tried the mouse 2 and in strategy

<p>The result was to play starcraft 2

<p>Surfing. </p>
<p>Edit images.  </p>
<p>Check text in word.
(when you write a text and want to check it out and fix, it is very convenient

<p><b>The mouse ver2 is not like the touchpad or the touch screen of mobile phones.</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1029948/files/20141119124656-cat_pad_d.jpg?1416430016"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>The power and immediacy of the mouse cannot be compared with any other device.<br/><br/>There are apps for smart phones with which they take control of the PC from your mobile. The virtual keyboard is convenient. Conversely if you use the mouse for mobile you will quickly understand how it doesn't compare with the real mouse.<br/><br/>The same applies to other devices that are substitutes mouse and handle them with your fingers. For example, the touch pad doesn't compare to the immediacy of the mouse. If you try to play a demanding game with mouse like strategy, then you immediately abandon the effort.<br/><br/>The mouse2 uses the power and accuracy that has the sensor. <br/>The cat pad surface located on the bottom of the mouse 2 and makes the difference.<br/><br/>The mouse has an immediacy that does not have any other device. This is why it continues to be the number one device for controlling the computer.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What is the cat pad surface and what are its advantages.?</b><br/><br/>The catpad surface moves with ease and with great precision along the horizontal axis. It also rolls inside the smart mouse. Thereby, we have a huge surface which does not occupy any space. At the same time it can also move vertically.<br/><br/> Finally, as these movements can be made simultaneously, it offers us the freedom to move directly to any desired position. That is, to be able to move diagonally with a single movement unlike TV remote controls in which the movement occurs by pressing buttons. After all, the normal mouse has for many years been the number one way of operating a PC because of its sheer simplicity and immediacy in the use.<br/><br/>The catpad is a real pad surface that you hold and move as you do with the classic mouse. It is not an immaterial surface across which you drag your fingers.<br/><br/>This is of huge importance and it makes all the difference. And, that is the main reason why the classic mouse has this unparalleled success over the years. Our brain recognizes the information of an object being held by the hand more directly and “aggressively”.<br/><br/>It can perceive this type of movement better than an invisible finger movement over a surface.<br/><br/></p>

<b>""smart and free kit""</b><br/><br/>
<p>The mouse 2 can combine it with a mini
PC very small (like a DVD player) and silent operation specially for the Living
room and bedroom.</p>
<p>We shall call ""smart and free
kit"" this combination.</p>
<br/><p><span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1030118/files/20141119132120-1smartmouse-move.jpg?1416432080"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>The idea to make the SMART and FREE
kit started when I bought a</p>
<p>SMART TV .The disappointment was great
because I realized that it was not</p>
<p>Smart.  I wanted my SMART TV to
have the freedom and intelligence that gives my computer and not have mind
young child. And the disappointment grew even more when searching the internet
I realized that thousands of people have the same view as me.</p>
<p>Also the concept of SMART TV is more
simplistic than a PC.</p>
<p>This can be ok for someone but not for
me</p>
<p>I want to be able to run my favourite
programs on TV. Also because my hobby is the photographs I would be able to
make video editing on my TV when I'm in living room or play a game of strategy
when I'm lying on my couch.</p>
<p>One solution is to connect my computer
to the TV. But it is ""ugly"" and it is practically impossible to use
the classic keyboard and mouse in the living room. If we want, we can
put a mini computer ideal for living room but again the problem with the
keyboard and mouse still there.</p>
<p>The idea that solves the above problem
is the MOUSE ver 2 and the SMART and FREE kit.</p>
<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p>Also as a chronic user of classic mouse
(several hours a day) my wrists began to hurt. The alternative use of the Mouse
2 with the thumb and not with the wrist is a very pleasant change.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<b><u>Highlights</u></b>

<p><b>What is the usefulness of this package?</b></p>
<br/>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/845466/files/20140909120737-6.jpg?1410289657"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;The idea to have the computer in the
Living room is old. But the handling of the classic PC with mouse and keyboard
is practically impossible in living room or bedroom.&gt;</p>
<p><br/>
The mouse ver2 helps in resting your hand during the long hours on the computer
without stopping your work or your fun.</p>
<p>The mouse 2 allows the comfortable
combination of PC with the TV.</p>
<p>You can alter the TV to your super SMART
TV  with this package. The new operation (due to MOUSE VER2) is the one
that makes possible the use of computer in the living room .The MOUSE 2 is the
one that fits with the living room. (Not the classic mouse and keyboard)</p>
<p>The user will hold the same keyboard on
the road and on the couch.</p>
<p>The same keyboard which has become
familiar.</p>
<p>The computer and TV have the same control.</p>
<p>All televisions will be converted in super
smart TV with the  SMART and FREE kit.</p>
<br/><p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Operating mouse ver2.</b></p>
<p>The mouse ver2 can be used in two ways.
One is the known way of operating the mouse with the wrist. When the wrist is
tired, the smart mouse can give the solution. Just turn it upside down and
control the graphical user interface <b>(</b>GUI) of the computer with the
thumb!. This leads into too many new features and innovations. Even in protection
against some illnesses concerning the nerves of the hands caused by the use of
computer.</p>
<br/>
<p><span></span></p>

<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>(The picture shows how the user handles
the MOUSE 2 with thumb simply moving it on a surface. (As in all other devices). 
The user moves the finger on a mechanically supported surface  in 
MOUSE 2  . This implies a very significant improvement in the
functionality of the control pc with your thumb.)</p>
<p>The 1smart mouse is incredibly easy to
use.</p>
<p>As soon as we get tired of using it as
an ordinary mouse, we can simply flip it over and take control of our PC or TV
using our finger.</p>
<p>This control is achieved by moving the
catpad with our finger.</p>
<p>Our movements take immediate control of
the cursor.</p>
<p>The catpad technology is located at the
mouse base and operates with the thumb of the hand.</p>
<p></p>
<br/><p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Adding in the base of MOUSE 2 a small
virtual keyboard.</b></p>
<p><b>(For iPhone users will be issuing a
qualified socket to put their iPhone.)</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/845373/files/20140909113711-2_smart_phone_copy.jpg?1410287831"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The mouse 2 is a “suit” for the i phone.</p>
<p>Once the i phone ""puts it on"",
it can be converted into the ultimate controller of all the other home-use and
office devices.</p>
<p>Τhe 
i-phone can be put into the mouse2 with a simple move whenever the user wants.
There is a dock on the smart mouse base where the user’s own smart phone can be
placed.</p>
<p>This is connected to the computer via
the control of a remote computer connected to another. This activates a virtual
keyboard which is on the mouse base. So, in your hand lays a mouse and a
keyboard for total control of the PC.</p>
<p>(we will combine the virtual
keyboard  of  iPhone with the actual functionality of the mouse).</p>

<b>The MOUSE  VER2 will be built in
two phases.</b>
<p><b>A)</b>The  first version will have the
main features of MOUSE ver2.</p>
<p>1)The mouse 2 for
office "" two legs""</p>
<p>This model is
wired and has the main characteristics of the mouse 2. which will have the cat
pad. It is addressed primarily for use in the office computer. With this model
you can have all the benefits of alternative control computer. You can operate
the mouse 2 and the classic mode and the smart. So instead of doing all the way
with a ""foot"" you will be able to alternate with each other.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><span>This will be the first version we are
going to produce and you will get in your hands. The final design may be
different from what has now been designed. However, the focus will be the same.
To create an exclusive Mouse for living room and office.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><br/><b><span></span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><b>B)</b> Later after establishing a stable
production line we will enrich mouse ver 2 with extra features (Remote, game
pad, phone ,microphone)</p>
<p>1) The mouse 2 for iPhone</p>
<p>This model will be wireless and with the cat pad.It will have a slot to enable the user to introduce iPhone there. So
you ll have in the same hand at the same time the mouse and the keyboard.</p>
<p>2) The mouse 2 for sstv (Super Smart TV)</p>
<p>This model has the catpad and a virtual keyboard. This model is wireless. It is ideal for
use in the Living room , bedroom or office. It is proposed to be connected to a
TV mini Pc refinement. The combination of the mouse 2 for sstv will
significantly change the fun in living room.</p>

</div></div>","mouse ver2  






If you use your computer for several
hours in a day, just get your hands on the MOUSE ver 2  and you will never
turn back to your old mouse. This will happen because you will be able to rest
your hands without stopping your work.
A lot of people use mouse pad with gel
for supporting their wrist .I used it too, but this isn't the solution .The
correct / right solution is to alternate the way of holding
the mouse


Using the Mouse ver 2, you will not use
continuously only one muscle group of your hand. Instead, you may alternate the
muscle groups of your hand you use. That way you can rest your hand without
stopping your work. So you will not bring your hands to the limits of their
injury.
eg 
If you need to walk a long way using only one leg then surely shoes with air
soles will be helpful.But what really makes the difference is
to use both legs alternately.









See the
video below how it works 





We have tested the work principle
of mouse 2 in practice
We played with comfort starcraft
2 with the mouse 2.
We tried the mouse 2 and in strategy
games. Everyone knows that strategy games have great demands from the Mouse.
The result was to play starcraft 2
enjoying the comfort of the couch. 
Surfing. 
Edit images.  
Check text in word.
(when you write a text and want to check it out and fix, it is very convenient
to use the alternative use of the mouse 2)
All the above convinced us that the
mouse 2 will be surely the successor of the simple Mouse.




The mouse ver2 is not like the touchpad or the touch screen of mobile phones.


The power and immediacy of the mouse cannot be compared with any other device.There are apps for smart phones with which they take control of the PC from your mobile. The virtual keyboard is convenient. Conversely if you use the mouse for mobile you will quickly understand how it doesn't compare with the real mouse.The same applies to other devices that are substitutes mouse and handle them with your fingers. For example, the touch pad doesn't compare to the immediacy of the mouse. If you try to play a demanding game with mouse like strategy, then you immediately abandon the effort.The mouse2 uses the power and accuracy that has the sensor. The cat pad surface located on the bottom of the mouse 2 and makes the difference.The mouse has an immediacy that does not have any other device. This is why it continues to be the number one device for controlling the computer.

What is the cat pad surface and what are its advantages.?The catpad surface moves with ease and with great precision along the horizontal axis. It also rolls inside the smart mouse. Thereby, we have a huge surface which does not occupy any space. At the same time it can also move vertically. Finally, as these movements can be made simultaneously, it offers us the freedom to move directly to any desired position. That is, to be able to move diagonally with a single movement unlike TV remote controls in which the movement occurs by pressing buttons. After all, the normal mouse has for many years been the number one way of operating a PC because of its sheer simplicity and immediacy in the use.The catpad is a real pad surface that you hold and move as you do with the classic mouse. It is not an immaterial surface across which you drag your fingers.This is of huge importance and it makes all the difference. And, that is the main reason why the classic mouse has this unparalleled success over the years. Our brain recognizes the information of an object being held by the hand more directly and “aggressively”.It can perceive this type of movement better than an invisible finger movement over a surface.







""smart and free kit""
The mouse 2 can combine it with a mini
PC very small (like a DVD player) and silent operation specially for the Living
room and bedroom.
We shall call ""smart and free
kit"" this combination.


The idea to make the SMART and FREE
kit started when I bought a
SMART TV .The disappointment was great
because I realized that it was not
Smart.  I wanted my SMART TV to
have the freedom and intelligence that gives my computer and not have mind
young child. And the disappointment grew even more when searching the internet
I realized that thousands of people have the same view as me.
Also the concept of SMART TV is more
simplistic than a PC.
This can be ok for someone but not for
me
I want to be able to run my favourite
programs on TV. Also because my hobby is the photographs I would be able to
make video editing on my TV when I'm in living room or play a game of strategy
when I'm lying on my couch.
One solution is to connect my computer
to the TV. But it is ""ugly"" and it is practically impossible to use
the classic keyboard and mouse in the living room. If we want, we can
put a mini computer ideal for living room but again the problem with the
keyboard and mouse still there.
The idea that solves the above problem
is the MOUSE ver 2 and the SMART and FREE kit.



Also as a chronic user of classic mouse
(several hours a day) my wrists began to hurt. The alternative use of the Mouse
2 with the thumb and not with the wrist is a very pleasant change.

Highlights


What is the usefulness of this package?





<The idea to have the computer in the
Living room is old. But the handling of the classic PC with mouse and keyboard
is practically impossible in living room or bedroom.>

The mouse ver2 helps in resting your hand during the long hours on the computer
without stopping your work or your fun.
The mouse 2 allows the comfortable
combination of PC with the TV.
You can alter the TV to your super SMART
TV  with this package. The new operation (due to MOUSE VER2) is the one
that makes possible the use of computer in the living room .The MOUSE 2 is the
one that fits with the living room. (Not the classic mouse and keyboard)
The user will hold the same keyboard on
the road and on the couch.
The same keyboard which has become
familiar.
The computer and TV have the same control.
All televisions will be converted in super
smart TV with the  SMART and FREE kit.



Operating mouse ver2.
The mouse ver2 can be used in two ways.
One is the known way of operating the mouse with the wrist. When the wrist is
tired, the smart mouse can give the solution. Just turn it upside down and
control the graphical user interface (GUI) of the computer with the
thumb!. This leads into too many new features and innovations. Even in protection
against some illnesses concerning the nerves of the hands caused by the use of
computer.






(The picture shows how the user handles
the MOUSE 2 with thumb simply moving it on a surface. (As in all other devices). 
The user moves the finger on a mechanically supported surface  in 
MOUSE 2  . This implies a very significant improvement in the
functionality of the control pc with your thumb.)
The 1smart mouse is incredibly easy to
use.
As soon as we get tired of using it as
an ordinary mouse, we can simply flip it over and take control of our PC or TV
using our finger.
This control is achieved by moving the
catpad with our finger.
Our movements take immediate control of
the cursor.
The catpad technology is located at the
mouse base and operates with the thumb of the hand.




Adding in the base of MOUSE 2 a small
virtual keyboard.
(For iPhone users will be issuing a
qualified socket to put their iPhone.)



The mouse 2 is a “suit” for the i phone.
Once the i phone ""puts it on"",
it can be converted into the ultimate controller of all the other home-use and
office devices.
Τhe 
i-phone can be put into the mouse2 with a simple move whenever the user wants.
There is a dock on the smart mouse base where the user’s own smart phone can be
placed.
This is connected to the computer via
the control of a remote computer connected to another. This activates a virtual
keyboard which is on the mouse base. So, in your hand lays a mouse and a
keyboard for total control of the PC.
(we will combine the virtual
keyboard  of  iPhone with the actual functionality of the mouse).








The MOUSE  VER2 will be built in
two phases.
A)The  first version will have the
main features of MOUSE ver2.
1)The mouse 2 for
office "" two legs""
This model is
wired and has the main characteristics of the mouse 2. which will have the cat
pad. It is addressed primarily for use in the office computer. With this model
you can have all the benefits of alternative control computer. You can operate
the mouse 2 and the classic mode and the smart. So instead of doing all the way
with a ""foot"" you will be able to alternate with each other.


This will be the first version we are
going to produce and you will get in your hands. The final design may be
different from what has now been designed. However, the focus will be the same.
To create an exclusive Mouse for living room and office.



B) Later after establishing a stable
production line we will enrich mouse ver 2 with extra features (Remote, game
pad, phone ,microphone)
1) The mouse 2 for iPhone
This model will be wireless and with the cat pad.It will have a slot to enable the user to introduce iPhone there. So
you ll have in the same hand at the same time the mouse and the keyboard.
2) The mouse 2 for sstv (Super Smart TV)
This model has the catpad and a virtual keyboard. This model is wireless. It is ideal for
use in the Living room , bedroom or office. It is proposed to be connected to a
TV mini Pc refinement. The combination of the mouse 2 for sstv will
significantly change the fun in living room.

We are
passionate about the idea of mouse2. We believe that this will be the natural
successor to the classic mouse.
The mouse 2 is a new invention that has
been submitted to the industrial property organization.
We invest a lot of money and time in
research, experimentation, the 3D design, engineers , lawyers and to the
industrial property organization.
We have built several prototypes to test
the idea. We have not built yet exactly what is shown in pictures.


Development time
    We need your help to
develop mouse 2 and start mass production. Then mouse 2 will come the next
generation mouse .You'll be the first to receive mouse 2  at a price
significantly less than future retail price. We hope that you like the Mouse 2
and we are sure it will impress your friends, people you know and even your
customers. It will also radically change the way you use your TV and your computer.

Currently we don’t have the prototype
that you see at this photos. Prototypes that we have done are to check the
basic function of the MOUSE 2. Our task is to bring our model the closest to
the technical ideal. We will do our best to achieve this. The individual
elements of the Mouse 2 are technologies that exist.

<p>It's Tuesday 23rd July - you can now buy a Leap Motion controller.  They're only about 90 bucks, even with shipping, so buy one immediately.</p>
<p>I've already got clients piled up who want demos and what-not of games using the Leap, and I'm sure you do too.</p>
<h2>It's time for Leap, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">in the Unity Editor</span>, for us developers.</h2>
<p>Let's do it straight away.</p>
<p>You get the idea - you'll be able to turn objects in the editor and move them in 3D, by moving yout hand.</p>
<p>I know exactly what is needed here from fooling with it so much. And from spending 50 hours a week in the Unity editor fr a few years, phew! We need to be able to move objects around precisely - almost certainly with various lock-offs and step-offs.</p>
<p>There need to be a couple of general modes that you can use immediately, by sliding your hand over your keyboard, to affect the whole scene - rotating your view and so on.</p>
<p>The software needs to have a modicum of intelligence to understand the general scale of your scene and what you're after when you move your hand.</p>
<p>It's gonna be fantastic, <strong>so it's time for crowdfunding</strong>. Yeah! If, and only if, enough people are interested, let's do it. If nobody is interested, them the only thing wasted is me typing this much text. (And I seem to do that every day on the answers site, anyway - so no problem!)</p>
<p>Here's a quick demo of using the Leap if you don't have one yet...</p>
<p><a href=""http://smhk.com/leap.mov"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""blank""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://smhk.com/leap.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>That's Brad Larson's well-known ""molecules"" program with a Leap interface.</p>
<p>(Actually, I think most of the game demos as such available so far for the Leap pretty much suck - I think that demo is the best one. If you know of a decent game on Leap, <strong>let me know</strong> straight away, thanks.)</p>

<p>Have you noticed these sort of articles always end with a ""call to action""?</p>
<p>That's because the world needs action! If there aren't at least 90 people who want this, it's not worth bothering with and it won't happen. If you don't have a Leap yet, click over to Leap to get one now - it's less than $100, and everyone needs one in our field. And then, yes, click up there and please choose a $50 ""perk"" - this is rawfunding! Unless 90 people sign up, it won't happen!  Cheers!!</p></span></span></div>","Hey guys, it's ""Fattie"" from the Unity lists.
It's Tuesday 23rd July - you can now buy a Leap Motion controller.  They're only about 90 bucks, even with shipping, so buy one immediately.
I've already got clients piled up who want demos and what-not of games using the Leap, and I'm sure you do too.
It's time for Leap, in the Unity Editor, for us developers.
Let's do it straight away.
You get the idea - you'll be able to turn objects in the editor and move them in 3D, by moving yout hand.
I know exactly what is needed here from fooling with it so much. And from spending 50 hours a week in the Unity editor fr a few years, phew! We need to be able to move objects around precisely - almost certainly with various lock-offs and step-offs.
There need to be a couple of general modes that you can use immediately, by sliding your hand over your keyboard, to affect the whole scene - rotating your view and so on.
The software needs to have a modicum of intelligence to understand the general scale of your scene and what you're after when you move your hand.
It's gonna be fantastic, so it's time for crowdfunding. Yeah! If, and only if, enough people are interested, let's do it. If nobody is interested, them the only thing wasted is me typing this much text. (And I seem to do that every day on the answers site, anyway - so no problem!)
Here's a quick demo of using the Leap if you don't have one yet...

That's Brad Larson's well-known ""molecules"" program with a Leap interface.
(Actually, I think most of the game demos as such available so far for the Leap pretty much suck - I think that demo is the best one. If you know of a decent game on Leap, let me know straight away, thanks.)
(By the way, I think the use of the Leap there is good, but could be even better. The damping and locking needs to be really thought out, particularly for our needs as Unity developers, which is exactly what I'm gonna do for LeapForUnity. As you know I am obsessed with input precision, and this is an unexplored field.)

You're totally capable of deciding if you want this to work with, without me playing you a jingle or having a stupid expensive logo made.
I reckon this should be called rawfunding ... when someone makes a no-nonsense crowdfunding campaign!
(1) it has to be the traditional ""you only get the money if you reach your goal"" type of campaign.
(2) you cannot have fancy production values for the campaign. you cannot pay for logos, mockups, design, illustrators and so on.
(3) youmust spend no more than three or four hours writing out the campaign. It's taken me about three hours to make this page on IGG (mostly because it took me 2.9 hours to figure out how the hell to move a video from my iPad to the page - and it still doesn't work right, but never mind).

<h3>Sleeves!</h3>
<p><span>Card sleeves are still being sold in packs of 50 but we're playing games with more cards than ever. Let's change the way premium sleeves are sold by showing everyone that high quality sleeves can be shipped and delivered at a much more reasonable price!</span></p>
<p>Because the minimum quantity from the manufacturer is huge, we'll need to pool together to purchase a big order. To keep shipping costs down, we'll ship sleeves as densely as possible in the cheapest packaging possible. So get your friends to pool together to back the best perk for you and yours. Together, we'll protect our cards and our wallets.</p>
<ul>
<li>100 micron <strong>premium</strong> sleeves</li>
<li>transparent both sides</li>
<li>standard card game (63.5 x 88mm) and euro card size (59 x 92mm)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What if we pass our goal?</h3>
<p>If we pass our funding goal we'll be able to purchase a buffer of card sleeves. We'll add a percentage of extra sleeves to every order to make them even cheaper and offset the occasional fluke sleeve.</p>
<p>If we pass our funding goal by a lot, we'll be able to customize orders to have a more specific mix of the two sleeve sizes. At the end of the project I will send out a survey and people can request a mix of sleeves more customized than they perk they selected. As the number of supporters increases (and therefore the level of funding) we'll be able to afford a big enough buffer that we can be more liberal with mixing sleeve sizes.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's with the shipping quantities?</h3>
<p><span>Each quantity is the largest we can deliver in the cheapest mode of delivery possible. In that way, the shipping cost per sleeve is as low as possible. All shipments will be going through USPS flat rate boxes. The 750 quantity is in the small box, the 2500 and 5000 are in the medium, and the 7500 is in the large flat rate box.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Can you tell me more about shipping?</h3>
<p><span>We've made shipping as cheap as possible because it is a huge cost per sleeve. The table below summarizes the estimated costs.</span></p>
<p><img alt=""Shipping table summarizing shipping costs to various destinations"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/64797465/Sleeves_ship.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The top, green lines are the actual projected cost of shipping to each destination. The red lines are how much extra it costs to ship to non-USA destinations. The blue lines are the premium we are asking from Canada and other International destinations. The purple lines are what is left of those premiums after Indiegogo, paypal, etc fees. The orange lines are the result of the purple lines less the red lines. In other words, the orange lines show how much we are subsidizing delivery to non-USA destinations (about fifty cents give or take). </p>
<p>We're sorry it costs so much to ship internationally, but we cannot afford to subsidize deliveries more than we already are. Hopefully everyone understands. </p>
<h2>Why do you not recommend the 750 sleeve internationally?</h2>
<p>If you want the 750 quantity internationally, go for it. We're happy to oblige, but it really isn't that great a deal since shipping costs so much. You're much better off finding a group of friends to go in on a higher quantity so you can split the shipping. </p>
<p>Second, international shipments in small flat rate boxes do not allow package tracking. A lot of countries have unreliable postal services. If you decide to back a reward level that ships in a small flat rate box internationally, you'll be accepting the risk of non-delivery. For both of these reasons, we recommend quantities that ship in medium or large flat rate packages for international supporters.</p>
<h2>What if I want even more?</h2>
<p><span>You can add an additional order of any perk level to any perk level. That's a mouthful, so let's parse that out. No matter what perk you select, you can add another perk level by increasing your pledge amount by that perk amount. So if you are already an Addicted Standard Gamer in the USA ($185) and you want to also be an Addicted Euro Gamer in the USA ($185), you can pledge $370 and get both. You'll specify what you want in your additional order in the final survey. Unfortunately, we cannot offer shipping discounts for larger orders because we already have shipping as cheap as it can possibly get.</span></p>

So here it comes, the next SaikoroWars, we will keep the same name and change everything about it.  Our previous SaikoroWars was an event for (Cosplay, anime,video games, board games and comics)



Every year we collaborate and organize an event, we always go ahead with what suits your needs and mostly you have a blast; this year however, we will do something different, now not only you can choose or suggest idea, you can actually contribute and force us to do it.



NINXA & SandSeerS have been collaborating together to bring the best quality and enjoyment compacted within all their events since 2012.The perks not only awards you tickets and freebies, we also make you decide which merchant and/or activity to include in the convention; we also plan to have guests included within the perks, pay for them and meet them!Ticket perksWe have few kind of ticket it goes as following:Shops & OffersWe are making deals with well-known shops, we will bring them for free if you fund them, some shops refuse to participate in events because it cost 30-50 BHD per table, and it cost us passes, renting tables, chairs, and advertising for them; so what we are offering them is to participate for free, but give away up to 25% discount for the people who help them attend, you can suggest any shop by mail to share@sandseers.com with contact number to make it easier. If we could fund them all, they will be here.For example: GCC Otaku is willing to attend if his fans fund his table and in return he will give 20% off exclusive to the claimers.Your idea to realityDuring our previous events we always had our fans on Facebook and other social media websites suggest or rant about something saying “why don't you guys bring this DJ”, “create a trivia based on...” or “make a tournament in...”Now you can just tell us by email: share@sandseers.com and we will add a perk for it, with the cost needed and number of claims, when its full funded we will make it happen!Our first idea is Live Action Role Play or LARP for short; we may sell or rent the props (Helmet, Sword, Shield), for more information about LARP watch the video below:One of the popular LARP events:Meet your guest

Special ticket, pay for any Perk with a guest and you gain VIP 2 days + meet with the guest 1 on 1 for 10 minutes.


Suggest a guest via social@ninxa.com


Advertise for the guest you want, so we can bring him over.


We have to contact the guest and convince him to come over, and it will cost us a lot but it will be worth it.

Other Ways You Can HelpWe accept all kinds of support to make this happen, finance isn’t the only thing we need, in fact volunteering might be bigger help than money in this phase, share the news and spread it out will help us reach our goal faster.Are we joking?  Hmm I wouldn't believe it if I saw it in any other post, but well you know, its from your money so why not.Ticket cost roughly 550 BHD, for 10 days, and 540 BHD for accommodation, 150 BHD pocket money per day for 10 days (1500 BHD). So that is 2600 BHD.If we raise enough for it, we will award this to one of the lucky attendants at the event, in return the winner will promote us via pictures and videos containing our brands.The trip will be after a month from the event, we might have to convert the funds, if it didn't reach the event amount, but that is highly unlikely.The local currency is Bahraini Dinars (BHD); that is 1 BHD: 3.75 USD. After IndieGoGo and credit card fees the $18,000.00 will turn to approximately $16,415.00, which after exchange and transaction fees to something around 6,180.000 Bahraini Dinars.This amount is going to be used purely to fund the convention as followed in details.Venue:

""I have seen, heard and played quite a few visual novels in my life. But i have to say that Prose Edda´s and Moonstar´s “Sekaiju Yggdrasil” tops most of them.
Just the voice acting (there´s some really talented voice actors in the game!) and humor alone makes Sekaiju Yggdrasil worth a try (the game has awesome graphics as well).""  Robin “V-Act” Ek The Gaming Ground",24.0,3,"1 Campaign
