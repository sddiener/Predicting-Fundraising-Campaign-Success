<p><i>We are Thomas and Julien, two cousins that come from very different backgrounds - marketing and technology - but that share the same passionate idea: to create <b>the first visual and collaborative encyclopedia!</b> </i></p>
<p><i><b>This is big! </b>This is why we need your support.</i></p>
<p><i>We have already developed a good part of the technology, amongst others a visual and interactive format which we called VISU©, foundation of the encyclopedia.</i>

<p>Visupedia® offers a <b>totally new way to search and navigate
the web and to understand any topic</b>, thus creating a new kind of visual
and interactive encyclopedia.</p>
<p>By
interconnecting visuals, Visupedia® will allow people <b>to easily find,
understand and buy things among millions of items - even when they don't know their name or have a reference or even an image available.</b></p>
<p>So Visupedia® proposes an innovative solution to day-to-day problems:</p>

<p>Start your search using an item or product that is close to what your are looking for, navigate
through visual categories and tagged images, find it and directly if necessary buy it directly.</p>

<h3>Business models</h3>
<p>Visupedia®'s incomes are based on 2 complementary business models: </p>
<b>B2B model - Visupedia® for business (MYVISU©)</b>
<p></p>
<p>Use of our technology and the VISU© format for professional purposes, embedded in any web media. <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This model is </span><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">already active for paying customers</b><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">. </span></p>

<p></p>
<b>B2C model - Product placement</b>
<p>This is where YOU can earn money by contributing to the encyclopedia!</p>
<p>Highly qualified commercial products linked to the visual content will be strategically positioned for visitors that need to purchase the searched item, once found.</p>
<p>These products will be fetched from existing commercial catalogues. Such affiliate programs do pay out commissions to the lead generator. Visupedia® shares this revenue with the main contributor to thank you for the contributing.</p>
<p><i><b>Earn money by sharing your knowledge!</b></i></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Competition</h3>
<p>Of course, powerful solutions such as sophisticated search engines or visual recognition systems already exist.</p>
<p>However, those solutions always <b>require the users to know the name or reference</b> of what they are looking for, <b>or eventually have its image</b> so that they can try to have it automatically recognized.<br/></p>
<p><b><i>Visupedia® side-steps the need to know the name or have an image. How cool is that?</i></b></p>

</div>
<div>
<p>We need $50 000 to cover the costs of our team and infrastructure. </p>
<p>The <b>activities</b> we will undertake to deploy Visupedia® Alpha are:<br/></p> <ul> <li>Minor adjustments and further development of our technology</li>
<li>Connecting our system to commercial databases to offer the right products on the right page</li>
<li>Enhancement of our search engine to enable you to find what you are looking for throughout Visupedia® Alpha's content</li>
<li>Setting up a cool homepage with a feed of featured VISU©</li>
<li>A few new features to further enhance the format, such as including the possibility to tag 3D models</li>

<li><b>Our endless love! </b></li>

</ul>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Being the first to create a VISU© on a topic is great. Being the owner of a VISU© made by our experienced graphic designers is even better!

<br/>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>It is not all about money. We also need visibility! So go ahead and share this campaign on your social networks, tell your friends, co-workers and family about this great project.</p>
<p>You can also create a VISU© with our brand new editor on <a href=""https://editor.myvisu.com/?utm_source=indiegogo&amp;utm_medium=crowd&amp;utm_content=editor&amp;utm_campaign=crowdfunding"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #e30066 !important;"">editor.myvisu.com</a> and publish anywhere you want for free.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What if?</h3>
<p>Yep, we opted for flex-funding. Deploying a first version of Visupedia® requires quite some efforts and the $50 000 won't cover all the costs anyway. We are dealing with other sources of fundings to help us out getting to this cool objective. </p>
<p>Whatever happens we will deliver the VISU© ordered by our backers.</p>

<h3>Modèles d’affaires</h3>
<p>Les revenus de Visupedia® se basent sur deux modèles d’affaires complémentaires.</p>
<b>Modèle B2B - Visupedia® pro (MYVISU©)</b>
<p></p>
<p>Il s’agit de l’utilisation professionnelle du format VISU©, intégré dans tout type de média en ligne. <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Ce modèle est </span><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">déjà actif auprès de clients</b><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">. </span></p>

<p></p>
<b>Modèle B2C – Placement de produits</b>
<p>C’est dans ce modèle que VOUS pourrez gagner de l’argent en contribuant au contenu de l’encyclopédie.</p>
<p>En effet, des produits commerciaux, liés de manière très sélective au contenu encyclopédique, seront affichés pour offrir des achats directs aux visiteurs.</p>
<p>Ces produits proviendront de bases de données commerciales existantes, dans le cadre de programmes d’affiliation rémunérant des commissions sur les ventes provenant des affiliés. Visupedia®, en tant qu’affilié principal, partagera ses revenus avec les contributeurs principaux, pour les récompenser de leurs contributions encyclopédiques.</p>
<p><i><b>Gagnez donc de l’argent en partageant vos connaissances!</b></i></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Concurrence</h3>
<p>Bien sûr, des solutions perfectionnées existent, tels que les moteurs de recherche ou les systèmes de reconnaissance visuelle.</p>
<p>Cependant, ces solutions nécessitent de <b>connaître le nom ou la référence de ce qu’on recherche ou alors de disposer de l’objet (ou de son image) </b>afin qu’il soit traité par les systèmes de reconnaissance visuelle.<br/></p>
<p><b><i>Avec Visupedia®, plus besoin de connaître le nom ou d’avoir l’objet ou son image pour entamer des recherches. Cool, non?</i></b></p>

Hi there!
We are Thomas and Julien, two cousins that come from very different backgrounds - marketing and technology - but that share the same passionate idea: to create the first visual and collaborative encyclopedia! 
This is big! This is why we need your support.
We have already developed a good part of the technology, amongst others a visual and interactive format which we called VISU©, foundation of the encyclopedia.



Navigate in a VISU©!


This campaign is being launched to help us deploy a first public version of Visupedia®, displaying all the created VISU©.
This is critically important for us as several investors are waiting for the first traction from the community to heavily invest in the next version of Visupedia®.
Thomas & Julien


Problems & Solutions


Visupedia® offers a totally new way to search and navigate
the web and to understand any topic, thus creating a new kind of visual
and interactive encyclopedia.
By
interconnecting visuals, Visupedia® will allow people to easily find,
understand and buy things among millions of items - even when they don't know their name or have a reference or even an image available.
So Visupedia® proposes an innovative solution to day-to-day problems:

How do you easily find and buy things, among millions of items, when you don't even know their name or have a reference?
Start your search using an item or product that is close to what your are looking for, navigate
through visual categories and tagged images, find it and directly if necessary buy it directly.
What is the name of this small spare part of my bike that broke?



Try it out live!

How do you get to understand how to install, use, repair or maintain these things?


Clearly explain and learn about any kind of process by breaking it down into visual steps.
How can I replace this part? Where could I find a sort of IKEA manual to replace it?


Try it out live!



Business models
Visupedia®'s incomes are based on 2 complementary business models: 
B2B model - Visupedia® for business (MYVISU©)

Use of our technology and the VISU© format for professional purposes, embedded in any web media. This model is already active for paying customers. 
Live examples & more info on www.myvisu.com.

B2C model - Product placement
This is where YOU can earn money by contributing to the encyclopedia!
Highly qualified commercial products linked to the visual content will be strategically positioned for visitors that need to purchase the searched item, once found.
These products will be fetched from existing commercial catalogues. Such affiliate programs do pay out commissions to the lead generator. Visupedia® shares this revenue with the main contributor to thank you for the contributing.
Earn money by sharing your knowledge!

Competition
Of course, powerful solutions such as sophisticated search engines or visual recognition systems already exist.
However, those solutions always require the users to know the name or reference of what they are looking for, or eventually have its image so that they can try to have it automatically recognized.
Visupedia® side-steps the need to know the name or have an image. How cool is that?

Roadmap

2013 - VISU©: 
Development
of our universal visual & interactive format
Bringing our concept into life, we have created VISU©, a proprietary format that enables us to categorize, describe and explain any topic using tagged visuals. To ensure our format is universal, we have created 12 000 tagged visuals in very different domains. This format can then be embedded on any web media.VISU© is the foundation of the encyclopedia.

See live examples!

2014 - MYVISU©: 
Commercialization of our B2B product to paying customers
To further test our format, we launched VISU© for paying companies that needed to describe complex products or explain how and why to install, use and maintain them

2015Q2 - VISU© EDITOR:  Deployment of an online editor
We are launching a VISU© editor that allows anyone to create and publish VISU© for free. The editor will be used to create and publish VISU© within Visupedia® Alpha.
Try it now!
Or if you don't feel comfortable with technology but sill want to discover how easy it is to create a VISU©, go check out this short video.

2015Q3-Q4 - VISUPEDIA® ALPHA: First version of the encyclopedia
With your help, we would like to launch a first platform for the encyclopedia. Most of the features envisioned for the final platform will already be available. The main objective is to get one step closer to the encyclopedia as well as to demonstrate just how useful it can be.
This is why we need your help - help us to make it happen!


2016 - VISUPEDIA®: The visual & collaborative encyclopedia
We have received strong interests in the final project from business angels and Venture Capital firms. However they would like to see public traction from the B2C market. We have to launch Visupedia® Alpha to demonstrate this, and of course show your interest in the platform! 


What We Need & What You Get


We need $50 000 to cover the costs of our team and infrastructure. 
The activities we will undertake to deploy Visupedia® Alpha are:  Minor adjustments and further development of our technology
Connecting our system to commercial databases to offer the right products on the right page
Enhancement of our search engine to enable you to find what you are looking for throughout Visupedia® Alpha's content
Setting up a cool homepage with a feed of featured VISU©
A few new features to further enhance the format, such as including the possibility to tag 3D models
Import of the content of the encyclopedia we have already created
Import of some free visual databases to increase the content 



What you get for your help:



Our endless love! 

We will never forget the first people that helped Visupedia® become a reality. Backers will always be in our heart and will be the first to know about news and exclusive advantages.


Crowdfunder badge

Show that you were amongst the first to support Visupedia® on the website itself.

Early access to Visupedia® Alpha - from $20!

At the time of launch, we will restrict the ability to create VISU© within Visupedia® Alpha for 2 weeks. That way, you get the first choice of topics you would like to create and therefore be the first to earn money on these topics.

Be a Visupedian and sponsor a VISU©

Being the first to create a VISU© on a topic is great. Being the owner of a VISU© made by our experienced graphic designers is even better! Let us create a beautiful VISU© on your favorite topics and we will add your picture or company logo as its creator. Choose packages from 1 to 100 images that we will create for you.

Premium pledge

From $5 000, you become one of the gang. You get your portrait made by our graphic designers together with the first funders and we will involve you in the development and design of Visupedia® Alpha. It will all start with a lunch at the company offices with the 2 co-founders and will follow with regular updates and requests for your opinion throughout the development of Visupedia® Alpha.



Other Ways You Can Help It is not all about money. We also need visibility! So go ahead and share this campaign on your social networks, tell your friends, co-workers and family about this great project.
You can also create a VISU© with our brand new editor on editor.myvisu.com and publish anywhere you want for free.


What if?
Yep, we opted for flex-funding. Deploying a first version of Visupedia® requires quite some efforts and the $50 000 won't cover all the costs anyway. We are dealing with other sources of fundings to help us out getting to this cool objective. 
Whatever happens we will deliver the VISU© ordered by our backers.

We already thank your for your help and support!




Version en Français


Bonjour à tous !
Nous sommes Julien et Thomas, deux cousins venant d’horizons très différents – Marketing & Technologie – mais qui partagent un même rêve : créer la première encyclopédie visuelle et collaborative! 
Ce n’est évidemment pas une mince affaire! C’est pour cela que nous avons besoin de votre aide précieuse.
A ce jour, nous avons déjà développé une bonne partie de la technologie du projet, dont un format visuel et interactif – qsurnommé VISU© - qui est la base de la future encyclopédie.



Naviguer dans un VISU©!


Cette campagne a pour objectif de nous aider à lancer une première version publique de Visupedia® permettant d’afficher tous les VISU© créés.
C’est un projet crucial pour nous, car plusieurs investisseurs attendent que nous leur prouvions l’intérêt d’une première communauté avant d’investir de manière conséquente dans la prochaine version de Visupedia®.
Thomas & Julien


Problèmes & Solutions


En connectant des visuels entre eux, Visupedia® proposera une toute nouvelle façon de trouver, de comprendre et d’acheter des objets parmi des millions d’articles, et ce, sans même connaître leur nom ou détenir leur image.
Ainsi, Visupedia® présentera une solution innovante pour répondre à des problèmes de la vie de tous les jours :

Comment trouver et acheter facilement des objets parmi des millions d’articles, sans même connaître leur nom ou détenir leur image?
Prenez comme point de départ de votre recherche un objet ou un article proche de celui que vous recherchez, naviguez à travers des catégories visuelles et des visuels tagués et trouvez ou achetez directement ce que vous recherchiez.
Quel est le nom de cette petite pièce défectueuse de mon vélo?



Naviguez dans ce VISU©

Comment installer, utiliser, entretenir et réparer ces objets facilement?


Expliquez et apprenez sans difficulté tout type de procédures en les découpant en explications visuelles « étape par étape ».
Comment remplacer cette pièce? Où trouver une explication aussi claire qu’un manuel IKEA?


Naviguez dans ce VISU©



Modèles d’affaires
Les revenus de Visupedia® se basent sur deux modèles d’affaires complémentaires.
Modèle B2B - Visupedia® pro (MYVISU©)

Il s’agit de l’utilisation professionnelle du format VISU©, intégré dans tout type de média en ligne. Ce modèle est déjà actif auprès de clients. 
Retrouvez des exemples et plus d’infos sur www.myvisu.com.

Modèle B2C – Placement de produits
C’est dans ce modèle que VOUS pourrez gagner de l’argent en contribuant au contenu de l’encyclopédie.
En effet, des produits commerciaux, liés de manière très sélective au contenu encyclopédique, seront affichés pour offrir des achats directs aux visiteurs.
Ces produits proviendront de bases de données commerciales existantes, dans le cadre de programmes d’affiliation rémunérant des commissions sur les ventes provenant des affiliés. Visupedia®, en tant qu’affilié principal, partagera ses revenus avec les contributeurs principaux, pour les récompenser de leurs contributions encyclopédiques.
Gagnez donc de l’argent en partageant vos connaissances!

Concurrence
Bien sûr, des solutions perfectionnées existent, tels que les moteurs de recherche ou les systèmes de reconnaissance visuelle.
Cependant, ces solutions nécessitent de connaître le nom ou la référence de ce qu’on recherche ou alors de disposer de l’objet (ou de son image) afin qu’il soit traité par les systèmes de reconnaissance visuelle.
Avec Visupedia®, plus besoin de connaître le nom ou d’avoir l’objet ou son image pour entamer des recherches. Cool, non?

Feuille de route

2013 - VISU©: 
Développement de notre format visuel et interactif
Dans un premier temps, nous avons créé VISU©, notre format « propriétaire » qui permet de catégoriser, de décrire et d'expliquer tout type de sujets via des visuels tagués. Pour s’assurer de l’universalité de notre format, nous avons créé 12 000  visuels tagués, dans de nombreux domaines. Ce format peut être ensuite intégré dans tout type de médias en ligne.VISU© est le format de base qui sera utilisé dans l’encyclopédie.

Voir des exemples de VISU©

2014 - MYVISU©: 
Commercialisation de VISU© auprès de clients professionnels
Afin de tester davantage notre format, nous avons commencé à vendre la création de VISU© à des sociétés désireuses de décrire leurs produits complexes ou d’expliquer comment et pourquoi installer, utiliser ou entretenir ces produits.

2015Q2 - VISU© EDITOR:  Déploiement d’un éditeur de VISU© en ligne
Nous venons de lancer un éditeur de VISU© permettant, à tous, de créer et de publier gratuitement des VISU©. Cet éditeur sera utilisé pour créer et publier des VISU dans l’encyclopédie.
Testez-le!
Si vous n’êtes pas à l’aise avec les logiciels informatiques, mais que vous souhaitez constater à quel point il est facile de créer un VISU©, nous vous invitons à visionner cette courte vidéo.

2015Q3-Q4 - VISUPEDIA® ALPHA: La première version de Visupedia®
Grâce à vous, nous souhaiterions lancer une première version de l’encyclopédie comprenant la majorité des fonctionnalités de la plateforme finale de Visupedia®. L’objectif principal est de s’approcher de l’encyclopédie et de démontrer son utilité.
C’est pourquoi nous sollicitons votre précieuse aide!


2016 - VISUPEDIA®: L’encyclopédie visuelle et collaborative
Des « Business Angels » et des fonds d’investissements ont marqué un vif intérêt pour notre projet. Cependant, ceux-ci souhaitent que nous leur prouvions au préalable l’intérêt grandissant d’une première communauté d’utilisateurs pour notre solution. Visupedia® Alpha a donc pour objectif principal de démontrer cet intérêt!


Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous y gagnez


Nous avons besoin de $50 000 pour couvrir les coûts de notre équipe et de notre infrastructure IT.
Cela implique les développements suivants:
 Des ajustements et des développements mineurs de notre technologie actuelle
Relier notre solution à des bases de données commerciales afin de proposer le bon produit, au bon endroit
L’amélioration de notre moteur de recherche afin de vous permettre de trouver ce que vous recherchez dans le contenu de Visupedia® Alpha
La création d’une superbe « homepage » affichant un flux d’une sélection de VISU©

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Science Connected is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit publisher of science nonfiction for a general audience and resources for science teachers. This organization was created by Kate Stone as an answer to a question: if science is for everyone, why do so many factors make it inaccessible? From paywalls to jargon, barriers to science keep many keen learners from excelling in STEM fields. Meanwhile, researchers often struggle to reach wider audiences. Science Connected bridges that knowledge gap.</p>

<p>Science Connected expands accessibility of scientific research. Our largest ongoing project is our online magazine, <a href=""http://gotscience.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GotScience</a>, which exists to make science accessible to everyone. Whether or not you’re a member of an institute doesn’t matter—if you have an interest in the sciences and an internet connection, GotScience allows you to learn about the latest scientific research and applications. Our material is accessible in that it is available online for free, and is easy for the general public to understand. This publication aims to expand the science community beyond its traditional boundaries. <a href=""http://www.gotscience.org/about-us/staff/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Meet the GotScience contributors here</a> to learn about our multinational team of highly skilled journalists and photographers.</p>
<p>We are proud to share with you some of our other projects:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Enhance the classroom. </strong>In 2016, we distributed classroom discussion guides for high school and middle school to 250 teachers and will soon be partnering with a local group to develop a science-oriented after-school learning program. Science literacy can be fun and interactive, and we want students and teachers alike to enjoy learning about science.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Train science writers. </strong>We have trained a dedicated volunteer group of journalists to report on astronomy, biology, chemistry, paleontology, physics, and more for our online publication <a href=""http://gotscience.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GotScience Magazine</a>. Our writers review books, interview researchers and labs, and occasionally report on their own projects. About 75 percent of the research reported by GotScience is not otherwise available to the general public. Most academic papers are still tucked away in journals behind expensive paywalls.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Promote and facilitate citizen science.</strong> As members of the Citizen Science Association, we support and report on efforts to conserve, create, question, and contribute to scientific research. We build bridges between people and science.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Collaborate between disciplines. </strong>We work closely with researchers to faithfully represent their projects and findings to the public. By forming relationships with science organizations, both large and small, we can share news about scientific discoveries that comes directly from the source.

<h3>How you can help us move forward</h3>
<p>We want to do even more. We need $5,000 to move to the next phase of freely accessible science distribution. Here's what we plan to do with those funds:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Community partnerships. </strong>Science isn’t just for schools or researchers—it’s for everyone. That’s why we want to be able to work with citizen science groups, social and political organizations, and any other interested community members to create accessible STEM literacy programs and events.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Expanded publishing.</strong> As well as bringing more STEM programs to our local communities, we want to make sure that our resources are available globally. A greater budget would allow a better platform for our online magazine, increased staff capacity, and an improved ability to print and distribute our teacher resources.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>More science. </strong>With the ability to join professional organizations, subscribe to journals, attend conferences, and otherwise increase our own access to research, we will be better able to provide our readers with original, well-written information from a wider variety of sources.</p>

Who we are
Science Connected is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit publisher of science nonfiction for a general audience and resources for science teachers. This organization was created by Kate Stone as an answer to a question: if science is for everyone, why do so many factors make it inaccessible? From paywalls to jargon, barriers to science keep many keen learners from excelling in STEM fields. Meanwhile, researchers often struggle to reach wider audiences. Science Connected bridges that knowledge gap.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This in-depth, historical documentary will discuss and highlight the contrasting difference between the historical Calendar observed during Biblical times and the Calendar observed today.</p>
<p>It will document the changes to the Biblical Calendar; who changed it; when did it change; and why. It clarifies the misconceptions on the exact days of the death, burial, resurrection of Messiah, and how it completely fulfilled the sacrificial requirements mandated in the Torah (The Law).</p>
<p>Understanding Heaven's Time-Clock is paramount to unlocking many of the hidden keys within the prophetic books concerning the end-times, especially in the Book of Revelation. This documentary will bring complete clarity to what is referred to as the ‘Mark of the Beast,’ all while debunking the many myths surrounding it. Could it be that this marking is something other than a computer chip?</p>
<p>Light will be shed on the dangers of the mistranslation of vitally key Scriptures within the New Testament that caused the Church, as well as society, to erroneously worship on certain days while inadvertently ignoring others.</p>
<p>In our first documentary project, The Calendar Story: Understanding Heaven's Time-Clock, you will learn the intricacies of our Creator's reckoning of time, and how man has altered it over that last 1,700 years. It will teach you what He expects and when He expects it. It will connect those missing pieces in Scripture that's been mistranslated by many and are quite difficult to understand for most.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Could it be that we have misinterpreted important lessons from the Bible? And as a result, were the teachings of Messiah somehow been changed or edited incorrectly over the years?</p>
<p>My name is Osmundo, Co-Founder and President of TruthTable Ministries, and as a teacher and minister, myself, I want to share the disturbing truth that I've discovered by in-depth study of the Scriptures over the past 15 years. Our ministry has been zealous in sharing this information with those around us, yet, we know that the world needs to hear this, and as soon as possible.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We hope to raise at least $22,000. These funds will cover the cost of equipment, filming, editing, talent, settings, transportation, and all the hundreds of things needed to produce a well-made documentary. We have broken the listing of costs down and this is a fairly accurate amount.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As you might guess, when we learned that the teachings of modern Christianity were not the same as what the original writers had instructed, we were shocked! After all, we were taught the same as you, all (or most of) our lives.</p>
<p>This documentary will shed light on these ancient secrets, and could very well bring life and excitement back into the Body of Messiah as it was in the days of old.</p>
<p>Just imagine what it would be like to have 3,000 people come into the knowledge of truth in one day? Yet, we see this take place in the Book of Acts.</p>
<p>This groundbreaking information will impact the homeschool community, public school systems, colleges and universities, seminary schools, the religious sect, and those who are interested in history and astronomy.</p>
<p>This revealing of the correct information will help the world understand the exact nature of a loving God, and those things that He expects us to do. Your assistance is needed for us to get this message out there, and this documentary is a way for us to do so.</p>
<p>In this fundraiser, we hope to raise the funds to complete the production of the documentary film entitled, “The Calendar Story: Understanding Heaven's Time-Clock”.</p>

Sadly, however, this genius stays undiscovered in most people due to lack of educational resources and their costly nature.</p><p>Statistics given by the U.S. Department of Education and the National Institute of Literacy suggest that 32 million adults in the U.S. can’t read. According to Huffington post, that’s 14 percent of the population. 21 percent of adults in the U.S. read below a 5th grade level, and 19 percent of high school graduates can’t read. The current literacy rate isn’t any better than it was 10 years ago. According to the National Assessment of Adult Literacy (completed most recently in 2003, and before that, in 1992), 14 percent of adult Americans demonstrated a “below basic” literacy level in 2003, and 29 percent exhibited a “basic” reading level.</p><p>The situation, although depressing, isn’t hopeless. Thanks to individuals such as Yuriy Seretskiy who are willing to devote their life for funding the education of those who don’t have an access to education.</p><p>His aim is to see free, or government-subsidized higher education. However, since an application for such an arrangement is difficult to launch without considerable delays, this campaign has been established to fulfil the ambitions of Yuriy and provide finance for students who might otherwise miss out of the opportunity of education. And he requires your help to make this possible! Your funds will be used for the following:</p><ul>
<li>Fund at least 100 individual student scholarships</li>
<li>Provide students with upkeep funds for their day-to-day living for the duration of their study.</li>
</ul><p>Even though your funds are for an excellent humanitarian cause, however, we won’t let you by empty handed. There are specific perks with specific amounts making this campaign a win win situation for whoever is linked with it!</p><p>The Perks are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>For $25  USD</strong></li></ul><ul>
<li>The first 25 000 people who support this campaign will get 50% discount on $50 perk.</li>
<li>World Record Participation: Are you a fan of Anastasia Kvitko? Do you want to be part of a world record? Millions of people will see your picture, this is a unique, once in a lifetime chance to be part of a crazy world record, and the bigger we go the tougher it is for someone to beat it!</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>For $50  USD</strong></li></ul><ul><li>For any fan of Anastasia having exclusive content, photos and video is priceless. A closed group with limited VIP access only will be created where this exclusive information will be accessible. With photos, videos, competitions and opportunities to meet this superstar access to the Facebook group is well worth $50.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>For $10000  USD</strong></li></ul><ul><li>The Ultra Perk costs $10,000. For $10K you will be entered into the world record mosaic and you will get access to the closed face book group but your $10,000 also buys you a ticket to a closed after party celebrating the success of this campaign. Anastasia and many other special guests will be in attendance and this will be the best party of 2017.</li></ul><p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">Please fund our campaign for a small chunk of your fortune can lead to the discovery of a cure for cancer by some genius who, as yet, doesn’t have access to quality education. </p><p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">Thank you!</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>Yuriy Seretskiy was born in the former Soviet Union into a family of doctors. He grew up fully understanding of the value of education. He knows why it is so important for a person to have the best education possible regardless of personal, political or financial circumstances. Yuriy understands and believes that education is the foundation stone for future successful lives. From a young age, his dream has always been to help hundreds of students to go to college and study. He dreams of seeing others harness their skills and talents and put them to work. He is not afraid to say that he believes these students have the potential to win a Nobel Prize, solve world hunger or even find a lasting cure for cancer or maybe AIDS in the not-so-distant future. It is all possible when the right people are given the right education with no boundaries.</p><p>When Yuriy ran for US Congress in 2016, he ran to make his dream a reality. He wanted and still wants to see free or government-subsidized higher education. Action will always speak louder than words and the fact that everything he does is in order to improve this country exemplifies this. This campaign has been established to fulfil the ambitions of Yuriy and provide finance for students who might otherwise miss out of the opportunity of education.</p><p>Every day new talent is discovered and uncovered. Bright sparks and future superstars are regularly emerging at all levels of society with uncanny professionals drawing the public’s attention to the achievements or potential. While thousands of talented individuals shine, each day there is an equal or greater number that are never noticed. These one of a kind, unique and hidden talents go unnoticed, untapped and untrained leaving the world poorer. The lucky ones are found they get given a chance but for many there is little or no hope of this. The talent is walking among us, frustrated and confused dreaming, wishing that somehow they could be seen or get to a place of education where they can show off their ability.</p><p>We are trying to find creative ways to make this funding come to life. Your participation will enable us to accomplish the following:</p><ul>
<li>Fund at least 100 individual student scholarships</li>
<li>Provide students with upkeep funds for their day-to-day living for the duration of their study.</li>
</ul><p>What would the world look like if education was within the reach of those less fortunate?</p><p><strong>50% to start the ball rolling</strong></p><p>To grab your attention the first 25 000 people who support this campaign will get 50% discount on the perks.  This means the $50 incentive will be $25  (limited to 25 000 people) and the crazy $10,000 will be $5,000 (limited to 1000 people)</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>Now we have your attention read on</u></strong></p><p><strong>The Goal</strong></p><p>The goal of this campaign is to provide scholarships to those in need of funding for their tuition and a target of $2.75 million has been set to achieve this. Candidates will be selected based in strict criteria with their financial circumstances being at the top of the list.

Sadly, however, this genius stays undiscovered in most people due to lack of educational resources and their costly nature.Statistics given by the U.S. Department of Education and the National Institute of Literacy suggest that 32 million adults in the U.S. can’t read. According to Huffington post, that’s 14 percent of the population. 21 percent of adults in the U.S. read below a 5th grade level, and 19 percent of high school graduates can’t read. The current literacy rate isn’t any better than it was 10 years ago. According to the National Assessment of Adult Literacy (completed most recently in 2003, and before that, in 1992), 14 percent of adult Americans demonstrated a “below basic” literacy level in 2003, and 29 percent exhibited a “basic” reading level.The situation, although depressing, isn’t hopeless. Thanks to individuals such as Yuriy Seretskiy who are willing to devote their life for funding the education of those who don’t have an access to education.His aim is to see free, or government-subsidized higher education. However, since an application for such an arrangement is difficult to launch without considerable delays, this campaign has been established to fulfil the ambitions of Yuriy and provide finance for students who might otherwise miss out of the opportunity of education. And he requires your help to make this possible! Your funds will be used for the following:
Fund at least 100 individual student scholarships
Provide students with upkeep funds for their day-to-day living for the duration of their study.
Even though your funds are for an excellent humanitarian cause, however, we won’t let you by empty handed. There are specific perks with specific amounts making this campaign a win win situation for whoever is linked with it!The Perks are as follows:For $25  USD

He grew up fully understanding of the value of education. He knows why it is so important for a person to have the best education possible regardless of personal, political or financial circumstances. Yuriy understands and believes that education is the foundation stone for future successful lives. From a young age, his dream has always been to help hundreds of students to go to college and study. He dreams of seeing others harness their skills and talents and put them to work. He is not afraid to say that he believes these students have the potential to win a Nobel Prize, solve world hunger or even find a lasting cure for cancer or maybe AIDS in the not-so-distant future. It is all possible when the right people are given the right education with no boundaries.When Yuriy ran for US Congress in 2016, he ran to make his dream a reality. He wanted and still wants to see free or government-subsidized higher education. Action will always speak louder than words and the fact that everything he does is in order to improve this country exemplifies this. This campaign has been established to fulfil the ambitions of Yuriy and provide finance for students who might otherwise miss out of the opportunity of education.Every day new talent is discovered and uncovered. Bright sparks and future superstars are regularly emerging at all levels of society with uncanny professionals drawing the public’s attention to the achievements or potential. While thousands of talented individuals shine, each day there is an equal or greater number that are never noticed. These one of a kind, unique and hidden talents go unnoticed, untapped and untrained leaving the world poorer. The lucky ones are found they get given a chance but for many there is little or no hope of this. The talent is walking among us, frustrated and confused dreaming, wishing that somehow they could be seen or get to a place of education where they can show off their ability.We are trying to find creative ways to make this funding come to life. Your participation will enable us to accomplish the following:
Fund at least 100 individual student scholarships
Provide students with upkeep funds for their day-to-day living for the duration of their study.

That’s why you often see referral contests announced on campaign pages throughout Indiegogo. We want to make sure that your efforts are recognized whenever you participate and here’s what you need to do to make your action count:How can I be sure that my referrals count?Simply log in to Indiegogo if you have not already, or create an account by signing up here. Then, visit the campaign page on Indiegogo and look to the right of the main video for the ""Link"" button. Click the ""Link"" button. You will then see a popup with your unique link. Copy your unique share URL and use your unique URL to share the campaign on social media, email your friends and contacts, write a blog post, etc.*This is an example. Here the URL shows a unique number ('12405055') on the end. This URL will be different for you, based on the campaign you are sharing, and your Unique ID will be different since it's your Unique ID.Please Note: Due to Indiegogo's privacy policy, the campaigner will ONLY receive the name and email address of people who back their campaign. If you are not a backer, the campaign owner will not be able to get in touch with you should you win their referral contest.You may want to consider backing their campaign before participating in a referral contest to ensure the campaigner will be able to contact you. How To Track Your Results
Log into your Indiegogo account.
Click on your user name beside the search box at the top right of the page.
Select the “My Profile” option.
Click on the tab that says “Referrals” for the latest totals of referrals and contributions.

If you tell your friends by word of mouth or send a link without your unique referral ID, that share will NOT be counted in your referrals on Indiegogo. You can use your Indiegogo profile to track your referrals on each campaign you’ve shared. This makes it easy to participate in more than one referral contest at once! FAQs

All you have to do is share!NB: We will only give it away if we raise the full amount of $2.75 Million In SummaryImagine how much better our country would be with thousands of these neglected individuals being refined, trained and eventually released into society after they have been through quality education. Consider the levels of advancement it will bring to many facets of society. Potential professionals and stars are all their, hiding among us, sat next to us on the bus or walking with us on the sidewalk. Imagine if this talent could be found and given the opportunity to excel. This is what the scholarships provided through this campaign are set to do: find, refine and release.We need every concerned person to contribute his or her quota for this campaign to succeed. Your participation will play its part in providing those we support with the tuition assistance they need for a better tomorrow. Funds raised will go directly towards providing these scholarship opportunities, with strict accounting and transparent reporting. The automatic 10% of funds raised as a fee has been accounted for. Yuriy has started the ball rolling with a personal investment of $200,000 to purchase the two prizes that make this campaign unique. Every referral makes a difference, and every referral improves your chances of winning a Porsche Boxster. It costs nothing to share this and we are looking to raise at least $2.75 Million to change the lives of others.This is one of Yuriys big philanthropic events for 2017 and your support is welcomed. Raising $2.75 Million is not easy but with many people each playing a small part it is more than achievable. After fees paid to Indiegogo $2.5 million will remain and this money will be spent in education.Please, use your social might! Tweet about us, like us on Facebook, or write a blog post!Word of mouth publicity is also equally effective.Just talking about and sharing the link with friends, family and co-workers will jumpstart this campaign and ensure its success.Thank youOn behalf of Yuriy Seretskiy, Anastasia Kvitko and the students who will benefit from your kind support we say thank you. Without you this campaign cannot be a success and without you the students we help will never have the chance to shine.",5.0,3,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Hi, we're Design Dance.</h3>
<p>We’re an arts education company on a mission to build a stronger, more empathetic world through dance education.  Since our founding in 2008, we’ve reached thousands of Chicago kids, teaching courage, connection, and self-awareness through dance programs during the school day or after-school. Our community of forward-thinking parents and school leadership has grown to serve over 1300 students through over 100 classes per week.  We’re known for our innovative approach to non-traditional education experiences and are proud to have received the prestigious Creative Schools Grant for the past three consecutive years for our in-school residencies.</p>
<h3>The Acceptance Tour</h3>
<p>The Acceptance Tour is a Design Dance initiative aimed at bringing our empathy building Poetry in Motion program to kids in Chicago, Austin, and LA through a weekend arts experience for kids ages 9-17.  We’ll offer two days of programming for kids that will focus on the theme of self-acceptance.  Our team of professional poetry teachers, dancers, and yoga instructors will travel to community spaces to help kids develop habits that build self-acceptance and acceptance of others.  </p>
<p><strong>Day 1: Family Yoga</strong></p>
<p>Families enjoy snacks, drinks, and a yoga class! We'll stretch, balance, and relax as a community.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2: Acceptance Day</strong></p>
<p>A full day of workshops culminating in a community performance. Our day will begin with a discussion and exploration of qualities and intention setting, followed by yoga and meditation. Students will work with our Poetry instructor to create a written piece on the topic of Acceptance. After lunch, students will meet our Professional Dance Instructor who will teach choreographic foundations and then lead students through the process of turning their writing into an original dance. By focusing on self and group exploration, students will gain confidence, courage, and self-awareness leading up to their final performance for friends, family and the community.</p>
<p><strong>Day 3: The Art of Self-Acceptance: How to Love Yourself While Growing Your Career</strong></p>
<p>For the 21+ crowd! Join us for an intimate conversation about the delicate balance between self-acceptance and career growth, moderated by Design Dance Founder/Director Debra Giunta. We'll enjoy food and cocktails while sharing ways to better encourage a healthy self-image as changemakers and entrepreneurs in our local communities. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're working hard to put an amazing weekend together for our students and we need your support! Our goal is to raise $5,500 in the next 30 days in order to provide these weekends free of charge to our students. We’ll need to cover travel expenses, speakers, teachers, and supplies for up to 200 students. </p>
<p>When you support the Design Dance Acceptance Tour, you are helping provide experiences for students that strengthen their confidence, encourages their creativity, and empowers their agency. In return, we also have some wonderful perks for you from custom thank you cards using photos taken from Acceptance Tour stops, Design Dance t-shirts, documentary credits, and even an opportunity for you to bring the Design Dance Acceptance Tour to your town next year!</p>
<h3>Did you say Documentary?</h3>
<p>Yes! During the Acceptance Tour 2017, we will be filming interviews with students, instructors, speakers, teachers, parents, and community partners, as well as integrate footage from workshops and performances, to create a mini-documentary unpacking what acceptance means for youth and what we can do as a community to create a healthy and supportive environment for them.</p>
<h3>Why do we believe in Arts Education?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Students who study art are 4 times more likely to be recognized for academic achievement and 3 times more likely to be awarded for school attendance than students who do not.</li>
<li>The American public, by an overwhelming margin, believes the arts are vital to a well-rounded education; more than half rate the importance of arts education a “ten” on a scale of one to ten.</li>
<li>Anxiety disorders affect one in eight children. Anxiety disorders also often co-occur with other disorders such as depression, eating disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies show that physical activity decreases anxiety, stress and teaches children healthy coping methods when they do face these struggles.</li>
<li>Recent dropout rates for American high schools are nearing 30% as schools struggle to engage students in curriculum. Involving students in their education by giving them creative autonomy prepares them to take ownership in other core subject areas, improving student desires to stay in school</li>
</ul> <h3>Why do we believe in the Acceptance Tour?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Acceptance Tour brings the benefits of arts education to students in major cities free of charge.</li>
<li>In addition to learning avenues for healthy self-expression, students improve literacy, reading comprehension, stress coping methods and other life skills vital to succeeding in their future endeavors.</li>
<li>Each student leaves the Acceptance Tour with improved team building skills and confidence as they collaborate to create original poems and dances to share with their families and school community.  </li>

students with a unique, state-of-the-art environment and give them the opportunity to express their talents. These studios will properly equip our classrooms for new, enriching, and accessible arts education programs for children and adults alike. Arts and music education is a growing force in the Southwest Florida community.

Additionally, owning a STUDIOBRICKS system provides an added service to the Sidney & Berne Davis Art Center as a resource for visiting musicians and vocalists for warm-ups and rehearsals, as well as Southwest Florida residents looking for their own rehearsal space. 

The Plan
The more money we raise for our Learning Studios, the more we can fulfill our mission. 
100% of the proceeds from this campaign will be donated toward the purchase of new STUDIOBRICKS Learning Studios and the renovation and completion of our upstairs classrooms.
By providing a place for new music creation, and excellence by giving the community a space to develop new talents, these studios will help us nurture arts innovation.
We can’t do this alone - We need your help! 

Donate today to make these Learning studios and education programs a reality! Help us create spaces where creativity and passion come alive!


The Perks
We will be offering perk options to the campaign as a way to give back to all of you who have supported and continue to support us during the growth of the Art Center.

Jack, 8th Grader: "" Technology motivates me to get my schoolwork done.  I can't imagine a world without technology.  It's everywhere!""
Nicholas, 8th Grader: ""On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the most important, teaching students to use technology is a 10.  I can't think of any career or job in my future that will not be using technology.""
Ethan, 8th Grader: ""Schools should let us use technology because the world is using tech more and more every day.""
Lucy, 5th Grader: ""I don't get to use technology at school.  I have to ask my brother to show me how to use it when I get home.""


Do parents think it is important to teach with technology in school? 
Here's what Dom, Lindy and Claire had to say...


Dom: “My job here on Maui requires that I connect with people on the mainland on a daily basis through technology.  It is extremely important to me that my kids learn how to use technology in school so they’ll have the skills to succeed in the real world.”
Lindy: ""Technology is the top of the list of important subjects. If you are not teaching technology in the schools where are kids going to learn how to use it?  They are learning from You Tube and social media.  Are they learning the things they really need to know?  I don’t think so.  I would hope it would come from the classroom.""
Claire: ""In 6th grade, my son worked on a 3-month long Science project and used technology every day.  The students felt they were in charge.  They were creating presentations, videos, doing research and collaborating with each other. It was such a great experience and they used great tools.  Just like in the workforce where people are working in teams, working on projects together.  Teaching these life skills and modeling the real world of work is exactly what schools and teachers need to be having kids do.""
   
Why do we need this money? Ednexio currently has the framework that allows students to personalize their learning, but we need your help to create high quality, technology infused lessons that will be available for all to use in the Shared Library.  
Teachers currently have the ability to create their own lessons inside Ednexio.  Just imagine if teachers were able to share their ednexio lessons with each other and, beyond that, were able to customize any lesson to fit the needs of their students! Teachers would have instant access to pre-screened lessons for all standards, grades, and subject areas - English Language Arts, Math, Science, History Social Science, Technology, Visual and Performing Arts.  
Students would have access to all of these lessons, without having to wait for their teachers to create every lesson themselves.  Imagine the possibilities if students could benefit from the knowledge and expertise of not only their teacher, but teachers around the world.  Teachers would be able to collaborate and keep their students engaged and excited to learn every day!
We need $100,000 to build 2500 interactive, teacher-created lessons for grades Kindergarten through 8th for our Shared Library.  Your support will help students experience cutting edge, personalized learning at a much faster rate than would otherwise be possible.


Other Ways You Can Help - Spread the Word! 
It's time classrooms evolve from a one-size-fits-all model to one of personalized learning enhanced by technology.  Join us in our mission to change the classroom into a place that engages students to learn through technology; a place that excites students and encourages creativity, collaboration and problem-solving; and a place that empowers students by teaching them the skills to succeed now and in the future.  
Whether you contribute to our campaign or not, you can help us by:


encouraging teachers and principals you may know to use Ednexio.
discussing the benefits of Ednexio for both students and teachers at your next PTC/PTA meeting .
urging your school to become innovative and use Ednexio in their classrooms.
spreading the word about Ednexio on Facebook, Twitter, email, and through face-to-face conversations.

PerksWe want teachers to have the means to experiment with and use Ednexio on a daily basis.   When a teacher signs up for an Ednexio account, we provide them with ""free trial"" credits to assign lessons to their students.  Before they spend their credits and assign lessons, they are able to explore all the features of Ednexio. Once they use up their free credits, they must purchase additional credits to continue to assign lessons to their students.   Our perks allow you to:
buy gift coupons for a  student, teacher, or a school you may know.  
sponsor a lesson.  Is there something you enjoyed learning when you were in school?  Share your idea with us and we'll create a lesson for the Shared Library.  Your name will appear on the lesson as a sponsor.
become a Bronze, Silver or Gold sponsor.  Your name or logo will appear on our website.
become an angel sponsor.  You know you want to help personalize learning, but you're not sure what ""perk"" you want to contribute to.  No worries!  We'll put your angel contribution where it's needed most.  Your name will appear on our website.
donate as a ""Mover and Shaker.""  Your name or company will appear on our website.",2.0,1,"1 Campaign

</p>
<h2>Problem </h2>
<p></p>

Around the world, multinational mining companies threaten indigenous lands, communities, and cultures.  The insatiable hunger for gold, silver and other minerals--and the vast profits that they bring--has cut majestic mountains down to nubs, turned pristine lakes into lesions, poisoned pure waters, and caused grave health harms from toxic chemicals used in processing ore. <br/>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445187500/d04atpe5jf8xem87njaq.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 660.337px; height: 442px;""/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">But more and more, communities are standing up and saying ""No!"" to the ongoing plunder of their territories by mining companies.  Community defenders and anti-mining activists are not only organizing within their communities, they are forming regional alliances with other mining affected and at-risk communities. Increasingly, they understand that the unimaginable damage wrought by mines, is not a local problem--it is systemic and world-wide.  To effectively confront mining companies and hold them accountable, the struggle must be taken to the international level.  And the strength that comes from unity is critical in confronting the global problem of predatory mining for profit, at the grave expense of people and the natural world.</span></p>

<h2><b>Response</b></h2>
<p>So we--a coalition of human and environmental rights organizations from México, Thailand, Canada and the U.S.--have created a space for activists and community defenders from mining impacted communities around the world to come together, share stories of their struggles, weave new relationships and networks of solidarity and explore ways of working together to protect Mother Earth, their communities, and cultures.  <b>Delegates from Thailand, U.S. Native Americans, and Canadian First Nations indigenous peoples will come together in November to meet with three mining affected Zapotec communities in Oaxaca, México.</b></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This unique delegation, forum and festival will:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">put individual community struggles in the international spotlight, while highlighting the commonality of each peoples' experience with destructive mining projects.  </span><br/>
</li>
<li>foster effective networks of solidarity between mining affected communities around the world.</li>
<li>offer community defenders and activists opportunities to develop strategies for working collectively to hold mining companies and governments accountable.</li>
<li>increase public awareness of the devastating environmental, cultural, community and health harms that inevitably come with extractive mining projects.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2><b>Here is What we Need</b></h2>We are raising $5,000 to cover remaining costs for the facilitation of the delegation (Oct 30 - Nov 11), and the forum and festival (Nov 12).  We have already raised funds via personal donations, grants, and coordinated a separate <a href=""http://igg.me/at/SUPPORTCOMMUNITYRIGHTS/x/911747"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiegogo Campaign</a> to raise funds to cover the airfare and participation costs for our Thai delegates, but we are still in need of additional funding to ensure this campaign is successful.<br/><br/><p>Specifically, the $5,000 will go to cover the following:</p>
<p>1.)  The costs of professional interpretation (Spanish to English to Thai) and ensuring we have enough interpreters throughout the delegation.</p>
<p>2.) Rental costs for Interpretation equipment to be used during the ""<i><b>Yes! To Life, No! to Mining""</b></i> International forum and festival on November 12th.</p>
<p>3.) The cost of supplies and materials for a solidarity-mural the delegates will paint together at the conclusion of the trip.<br/></p>
<p>4.) Professional video documentation of the entire delegation and festival and the production of several films showcasing different aspects of the trip.<br/></p>
<p>5.) Expenses related to the participation of additional First Nations delegates from Canada and Native American delegates from the US.</p>
<p>Every dollar we raise above and beyond our $5,000 goal will be put to use enhancing the tour and festival, and will allow us to invite more participants to the forum on Nov 12th.<br/></p>

Problem 


Around the world, multinational mining companies threaten indigenous lands, communities, and cultures.  The insatiable hunger for gold, silver and other minerals--and the vast profits that they bring--has cut majestic mountains down to nubs, turned pristine lakes into lesions, poisoned pure waters, and caused grave health harms from toxic chemicals used in processing ore. 



But more and more, communities are standing up and saying ""No!"" to the ongoing plunder of their territories by mining companies.  Community defenders and anti-mining activists are not only organizing within their communities, they are forming regional alliances with other mining affected and at-risk communities. Increasingly, they understand that the unimaginable damage wrought by mines, is not a local problem--it is systemic and world-wide.  To effectively confront mining companies and hold them accountable, the struggle must be taken to the international level.  And the strength that comes from unity is critical in confronting the global problem of predatory mining for profit, at the grave expense of people and the natural world.


We ask for clean air, fertile land. No to the mine.


Anti-mining protest in San José del Progreso, Oaxaca, México
Response
So we--a coalition of human and environmental rights organizations from México, Thailand, Canada and the U.S.--have created a space for activists and community defenders from mining impacted communities around the world to come together, share stories of their struggles, weave new relationships and networks of solidarity and explore ways of working together to protect Mother Earth, their communities, and cultures.  Delegates from Thailand, U.S. Native Americans, and Canadian First Nations indigenous peoples will come together in November to meet with three mining affected Zapotec communities in Oaxaca, México.
This unique delegation, forum and festival will:


put individual community struggles in the international spotlight, while highlighting the commonality of each peoples' experience with destructive mining projects.  

foster effective networks of solidarity between mining affected communities around the world.
offer community defenders and activists opportunities to develop strategies for working collectively to hold mining companies and governments accountable.
increase public awareness of the devastating environmental, cultural, community and health harms that inevitably come with extractive mining projects.


Here is What we NeedWe are raising $5,000 to cover remaining costs for the facilitation of the delegation (Oct 30 - Nov 11), and the forum and festival (Nov 12).  We have already raised funds via personal donations, grants, and coordinated a separate Indiegogo Campaign to raise funds to cover the airfare and participation costs for our Thai delegates, but we are still in need of additional funding to ensure this campaign is successful.Specifically, the $5,000 will go to cover the following:
1.)  The costs of professional interpretation (Spanish to English to Thai) and ensuring we have enough interpreters throughout the delegation.
2.) Rental costs for Interpretation equipment to be used during the ""Yes! To Life, No! to Mining"" International forum and festival on November 12th.
3.) The cost of supplies and materials for a solidarity-mural the delegates will paint together at the conclusion of the trip.
4.) Professional video documentation of the entire delegation and festival and the production of several films showcasing different aspects of the trip.
5.) Expenses related to the participation of additional First Nations delegates from Canada and Native American delegates from the US.
Every dollar we raise above and beyond our $5,000 goal will be put to use enhancing the tour and festival, and will allow us to invite more participants to the forum on Nov 12th.

<p>The economic changes that took over in Morocco during the last 15 years have helped to create a reverse process of migration.</p>
<p>Many friends of mine have decided to leave Italy and return to Morocco driven by the desire to build a future in a country that is very promising thanks to social  and economic reforms, investments made during the last decade and more and more foreign investors coming for business.</p>
<p>Through repeated trips I have seen with my eyes this changing-fast process.</p>
<p>In June 2014 I started to think about a long-term photographic project that was intended to show the country's economic and social development.</p>
<p>I started to photograph the first chapter in August 2014: a major investment ( $60 Billion) who's purpose is to deal with the population growth through the construction of satellite towns located near the almost saturated suburbs of larger cities.  Currently these new cities are predominantly inhabited by that part of the population that once lived on those lands; the idea is to convince the newly born middle class to buy houses and open new business in order to avoid the construction of dormitory-towns.                                                                                                    </p>

</div></div>","From the series ""Satellite Cities""

Since its independence in 1956 Morocco has been involved in developing a democratic society and open market economy based on the rule of law.  Starting from the rise to the throne of Mohammed VI in 1999, Morocco has grown steadily, increasing its economic stability, reducing unemployment and developing more and more business.

Economic growth, which has led to an increase in jobs, has allowed partly to slow down emigration and improve exports. The result is of a solid position in the African context and a more and more destination country for foreign investors.""

                                                      From the series ""Satellite Cities""



The economic changes that took over in Morocco during the last 15 years have helped to create a reverse process of migration.
Many friends of mine have decided to leave Italy and return to Morocco driven by the desire to build a future in a country that is very promising thanks to social  and economic reforms, investments made during the last decade and more and more foreign investors coming for business.
Through repeated trips I have seen with my eyes this changing-fast process.
In June 2014 I started to think about a long-term photographic project that was intended to show the country's economic and social development.
I started to photograph the first chapter in August 2014: a major investment ( $60 Billion) who's purpose is to deal with the population growth through the construction of satellite towns located near the almost saturated suburbs of larger cities.  Currently these new cities are predominantly inhabited by that part of the population that once lived on those lands; the idea is to convince the newly born middle class to buy houses and open new business in order to avoid the construction of dormitory-towns.                                                                                                    


                                                          From the series ""Satellite Cities""                                                          From the series ""Satellite Cities""                                                              From the series ""Satellite Cities""I have later decided  to launch this campaign in order to be able to collect the money needed to continue this story.
With your help I will support myself in Morocco until mid/end of March 2016 and devote the next chapters of ""A NOUVELLE IDENTITè"" to other economic investments promoted by the government.
I will spend 10 days in Tangier and with the help of a fixer I will photograph the newly born port ""TANGER MED"" which is having  an important economic and social effect within it's region, Tangier-Tetuan is actually  the closest  region to Europe for commerce.  The complex is getting ready to become one of the most important in the world thanks to it's 2.5 million TEU ( Twenty-foot equivalent unit) traffic in 2013, an extension project called Tanger Med II that aims to reach 8.2 million containers and a free trade area named Tanger Free Zone that helps more than 500 international companies to relocate their production  in a high potential development area.                                       
I will then move in the souther regions of Morocco and  photograph the $ 13 billion investment in renewable energy. The construction of wind and solar farms is to ensure that the country reaches the target to source 42% of energy by 2020. In fact, until 2011 Morocco was importing 95% of electricity with serious impact on the state budget.  Once achieved, the government  plan will be to start exporting the energy.  My photography will mainly focus on the positive effects that this investment is having on the population of rural areas of the southern regions.Many other investments are on the way: the industrial development of the oriental regions and the investment whose purpose is to strengthen the Sahara region.

A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME: 
I was born in 1990 in Lucca, Italy. After my studies in Graphic and Advertising, I firstly worked as a staff photographer for a local newspaper and after did a photojournalism course at Istituto Marangoni in Florence held by Terraproject Collective (Simone Donati and Michele Borzoni).
I’m presently living in Berlin and dedicating my time to Photography.
My long term  project ""UNA NOUVELLE IDENTITè ""Satellite cities"" was recently awarded as finalist of the prestigious ""Portfolio Italia 2015"" event.
                   
           (Myself working in Tamansourt, Marrakech, sept 2014)
                                                             
                                                                     €1800 GOAL

From the  € 1800 goal I'm going to use  €600 for rewards and fees. With the  rest I will cover the whole trip:  return flight from Berlin (or Pisa) to Fez  ( approximately Feb - mid March), Hotel when needed, Fixer, Car,food to survive and the time needed for the editing of the work done.

If we were foxes we'd look something like this :)We’re passionate about GitLab. It is a powerful instrument, and GitLab CI is one of its most impressive parts.We see that many developers underestimate the effects of automation. They keep wasting their time and energy on the same routine tasks every day. Instead, they could invest some efforts in automation and delegate the most of the routine to GitLab CI!We creating this course because we believe thatRobots Should Be Busy! Not humans (or foxes)!For most beginners, it is hard to learn by reading the documentation. The documentation is comprehensive, but it is not what they need.For a beginner, it is easier to grasp new concepts when they learn them step by step in the form of a story. When there is a story, you do not only understand “Hows,” you also learn “Why-s,” which is even more important!This course will be a set of short stories about a team developing a product, meeting real-world and not so real-world challenges and overcoming them with the help of GitLab CI.The course will have three levels(see full plan draft at the bottom of the page): 
GitLab CI basics
Becoming a Pro
Advanced Level
The more support we get, the more advanced topics we’ll add to the course!!By now, we’re at the end of the planning stage, and ready to start creating!What We Need & What You GetWe’re going to create this course no matter what! However, more advanced topics require additional research, so your support is very important for us!We're about to make around 20 illustrated lessons, record at least 10 screencasts, and prepare a homework for every important concept.We also want to give our supporters something special, so we’re preparing not only digital perks, but also physical. Check them out. You'll find there:
GitLab Fan sticker packs 
GitLab Fan t-shirts with the course logo
Printed cards with picked GitLab principles
(pictures will be posted here soon :)The ImpactWe believe it is important to teach beginner developers about the concept of Continuous Integration. It can save so much time and make them happier by allowing them to work more on creative tasks instead of routine.We also believe that GitLab CI is a perfect fit for that goal. 
It has clean semantics and concise syntax
It is technology-agnostic so that you can use it with any programming language of choice
It is integrated into GitLab, so it requires less integration and configuration than other CI tools
If we reach the goal of $8000, we will also create a separate course for beginners about the flow of work in GitLab and make it available for free for anyone!We’ve been running GitLabFan.com for more than six months. Now we want to move our project to the next level and create something more impactful! Please join  can help us with that!Risks & ChallengesFinding a good way to teach is always a challenge. Finding a good metaphor for a concept, finding a good example to demonstrate the usefulness of an approach, drawing an illustration - it all requires time and concentration. Sometimes you have to re-work your materials for two-three times until you finally become satisfied with it.But we love this kind of challenges, and the final result is the best motivation! Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you’re already an expert in GitLab CI, and don't need an access to the class, you can still help us:
Choose one of the perks without class admission!
Buy class admission for a friend as a present!
Spread the word about this course across your friends!

<b><br/><br/>Short Summary:<br/></b><p>
</p><p>How many students try to learn to play the
piano, but are discouraged by the tedium and frustration of trying to read
sheet music? What if there was a way to return music to its roots?  To
make it accessible to all children around the world?</p>
<span></span><p>My name is Hellene Hiner. I am a musicologist and a music teacher. <br/></p><p>After gaining a Master's degree in musicology, I set out on a personal journey to find solutions to the biggest impediments of music education today, in particular the challenges students encounter with sight-reading the Grand Staff.  <br/></p><p><b>The Problem identified:</b></p><p><b></b></p>Along the way, I stumbled on the answer and it is something we have known for more than 1000 years. In the days of simple choirs and solo, a Benedictine monk named Guido created a way to notate music, and this method became very 
popular.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448300735/ab5c9igvea9lsajdqe59.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 312px; height: 312px;""/>      <br/></p><p> It was adopted as the universal way to write music so that 
others could sight-read songs and learn to play them.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448467562/fmxzpxpxbkechdcengmc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>And it worked very well until the creation of keyboard instruments such as the piano: the visual orientation of Guido's music notation is vertical and the visual orientation of a piano keyboard is horizontal.  <br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448553407/c7jyspfdh6pqunewjuc7.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 228.281px; height: 171px;""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448553452/pksqajooagvwucpwblxy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 230.524px; height: 103px;""/></p><br/>While the PIANO was designed as <b>the ultimate 'conversion platform'</b> for all the Western music, its invention made learning to sight-read  counter intuitive.  <br/><br/>Take a look at the picture below.

<p>¿Cuántos alumnos
quieren aprender a tocar piano, pero se desalientan por el tedio y la
frustración al querer leer hojas de música? ¿Hay otra manera para regresar la música
a sus raíces? ¿Hacerla accesible a todos los niños alrededor del mundo?</p>
<p>Mi nombre es
Hellene Hiner. Soy musicóloga y profesora de piano.</p>
<p>Después de obtener
una Maestría en musicología, me dispuse a recorrer un camino personal para
encontrar soluciones a los más grandes impedimentos para la educación musical
hoy en día, en particular los retos que encuentran los alumnos al leer a
primera vista el Gran Pentagrama.</p>
<p><b>Problema
identificado:</b></p>
<p>A lo largo del
camino, me tropecé con la respuesta y es algo que hemos sabido hace más de 1000
años. En los tiempos de los sencillos coros y solistas, un monje benedictino
llamado Guido, creó una manera para escribir música y este método se hizo muy
popular. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448801802/t5uasy7rffrumln49usv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Fue adoptado como la manera universal para escribir música y así hacer
posible que se pudieran leer canciones y tocarlas.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448801849/joawad8s6ybt1p91vwvh.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 294.259px; height: 169px;""/></p><br/>
<p>Y funcionó muy
bien hasta la creación de instrumentos de teclado como el piano: la orientación
visual de la notación musical de Guido es vertical y la orientación visual del
teclado del piano es horizontal.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448801943/uqngxykwgkjjlrqf2yqn.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 308px; height: 231px;""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448801983/iqqdxc2efx9z8qvjzesy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 308px; height: 231px;""/><br/></p><p>Mientras el
piano fue diseñado como la principal ´plataforma de conversión´ para la música
de occidente, su invención hizo que aprender a leer la música fuera intuitivo. 

</p><p>Solamente miren la
siguiente ilustración. Si giramos el Gran Pentagrama 90 grados según las
manecillas del reloj, podremos ver que las teclas del piano son extensiones
visuales de las líneas y espacios del Gran Pentagrama.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448802041/guuqxicrz379puukwril.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 254.337px; height: 191px;""/></p><br/>
<p>Las personas que son prodigios musicales no necesitan como los principiantes,<span>  este conocimiento porque ellos pueden ver
naturalmente la relación entre las teclas y los espacios del Gran Pentagrama,
cuando la mayoría de las personas no pueden verlo.</span></p>
<p>Por lo tanto, la gran
mayoría de las personas se esfuerza y desespera aprendiendo a leer música a
primera vista.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448802117/jqac5obue4lotpw1zxzw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 338.528px; height: 267px;""/></p>
<br/>
Dominar el piano se ha vuelto una habilidad reservada para una élite (con
solidez financiera) y para los prodigios (aquellos que nacen con talento) entre
nosotros.

<p>¡ES TIEMPO DE HACER POSIBLE APRENDER PIANO Y LEER
NOTACION MUSICAL PARA LOS NIÑOS DE TODOS LOS ESTRATOS SOCIALES Y HABILIDADES!<br/>
<br/>
<b>La Solución y el Impacto del Descubrimiento</b></p>
<p>Aquí es donde
entra Soft Mozart. Hemos restaurado la música al modo en que Guido la concibió.
Hemos hecho más amigable la forma de leer notas en el Gran Pentagrama de nuevo.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fvideoseries%3Flist%3DPLA2B7E818566FF54A&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_J2EfdHe3GY%26list%3DPLA2B7E818566FF54A%26index%3D1&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F_J2EfdHe3GY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>Además, hemos
desarrollado una presentación visual del Gran Pentagrama que gradualmente lleva
al alumno de una presentación elemental de las notas musicales (de forma
horizontal) al Gran Pentagrama tradicional (de forma vertical).</p>
<p>Hacemos esto de
la misma manera en que un niño aprende a leer: De la elemental “A,”al texto
tradicional. La tecnología interactiva de la computación facilita la transición
de la presentación elemental de las notas musicales al Gran Pentagrama
tradicional.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448561905/tzxh0ycn81psafvmhphm.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 369px; height: 277px;""/></p><br/>
<p>Tanto así que
los niños pueden aprender a leer y tocar música antes de que aprendan a hablar.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448393204/vfgksgbel7fqxywtreke.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 355.644px; height: 187px;""/></p><br/>El Sistema Soft

<p><br/>
Desde la creación inicial en 2002, tenemos decenas de ganadores en competencias
de piano en Ucrania, España e Israel.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FOECcGYcQOrM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DOECcGYcQOrM&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FOECcGYcQOrM%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>La propuesta de Soft Mozart encaja perfectamente en
escuelas públicas y estudios de piano. Cada niño recibe una educación musical
de alta calidad, aprendiendo individualmente dentro de un entorno grupal.</p>
<p>Para niños con necesidades especiales, Soft Mozart es
una excelente herramienta de desarrollo. A diferencia de cualquier otra, Soft
Mozart puede motivar a este tipo de alumnos para centrarse y concentrarse,
practicar su coordinación ojo-mano y ambas, así como desarrollar su lenguaje.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448802755/isa9qr0yofmfarmfdnd1.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 429.55px; height: 287px;""/></p><br/>
<p>Soft Mozart se ha
interesado en la educación temprana. Nuestro currículo prepara bebes de hasta
24 meses para que el gusto por aprender les dure toda la vida y para que tengan éxito
académico. Utilizamos la experiencia del piano como una herramienta para
construir una sólida base para el desarrollo del niño de aprender cómo mirar y
hacer corresponder pequeños objetos a conceptos más avanzados, utilizados en
matemáticas y en ciencias.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448802821/cj4b3d8eyyg8fcurka6w.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 436px; height: 436px;""/></p><br/>

<b>Краткое содержание: <br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FeHVyQ1RpfrU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DeHVyQ1RpfrU&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FeHVyQ1RpfrU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/></b><br/>

Как много людей пробовали обучаться играть на фортепиано, но не смогли, получив взамен скучную зубрежку и разочарования? Но ведь изначально нотный текст изобретался наглядным и понятным для любого человека? Что же случилось в ходе развития музыкальной грамотности?
<br/><br/>Меня зовут Елена Хайнер. Я по специальности музыковед и учитель музыки.  
<br/><br/>После получения Диплома об окончании консерватории я начала свое индивидуальное исследование. Для нахождения основных неработающих блоков системы обучения пришлось посвятить много лет практики. Основным же предметом исследования стали сложности зрительного восприятия нотного текста, а именно Нотного Стана. 
<br/><br/><b>Идентификация проблемы:</b>
<br/><br/>В течение работы над проблемы я натолкнулась на очень интересный ответ, мимо которого прошло не одно поколение музыкальных педагогов в течение более чем 1000 лет. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448801802/t5uasy7rffrumln49usv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>Во времена создания простых одноголосных хоров и использования сольных инструментов монах – Бенедиктинец по имени Гвидо создал метод записи музыкальных звуков, который стал популярен и используется нами до сих пор.  Этот метод был принят как универсальный для записи музыкального текста, чтобы другие могли прочесть написанное и сыграть с помощью зрения, а не на слух.  
<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448801849/joawad8s6ybt1p91vwvh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>Все прекрасно работало до тех пор, пока в мир не пришли клавишные инструменты, в частности фортепиано. Зрительная ориентация для чтения музыки Гвидо оставалась вертикальной, но клавиши в свою очередь расположились горизонтально.  
<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448801943/uqngxykwgkjjlrqf2yqn.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 292px; height: 219px;""/></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448801983/iqqdxc2efx9z8qvjzesy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 293.606px; height: 220px;""/><br/>Поскольку именно КЛАВИШИ смогли взять на себя функцию основной преобразовательной платформы для многоголосной Западно-Европейской музыки, создание клавишных инструментов и в особенности фортепиано лишило обучение чтению музыкального текста интуитивной легкости, которым обладало со дня создания. <br/><br/>Взгляните на картинку ниже. Если повернуть Нотный Стан на 90 градусов по часовой стрелке, вы сможете увидеть, что клавиши являются наглядным продлением линеек и пространств Нотного Стана. <br/><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448802041/guuqxicrz379puukwril.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 421.333px; height: 316px;""/></p>Музыкально одаренные люди и профессионалы стараются увести новичков от этого знания, потому что для них более естественно опираться на слух и запоминать взаимосвязь между нотами и клавишами с помощью врожденных слуха и памяти.  <br/>Но для большинства обычных людей – это сложное и неблагодарное занятие. 

Именно поэтому большинство людей испытывает слишком много проблем, они не справляются с проблемами чтения и не способны читать нотный текст. 
Мастерство в игре на фортепиано стало прерогативой музыкально одаренной элиты (что помогает ей зарабатывать средства на жизнь) и вундеркиндов среди нас.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448802117/jqac5obue4lotpw1zxzw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 352.474px; height: 278px;""/></p><br/><br/>НАСТУПИЛО ВРЕМЯ ДАТЬ ВОЗМОЖНОСТЬ ПОЛУЧИТЬ ПОЛНОЦЕННОЕ МУЗЫКАЛЬНОЕ ОБРАЗОВАНИЕ С ПОМОЩЬЮ ФОРТЕПИАНО И ЧИТКИ НОТ С ЛИСТА ВСЕМ ДЕТЯМ НЕЗАВИСИМО ОТ ИХ ПРИРОЛНЫХ СПОСОБНОСТЕЙ ИЛИ ВОЗМОЖНЕОСТЕЙ!
<br/><br/><b>Решение проблемы и Значение Нашего Открытия
</b><br/><br/>Именно здесь на выручку приходит программа Софт Моцарт. <br/>Мы вернули музыкальную запись к тем истокам, с которых началось восхождение изобретения Гвидо Аретинского, к тому, как это было задумано изначально. <br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fw80xMHh9b7o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dw80xMHh9b7o&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fw80xMHh9b7o%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/>Мы сделали музыкальное чтение Нотного Стана дружественным для зрительного восприятия опять.  
Более того, мы разработали наглядные презентации Нотного Стана, постепенно усложняя нотную запись от Азбучной, элементарной подачи к традиционным, черно-белым горизонтальным нотам. 
<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448561905/tzxh0ycn81psafvmhphm.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 362.667px; height: 272px;""/></p><br/>Мы точно так же поступаем, когда учим детей читать: сначала с помощью Азбуки и Букваря, а потом книжек с картинками. Постепенно картинок становится меньше, а строчек письма больше. Компьютерная графика облегчает осуществление такого перехода и создает элемент интерактивности. 
<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448393204/vfgksgbel7fqxywtreke.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 380.368px; height: 200px;""/></p><br/>Это так хорошо работает, что начинающие могут учиться читать ноты и играть музыку обеими руками даже задолго до того, как учатся разговаривать!    
Система Софт Моцарт эффективно обучает любого человека от 2 до 99 лет. <br/><br/>У нас есть целый послужной список успешного применения программы в школах и домах людей в 60 странах мира. 
<br/><br/>Софт Моцарт также предлагает обучающие курсы для учителей музыки и фортепиано из различных стран мира. В настоящее время мы обучаем по <i>Английски, Русски и Испански.</i>
<br/><br/><b>ЗАСЛУГИ ПРОГРАММЫ СОФТ МОЦАРТ   

<br/></b><br/>Со времени создания системы в 2002 году у нас появились десятки победителей фортепианных конкурсов в Украине, Испании и Израиле. 
<br/><br/>Подход в обучении Софт Моцарт отлично работает в общеобразовательных школах и частных музыкальных студиях. Каждый ребенок получает музыкальное образование высочайшего качества: даже обучаясь в группе он занимается индивидуально, соревнуясь с самим собой. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448803421/uhdrq6zzsjvgq4emeouj.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 363.661px; height: 242px;""/></p><br/>Для детей с ограниченными возможностями Софт Моцарт является прекрасным инструментом для развития. Как ничто другое Софт Моцарт мотивирует детей с ограниченными возможностями, обучает их фокусироваться и держать концентрацию, улучшать их навыки зрительного, слухового и тактильного восприятия музыкального текста. Занятия с программой способствуют развитиб речи. 
<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448803490/qshjotchgw34pvin1vkp.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 447.337px; height: 252px;""/></p><br/><br/>Софт Моцарт незаменим для развития детей раннего дошкольного возраста. Наш курс обучения подготавливает малышей с 24 месяцев к жизни, в которой их ждет не только музыкальный, но и академический успех. <br/><br/>Мы используем обучение фортепиано как инструмент для построения прочного фундамента для развития ребенка: от начальных навыков умения увидеть небольшие объекты и сличать из, до более сложных понятий, необходимых в математике и других науках.  

<br/><br/>Самой важной особенностью программы Софт Моцарт является, однако, ее уникальная возможность развития самоуважения, воображения, артистичности и уверенности в собственных силах.

<p>
</p><p>Combien de personnes ont essayé d'apprendre à jouer du piano, mais ont reçu de la frustration en faisant la<span>  mémorisation ennuyeuse ?</span></p>
<p>Mais
 au départ, l'écriture musicale était claire et compréhensible pour tout
 le monde . Qu'est-il arrivé au cours de l'évolution de la musique ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Je m'appelle Helen Heiner. Je suis musicologue et professeur de musique.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Après
 avoir reçu un diplôme du Conservatoire supérieur j'ai commencé mes 
propres recherches dans la méthodologie d'apprentissage de piano . J'ai 
consacré de nombreuses années<span>  dans
 ma pratique pour trouver les principaux blocs cassés dans le système 
d'apprentissage . Le sujet principal de ma recherche était la complexité
 de la perception visuelle de la musique, précisément  - la portée.</span></p><p><br/><span><span>Identification du problème :</span></span></p><p></p><p>Pendant
 les travaux sur ce problème, je suis tombée sur une réponse très 
intéressante, qui était ignorée par beaucoup de générations de 
professeurs de musique du passé pendants plus que 1000 ans . À l'époque 
de la création de simples</p>
<p>choeurs
 à une voix et d'utilisation d'instruments solistes ,un certain moine - 
bénédictin nommé Guido mis au point une méthode d'écriture des sons 
musicaux qui est devenue très populaire et utilisée jusqu'à présent.</p>
<p>Cette
 méthode est devenue universelle pour l'écriture du texte musical pour 
permettre la lecture et l'écriture de la musique plutôt visuellement 
qu'à l'oreille . Tout a bien fonctionné jusqu'au moment d'arrivée des 
instruments à clavier. Orientation visuelle de lecture de la musique du 
système Guido reste verticale, mais les touches se retrouvent en 
position horizontale.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Puisque c'est le clavier qui<span>  pourrais
 prendre le relais de la fonction de la plateforme de réglementation 
pour la musique polyphonique d'Europe de l'ouest , la création 
d'instruments à clavier et en particulier piano a privé l'apprentissage 
de la lecture  musicale de  la facilité intuitive qu'elle possédait depuis sa mise en place.</span></p>
<p>Regardez
 la photo ci-dessous. Si vous bougez la portées de 90 degrés vers la 
droite, vous pouvez voir que les touches forment une extension claire et
 précise des espaces de la portée .</p>
<p>Les
 professionnels et les gens doués en musique essaient de détourner les 
nouveaux arrivants de cette connaissance, parce que pour eux c'est plus 
naturel de s'appuyer sur l'oreille intuitive et de mémoriser la relation
 entre les notes et les touches du clavier. Mais pour la plupart des 
gens<span>  ordinaires c'est une tâche difficile et ingrate.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>C'est pourquoi ils ressentent trop de difficultés et sont incapables de faire face aux problèmes de lecture et n'arrivent pas a<span>  lire la partition musicale .</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Malheureusement la perfection pianistique reste le privilège d'une élite musicale, des gens doués et des génies au piano .</p>
<p>
</p><p>LE TEMPS EST VENU DE DONNER<span>  À NOS ENFANTS , INDEPENDAMMENT  DE LEUR CAPACITES NATURELLES ET TALENTS,  LA POSSIBILITÉ</span></p>
<p>D'OBTENIR UNE ÉDUCATION MUSICALE COMPLÈTE À L'AIDE DE PIANO ET DE LECTURE À VUE .</p>
<p>
</p><p>La solution du problème est l'importance de notre découverte:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Et en ce moment-là précisément le programme Soft Mozart viens au secours. Nous avons retourné l'écriture musicale<span>  vers ses  racines , la d'où avais  commencé l'ascension l'invention de Guido d'Arezzo.Nous avons fait la lecture musicale de la Portée  à nouveau  amicale pour la perception visuelle .</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>En outre, nous avons développé plusieurs<span>  présentations
 visuelles de la portée , en rajoutant peu à peu les difficultés de la 
notation musicale élémentaire alphabétique et verticale vers la notation  traditionnelle horizontales avec les notes en noir et blanc.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>De la même 
manière nous enseignons aux enfants la lecture de livres : en commençant
 par l'alphabet et par la suite en lisant les livres avec des images.</p>
<p>Petit à petit la quantité des images diminue et l'écriture augmente.</p>
<p>L'Infographie facilite cette transition et crée un élément d'interactivité.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ça marche très 
bien et les petits débutants peuvent apprendre la lecture musicale et le
 jeu des mains ensemble même avant d'apprendre à parler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Le système Soft
 Mozart enseigne efficacement toute personne de 2 à 99 ans. Nous avons 
des antécédents d'utilisation réussie du programme dans les écoles et 
chez les particuliers dans 60 pays à travers le monde.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Le programme 
Soft Mozart offre également des cours de formation pour les professeurs 
de piano et de musique de différents pays du monde. Actuellement, nous 
enseignons en anglais, espagnol et russe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Les Mérites du<span>  programme SOFT MOZART  :</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>depuis la création du système en 2002 nous avons des dizaines de gagnants des concours de piano en Ukraine, Espagne et Israël.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cette approche 
dans l'enseignement Soft Mozart fonctionne très bien dans les écoles 
primaires, secondaires et les studios de musique privées. Chaque enfant 
reçoit une éducation musicale de haute qualité : même pendant ses études
 dans un groupe il travaille individuellement, en compétition avec 
soi-même .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pour les 
enfants ayant une déficience Soft Mozart est un excellent outil pour 
leur développement. Comme rien d'autre Soft Mozart motive les enfants 
handicapés , les entraîne à se concentrer et à garder la concentration, à
 améliorer leurs compétences de perception visuelle, auditive et tactile
 de la lecture musicale. Les cours avec le programme contribuent au 
développement de la parole.</p>

<p>: de la capacité initiale de voir des petits objets et de les comparer jusqu'aux<span>  concepts plus complexes nécessaires en mathématiques et autres sciences.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>La 
caractéristique la plus importante du programme Soft Mozart, toutefois,

Short Summary:
How many students try to learn to play the
piano, but are discouraged by the tedium and frustration of trying to read
sheet music? What if there was a way to return music to its roots?  To
make it accessible to all children around the world?
My name is Hellene Hiner. I am a musicologist and a music teacher. After gaining a Master's degree in musicology, I set out on a personal journey to find solutions to the biggest impediments of music education today, in particular the challenges students encounter with sight-reading the Grand Staff.  The Problem identified:Along the way, I stumbled on the answer and it is something we have known for more than 1000 years. In the days of simple choirs and solo, a Benedictine monk named Guido created a way to notate music, and this method became very 
popular.       It was adopted as the universal way to write music so that 
others could sight-read songs and learn to play them.  And it worked very well until the creation of keyboard instruments such as the piano: the visual orientation of Guido's music notation is vertical and the visual orientation of a piano keyboard is horizontal.  While the PIANO was designed as the ultimate 'conversion platform' for all the Western music, its invention made learning to sight-read  counter intuitive.  Take a look at the picture below. If you turn the Grand Staff 90 degrees clockwise, you can see that the piano keys are visual extensions of the lines and spaces of the Grand StaffMusical prodigies have led beginners astray from this knowledge because they can naturally see the relationship between the keys and the spaces of the Grand Staff while most people can't.   Therefore, the vast majority of people struggle and fall behind in learning how to sight-read music. Mastering the piano has become a skill reserved for the elite (substantial financial resources) and the prodigies (naturally gifted) among us.  IT IS TIME TO MAKE THE POSSIBILITY OF LEARNING TO PLAY PIANO AND READING MUSIC NOTATION A REALITY FOR CHILDREN OF ALL BACKGROUNDS AND ABILITIES!  The Solution and the Impact of the DiscoveryThat’s where Soft Mozart comes in. We have restored music to the way Guido first envisioned it . We have made reading the notes of the Grand Staff more eyesight friendly again. On the top of that, we have developed a visual presentation of the Grand Staff that gradually takes the student from elementary presentation of musical notes (presented horizontally) to the traditional Grand Staff (presented vertically).  We do this much in the same way children learn to read:   From elementary ""A"" to traditional text. Interactive computer technology facilitates the transition from the elementary presentation of musical notes to the traditional Grand Staff.  So much so that children can actually learn to read  and play music before the learn to speak.        The Soft Mozart system successfully teaches anyone from ages 2 to 99. We have a proven track record of success in schools and households in 60 different countries.Soft Mozart also offers a training system for music educators from different countries. Currently we provide training in English, Spanish and Russian!THE MERITS OF SOFT MOZART   Since the initial creation in 2002, we have many piano competition winners in Ukraine, Spain and Israel.The Soft Mozart approach is an excellent fit for public schools and piano studios. Each child receives a world class music education, while learning individually whether in a group setting or not.  For children with special needs, Soft Mozart is an excellent developmental tool. Unlike anything else, Soft Mozart can motivate special needs students to focus and concentrate, practice their eye-hand and both hands coordination and develop speech. Soft Mozart is must for early education. Our curriculum prepares babies as young as 24 months for life lasting enjoyment and academic success. We use the piano experience as a tool for building a solid foundation for the child’s development: from learning how to see and match small objects to more advanced concepts needed in math and science. Soft Mozart's most important feature, however, is our unique way of building the self-esteem, imagination, artistry and confidence of every child.Help us expand this dream and bring this possibility to even more children and adults everywhere.  What We Need & What You GetThe software component of this system was created 14 years ago. The impact of this invention went beyond our wildest expectations. But after this many years, it is time for a major upgrade.We need funds to1. Update the software programming to create improved graphics and functionality2. Add new songs, exercises and games to improve the learning and teaching experience3. Translate the curriculum into more languages4. Create applications for mobile devices5. Develop online training for parents, schools and self-learners  in a 12  level computer game format. 6. Hire technical support team7. Generate awarenessOur Perks.    We already have many wonderful and unique perks for you that you will enjoy even before we make these improvements! We have books for children and adults, teaching and learning aids, piano learning software and a one of a kind curriculum that will help you to start your world-class music education right away!Risks & ChallengesSince Soft Mozart is an existing and working system, our backers will be supporting without any risk.  You will have all the perks delivered right away along with a voucher to upgrade the Soft Mozart program to version 2.0 as soon as it becomes available.We anticipate the first release of the upgraded version 2.0 in 5-6 months after the funding.For those who already with us:Please spread the word about our campaign.

Resumen:
¿Cuántos alumnos
quieren aprender a tocar piano, pero se desalientan por el tedio y la
frustración al querer leer hojas de música? ¿Hay otra manera para regresar la música
a sus raíces? ¿Hacerla accesible a todos los niños alrededor del mundo?
Mi nombre es
Hellene Hiner. Soy musicóloga y profesora de piano.
Después de obtener
una Maestría en musicología, me dispuse a recorrer un camino personal para
encontrar soluciones a los más grandes impedimentos para la educación musical
hoy en día, en particular los retos que encuentran los alumnos al leer a
primera vista el Gran Pentagrama.
Problema
identificado:
A lo largo del
camino, me tropecé con la respuesta y es algo que hemos sabido hace más de 1000
años. En los tiempos de los sencillos coros y solistas, un monje benedictino
llamado Guido, creó una manera para escribir música y este método se hizo muy
popular. Fue adoptado como la manera universal para escribir música y así hacer
posible que se pudieran leer canciones y tocarlas.
Y funcionó muy
bien hasta la creación de instrumentos de teclado como el piano: la orientación
visual de la notación musical de Guido es vertical y la orientación visual del
teclado del piano es horizontal.Mientras el
piano fue diseñado como la principal ´plataforma de conversión´ para la música
de occidente, su invención hizo que aprender a leer la música fuera intuitivo. 

Solamente miren la
siguiente ilustración. Si giramos el Gran Pentagrama 90 grados según las
manecillas del reloj, podremos ver que las teclas del piano son extensiones
visuales de las líneas y espacios del Gran Pentagrama.
Las personas que son prodigios musicales no necesitan como los principiantes,  este conocimiento porque ellos pueden ver
naturalmente la relación entre las teclas y los espacios del Gran Pentagrama,
cuando la mayoría de las personas no pueden verlo.
Por lo tanto, la gran
mayoría de las personas se esfuerza y desespera aprendiendo a leer música a
primera vista.

Dominar el piano se ha vuelto una habilidad reservada para una élite (con
solidez financiera) y para los prodigios (aquellos que nacen con talento) entre
nosotros.

¡ES TIEMPO DE HACER POSIBLE APRENDER PIANO Y LEER
NOTACION MUSICAL PARA LOS NIÑOS DE TODOS LOS ESTRATOS SOCIALES Y HABILIDADES!

La Solución y el Impacto del Descubrimiento
Aquí es donde
entra Soft Mozart. Hemos restaurado la música al modo en que Guido la concibió.
Hemos hecho más amigable la forma de leer notas en el Gran Pentagrama de nuevo.
Además, hemos
desarrollado una presentación visual del Gran Pentagrama que gradualmente lleva
al alumno de una presentación elemental de las notas musicales (de forma
horizontal) al Gran Pentagrama tradicional (de forma vertical).
Hacemos esto de
la misma manera en que un niño aprende a leer: De la elemental “A,”al texto
tradicional. La tecnología interactiva de la computación facilita la transición
de la presentación elemental de las notas musicales al Gran Pentagrama
tradicional.
Tanto así que
los niños pueden aprender a leer y tocar música antes de que aprendan a hablar.El Sistema Soft
Mozart enseña con éxito a cualquier persona desde los 2 hasta los 99 años.
Tenemos un registro comprobado de éxito en escuelas y hogares en 60 diferentes
países.Soft Mozart
ofrece además un sistema de capacitación para educadores musicales de
diferentes países. Actualmente ofrecemos capacitación en Inglés, Español y
Ruso.

Краткое содержание: 

Как много людей пробовали обучаться играть на фортепиано, но не смогли, получив взамен скучную зубрежку и разочарования? Но ведь изначально нотный текст изобретался наглядным и понятным для любого человека? Что же случилось в ходе развития музыкальной грамотности?
Меня зовут Елена Хайнер. Я по специальности музыковед и учитель музыки.  
После получения Диплома об окончании консерватории я начала свое индивидуальное исследование. Для нахождения основных неработающих блоков системы обучения пришлось посвятить много лет практики. Основным же предметом исследования стали сложности зрительного восприятия нотного текста, а именно Нотного Стана. 
Идентификация проблемы:
В течение работы над проблемы я натолкнулась на очень интересный ответ, мимо которого прошло не одно поколение музыкальных педагогов в течение более чем 1000 лет. Во времена создания простых одноголосных хоров и использования сольных инструментов монах – Бенедиктинец по имени Гвидо создал метод записи музыкальных звуков, который стал популярен и используется нами до сих пор.  Этот метод был принят как универсальный для записи музыкального текста, чтобы другие могли прочесть написанное и сыграть с помощью зрения, а не на слух.  
Все прекрасно работало до тех пор, пока в мир не пришли клавишные инструменты, в частности фортепиано. Зрительная ориентация для чтения музыки Гвидо оставалась вертикальной, но клавиши в свою очередь расположились горизонтально.  
Поскольку именно КЛАВИШИ смогли взять на себя функцию основной преобразовательной платформы для многоголосной Западно-Европейской музыки, создание клавишных инструментов и в особенности фортепиано лишило обучение чтению музыкального текста интуитивной легкости, которым обладало со дня создания. Взгляните на картинку ниже. Если повернуть Нотный Стан на 90 градусов по часовой стрелке, вы сможете увидеть, что клавиши являются наглядным продлением линеек и пространств Нотного Стана. Музыкально одаренные люди и профессионалы стараются увести новичков от этого знания, потому что для них более естественно опираться на слух и запоминать взаимосвязь между нотами и клавишами с помощью врожденных слуха и памяти.  Но для большинства обычных людей – это сложное и неблагодарное занятие. 

Именно поэтому большинство людей испытывает слишком много проблем, они не справляются с проблемами чтения и не способны читать нотный текст. 
Мастерство в игре на фортепиано стало прерогативой музыкально одаренной элиты (что помогает ей зарабатывать средства на жизнь) и вундеркиндов среди нас.НАСТУПИЛО ВРЕМЯ ДАТЬ ВОЗМОЖНОСТЬ ПОЛУЧИТЬ ПОЛНОЦЕННОЕ МУЗЫКАЛЬНОЕ ОБРАЗОВАНИЕ С ПОМОЩЬЮ ФОРТЕПИАНО И ЧИТКИ НОТ С ЛИСТА ВСЕМ ДЕТЯМ НЕЗАВИСИМО ОТ ИХ ПРИРОЛНЫХ СПОСОБНОСТЕЙ ИЛИ ВОЗМОЖНЕОСТЕЙ!
Решение проблемы и Значение Нашего Открытия
Именно здесь на выручку приходит программа Софт Моцарт. Мы вернули музыкальную запись к тем истокам, с которых началось восхождение изобретения Гвидо Аретинского, к тому, как это было задумано изначально. Мы сделали музыкальное чтение Нотного Стана дружественным для зрительного восприятия опять.  
Более того, мы разработали наглядные презентации Нотного Стана, постепенно усложняя нотную запись от Азбучной, элементарной подачи к традиционным, черно-белым горизонтальным нотам. 
Мы точно так же поступаем, когда учим детей читать: сначала с помощью Азбуки и Букваря, а потом книжек с картинками. Постепенно картинок становится меньше, а строчек письма больше. Компьютерная графика облегчает осуществление такого перехода и создает элемент интерактивности. 
Это так хорошо работает, что начинающие могут учиться читать ноты и играть музыку обеими руками даже задолго до того, как учатся разговаривать!    
Система Софт Моцарт эффективно обучает любого человека от 2 до 99 лет. У нас есть целый послужной список успешного применения программы в школах и домах людей в 60 странах мира. 
Софт Моцарт также предлагает обучающие курсы для учителей музыки и фортепиано из различных стран мира. В настоящее время мы обучаем по Английски, Русски и Испански.
ЗАСЛУГИ ПРОГРАММЫ СОФТ МОЦАРТ   

Со времени создания системы в 2002 году у нас появились десятки победителей фортепианных конкурсов в Украине, Испании и Израиле. 
Подход в обучении Софт Моцарт отлично работает в общеобразовательных школах и частных музыкальных студиях. Каждый ребенок получает музыкальное образование высочайшего качества: даже обучаясь в группе он занимается индивидуально, соревнуясь с самим собой. Для детей с ограниченными возможностями Софт Моцарт является прекрасным инструментом для развития. Как ничто другое Софт Моцарт мотивирует детей с ограниченными возможностями, обучает их фокусироваться и держать концентрацию, улучшать их навыки зрительного, слухового и тактильного восприятия музыкального текста. Занятия с программой способствуют развитиб речи. 
Софт Моцарт незаменим для развития детей раннего дошкольного возраста. Наш курс обучения подготавливает малышей с 24 месяцев к жизни, в которой их ждет не только музыкальный, но и академический успех. Мы используем обучение фортепиано как инструмент для построения прочного фундамента для развития ребенка: от начальных навыков умения увидеть небольшие объекты и сличать из, до более сложных понятий, необходимых в математике и других науках.  

Самой важной особенностью программы Софт Моцарт является, однако, ее уникальная возможность развития самоуважения, воображения, артистичности и уверенности в собственных силах.  
Присоединяйтесь к нам, чтобы помочь распространить это начинание и сделать программу доступной большому количеству детей и взрослых из разных стран мира!  

Что Нам Необходимо и Что Мы Можем Предложить Взамен

Résumé :

Combien de personnes ont essayé d'apprendre à jouer du piano, mais ont reçu de la frustration en faisant la  mémorisation ennuyeuse ?
Mais
 au départ, l'écriture musicale était claire et compréhensible pour tout
 le monde . Qu'est-il arrivé au cours de l'évolution de la musique ?

Je m'appelle Helen Heiner. Je suis musicologue et professeur de musique.


Après
 avoir reçu un diplôme du Conservatoire supérieur j'ai commencé mes 
propres recherches dans la méthodologie d'apprentissage de piano . J'ai 
consacré de nombreuses années  dans
 ma pratique pour trouver les principaux blocs cassés dans le système 
d'apprentissage . Le sujet principal de ma recherche était la complexité
 de la perception visuelle de la musique, précisément  - la portée.Identification du problème :Pendant
 les travaux sur ce problème, je suis tombée sur une réponse très 
intéressante, qui était ignorée par beaucoup de générations de 
professeurs de musique du passé pendants plus que 1000 ans . À l'époque 
de la création de simples
choeurs
 à une voix et d'utilisation d'instruments solistes ,un certain moine - 
bénédictin nommé Guido mis au point une méthode d'écriture des sons 
musicaux qui est devenue très populaire et utilisée jusqu'à présent.
Cette
 méthode est devenue universelle pour l'écriture du texte musical pour 
permettre la lecture et l'écriture de la musique plutôt visuellement 
qu'à l'oreille . Tout a bien fonctionné jusqu'au moment d'arrivée des 
instruments à clavier. Orientation visuelle de lecture de la musique du 
système Guido reste verticale, mais les touches se retrouvent en 
position horizontale.

Puisque c'est le clavier qui  pourrais
 prendre le relais de la fonction de la plateforme de réglementation 
pour la musique polyphonique d'Europe de l'ouest , la création 
d'instruments à clavier et en particulier piano a privé l'apprentissage 
de la lecture  musicale de  la facilité intuitive qu'elle possédait depuis sa mise en place.
Regardez
 la photo ci-dessous. Si vous bougez la portées de 90 degrés vers la 
droite, vous pouvez voir que les touches forment une extension claire et
 précise des espaces de la portée .
Les
 professionnels et les gens doués en musique essaient de détourner les 
nouveaux arrivants de cette connaissance, parce que pour eux c'est plus 
naturel de s'appuyer sur l'oreille intuitive et de mémoriser la relation
 entre les notes et les touches du clavier. Mais pour la plupart des 
gens  ordinaires c'est une tâche difficile et ingrate.

C'est pourquoi ils ressentent trop de difficultés et sont incapables de faire face aux problèmes de lecture et n'arrivent pas a  lire la partition musicale .

Malheureusement la perfection pianistique reste le privilège d'une élite musicale, des gens doués et des génies au piano .

LE TEMPS EST VENU DE DONNER  À NOS ENFANTS , INDEPENDAMMENT  DE LEUR CAPACITES NATURELLES ET TALENTS,  LA POSSIBILITÉ
D'OBTENIR UNE ÉDUCATION MUSICALE COMPLÈTE À L'AIDE DE PIANO ET DE LECTURE À VUE .

La solution du problème est l'importance de notre découverte:

Et en ce moment-là précisément le programme Soft Mozart viens au secours. Nous avons retourné l'écriture musicale  vers ses  racines , la d'où avais  commencé l'ascension l'invention de Guido d'Arezzo.Nous avons fait la lecture musicale de la Portée  à nouveau  amicale pour la perception visuelle .

En outre, nous avons développé plusieurs  présentations
 visuelles de la portée , en rajoutant peu à peu les difficultés de la 
notation musicale élémentaire alphabétique et verticale vers la notation  traditionnelle horizontales avec les notes en noir et blanc.

De la même 
manière nous enseignons aux enfants la lecture de livres : en commençant
 par l'alphabet et par la suite en lisant les livres avec des images.
Petit à petit la quantité des images diminue et l'écriture augmente.
L'Infographie facilite cette transition et crée un élément d'interactivité.

Ça marche très 
bien et les petits débutants peuvent apprendre la lecture musicale et le
 jeu des mains ensemble même avant d'apprendre à parler.

Le système Soft
 Mozart enseigne efficacement toute personne de 2 à 99 ans. Nous avons 
des antécédents d'utilisation réussie du programme dans les écoles et 
chez les particuliers dans 60 pays à travers le monde.

Le programme 
Soft Mozart offre également des cours de formation pour les professeurs 
de piano et de musique de différents pays du monde. Actuellement, nous 
enseignons en anglais, espagnol et russe.

Les Mérites du  programme SOFT MOZART  :

depuis la création du système en 2002 nous avons des dizaines de gagnants des concours de piano en Ukraine, Espagne et Israël.

Cette approche 
dans l'enseignement Soft Mozart fonctionne très bien dans les écoles 
primaires, secondaires et les studios de musique privées. Chaque enfant 
reçoit une éducation musicale de haute qualité : même pendant ses études
 dans un groupe il travaille individuellement, en compétition avec 
soi-même .

Pour les 
enfants ayant une déficience Soft Mozart est un excellent outil pour 
leur développement. Comme rien d'autre Soft Mozart motive les enfants 
handicapés , les entraîne à se concentrer et à garder la concentration, à
 améliorer leurs compétences de perception visuelle, auditive et tactile
 de la lecture musicale. Les cours avec le programme contribuent au 
développement de la parole.

Soft Mozart est
 indispensable pour le développement des enfants d'âge préscolaire. Nos 
cours préparent les tous petits à la vie musicale et académique réussie.

Nous utilisons le piano comme un outil pour la création d'une base solide du développement enfantin :
: de la capacité initiale de voir des petits objets et de les comparer jusqu'aux  concepts plus complexes nécessaires en mathématiques et autres sciences.


La 
caractéristique la plus importante du programme Soft Mozart, toutefois, 
est sa capacité unique à construire l'estime de soi-même,  imagination, développer le talent artistique et confiance en soi-même .

Joignez-vous à 
nous pour aider à diffuser cette initiative et rendre notre programme 
disponible pour un grand nombre d'enfants et d'adultes du monde entier !

Ce que nous avons besoin et ce que nous pouvons offrir en retour:

Notre système de logiciel a été créé il y a 14 ans. L'impact de cette découverte a dépassé nos attentes les plus fortes  ! Mais après tant d'années, il est temps de moderniser la base informatisée.

Nous avons besoin de fonds pour les pas suivants:


1. La mise à jour du logiciel avec des graphismes et fonctionnalité améliorés .

2. L'ajout  de nouvelles pièces, d'exercices et de jeux afin d'assurer une communication encore plus agréable et facile avec le programme.

3. La traduction des cours en autres langues, le rajout l'apprentissages jusqu'aux niveaux universitaires .

4. La création des applications pour les appareils mobiles.

5. Le 
développement de la formation en ligne pour les parents, les écoles et 
les élèves sous la forme de 12 étapes d'apprentissage.

6. La création d'une équipe du support technique .

7. La publicité du programme Soft Mozart et de ses résultats dans le domaine de l'éducation musicale.

Notre rémunération:

Nous avons déjà créé beaucoup de produits uniques qui sont  prêt-à-utiliser immédiatement avant l'apparition de la version améliorée.
Nous
 avons des livres pour enfants et adultes, matériel didactique, 
logiciels qui vous permettront de commencer immédiatement la formation 
au plus haut niveau!

Les risques et les éventuels retards :

Puisque Soft Mozart existe déjà et fonctionne bien nos sponsors sont protégés des risques importants :
tous
 les prix seront distribués immédiatement après la fin de la campagne 
avec un bon pour une mise à jour gratuite du logiciel 2.0 dès sa 
préparation .


Nous attendons la première version modernisée du système dans 5 à 6 mois de la réception de fonds.

A NON-PROFIT PRESCHOOL THROUGH 8TH GRADE PROGRAM THAT WILL INTEGRATE THREE SYSTEMS: TRADITIONAL MARTIAL ARTS, JAPANESE PHILOSOPHY, AND MONTESSORI EDUCATION. ​​

A BALANCED AND INCLUSIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT SO THAT CHILDREN OF ALL ABILITIES CAN REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. 

HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION WITH A SLIDING SCALE TUITION, SO THAT THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD TO PAY, DO, BUT NO CHILD IS EXCLUDED BASED ON LACK OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES.​​


The culture of Root Academy will inspire independent thinking, creative problem solving, and a deep sense of empathy and connection. This culture, along with integrated foreign language study, will prepare students to actively engage with their local community and the world surrounding them. 
Please visit our website for additional details!



Martial Arts


Daily martial arts practice will build confidence as well as a strong sense of self.
Students will work through a series of mental and physical challenges to better understand how to confront such challenges, no matter how huge they may seem. 
Students use daily movement, breathing, and meditation to calm and focus for daily tasks.

Anyone can participate in martial arts.  The practice meets the individual where he or she mentally and physically exists. Therefore, it reaches out in a universal manner. 



                          

Japanese Philosophy



The Japanese philosophy of teaching is centered on the idea that children are individuals within a community. Each individual is responsible for the care of those surrounding them. 
Educators work to inspire a love of learning in each student and this is nurtured from the beginning.  Each student explores their natural abilities and ultimately how they may apply to the community at large. 
Students work together on everyday tasks such as cleaning the classroom, or Preparing and serving  lunch. Older students volunteer within their community. These activities build a sense of ownership, fondness, and also responsibility. The students are an integral part of the look and feel of the world that they are in each day. 

                            



Montessori



In the Montessori model, there is no requirement for students to be the same academically. Montessori teachers gently guide students in a positive, nurturing atmosphere that promotes independent learning. Classrooms are composed of students of mixed ages and abilities, who each bring with them unique challenges.  
Teaching materials are designed to help students feel confident, calm, challenged, and independent. In early childhood, they are often tactile and facilitate learning through touch and action. Chairs, tables, and other furniture are built to the students' needs, enabling the student to accomplish the full scope of a task without intervention.  All learning is facilitated by highly accomplished educators with a desire to nurture the individual person.

Students frequently work in groups or have group learning times, which bring students together in a way that encourages direct social activity. The need to compete against each other is eliminated. Students learn how to work together in a mutually beneficial way, naturally taking personal skills and applying them to a social challenge.        


                                   









WHO WE ARE
Root Academy is the shared vision of Heather MacKenzie Graham and Jarreau Elizabeth Gardner, two passionate and accomplished women who met each other and attended high school together at Holy Names Academy in Seattle more than twenty years ago. 

Heather MacKenzie Graham





Heather MacKenzie, the Executive Director and Founder of Root Academy, is a writer, teacher, and inspirational thinker. She lived with her family in Japan until the age of 9, while her father worked as a sea captain based out of Yokohama. MacKenzie began studying martial arts (Oom Yung Doe) after her son enrolled as a student at 9 years old.

She trained for just four years to earn a third degree black belt in 2010 and then became a head instructor in 2011. MacKenzie's students at the martial arts school were almost all children between the ages of 3-18, and a large percentage were referred to her by physicians and therapists for assistance with special needs or behavioral difficulties.

In addition to her martial arts teaching, MacKenzie has nearly twenty years of business management and ownership experience. She is the parent of three sons, is addicted to Minecraft (courtesy of one of them), and finds a good challenge irresistible.


Jarreau Elizabeth Gardner


Jarreau grew up on Capitol Hill in Seattle and attended a small family run Montessori school for several years in early childhood. Her Bachelor's degree was achieved in the field of Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of Washington in 1999. She went on to pursue graduate studies at Bastyr University and obtained a Master's degree in Nutrition in 2005, and then became a Registered Dietitian in 2006. 
She has spent many years professionally teaching and healing both adults and children, and is passionate about improving the lives of others. 

Jarreau is also the mom of two young boys with various special needs, and has dedicated much of the past several years of her life to their education and development. She has had intensive and personal experience with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), feeding difficulties, developmental delays, advanced learning, sensory processing disorders, and a variety of medical challenges. 

When she is not trying to change the world, Jarreau can usually be found gardening or organizing her son's massive Lego collection.











ONE PARENT EXPRESSES HER HOPES REGARDING HOW HER CHILD COULD BENEFIT FROM ROOT ACADEMY

""I have the great joy of parenting an amazing 8 year old child who currently attends a one-size-fits-all public school. Unfortunately, this placement only taps into a small piece of his pre-determined needs and does not allow him to explore his creative, imaginative & intuitive sides. School for him is just another day to get through instead of something to look forward to. 
The philosophy behind Root Academy really speaks to me. My child is lost in a maze of testing, fuzzy curriculum and endless transitions. Root Academy will nurture & educate our children by meeting them where they are. This allows them a safe space to come as individuals and learn through purposeful work in both body & mind. 
I look forward to watching him flourish in an environment that provides a solid foundation of physical & emotional strength that can take him anywhere he wants to go in life. I want my son to be around driven leaders who can inspire & ignite his fire for learning through meaningful work. I truly believe that this will be the best place for families who need & want more for their children's education.""

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<h3 align=""left""><b><b>Situational Analysis</b></b></h3>In
Nigeria, especially, northern Nigeria, gender inequities in health, education
and school attendance between boys and girls can be attributed to failure to
safeguard the health of girls in terms of menstrual health management. Girls
living at the base of the pyramid cannot afford sanitary pads, are afraid of
leaking and stay absent from school. A couple of
various research studies have identified menstruation as one of the key
development barriers to girls' school attendance and enrollment, as a Millennium
Development Goal. The Ruby Menstrual Cup will provide affordable and
sustainable menstrual health for these girls. This will positively impact on
school attendance and improve gender equity in education. Sanitary pads, on the other hand, are costly
and beyond the means of many households as well as associated with many infections
that may interfere with the reproductive functions of these girls when used
over a long term.</td>

YES, YOU CAN JOIN IN! WE ARE EQUIPPING 5000 GIRLS WITH A RUBY MENSTRUAL CUP IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM IN SCHOOL. NO MORE MISSING SCHOOL!!!


Empowered with a RUBY CUP , every girl CAN BE comfortable and not afraid of leaking during her period. It is a more comfortable, cheaper and healthier choice over sanitary pads or tampons, and much better for the environment because they do not produce waste. 


Situational AnalysisIn
Nigeria, especially, northern Nigeria, gender inequities in health, education
and school attendance between boys and girls can be attributed to failure to
safeguard the health of girls in terms of menstrual health management. Girls
living at the base of the pyramid cannot afford sanitary pads, are afraid of
leaking and stay absent from school. A couple of
various research studies have identified menstruation as one of the key
development barriers to girls' school attendance and enrollment, as a Millennium
Development Goal. The Ruby Menstrual Cup will provide affordable and
sustainable menstrual health for these girls. This will positively impact on
school attendance and improve gender equity in education. Sanitary pads, on the other hand, are costly
and beyond the means of many households as well as associated with many infections
that may interfere with the reproductive functions of these girls when used
over a long term.

  The Impact
Project
Target group: 
The ‘Ruby Cup Nigeria Project,’ particularly, targets adolescent girls and young women from
age 15-24 years, including other women of reproductive age up to 49 years of
age. 15-49 years age bracket accommodates girls and women of reproductive age, who
are actively menstruating and are prone to various health seeking behaviours
regarding their menstrual health.
What
Will this Project Achieve?
'Ruby Cup Nigeria Project' will empower 5000
girls at the base of the pyramid in Nigeria by providing them with affordable
and sustainable Ruby menstrual cups to manage their menstrual health and
hygiene and, by implication, equip them to attend and stay in school, and thus
unleashing a generation of healthy, confident and educated women. Training on the use of the cups, baseline survey, and distribution 5000
units of Ruby menstrual cups to 5000 BoP young girls and women across the following five (5) states in Nigeria (Abuja, Lagos, Enugu, Calabar and Kano), will be followed up a  with a post-distribution monitoring and follow-up  surveys. All these will be taking place from between April-November, 2015.

<p>We are 8 music majors studying trumpet at UW-Platteville.  We love what we do so much that we created this ensemble and rehearse and perform without doing this for college credit.  We really enjoy getting together to hang out and listen to music, talk trumpet, and play cool trumpet ensemble music like the ones in our video.  There will be over 1,000 trumpet players in attendance at the conference in May.  Trumpet players are generally a very collegial group, and the information and camaraderie that is exchanged during this week simply cannot be duplicated.<br/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div> <p>This is a very prestigious conference and a HUGE deal for us to be able 
to not only attend but PERFORM at the event.  As you may have heard, the
 University of Wisconsin system is undergoing some pretty dramatic 
budget cuts ($300,000,000!).  What this means for us is that our school 
will not be able to help us with any travel costs.  They are very proud of us for getting invited to perform, but regret not being able to help us.  So, if we want to 
go, we need to raise the money for travel, hotel, meals and registration
 ourselves.<br/></p>
<p>The conference this year will be held in Columbus, Ohio,  May 26-30.  Here are the financial details:</p>
<p>Hotel cost for the week = $2,400 ($160 per room for 5 days x 3 rooms)<br/></p>
<p>Conference registration = $2,000 ($250 per person x 8)<br/></p>
<p>Food for the week = $1,600 ($200 per person @ $40 per day x 5 days x 8)<br/></p>
<p>Travel (gas &amp; tolls) expense from Wisconsin to Ohio and back = $328  (gas $60 one way x 2 = $120, tolls $22 one way x 2 = $44, $164 per car x 2 cars)</p>
Our total financial need for this trip for the eight of us is $6,328.<br/>
</div><br/>Like we mentioned above, attending a conference that is specific to our career and musical passion is an educational opportunity that is somewhat difficult to describe.  The value of motivating and inspiring us to become better music teachers and music performers will enrich our communities and the people and students we come into contact with the rest of our lives.<br/><br/><div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>I understand that contribution

<p>I am Catalin Rudolf, founder and head of the <b>International</b> <b>Festival of Visual Arts</b> <b>VSLO</b> (Vama Sub Lumini de Oscar). I have a 10-year long experience in film making and in photography having worked as a Cameraman. In 2010 I have started the VSLO festival which this year will be in its 7th edition.</p>
<p>This crowdfunding is dedicated to the project of my life which became important to many people in the domain of art.</p>
<p>The festival VSLO also known as ""The Woodstock of Photography"" does not compare to anything similar in the domain.</p>
<p>It unfolds during 10 days and the participants benefit from 14 different photography workshops, 5 film making workshops, daily classes of film and photography, painting, theater, daily concerts, photographic exhibitions, movies (short and long) screenings and much more. A cultural exchange is taking place among generations, professionals and amator, international and national actors.</p>
<p>VSLO means <i>freedom of expression</i>, <i>a cultural and social melting pot</i>. Participation is totally <b>free of charge</b>. All 400 photographers , film makers and passionate of visual arts (selected upon a portfolio) may take part to any activity at no cost. The build contacts, professional and social, forming a community and exchanging ideas and opinions.</p>
<p>There is a moment in life when each of us is thrilled to offer something that counts to the other people. It is the happiest moment.</p>
<p>Even if the financial part should not intervene in this context, it is essential for the implementation. </p>
<p>I persevere, against all odds and pressures, to keep it a free of charge event. Nevertheless, its success and its exponential growth (in terms of subjects presented, of hours of courses, of number of lecturers and of participants) have been accompanied by an exponential growth of the production costs.</p>
<p>You can contribute in the development and the continuation of this unique festival. You can support and sponsor talented artists to get a free specialized training which otherwise they wouldn't  be able to afford. You can help young talents to reach out with their art. You can make people extremely happy and be part of this special community</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>The festival is unfolding over ten days and comprises several modules: <b>photography, film, theater, painting and concerts</b>.</p>
<p>Partnerships with various equipment manufacturers or other areas greatly help but the amounts are very far from the required value.</p>
<p><b>The Photo module</b> includes daily theoretical and practical courses. Every day two or more themes are treated. The module over 12 seminars are scheduled on various topics related to photography. In total 14 lecturers from 7 countries will be present (many of them major international prize winners) and 10 special guests. Young artists are encouraged to present their photography and therefore 14 exhibitions are held. They are all dedicated to young artists who have not had the opportunity or did not have financial means to do so.</p>
<p><b>The Film making module</b> includes theoretical and practical courses. The participants are encouraged to produce, during the 10 days of the festival, a short documentary or a story about the what is happening in the Vama Veche beach (and much is happening). Participants are passionate about this field but generally are people who can not afford expensive equipment or can not afford to attend classes delivered by world famous lecturers (a winner of an Emmy is among them) as these present at the VSLO. Every day there are projections in three different locations each one with its own specific: documentaries, short films and feature films. All these locations are chosen in open areas (beach) to be accessed by as many people as possible (the population in the Vama Veche sums up to many tens of thousands during August).</p>
<p><b>The Painting module</b> takes place during the whole festival and aims to discover new talents both from Romania and abroad. The two speakers are Romanians making their living form painting in Germany and Finland. They can best express how and what to do in order to pass from an amatorial to a professional status. This year we will introduce also <b>a new module: sculpture. </b></p>
<p><b>The Theater module</b> will be represented with 3 plays interpreted by young actors who are generally not accepted in big stages but they can express themselves freely in VSLO. Also module includes theoretical and practical courses about staging of a puppet show life size.</p>
<p><b>Outdoor concerts </b>will take place over a period of three days and will be attended by foreign and Romanian groups. Some of them are already famous but some others are new in the Romanian and international music scene.<br/>On music module we will have during of 4 days  drumming classes. The participants are encouraged to produce one show  which will be presented on the final day in front of all participants from all modules.</p>
<p>Funds will be needed to cover all the expenses for the lecturers (flights, general transport, accommodation, food etc). It will also finance the insurance for both the equipment put at the participants' disposal (professional cameras rental, lighting, computers for editing etc.) and the equipment necessary for the implementation of the event (screens, projectors, stage, lighting, etc.)</p>
<p>If this campaign will not raise the necessary funds, I will have to restrict some activities, to remove some modules and/or seek new partners.</p>
<p>Up to now it never happened and I have always collected the necessary financing. Someone up there is watching over me!</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Have you a talent that no one knows? Have you heard that a photograph of yours is not good? Have you ever wanted to have your own exhibition of paintings? Do you sing in a band but you have not been on a stage as everyone says ""you're unknown""?</p>
<p><b>All these are possible at Vama Sub Lumini de Oscar!</b></p>
<p>One of the international languages, if not the most important, is<b> art</b>. Without art and culture, the world would be much poorer. Ideas, freedom of expression, talent are characteristics of individuals who can move freely around the world and for which there are no borders. It's incredible how this festival brings together people of art, young talents, open minded people who learn to express themselves. To free their imagination and to unveil what society and everyday life repress! The love for the beauty. The festival is already on the verge of its 6th edition. Over time the number of direct participants increased from a few dozen to a few hundred totaling many thousands. <i>Thousands of friends in dozens of countries. Thousands of people who connected across borders through art.</i></p>
<p>All this happens in Vama Veche in Romania. Where, regardless where you come, you feel free, you feel important, you feel ... at home.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p><b>The project started 7 years ago</b>, at a time when nobody thought it would be possible to implement. A festival in which people interact 24/24 for 10 days it was hard to imagine. From this point of view, funding was a difficult obstacle. However there were few people who liked with the idea and helped me. I am talking about large companies that have sponsored or supported us through various forms (equipment, products ...). Nevertheless, the most important help came from the lecturers (photographers, film makers or visual art artists) who were invited to be part of this event. The were invited to hold a course of one day but in all cases they were present throughout the festival, answering questions, helping with various projects and being active in the community. This happens because they fall in love with the atmosphere of the festival, with Vama Veche, because they share the values of this event and ... of myself. Of my work, my dedication, my passion. I could say that I belong to the group of participants who are free to express their ideas, their wishes, their passion and which can come true. My passion is Vama Sub Lumini de Oscar.</p>
<p>Certainly the most difficult obstacle in achieving this dream is the lack of money.

If this campaign will not raise the necessary funds, I will have to restrict some activities, to remove some modules and/or seek new partners.
Up to now it never happened and I have always collected the necessary financing. Someone up there is watching over me!

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>A breakdown of our financial needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every month, the house needs to be heated, there needs to be electricity and hot water, and our kids need to eat.  These are, of course, the most basic necessities.</li>
<li>We have four full-time staff members who handle the care of the children and the house, and their salaries need to be paid monthly.</li>
<li>We have an administrator who runs the organization from Romania.</li>

<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is no way to measure the impact of changing a child's life, which has made fund-raising challenging for us.  Plenty of people like the idea of providing for children in need, but the burden of continuing to care for them year after year causes many to shy away from our organization when it comes time to donate.  Our kids participate in sports, art classes, and community events.  We have volunteers teaching them English on a constant basis.  We are now in the process of looking into high school for the older kids, and are even beginning to plan for their future once they've turned 18.  We'd like to form bonds with donors in the United States who wish to not only get to know the kids, but to stay in touch long term and keep track of their progress and growth.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>These kids, and all kids in similar positions, are at constant risk of becoming ""street children.""  It's very common for kids in foundations or government run housing to run away and live in communities that rely on begging and stealing to survive.  As such, it's incredibly important that we provide the kids with discipline and love, discouraging poor behavior and any desire to make the sorts of decisions that lead to living on the streets.</p>

If you can't give us some dough, don't stress, bro! You can:  Donate an old camera or camera equipment you're not using. Get in touch with one of us and we'll figure out details.
Spread the word of our campaign around. Be on the look out for our film!  

Thanks for checking us out!

   Strategic Objectives - Driving Growth

Growing Customer NumbersMassive
annual increase in UK Student Population, now reaching upwards of 2.4 million
students across the country. Growth this big needs lots of feeding...We use a wide range of marketing channels to broaden and deepen understanding of our proposition, building loyalty amongst our existing customers, and extending our reach to potential new ones. These convert in significant numbers into engaged, frequently-shopping customers; further adding to our active customer pool.

Growing Customer SpendWe improve our range, quality of goods, product pricing and service to encourage customers to buy more of their weekly requirements from us. This, combined with increasing customer loyalty and shopping frequency, drives the size of customer basket, generating growth in the business.

Developing Proposition to CustomersOur proposition to customers is to “make shopping easy”. We do this by continually improving their shopping experience in three key areas, in some of which we are increasingly competitive in the market:


Impeccable service and unrivalled reliability
Competitive value
Growing range and freshest products








Risks & Challenges  The growth of city-centre convenience stores and Increase in Online Grocery Shopping at leading Supermarkets both pose challenges to our growth in customer base during 2016/17.  We shall tackle the convenience store growth through adopting a focus on providing competitive pricing across thousands of product lines. Through establishing long-term purchasing agreements with our main suppliers, we minimise stock holding, dramatically reducing overall shrinkage and product waste, allowing us to offer a competitive price point on popular product lines across our store.







We shall tackle the natural adoption toward leading supermarket chains online platforms by offering our users competitive product pricing, free delivery on any order over £30 in value, a NO minimum order spend policy, 10% off each customer's first grocery shop and a further 20% OFF loyalty code following every £100 a customer spends in our online store.

This will allow us to offer flexible part time work opportunities, create earning opportunities for students, increase our customer pool and organically enhance our business exposure throughout the student community.



Our University PartnershipsWe have established strong relationships with the University of Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh Napier University and Queen Margaret University whom operate a 65,000+ person student population in total.
Their support allows us to establish well placed order collection points within student accommodation residences, grants us exclusive entry to distribute pre-semester marketing material throughout Student Accommodation blocks, advertisement exposure across all campuses throughout the university year and sponsorship agreements with University sports teams and other societies.

Solutions for real-time delivery route optimisation, vehicle tracking, and customer e-mail alerts.
Machine-learning techniques that drive our consumer demand forecasting

This has given us an improved platform of intellectual property and operating knowledge, which we use to improve efficiency and operations.


Our Infrastructure                                               



Regional Distribution Centre Based In Edinburgh, allowing easy access to the growing 65,000+ person student population.Our Multi-Temperature delivery vehicles are used to transport goods direct from our distribution centre to our customers door.


Strategically Positioned Distribution Centre, no more than 10-15 minutes from the four heavily student-populated university accommodation areas. This allows for inexpensive and efficient delivery of orders to thousands of customers across Edinburgh and The Lothians.We believe that due to the financial status many students share, this infrastructure and model can be replicated in many other large cities across Scotland and eventually the rest of the UK, such as Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, exposing our services to the UK's growing 2.4 million person student population.




Who are we?






















Helping the Cause
It's not just about the money. Yes, we obviously need it - but we also need to build up excitement and momentum behind the service so that lots of people will go and choose Student Savers for their grocery needs. If you're not in a position to contribute financially you can still make a big difference by spreading the word on Facebook, Twitter or via blogs.





Thanks for your time!

<p>Creation of a school where children of all creeds, races, ages and socio economic backgrounds can learn and grow in an unhurried, relaxed atmosphere; where enrollment would be limited so that the children, staff, and parents would all get to know one another; and where parents would share intimately in the life of the school and in the education of the children.  All would be respected as thinking, feeling human beings and treated humanely. The issues affecting their lives daily— the environment, war and peace, poverty, corruption and world issues— would be part of the curriculum. Every aspect of a student’s growth— physical, spiritual, mental and psychological— would receive attention. Inova students would be free to resolve the conflicts that inevitably arise in the workings of a group.</p>
<p>As well as traditional subject development, we will also have special focus on arts, music, language, culture and environment, teaching healthy eating habits, working with plants and gardening.</p>
<p>This school is a democratic school, with mixed age groups where subjects are built into larger all round personal or group projects; the students chose their projects based on their own interests.</p>
<p>Students with learning difficulties will be given extra time, attention and support to find their most productive learning paths.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Goals &amp; Objectives</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Goal  – Provide a quality educational facility for a deprived community that not only leads the way towards successful professionals but also well rounded and confident community members.</strong></p>

<p>Objective #1.2 – Stimulate and encourage cultural and community spirit.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Skills Africa Centre Project: Creating Opportunities that Reverse Negative Economic Migration of African Youths</strong></h2>
<p><i>Let's help the next generation of prospective economic migrants pursue meaningful opportunities in their home countries.</i></p>
<p>The Skills Africa Centre project is an initiative of Knowledge and Productivity Education for Africa Initiative (KPEAI). KPEAI is a registered education charity (CAC/IT/NO/87520 ) geared towards setting up functional and well-resourced experiential learning empowerment education centres across Africa starting with Nigeria.</p>
<p>The Skills Africa Centre project aim to create an institution that will focus solely on the teaching of experiential learning based empowerment education which aims to transition, the youth of Africa from the four walls of academic learning into the real world of the labour market and entrepreneurship.  This kind of formal work ready learning opportunity does not exist currently in any African country.  KPEAI therefore wants to help bridge this gap, starting from Nigeria.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.kpafrica.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">View the KP Africa website</a>, <a href=""http://www.kpafrica.org/about/our-people/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Learn more about Our board of trustees</a>, <a href=""http://skillsafrica.kpafrica.org/our-team/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Learn more about the project team</a>. We are supported by a large enthusiastic group of local and international accomplished academics and professionals ready to volunteer their services to Skills Africa Centre.</p>

<p><strong>Our Quest</strong></p>
<p>Our quest now is to set up a centre that will be dedicated to solely teaching this work ready academic to work transition programme to help reduce unemployment and illegal economic migration. The troubling part is that a large population of the next wave of economic migrants are in the classrooms of secondary schools and lecture halls of universities in Africa. Without the work ready academic to work, transition skills set, to navigate the real world of work,  upon graduation, and wrongly believing that all hope for the future lies in Europe or the USA, they will make the journey - which, very often, ends badly for everyone. </p>
<p><i>The current out of control migration crisis is a clear example. </i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477860162/vljvprnlfiuk5p1o3gp3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>We are aware that daily an average of 1000 African youths make this treacherous and dangerous journey abroad in search of a better life which most times does not end well as shown in the picture above but with your intervention these numbers can be drastically reduced.</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478704823/druaqwwr017zpqwtjccm.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478704892/dujznozn4ykov6bapgpo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>What we have done so far </strong></p>
<p>Our research in the last five years that culminated in the setting up of this project  suggest that, this lack of work ready - academic to work transition programme has increased the number of unemployed, frustrated young adults and  youths who end up becoming illegal economic migrants.  Because we understand the root cause of the problem, we put together 13 weeks Skills Africa programme, which adopts the booth camp style tutoring pedagogy, we have pilot tested and started deploying the programme, see documentary link posted by graduates of the programme.</p>

<p><strong><i>Why Skills Africa Centre Project</i></strong></p>
<p>Helping us set up this Skills Africa Centre in Lagos Nigeria, will enable us scale up the deployment and teaching of Skills Africa experiential learning programme and be in a position to reach out to more youths of Africa starting from Nigeria.</p>
<p>We therefore need your help to scale this project.</p>
<ol>
<li>Beyond the pilot, and  reach every University  in Nigeria</li>
<li>Beyond Universities, and reach Secondary schools as well as every unemployed youth.</li>
<li>And finally beyond Nigeria, and reach the whole of Africa.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Skills Africa Centre will provide enabling environment that will produce enlightened, confident, entrepreneurial African youths with labour market and innovative acumen with capacity to participate in the mass self-empowerment opportunities available in their home countries. </p>
<p><strong>What you will help us Achieve</strong></p>
<p>Helping  us meant giving an opportunity to these African youths to gain education that will enable them  unleash their creative innovation across Africa, thus becoming a large army of entrepreneurs, job creators and not just job seekers, creative thinkers contributing wealth and prosperity to Africa and the world and not just takers or illegal economic migrants. Please also Meet this South African Graduate that would benefit from participating in Skills AFRICA Project <a href=""http://www.tori.ng/news/29823/awww-this-photo-of-a-beautiful-girl-who-took-to-th.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click Here</a>.</p>

</div></div>","Skills Africa Centre Project: Creating Opportunities that Reverse Negative Economic Migration of African Youths
Let's help the next generation of prospective economic migrants pursue meaningful opportunities in their home countries.
The Skills Africa Centre project is an initiative of Knowledge and Productivity Education for Africa Initiative (KPEAI). KPEAI is a registered education charity (CAC/IT/NO/87520 ) geared towards setting up functional and well-resourced experiential learning empowerment education centres across Africa starting with Nigeria.
The Skills Africa Centre project aim to create an institution that will focus solely on the teaching of experiential learning based empowerment education which aims to transition, the youth of Africa from the four walls of academic learning into the real world of the labour market and entrepreneurship.  This kind of formal work ready learning opportunity does not exist currently in any African country.  KPEAI therefore wants to help bridge this gap, starting from Nigeria.
View the KP Africa website, Learn more about Our board of trustees, Learn more about the project team. We are supported by a large enthusiastic group of local and international accomplished academics and professionals ready to volunteer their services to Skills Africa Centre.
Some of the Skills Africa Project team members 
              
 

Our Quest
Our quest now is to set up a centre that will be dedicated to solely teaching this work ready academic to work transition programme to help reduce unemployment and illegal economic migration. The troubling part is that a large population of the next wave of economic migrants are in the classrooms of secondary schools and lecture halls of universities in Africa. Without the work ready academic to work, transition skills set, to navigate the real world of work,  upon graduation, and wrongly believing that all hope for the future lies in Europe or the USA, they will make the journey - which, very often, ends badly for everyone. 
The current out of control migration crisis is a clear example. 

We are aware that daily an average of 1000 African youths make this treacherous and dangerous journey abroad in search of a better life which most times does not end well as shown in the picture above but with your intervention these numbers can be drastically reduced.

What we have done so far 
Our research in the last five years that culminated in the setting up of this project  suggest that, this lack of work ready - academic to work transition programme has increased the number of unemployed, frustrated young adults and  youths who end up becoming illegal economic migrants.  Because we understand the root cause of the problem, we put together 13 weeks Skills Africa programme, which adopts the booth camp style tutoring pedagogy, we have pilot tested and started deploying the programme, see documentary link posted by graduates of the programme.
Skills Africa ELB 420 Documentary
Below is photo speak of recent Skills Africa Experiential Learning ELB 420 programme.

Some graduation pictures of Skills Africa participants of the tagged ELB 420 in May 2016
Above are pictures of some students receiving their Experiential Learning  in Entrepreneurship and Employ-ability Training Certification. 
Why Skills Africa Centre Project
Helping us set up this Skills Africa Centre in Lagos Nigeria, will enable us scale up the deployment and teaching of Skills Africa experiential learning programme and be in a position to reach out to more youths of Africa starting from Nigeria.
We therefore need your help to scale this project.

Beyond the pilot, and  reach every University  in Nigeria
Beyond Universities, and reach Secondary schools as well as every unemployed youth.
And finally beyond Nigeria, and reach the whole of Africa.

The Skills Africa Centre will provide enabling environment that will produce enlightened, confident, entrepreneurial African youths with labour market and innovative acumen with capacity to participate in the mass self-empowerment opportunities available in their home countries. 
What you will help us Achieve
Helping  us meant giving an opportunity to these African youths to gain education that will enable them  unleash their creative innovation across Africa, thus becoming a large army of entrepreneurs, job creators and not just job seekers, creative thinkers contributing wealth and prosperity to Africa and the world and not just takers or illegal economic migrants. Please also Meet this South African Graduate that would benefit from participating in Skills AFRICA Project Click Here.
The Impact you will be helping us to make
You will be helping these youths create the prosperity and stability that would arrest or reduce the scourge of illegal economic migration with all its associated problems for the countries of origin and destination. Prosperity in developing countries create the ""emerging market"" phenomena, which  increases global prosperity, promotes peaceful co-existence, reduces inequality and  mass illegal migration.

<h3><strong>About Project Cyma and Our Project</strong></h3>
<p>At Project Cyma, we strive to directly engage local populations in development projects that sprout prosperity and self-reliance within their very own communities. After all, ""Cyma"" is Latin for ""sprout""! We've decided to team up with the American University of Nigeria’s (AUN) Peace Through Sports program. We are developing 3G and WiFi-capable tablets to be used by the program’s participants. The primary activities of Peace through Sports are to identify vulnerable youths, organize a Peace and Conflict Resolution workshop for the young people involved, organize the participants into unity teams, conduct training sessions, and organize sporting events. The initiative provides participants with an alternate route, as Boko Haram often lures young Nigerians to join their group through offers of loans, paychecks, and stability. One Peace Through Sports participant put it best: ""it was this or Boko Haram."" </p>
<p>With funding to support this effort, AUN plans to reach an additional 5,250 beneficiaries from all seven local governments in Adamawa. Adamawa is a state in Nigeria that has been severely impacted by Boko Haram's violence. The Peace through Sports initiative provides an opportunity for young people from vulnerable and marginalized communities to demonstrate their roles in the mission of global friendship, peace, and development through participation in sports and relevant workshops.  </p>
</div><div>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>It is our conviction that Cyma's tablets combined with Peace Through Sports' existing program will have a tangible impact upon the young people in northern Nigeria that have been affected by Boko Haram's violence, largely because <i>it has already been proven to work</i>. In past years of Peace Through Sports, 216 participants have secured employment through this program and 91 have gone back to high school or college. Some of the participants (29 thus far) have gone on to play for state teams in Adamawa, Gombe, Taraba, and Yobe. Participants also receive ICT training, free college entrance exam tutoring, business and entrepreneurship training, and peace and conflict resolution training.</p>
<p>Others continue in the program where they can constructively fill their otherwise empty days and continue to learn the values of teamwork, discipline, tolerance, and respect for and greater understanding of their teammates and opponents’ culture and religion. For some, this program is the only alternative to turning to a life of crime and violence. </p>
<h3><strong>The Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>We realize the risks and challenges involved in such an endeavor, and we are actively consulting professionals in the realms of humanitarian aid, international development, counterterrorism and counter extremism, nonprofits, and the private sector. We know what we’re attempting to tackle is no easy task, so please feel free to reach out if you'd like to get involved in some capacity — we welcome the help.</p>
<p>Your donation, your time, and/or your efforts to assist our project in any way is symbolic of the exact thing we’re trying to do on a larger scale: get individuals involved at the most fundamental levels and create a ripple effect with a far-reaching impact. Join us in challenging the existing concept of social responsibility and what it means to bring about lasting peace.</p>
<h3><strong>Where Your Donation is Going</strong></h3>
<p>With over 5,000 estimated participants in 2017, the task of providing a sufficient number of educational tablets is not an easy one, but we think we can do it (with your help). To start, we are hoping to raise enough money for the first 100 tablets, or $22,000.  </p>
<p>Donations will be put towards the tablets which enable participants to learn crucial and fundamental skills regarding peace, conflict resolution, and countering extremist narratives. Additionally, a small percentage of the donations (6.5%) will go to Social Good Fund, which sponsors and develops projects that will help positively impact and develop local communities into healthier and happier places to live, work, and be. </p>

<h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
<h4><b><br/>25 or 45?</b></h4>
<p>The game will allow for as many versions of this great game as possible.  It will start out with the basic 25 and 45.  The competitions will work in a Progressive 25 format.  In time we will have other versions such as Auction 45 and Reverse 25,  and probably other versions we have not even heard of yet.  One of the advantages of being a member is that you will be able to give your input on the rules, variations and versions as we go forward. <br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<h4>When will I be able to play?</h4>
<p>The game is already in a closed beta.  We have been playing with friends and family for months so the core of the game is already good.  Once the crowdfunding ends we will open up the beta to the people who contributed to this campaign as soon as possible.  </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;""><br/>Why Crowdfund?</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The <i>Help Save 25 </i>Crowdfunding initiative is
about encouraging people to become part of the largest 25 community ever!</p>
The groundwork for Play25 Online is already in
place, people have been playing for months, and feedback extremely positive, but
there is still work to do.  Additional
development is required to build the infrastructure for public and private
rooms, leaderboards and competitions.</div><div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div>The more members we can encourage to be a part of the world’s largest 25 community, the more we can do with and for the game.  As we develop the online product, we want to offer regular competitions and introduce Inter-County and All Ireland Championships and already have our sights set on hosting the inaugural 25 World Cup.</div><div>

<h4>25 is too difficult! Will this help me learn?</h4>
<p>It’s

<p>This

<h4>What are memberships?</h4>
<p>Memberships give you full access to all aspects of the site - public rooms, private rooms and competitions.</p>
<p>The Indiegogo early bird offer of €10 (and €15 thereafter) for a membership until the end of 2016 offers incredible savings.  It's our way of saying thank you for getting us started.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h4>What are private tables?</h4>
<p>Private tables are ideal for families or groups of friends and foes alike.  They allow you to create a table with people you know.</p>
<p>There will also be the option for full chat so the banter and insults can fly. <br/><br/></p>
<h4>Is this a gambling site?</h4>
<p>No.  We want to build a community where
enthusiasts of 25 can come together and play.  Our aim is to build our worldwide membership
to enable live games across countries, continents and time zones.  We hope to be in a position to run sponsored
competitions with prizes but not the facility to gamble.  So put your shilling back in your pocket! </p>

Share this page with as many of your friends and family as you can.  Put it on your Facebook page, Tweet about it, put our flyer (A4 format - Letter format) up in your local pub and community

Even if you are not interested in playing, but think this is a great cause - then please use your goodwill to help us put Ireland’s National Card Game on the International Map.




FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
25 or 45?
The game will allow for as many versions of this great game as possible.  It will start out with the basic 25 and 45.  The competitions will work in a Progressive 25 format.  In time we will have other versions such as Auction 45 and Reverse 25,  and probably other versions we have not even heard of yet.  One of the advantages of being a member is that you will be able to give your input on the rules, variations and versions as we go forward. 


When will I be able to play?
The game is already in a closed beta.  We have been playing with friends and family for months so the core of the game is already good.  Once the crowdfunding ends we will open up the beta to the people who contributed to this campaign as soon as possible.  
Why Crowdfund?

The Help Save 25 Crowdfunding initiative is
about encouraging people to become part of the largest 25 community ever!
The groundwork for Play25 Online is already in
place, people have been playing for months, and feedback extremely positive, but
there is still work to do.  Additional
development is required to build the infrastructure for public and private
rooms, leaderboards and competitions.The more members we can encourage to be a part of the world’s largest 25 community, the more we can do with and for the game.  As we develop the online product, we want to offer regular competitions and introduce Inter-County and All Ireland Championships and already have our sights set on hosting the inaugural 25 World Cup.



25 is too difficult! Will this help me learn?
It’s
an Irish game ... not a game for fools.  This adds to the appeal of the game and once you learn the rules you will be part of an exclusive club.
We will help you by


showing card rankings when you need them
disabling cards you are not allowed play
having other visual cues to help you feel like a pro 








I am a 25 expert, is this the place for me?
This
place is made for you – unless of course you doubt your own 25 ability!  With leaderboards and statistics this community will make you fall in love with the game even more.  Imagine the bragging rights by being able to share that you are the best player in your Town, County or even all of Ireland.  Who knows, you might be able to prove you are the best player in the world.

What are memberships?
Memberships give you full access to all aspects of the site - public rooms, private rooms and competitions.
The Indiegogo early bird offer of €10 (and €15 thereafter) for a membership until the end of 2016 offers incredible savings.  It's our way of saying thank you for getting us started.


What are private tables?
Private tables are ideal for families or groups of friends and foes alike.  They allow you to create a table with people you know.
There will also be the option for full chat so the banter and insults can fly. 
Is this a gambling site?
No.  We want to build a community where
enthusiasts of 25 can come together and play.  Our aim is to build our worldwide membership
to enable live games across countries, continents and time zones.  We hope to be in a position to run sponsored
competitions with prizes but not the facility to gamble.  So put your shilling back in your pocket! 


Isn't stuff on the internet usually free?

We want to offer the best online game experience of 25 possible.
No pop-up adverts, no in-app purchases, no distractions, just cards and this iconic game at its best.
The game deserves it, our members deserve it! Thanks,
Padraig Gorry - Kilbeggan, Co. WestmeathRebecca Stevens - Sligo, Co. Sligo
""You haven't played 25 till you played it down in a country pub with a crowd of auld timers. Make one mistake and you could be ate. You could be coming last when you score a trick and you think you're great only to get a clatter across the head and be never let play again. Not a game for fools."" - Anonymous",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We've been officially operating since 2013, and your previous support - as well as the continuous financial flow of support from our LLC Company, Urban Circus NYC, have kept the school alive, financing our current studio space, safety equipment, mats, insurance, and aerial apparatus. But in order to expand our reach and help more kids, we need your help.</p>
<p>WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES:</p> <ul> <li>SPACE - Although we are currently operating out of a loft in Bushwick to keep expenses as low as possible as we continue to build our program, we will be seeking a new building in 2016, where we can expand our impact and maximize the potential of KATANA NYC to be the Flagship School for the global Model. </li> <li>INTERNATIONAL OUTREACH - We have been developing our team and program in LEBANON since 2014, as well as putting down roots and building foundations in Malaysia, Cambodia, and BANGLADESH in 2015. We offer classes to children in need from street kids to refugees, completely free - your donation supports the opportunity to continue to serve countless young souls who's lives can be transformed by the experience of going upside down.</li>
<li>INSURANCE - Insurance Costs for Aerial Acrobatics are incredibly high - it costs thousands of dollars a year to maintain safe coverage for our students.</li>
<li>SUPPORT STAFF - our current instructors and performers pour their heart and soul into this company, but they have to eat! Finances raised will help support fair pay and salary for the staff who support the school, and who could not continue to do so without all of you. </li> <li>EQUIPMENT - additional funds will provide much needed equipment, including a new trapeze, mats, and rigging essentials to maintain and improve our existing system while upholding the highest standards of safety for our kids.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<p>The TIF Illumination Project has
been using data mining, investigatory journalism, map making, graphic design
and community organizing to explore and explain the impacts of Chicago's 151
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts. We do this on a ward-by-ward basis. </p>
<p>When we visit a ward - as we do in a public town forum we
call an ""Illumination"" - we reveal:</p>
<ul>
<li>an overview of TIFs in Chicago and Cook County</li>
<li>how many TIFs are in the ward</li>
<li>how much property taxes those TIFs took FROM that ward</li>
<li>how much money was left over in TIF accounts from the
     ward</li>
<li>what projects were funded by TIFs</li>
<li>if any money was transferred in or out of those TIFs</li>
<li>how much money the Chicago Department of Planning and
     Development skimmed to cover their own internal costs</li>
</ul>
<p>We do a one hour presentation that
explains all this and we pass out a map that summarizes this information. Here
is one we did for the 21st ward:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1140263/files/20150109112224-21st_Ward_handout.JPG?1420831344"" src="""" style=""""/></p>No one else can tell this story in
the level of detail and clarity that we provide. 

<p>Sine we launched this effort in
February of 2013 we have been invited all over the city to make these
presentations. As of January 9, 2015 we have done 27 public meetings that have
Illuminated 134 TIF districts across 30 wards in front of over 4,000 people! You
can see the full record of these presentations <a href=""http://www.tifreports.com/tif-town-meetings"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>here</span></a>.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1140266/files/20150109112426-SRO-Aug_8.jpg?1420831466"" src="""" style=""width: 606.667px; height: 455px;""/></p>Public education is critical to
exposing and opposing the massive abuses we've seen in the TIF program. We are producing five short videos and post them online so anyone can watch and
learn.

<p>Here are the five videos we wish to
produce:</p>
<p>(1) <b>TIF 101 </b>- What are TIFs,
how do they work and what is their history in Illinois, Cook County and
Chicago. <i><b>Already done!</b></i><br/></p>
<p>(2) <b>The TIF Hall of Shame</b> - see above</p>
<p>(3) <b>TIFs and Public Schools</b> -
Every dollar of property taxes that goes missing from the treasury is one less
dollar to fund local government. In Illinois we rely heavily on property taxes
to fund public education. In Chicago we are supposed to direct about 56 cents
of every dollar in property taxes collected to fund the Board of Education.
That is not happened because of TIFs. We'll break it down in detail in this
video.</p>
<p>(4) <b>TIF Organizing</b> - As of
the launch of this campaign we've been in 16 wards for TIF Illuminations and so
we've met dozens of neighbors who are organizing around TIFs. Who are they and
what did they learn from the TIF Illumination Process and what are doing
now? </p>
<p>(5) <b>Alternatives To TIFS:
Grassroots Community Development Innovation </b>- Chicago is a hotbed of
innovation in hyper local community development efforts. The problem is most of
this work is not recognized or seriously funded. We'll meet some key local
organizers who are really making a difference in their communities. Their work
shows us clear and compelling alternatives to the TIF Program.</p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We need to raise $2,000 to produce each
video. The videos will be free to watch online and we will sell DVDs of them
that will contain spreadsheets and other material we use in our work, including
a PDF of a ""TIF Primer.""</p>

<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>TIFs are a BIG deal in Chicago. We
have 151 TIF districts and in 2013 they extracted $422 million in property
taxes from Chicago property owners. Since TIFs were first started here in 1986
they have made off with over $6 BILLION. What happened to all that money? The
TIF Illumination Project is answering that question.</p>
<p>

so in way that educates and activates people all over the city!</p>
<p>We've been to 24 public meetings,
many of them focusing on one particular ward. Each meeting has been organized
by a different team of community members. Over 3,600 people have attended these
meetings. Here a few images from these Illuminations. The full record of all
these meetings is <a href=""http://www.tifreports.com/tif-town-meetings"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>here</span></a>.</p>

<br/>
We demanded that TIF impacts be placed on our property tax bills - along with
the other units of government that take our property taxes. Believe it or not,
up to this July - if you lived in a TIF district your property tax bill was
LYING to you by putting a ZERO ext to the TIF district - meaning that it took
none of your property tax dollars. In July of 2014, for the first time, <a href=""http://www.cookcountyclerk.com/newsroom/newsfromclerk/Pages/ClerkOrrunveilsTIFinformationontaxbills,releasestaxrates.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cook County Clerk David Orr added this

can take some credit for this long overdue reform.<br/>
<br/>
Now, due to the work of the TIF Illumination Project, TIFs are popping up in
local races for City Council here. This is a huge issue for Chicago and we're
keeping it in the spotlight!<br/>
<br/>
TIFs are a BIG deal throughout Illinois and the USA. In Illinois some 1,200 TIF
districts strip about $1.1 BILLION in property taxes from 550 municipalities
every year. Since TIFs came to Illinois they have made off with $14 BILLION.
What happened to all that money. All that public money. Every single dollar was
a dollar of property tax that SHOULD'VE gone to fund local government.<br/>
<br/>
We have no idea how many TIF districts there across the entire USA. <i><b>We estimate
that they collect on the order of $20 BILLION every year. </b></i>That's a pretty big
slush fund that is mostly off the books, opaque and unaccountable to local tax
payers.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually we want to expand this project to communities across the country
where they are burdened with TIF districts. We are working with civic coders to
build a web tool that will allow organizations to create their local versions

Engage is a nonprofit  research and advocacy organization working on
Pakistan’s blasphemy law. The mass support for
this narrative makes it  a potent
legal instrument for intimidation, violence and enacting personal vendettas, and specific persecution of minorities.  We are attempting to deconstruct the law and its surrounding social narrative through the framework that informs it--the first attempt of its kind. Please take the time to go through the rest of our profile and the introductory video above which summarizes the problem and how we propose to address it.The LawThe law (section 295-C of Pakistan Penal Code) holds that anyone convicted of the offense of blasphemy against the prophet Muhammad is to be awarded a fixed death penalty, with no possibility of a pardon or waiver.            1.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! We're ShadowMe Inc. and we're law students working on a project called ShadowMe. ShadowMe is meant to help those who never discovered their passion. There are so many people, especially teenagers, who will never know about different professions in this world that they would excel in. ShadowMe will change that! ShadowMe will help those in all communities and walks of life discover paths they may not have ever known were even a possibility for them. People will now be able to discover their passion and see others who have done the same. Most of all, we want to help children/teenagers in underprivileged neighborhoods realize that they have other options other than what they see around them. We want to create a world where people can envision themselves doing what they love and seeing what it takes to get there. ShadowMe will begin that process. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All of the money will all go towards development and marketing for ShadowMe. It will increase awareness and begin placing the technology needed to get ShadowMe to market while also keeping the cost for all users free. If we do not reach our entire goal, the money will still go towards development as much as possible to pay those who are working hard behind the scenes to get this project off the ground.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you contribute to this project, you will be helping people around the world discover their passion and happiness. You will help children, teens and adults realize that they have other options in this life and they can decide their path. Help save money for kids in college that keep switching majors because they're terribly confused and unhappy with the path they've chosen.  But ShadowMe can also help you as well if you think that you have never discovered your passion either!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's not too many risks for this project besides making sure that we are able to reach our targeted audience. We also have to be sure that we have legitimate professionals helping to guide those that use our site. But we have a plan for that! We will make sure we have a system that verifies each one of the professionals that apply. We will also make sure that we keep the cost down on this project so that everyone who uses it will still be able to use it, no matter how successful it becomes.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, then please help spread the word about this campaign so that people can help donate. It would be extremely helpful and we would be so grateful. Those who you are helping through this app will be grateful as well!

Hi! We're ShadowMe Inc. and we're law students working on a project called ShadowMe. ShadowMe is meant to help those who never discovered their passion. There are so many people, especially teenagers, who will never know about different professions in this world that they would excel in. ShadowMe will change that! ShadowMe will help those in all communities and walks of life discover paths they may not have ever known were even a possibility for them. People will now be able to discover their passion and see others who have done the same. Most of all, we want to help children/teenagers in underprivileged neighborhoods realize that they have other options other than what they see around them. We want to create a world where people can envision themselves doing what they love and seeing what it takes to get there. ShadowMe will begin that process.

<li>
<strong><i>Booklet contents –</i></strong> large, colorful illustrations that explain everything at a glance, making for faster learning for everybody. We believe illustrated books are the future in STEM, for both kids and adults.</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Not a second wasted – </i></strong>Every component in the box has its name written next to it, so as you play, whether you’re taking out a part or putting it back, you’re learning the components’ names. Every second is put to good use!</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Look/Understand/Remember</i></strong> <strong><i>– </i></strong>Look at the illustrations / Understand them in a second / Anything you understand you’ll be able to remember.</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Hands-on experience –</i></strong> Once you understand, build!</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Parts arranged in the box –</i></strong> All the parts are fitted into slots and compartments inside the box. Everything is easy to take out and put back – so zero mess after playing!</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Chronology of experimenting –</i></strong> Every experiment is numbered: No. 0 Magic Light, No. 1 Timer, etc. so you always know what comes next. Each successive experiment increases the user’s knowledge.</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Packaging – </i></strong>The beautiful, sturdy box guarantees its contents will survive for many years. The magnetic flap prevents the lid from getting torn and makes the box always easy to open.</li>

<p>We believe that in the 21st century understanding robotics and electronics is as important as literacy. However, children who want to learn about robotics do not have access to adequate material. When the material contains useful knowledge, it is usually just presented with a bog-standard ‘letters on paper’ approach, which is a turnoff for both adults and children. Other materials that are adapted for kids explain trivial things, but not the specific challenges that all those who want to learn about robotics face. We need a more effective way of explaining and presenting phenomena from the fields of physics, electronics and robotics so that everyone can learn quickly and easily. <i>All About Robots</i> gives everyone the chance to learn about and understand electronics and robotics.</p>

<p align=""center""><strong>Welcome to the crowd fund launch for the brand new,</strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>SEMPI Social Communication Model!</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">Hi, my name is Alyse Price-Tobler. The last four years of my life have been dedicated to designing a completely original, ground breaking stigma reduction model for the world! I can guarantee you that there is no other model like this one anywhere, and it has the power to positively change communities!</p>
<p><strong>What is the ‘SSCM’ and why was it designed?</strong></p>
<p>SEMPI teaches community members the steps to take if someone is not OK in that very moment. The ‘SSCM’ teaches adult community members how to easily move into deeper, more empathetic conversations, enabling everyone to feel heard &amp; understood, through the acronym known as SEMPI. Each letter within the acronym SEMPI covers all aspects of daily mental and physical health in an easy to use system. Children from age three can use the specifically designed children’s model, to learn how to speak about and understand themselves. They can also gain personal insight about how their bodies and minds are feeling from an early age, thereby reducing stigma and normalising talk around mental health. Children can speak about anything they choose, be it good or not so good, in their daily routine. They can share this model with adults, or other children, allowing everyone to reciprocally have a voice and feel heard!</p>
<p align=""left"">The ‘SEMPI Social Communication Model’ has been written for ALL community members, from all walks of life! This new model teaches everyone from aged three to adult, the art of having a heart to heart conversation, so that competing with each other stops, and real listening can take place. This model is designed as a community aid to reduce loneliness, stigma, and bullying between community members, while increasing altruism through a ‘pay it forward’ philosophy.</p>
<p align=""left"">This idea matters because people need personal equality and freedom to thrive. The silence and imbalance of power within our society needs to be stopped, so that we all <strong>feel heard</strong>, validated and understood, while honouring each other.</p>
<p align=""left"">Imagine if people could learn to speak freely and honestly with a strong voice, about why they feel the way they do and what their individual needs are, while also believing that they will <strong>be heard</strong> when they do this.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>This concept has the power to change the world!</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">The ‘SEMPI Social Communication Model’ (pronounced Sem-pie) has been developed primarily with the purpose of reducing ''the tribal stigma of race, nation, and religion"" (Goffman, 1963) within our communities. ‘The SEMPI Social Communication Model’ will be known as the ‘SSCM’ for the remainder of this project.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>My background</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">I am a professional Psychotherapist/Counsellor with a Masters Degree in Psychotherapy and Counselling (MCAP). I have worked in front line Community Mental Health &amp; Disabilities, for the past 32 years. I have walked with thousands of struggling community members and I have seen a lot! These amazing souls are the reason why I get out of bed every day. My passion is deep and I am a very driven and serious advocate for many of my clients. Giving my clients a voice to feel heard and empowered is why I have written this model.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Successful track record</strong></p>
<p align=""left""> In my previous position, I was the Specialist Mental Health Disability Employment Services Area Manager for the Macarthur Region (West Sydney, Australia) for the Schizophrenia Fellowship of NSW (now known as ‘One Door.’) I created this arm of the business from scratch, to a five star rating. My position included finding, placing and supporting 200 plus clients with a mental health issue and or a disability to stay in employment with my team. I also employed and trained staff, liaised with affiliated community organisations, designed and maintained monthly budgets, advocated for our clients and worked closely with employers. I extended the initial DES contract to include a new ESS contract, bringing in another 500 clients, and making sure that the DES now had a bright future with long term viability. My proven background within the community, and my confidence in the ‘SSCM’ to be a ground-breaking new way for society to become empowered, is extremely exciting my current team and I. The ‘SSCM’ is a culmination of my 32 years of professional experience. I am not stranger to hard work, and I have heard people tell me many times what they need to be the best person that they can be, and achieve their own personal goals, especially if they have a mental health issue and or a disability. Always, time and time again, it is the NEED TO <strong>FEEL HEARD.</strong></p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Why my campaign is important to me</strong></p>
<p align=""left""><i>There is no other model like the ‘SSCM’ in the world!</i></p>
<p align=""left"">It is very clear to me, that mental illness has become more prevalent and community resources are now at breaking point! Every day, I see extreme levels of loneliness, low self-esteem and loss of hope. I see class division, segregation, judgemental behaviour, inequality, stigma, and discrimination. I have also designed the ‘SSCM’ as a preventative measure, so that we as a society do not become mentally or emotionally unwell. It is my life’s mission to change this!</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>What is the ‘SSCM’ and why was it designed?</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">The ‘SSCM’ teaches adult community members how to easily move into deeper, more empathetic conversations, enabling everyone to <strong>feel heard</strong> &amp; understood, through the acronym known as SEMPI. Each letter within the acronym SEMPI covers all aspects of daily mental and physical health in an easy to use system. Children from age three can use the specifically designed children’s model, to learn how to speak about and understand themselves. They can also gain personal insight about how their bodies and minds are feeling from an early age, thereby reducing stigma and normalising talk around mental health. Children can speak about anything they choose, be it good or not so good, in their daily routine. They can share this model with adults, or other children, allowing everyone to reciprocally have a voice and <strong>feel heard</strong>!</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>The ‘SSCM’ can also be quickly adapted to help anyone within community to know what to do if they ask someone if they're alright, and the other person answers NO. </strong></p>
<p align=""left"">This is a question that I have seen play out daily across all ages, and sections of the community. Sometimes I see people move to a deeper level and ‘hold space’ for the person answering ‘NO’, but more often than not, I see avoidance and stigma shown toward the person who has been brave enough to speak their truth.</p>
<p align=""left""><i>I asked the question, ‘do you know how to stop what you're doing, and have a deeper, more real, empathic conversation with another person, allowing them to <strong>feel heard</strong>, validated and understood, if they answer ‘NO?’</i></p>
<p align=""left"">I know from my work within community that not many people know how to comfortably address this issue. Not knowing the basic skills to take a conversation to a deeper level and sit with someone when they are needing to express themselves, often leads to communal disconnection. Communal disconnection may lead to people feeling awkward, vulnerable, isolated, unworthy, depressed, suicidal and lonely, no matter what their age or situation They may also stop answering truthfully and say the standard answer of ‘I’m good thanks’ knowing that they won’t be heard anyway. This term has also become a social norm and I am contesting it!</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Is there a better question than ‘are you alright?’</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">While I was writing the ‘SSCM’, I decided to include a new solution to the question ‘Are you alright?’ I created a whole new angle, and a brand new replacement question!</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><i>Introducing the question, ‘HOW IS YOUR SEMPI?</i></strong><strong>'</strong></p>
<p align=""center"">Replacing the question, ‘are you alright?’</p>
<p align=""left""><strong><i>'HOW IS YOUR SEMPI?'</i></strong> is a deeper, more real invitation, asked by one person to another, (between ages three to adult). This question is asked if it comes from a genuine place of interest for another person.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong><i>‘HOW IS YOUR SEMPI?’</i></strong> comes with an in built offer to take the time out to listen, and walk with the other person, consequently moving the conversation to a deeper level of empathy, care and understanding for each other’s perspectives!</p>
<p align=""left""><strong><i>‘HOW IS YOUR SEMPI?’</i></strong> is a totally unique question that no one is used to hearing, so they cannot equate it to the question ‘ARE YOU ALRIGHT?’</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>What benefits to community members will your contribution help us to achieve?</strong></p>
<p align=""left""><i>Most importantly! Knowing this model could save someone’s life!</i></p>
<p align=""left"">Members may also experience the development of closer communal bonds, reduced loneliness and depression, heightened feelings of inclusion, and higher values of self-worth. This may have a positive impact on community member’s levels of empathy and happiness. It may also influence communal policing budgets, resources allocated to health care programs, and professional community workers burn out rates. Money saved can be used to improve communities health and wellbeing overall.  </p>
<p align=""left"">The 'SSCM' is created to be an aid for the community (not a replacement for professional help). Every day, I see a HUGE gap in the area of self-care in the community due to escalating living costs and cuts to social services. This model is created with this in mind, to assist the community to work with their difficulties together, and be able to identify them early, so that their problems don't escalate to higher unmanageable levels, and community money can be better spent! </p>
<p align=""left"">The ‘SSCM’ is designed to work across all levels of stigma, including workplace stigma, mental health stigma, social class stigma, disability stigma and social stigma (physical, behavioural, intellectual and group). It teaches each person an easy to remember sequential task that they can adapt the model exactly to suit their own personal stories, and then pay it forward.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Can people with a disability use the ‘SSCM’?</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">People living with all types of disabilities can use the ‘SSCM’ to <strong>feel heard</strong>! I have used the “SSCM’ within the community to gain feedback and advice as to how to improve the model, from client’s who have downs syndrome, autism, who are experiencing homelessness, have an intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, hearing impairment and within a palliative care unit. Most of my feedback has been very positive, however, working with the prototype booklets has been challenging, but I believe that I have now created a version that works well and has all of the emergency service numbers included within the format for extra support.</p>
<p align=""left"">The ‘SSCM’ also assists the carers and nursing staff who work with the elderly, to have a voice and <strong>feel heard</strong> around the experience that is real for them as well, reducing burn out rates within this area as well.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Can professionals use the ‘SSCM?’</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">Absolutely! This model has the same format for everyone across the community, including professional workers. I include rescue personnel within this group as I was a fully accredited first responder Road Rescue Officer with the NSW State Emergency Service and I know full well what emergency responders need when it comes to <strong>feeling heard</strong>!</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>What research has been performed to validate the results of the ‘SSCM?’</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">I initially tested the ‘SSCM’ with women in Sydney who were experiencing primary homelessness, and lived with mental and physical health issues in 2016. I chose this group as they knew me well and trusted me from when I was researching my Master’s degree thesis on stigma, known as, ‘A qualitative analysis to investigate the varied responses from the female primary homeless as evident in demonstrations from the general public’ in September 2016. The response to the ‘SSCM’ was amazing from the women, and once they had learnt the model they then ‘paid it forward’ and taught the person next to them from my prototype booklets. I made changes according to their recommendations, and then went back for a review and further changes as necessary. The women reported that this model is the answer to their <strong>feeling heard</strong>, listened to, and validated. I was thrilled! We had cracked the code together!</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>What funding is needed and where is it going? </strong></p>
<p align=""left"">This project is a culmination of 32 years of my professional life and I am giving the community and children’s model away for FREE. I am making the children’s and community version FREE so that it can get out to where it’s mostly needed. However, even though it’s free for the community, it will cost a lot to get it out to where it's needed!</p>
<p align=""left""><i>We are asking for a donation of $25,000.</i></p>
<ol>
<li align=""left"">We are raising funds for an informative, professional, in depth FREE training video ($5,000) to use in accompaniment with our face to face talks for when we speak to schools and community organisations.</li>
<li align=""left"">Training and paying staff to go out into the grass roots community will cost a further $10,000.</li>
<li align=""left"">Part of the money raised will also contribute toward printing our community resource brochures ($5,000) so that they can be handed out, for free, to hospitals, community centres, libraries, work places, schools, nursing homes...basically anywhere they are needed.</li>
<li align=""left"">Day to day running of the office will consume the remaining portion of the money (phone calls, office printing, mail outs, petrol, and meals while providing training ($5,000).</li>
</ol>
<p align=""left""><strong><i>The money that we raise through our crowd fund campaign, will allow our model to be available for FREE to everyone from aged three to adult, within their communities!</i></strong></p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Where will the funds go if we don't reach our entire goal?</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">Any funds that have been kindly donated will go toward the filming of our training video so that at least we can put it up on YouTube, and what is left after that will go toward brochures for the community. We will not be able to employ staff to go out into the field and teach the model. The teaching of the model to key community personnel is imperative if we want the community members to be able to use it properly, how it was meant to be designed, for themselves.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Our unique perks! (See perk page!)</strong></p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Challenges we may face</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">With an extensive background in business and community mental health, the challenges we may face, are about a lack of money. A lack of money will lead to a major restriction on how much we can get out into the community.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Call to action!</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">We know that not everyone has the spare money to fund our project, so we would REALLY appreciate it if you could use the Indiegogo ‘share tools’ and get the word out about our free community enhancing, stigma reducing campaign! Please make as much noise as you can!</p>

‘HOW IS YOUR SEMPI?’ is a totally unique question that no one is used to hearing, so they cannot equate it to the question ‘ARE YOU ALRIGHT?’
What benefits to community members will your contribution help us to achieve?
Most importantly! Knowing this model could save someone’s life!
Members may also experience the development of closer communal bonds, reduced loneliness and depression, heightened feelings of inclusion, and higher values of self-worth. This may have a positive impact on community member’s levels of empathy and happiness. It may also influence communal policing budgets, resources allocated to health care programs, and professional community workers burn out rates. Money saved can be used to improve communities health and wellbeing overall.  
The 'SSCM' is created to be an aid for the community (not a replacement for professional help). Every day, I see a HUGE gap in the area of self-care in the community due to escalating living costs and cuts to social services. This model is created with this in mind, to assist the community to work with their difficulties together, and be able to identify them early, so that their problems don't escalate to higher unmanageable levels, and community money can be better spent! 
The ‘SSCM’ is designed to work across all levels of stigma, including workplace stigma, mental health stigma, social class stigma, disability stigma and social stigma (physical, behavioural, intellectual and group). It teaches each person an easy to remember sequential task that they can adapt the model exactly to suit their own personal stories, and then pay it forward.
Can people with a disability use the ‘SSCM’?
People living with all types of disabilities can use the ‘SSCM’ to feel heard! I have used the “SSCM’ within the community to gain feedback and advice as to how to improve the model, from client’s who have downs syndrome, autism, who are experiencing homelessness, have an intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, hearing impairment and within a palliative care unit. Most of my feedback has been very positive, however, working with the prototype booklets has been challenging, but I believe that I have now created a version that works well and has all of the emergency service numbers included within the format for extra support.
The ‘SSCM’ also assists the carers and nursing staff who work with the elderly, to have a voice and feel heard around the experience that is real for them as well, reducing burn out rates within this area as well.
Can professionals use the ‘SSCM?’
Absolutely! This model has the same format for everyone across the community, including professional workers. I include rescue personnel within this group as I was a fully accredited first responder Road Rescue Officer with the NSW State Emergency Service and I know full well what emergency responders need when it comes to feeling heard!
What research has been performed to validate the results of the ‘SSCM?’
I initially tested the ‘SSCM’ with women in Sydney who were experiencing primary homelessness, and lived with mental and physical health issues in 2016. I chose this group as they knew me well and trusted me from when I was researching my Master’s degree thesis on stigma, known as, ‘A qualitative analysis to investigate the varied responses from the female primary homeless as evident in demonstrations from the general public’ in September 2016. The response to the ‘SSCM’ was amazing from the women, and once they had learnt the model they then ‘paid it forward’ and taught the person next to them from my prototype booklets. I made changes according to their recommendations, and then went back for a review and further changes as necessary. The women reported that this model is the answer to their feeling heard, listened to, and validated. I was thrilled! We had cracked the code together!
What funding is needed and where is it going? 
This project is a culmination of 32 years of my professional life and I am giving the community and children’s model away for FREE. I am making the children’s and community version FREE so that it can get out to where it’s mostly needed. However, even though it’s free for the community, it will cost a lot to get it out to where it's needed!
We are asking for a donation of $25,000.

We are raising funds for an informative, professional, in depth FREE training video ($5,000) to use in accompaniment with our face to face talks for when we speak to schools and community organisations.
Training and paying staff to go out into the grass roots community will cost a further $10,000.
Part of the money raised will also contribute toward printing our community resource brochures ($5,000) so that they can be handed out, for free, to hospitals, community centres, libraries, work places, schools, nursing homes...basically anywhere they are needed.
Day to day running of the office will consume the remaining portion of the money (phone calls, office printing, mail outs, petrol, and meals while providing training ($5,000).

The money that we raise through our crowd fund campaign, will allow our model to be available for FREE to everyone from aged three to adult, within their communities!
Where will the funds go if we don't reach our entire goal?
Any funds that have been kindly donated will go toward the filming of our training video so that at least we can put it up on YouTube, and what is left after that will go toward brochures for the community. We will not be able to employ staff to go out into the field and teach the model. The teaching of the model to key community personnel is imperative if we want the community members to be able to use it properly, how it was meant to be designed, for themselves.
Our unique perks! (See perk page!)
Challenges we may face
With an extensive background in business and community mental health, the challenges we may face, are about a lack of money. A lack of money will lead to a major restriction on how much we can get out into the community.
Call to action!
We know that not everyone has the spare money to fund our project, so we would REALLY appreciate it if you could use the Indiegogo ‘share tools’ and get the word out about our free community enhancing, stigma reducing campaign! Please make as much noise as you can!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The 12 hour drive to University of Maine this summer brought tears to my eyes.  Yes, I cried ...lol.  I was happy for my son, Isaiah, because he truly earned his football scholarship.  However, the long drive allowed me to reflect on the struggles of our journey.  When I shared my feelings with my business partner James Burrell, he told me about his personal journey as a Division 1 basketball player and that of his daughter who is currently a track star at Fresno State.  I know what you are thinking…. We should be happy that our children were lucky enough to be in that top 1% of high school athletes to receive a college scholarship.</p>
<p>After hours of conversation, it hit us like a ton of bricks.  SmartJock!! There are millions and millions of families just like ours dedicating so much time, energy, and money into sports and will not realize the impact of that time being taking away from education until it’s too late.  SmartJock will create the culture to make it cool to be smart.</p>

<h2><strong>Who We Are:</strong></h2>
<p>Ellen and Julienne became friends through mutual passion for Permaculture practices, and work together to proceed forward toward self-sufficient livelihoods that benefit the person, plant, animal, insect, air, water and soil communities around them.<br/><br/>Ellen grew up in the mountains of western NC with a strong love and connection to the land, and after 15 years dreaming about having a homestead, finally began to see it come to fruition beginning in 2015 with the purchase of 5 acres in Haywood County. Ellen's experience stems from lots of book learning, some years spent working for a plant nursery and garden center, years working in the natural health/food industry and studying nutrition in school, years spent volunteering with a group of Food Not Bombs towards helping alleviate hunger in urban food desert neighborhoods, in addition to WWOOFing and other workshops related to Permaculture and other sustainable agriculture modalities.<br/><br/>Julienne grew up in/around farming communities in PA. After going to school for environmental studies and becoming discouraged at the rate in which our civilization at large on this planet is destroying the planet's ecosystems faster than the rate at which they can recover, she decided the best way she felt she could make a direct impact on sustaining and preserving life on the planet would be to strive towards living with a lighter foot print, and permaculture practices became the framework in which to do so. She left school to travel around the country living with various intentional communities learning hands-on sustainable farming skills and how humans can have a more positive impact on one another and the earth we all share.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Way Forward:</h2>
<p>North Carolina is ranked as one of the worst regions for food desertification in the country - there are over 380 determined food deserts across 80 counties. Many of the state's inhabitants still live in rural areas and yet have stopped farming and gardening as the generations carried on, or they have no time to do so when they have to drive however far just to get to their place of employment. This means that many people live without easy access to affordable or healthy foods.<br/>Statistically the median age range of farmers in this country is currently 55 and getting older. We face the potential of a dying profession, one which no country can afford to lose if it seeks to feed all of its people. Within the past few years there has been a small revival of sorts, as many young people try to break into the business, preserving this way of life and even improving upon it, yet many budding young farmers are a generation or two removed from farming families and come to the profession with no life-long learned skill or farmland inheritance. Getting started in farming isnt easy, getting started coming into it from nothing and with nothing makes it exceedingly difficult for this good and important work to continue on successfully, even by those willing to carry the torch.<br/>Still, statistics seem to be on our side, the percentage of women-owned farms is growing, the interest level in agricultural practices that go against the mono-crop, industrial agriculture grain is also on the rise (all puns intended). We seek to definitely be an active part of the change we wish to see in the world. We wish to continually learn ever more so we can be at our most proficient, as well as be able to share our knowledge to help others lead more sustainable and healthy lives as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Means:</h2>
<p>The Asheville Organic Growers school came into existence out of the recognition and understanding that some sort of help and training needed to be facilitated in order to support young people exploring how they could viably get into a sustainable farming enterprise. Their short weekend long workshops have garnered much success and pull together some of the highest caliber teachers in western North Carolina in matters of sustainable agriculture, homesteading, green building, food rights and policy etc... Last year they launched the first round of their Farm Beginnings year long training program designed for the start-up farmers who are just getting their feet wet and needing an extra framework for guidance towards success. Now it has come time for the second run of the program to choose its students.</p>
<p><a href=""http://organicgrowersschool.org/farm-beginnings/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://organicgrowersschool.org/farm-beginnings/</a></p>
<p><br/>Ellen and Julienne see this as an invaluable opportunity to learn more about business start up and management in farming from local experts already walking the walk and talking the talk. It is a networking and educational opportunity wherein the content of the program far exceeds the more than fair price asked to register and join in.</p>
<p>Alas, being young start-ups, even this relatively meager tuition total of $2500 is not something we have lying around. To pay for this training program will necessitate debt on both of our parts, and while debt may be virtually just part of our ""way of life"" getting by in this country, the less we must place ourselves in financial debt now, so early out the starting gate into this world of farming, the better off we will be to launch our enterprise off the ground in the months and years to come.<br/><br/>Any and all help provided is most graciously appreciated. Any funds we can raise will go towards affording this program's tuition.</p>

Within the past few years there has been a small revival of sorts, as many young people try to break into the business, preserving this way of life and even improving upon it, yet many budding young farmers are a generation or two removed from farming families and come to the profession with no life-long learned skill or farmland inheritance. Getting started in farming isnt easy, getting started coming into it from nothing and with nothing makes it exceedingly difficult for this good and important work to continue on successfully, even by those willing to carry the torch.Still, statistics seem to be on our side, the percentage of women-owned farms is growing, the interest level in agricultural practices that go against the mono-crop, industrial agriculture grain is also on the rise (all puns intended). We seek to definitely be an active part of the change we wish to see in the world. We wish to continually learn ever more so we can be at our most proficient, as well as be able to share our knowledge to help others lead more sustainable and healthy lives as well.
 
The Means:
The Asheville Organic Growers school came into existence out of the recognition and understanding that some sort of help and training needed to be facilitated in order to support young people exploring how they could viably get into a sustainable farming enterprise. Their short weekend long workshops have garnered much success and pull together some of the highest caliber teachers in western North Carolina in matters of sustainable agriculture, homesteading, green building, food rights and policy etc... Last year they launched the first round of their Farm Beginnings year long training program designed for the start-up farmers who are just getting their feet wet and needing an extra framework for guidance towards success. Now it has come time for the second run of the program to choose its students.
http://organicgrowersschool.org/farm-beginnings/
Ellen and Julienne see this as an invaluable opportunity to learn more about business start up and management in farming from local experts already walking the walk and talking the talk. It is a networking and educational opportunity wherein the content of the program far exceeds the more than fair price asked to register and join in.
Alas, being young start-ups, even this relatively meager tuition total of $2500 is not something we have lying around. To pay for this training program will necessitate debt on both of our parts, and while debt may be virtually just part of our ""way of life"" getting by in this country, the less we must place ourselves in financial debt now, so early out the starting gate into this world of farming, the better off we will be to launch our enterprise off the ground in the months and years to come.Any and all help provided is most graciously appreciated. Any funds we can raise will go towards affording this program's tuition.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>The
technology behind BodiBeacon has been available for about a year,
but never applied quite this way before. Most
other beacons on the market work through outdated GPS technology,
which only operates through direct line of site with the device on a
very limited range. Breaking line of sight can instantly invalidate
everything the beacon has to offer. Tracking with GPS can also be
wildly inaccurate. This obviously won’t work when dealing with lost
children. GPS also relies on a SIM card and contract with a provider,
making the whole thing
unnecessarily expensive and complicated to use.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1005840/files/20141111124705-img3.jpg?1415738825"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Any item equipped with
our beacon will be paired with a mobile device with its own specialty
app installed. It will constantly transmit a signal through low
energy Bluetooth technology to track its location. Because the device
is small enough to be integrated into everyday items like clothes and
jewelry, the child will not even know he or she is wearing it, and any
person with harmful intent would not know to remove it.

<p>When she started college, we could not find nationally available college scholarships specifically for kids like her -- students with Tourette Syndrome.

<p>Since there were no scholarships for kids with TS, we decided to start a family foundation to provide college scholarships as financial encouragement for students with Tourette Syndrome to attend and complete college --and as an investment in their future contributions to society. </p>
<p>Kelsey earned her Education degree and has become a teacher. She's making a difference, and now, we want to help other students with Tourette Syndrome do the same - by making it easier to attend college.  We believe in the potential of TS scholars!</p>

Your eyes start to water, your nose gets itchy, and your brain even has time to think - ""I'm about to sneeze!"" And there's not much you can do to stop it. That's the best way we know how to describe how a person with Tourette Syndrome (TS) feels when a tic is about to come on. Can you imagine being a college student, in class, or studying in the library, dealing with constant vocal or motor tics that keep you from focusing?
College students with Tourette Syndrome (TS) have enough distractions without worrying about college costs. Dollars 4 Tic Scholars is a brand new non-profit established to help kids with TS  attend college and stay in college. 



My daughter, Kelsey Diamantis, has Tourette Syndrome. 



When she started college, we could not find nationally available college scholarships specifically for kids like her -- students with Tourette Syndrome. With the learning challenges these students face due to distractions from tics, plus potential associated conditions including OCD and ADHD, these students deserve many different types of support and encouragement. 
Since there were no scholarships for kids with TS, we decided to start a family foundation to provide college scholarships as financial encouragement for students with Tourette Syndrome to attend and complete college --and as an investment in their future contributions to society. 
Kelsey earned her Education degree and has become a teacher. She's making a difference, and now, we want to help other students with Tourette Syndrome do the same - by making it easier to attend college.  We believe in the potential of TS scholars!


We are raising funds to award our first scholarships in 2015. We are very enthusiastic about providing a service that many are seeking. But as a small, new foundation, we need your help. Do you know someone who has Tourette Syndrome? Then you know how important this financial encouragement is. Please read through our page and help.

   What We Need & What You Get Through our scholarships, we will encourage students with Tourette Syndrome to pursue a degree, regardless of the learning difficulties they will face.

So far, our organization has been self funded and supported by donations of family and friends. However, this is not going to be enough. We need scholarship funding as well as minimal amounts for continuing operations - fundraising and communications to spread the word about our new foundation.

-- For 2015, we plan to award between one and four scholarships in the amount of $1000 each. Our goal in the next five years is to be able to provide 16 $1000 scholarships per year. Scholarships are designated for tuition, books and fees.

<p>Exponential Education started with a mission to help provide education and resources to students in need.

Those younger students not only gained crucial math and English skills, but also confidence, role models, and mentors. </p>
<p>What started as a backyard pilot program has transformed into a full-fledged operation. Currently, Exponential Education has a volunteer staff of 12 on the

LEAP) and vocational training programs (Expo BUILD), and we make sure to monitor and evaluate our efforts through rigorous methods which prove the efficacy of our programs. Now that we have evidence, a staff, and a portfolio of programs, we are ready and excited to scale. </p>
<p>This year we are aiming to raise $40,000 USD through combined fundraising platforms in order to expand our programs. These funds

<h3>The Field Trip</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>For the last 18 years, students from the Bolinas-Stinson Beach School’s
7th grade class have journeyed to Utah's San Rafael Swell for the purpose of studying Earth’s dynamic history. This interdisciplinary program has become a distinguishing feature of the school's science curriculum and gives students a unique learning experience, far removed from the confines of a normal classroom. Led by their teacher Don Jolley, students explore geology in Utah and parts of Nevada and Wyoming. </p>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span>
<p>Roughly following the route navigated by Clarence King during his 1876 ""Survey of the Fortieth Parallel,"" students will study the diverse layers of earth deposited over millions of years and the various forms of life dating back to the time when dinosaurs inhabited the landscape.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As they travel the 1800 mile trip, students examine the extensive geologic record,  explore sediments from the Mesozoic Era, prospect
for fossil deposits, study ancient pictographs on sandstone walls, and map a dinosaur
track-way near Arches national Park. Although most of their stay will be
within the San Rafael Swell near Moab Utah, the route begins at the University of Nevada in Reno and finishes north at Wyoming's Fossil Butte where students will quarry for fish
fossils from the world renowned Green River Formation.</p>

One of the biggest challenges of this project is to convince the people of the city of its importance and that this should be done by them and for them. Strategies to motivate the community will be implemented to solve this.
Otro aspecto a tomar en cuenta es la normativa y legislación nacional para lo cual desde la misma comunidad deberán realizarse los análisis y estudios necesarios para actuar dentro de la legalidad nacional.
Another aspect to consider is the law and national legislation which from the same community analyzes and studies needed to act within the national legislation should be made.
Como en cualquier red informática los riesgos de seguridad deben ser tomados en cuenta, para esto se establecerán mecanismos de protección que cumplan con las normas y estándares de calidad nacionales e internacionales de seguridad de redes inalámbricas.
As in any computer network security risks must be taken into account, for this will be established protection mechanisms that comply with the rules and standards of quality national and international security on wireless networks.

For people missing an upper-limb, lack of a prosthetic is a major disability that affects their quality of life. Everyday tasks such as tying shoelaces, eating with a knife and fork, or using a zipper, are difficult for amputees. Missing limbs can lead to social exclusion, and difficulty in gaining meaningful employment. In developing countries, the availability of prosthetic devices is extremely limited, yet the demand there is the greatest. The Victoria Hand Project (VHP) is focused on getting prosthetic hands to those amputees who need them. We’ve designed a low-cost, high-function, customized, 3D printed upper-limb prosthesis system. It’s specifically designed for production in developing countries where it’s needed. With our prosthetic hand, amputees can regain function, improve their quality of life, and may have better access to employment opportunities.</span><br/></p>

As well, the fingers and thumb are rubber-tipped to help grasp smaller objects. The prosthesis has an adjustable ball-and-socket wrist, to orient the hand to various postures. The wrist is easy and intuitive to use and gives the amputee ability to perform many different tasks. Since all people are unique, we use 3D laser scanning to capture the distinctive anatomy of an amputee’s limb, allowing for production of a custom 3D printed limb-socket. This provides a comfortable fit, and allows amputees to wear the device all day to perform their daily living needs.</span></p>

Right now, amputees in Guatemala and Nepal must wait for donated, second-hand parts to receive a prosthesis, sometimes waiting for months. Purchasing new, traditional prosthetic systems from western nations is far too expensive for most people. By producing the Victoria Hand in-country using 3D printing and 3D laser scanning, amputees can receive a prosthesis within days of being measured.

VHP will also employ and train a full-time 3D printing technician from the local community. Our clinical partners provide the clinic space and staff, the clinical fitting expertise, and local care networks. VHP funds the equivalent of one half-time clinician – helping to increase clinic capacity – and provides ongoing technical support to both the print center and the clinic. </p><p>Amputees in need of a prosthesis will approach the clinic first. A professionally trained prosthetist will greet and register them, assess their needs, and cast a plaster impression of their limb. The plaster mold impression along with the amputee’s measurements, are sent to the Print Center where the technician scans the mold using a 3D laser scanner. They then 3D print the prosthesis parts, assemble them, and deliver the completed prosthesis back to the clinic. The clinician fits the amputee, and teaches them to use their new 3D printed prosthesis system. In about one week, an amputee gets a device to help improve their quality of life!

Everyday tasks such as tying shoelaces, eating with a knife and fork, or using a zipper, are difficult for amputees. Missing limbs can lead to social exclusion, and difficulty in gaining meaningful employment. In developing countries, the availability of prosthetic devices is extremely limited, yet the demand there is the greatest. The Victoria Hand Project (VHP) is focused on getting prosthetic hands to those amputees who need them. We’ve designed a low-cost, high-function, customized, 3D printed upper-limb prosthesis system. It’s specifically designed for production in developing countries where it’s needed. With our prosthetic hand, amputees can regain function, improve their quality of life, and may have better access to employment opportunities.





The Victoria Hand is a complete body-powered prosthesis consisting of a hand, a wrist, a limb-socket, and a harness. It has high functionality, natural-appearance, and is custom-made to fit each amputee.


The hand is capable of adaptive grasp, which allows the fingers and thumb to conform around the shape of various objects, creating a secure grip. As well, the fingers and thumb are rubber-tipped to help grasp smaller objects. The prosthesis has an adjustable ball-and-socket wrist, to orient the hand to various postures. The wrist is easy and intuitive to use and gives the amputee ability to perform many different tasks. Since all people are unique, we use 3D laser scanning to capture the distinctive anatomy of an amputee’s limb, allowing for production of a custom 3D printed limb-socket. This provides a comfortable fit, and allows amputees to wear the device all day to perform their daily living needs.




Most importantly, the Victoria Hand is specifically designed for low-cost production and distribution within the countries where it’s needed. Right now, amputees in Guatemala and Nepal must wait for donated, second-hand parts to receive a prosthesis, sometimes waiting for months. Purchasing new, traditional prosthetic systems from western nations is far too expensive for most people. By producing the Victoria Hand in-country using 3D printing and 3D laser scanning, amputees can receive a prosthesis within days of being measured. This groundbreaking prosthesis solution will improve the quality of life of many thousands of amputees in the developing world.          We need your help to provide 100+ amputees with upper-limb prosthetic care in Guatemala and Nepal! In order to do this, we’ve set a $94,000 goal to create the needed infrastructure to deliver this prosthetic care. It includes enough money for the prosthesis materials, the equipment, the training, and the staff resources to fit 100 amputees. Once the Print Centers and Partner Clinics are established in Guatemala and Nepal, they can continue to serve many more additional amputees (beyond the 100) for only $320 each!         
Your
donations will help to:
Empower 100 amputees who previously had no prosthesis to achieve a better quality of life
Provide 50 amputees in Guatemala, and 50 amputees in Nepal, with a complete 3D printed prosthesis system at no cost to them
Establish a Print Center and fund a Partner Clinic in Zacapa, Guatemala
Establish a Print Center and fund a Partner Clinic in Kathmandu, Nepal
Employ and train regional persons to 3D scan, 3D print, and assemble prostheses

Establish the base-infrastructure in these countries, so they can help hundreds more amputees in the future (beyond the 100) for only $320 per system

Transfer leading edge technology and skills to developing countries, to help give them new economic opportunities

For more information, keep reading below!Making 3D printed prosthetics is only half the story. The great challenge is getting them directly to the people who need them. This is where our solution really makes a difference. We have partnered with dedicated and experienced prosthetic care providers, Range of Motion Project (ROMP) in Guatemala, and the Nepal Orthopedic Hospital (NOH) in Nepal. This means we can reach those in need.Starting with Guatemala and Nepal, a Print Center and Partner Clinic will be created in each country. It works like this: VHP establishes a 3D Print Center, equipping it with all the technology and tools necessary to make 3D printed prosthetics. VHP will also employ and train a full-time 3D printing technician from the local community. Our clinical partners provide the clinic space and staff, the clinical fitting expertise, and local care networks. VHP funds the equivalent of one half-time clinician – helping to increase clinic capacity – and provides ongoing technical support to both the print center and the clinic. Amputees in need of a prosthesis will approach the clinic first. A professionally trained prosthetist will greet and register them, assess their needs, and cast a plaster impression of their limb. The plaster mold impression along with the amputee’s measurements, are sent to the Print Center where the technician scans the mold using a 3D laser scanner. They then 3D print the prosthesis parts, assemble them, and deliver the completed prosthesis back to the clinic. The clinician fits the amputee, and teaches them to use their new 3D printed prosthesis system. In about one week, an amputee gets a device to help improve their quality of life! Our solution supports local economies, provides training, and transfers exciting technology to developing countries.There is nothing more important than the quality of the prosthetic device and the care that each amputee receives. We are proud to partner with skilled clinicians to have our prosthetic professionally fit to amputees.
“Amputees are not disabled by a missing limb, but by a missing prosthesis.” - ROMP
Established in 2005 by David Krupa, Eric Neufeld, and headed by Patrick Mathay, ROMP supplies prosthetic and orthotic care to people who would not otherwise have access in the United States, Mexico, Ecuador, and Guatemala.  ROMP realizes that prosthetics are devices of empowerment and employs a strategy of clinical care, local investment, and advocacy. (www.rompglobal.org)
Established in 1998, the Nepal Orthopedic Hospital (NOH) provides quality orthopaedic care at an affordable price.  In a country with no health insurance system NOH is committed to providing charitable care to those who can least afford it.  During the continuing aftermath of the 2015 Nepal earthquake, NOH has treated all patients free of cost.
Presently, millions of people in developing countries do not have access to prosthetic care because of economic status and limited availability of components.

The Victoria Hand Project team and our Clinical Partners believe that all people should have access to prosthetic care regardless of their ability to pay. This crowdfunding campaign will provide enough resources to produce and fit 100 amputees with a complete prosthesis system free of charge.  Beyond these 100 amputees, we are exploring new ways to fund the $320/amputee amount needed for additional prostheses. All efforts will be made to serve every amputee through our Print Centers and Partner Clinics, regardless of their ability to pay.
Donations like yours will help to provide the prosthetic care infrastructure needed in developing nations. Equally important is working towards a sustainable care model. Our sustainability model proposes that the 3D printing and scanning equipment be used for revenue generation during off-hours, since it has numerous external applications. Local community users will be taught valuable 3D printing and 3D scanning skills so that they can produce parts for the repair of equipment, and provide training for local schools and colleges.

be spent.  Our $94,000 campaign goal has
been allocated to maximize the impact of your donations.

<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1278158/files/20150308101857-young_congolese.png?1425835137"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We want to
make a difference in the life of unemployed young people in Kinshasa in the
next six months. These young people have high potential and are very dynamic,
yet they are not given the opportunity to deploy their potential and be actors
of the social and economic development of their community. We believe that every
young woman and man in every corner of the DRC deserves to be given an
opportunity to learn new skills that will prepare them to enter the 21<sup>st</sup>
century workplace. It is estimated that more than 7 million young women and men
aged 18-24 in DRC are either jobless or underemployed. This has to change. In
order to boost the economic and social development of Congo through its youth
by 2030, after more than 20 years of war, it is important that we start acting <b>NOW</b>. The contribution that we make,
regardless of its size, will always make a difference. The Bridge Initiative
promotes volunteerism and social entrepreneurship as pathways for youth
employment.<span>  </span>We harness the power of social
innovation to reduce youth unemployment in DRC by building the capacity of
young people and placing them on volunteer assignments for social impact. 

<p><b>The Need</b></p>
<p>More than
80% of universities and schools in Congo <b>lack
adequate career services</b> to link students to potential employers. The
priority of the Bridge Project right now is to partner with universities and
schools in order to prepare students as well as to answer to the immediate
needs of youth who are still in school, those who finish high school and want
to <b>increase their skills and experience</b>
through volunteerism, social entrepreneurship and access to mentors, before
they decide to continue their studies at higher education, on one hand, and
those who have recently graduated from university and are still struggling to
find a decent job, on the other hand. These two categories of youth have the
potential to actively participate to the social and economic development of
their community, but they lack the skills, experience and opportunity. There is
a need to be fulfilled. There is a gap to be filled. There is a Bridge to be
built in order <b>to fill the skills and
opportunity gap</b>, and the Bridge Initiative is doing just that: trying to
fill the skills and opportunity gap.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1278167/files/20150308102220-bridging_the_gap.png?1425835340"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Our Solution</b></p>
<p><b><u>What we’ve done so far</u></b>: Since last
year we are making a difference in young people’s lives through our career
development center by increasing their skills and experience through our career
readiness workshops and upcoming volunteer opportunities for young people. In
just a few months since the official launch of the Bridge Initiative, we have
raised awareness on volunteerism and social entrepreneurship in Kinshasa,
recruited more than 50 young people aged 18-30, and now we are helping them to prepare
and be ready for a meaningful career in the next two years. We have also talked
to potential partner organisations that have accepted to host these young people
on stipend-based volunteer assignments after the career readiness workshops, in
order to give them the opportunity to increase their experience and
employability. We want to reach more
young people in the next six months and make a higher impact.</p>
<p><b><u>What we hope to do in the next six months</u></b>:
We hope to introduce our curriculum in one of the largest universities in
Kinshasa and one high school, namely the Université Catholique au Congo, and
the Samuel Levi School, in order to reach more high school and university students.
We also want to start a youth café where young people will have networking
opportunities with mentors and potential employers. A big screen will be placed
in the youth café, and young people will have the opportunity to watch relevant
Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) while having a drink or eating something.</p>
<p><b>What we need</b></p>
<p>We need <b>15,000$</b> to change the lives of youth in
universities and schools by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Increasing the experience and employability of 100
more young people in Kinshasa through skills development and volunteer
opportunities. </p></li>
<li><p>Increasing access for youths to mentors to foster entrepreneurship
and career skills; </p></li>
<li><p>Increasing access for youths to the labor market
information, mentors and career resources.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>We are incredibly
cost-effective. Our administrative costs are only 5%. All of our staff are
volunteers. Besides, our project implementation costs are already covered by
our donors. Every dollar you give will be used for scaling up our initiative
and printing more career readiness workshop materials. The money will also
contribute to youth volunteer stipends during their placement. </b></p>
<p><b>What difference your contribution will make</b></p>
<p>We are building workshop
materials and presentations that our 50 young people and mentors like, and we
need your help to bring our career readiness workshops to a school and a
university in Kinshasa in order to reach  more young people in the next six months. We believe that our project will be successful and will

Jean-Marc Mercy. I am the CEO and co-founder of the Bridge Initiative
(www.thebridge-initiative.org), a social enterprise that promotes volunteerism
and social entrepreneurship as pathways to decent employment of young people. The
Bridge Initiative is based in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.

Context
We want to
make a difference in the life of unemployed young people in Kinshasa in the
next six months. These young people have high potential and are very dynamic,
yet they are not given the opportunity to deploy their potential and be actors
of the social and economic development of their community. We believe that every
young woman and man in every corner of the DRC deserves to be given an
opportunity to learn new skills that will prepare them to enter the 21st
century workplace. It is estimated that more than 7 million young women and men
aged 18-24 in DRC are either jobless or underemployed. This has to change. In
order to boost the economic and social development of Congo through its youth
by 2030, after more than 20 years of war, it is important that we start acting NOW. The contribution that we make,
regardless of its size, will always make a difference. The Bridge Initiative
promotes volunteerism and social entrepreneurship as pathways for youth
employment.  We harness the power of social
innovation to reduce youth unemployment in DRC by building the capacity of
young people and placing them on volunteer assignments for social impact. 

The Need
More than
80% of universities and schools in Congo lack
adequate career services to link students to potential employers. The
priority of the Bridge Project right now is to partner with universities and
schools in order to prepare students as well as to answer to the immediate
needs of youth who are still in school, those who finish high school and want
to increase their skills and experience
through volunteerism, social entrepreneurship and access to mentors, before
they decide to continue their studies at higher education, on one hand, and
those who have recently graduated from university and are still struggling to
find a decent job, on the other hand. These two categories of youth have the
potential to actively participate to the social and economic development of
their community, but they lack the skills, experience and opportunity. There is
a need to be fulfilled. There is a gap to be filled. There is a Bridge to be
built in order to fill the skills and
opportunity gap, and the Bridge Initiative is doing just that: trying to
fill the skills and opportunity gap.
Our Solution
What we’ve done so far: Since last
year we are making a difference in young people’s lives through our career
development center by increasing their skills and experience through our career
readiness workshops and upcoming volunteer opportunities for young people. In
just a few months since the official launch of the Bridge Initiative, we have
raised awareness on volunteerism and social entrepreneurship in Kinshasa,
recruited more than 50 young people aged 18-30, and now we are helping them to prepare
and be ready for a meaningful career in the next two years. We have also talked
to potential partner organisations that have accepted to host these young people
on stipend-based volunteer assignments after the career readiness workshops, in
order to give them the opportunity to increase their experience and
employability. We want to reach more
young people in the next six months and make a higher impact.
What we hope to do in the next six months:
We hope to introduce our curriculum in one of the largest universities in
Kinshasa and one high school, namely the Université Catholique au Congo, and
the Samuel Levi School, in order to reach more high school and university students.
We also want to start a youth café where young people will have networking
opportunities with mentors and potential employers. A big screen will be placed
in the youth café, and young people will have the opportunity to watch relevant
Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) while having a drink or eating something.
What we need
We need 15,000$ to change the lives of youth in
universities and schools by:

Increasing the experience and employability of 100
more young people in Kinshasa through skills development and volunteer
opportunities. 
Increasing access for youths to mentors to foster entrepreneurship
and career skills; 
Increasing access for youths to the labor market
information, mentors and career resources.

We are incredibly
cost-effective. Our administrative costs are only 5%. All of our staff are
volunteers. Besides, our project implementation costs are already covered by
our donors. Every dollar you give will be used for scaling up our initiative
and printing more career readiness workshop materials. The money will also
contribute to youth volunteer stipends during their placement. 
What difference your contribution will make
We are building workshop
materials and presentations that our 50 young people and mentors like, and we
need your help to bring our career readiness workshops to a school and a
university in Kinshasa in order to reach  more young people in the next six months. We believe that our project will be successful and will
have an impact nationwide. The Bridge Initiative was recognized at the 10th Annual Meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in New York  as one of the 7 winning ideas of the Youth Employment Challenge that was launched on OpenIdeo (www.openideo.com). Your support will provide in-person training

<span>In Ali's words:</span><p>When I first visited the Sinai School at the age of thirteen, I immediately knew that my life was going to change. Little did I know how much. I have now traveled to Babati five times and, throughout these journeys, I have gained a little sister in Arafa, an extended family on the other side of the world, and a passion for empowerment through education. Arafa has truly inspired so many people, both in the US and in Tanzania. I am so thankful that she is part of my life, and to all of the people who have made made it possible thus far. I have grown to care so much for her and all of the students at the Sinai School, and<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> I want opportunities (like those of the scholarships) to remain possible.</span></p>

<h2>What Your Donated Funds Will Cover:</h2>
<h3>1st Priority:  School Fees</h3>
<p>Hawthorne Valley School donated a five year scholarship to Arafa, allowing her to complete eighth grade and four years of High School.  Arafa's school fees for High School are $2,500 per year. (total $10,000).  </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 30px;"">2nd Priority:  Summer School and Tutoring</span></p>
<p>Although Arafa's English improves everyday, she needs help to fill some gaps in her primarily education and improve her English.  She now understands and speaks fluently, but needs tutoring and summer programs to assist her English skills.  We'd also like to hire a computer and math tutor.  $2,000 per year. (total $8,000)</p>
<h3>3rd Priority:  Arafa's Direct Expenses </h3>
<p>When Arafa came to upstate New York, she'd never owned a winter coat or a textbook.  Arafa loves sports and is a talented athlete, member of the soccer team and interested in swimming, dance and theater.  She also calls home to her family every Sunday. Her current host family generously provides room and board and more importantly their love and support.  $2,000 per year. (total $6,000)</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 30px;"">4th Priority: Educating Girls, Inspiring Excellence</span></p>
<p>Sinai Scholars - We've been working with the Sinai school for over seven years and the selection of one student to study in the New York was balanced with the unmet needs of all children graduating.  There are approximately 100 Sinai students each year who graduate 7th grade and can't afford secondary school or lack access to quality secondary education.  Working with community leaders, we put in place selection criteria to choose one boy and one girl to attend a private school in Tanzania - cost $1,000 per year (including room and board).    At full strength, the program requites $9,000 per year.  (total for 2 years - $18,000)</p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>5th Priority: Bicycles for Babati Secondary Scholars</h3>
<p>Sinai Scholars - A program inspired by our daughter Grace, who saved her change for one year to help Arafa.  This was enough to fund 10 bicycles for the graduating 7th year primary students (12-13 years old).  The public secondary school is located over ten kilometers away, without water or electricity.  The bicycle program provides transportation, and inspiration for the the three years prior to graduation for the students to study and perform.  Many students, especially girls end their education at age 13 because it is difficult to get to school.  This helps. $800 per year (total $2,400).</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 30px;"">6th Priority:  Arafa's Travel to be Home for Ramadan </span><br/></p>
<p>We don't let Arafa travel alone, but will volunteer our time and expenses, including our airfare to accompany her.  The average airfare to Tanzania is $1,750 in the summer and her village is several hours from the airport.  $2,000 per year (total $8,000).</p>
<h3><b>Always A Priority - Sinai School Girls</b></h3>
<div><b>There are multiple projects that need support and our goal is to make them sustainable.  The girls are in need of new latrines, washrooms and while the school now has water, solar panels would help reduce the cost of the pump.</b></div>
<div><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; line-height: 30px;"">Total: $50,400  (will cover programs until 2018)</b></div>
<p><b>Funds raised in excess of our goal are needed and we commit to spend them on continued support of Arafa and the Sinai Scholars and in particular, supporting the education of girls.  The Sinai school is in desperate need of new latrines / toilets for the girls as well as books.  We aim to install solar panels to decrease electricity costs next summer.  If at all possible, we'd like to make it possible for all Sinai students to gain access to secondary education.  We remain open to questions and accountable, and welcome volunteers for current and future projects.  Our Commitment to You: Every dollar donated will be put to the use stated here and for the education of Arafa and the children of Babati.  If you'd like to provide us your email, we will send regular updates and keep you informed of the students' and Arafa's progress to graduation from High School and beyond.</b></p>

</div></div>","The Education of Arafa and the Sinai Scholars Program, Babati, TanzaniaWhen Arafa's father Jumanne gave permission for Arafa to leave her village in Tanzania and travel to the United States, he told her ""be like an open door for other girls to pass through."" Arafa - only 13 years old then, has worked hard, and is indeed living up to that blessing and challenge. She is now in ninth grade and on track to graduate with her class in 2018. We need help to keep the door open for Arafa and open doors for girls to get quality secondary education in Tanzania.  THIS FUNDRAISER WILL BE THE ONLY ONE FOR ARAFA AND THE SINAI SCHOLARS PROGRAM TO REACH THE END OF THEIR HIGH SCHOOL - end of 2018!
This November, 2013 picture is at the doorway of Arafa's home in Babati, next to the Sinai school.  I am speaking with Arafa, her mother Tatu and father Jumanne are in the doorway (holding on to her 2 year old brother Omari), and a Hawthorne Valley student Ali Reinhold is kneeling next to Arafa's sister, Sabrina (who is now a 1st grader at Sinai school).  On this trip, Arafa was Skype interviewed by the Hawthorne Valley School and a formal acceptance letter was sent the next day.Arafa's Commitment to You - In Her Own WordsI promise to study hard and to be kind.  I will stay grateful every day.  I miss home but I need this chance.  I want this chance and know one day I'm gong to change the world.My husband and I founded WaterPowerPeace, a sister school initiative that connects schools and students in the United States with schools in Tanzania.  We launched the program by building a playground that generates power, able to pump clean water and provide lights and charging ability for a school in the developing world.  I met Arafa in 2008 when she was 7 years old, a student at the Sinai School Primary School, in Babati, Tanzania. She became my daughter Grace's pen pal.On our first visit to Sinai school, the ""round trip"" to the nearest water source was over one mile - it didn't have a sanitary seal, flooded and was shared by many users.  The children ages 4 - 13, lost hours of class time walking for water each day.  The school didn't have electricity, kindergarten classroom, teacher training, gardens or books.  We selected the Sinai school for our pilot program because of kids like Arafa - the 900 Sinai school students had something special - curiosity, problem solving, joy, and a love of school.  The Sinai school happened to have a devoted principal, Mr. Walter, involved parents and dedicated teachers.  They lacked resources but were rich in the qualities we felt mattered: trust, integrity, work ethic and optimism.  I have never heard a Sinai student say, ""I don't want to go to school today"" and we knew that our kids could learn a lot from this culture, these kids and this community.  It has always been our philosophy that we are not ""helping"" them but we are enriching each other - building bridges through a shared purpose and our priority remains Water First, then Power (in the form of electricity, playground, solar or simply education), then Peace follows (in the form of friendship, love and joy).My husband John meeting Arafa for the first time in 2008 at the Sinai Primary School in Babati, Tanzania.   At this point, these students had never encountered an English speaking person from America!In our first year of the sister school model curriculum, the students at Woodland Hill Montessori School working with the students from the Sinai school in Tanzania created a movie, art exhibit, photography exhibit and held a ten item auction.  The model was a success and the 2009 Earth Day exhibit raised enough money for us get water for the school, but also donate books, build a library, hire a kindergarten teacher, support English lessons for the teachers and more.  Please take the time to view the original movies created by these pioneers.  Links below and feel free to share them - several of the student movies have since won awards and one 14 year old American student won a prestigious National Geographic award for his photo of a Sinai school student taken in 2012 while he volunteered on a summer project trip.THE WATER PROJECT MOVIE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti5i0j0tRnQOn our third trip to Babati in 2009, we brought 5 middle school age students from Woodland Hill Montessori School in East Greenbush, New York and installed the first pump to bring water to the Sinai school. One of those students, Ali Reinhold, returned to Babati in 2012 - this time with 18 students from the Capital Region.  The 2012 projects included a drip irrigation system, a new library, an art and movie room, computer lab and lessons, reading and spelling programs.  A garden was planted to sustain the lunch program.  By the end of 2012, the Sinai school was unrecognizable and its progress was reflected in what mattered most, the students' grades and future educational opportunities and connected communities. This photo from 2009 shows Sherrie Clune, an upper elementary teacher we sponsored (one of four) to visit the Sinai school and gather information to bring back and inspire their students to undertake ""the Water Project.""   Working with the students (Arafa pictured) we renovated several classrooms, installed a hand washing station and conducted a geographical survey to find suitable water source.

We have sponsored teachers from Sinai school to visit the United States in 2009 and 2011.  During one of those visits, the Hawthorne Valley School offered a scholarship to a deserving Sinai school student. Ali Reinhold, a senior at Hawthorne Valley, spearheaded a campaign to bring Arafa to the United States and we helped make that happen. Arafa successfully completed 8th grade and is now a thriving ninth grader. 



Ali Reinhold, now a college freshman at Wells, travelled to Tanzania in 2009 with the first middle school volunteer trip.  A true ambassador for girls education, she has returned four more times, and spearheaded a campaign to help bring Arafa to study in America on a full scholarship at Hawthorne Valley Waldorf School.
In Ali's words:When I first visited the Sinai School at the age of thirteen, I immediately knew that my life was going to change. Little did I know how much. I have now traveled to Babati five times and, throughout these journeys, I have gained a little sister in Arafa, an extended family on the other side of the world, and a passion for empowerment through education. Arafa has truly inspired so many people, both in the US and in Tanzania. I am so thankful that she is part of my life, and to all of the people who have made made it possible thus far. I have grown to care so much for her and all of the students at the Sinai School, and I want opportunities (like those of the scholarships) to remain possible.
If you would like to see how this all transpired, please click the link below and spend a few minutes watching this video I compiled to document the process: https://youtu.be/_8W3x2zc8H4


Arafa pictured here at her 8th Grade Graduation with her first tutor, Kevin Wade, who spent over four months in Tanzania to prepare Arafa for her visa and to travel, and spent her first summer vacation to visit her family in Babati so Arafa didn't lose her progress on learning English.

In connection with Arafa's scholarship, we began a Sinai scholars program so that the top girl and boy of each class can attend private secondary eduction. Ten other children receive bicycles, allowing them to get to the secondary school which is over 10 kilometers away.  The kids know that beginning year 5, their grades are being counted for these awards and we push them to grab the brass ring - an education!

Arafa not only dreams of graduating High School here in the United States, she is aiming for University and Law School! It's her dream to empower girls from her village, her country, and here in the United States to dream big and start small, study hard, and get an education.  
Arafa graduated 8th grade and is currently getting all As and B+ during her 9th grade.  Pictured below - a very proud community celebrates her 8th grade graduation last June.





What Your Donated Funds Will Cover:
1st Priority:  School Fees
Hawthorne Valley School donated a five year scholarship to Arafa, allowing her to complete eighth grade and four years of High School.  Arafa's school fees for High School are $2,500 per year. (total $10,000).  
2nd Priority:  Summer School and Tutoring
Although Arafa's English improves everyday, she needs help to fill some gaps in her primarily education and improve her English.  She now understands and speaks fluently, but needs tutoring and summer programs to assist her English skills.  We'd also like to hire a computer and math tutor.  $2,000 per year. (total $8,000)
3rd Priority:  Arafa's Direct Expenses 
When Arafa came to upstate New York, she'd never owned a winter coat or a textbook.  Arafa loves sports and is a talented athlete, member of the soccer team and interested in swimming, dance and theater.  She also calls home to her family every Sunday. Her current host family generously provides room and board and more importantly their love and support.  $2,000 per year. (total $6,000)

4th Priority: Educating Girls, Inspiring Excellence
Sinai Scholars - We've been working with the Sinai school for over seven years and the selection of one student to study in the New York was balanced with the unmet needs of all children graduating.  There are approximately 100 Sinai students each year who graduate 7th grade and can't afford secondary school or lack access to quality secondary education.  Working with community leaders, we put in place selection criteria to choose one boy and one girl to attend a private school in Tanzania - cost $1,000 per year (including room and board).    At full strength, the program requites $9,000 per year.  (total for 2 years - $18,000)


5th Priority: Bicycles for Babati Secondary Scholars
Sinai Scholars - A program inspired by our daughter Grace, who saved her change for one year to help Arafa.  This was enough to fund 10 bicycles for the graduating 7th year primary students (12-13 years old).  The public secondary school is located over ten kilometers away, without water or electricity.  The bicycle program provides transportation, and inspiration for the the three years prior to graduation for the students to study and perform.  Many students, especially girls end their education at age 13 because it is difficult to get to school.  This helps. $800 per year (total $2,400).
6th Priority:  Arafa's Travel to be Home for Ramadan 
We don't let Arafa travel alone, but will volunteer our time and expenses, including our airfare to accompany her.  The average airfare to Tanzania is $1,750 in the summer and her village is several hours from the airport.  $2,000 per year (total $8,000).
Always A Priority - Sinai School Girls
There are multiple projects that need support and our goal is to make them sustainable.  The girls are in need of new latrines, washrooms and while the school now has water, solar panels would help reduce the cost of the pump.
Total: $50,400  (will cover programs until 2018)
Funds raised in excess of our goal are needed and we commit to spend them on continued support of Arafa and the Sinai Scholars and in particular, supporting the education of girls.  The Sinai school is in desperate need of new latrines / toilets for the girls as well as books.  We aim to install solar panels to decrease electricity costs next summer.  If at all possible, we'd like to make it possible for all Sinai students to gain access to secondary education.  We remain open to questions and accountable, and welcome volunteers for current and future projects.  Our Commitment to You: Every dollar donated will be put to the use stated here and for the education of Arafa and the children of Babati.  If you'd like to provide us your email, we will send regular updates and keep you informed of the students' and Arafa's progress to graduation from High School and beyond.

The Clay School of Ithaca is committed to providing a vibrant, creative space for community members to work with clay and learn alongside fellow artists from professional to emerging potters. Our goal is to foster a sense of community among students of all ages and enrich their continuing education through shared experiences around making art.Enlisting a cadre of well established potters in the area, who have decades of combined teaching experience, The Clay School of Ithaca is able to offer a variety of class descriptions, techniques, and approaches to working with clay. Students may choose to concentrate on wheel throwing, hand-building methods, surface decoration, and functional work. Monthly shelf rental is available to experienced students. And there are weekend and one-day workshops offered throughout the year for locals and out of town students as well.  Community Impact
After the closing of the Cornell Ceramics Studio in 2011, the Ithaca community lacks a place to bring students of all ages together to learn from a collective group of professional and emerging potters as teachers. The Clay School of Ithaca is being established to offer an open and collaborative environment for beginner and experienced ceramists, of all ages, to learn and creatively express themselves.After a long search for adequate and affordable square footage, Julia Dean, a former instructor at the Cornell Studio, is moving her own ceramic production studio, JULIA e. DEAN, Inc., from the basement of her home to a new space large enough to support her business and The Clay School of Ithaca’s teaching studio. 

    Meet The Staff   
Julia Dean:
My love affair with clay started at the age of 10 when I watched a potter work on the wheel.  It wasn’t until college, however, that I took my first pottery class. With a degree in Education from Murray State University, I combined a passion for creating and love of teaching by sharing this craft in studios in Texas, North Carolina and New York. I have continued my education over the years at Texas Christian University, Penland School of Crafts, and Chautauqua Institution.  
As a designer, I am committed to creating quality, stylish and affordable handmade pottery. As a loyal member of my local community, I am proud to be a Certified Living Wage Employer.

Classes will also be taught by the talented Tess Lawlor, Diane Sullivan, Julie Crosby (not pictured), Hannah Graeper, Gary Rith (not pictured), Tiana Trost (not pictured), Cary Joseph (not pictured) David Kingsbury, Tom Roach,  and studio manager Bri Richardson.
  Our Progress So Far

I’m now working with an architect to remodel and design the space into the ideal ceramic studio.

I am  humbled to be able to have created the combination. I love education and It is amazing how for maybe 10 years or more, my personal slogan has always been, ""Educator/Entrepreneur"". To be able to combine the two is always my goal and I believe that EWIAP soccer ball is a great part of this. About Murice Damion Miller!

El fútbol de asociación, más conocido como fútbol o fútbol, es el deporte más popular del mundo. Inglés es el idioma más útil en el mundo, sin competencia. También el español es el segundo idioma más estudiado en el mundo y el tercero entre los más populares en Internet. ¿Y si pudiera combinar los tres? Me siento muy honrado de poder han creado la combinación.

Me encanta la educación y es increíble cómo durante unos 10 años o más, mi lema personal siempre ha sido, ""Educador / Emprendedor"". Para ser capaz de combinar los dos es siempre mi objetivo y creo que el balón de fútbol EWIAP es una gran parte de esto.

Many of the signs and symptoms of PCOS can be detrimental to a young woman’s body image, particularly weight gain, excessive hair growth on the face and body, dirty looking patches on the skin called acanthosis nigricans (all of which are clinical markers of hyperinsulinemia), and acne. Such symptoms can negatively impact the emotional health of adolescents at a time when self-image is developing.

The most important step is diagnosing the condition, because getting treatment for PCOS reduces a girl's chances of developing serious problems.We can help many girls in leading a happy and normal life if it is diagnosed early,

WHY THIS PROJECT IS DIFFERENT:
Most NGO's rely solely on donations from the public and struggle continuously to raise their annual running costs. Our aim is to establish schools that last forever and are not reliant on donations to exist. Once we have raised enough money to set a school up - it will be fully sustainable and continue to teach the community forever. 
Quite simply, your support now will allow us to start this ambitious project, which we believe can provide a blue-print for sustainable schooling. For more information, please see www.almamatereducation.com  
OUR APPROACH:Alma Mater Education is a UK registered charity (1159983) and soon to be registered in Ireland also.Our unique 'Business-NGO' approach means that fifty percent of our students pay fees at below the normal rate, allowing the remaining fifty percent (from the most impoverished backgrounds) to study on full Alma Mater scholarships. The money generated from the fee-paying students will mean that running costs of the school are completely covered annually. We are also working with a local agricultural University to develop a farm that will feed the students and teach them and the local community how to grow and sell produce. We intend to use this pilot project, which will eventually have a student population of 480, as a model for expansion both in Ghana beyond.
IMPACT:

Education is a fundamental human right. However, we see everyday how unattainable this is for the World's poorest.
Estimated wage returns per additional year of schooling in Ghana increases from 4% per year for those with primary education, to 10% per year for those with secondary education. Furthermore, in a country that is fortunate to have excellent climates and extremely fertile lands, knowledge of farming is key to food security.

The three classrooms that we are campaigning for, will benefit between 105 and 120 students per year, over an expected period of forty years. Potentially this resource therefore could be used by over 5,000 students      
WHERE WE ARE NOW:
The total cost of the Wioso project in Kumasi, is £762,000. This will build a fully equipped secondary school for 480 students, with ICT facilities, library, science lab, sports fields and school offices. It will also construct and consistently manage a 25 acre farm that will provide food and further education to our students and the wider community.
We have already secured a little over £300,000 (over the course of three years),  and construction began in March 2015.  £60,000 will enable us to build three classrooms, fully kitted out with fans, lights, desks and all necessary teaching apparatus.
 The Kumasi Institute of Tropical Agriculture are planning the first crop rotations on our 25-acre farm and we will welcome our first 160 students in September 2015.

Neutral Fundamentals is a company
that teaches the fundamentals
of being an adult. Classes discuss topics such as money management, job searching, resume help,
how to make large purchases such as a car or an apartment and how to get involved in their communities. 


I
started this company because I feel there is a large gap between high school graduation and being an adult in the real world. As the youngest in my family, I was outgoing and adventurous,
but was also rather mischievous and troublesome at times. After some turbulent
adolescent years, I went on to graduate high school and joined the United States Navy where I spent 4 years stationed in San Diego, CA. After 7 years in California, I
returned home and finished my college degree while working full time. 
Throughout
my personal mistakes, choices, decisions, partying, studying, traveling and countless personal encounters with people from all walks of
life, I discovered this gap and I am determined to bridge it. I was raised with
a strong sense of personal responsibility and have faith that there are young
adults, just as determined as I was, to become independent and self-reliant. 
Getting this information to them has become my mission. 
Contributing to this business will help fund marketing costs and supplies costs for participants so that the can gain the knowledge they need to pursue success and independence.   What We Need & What You Get All contributed funds will go to:  Marketing supplies; Envelopes, stamps, brochure paper, labels, business mailbox, advertising fees (digital, local magazines and newspapers).  Supplies for classes: Full folder for each student with worksheets, resource sheets, helpful handouts, bottled water and snacks. If I do not reach my goal, all other funds raised will still go to marketing supplies and supplies for classes.    The Impact It is my belief that everyone feels their best when they are independent, self-reliant and well rounded members of society who do their best to provide for themselves. 
I feel strongly about personal responsibility and believe that unbiased and truthful education is the best way to promote accountability. I am in no way a ""certified expert"" in any one of these fields, but I do feel as though the things that I have learned in my life so far could really help someone. 

The sense of accomplishment that you get from taking care of yourself and being productive can be life changing; I do have experience in that.
That is what I am here to promote.   Risks & Challenges Great reward comes only from taking a great risk... there has to be some risk involved!
Yes, yes, it all sounds good in theory. But what is no one buys it?
There is a risk that every single person that I send a letter and brochure to will throw it away. However, based on the feedback that I have received and the current facilities willing to host classes, it is unlikely that this idea will go unnoticed. 
And if it does... I will not stop.
I will teach for free. I will teach to those who have nothing to give, but everything to gain. If there is a will to be better- I have the will to help. 
I am working hard to cultivate lasting relationships with future hosts and participants.  My ideal locations are high schools, community colleges, GED testing facilities, family and individual counselors, churches, YMCAs, and Park and Recreational Facilities around the St. Louis area. 
I will do everything in my power to continue my mission.
    Other Ways You Can Help Ok, so you feel SUPER strongly about this idea, but you just aren't in a place where you can contribute financially. No problem.
If you feel as though this is a beneficial program and you would like to help make it successful, please share this page on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr- anywhere!  There are brochures available online for you to print or share with friends, schools, families and colleagues. 
If you have any questions or want more information, please visit my website, call me, email me or send me a letter!
Thank you so much!!

<p>Colin is a digital media professional, portrait photographer and drummer. Julia is a mixed media visual artist and web designer, who has also been involved in coordinating open submission exhibitions for Scottish arts societies for many moons.</p>
<p>We work hard and play hard, with a very blurred seam in-between, spending much of our free time on cultural pursuits, or volunteering to help friends with their own creative businesses. One of our mottos is<i> ‘It’s nice to be nice’</i>. Truth is, we both get a kick out of knowing that we have helped another creative person progress.</p>
<p><b><i></i></b></p><h3><b>It's nice to be nice!</b></h3><p></p>
<p></p>With this in mind we have devised <b>Studio Faire</b>.<div><br/></div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469700641/faire-header_m5l2j5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Studio Faire will allow us the opportunity to combine our extensive experience to offer a supportive environment for the development of ideas and the production of new work through residencies for national and international contemporary artists, designers, performers, writers, musicians, makers and other creative professionals, in the beautiful surroundings of the Lot-et-Garonne (47), France.</p>
<p><b><i>Tout ce que vous voulez faire…faire en France au Studio Faire.<br/></i></b><i style=""background-color: initial;"">(Whatever you want to make…do it in France at Studio Faire.)</i></p>
<p>We have our aims and objectives written, over forty years combined experience in the creative industries and over 1,000 relevant contacts. We have also spent the past two years scouting out the best location in the South West of France that can offer the desired pace and space. <br/><br/></p>
<p></p>

<br/><p></p>
<h3>We are ready to make Studio Faire a reality!<br/>But we need your support.</h3>
<div>
<p>We are self-employed, with no existing property to sell or significant inheritance in the bank and, therefore, little chance of saving the amount required for a deposit on a property with living accommodation and workshop space suitable for the creative residencies.</p>
<p>So, we have developed a three-pronged plan: spend less and save, make more and save … ask for support and save!</p>
<p>By spending less and working harder to make more, we are able to raise half of the required deposit for the property but we need your support to reach the necessary target that will bring Studio Faire to life. <br/><br/></p>

<h3>What we need and what you get.</h3>
<p>Having spent some time now looking at properties, we have projected that we need a minimum of €210,000 (£176,220) to purchase a property, which provides the accommodation and workspace required for Studio Faire.</p>
<p>For a property at this price, the cash needed to close (incorporating the down payment, notaire, legal, bank &amp; broker fees) is €48,343 (£40,576)</p>
<p>Through this IndieGoGo campaign, we are aiming to raise: €23,767 <b>(£20,000)</b> </p>
<p>This is just under half of the deposit required. We will (more than) match-fund this amount to end up with the €48,343 (£40,576) that we need for the deposit.</p>
<p>Once purchased, Studio Faire (the business) will cover the monthly mortgage payments, all running costs &amp; maintenance of the property, with both of us managing the company and the property. We will also help residents with their own funding applications or crowdfunding campaigns, if desired.</p>
<p>€210,000 (£176,220) will allow us to purchase a property in the Lot-et-Garonne that has:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Self catering accommodation for a minimum of three residents (3 double bedrooms, plus shared living room/kitchen)</span><br/>

<p>You will be helping to nurture collaborative thinking, personal reflection, exploration of new processes and inspiration from the surroundings!</p>

<p><b>Who
We Are</b></p>
<p>New
Testament Christian Academy was founded in 1991 by Dr. William Hohman, Senior
Pastor of New Testament Church and Faye Marquardt. We are a private Christian
School that offers classes from Three Year Old Pre-kindergarten all the way
through twelfth grade. Our mission is<i>“Training leaders of
tomorrow with moral strength and Godly wisdom.” </i>We have a dedicated
staff that has made fulfilling this mission a priority. Our school motto is “<i>Good, better, best, I’ll never rest, until
my good is better, and my better is best.” </i>Our students and staff lovingly
refer to us as “The Academy” and look forward to our annual end of the year
“Academy Awards and Graduation Ceremony” where they receive honor and trophies
for all of their hard work. </p>
<p>We
hold to an attitude of excellence and require higher grade performance than
most other schools. We also have mandatory participation in every event, so
each student learns to help one another in their strengths and weaknesses. Our
graduates have gone on to excel at universities, colleges, and in the labor
force. Our alumni include lawyers, engineers, pastors, teachers, nurses, and
police officers, just to name a few. We are proud of who we are, the education
we offer, and what we do in our community, but realize that we cannot do it
alone.</p>
<p><b>We Need Your Help</b></p>
<p>NTCCA
has gone through many changes over the years. A new Gymnasium and modern
kitchen and cafeteria, as well as both boys and girls locker rooms were added
in 2000. Our gym was used for our own Physical Education classes, indoor
recess, and weekly chapel meetings. It was also used for our team sporting
events including regional tournaments. We have also made the gymnasium
available to the community. We have hosted food distributions (after a tornado came
through our town), expos, concerts, and it is still currently being used by a
local basketball team for practice.</p>
<p>At the
time of the addition we purchased a “state of the art” gym floor. Unfortunately
the floor had issues within a short time of installation. After months and
years of trying to solve the issues with the company that sold us the floor,
our hands were tied as they went out of business. So we made due with a gym
floor that has “dead spots” (the basketball will not bounce), tiles that have warped,
and a floor that is almost impossible to keep clean but cannot live with it as
it is any longer. Through much prayer and hard work, we have negotiated a great
price on a replacement floor and installation with a company.</p>
<p>We also
had two furnaces installed on the roof of our gym; when the addition was
complete, to heat such a large area in our cold Wisconsin winter months. Both
of these units were used but they were donated to us and we were very grateful.
Even though they were used they have worked very hard for the past fourteen
years, providing heat in the winter and cooling in the summer. Over those years
we have had to have much work done on both furnaces and eventually one of them
has outlived its usefulness, and the other not far behind. Our service man told
us “There is nothing else we can do to repair the unit” and they politely asked
us not to call again.</p>
<p>So, in
addition to replacing the gym floor we need to replace at least one of our roof
furnaces.</p>
<p>We are
completely funded by donations, fundraisers, along with a small amount of
tuition from our families. We have made it a point of keeping our tuition as
low as possible during this time of economic uncertainty, trying to keep as
many children enrolled as possible.</p>
<p><b>What We Have Already Accomplished</b></p>
<p>Through
fundraising and local donations we have been able to raise one-tenth of the
money needed for our Gymnasium renovation project. NTCCA students and staff
will continue to work hard to reach our financial goal but we are asking that
you partner with us.</p>
<p><b>How You Can Help</b></p>
<p><i>Your monetary donation-</i> After
the funds we already raised, we need an additional $63,000.00 to reach our
goal. All giving is tax deductable and greatly appreciated. We have special
“perks” for each level of giving, but they are only a small token of our
gratitude. There is no gift too small and no matter the size of the
contribution each one will be used well. </p>
<p><i>Your social network- </i>Help us
spread the word. “Follow” or “like” our Facebook page. Please share our
campaign as well.</p>
<p><i>Your prayers- </i>Lift us
up in your prayers.</p>

for all of their hard work. 
We
hold to an attitude of excellence and require higher grade performance than
most other schools. We also have mandatory participation in every event, so
each student learns to help one another in their strengths and weaknesses. Our
graduates have gone on to excel at universities, colleges, and in the labor
force. Our alumni include lawyers, engineers, pastors, teachers, nurses, and
police officers, just to name a few. We are proud of who we are, the education
we offer, and what we do in our community, but realize that we cannot do it
alone.
We Need Your Help
NTCCA
has gone through many changes over the years. A new Gymnasium and modern
kitchen and cafeteria, as well as both boys and girls locker rooms were added
in 2000. Our gym was used for our own Physical Education classes, indoor
recess, and weekly chapel meetings. It was also used for our team sporting
events including regional tournaments. We have also made the gymnasium
available to the community. We have hosted food distributions (after a tornado came
through our town), expos, concerts, and it is still currently being used by a
local basketball team for practice.
At the
time of the addition we purchased a “state of the art” gym floor. Unfortunately
the floor had issues within a short time of installation. After months and
years of trying to solve the issues with the company that sold us the floor,
our hands were tied as they went out of business. So we made due with a gym
floor that has “dead spots” (the basketball will not bounce), tiles that have warped,
and a floor that is almost impossible to keep clean but cannot live with it as
it is any longer. Through much prayer and hard work, we have negotiated a great
price on a replacement floor and installation with a company.
We also
had two furnaces installed on the roof of our gym; when the addition was
complete, to heat such a large area in our cold Wisconsin winter months. Both
of these units were used but they were donated to us and we were very grateful.
Even though they were used they have worked very hard for the past fourteen
years, providing heat in the winter and cooling in the summer. Over those years
we have had to have much work done on both furnaces and eventually one of them
has outlived its usefulness, and the other not far behind. Our service man told
us “There is nothing else we can do to repair the unit” and they politely asked
us not to call again.
So, in
addition to replacing the gym floor we need to replace at least one of our roof
furnaces.
We are
completely funded by donations, fundraisers, along with a small amount of
tuition from our families. We have made it a point of keeping our tuition as
low as possible during this time of economic uncertainty, trying to keep as
many children enrolled as possible.
What We Have Already Accomplished
Through
fundraising and local donations we have been able to raise one-tenth of the
money needed for our Gymnasium renovation project. NTCCA students and staff
will continue to work hard to reach our financial goal but we are asking that
you partner with us.
How You Can Help
Your monetary donation- After
the funds we already raised, we need an additional $63,000.00 to reach our
goal. All giving is tax deductable and greatly appreciated. We have special
“perks” for each level of giving, but they are only a small token of our
gratitude. There is no gift too small and no matter the size of the
contribution each one will be used well. 
Your social network- Help us
spread the word. “Follow” or “like” our Facebook page. Please share our
campaign as well.
Your prayers- Lift us
up in your prayers.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Der Art. 146 GG kann auch von den Vertretern solcher Politik zum endgültigen Abbau demokratischer Souveränität mißbraucht werden.
Dem wollen wir durch unsere Kampagne entgegentreten und die Kernfragen aufwerfen:
Welche Verfassungsregeln braucht es, dass demokratische Willensbildung und politische Entscheidungen dem Anspruch der Menschenwürde und dem Gemeinwohl dienen?
Welche Verfassungsregeln braucht es, um basisdemokratische sowie regionale Ansprüche, repräsentativen Parlamentarismus und demokratische Kontrolle optimal zu verbinden?
  Es geht um die Demokratie 
Der angestrebte Verfassungskonvent soll moderne demokratische Verfahren entwickeln, in denen sachpolitische Reformen im Dialog mit der Zivilgesellschaft beraten werden und durch die Bürger legitimiert werden.Demokratie ist mehr als ein Urnengang, bei dem die Bürger auf Jahre ihre Stimme abgeben. Moderne Demokratie ist die staatsrechtliche Selbstorganisation einer Gesellschaft freier Bürger.
  Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann
Sollten Sie unsere Kampagne nicht materiell stützen können, bitten wir Sie um die aktive Verbreitung unseres Anliegens. Helfen Sie uns, die für eine Demokratie lebensnotwendige bürgerliche Unruhe ins Volk zu tragen.
Mit Ihrer Unterstützung
tragen Sie bei, dass das Engagement zur Entfaltung der demokratischen Idee
nicht umsonst ist.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3> <p>We know how to build earthquake resistant buildings. We know how to retrofit existing buildings to minimize risk to life. Unfortunately, however, <b>earthquake engineering is a first-world phenomenon</b>. One does not have to look far to see that damages in the western world are measured in dollars, whereas in developing nations they are measured in lives (official estimates are of over 300,000 deaths due to the 2010 Haiti earthquake alone). </p>
<p>Political corruption and sub-standard building codes have prevented the 
third-world from benefiting from significant advancements in earthquake 
science and have created a scenario where hundreds of millions of people
 are at undue risk to earthquake induced damage and loss of life. The problem is exacerbated daily by skyrocketing urban densification in developing countries. What 
is the solution? How can we help?<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1351035/files/20150402211824-urban_risk.jpg?1428034704"" src="""" style=""width: 445.969px; height: 331px;""/></p>
<br/>
<p>My name is Robin Bruce. I am an earthquake engineer based out of 
Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. I have an undergraduate degree in 
Geological Engineering (University of British Columbia, Canada) and a master's 
degree in Engineering Seismology (Joseph Fourier University, France &amp; University 
of Pavia, Italy). I have traveled to nearly 40 countries in my life, in particular spending significant amounts of time in earthquake prone areas of the world including the Pacific Northwest, Central and South America, the Mediterranean and the Balkan states. <br/></p>
<p>The first step in earthquake preparedness is risk assessment - identifying which infrastructure is most vulnerable. <b>My goal is to develop an international consultancy providing 
low-cost/sliding-scale earthquake hazard assessments to impoverished 
nations</b>. These hazard assessments will allow local engineers to 
prioritize limited public funds to maximize cost benefits. <br/></p>
<p>Hands down, the main cause of death due to earthquakes is from building collapse. Schools, hospitals and critical infrastructure are thus the obvious choices for seismic retrofit prioritization, but which of these are at the greatest risk in a given community? When it comes to earthquakes, all ground was NOT created equal. Just as important as how well the buildings were constructed is what kind of ground they are sitting on. Even in the case of identical buildings built adjacent to each other, the position of the building and the characteristics of the underlying subsoil could mean the difference between catastrophic and fatal collapse or safe egress (see photo).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p><sup><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1350936/files/20150402202025-Quake_7.jpg?1428031225"" src="""" style=""width: 612.264px; height: 406px;""/></sup></p>
<br/>
<p>Traditionally, hazard assessments required expensive drilling operations to evaluate subsurface soils, followed by laboratory testing of soil properties and time consuming computer modelling. Cutting edge technology, however, allows us to quickly and accurately record and interpret background vibrations in the earth called microtremors. These microtremors hold key information about how infrastructure (buildings, roadways, dams, power plants) will react to seismic events. Once we know which areas are at the greatest risk, we are then able to prioritize earthquake retrofits. <b>With only limited funds available for seismic improvements, a quick and easy low-cost solution is desperately needed to provide help where help is needed the most.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>

</div><br/></div>","Earthquake Casualties are NOT a Forgone Conclusion!
 We know how to build earthquake resistant buildings. We know how to retrofit existing buildings to minimize risk to life. Unfortunately, however, earthquake engineering is a first-world phenomenon. One does not have to look far to see that damages in the western world are measured in dollars, whereas in developing nations they are measured in lives (official estimates are of over 300,000 deaths due to the 2010 Haiti earthquake alone). 
Political corruption and sub-standard building codes have prevented the 
third-world from benefiting from significant advancements in earthquake 
science and have created a scenario where hundreds of millions of people
 are at undue risk to earthquake induced damage and loss of life. The problem is exacerbated daily by skyrocketing urban densification in developing countries. What 
is the solution? How can we help?




My name is Robin Bruce. I am an earthquake engineer based out of 
Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. I have an undergraduate degree in 
Geological Engineering (University of British Columbia, Canada) and a master's 
degree in Engineering Seismology (Joseph Fourier University, France & University 
of Pavia, Italy). I have traveled to nearly 40 countries in my life, in particular spending significant amounts of time in earthquake prone areas of the world including the Pacific Northwest, Central and South America, the Mediterranean and the Balkan states. 
The first step in earthquake preparedness is risk assessment - identifying which infrastructure is most vulnerable. My goal is to develop an international consultancy providing 
low-cost/sliding-scale earthquake hazard assessments to impoverished 
nations. These hazard assessments will allow local engineers to 
prioritize limited public funds to maximize cost benefits. 
Hands down, the main cause of death due to earthquakes is from building collapse. Schools, hospitals and critical infrastructure are thus the obvious choices for seismic retrofit prioritization, but which of these are at the greatest risk in a given community? When it comes to earthquakes, all ground was NOT created equal. Just as important as how well the buildings were constructed is what kind of ground they are sitting on. Even in the case of identical buildings built adjacent to each other, the position of the building and the characteristics of the underlying subsoil could mean the difference between catastrophic and fatal collapse or safe egress (see photo).




Traditionally, hazard assessments required expensive drilling operations to evaluate subsurface soils, followed by laboratory testing of soil properties and time consuming computer modelling. Cutting edge technology, however, allows us to quickly and accurately record and interpret background vibrations in the earth called microtremors. These microtremors hold key information about how infrastructure (buildings, roadways, dams, power plants) will react to seismic events. Once we know which areas are at the greatest risk, we are then able to prioritize earthquake retrofits. With only limited funds available for seismic improvements, a quick and easy low-cost solution is desperately needed to provide help where help is needed the most.

  What We Need
 The current state-of-the-art technology for fast, reliable and inexpensive earthquake hazard assessments is called the Tromino (www.tromino.eu). The Tromino is an ultra-portable seismometer which records microtremor vibrations from inside buildings and on the ground surface. It can be operated by a single person. Each reading takes just a few minutes, allowing for rapid assessments of relatively large areas. 



The Tromino sells out of Italy for 10,800 EUR. This equates to $15,000 CAD + taxes, shipping/insurance and applicable duties. Factoring in crowdfunding and credit card fees results in a required total of $19,500 CAD. I am happy to provide a detailed accounting of how I arrived at this figure. Please email me at earthquakephilanthropy@gmail.com.
I am solely looking to crowdfund the purchase cost of the Tromino. All other startup costs I will incur myself. If I do not reach my crowdfunding goal I will fund the project through further depleting my savings and incurring personal debt. I have quit my job as a geotechnical earthquake engineer and am focusing full-time on developing this consultancy. I plan to operate locally and regionally while actively pursuing international humanitarian assignments. 
    The Impact Earthquake vulnerability is well understood. Our only limitation is access to educated practitioners and proper technology. I can provide the manpower, if you help me provide the technology.
Seismic hazard is generally well known worldwide on a macro level, however that information holds little meaning without incorporating the details of site specific building and ground conditions. 


Cheap, accurate and readily available risk assessments will allow local governments to put their money toward essential improvements to the most critical infrastructure and thus the people in the most need. Ultimately, my goal is to provide communities in developing nations with the information they require to best prepare themselves for a crippling natural disaster.

ENGLISH VERSION
The International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is the world math contest for high school students and it’s held annually
in a different country. It is the oldest science competition and the most
prestigious one in the planet and little by little, the competition has been
expanding, to the point of exceeding 100 participating countries; every year

Sadly, Nicaragua has participated only

in Colombia*. This is because of the lack of resources to fund the airplane
tickets, and even worse when the contest is conducted in distant countries.
The 56th edition of the IMO will take place in Thailand, exactly in the city of Chiang Mai. Each participating
country must assume the expenses of the transportation of its team from their
home country, to the headquarters of the event, while the Organization
Committee guarantees the lodging and feeding of the whole delegation.
From 2015 on, the Olympic and ex-Olympic
teams of the Academia de Jóvenes Talento de Nicaragua aim to goal a continuous, solid and successful
participation from Nicaragua in this event. However, we don’t count with the
necessary resources to pay the fees of the airplane tickets from Nicaragua to
Chiang Mai; though we do possess the required motivation, will and dedication
to represent Nicaragua in the most excellent way.
That’s why we need your help to defray the
fee for each airplane ticket, around $2,500 (American dollars), i.e. we need around
$15,000 to send the team.
Since last year, the students have been
part of a wide selective process to be taken in the team, plus a permanent
training to excel their problem-solving skills for the high-level of this
competition. 
In the last few years, Nicaragua has been
accredited with more than 50 prizes in the Iberoamerican and Central American
and the Caribbean Olympiads, confirming a constant improvement.
We are certain that our participation in
such Olympiad will mark a significant precedent to the Nicaraguan education,
because it will encourage the students with difficulty in math to change and it
will push other talented students that haven’t discovered their abilities in
this science, promoting and contributing to the scientific and technical growth
of Nicaragua.
