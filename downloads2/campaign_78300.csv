<p><b>Setting the Scene</b>:</p>
<p>I’ve just sung Gershwin’s <i>Love is Here To Stay</i> in a fairy tale setting in Silver Lake, up in the hills of Los Angeles. Spanish house, tiled courtyard with twinkly lights, handsome couple, lovely guests, a magical evening in early October. I’m sitting on a couch, when another guest joins me, and seemingly out of the blue, he asks, “Do you have a Christmas album?” Me: “uh, no?” (buh?) He went on to say, “You should! I’d buy it!” Hmm. Tucked that thought away for later, sang some more and enjoyed the rest of the evening.</p>

<p><b>Thinking about it:</b></p>
<p>Fast forward to about 36 hours later, our flight home. In-flight movie, <i>Begin Again</i>, starring Mark Ruffalo as down-on-his luck record producer and Keira Knightly as fledgling singer/songwriter who just needs a break. They meet, and as luck or serendipity would have it, record an album on the run, guerilla-style, in locations all over NYC. I’m watching this movie/scenario unfold and then pause to look at the sky, “Okay, universe, I get it! Gotta think about this Christmas album thing.”</p>
<p><b>Realizing the dream:</b></p>
<p>Back home in Cleveland I start thinking about the idea, wondering if I’m crazy, but – I used to work at a record company, so I know how that part of the business works. I *am* a trained musician and pretty decent, if I say so myself. I am blessed with lots of friends who also happen to be musicians, and with whom I’d dearly love to collaborate on a project like this, not to mention <b>I really like the idea of creating paying gigs for fellow musicians and other artists who’d be involved in the project.</b></p>
<p><b>Why Christmas music, why now?</b></p>
<p>Having gotten to the notion that I really liked the idea of making an album, thought harder about the idea of it being specifically of Christmas music, and came up with a resounding ""Yes!""  Why? Well! Let me tell you:  I love Christmas - I love the decorations, the music, the parties, and yes, the sentiment of wishing for peace on the earth, good will to men. (For men, women, Whovians, all of us, yes, I like that idea! Oops, let my nerdy side show, there.)</p>

<p><b>The Music:</b></p>
<p>So - imagine you've supported this project and then one day a cd magically arrives in the mail and you open it, and - what do you find?</p>
<p>Not one, but TWO kinds of Christmas music!  I am enamored of both jazz-flavored Christmas standards and Celtic-flavored, sparser styles, and thought, ""Let's do both!"" but not all mushed together, as that'd be a little weird. We're doing a Side A/Side B thing; one half more jazzy, the other a little more Irish.</p>
<p>Here's one on the jazzy side: 'Zat You, Santa Claus?</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Where You Come In:</b><br/></p>
<p>Most amazing and wondrous to me: every time I’ve said these words out loud , <b>“Hey, I’m thinking about making a Christmas album,”</b> the person I’m talking to says, <b>“Great/that’s cool/that’s awesome AND, I’d buy that!”</b> Which is fantastic, cuz it’d make me super sad to put this cool thing together only to have it languish on one of my dusty bookshelves….</p>
<p>That’s where you, lovely people, come in! I’ve mentioned collaboration – absolutely necessary to make music and a joyful thing, and necessary to make this dream come true! I can’t make the music alone, and I can’t make the project happen alone either. I’m asking you to take a chance on this dream with me by supporting the project here on Kickstarter. Take a chance on our dream, and I’ll make sure you get something wonderful and sparkly marvelous back! </p>
<p><b>So, how about it? You in?</b></p>

<p>•<b>	Mister Joe Barone, pianist and my official Overseer-of-Things</b>. Joe keeps an eye on things and makes sure it all runs smoothly, with the occasional wise-crack or five.</p>

<p>• <b>Marshall Griffith, piano</b> - one of my theory teachers whilst at CIM, now a colleague and friend: <a href=""http://www.marshallgriffith.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marshall</a>!  </p>
<p>• <b>Justin Hart, drummer</b> - worked with Justin on <i>The Light in the Piazza </i> at Lakeland, very happy to have him on board!</p>

<p>•	The recording studio! I want to make this album sound the best it can, the best WE can, hence working with <a href=""http://www.audiorecordingstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Audio Recording Studio</a> (they work with the Cleveland Orchestra and smaller groups, how lucky am I?) This starts with two days in July, then more in August.</p>
<p>•	The musicians! See above </p>
<p>•	Making the CDs! </p>
<p>•	Making the little sleeve/box things the CDs come in! And cover art, let’s not forget that!</p>
<p>•	Mechanical licensing and rights to songs </p>
<p>•	Photography - also creates work for local people, yay!<a href=""http://bethsegalphotography.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Beth Segal</a> does gorgeous work!</p>
<p>•	Christmas ornaments for the Super Deluxe version of the album</p>
<p><b>Over and beyond the goal:</b></p>
<p>Monies above and beyond our goal would help us improve some of the things listed above, such as more money for cover art, photography, etc, and allow us to do things like have a CD release party and do more to promote the album once it’s done. Every little bit helps!</p>

(For men, women, Whovians, all of us, yes, I like that idea! Oops, let my nerdy side show, there.)

Christmas Party!

Yours truly: enjoying myself to pieces, laughing at a Christmas party!
The Music:
So - imagine you've supported this project and then one day a cd magically arrives in the mail and you open it, and - what do you find?
Not one, but TWO kinds of Christmas music!  I am enamored of both jazz-flavored Christmas standards and Celtic-flavored, sparser styles, and thought, ""Let's do both!"" but not all mushed together, as that'd be a little weird. We're doing a Side A/Side B thing; one half more jazzy, the other a little more Irish.
Here's one on the jazzy side: 'Zat You, Santa Claus?
Where You Come In:
Most amazing and wondrous to me: every time I’ve said these words out loud , “Hey, I’m thinking about making a Christmas album,” the person I’m talking to says, “Great/that’s cool/that’s awesome AND, I’d buy that!” Which is fantastic, cuz it’d make me super sad to put this cool thing together only to have it languish on one of my dusty bookshelves….
That’s where you, lovely people, come in! I’ve mentioned collaboration – absolutely necessary to make music and a joyful thing, and necessary to make this dream come true! I can’t make the music alone, and I can’t make the project happen alone either. I’m asking you to take a chance on this dream with me by supporting the project here on Kickstarter. Take a chance on our dream, and I’ll make sure you get something wonderful and sparkly marvelous back! 
So, how about it? You in?


 The Details:
Cool people involved include the following:
•	Jordan Cooper on piano, also music director for this shindig. Jordan’s amazing – he was pianist and music director for The Light in the Piazza at Lakeland Civic Theatre in 2014. Piazza is one of my favorite shows I’ve ever done, largely due to the cast, director, and people like Jordan!
•	Linda White, flute – an amazing player and really cool person, check her out here: Linda White.
•	Bob Gruca, guitar – also an amazing player (really, all of these people are) and he cracks me up. Bonus! Robert Gruca.
•	Ariel Clayton Karas, violin - more awesome sauce. Check out Ariel here: Ariel!
•	Mister Joe Barone, pianist and my official Overseer-of-Things. Joe keeps an eye on things and makes sure it all runs smoothly, with the occasional wise-crack or five.
•	Lindsay Krause Wissman, video – Linds made the fantastic video you’ve been viewing. She also makes cool knit stuff, what! Check her out at Etsy: Running with Sharpies.
• Marshall Griffith, piano - one of my theory teachers whilst at CIM, now a colleague and friend: Marshall!  
• Justin Hart, drummer - worked with Justin on The Light in the Piazza  at Lakeland, very happy to have him on board!
• Tim Keo, upright bassist extraordinaire  - woot! 
• Brian Mueller, ukelele (also plays bass guitar, mandolin and many other things)
Budget, or, Where’s This Money Going?
•	The recording studio! I want to make this album sound the best it can, the best WE can, hence working with Audio Recording Studio (they work with the Cleveland Orchestra and smaller groups, how lucky am I?) This starts with two days in July, then more in August.
•	The musicians! See above 
•	Making the CDs! 
•	Making the little sleeve/box things the CDs come in! And cover art, let’s not forget that!
•	Mechanical licensing and rights to songs 
•	Photography - also creates work for local people, yay! Beth Segal does gorgeous work!
•	Christmas ornaments for the Super Deluxe version of the album
Over and beyond the goal:
Monies above and beyond our goal would help us improve some of the things listed above, such as more money for cover art, photography, etc, and allow us to do things like have a CD release party and do more to promote the album once it’s done. Every little bit helps!",4.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>El
10 de setiembre de este año  en el Teatro Eugene O'Neill en San José,
Costa Rica, tendremos el Estreno Mundial de la ópera La Ruta de su Evasión,
basada en la novela de Yolanda Oreamuno, en el centenario de su nacimiento. La
temporada constará de seis funciones, y está planificada una gira a nivel
nacional y también internacional en un futuro cercano.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Al
inicio de este proyecto, en el año 2014, el Estado costarricense estuvo de
acuerdo en cubrir los costos de la producción de esta ópera, considerada por
todas las personas que la evaluaron como de gran relevancia y valor. Sin
embargo, al año siguiente, hubo recortes y redistribuciones de presupuesto al
interior del Ministerio de Cultura. Resultado de ello es que, en estos
momentos, con más de un año invertido en intenso trabajo, la producción no está
financiada. Pero la firme decisión de superar todos los  retos que se nos
pudieran presentar para hacer realidad esta idea estaba tomada desde el
principio.</p>
<p>Este
año, también el Teatro Abya Yala tiene aniversario, cumple 25 años de
existencia durante los cuales ha creado obras originales de alta calidad. Somos
un grupo con decenas de premios y reconocimientos por  diversos trabajos,
y sus miembros hemos participado en encuentros, talleres, simposios, festivales
 e impartido clases en muchos países del mundo. Una de nuestras líneas ha
sido la creación y producción de óperas, las cuales han surgido de diversas
fuentes de inspiración: la calle, el periódico, una obra de Vargas
Llosa. Sin embargo, nunca se ha hecho en nuestro país una ópera a partir
de una novela costarricense, y nos parece un gran acierto que esta primera vez
se realice una basada en el trabajo de su mejor novelista, Yolanda
Oreamuno.</p>
<p>Como
agrupación estamos más que preparados para enfrentarnos al reto, sobre todo
porque ya tenemos avanzado el 80% de la producción: diseños escenográficos, de
iluminación, de vestuario, diseño gráfico, el libreto, la música (2 horas y 30
minutos), el casting, los derechos de autor del heredero de la obra de Y.
Oreamuno y el teatro en donde será estrenada. Y ya se han adelantado aplausos
de personas entendidas en arte.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Su
compositor, Carlos José Castro Mora, tiene 30 años de carrera con obras para
orquesta sinfónica, cuartetos de cuerda, grupos de cámara, música para video,
cine, danza, teatro y, por supuesto, ópera; ha sido galardonado múltiples veces
en el país, y su música ha sido interpretada desde Singapur hasta Brasil y
desde Europa hasta Cuba. Es, además, el único compositor costarricense que ha
recibido un Grammy Latino en Composición, y su trabajo refleja sus influencias:
ritmos latinos, minimalismo y música contemporánea, con las cuales produce un
lenguaje muy personal que ya ha visto la luz en múltiples obras. Esta será su
ópera más compleja, dada la densidad de la novela misma y la madurez de su
carrera.</p>
<p>Roxana
Ávila, la directora escénica, tiene 30 años de carrera como directora teatral y
docente universitaria. Graduada con honores gracias a una beca Fulbright Hayes,
de la Universidad Carnegie Mellon, en dirección escénica, es co-fundadora del
Teatro Abya Yala. Ha dirigido y creado múltiples obras con las cuales ha ido
destilando una manera de hacer teatro muy específica. Su obra Vacío ha viajado
a diferentes lugares representando al país, y ganó el premio de la crítica
Cubana al mejor espectáculo extranjero en el año 2014. Ha impartido clases en
muchos países del continente americano: Estados Unidos, Cuba, Belice,
Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Panamá y Brasil.</p>
<p>Con
esta ópera, La ruta de su evasión, se marca el inicio del sueño que tenemos
desde 1994, de tomar novelas nacionales y convertirlas en óperas. Es hermoso
ver montajes de las óperas de Verdi, Puccini y Mozart, y lo seguiremos
haciendo. Sin embargo, es tiempo de hablar de eso que vemos como nuestro, de
cantar la historia de nuestra literatura, de ver nuestros reflejos en los
escenarios, nuestro universo simbólico. El país está maduro y este es el
momento, ya que tenemos alta calidad de intérpretes vocales y actorales, de
músicos y diseñadores, capacidad de composición y dirección y, sobre todo, un
público preparado para enfrentar una obra que se hace cargo de nuestros ritmos,
músicas e instrumentos para convertirlos en ópera. Le hablaremos a las
personas amantes de la ópera y compartiremos con ellas esta nueva versión de
este gran género y, a la vez, le hablaremos a la gente que no sabe de ópera
pero ama y disfruta la música y el drama. Saldremos en busca de un público
nuevo sin dejar atrás a nadie.</p>
<p><i>We will have a World
Premiere of the opera, The path of avoidance, based on the novel by Yolanda
Oreamuno, Costa Rica's foremost writer, on her 100th anniversary, in September
of this year.</i></p>
<p><i>At the beginning of
this process, in the year 2014, Costa Rica's government agreed to cover all the
costs of this production, considered by all the people who learned of  it as an opera of great value and relevance.
Nevertheless, the next year, there were significant budget cuts as well as
redistribution of monies inside the Ministry of Culture. As a result of that,
at this moment, with more than a year invested in intense work, the production
does not have financing. But the firm decision to overcome all challenges was
taken from the day we started such a visionary project.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>This year 2016,  is also the 25th anniversary of Abya Yala theater
company, during which we have created original plays of great quality. We are a
group of artists with dozens of awards and the members have participated in
countless workshops, seminars, conferences around the world. One of our lines
of work has been the creation and production of original operas emerging from
different inspirations and interests: San José's streets, newspapers, a novel
by Vargas Llosa. Nevertheless no one has created opera adapting Costarican
novels, and we think it is a luminous idea to depart from Costa Rica's best
novelist, Yolanda Oreamuno.</i></p>
<p><i>The composer, Carlos
José Castro Mora, has 30 years of work as a composer with pieces for symphonic
orquestra, string quartets, camera ensambles, music for video, movies, dance,
theater and, of course, operas; he has been distinguished multiple times in
Costa Rica for his work and his music has been performed in dozens of countries
from Singapour to Brazil and from Europe to Cuba. He is Costa Rica's only
composer to have received a Latin Grammy in composition, and his work reflects
his influences: latin rhythms, minimalism and contemporary music, under which
he has produced a personal voice that has seen the light in multiple pieces.
This will be his most complex opera, due to the density of the novel itself and
the maturity of his career.</i></p>
<p><i>Roxana Avila, the
scenic director, has 30 years as a professional 
director and is tenured professor at the University of Costa Rica.
Graduated with honors, under a Fulbright-Hayes Scholarship, from
Carnegie-Mellon University, in theater directing, she is the co-founder of
Teatro Abya Yala. She has directed and created a large number of productions
creating a distinct way of making theater. Her play VACIO (emptiness) has
travelled to different countries representing Costa Rica and won the award
given by the critics to best foreign performance in Cuba in 2014. She has
taught in many countries of the American Contient: Brazil, Panama, Honduras, El
Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Belice, Cuba and the United States. </i></p>
<p><i>This opera, La Ruta de
su Evasión, is the beginning of a dream we have since 1994, of taking national
novels and converting them into operas. It is beautiful to see operas by Verdi,
Puccini and Mozart, and we will continue doing so. Nevertheless it is time to
talk about what we call ours, to sing the story of our literature, to see our
reflections on the stage, our symbolic universe. The country is mature and this
is the moment, we have the high level of mastery from the singers, actors,
musicians, designers, the ability of composing, directing and, above all, an
audience prepared to face a play that takes our rhythms, musics and instruments
and transforms them into opera. We will speak to opera lovers and share with
them this new version of this great genre and, at the same time, we will speak
to people who don't know about opera but loves music and drama. We will go out
looking for a new audience without leaving anyone behind.</i></p>

<p><b>¿Por
qué es importante su ayuda?/</b></p>
<p><b><i>Why is your help important?</i></b><b></b></p>
<p>Vemos
el proceso descrito como parte de un momento histórico, tomando en cuenta, por
una parte, la merecida celebración del centenario del nacimiento de Yolanda
Oreamuno y, por otra, la confluencia de talentos que nos anima al lanzamiento
de esta campaña. Nunca antes se había solicitado dinero a la gente para hacer
ópera en Costa Rica, un país en donde este género es producido por el Estado, por
ser tan costoso. Pero llegó el momento de contar con la generosidad del
público. Nos encontramos trabajando: aprendiendo las canciones, ensayando,
presupuestando los diseños, hablando con los constructores y vestuaristas,
porque tenemos la fe ciega de que ustedes nos van a ayudar.  Con el mínimo
de apoyo, 50,000 dólares (y el ingreso proyectado de la taquilla) pagaremos los
materiales y a una parte de los artistas (músicos y cantantes). Pero si
lográramos la totalidad del costo real de la ópera, 120,000 dólares, pagaremos
la totalidad de los salarios (es decir de todos los que no son músicos y
cantantes) y costos ya invertidos. Si logramos  130,000 dólares haríamos
la grabación en digital en el estudio y con 140,000 haríamos el DVD.</p>
<p>Nuestro
sueño es girar la pieza por todo el país y luego por Centroamérica y México,
para luego ampliar a otras fronteras; sin embargo, nuestro primer paso es
estrenarla en San José el 10 de setiembre. </p>
<p>¡Es
por ello que contamos con usted!</p>
<p><i>We see the above
mentioned process as a historic moment, taking into consideration, on one side,
the long due celebration of Yolanda Oreamunos's one hundredth anniversary, and,
on the other, the yuxtaposition of so many talents that cheers us on to this
campaign. Never has anyone in Costa Rica asked for money to produce opera
because this genre, being so costly, is produced by the State.. But it is time
to count on the everyday person's generosity. We are rehearsing, learning the
songs, the music, speaking to constructors, budgeting the designs, the tailors
and seamstresses, because we have a blind faith that you will help us. With the
minimum asked here of $50,000 dollars plus the projected income from box office
we can pay the materials and a part of the artists (musicians and singers). But
if we are able to raise the real cost ($120,000 dollars) we could pay everyone
else. If we are able to raise $130,000 dollars we will produce a digital
recording and if we raise $140,000 dollars we will produce a DVD.</i></p>
<p><i>Our dream is to tour
through Central America and Mexico first and later to go beyond; nevertheless,
our first step is to produce it in San José, opening on September 10th.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>This is why we count
on your generosity!</i></p>
<p><b>¿Qué
podemos ofrecerle a cambio de su apoyo?/ <i>What
can we offer you for your donation?</i></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Será
un placer ofrecerle algo por su donación, pues nos interesa que usted sienta
satisfacción al apoyar este proyecto y que, a la vez, reciba un detalle de
gratitud por su generosidad. La artista gráfica Lisa Sánchez ha diseñado un
sello para la ópera (el ojo que se ve al inicio de esta página), y lo hemos
colocado en diversos objetos: calcomanías, pines, bolsos y
camisetas. Además, tenemos cenas VIP en el restaurante Sofía Mediterráneo,
en Barrio Escalante, o presentaciones con los cantantes en vivo y la presencia
de su marca en Vallas, Mupis y publicidad externa.</p>
<p>Pero
lo más importante será el agradecimiento de corazón por parte nuestra, la
magnanimidad de su parte en apoyar este proyecto, y su satisfacción al verlo en
escena.</p>
<p>Si
no lográramos reunir los 50,000 dólares, haríamos la obra en el 2017, pero al
ser este el año del centenario de Yolanda, nos parece imprescindible hacerlo
este setiembre.</p>
<p><i>It will be a pleasure
to offer you something for your donation, because we want you to feel
satisfaction by helping this project and at the same time receive a small token
of our gratitude. The graphic artist, Lisa Sánchez, has designed a logo for our
opera (the eye you see at the beginning of this campaign), and we have placed
it on different objects: stickers, pins, t-shirts, handbags. We also have VIP
dinners in Sofia Mediterráneo Restaurant, at Barrio Escalante, and live
presentations with the singers as well as the logo of your business or
institution on a massive scale throughout San José.</i></p>
<p><i>The most important
thing will be a heartfelt thank you on our part to your magnanimity by
supporting this project, and the satisfaction of seeing it, finally, on the
stage.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>If we are unable to
raise the $50,000 thousand dollars, we will perform it next year, but this
being Yolanda's centennial, it seems like a sheer necessity to open in
September.</i></p>

<p>Esta
es la primera ópera hecha a partir de una novela costarricense.</p>
<p>Es
el homenaje mayor que se le haya hecho a Yolanda Oreamuno.</p>
<p>Es
un aporte histórico el cambiar en la ópera los ritmos europeos por los latinos.</p>
<p>Es
una revelación: una ópera apta tanto para el público general como para el
especializado.</p>
<p>Es
un acontecimiento: una ópera financiada por la gente y no por el Estado.</p>
<p>Es
la primera vez que se mantendrá en repertorio una ópera de una compañía teatral
independiente.</p>
<p>Sin
su ayuda no será posible, pero con su aporte vamos a darle un giro a la
historia de la ópera y del teatro costarricense.</p>
<p>Abya
Yala no ha fallado en 25 años. Hemos creado proyectos enormes, algunos en
colaboración con artistas de tres países a la vez, hemos producido espectáculos
masivos y pequeñas joyas íntimas, y hemos mantenido viva y activa la compañía
por un cuarto de siglo, sin apoyo del Estado. Tenemos la habilidad, el talento
y la tenacidad.</p>
<p><i>This is the first
opera created adapted from a costarican novel.</i></p>
<p><i>This is the largest
homage to be made to Yolanda Oreamuno.</i></p>
<p><i>This is an historical
event changing the opera to have Latin rhythms instead of European.</i></p>
<p><i>It is a revelation: an
opera for both the specialized opera goers and the general public.</i></p>
<p><i>It is a groundbreaking
event: an opera financed by the people and not by the State.</i></p>
<p><i>It is the first time
an independent theater company maintains an opera in its repertoire</i></p>
<p><i>Without your support
it will not happen, but with your donation we will turn the wheel of Costa
Rica's theater and opera history.</i></p>
<p><i>Abya Yala has not
failed in 25 years. We have created enormous projects, in collaboration with
artists of three countries, we have produced massive spectacles and tiny
intimate jewels, and we have maintained alive and active the company for one
quarter of a century, without the support of the State. We have the ability,
the talent and the tenacity</i></p>

<p>Si
usted ama la obra de Yolanda Oreamuno, la música de Carlos Castro, el trabajo

importa! Ayúdenos a difundir esta campaña. Hágale bulla entre sus personas
conocidas. Dígale a las gentes que pueden donar, aunque sea un poquito, que lo
hagan. Cada contribución suma y posibilita. Si hubiera grandes colaboradores
sería genial, pero todo, absolutamente todo cuenta. Y por encima de ello cuenta
que usted se haya tomado el tiempo de leer esto, de creer en nosotros y de

songs, the music, speaking to constructors, budgeting the designs, the tailors
and seamstresses, because we have a blind faith that you will help us. With the
minimum asked here of $50,000 dollars plus the projected income from box office
we can pay the materials and a part of the artists (musicians and singers). But
if we are able to raise the real cost ($120,000 dollars) we could pay everyone
else. If we are able to raise $130,000 dollars we will produce a digital
recording and if we raise $140,000 dollars we will produce a DVD.
Our dream is to tour
through Central America and Mexico first and later to go beyond; nevertheless,
our first step is to produce it in San José, opening on September 10th.

This is why we count
on your generosity!
¿Qué
podemos ofrecerle a cambio de su apoyo?/ What
can we offer you for your donation?

Será
un placer ofrecerle algo por su donación, pues nos interesa que usted sienta
satisfacción al apoyar este proyecto y que, a la vez, reciba un detalle de
gratitud por su generosidad. La artista gráfica Lisa Sánchez ha diseñado un
sello para la ópera (el ojo que se ve al inicio de esta página), y lo hemos
colocado en diversos objetos: calcomanías, pines, bolsos y
camisetas. Además, tenemos cenas VIP en el restaurante Sofía Mediterráneo,
en Barrio Escalante, o presentaciones con los cantantes en vivo y la presencia
de su marca en Vallas, Mupis y publicidad externa.
Pero
lo más importante será el agradecimiento de corazón por parte nuestra, la
magnanimidad de su parte en apoyar este proyecto, y su satisfacción al verlo en
escena.
Si
no lográramos reunir los 50,000 dólares, haríamos la obra en el 2017, pero al
ser este el año del centenario de Yolanda, nos parece imprescindible hacerlo
este setiembre.
It will be a pleasure
to offer you something for your donation, because we want you to feel
satisfaction by helping this project and at the same time receive a small token
of our gratitude. The graphic artist, Lisa Sánchez, has designed a logo for our
opera (the eye you see at the beginning of this campaign), and we have placed
it on different objects: stickers, pins, t-shirts, handbags. We also have VIP
dinners in Sofia Mediterráneo Restaurant, at Barrio Escalante, and live
presentations with the singers as well as the logo of your business or
institution on a massive scale throughout San José.
The most important
thing will be a heartfelt thank you on our part to your magnanimity by
supporting this project, and the satisfaction of seeing it, finally, on the
stage.

If we are unable to
raise the $50,000 thousand dollars, we will perform it next year, but this
being Yolanda's centennial, it seems like a sheer necessity to open in
September.

¿Qué
impacto tiene este proyecto?
What impact does this project have?

Esta
es la primera ópera hecha a partir de una novela costarricense.
Es
el homenaje mayor que se le haya hecho a Yolanda Oreamuno.
Es
un aporte histórico el cambiar en la ópera los ritmos europeos por los latinos.
Es
una revelación: una ópera apta tanto para el público general como para el
especializado.
Es
un acontecimiento: una ópera financiada por la gente y no por el Estado.
Es
la primera vez que se mantendrá en repertorio una ópera de una compañía teatral
independiente.
Sin
su ayuda no será posible, pero con su aporte vamos a darle un giro a la
historia de la ópera y del teatro costarricense.
Abya
Yala no ha fallado en 25 años. Hemos creado proyectos enormes, algunos en
colaboración con artistas de tres países a la vez, hemos producido espectáculos
masivos y pequeñas joyas íntimas, y hemos mantenido viva y activa la compañía
por un cuarto de siglo, sin apoyo del Estado. Tenemos la habilidad, el talento
y la tenacidad.
This is the first
opera created adapted from a costarican novel.
This is the largest
homage to be made to Yolanda Oreamuno.
This is an historical
event changing the opera to have Latin rhythms instead of European.
It is a revelation: an
opera for both the specialized opera goers and the general public.
It is a groundbreaking
event: an opera financed by the people and not by the State.
It is the first time
an independent theater company maintains an opera in its repertoire
Without your support
it will not happen, but with your donation we will turn the wheel of Costa
Rica's theater and opera history.
Abya Yala has not
failed in 25 years. We have created enormous projects, in collaboration with
artists of three countries, we have produced massive spectacles and tiny
intimate jewels, and we have maintained alive and active the company for one
quarter of a century, without the support of the State. We have the ability,
the talent and the tenacity

¿
De cuáles otras maneras puede ayudarnos?/ In what other ways can you help us?

Si
usted ama la obra de Yolanda Oreamuno, la música de Carlos Castro, el trabajo
del Teatro Abya Yala y la ópera en general, pero no tuviera mucho dinero ¡no
importa! Ayúdenos a difundir esta campaña. Hágale bulla entre sus personas
conocidas. Dígale a las gentes que pueden donar, aunque sea un poquito, que lo
hagan. Cada contribución suma y posibilita. Si hubiera grandes colaboradores
sería genial, pero todo, absolutamente todo cuenta. Y por encima de ello cuenta
que usted se haya tomado el tiempo de leer esto, de creer en nosotros y de
apoyarnos.
¡Mil
gracias!
If you love Yolanda
Oreamuno's novel, Carlos Castro's music, the work of Abya Yala and the opera in
general but you don't have spare money. It doesn't matter! Help us spread the
word of this campaign. Tell your friends and relatives. Tell people they can
donate anything they can. If there are people who donate large it is great,
but, everything counts. And above all, what counts is you took time to read
this, believe in us and support us.

It's very discouraging but we're not going to give up despite that as near as we can calculate ASCAP and BMI owe us in the neighborhood of 18 to 20 thousand dollars that they aren't paying us. Yes, it's a lot of money, A LOT of money considering where we live. BUT we're not going to let these folks screw us out of doing the thing we love, making music. SO, we're fighting back and producing more music and another video. Help us battle against the giants that choose to ignore Indie Artist! We've even been told by booking agents that in order to get noticed we have to move from our SE Oklahoma home. That's not happening either and with your help we can make things happen!</p>
<p>If you don't know who we are then the following is our story.</p>
<p>We're a group of musicians from a rural area in SE Oklahoma. Our first album was completely recorded and produced in our home with the bare basics and it drew some attention to us. We were fortunate enough to meet a banjo player named Jimmy Henley that toured with Roy Clark for over 25 years. (Jimmy actually won an award for being the best banjo player in the world once.) He contributed to a track on our first album called ""Neurologically Poor"". Meeting him led to us being introduced to a former videographer for Hanson that believed in us enough to produce a video of our song ""Threadbare"".  The song even ended up running on ZUUS TV nationwide. </p>
<p>When The Captain Ledge Band practices our home is filled with young children running through the house. They even run into the room to dance when we start playing one of their favorite songs. We hope through our music to provide a better life and better opportunities for our families. Meeting the goal in our campaign would be a life changer for all of us.  It would provide opportunities for us and our kids that we would never have if we stay in Southeast Oklahoma. </p>
<p><strong>We think we're on the right path......</strong></p>
<p>We love living in Southeast Oklahoma. Being in the country is a great place to raise kids and to teach them about nature. We're very close to our environment and raise bees where we live. Our other passion is helping to teach people how important bees are to providing food to EVERYONE and we use our musical platform to talk to people about ways they can help save the bees.</p>
<p>Last August we were invited to attend and showcase at The Cutting Edge Music Conference in New Orleans. We took all the money we had and with a prayer in our hearts went. It was a wonderful experience and through it we met the Executive Producer from Sweetwater Studios. Sweetwater has Grammy winning Producers and Engineers on their staff and have helped produce albums for a long list of awesome and talented artist. After checking us out Sweetwater contacted us and expressed an interest in helping us complete our second album. They offered us a heck of a deal but it's money that we just don't have. </p>

<p><i>When you’ve

<p>My name is Daniel Oyinloye, and my passion is storytelling.
On March 4, 2016 I will launch my album release project with the intention of
spreading a message of storytelling, spirituality and awakening. In the three
years since my last album release, I made an effort to live life to the
fullest. During this time, I wrote tunes, ideas and reflections. It was only a
few months ago that I decided to release a compilation of those narratives in
the form of a project called “Dawn of Redemption”.</p>

<p>""<i>Dawn of Redemption is more than an
album release. It’s a storytelling journey in the making; built on sharing my
awakening and helping others discover their own. I've experienced something
profound and want to share it.</i>""</p>
<p>I am currently looking for donations to fund performances
and the album release in Duluth, the Twin Cities and San Francisco (some of the
places that inspired this album). These donations will also support my
objective goal which is to initiate a youth ministry called the “Do Right
Ministry”. A ministry with the goal of encouraging youths and their families to
do right in their communities. All support and donations are greatly

I

in the states, blacks are still getting arrested and killed because they demand
civility, immigrants still don't have access to jobs or substantial relations
without selling their home identity -- something is happening in our

Our
educational system needs an extreme makeover, which might not be possible
without breaking it down first. Imagine: a teen at 12 who already has a lengthy

Meanwhile,

We
treat ourselves with wickedness; the rich preach to the poor without helping

Have
I said enough? 
Honestly, there is so much things to say right
now: ""when the rain falls, it don't fall on one man's rooftop"" - Bob

<p>We are planning on releasing our 3rd self released EP ""Sneaky Peekers"" this summer and we need to raise funds to work with a respected PR company that were responsible for the rise of many successful bands such as Elbow.

<p>This is our third EP and we have learnt that in this business you need more than great songs to sell recordsand by working with a professional PR company we can maximise the potential of our material and get it out there into the world for people to hear.</p>
<p>PR doesn't come cheap! We need £900 for a six week campaign that will get our EP plugged to the best radio stations and online platforms, this is vital for us to get the exposure we need to release a successful EP.

<div>Hi!  My name is Brian Hernandez.  I am an independent artist/producer in the Washington DC Metropolitan area.  I have always had a passion for music ever since my childhood, I developed the gift of rapping at the age of 12 and started to produce music at 17 years old.  <br/>
</div>
<div>Two years ago I was able to launch a EP (9 track CD) thankfully with a low budget, I didn't have much knowledge of how everything worked I simply just wanted to launch my music.  Currently I am working on my first big album!  And since its a big project I need your help to fund the expenses that go with finalizing this project!  </div> </div> <div> <h3>Where Will The Money Go Towards?</h3> <p>As stated earlier, there are many expenses that go along with professionally launching a music album.  Below is a breakdown of the expenses to give you more of an idea where all the money will go towards:</p>
<p>Copyright for whole album (12 songs) - $660</p>
<p>Professional Album Mastering by Audio Animals (12 songs) - $1860</p>

</div></div>","Who am I?
Hi!  My name is Brian Hernandez.  I am an independent artist/producer in the Washington DC Metropolitan area.  I have always had a passion for music ever since my childhood, I developed the gift of rapping at the age of 12 and started to produce music at 17 years old.  

Two years ago I was able to launch a EP (9 track CD) thankfully with a low budget, I didn't have much knowledge of how everything worked I simply just wanted to launch my music.  Currently I am working on my first big album!  And since its a big project I need your help to fund the expenses that go with finalizing this project!     Where Will The Money Go Towards? As stated earlier, there are many expenses that go along with professionally launching a music album.  Below is a breakdown of the expenses to give you more of an idea where all the money will go towards:
Copyright for whole album (12 songs) - $660
Professional Album Mastering by Audio Animals (12 songs) - $1860
CD Duplication - $500-$600
Album Artwork - $500
Videos (Documentary and 2 Music Videos) - $350
Maketing/Promotion Package from Rapzilla - $2000
Travel Expenses and Radio Play - $1030
    The Purpose Many could think and say that they'll be helping me to get more publicity or fame.  But my heart is to make a difference in someones life.  The album concept is that if you want to see a change in your life, there first must be a change in your heart. And that change that I've received has come only by Jesus Christ!  And that's what I want to share with the world, speaking about real life issues that many of us face, and embrace the fact that Jesus can set us free! 

    How Can You Benefit From This? I am offering a bundle of Merchandise that I still have from the release of my EP.
Any donations that are $25 or higher will get one CD Hard Copy of the 2014 EP Release and a T-shirt that goes with it that reads ""No Limits""  *Limited Sizes Available **

I've been playing a 26-string lever harp for 3 1/2 years now, and I'm humbly asking for your help to go to the next level with a pedal harp!</div><div><br/></div><h3>Why Do You Need a Pedal Harp?</h3><div>I'm simply outgrowing the small harp that I have. Currently, many of my songs hang on C and D notes because they're the lowest notes I have. I have to use my hands to change keys, which makes it impossible to smoothly change keys while playing. On a pedal harp, I'd be able to change keys in the middle of playing a song, by using the foot pedals. Not to mention I'd have double the amount of strings to work with tonally. My connection to my instrument will deepen, because I'll be able to truly FEEL the instrument vibrate on my body- something I don't experience with my small harp. I had a truly healing experience when I played a pedal harp for the first time; the sound is incredible. Just look up ""Venus pedal harp"" on youtube and maybe you'll start drooling as much as I have been lately. Here are a few more crucial differences between the lever harp and the pedal harp:<br/>
</div><div><b>PEDAL HARP</b></div><div>~ Has 40-47 strings</div><div>~ Beautiful, big sound and much better bass response (can deeply feel it in your body)</div><div>~ Even sound across all registers, if you get a good quality instrument</div><div>~ Primarily gut strings, much more beautiful feel &amp; sound</div><div>~ Foot pedals change keys, very easy to do while playing</div><div>~ Can play in all keys</div><div>~ Stays steady on the floor so you can have healthy body technique</div><div>~ Generally very heavy and large but that allows for good technique and big sound</div><div><b>LEVER HARP</b></div><div>~ Has anywhere from 11 to 40 strings (Mine has 26)</div><div>~ Mine has a slightly twangy sound, with uneven registers (hard to feel in the body and to control during performances &amp; recording)</div><div>~ Nylon plastic strings</div><div>~ Turn levers with your hands to change keys (very difficult during playing)</div><div>~ Plays in half the possible keys</div><div>~ Smaller harps like mine are awkward to hold while playing, making proper technique nearly impossible</div><div>~ Lighter to move around than pedal harps</div><div><br/></div><h3>What Will You Do With It?</h3><div>After releasing 6 albums featuring the harp, writing over 50 songs on the harp, and playing 150+ concerts over the last few years, I've proven to myself that I'm serious about this instrument. This is an investment into my career. There aren't enough harpist singer/songwriters in the world in my opinion, and I'm excited to continue to help fill that gap! Harps are often seen in the orchestra pit or at a wedding, but there's so much more it can do. Pedal harps don't degrade in value very much if they are cared for, and I'll be able to get a wider range of work with a pedal harp - weddings, concerts, recording work, and without having to sell it, I could keep my smaller harp to teach lessons on or to rent out.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3><b>How Much Are You Asking For?</b></h3>
<p>My goal is $15,000. Pedal harps are extremely expensive instruments, ranging from $10,000-50,000 (or sometimes more!). I would have to save money for many years to be able to afford something like this, but <i>with your help, I can start performing, writing, and recording on a pedal harp this year!</i> Generally $15,000-20,000 will get you something pretty good, so the more money I raise, the better quality instrument I can afford.</p>
<p>All of the money I raise will go toward the base cost of a pedal harp. If there happens to be anything leftover, it will go towards these items: a case ($300-500), a dolly (~$350), an adjustable stool ($150-up), and a proper amplification setup ($300-1000). If I don't make my goal or come close to it, I'll either settle for a lower-end pedal harp or place the money towards a deposit, paying off the rest later. However, financing will probably not be an option for me, because of my small amount of student debt that wrecked my credit. Your help is truly needed!</p>
</div><div><br/></div><h3>What Will I Get For Donating?</h3><div>Firstly, my DEEPEST GRATITUDE!

<h3><b>A is for Artist</b></h3>
<p><b>Sammy Bravo</b> is an
NYC-based singer / songwriter. Originally from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Sammy
moved to the United States at the age of eight, first to Miami and then to
Houston. Sammy’s love for music began at the early age of three when he would
replicate jingles from television commercials and the music his mother listened
to on his toy piano. Recognizing his passion for music, his mother eventually
bought him a proper keyboard and he began playing in school and at church. His
musical abilities grew further when he joined the school band, playing the bass
clarinet. At college, he studied musical theatre and discovered a love for the
work of composers like <b>Stephen Sondheim</b>, <b>Andrew Lloyd Webber</b>, <b>Cole
Porter</b> and other greats. He started to experiment with writing his own lyrics
to their melodies, which gave way to an interest in songwriting. Sammy quickly
began writing and performing his own music which was a perfect way to merge his
love of singing with his natural musical ability. His love of Cole Porter’s
music lead him on a musical journey that started with early jazz, African
American spiritual music, and eventually Gospel and Soul. As his talent for
writing expanded, he began to blend his new musical tastes with the sounds of
favorite artists from his childhood, including <b>Selena</b>, <b>Shakira</b>, and <b>Gloria
Estefan</b>. In 2008 Sammy moved to NYC and began to seriously pursue a career in
music. Now with nearly 90 songs in his catalogue, Sammy has performed in venues
throughout New York City, including The Triad Theater, Uncle Charlie’s, The
Duplex, The Shrine World Music Venue, Sylvana,The United Palace Theater and
most recently a sold out 13 piece band showcase at The Cutting Room. Drawing
inspiration from artists such as <b>Stevie Wonder</b>, <b>Selena</b>, <b>Amy
Winehouse</b>, and <b>Erykah Badu</b>, Sammy has truly honed his unique singular sound. He
describes his music as Latin Soul and makes heavy use of brass, bass, strong
percussive rhythm, and heavy background vocals. </p>

Sammy Bravo
will return to NYC’s famed music venue, The
Cutting Room (44 E 32nd Street) on Friday, March 4, 2016 to launch the Spring leg of his upcoming tour, entitled Sammy Bravo: Love Train.

Train concert will loosely tell the story of a relationship through a
gritty, upbeat and sexy series of original songs by the NYC-based,
Honduran-born singer/songwriter.

Joining
Bravo on the Love Train tour and recording will be a 10-piece band of
talented musicians including superstar Israeli DJ, Ann Streichman, who will jump start each engagement with her own
unique brand of electronic funk.  Bravo’s
13-song set will integrate Latin, Reggae, Funk and Disco for an explosive night

Recording:</b> At this point we record all instruments, voices and any other element that will eventually become a part of the arrangement. It´s in this phase that I invete very talented musicians to join me and put some ""colors and textures"" to the sound landscapes. Until now I´ve been working with drums, bass, guitars, ukulele, violoncelo, trumpet, saxophone, berimbau, hang drum, percussion, vintage keyboards and synthesizers.  </p><b>3. Mixing &amp; Mastering:</b> Each track will get mixed to create the right balance between instruments, texture and color that make up a track.

Pré- Produção: A aventura começa aqui! Reúno-me com o produtor, fazemos uma revisão das músicas já compostas e delineamos um esboço dos arranjos para cada uma das músicas. É nesta primeira etapa que traçamos mapas estruturais que irão guiar todos os músicos envolvidos no projeto, desta forma, rentabilizamos melhor o tempo de gravação em estúdio e clarificamos os objetivos para cada uma das músicas.2. Gravação: Esta é a etapa na qual gravamos todos os instrumentos, vozes e quaisquer outros elementos que farão parte dos arranjos musicais. É nesta fase que convido músicos talentosos para adicionarem ""cor e textura"" às paisagens sonoras. Até agora tenho trabalhado com baixo, bateria, teclados vintage, ukulele, hang drum, berimbau, trompete, saxofone, percussão, violoncelo, guitarra, violão e sintetizadores. 3. Mistura e Masterização: Nesta fase, todas as músicas passam por um processo de equalização no qual o volume dos instrumentos, texturas e dinâmicas são balanceados de forma a criar um ambiente equilibrado, dando vida a uma entidade única. Como etapa final, as faixas do album passam pelo processo de masterização, que consiste em revisar todo o material com o objetivo de apurar a qualidade do que foi produzido e utilizar ferramentas para colocar o áudio dentro dos padrões necessários para replicá-lo.Logicamente, o aspecto econômico não é a única forma de participar, a ajuda em difundir esta campanha é igualmente importante!I spend countless hours studying, finding inspiration, creating original songs and researching the best way to put everything collectively together. So, to carry out this project, there is always the financial aspect related to an album production process.All recording process has been made at Estudio Verde, Belo Horizonte, oriented by the producer Robertinho Brant, which has many collaborations with great talents of brazilian music such as Seu Jorge, Bebel Gilberto, Milton Nascimento, Beto Guedes, Toninho Horta, Nivaldo Ornelas, Jaques Morelembaum, Boca Livre, Lô Borges and Marina Machado.In order to support the high costs related to a top quality work, I came up with the idea to create a virtual space in which those who feels like, can contribute through donation, to implement this idea.So, your donation will cover the following costs:1. Pre-Production: This is where the journey begins! I meet the producer, we start to review all original song ideas and draw an arrangement sketch for each of these tracks. Here we map out the music´s structures to guide all musicians and ensure a maximum use of the studio and establish clear goals for each song before we start recording.2. Recording: At this point we record all instruments, voices and any other element that will eventually become a part of the arrangement. It´s in this phase that I invete very talented musicians to join me and put some ""colors and textures"" to the sound landscapes. Until now I´ve been working with drums, bass, guitars, ukulele, violoncelo, trumpet, saxophone, berimbau, hang drum, percussion, vintage keyboards and synthesizers.  3. Mixing & Mastering: Each track will get mixed to create the right balance between instruments, texture and color that make up a track. As a final step, the album will be mastered from beginning to end, so the listening experience is cohesive and carefully choreographed from start to finish.  Of course, the economic aspect is not the only way to participate, all help on spreading this campaign is also very important!Tenho o prazer de oferecer packs de ""recompensa"" como forma de demonstrar minha gratidão pela auxilio em seguir com este sonho. É para mim uma felicidade muito grande poder partilhar com todos este universo sonoro que há muito permeia meu ser!****************************************************************************I am pleased to offer packages of ""reward"" as a way to show my gratitude for your assistance in following with this dream.

<h3>Join Jason Simonds as he produces his debut CD!</h3>Some things are a long time in coming, and so it is with this CD project. Jason formed the Wicked Blues Band in 2012 with the goal of writing and singing his own music and for a little over two years, that is just what happened. During this time he and his initial band members worked on the Maine club scene where Jason worked on his stage presence and polished his style and wrote many songs.  A very prolific writer, Jason cranks out lyrics faster than he can put them to music, and getting these works recorded is a major goal.  This CD project will feature at least 11 of his original songs (probably more, oh heck who are we kidding, there are over 20 originals that the band is playing now!) in a studio recording project with a release date of late winter of 2017.<br/> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458097262/wgsmprq7xnh6vlywfl4s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/><br/><b>What We Need</b><br/><br/>The ""Wicked"" group has the talent and the material, but we will need a little help to fund this project. In order to bring out a CD, fees have to be paid in advance to cover the costs of manufacturing the and paying for things like UPC codes, inclusion in distribution through online outlets, and for downloadable purchases of the CD. There are also studio musicians to pay for recording sessions.  The target is to raise at least $2500.  </p>
<p><br/>The funds raised will be used to in part to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording space</li>
<li>Artwork preparation</li>
<li>Photography</li>
<li>CD &amp; case production and printing</li>
<li>CD Posters for use in retail selling and promoting.</li>

<p>Jason operates a venture called Bunker Hill Sound and has been providing sound and recording services since 2014. What this means to the project is that the recording process will take place ""in house"" and that the many thousands of dollars normally required to record and mix  a project of this nature will not be needed.  It is Jason's goal to pay all musicians a session fee, along with being able to bring in some very special guests. When the campaign reaches its goal, much of the funding will be used to help manufacture and market the CD to radio and other media sources locally, nationally and internationally. Your support makes all this possible! You can help make a dream come true.</p>
<p><br/><strong>A Little Back Story</strong></p>
<p>This is quite a leap. Imagine yourself at the age of 50+ deciding that you want to be a singer of blues and record your own songs. Jason's past is filled with being on stage acting, singing and even dancing! He has filled lead roles in many plays singing to large and small audiences, but he will tell you that being out in front of a band, singing your own songs is such a totally different experience than acting out a role.  As he contemplated this path back in 2011, Jason started feeling out his potential singing at open mics and even (gasp) Karaoke. Once enough people had told him he needed to do more with his singing, he sought out musicians to form a band and to get the show on the road.</p>
</div><p>Developing an onstage presence is a thought provoking process according to Jason.  He felt it was crucial to his music, to not ""put on the performer suit"" when he went on stage, but to allow himself to grow into his stage skin as an extension, or amplification, of himself. He says that the blues is a way of life. What he means by this is, the blues is the expression of those deepest feelings, the ones that thrill us and the ones that bring us crashing down. He is now ready to share his version of the blues with the world. Your support will allow this dream to become reality.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458097306/bwftldewdwgqscz4yyxv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/><b>Jason Says </b>""<i>It has been a lot of hard work, getting to this point.

Jason formed the Wicked Blues Band in 2012 with the goal of writing and singing his own music and for a little over two years, that is just what happened. During this time he and his initial band members worked on the Maine club scene where Jason worked on his stage presence and polished his style and wrote many songs.  A very prolific writer, Jason cranks out lyrics faster than he can put them to music, and getting these works recorded is a major goal.  This CD project will feature at least 11 of his original songs (probably more, oh heck who are we kidding, there are over 20 originals that the band is playing now!) in a studio recording project with a release date of late winter of 2017. 
What We NeedThe ""Wicked"" group has the talent and the material, but we will need a little help to fund this project. In order to bring out a CD, fees have to be paid in advance to cover the costs of manufacturing the and paying for things like UPC codes, inclusion in distribution through online outlets, and for downloadable purchases of the CD. There are also studio musicians to pay for recording sessions.  The target is to raise at least $2500.  
The funds raised will be used to in part to pay for:

Recording space
Artwork preparation
Photography
CD & case production and printing
CD Posters for use in retail selling and promoting.
Session Musicians Fees
Mastering Fees

<b>Dear friends and supporters of Sahara
Blues!</b> <br/>I'm ready to record a new album. After my first solo album
from 2012, <i>Anewal</i>, my journey as a 'walking man' continues. From
Niamey to Berlin and back to the Sahara.<br/><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Who am I? </b><br/><br/>My name
is <b>Alhousseini Mohamed Anivolla</b> a.k.a. <b>Anewal</b>, which means 'walking man' and I am the lead singer and
guitarist of the internationally known Desert Blues band <b>Etran
Finatawa</b> from Niger. Since 2004 I have toured with them around the
globe. Together we made four successful CDs for the British label
<i>World Music Network</i>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 2012 I made my first solo album
<i>Anewal</i>, a diary of my travels around the world and back again
into the wilderness. It received international critical acclaim and
<i>Songlines</i> magazine recently listed it as one of the '10 best
Desert Blues' albums. <br/></p>
<p>Since then it seems the world is changing faster
than ever, sweeping us along like a flood. I have written a
collection of new songs inspired by these changes and the need to
speak out and communicate a message of peace and understanding.</p>
<p>In my songs I sing of the loss of
cultural diversity throughout the world, social changes, climate
change and the direct impact of these global effects on the people of
my homeland as well as the importance of keeping our culture, our way
of life, alive, strong and relevant. <br/>My music is rooted in
tradition. My music gives me strength. I would like to share this
feeling with you through my new songs on a new album. Previously I
have always worked with a record company but today the music industry
is in crisis and many labels can no longer even offer to cover the
costs. So I have decided to create the album myself, from recording
to pressing. 
</p>
<p>And I'm making this campaign to ask you
to help me finance it and share in the creative process!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>The Project</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Whatever the
outcome of the campaign, the album will be made. The process is already under way! My new
songs are ready and in June I will travel to Wales to record the new
album with my friend Colin Bass as producer at Wild End Studio.
Travel, studio time for recording and mixing will be the initial
expenses. 
</p>
<p>After mixing there will be further
costs for cover design, lay-outing and printing CDs. With your help
I'm hoping to cover all these production costs. And if we get past
the target I'll be able to employ someone to help promote the album
across the media. All in all, the more support I can get, the more
chance I will have to reach people with my music.</p>
<p>I hope you will join with me to help
realise this very exciting project. Have a look at the 'perks' and
make your own choice, whether for a digital download, a CD, signed
copies, a signed cover photo, your name in the booklet or having your
name in the album cover credits as executive producer!</p>

<p>All help is appreciated and I look

Just a few weeks ago our production team even traveled to Los Angeles to capture Single Sessions. </p>
<p>We're at a pivotal moment with Amplify and we have even more opportunities to spotlight artists in different cities. That's why we've decided to take Amplify on the road this July, hitting as many cities as we can between Nashville, TN and Boston, MA in a three week period. This is the first time we've ever done something on this kind of scale, and we're very excited. We do, however, need your help to get us started.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p>Photographer Eric Garrison will travel to Nepal to document the production of the first western opera ever produced in Nepal.  On the first trip he will accompany the production team as they scout locations for the production, audition local talent, meet and hire local artisans and craftsmen to create sets, provide vocal workshops to local students, opera lectures for the local community, and more. Not only will the photographs tell the tale of the production, but also will tell the visual stories of the community that the production impacts.  </p>
<p>Later in the year Eric will travel back to Nepal to document the actual production of the opera itself. Eric plans to create a documentary photobook that also may include stories from the production team and others involved in the production of Arjuna's Dilemma.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Photographer </h3>
<p>Eric  is a photographer living and working in Shanghai, China.  He specializes in street and documentary photography.

<p>Enough funding has been secured to ensure that production takes place, however we would like to spread awareness before, during and after the production in order to support the people of Kathmandu and Nepal as a whole as well as to further support this exciting production.  To achieve this the production team would like a documentary photographer present and part of the production.

</div></div>","Brief Summary 
Photographer Eric Garrison will travel to Nepal to document the production of the first western opera ever produced in Nepal.  On the first trip he will accompany the production team as they scout locations for the production, audition local talent, meet and hire local artisans and craftsmen to create sets, provide vocal workshops to local students, opera lectures for the local community, and more. Not only will the photographs tell the tale of the production, but also will tell the visual stories of the community that the production impacts.  
Later in the year Eric will travel back to Nepal to document the actual production of the opera itself. Eric plans to create a documentary photobook that also may include stories from the production team and others involved in the production of Arjuna's Dilemma.

<p>Despite my slow development to master the keys, my voice had not ever let me down.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Even after puberty I found that I could still reach some pretty high notes.  But having a high voice during those teen years turned into a pretty brutal experience. I'd be ridiculed and teased often because of it which would ultimately keep me from performing at all.  My confidence was so bruised that I developed severe anxiety and stage fright.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It wasn't until high school that I would find confidence in performing again after auditioning for an advanced choral group. I was eventually asked to write and perform music for an original high school musical. Although I knew music would be the avenue I needed to follow toward fulfillment I struggled a bit after graduation to find my footing or my place in the world.  Insecurity and eventually depression got the best of me and I settled for anything to make a living.</span></p>

This is what I wish to share with you.  In honor of those you would not let me give up, even when I felt I wanted to.   </span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The campaign is to record an EP, which is a compilation of 6 original songs that will be available for free after it is recorded.  Recording and releasing this EP will give me the opportunity to get my music out there to the people who've continued to encourage me and hopefully to new fans who just appreciate good music.  The EP will be entitled 'Different' and is named after one of my most personal songs.  I struggled as a child, trying to find exactly where I fit in. I want this to be more than a song with catchy lyrics, but an anthem for anyone who needs an affirmation that it is absolutely ok just being yourself.  </p>
<p>Industry standard for mastering is generally around $100-$150 per track (estimated costs, $900). A mix engineer that will spend a 8 hours per song, will probably charge about $50 an hour (estimated costs, $2400). One can expect to pay $250-$500 per song to a producer (estimated costs, $3000). Potential budget will be a bit over $6000. <br/></p>
<p>To completely fund this project, I will need to raise $6000.  With the money you pledge, in addition to receiving the free download of the album, there will be something special in exchange for every donation you contribute.  I'm giving away everything from T-shirts with the printed 'Different' logo, to signed posters and free tickets to a live performance, featuring yours truly and a live band.  </p>

<p>Durante mis años de colegio comencé a jugar y explorar
componiendo canciones. Los temas “La Respuesta Está En Tí” que habla de la lucha contra las drogas y el himno  “Tu
y Yo Por Ellos” que nació en una Vigilia de Jose Engling, marcaron una línea en mí de expresar a través de la música ideales como joven Católico Cristiano, plasmar en la música vivencias
tanto personales como de comunidad, y tratar de vivir mi espiritualidad de manera creativa.</p>

<br/></div>","TU MIRADA ME DICE: ""AQUI ESTOY, DEJATE AMAR"" - Hijo Mío (2007)
Mi nombre es Francisco Ruiz, soy cantante, compositor y educador musical. 
Hijo Mío es mi primer album completo, dedicado a toda mi familia de Schoenstatt en Ecuador, y de Latinoamérica.



Durante mis años de colegio comencé a jugar y explorar
componiendo canciones. Los temas “La Respuesta Está En Tí” que habla de la lucha contra las drogas y el himno  “Tu
y Yo Por Ellos” que nació en una Vigilia de Jose Engling, marcaron una línea en mí de expresar a través de la música ideales como joven Católico Cristiano, plasmar en la música vivencias
tanto personales como de comunidad, y tratar de vivir mi espiritualidad de manera creativa.


La música tiene un poder impresionante. Actualmente trabajo
en una Fundación en el centro-sur de Los Angeles con chicos de 8 a 21 años que
viven en constante exposición a drogas, pandillas, abuso en el hogar, etc.
Muchos te comentan que su amor y compromiso a un instrumento musical o a la composición o producción, literalmente les salvó la vida.


La música es el medio de desahogo para muchos, y he sido
testigo de cuántas vidas han sido salvadas gracias a la disciplina y constancia
que la música inspira en la vida de estos jóvenes. El trabajar día a día con ellos despertó en mí el anhelo de
terminar éste disco que espero ayude a muchos jóvenes a seguir sus anhelos, a
sentirse amados por Dios y reasegurar que en su vida existe un plan perfecto y
un propósito en constante movimiento.



Lo Que Necesitamos, Y Lo Que TÚ Recibes
Mucha gente no es consciente del gran sacrificio y esfuerzo
que es sacar un disco adelante para un musico independiente. Ahi es donde
juegas TU:
Con tu apoyo podrémos terminar de cubrir los costos del estudio de grabacion, músicos,
ingenieros, mezcla, masterizacion y por ultimo la impresion y distribución
tanto fisica como digital del Album Hijo Mío. El album contará con 12 temas,  10 en español 1 en ingles y 1 en portugués.

<br/><p></p></div>","Bien chers jeunes et moins jeunes, Voici venu le temps du second album...Et voici venu le temps de m'adresser à vous (faut pas compter sur mes deux petits protégés pour ça, ils sont trop couards).Pourquoi me direz-vous, oui, pourquoi Monsieur toto lui-même sort-il de son bien aimé salon pour s'adresser aux petites gens ?Et bien, même si je répugne à l'admettre, Monsieur toto (à savoir moi donc) a besoin de VOUS !""De NOUS ?"" vous entends-je déjà vous exclamer !Et bien oui !En effet, mes deux larbins et MOI avons travaillé d'arrache-pieds ces derniers mois afin de vous concocter un 33Tours varié, aux tempos divers, aux ambiances sombrement claires voir clairement obscures. Un nouvel album comportant non moins que 14 titres écrits à deux ou 4 mains, tantôt acoustiques, tantôt électriques ou électroniques, bref, un disque qui, sans renier son prédécesseur, explore de nouveaux horizons, agrandit son spectre sonore.Après avoir oeuvré dans l'ombre, il est maintenant temps pour nous de passer en studio mixer tout ça, de faire masteriser le résultat afin que le disque passe bien partout...que ce soit à la TSF ou sur vos cassettophones, voir, pour les drogués de la modernité, sur vos disques compacts...Disques compacts qui d'ailleurs seront ensuite produits en 300 exemplaires, le tout dans un bel écrin digipack (ne me demandez pas ce que c'est...en gros ce sera comme celui d'avant mais en mieux encore d'après ce qu'on m'a dit). C'est pourquoi nous vous proposons de contribuer à cette oeuvre magistrale ( à ne pas confondre avec le jambon du même nom) en commandant un de nos packs que nous avons spécialement conçus pour vous !Ceux-ci, en plus d'être de merveilleux cadeaux, serviront à payer le mixage, le mastering, le pressage des cds, la promotion de l'album ainsi que les clips vidéo qui l'accompagneront. Un grand merci déjà à ceux qui nous aideront dans cette aventure !Signé: Monsieur totoPS: Si vous ne nous connaissez que peu, n'hésitez pas à faire un tour par notre ""gallerie"" (photos/videos) sur cette page !Les champs réservés aux pack sur la droite de l'écran étant limités à 500 caractères, voici une présentation plus claire de ce qu'ils contiennent !PACK MAURICE CHEVALIER-1 euro---------------------------------Votre nom dans les remerciements de l'album

Primarily playing the music of the 70's, the leader Toshi Clinch, decided to branch out and challenge the band with new material. This developed into a conversation with Thani (a friend and fellow musician) in early June 2015, and has now evolved into a major studio production.</span></p>
<p>We are excited to present this unique collaboration, and are looking to make the album at the highest possible quality. Because of the required demands to make such a high quality album, we are in need of additional funds.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In total, we are looking at $7000 USD to fund everything for the album. This money will be going towards 28 hours in the studio, HD video recording of the entire 28 hours (which will be edited into an hour long DVD), album artwork, video editing, mixing and mastering, marketing, and much more. Regardless of the amount we will make, all of the money will be used towards these goals.</p>
<p>So now we can get onto what you will get out of donating! We want every person that donates, from the smallest to largest contributions to be recognized. Because of this your name will be included in the liner notes of the album. After that, depending on the price range we have a variety of unique perks available. </p>
<p>For packages over $100 we have not created additional perks just yet. But if you plan on donating more than $100, then Toshi and Thani will contact you personally and work out additional benefits for you!</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>

<p><b></b></p><p><b>Bible Belt</b></p><p>Hello, friends. In case you’re wondering what this is, I’m cookin’ up my very first full-length album, being released under <a href=""http://www.hortonrecords.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Horton Records</a>. It is called Bible Belt, based on experiences and people living in my good ol’ home state of Oklahoma.

    The ImpactArt, in any form, is a priceless treasure yet we desperately try to sell it every day.  Music especially, is almost something you can't even sell anymore, as it is available for free in so many ways and through so many outlets.  The reality of it is that it still costs money to put it out there, whether you'll make money on the product or not.  I have no expectations for ""Outlaw In Love"" to make me any notable amount of money.  All I want is to be able to release it to the world, so you all can enjoy the music and hopefully be inspired in some way, as I am by artists I love.  You helping us make this last small bit of funds, will make that possible.  This video is a throwback to December 2014, when the album conception was finalized and we started spreading the word about the new music to come.
 

  Other Ways You Can Help I know some of you can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Spread the word!  Share, comment on the actual campaign, Tweet, Facebook, Google +, email your friends, tell people about the music and why its important for us to make our goal.  
 Use the Indiegogo share tools!  You can share the campaign directly from this page.  Also, please leave us comments on the campaign page as it raises our ranking in the Indiegogo community and shows people what we're about!
   And that's all there is to it. It's all about spreading the love of music and the possibilities are endless!  Thank you so much for helping me in my journey to release this album that is very dear to my heart.  I want you all to enjoy it with me :)",4.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<p>As we set out to celebrate the 30th Anniversary of 'Alpha &amp; Omega', I believe that time has finally come. We will be playing a string of concerts in the Netherlands and we'll record these performances in order to have the foundation of what will become a re-recording of 'Alpha &amp; Omega'. It will be quite the undertaking: a 60-piece choir (led by Dutch director Maarten Wassink) and a full band with top musicians from the UK &amp; the Netherlands (including past &amp; present members of IONA: Dave Bainbridge, Frank van Essen and David Fitzgerald). And all of it presented with spectacular sound and lights! </p>
<p>Not only do I cherish the opportunity to present you this work in a way that I feel will be more 'current' sounding, I also believe this work's core message rings all the more true today in our time of conflict and turmoil.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>Getting a proper live recording is a challenge in and of itself. Getting this project made the way we have always hoped it could be, will require even more! This is why we need your help. With your contributions, we will be able to gather the necessary funds for what is, in essence, a 'two-step' approach:</p>
<p><b>1) Fund the live recordings. This will include musicians, producers, editing and mixing fees, manufacturing and design costs.</b></p>
<p><b>2) Expand on the live takes by adding soundscapes, effects and studio takes that will bring the full vision of 'Alpha &amp; Omega' to life!</b></p>
<p>Of course, there´s also added costs like the percentage Indiegogo gets from collected funds, bank fees and postage.  </p>
<p>To be frank: our initial goal covers step 1. Any and all funds we manage to collect on top of that, will contribute to making step 2 a reality. This is why we hope you will join us and invite your friends along! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Join us on the journey</h2>
<p>We plan to do much more than simply collect funds through a campaign. For us, this project is a journey that we hope to share with you in more ways than one. This is why we have set up a number of perks that allow you to be involved in numerous ways, from getting a unique 'behind the scenes' look to never-before-heard live audio to being added as an executive co-producer on the finished album!</p>

<blockquote>(Performance of 'Alpha &amp; Omega' in The Netherlands, 1986)</blockquote>
<p>Throughout this campaign, we will post regular updates for all pledgers and I´ll share thoughts and stories from the orginal work, as well as the many musicians and singers who make this possible. 'Alpha &amp; Omega' has been (and still is!) performed by choirs around the world, meaning literally thousands of people have a personal experience with the project. I hope to help you relive that experience, enhance it or introduce you to what I believe is a culturally and spiritually relevant work: especially now.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Thank you!</h2>
<p>Well, there you have it. From the bottom of my heart: thank you for either being a supporter of my work throughout the years or getting involved now. Thank you for contributing. Or, if you cannot but wish to be involved anyway, for spreading the word on social media with your family &amp; friends. Reach out to those choir members you know appreciate the project, post links on Facebook and Twitter... whatever you do, helps us! This campaign page offers you several tools to share.</p>
<p>In the current music 'industry', the connection between a musician / composer and his audience is more important than ever. I actually dislike the term 'industry', as it often diminishes and obscures the pure intentions behind music. Your involvement does much more than enable me to do what I do: it reminds me of the intentions and personal impact that music has, time and again. There is no greater gift in creativity.</p>

<h3>About the ""CEO"" Video Project</h3>
<p>Do you love music? And, are you like me, and want more music videos that really tell a story? I'm Aradia, a fully independent alternative electropop artist who sings about my observations of the world &amp; aims to inspire and empower listeners. One of the most powerful ways to change perceptions &amp; spread ideas is through visual media, and that's why making this music video is so important to me.</p>
<p>As a true DIY musician, I do everything myself, from writing &amp; recording to costumes &amp; videos. Getting heard &amp; building an audience takes - first &amp; foremost - great material, and just as important: exposure. You can help me achieve this goal by contributing to this campaign.</p>
<p>Most of my music focuses on what makes us the same, but I have a current single, titled “CEO,” that focuses on the position of women in the entertainment industry, and the challenges of finding true success as an independent musician. The goal of this campaign is to make a fun, cheeky video for “CEO” that illustrates how an artist can stand in her own power in a positive way, and be successful by believing in herself &amp; working hard. I'm excited to share the power of “CEO” with you! With its New Wave-infused electronic pop style, this song is sure to get you dancing!</p>
<p> </p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make the ""CEO"" music video, we need at least $7,500 in funding. I'm starting there with the goal of keeping costs down, while making a video with tons of production value. <strong>Costs include</strong>: Location shooting rentals (stage set and street shots; roughly $55/hr for a 3 day shoot), props, stage light rentals, casting actors, production insurance, food for actors &amp; extras, makeup/hair artist, grip/camera crew, and more. If I don't reach my entire goal, I'll still make the video! I'll cut costs by limiting the days of shooting, as well as locations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Making a professional video has its potential risks. I like to plan carefully and keep things simple to avoid any pitfalls, but hey, you never know :-)  Some risks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shoots getting canceled</li>
<li>Actors not showing up</li>
<li>Equipment failures</li>
<li>Film crew tantrums &amp; other random shenanigans</li>
</ul>
<p>But I'm creative! I always come up with ways to fill in the gaps. Sometimes things turn out better that way. It's like Bob Ross said, ""There are no mistakes, only happy accidents!""</p>

Costs include: Location shooting rentals (stage set and street shots; roughly $55/hr for a 3 day shoot), props, stage light rentals, casting actors, production insurance, food for actors & extras, makeup/hair artist, grip/camera crew, and more. If I don't reach my entire goal, I'll still make the video! I'll cut costs by limiting the days of shooting, as well as locations.

Risks & Challenges
Making a professional video has its potential risks. I like to plan carefully and keep things simple to avoid any pitfalls, but hey, you never know :-)  Some risks include:

Shoots getting canceled
Actors not showing up
Equipment failures
Film crew tantrums & other random shenanigans

But I'm creative! I always come up with ways to fill in the gaps. Sometimes things turn out better that way. It's like Bob Ross said, ""There are no mistakes, only happy accidents!""

<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
</div><p>This is singer Jim Gillette. When Nitro first got together, guitar virtuoso Michael Angelo Batio and I set out to build the band we'd always envisioned. A band of amazing musicians that combined everything we loved about aggressive Heavy Metal. That band became known as NITRO. We stormed onto the Los Angeles music scene like a ""Freight Train"" with our over-the-top, in-your-face brand of Metal. People didn’t know what hit them!</p><p><strong>Off The Rails</strong></p><p>NITRO got signed after performing only 1 show (at Gazzarri's on the Sunset Strip) and soon afterwards, started to record our first album ""OFR."" We were excited that being in the Hollywood Glam Metal scene, where bands basically sounded the same, we were different and getting attention for our musicianship and more aggressive sound. Unfortunately, that’s when the ""Freight Train"" went down the wrong track. The ""suits"" started to change our vision and eventually pushed NITRO in a direction that they thought would be more profitable. The rest is history.</p><p><strong>On the Siding</strong></p><p>After NITRO disbanded, Michael began a successful solo career and travels the world doing solo Guitar shows, continuing his legacy as the ""No. 1 Shredder of all time."" I became a Fighter. Teaching and competing in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I also became a Father, raising two amazing young men. Michael and I remained very close friends and continued to write music together every now and then. We never really felt that we achieved that goal of the ultimate Metal band. We felt that the time was right to resurrect our dream and put together the band that we had always envisioned.</p><p><strong>Reinventing, Revolutionizing and Rebuilding The Machine</strong></p><p>In August of 2016, Michael and I began planning the rebirth of NITRO. We knew that we had to create something really special and could not repeat the mistakes that lead this ""Freight Train"" down the wrong track. It's time to make NITRO the aggressive, brutal, and technical Metal band that we always envisioned - on our terms. That meant putting together a team that shared the same vision. We knew that getting the ultimate Metal Drummer was a top priority. Only one Drummer's name came to mind - Chris Adler. As a founding member of Lamb Of God, Chris managed to rack up several Grammy nominations. Chris has also played and recorded with many other heavy hitters like Testament and Megadeth, is a constant staple on the cover of all the major drum magazines, and has been voted “Drummer of the Year” multiple times.</p><p><strong>Refueling and stoking the boilers</strong></p><p>To restart the engine, we need fuel in the form of money to get this project restarted and running at full speed as soon as possible. This is where you come in.  Our fundraiser is to create the first and only Nitro album that is 100% our vision, on our terms, and with the music the way we've always wanted.  But this album is not just for us. It's also for you! Nothing would make us happier than to give you that record! It's going to be an extremely expensive task to record an album like this. Not having a record company looking over our shoulders, telling us what to do,  will be a blessing and at the same time, our biggest challenge.  I've always taken challenges head on and put every ounce of strength and passion into reach my goal. Michael and Chris are the same.</p><p><strong>Full speed ahead</strong></p><p>By participating in our fundraiser, not only do you qualify for Perks, but you get to act as an Executive Producer for an independent record company! You are helping us to fund everything that goes into producing the best possible music that we can create. The team is secure and with your help, NITRO is ready to do everything it takes to push Metal to the extreme. Musically there are no limits - there are ""No Boundaries.""</p><p><strong>WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU? (WHAT YOU GET FOR HELPING US)</strong></p><p><strong>Lot’s of original collector’s items!</strong></p><p>Funding our goal will give us the ability to realize our musical vision. If we exceed our goal, we will invest the extra money exclusively into this new album! Additional music videos, radio promotion, more merchandise - everything possible. We have detailed every aspect of the budget so you get an exact idea of what we are doing and what the cost's are.  Again, this campaign allows us to make the best album we can, write songs to the best of our abilities, work with the top people in the music industry and give you our finest performances.</p><p>All merchandise is currently being designed exclusively for this campaign. We have some <strong>retro</strong> items up now and will update as new items are available. Once they’re gone they will never be re released, reprinted, or duplicated the way they're available here. These are collectors items!</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>By taking part in this campaign, you are taking charge and helping us make an historic new album. You are putting faith in us to come through and deliver the greats (and no that wasn't a typo.) We won't deliver the ""goods"" because you deserve much better than good. You deserve great and that's exactly what we will deliver. A great new Nitro release!</p><p>With this in mind, we give you our word that we will not settle, we won't take any shortcuts, and above all – all the money we raise in this campaign will be used to make the best album we can.</p><p>Thank you for helping us make it possible.</p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>If you aren't sure you can commit – there are other ways you can help spread the word. Tell your family and friends and let them know what's going on.

<p>Your ongoing support of my music as both Super XX Man and Silver Scooter has enabled me to do so much over the years and I love you for it. Here we go again! Please consider making a pledge today! You can help me produce my brand new Scott Garred ""little tiny things"" LP just by making a small financial contribution.  </p>
<p>As you can appreciate, making music is a passion for me and one that requires resources I just don't have without asking for help. </p>
<p>This project is also special because it reunites a very dear group of friends. I joined Shawn Camp and Tom Hudson (both of Silver Scooter fame) in Austin, TX at the beautiful Idler Recording operated by Tyler Mallory (also ex-Silver Scooter) who recorded and mixed most of the songs. Dave McNair (Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Los Lobos, Willie Nelson, and of course Silver Scooter) was enlisted to mix the hit songs and master all the material available for perks. The songs sound amazing and I couldn't be happier.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is needed:</h3>
<p>Total goal: $7500 - This will pay for the completion of the album and help pay for the manufacturing of the LPs. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<p>When the campaign has reached 60% all backers will receive several unreleased Silver Scooter demos and live recordings from the early days. Everyone will be rewarded regardless of what level you pledged. The recordings (original 4 track cassette) have not seen the light of day ever! Some of these are of great quality and some of them are of... well you know... 'can I get more vocals in the monitor?'</p>
<p>Please consider sharing this campaign in your social media posts.</p>

I joined Shawn Camp and Tom Hudson (both of Silver Scooter fame) in Austin, TX at the beautiful Idler Recording operated by Tyler Mallory (also ex-Silver Scooter) who recorded and mixed most of the songs. Dave McNair (Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Los Lobos, Willie Nelson, and of course Silver Scooter) was enlisted to mix the hit songs and master all the material available for perks. The songs sound amazing and I couldn't be happier.

What is needed:
Total goal: $7500 - This will pay for the completion of the album and help pay for the manufacturing of the LPs. 


When the campaign has reached 60% all backers will receive several unreleased Silver Scooter demos and live recordings from the early days. Everyone will be rewarded regardless of what level you pledged. The recordings (original 4 track cassette) have not seen the light of day ever! Some of these are of great quality and some of them are of... well you know... 'can I get more vocals in the monitor?'
Please consider sharing this campaign in your social media posts.
Also, join me at scottgarred.com/blog to see what I'm up to. I'm recording songs and making videos in my VW Westy. I'm about to tour as well. Lots to share and celebrate.

</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p> A ""Denielle Bassels"" <i>(pronounced BASS-elles</i>) is a rare breed of songstress whose souls perch from their music.

<p><b>Hello supporters and fans! </b></p>
<p>For the past 2 years I've been writing, arranging and recording my first full length original album, and after a ton of sweat, rivers of tears, and plenty of setbacks, this beautiful album is finished and ready to share!  </p>
<p>My goal was to create a new kind of jazz that seamlessly fused my diverse musical influences. From Nina Simone and Ella Fitzgerald, to 60's Northern Soul, Rockabilly, and Indie. I wanted to create music that was out of the box, and that embraced and entwined the dark, silly, dreamy depths of my mind. Thanks to my dear friend Mike Mathieson; my co-writer, co-producer and engineer extraordinaire, who pushed me past my limits and stretched me further than I ever imagined I could go.  This album is truly all I thought it would be and more.  And I can't wait for you to get your hands on it!</p>
<p><b>A wee bit of history..</b> </p>
<p>I found the musician in me while working as an Au Pair (that's a fancy word for nanny) in Switzerland, when some musicians showed me around to the jazz caves and threw me up on stage one night.  We made up some songs up on the spot and I was swept off my feet by jazz and improv.  Singing with such talented and diverse artists made me hungry for new music skills, so I flew back to Canada to study composition, arranging, rhythm etc. I enrolled in Humber College's music program and got in! There I met my amazing band; Joe Ryan, Jacob Gorzhaltsan, Andy Mac, and Scott Hunter, I have been playing with them ever since and am so grateful they could all contribute their incredible talents to my album!</p>
<p>In 2014, my original song ""Cool Cool Water"" won grand prize in the Jazz Category of the John Lennon Song Competition and I took it as a sign that I was indeed on the right path.  Phew!.</p>
<p>Shortly after, I wrote, created, sang and poured my entire self into the making of this album.  I was priviledged to work with my amazing band, and was also graced with guest appearances from the incredible musicianship of Aline Homzy (Violin), Andrew McCansh (Trumpet), PJ Anderson (Trombone), and two gorgeous accompanying singers, Meg Contini and Lydia Persaud.</p>
<p>I am now so proud to present to you my first original full-length album:<br/><br/><b><u>""What About Wool Wishbags""</u></b><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>But We're Not Quite There Yet!!</h3>
<p><b>We need a total of $6800 to master, manufacture, and launch my CD into the world.</b></p>
<p>The album is written, recorded and mixed. The band is rehearsing for the release. The artwork is gorgeous thanks to, Keren and Avi Gorzhaltsan, who listened to the music and created amazing paintings for the front and back covers. I'm doing the graphic design myself and the lyric art. It's so close!  </p>
<p>You can help me reach the <b>final level!</b></p>
<p><b>Level 1.  $2000</b>  gets the album <strong>mastered</strong>, and ready for manufacturing</p>
<p><b>Level 2. $4500 </b> gets the above plus <b>1000 manufactured CD's</b> and a <strong>lyric</strong><b> video </b>made for  the first single.</p>
<p><b>Level 3. $6800</b> gets promotion to <b>press</b> and <b>radio, </b>so that the music I poured my soul into is able to reach as many ears as possible.</p>
<p>If we are lucky enough to exceed our financial goal, the extra funds will go towards the launch.  There are always surprise costs when launching an album, so the surplus will soften those blows!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>The Impact</h3>
<p>- A Canadian made album that barters with the boundaries of jazz and indie music.  <br/>- New music 100% artist owned and created.  <br/>- An album that goes over and beyond to make your experience extra special from the writing and production, to the CD package filled with hand-drawn art and lyrics.<br/>- And for me personally; music is my life's journey, and to have the feet that this album could give me will have the most dramatic impact on how far I'm able to go.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks are that I won't raise enough money to create the video or to promote the release properly.</p>
<ul><li>If this is the case, I will fall to my great team of friends, and family to help me push this album with some love and a lot of extra elbow grease.  I'll go door to door if I have to.  There is no stopping me!!</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you've read this far - thank you!  Just look to the right and see which pledge package fits your lifestyle the best. If you can't afford the minimum amount to pledge, that means your probably a musician too, so please just share this campaign on your social media and you're bound to have some philanthropic friends that might like to pledge!  Thank you for supporting and sharing!!! I truly appreciate it!!<br/> </p>

They are ready to be recorded in Nashville! These country songs infused with pop undertones are the culmination of many experiences and insights. Each of them carries a very special meaning and message to me. There are songs about bridging distances, and relationships, songs about great memories of really good summers growing up in Houston, songs about what dreams dream about, and songs about a never-ending love that stays. For more information on my background, go to <a href=""http://www.stevenybarra.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stevenybarra.com</a>.     </p><p><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/stevenybarramusic/album-teaser-indiegogo2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here</a> for a <strong>sample acoustic teaser</strong> of a few songs for my next CD that I'll be recording in the Nashville studios. <strong>This snippet is just a hint of how this music will sound before including the top-quality musicians, professional engineers and multi-talented arrangers I’ll be using.   </strong>    </p><p><strong>A bit of background on me: </strong></p><p>On my journey of creating and performing music for many years and touring nationally, I’ve been a featured artist for Eric Church, Darius Rucker, Shania Twain, Gavin DeGraw, Carrie Underwood, and many others.

They are ready to be recorded in Nashville! These country songs infused with pop undertones are the culmination of many experiences and insights. Each of them carries a very special meaning and message to me. There are songs about bridging distances, and relationships, songs about great memories of really good summers growing up in Houston, songs about what dreams dream about, and songs about a never-ending love that stays. For more information on my background, go to www.stevenybarra.com.     Click here for a sample acoustic teaser of a few songs for my next CD that I'll be recording in the Nashville studios. This snippet is just a hint of how this music will sound before including the top-quality musicians, professional engineers and multi-talented arrangers I’ll be using.       A bit of background on me: On my journey of creating and performing music for many years and touring nationally, I’ve been a featured artist for Eric Church, Darius Rucker, Shania Twain, Gavin DeGraw, Carrie Underwood, and many others. I won the Durango Songwriter’s Expo in the Country category and my most recent CD, What I Really Want to Say, reached the top 75 on the Country iTunes chart on release day. The song ‘Stand’ from that CD made it into the Top 10 Chart for Best Country Radio. What I Really Want to Say was considered for 2 Grammy’s in the Best Country Solo Performance and Best Country Album categories.

<h3>Songs about books</h3>
<p>Help Charlie and I bring our songs about books to the West Coast!</p>
<ul>
<li>I founded Bushwick Book club in 2009 at Goodbye Blue Monday in Bushwick.  We put on regular shows featuring new music, art and snacks inspired by a chosen work of literature.  Charlie is a long time recording engineer, producer, musician and songwriter who started contributing to Bushwick Book Club in 2013.  We've formed a duo, Lusterlit, as a new context for what we've done for years-- write, record and perform our songs inspired by literature.</li>
<li>We're bringing ourselves and our songs to the west coast to connect with existing Bushwick Book Club chapters and songwriting friends and also let the literature-inspired sparks fly in BBC-virginal areas like... Portland, Oregon!</li>
<li>You're helping create the first Bushwick Book Club Tour.  We're planning for it to be the first of many as Bushwick Book Club keeps growing, and literature-inspired creativity spreads to other cities in the U.S. and beyond (hello, Malmo, Sweden!).</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our goal of $2000 is going towards the printing of physical CDs of Lusterlit's two recordings -- ""<strong>Hopeful Monsters</strong>"" and ""<strong>Everything is Sateen: Five Songs Inspired by Vonnegut</strong>"" which are right now only available online.  We're also printing bookmarks, stickers and Tshirts in addition to purchasing the flights and car rental.  Luckily we have friends with couches out there, so we're saving that way!</li>
<li>Every donation receives an invite to the fundraising brunch party sponsored by <b>BUSHWITCH</b>--Bushwick's new everyday magic service created by Julie Lamendola and Susan Hwang.</li>
<li>Other levels of donations qualify for gratitude in the shape of Lusterlit recordings, postcards from the road, custom songs, live performances and special services and gifts at the BUSHWITCH party!</li>

<p>I first fell in love with music when I was in the seventh grade in Zimbabwe, in the year 2000. Our class teacher, Mr Maposa taught all the subjects and music was one of them. I remember one day he arranged us in class according to our vocal capabilities and he went to the chalk board, thought to himself and scribbled some musical notation on it (it looked quite gibberish to me). Moments later he expressed what he had noted vocally, with a melody. I was in utter disbelief that one could do that! Sadly though, I never quite paid much attention to music after that due to the fact that I was at a new school, in a new country and learning things in a new language (English from Kiswahili which is my native tongue). I had to focus on my studies and get ready for my final exams but, I will never forget that day and I still remember the tune to the song Mr maposa wrote down. I never got the chance to learn music again, the schools I went to after did not have music programs and them being boarding schools in rural areas meant I had no access to anything music related really.</p>
<p><br/>Music was not done with me and it would come to haunt me again. I was a freshman at university in Botswana (in 2007), I remember one night we were studying until late and I wanted to take a breather because I was tired. I then asked a friend of mine Kweku if I could listen to some music on his PSP (Playstation Portable game device). There were a couple of good tunes in there, I was feeling relaxed. I then started hearing some instrumentals, after the first two I looked over at the PSP to see who the artist was. I could not believe my eyes, Kweku had made those instumentals! I got up and I asked Kweku if he really had made them, his reply was yes he did. The next day we went over to his house, he showed me his set up (which was just a PC, the software he used were FruityLoops studio and Propellerhead Reason and a pair of studio monitors). I did not not have a computer of my own at the time so, whenever I got the chance I would go over to Kweku’s house and learn how to use the software. The following year I got my own laptop and oh boy, how excited I was!! I was studying Civil Engineering at the time and again I needed to focus more on my studies so I did music when I got the chance. My parents were working very hard to put me and my siblings through school and it would be unfair if I were to neglect the opportunity given.<br/>I graduated in 2013, that same year we relocated back home in Tanzania. I had taken a break from doing music, I wanted to get a job experience. In 2014 I then decided that I will take music more serious, I then decided to save up some money and move back to Southern Africa (I was targeting South Africa mostly but I ended up settling in Botswana in January 2015). It was a very demanding, low pay position but it got me to put food on the table. </p>
<p><br/>I lost my job in February of this year (2017). It was a bittersweet moment for me, I was glad that the emotional and physical demands of the past 2 years are finally over but then again how was I going to survive? I took comfort in that, maybe I could use this time to work on my long dream of making music. I then started watching tutorials on how to get better at it. It has not been all that great, times have changed and music has evolved. I am still using an old software (Propellerhead Reason 5 from 2010) which is still okay but to keep up with the times and for me to express my full creativity I would need the latest version of the software on the market which is Propellerhead Reason 9. I would also need a more powerful laptop to efficiently run the software and other devices. My current laptop can hardly handle the software that I am using, hence most times I find myself not being able to make music of great quality. I would also be needing a midi keyboard and a pair of studio monitors so I can correctly arrange the sounds. <br/>This was a long post (I apologise for taking too much of your time). I would very much appreciate if you were kind enough to help me in any way to realize my long dream of making music full time. I could and would have saved up for this but I have also been helping my folks back home, resettling has not been easy but they’re okay . We have not met but I love you, for taking the time and for supporting me. Asante sana.</p>

It was a bittersweet moment for me, I was glad that the emotional and physical demands of the past 2 years are finally over but then again how was I going to survive? I took comfort in that, maybe I could use this time to work on my long dream of making music. I then started watching tutorials on how to get better at it. It has not been all that great, times have changed and music has evolved. I am still using an old software (Propellerhead Reason 5 from 2010) which is still okay but to keep up with the times and for me to express my full creativity I would need the latest version of the software on the market which is Propellerhead Reason 9. I would also need a more powerful laptop to efficiently run the software and other devices. My current laptop can hardly handle the software that I am using, hence most times I find myself not being able to make music of great quality. I would also be needing a midi keyboard and a pair of studio monitors so I can correctly arrange the sounds. This was a long post (I apologise for taking too much of your time). I would very much appreciate if you were kind enough to help me in any way to realize my long dream of making music full time. I could and would have saved up for this but I have also been helping my folks back home, resettling has not been easy but they’re okay . We have not met but I love you, for taking the time and for supporting me. Asante sana.

<li><p>Here's the thing: I don't love the music business at ALL. I just love the music. It really is a broken model based on human suffering and outright theft. You've all heard the stories on ""Behind the Music"" and the Vampiric nature of the industry. We all know the empty suits just squeeze an orange &amp; then pat themselves on the back, claiming to discover orange juice. </p></li>
<li><p>I had some success in my career, but long lasting financial success eluded me because I'm a bit of a headstrong rebel and they don't appreciate that much. If you do what you're told, they will help you, if you don't, you're on your own. But that's actually a blessing to tell you the truth. That's why I'm totally independent these days. And, no matter what the offer, I will always STAY independent. I don't want any ""handler"" telling me what to do, nor should ANY artist worth their salt. We know people aren't buying CDs anymore &amp; it's harder than ever to make a living as a musician. I could use your help.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to speak from the heart with a rapid fire lyrical fearlessness. I also want to experiment with my voice as the only instrument on this record. I can cut &amp; paste &amp; take chances, use tons of syncopation &amp; asymmetrical beats to create something that is fun &amp; interesting. Stripped down production wise, but layered with interesting vocal tracks and spooky noises &amp; whatever I come up with along the way. Organic, but not at all novelty. No cover songs, only brand new, original songs. I just want to speak my truth.</p></li>
<li><p>It seems like comedians are being censored. Thought crime &amp; political correctness have suddenly become really overbearing, and many musicians are content to make music that is pure escapism instead of intellectually honest songwriting. They do that because ""fun"" is safer and escapism is avoidance. There's nothing wrong with fun music, but it seems like that's 99% of what's out there these days. It's good to take shots at the system, because let's face it, the system is pretty damn evil.</p></li>
<li><p>It's turbulent out there in the social sphere too. That's why freedom of speech seems more important than ever. I also think music has a large role in pointing out the absurdities of the control system. ""Normal"" is actually pretty insane if you really take an honest look at it; the inmates run the asylum. But most people are content to write songs about being in the club and how big that chick's booty is, and about how important they are because of their thick, gold chain, custom made with their name written in diamonds. rampant materialism &amp; base consciousness doesn't HAVE to be the new normal for Hip Hop though.</p></li>
<li><p>There's been plenty of incredible music over the years that brought the truth regardless of consequence. Deep shit is not marketable these days. But so what! That doesn't mean it's not important. In fact, maybe it's more important than ever to write challenging lyrics. Who said doing what's right leads to popularity? Popularity is just peer pressure anyway. </p></li>
<li><p>Privacy doesn't even exist anymore. We have apparently just accepted that government spying is the new normal. There will be a few shots across the bow on this record. Here's a line from one of the new songs: ""All you agents in the NSA, I got one finger with a lot to say.""</p></li>
<li><p>I accidentally wrote ""Fly Free"" while experimenting in the studio. But it was a happy accident for sure. The process was inspiring and it went down easy, so now I want to write &amp; record 9 more songs in that same vain.

<li><p>I just believe there's more to say out there, and I think I have an interesting way to deliver it. In an age where zombies run around taking selfies on railroad tracks, as they collect Pokemon while driving, &amp; girls get ALL dressed up just to stare at their cell phones and text their friends sitting right next to them, I think we can do better. What happened to songs like ""What's Goin' On"" &amp; ""Peace Train"" or ""Another Brick In The Wall"" that made you think?</p></li>
<li><p>Another line from a new song: ""Gather courage, not Pokemon, go see the world you're standing on."" We are in a culture that values Human 2.0, the cyborg. But I think the original model is classic. I prefer analogue. These days, man is merging with machine but to what end? Is our life really better now that we have 8 different social media accounts? It's stresses me the fuck out to be honest. But our true humanity is in our empathy, our emotions, our passion, our hearts. Everybody wants to be Spock; I'd rather be Kirk. Engage number one! Just light a match if you engage number two. Insert poop emoji here.</p></li>
<li><p>I appreciate your help very much. Thank you for being a patron of the arts &amp; for encouraging truth &amp; freedom of expression. We are not just the collective, the hive mind, the Borg. We are people that need each other, yes. But we must retain and encourage individuality. Otherwise, what is art for? Is it just for money and image and PR agents? Is it just for social media hit counts and the cult of personality? Is it just to be famous and be on TV? I think we should make art for the same reason they did thousands of years ago, to express ourselves and say something real. Sometimes people just have to step up and say things that need to be said. I know that's what I want to do with this record. </p></li>
<li><p>I just want to buy groceries, have the right gear, and go all mad scientist in the studio like Brian Wilson did. I seriously can't WAIT to get started. I'm super excited to be honest.

My family, friends, my supporters &lt;3 You brought the real Katarzyna back, filled with love and passion, ready to sing my heart out, give joy and inspire the world. THANK YOU! Hope you'll read until the end and CONTRIBUTE :)<br/><br/>My VISION</strong></p><ul>
<li>To discover a path of a successful musical theatre/film actress, to be the best I can in my career and impact life of those in need, not only an actress but a humanitarian as well. </li>
<li>To be a role model and a mentor for young people to inspire and guide them in following their passion and making their dreams come true. <strong>Why</strong> - I never had that type of professional support myself.</li>
<li>To found an academy/institution different than all the currents ones. Here, both children with special needs and healthy children/ youngsters come together to explore their passion and grow especially through arts, become exceptional, giving them not only a talent development but also business skills to make money from their passion already while they study - long term goal<br/><br/>*my story will help you understand my vision :) you can read it below*</li>
</ul><p><strong>My STORY</strong></p><p>I was born and raised on the south-west of Poland in a home where spending time with each other, having meals together, gardening, helping was just living. My parents; dad, a plumber and mum, a retired-teacher, taught me compassion, warmheartedness, giving without expecting anything in return. Mum once said; ""have tears for yourself and smile for the world"". This rang true to me even to this day.</p><p>Since childhood, I felt it clearly that I had the ability to be who I want to be, that everything is possible, that we all have special gift to the world. But I didn't realise that so many people have not yet discovered theirs.</p><p>After exploring the world through travelling I may say, regardless the fact that my parents struggled to make ends meet, I am so grateful for the childhood I was given. I never wanted to give my parents additional worries. My wish was to always put a smile on their face, so I always did my best to get top grades at school, strove to be better and better at everything that I did, giving my all. I was able to stay among one of the top students in class. I attended all the extra classes and worked hard. This  probably might be the reason why I wasn't liked by other students. I learned to find joy in spending time on my own by singing, I could pour out all what hurt me.</p><p>Just by being one of the top students through the school years, I was always being bullied. I never had the courage to speak to anyone about this, or to stand for myself, but life is the best teacher. Now that I am older, I can see the bigger picture. I just didn't fit in. I was the weird one, what interested my friends didn't interest me at all. I liked older schoolmates or adults more, as they helped me to grow. I love the growth.</p><p>Nevertheless, ever since I was bullied I kept shutting down more and more, even though deep down, I knew that I had a lot to give to others and to the world, but I was not able to express my true self. Whenever I was offering help, I would be mocked, left alone until they needed me again. I was being taken for granted.</p><p>I remember telling my mum one time about my vision, that I saw myself in front of a giant audience, empowering them to be who they want to be using my voice and bringing them joy! Not knowing how mum would react, she said, “if that's what you feel, go for it"". I was so happy to hear that. Mum has always been my most loyal supporter. I truly believe that money isn't everything, but love is.</p><p>More challenges arises when others’ voices kept telling me, “you should stop with all this music idea and focus on being a doctor or a lawyer with my brains, a serious profession, not being a dreamer”, but what about my heart? It was thanks to mum that I am able to be so strong today. She cared about my heart so much, if it wasn't for her I probably would have given up by now. My dreams would have died with me from all the bullying that I had went through. Even as I am writing this, my eyes are getting teary.  Adam Mickiewicz, a famous Polish poet and dramatist once wrote, ""true love does not end, ever, the more you give, the more you receive"".<br/><br/>Since then, I took the exam to do my secondary music school in vocal performance and started to study opera. After graduation, I got accepted into Music Academy. I did this collaterally with my English College. This time, I had a rough 5-6 years with another singing teacher I chose as I've heard students saying that this teacher is tough but if you survive you sing. Regardless all of the ""painful"" moments I am grateful to her, yes I am, because by loudly doubting in my voice she challenged me and the more she mocked my ability of becoming, the more I grew in strength. She saw the real me and the gift that I had. As challenging as she was, she also helped me discover how much I love musical theater.  I remember then coming across an actress who was not only a musical theater but also a film actress, her name was Kristin Chenoweth. She became one of my career-inspirations for the future, musical theater and film. I’ve always wished for someone like her as a mentor.</p><p>After being told constantly that I will never make it in this industry, I kind of lost hope. Just a part of me inside still wanted to keep going. I went on an inner-journey to rediscover my voice and my true self. Time alone was what I needed the most. I prayed for a mentor, like a father who could be there for me and guide me.</p><p>Shortly after, as if God have heard my prayers, after hearing me pour my heart into the song “Papa can you hear me"", a mentor has found me and ever since then continuously supports me and believes in me. I have a lot to thank him for.</p><p>Ever since then, as if by magic, other people started to approach me, telling me how my singing have inspired them and have given them back something they once lost. The more I gave, the more I would receive back. All the new friendships I was given, this unexpected exposure and belief, they truly believe in me. Of course there are also those who don't believe, who still mock, but as I remember my friend Trent Shelton in his speech said once ""Haters, are the confused supporters, give them time"", I really love this sentence.</p><p>During my travel exploring the world, I had conversations with actors and actresses as well as my international peers on the way of becoming...  Because London and New York are said to be the musical theatre cradle I knew I want to learn the craft in one or the other one. Big Apple though, was more cheerful, giggly, more like me :) I wished to study there, but had no idea how and where. I was in London at that time when I saw New York Film Academy holding auditions. I couldn't believe, in 2010 at the dance camp I heard my friend being so excited about this school. I had a little dream deep in my heart since then. Everything has its right timing, I believe. I went there, listened about the program, very intensive, very condense and conservatory that means more practice than theory. In two years time I would learn so much. I felt extremely excited, but I didn't have the money so I auditioned for the short intensive 4 -week program. I got accepted, I read the acceptance email like a hundred times, before I actually believed! I earned for this course myself. When I went there... every day felt like I'm in the right place doing what I am supposed to be doing. Every day, all the classes we had, the support and encouragement, every subject what it was about, the deeper meaning of life, the natural truths, pouring your feelings through songs, this felt like home to my heart.</p><p>At the end of this course we could audition for a whole 2-years program. I took this chance, not having money, now or never. I was blown away when I found out that not only did I get accepted, but I was granted the highest talent-based scholarship available!</p><p>Now I promised myself, with YOUR support, I will do whatever GOOD it takes to continue in the direction of my heart!<br/><br/>I thank the Lord for all the challenging people that had taught me lessons and my supporters entering my life. Even with this campaign now, I couldn’t have made it happen alone without the help and support of my mum, my family, Mr Roger Del Pozo, Mr Joey Zangardi-Dixon, thanks for the amazing video &amp; photos Abel Lawson, Denny Silva, Krzysztof Buratyński, Marek Walczyk, my amazing UK friends (Indiegogo team) Ich Loc, Jonathan Poon, Marium Zulfigar, Luke Scott, and all my offline and online friends-supporters. I truly love and appreciate every one of you.

My family, friends, my supporters <3 You brought the real Katarzyna back, filled with love and passion, ready to sing my heart out, give joy and inspire the world. THANK YOU! Hope you'll read until the end and CONTRIBUTE :)My VISION
To discover a path of a successful musical theatre/film actress, to be the best I can in my career and impact life of those in need, not only an actress but a humanitarian as well. 
To be a role model and a mentor for young people to inspire and guide them in following their passion and making their dreams come true. Why - I never had that type of professional support myself.
To found an academy/institution different than all the currents ones. Here, both children with special needs and healthy children/ youngsters come together to explore their passion and grow especially through arts, become exceptional, giving them not only a talent development but also business skills to make money from their passion already while they study - long term goal*my story will help you understand my vision :) you can read it below*
My STORYI was born and raised on the south-west of Poland in a home where spending time with each other, having meals together, gardening, helping was just living. My parents; dad, a plumber and mum, a retired-teacher, taught me compassion, warmheartedness, giving without expecting anything in return. Mum once said; ""have tears for yourself and smile for the world"". This rang true to me even to this day.Since childhood, I felt it clearly that I had the ability to be who I want to be, that everything is possible, that we all have special gift to the world. But I didn't realise that so many people have not yet discovered theirs.After exploring the world through travelling I may say, regardless the fact that my parents struggled to make ends meet, I am so grateful for the childhood I was given. I never wanted to give my parents additional worries. My wish was to always put a smile on their face, so I always did my best to get top grades at school, strove to be better and better at everything that I did, giving my all. I was able to stay among one of the top students in class. I attended all the extra classes and worked hard. This  probably might be the reason why I wasn't liked by other students. I learned to find joy in spending time on my own by singing, I could pour out all what hurt me.Just by being one of the top students through the school years, I was always being bullied. I never had the courage to speak to anyone about this, or to stand for myself, but life is the best teacher. Now that I am older, I can see the bigger picture. I just didn't fit in. I was the weird one, what interested my friends didn't interest me at all. I liked older schoolmates or adults more, as they helped me to grow. I love the growth.Nevertheless, ever since I was bullied I kept shutting down more and more, even though deep down, I knew that I had a lot to give to others and to the world, but I was not able to express my true self. Whenever I was offering help, I would be mocked, left alone until they needed me again. I was being taken for granted.I remember telling my mum one time about my vision, that I saw myself in front of a giant audience, empowering them to be who they want to be using my voice and bringing them joy! Not knowing how mum would react, she said, “if that's what you feel, go for it"". I was so happy to hear that. Mum has always been my most loyal supporter. I truly believe that money isn't everything, but love is.More challenges arises when others’ voices kept telling me, “you should stop with all this music idea and focus on being a doctor or a lawyer with my brains, a serious profession, not being a dreamer”, but what about my heart? It was thanks to mum that I am able to be so strong today. She cared about my heart so much, if it wasn't for her I probably would have given up by now. My dreams would have died with me from all the bullying that I had went through. Even as I am writing this, my eyes are getting teary.  Adam Mickiewicz, a famous Polish poet and dramatist once wrote, ""true love does not end, ever, the more you give, the more you receive"".Since then, I took the exam to do my secondary music school in vocal performance and started to study opera. After graduation, I got accepted into Music Academy. I did this collaterally with my English College. This time, I had a rough 5-6 years with another singing teacher I chose as I've heard students saying that this teacher is tough but if you survive you sing. Regardless all of the ""painful"" moments I am grateful to her, yes I am, because by loudly doubting in my voice she challenged me and the more she mocked my ability of becoming, the more I grew in strength. She saw the real me and the gift that I had. As challenging as she was, she also helped me discover how much I love musical theater.  I remember then coming across an actress who was not only a musical theater but also a film actress, her name was Kristin Chenoweth. She became one of my career-inspirations for the future, musical theater and film. I’ve always wished for someone like her as a mentor.After being told constantly that I will never make it in this industry, I kind of lost hope. Just a part of me inside still wanted to keep going. I went on an inner-journey to rediscover my voice and my true self. Time alone was what I needed the most. I prayed for a mentor, like a father who could be there for me and guide me.Shortly after, as if God have heard my prayers, after hearing me pour my heart into the song “Papa can you hear me"", a mentor has found me and ever since then continuously supports me and believes in me. I have a lot to thank him for.Ever since then, as if by magic, other people started to approach me, telling me how my singing have inspired them and have given them back something they once lost. The more I gave, the more I would receive back. All the new friendships I was given, this unexpected exposure and belief, they truly believe in me. Of course there are also those who don't believe, who still mock, but as I remember my friend Trent Shelton in his speech said once ""Haters, are the confused supporters, give them time"", I really love this sentence.During my travel exploring the world, I had conversations with actors and actresses as well as my international peers on the way of becoming...  Because London and New York are said to be the musical theatre cradle I knew I want to learn the craft in one or the other one. Big Apple though, was more cheerful, giggly, more like me :) I wished to study there, but had no idea how and where. I was in London at that time when I saw New York Film Academy holding auditions. I couldn't believe, in 2010 at the dance camp I heard my friend being so excited about this school. I had a little dream deep in my heart since then. Everything has its right timing, I believe. I went there, listened about the program, very intensive, very condense and conservatory that means more practice than theory. In two years time I would learn so much. I felt extremely excited, but I didn't have the money so I auditioned for the short intensive 4 -week program. I got accepted, I read the acceptance email like a hundred times, before I actually believed! I earned for this course myself. When I went there... every day felt like I'm in the right place doing what I am supposed to be doing. Every day, all the classes we had, the support and encouragement, every subject what it was about, the deeper meaning of life, the natural truths, pouring your feelings through songs, this felt like home to my heart.At the end of this course we could audition for a whole 2-years program. I took this chance, not having money, now or never. I was blown away when I found out that not only did I get accepted, but I was granted the highest talent-based scholarship available!Now I promised myself, with YOUR support, I will do whatever GOOD it takes to continue in the direction of my heart!I thank the Lord for all the challenging people that had taught me lessons and my supporters entering my life. Even with this campaign now, I couldn’t have made it happen alone without the help and support of my mum, my family, Mr Roger Del Pozo, Mr Joey Zangardi-Dixon, thanks for the amazing video & photos Abel Lawson, Denny Silva, Krzysztof Buratyński, Marek Walczyk, my amazing UK friends (Indiegogo team) Ich Loc, Jonathan Poon, Marium Zulfigar, Luke Scott, and all my offline and online friends-supporters. I truly love and appreciate every one of you. It means a world to me, just to hear words such as ""keep up the good work"", ""keep moving forward"", ""well done"" and more.I am who I am today because of you all. You brought the real Katarzyna back, filled with love and passion, ready to sing my heart out, give joy and inspire the world.

<p>Often times people have tried to tell me I should stick to one style of rap, but my favorite artists were able to do different types of records and do them all well, so I've made it a point to trust my vision and put out both entertaining music and records with substance.

MUSIC</strong></i> - We have some of the music already recorded for the project and it already sounds incredible! If you've heard my single ""Put It In Reverse"" featuring E-40 (first video on this page), you can see that the quality is industry standard and can hold it's own against the top songs in the game. </p><p>We need to get this new project to the same level of quality, which would include costs for studio time to record the remaining songs, musicians, producers, other artists, mixing, and mastering.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479789631/dutmhc8t4jzhgudpi2ih.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><i><strong>2. PROMOTION</strong></i> - This is such a crucial step. When it comes to marketing, I like to use the classic question: </p><p><i>If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound?</i></p><p>The same goes for music (or any product really). I want to get the word out heavy about this project. I've put my blood, sweat, and tears into the project and believe it will speak to a lot of people, so I want to do it justice by making sure we get it in front of as many eyes and ears as humanly (and financially) possible.</p><p>The cost of promotion can take many forms, including social media, magazines / blogs, physical promotional products (ex: flyers), events (ex: release party, pop up shop), and radio promotion. </p><p><strong><i>Radio Promotion</i></strong> -  Radio is it's own beast. We did a radio run for my single ""Put It In Reverse"" featuring E-40, getting it in rotation on over 20 stations and it has gotten great feedback. There are inherent costs with radio promo that can get expensive, like traveling to multiple cities across the country to go into various stations, do interviews, and provide promotional materials like CDs, shirts, and flyers. </p><p>What's crazy is I've competed with artists who have major record companies backing them (like Beyonce) for the same airtime, as there is only so much airtime available in a day.  What's even crazier is that we were able to get into rotation, which is rare for an independent artist, but it speaks to the music we're creating and let's me know that we just need to keep the machine going. With more funding, I believe we can make an even stronger impact at radio.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/t4mvC2Apjp8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><div><p><i><strong>3. MUSIC VIDEOS</strong></i> - Music videos are also crucial, and can get expensive depending on what you're trying to do. The more money we raise, the better our videos will be.  I've always been a fan of incorporating a story into music videos and having it be more than just me rapping in front of the camera (see my <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsViA9db9Ik"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HyePower</a> video).</p></div><div><p>With your help the visuals for this project can come to life and be fire.</p></div><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479694902/kcjzysflmn8kak0aveav.jpg"" src=""""/></div><div> </div><div>

<p><strong>One of them is the MIGHTY HYE Lion Black T-Shirt below.</strong> My last name ""Aslanian"" actually translates to ""Lion"" so that's how we came up with the logo, and it basically means believe in yourself and be proud of who you are.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Although there are risks in any business, there are also keys to success common in any business: having a good team, being driven &amp; resourceful, planning &amp; being organized, and knowing your audience &amp; market. We have all of those elements in place.</p>
<p>On top of that, you need a great product. Fortunately, the feedback we've gotten on my current single ""Put It In Reverse"" has been so great, from DJs &amp; radio to fans, that we know that we're onto something. Just check out my Twitter feed as an example of how many people are liking and sharing the song organically. These are real people, real fans, who genuinely like the music and have shared it on their own accord.</p>
<p>Also over time, by risking my own funds, I've been able to learn from the past, build my network, and also assemble a great team of people specializing in a wide range of areas crucial to success like marketing, publicity, music production, radio promotion, social media marketing, audio engineering, songwriting, video production, graphic design, web design, and more.</p>
<p>All of these factors gives us confidence in launching a successful project. The only concern at this point is the funding, so I want to close with this:</p>
<p>I APPRECIATE YOU. JOIN ME IN THIS JOURNEY AND LET'S TAKE IT TO THE MOON.</p>
<p>AYO!</p>

I've put my blood, sweat, and tears into the project and believe it will speak to a lot of people, so I want to do it justice by making sure we get it in front of as many eyes and ears as humanly (and financially) possible.The cost of promotion can take many forms, including social media, magazines / blogs, physical promotional products (ex: flyers), events (ex: release party, pop up shop), and radio promotion. Radio Promotion -  Radio is it's own beast. We did a radio run for my single ""Put It In Reverse"" featuring E-40, getting it in rotation on over 20 stations and it has gotten great feedback. There are inherent costs with radio promo that can get expensive, like traveling to multiple cities across the country to go into various stations, do interviews, and provide promotional materials like CDs, shirts, and flyers. What's crazy is I've competed with artists who have major record companies backing them (like Beyonce) for the same airtime, as there is only so much airtime available in a day.  What's even crazier is that we were able to get into rotation, which is rare for an independent artist, but it speaks to the music we're creating and let's me know that we just need to keep the machine going. With more funding, I believe we can make an even stronger impact at radio. 3. MUSIC VIDEOS - Music videos are also crucial, and can get expensive depending on what you're trying to do. The more money we raise, the better our videos will be.  I've always been a fan of incorporating a story into music videos and having it be more than just me rapping in front of the camera (see my HyePower video).With your help the visuals for this project can come to life and be fire. 
We've put together a wide range of rewards, so take a look on the right for the options!
One of them is the MIGHTY HYE Lion Black T-Shirt below. My last name ""Aslanian"" actually translates to ""Lion"" so that's how we came up with the logo, and it basically means believe in yourself and be proud of who you are.
  
This Kickstarter is the only place to pre-order my new project, and you'll get it TWO WEEKS before the general public does.
============================================================
The rewards get better as the tiers go up, and I wanted to have fun with this process because I appreciate you so much and I truly love what I do.

========================================================================================================================
Risks and challenges
Although there are risks in any business, there are also keys to success common in any business: having a good team, being driven & resourceful, planning & being organized, and knowing your audience & market. We have all of those elements in place.
On top of that, you need a great product. Fortunately, the feedback we've gotten on my current single ""Put It In Reverse"" has been so great, from DJs & radio to fans, that we know that we're onto something. Just check out my Twitter feed as an example of how many people are liking and sharing the song organically. These are real people, real fans, who genuinely like the music and have shared it on their own accord.
Also over time, by risking my own funds, I've been able to learn from the past, build my network, and also assemble a great team of people specializing in a wide range of areas crucial to success like marketing, publicity, music production, radio promotion, social media marketing, audio engineering, songwriting, video production, graphic design, web design, and more.
All of these factors gives us confidence in launching a successful project. The only concern at this point is the funding, so I want to close with this:
I APPRECIATE YOU. JOIN ME IN THIS JOURNEY AND LET'S TAKE IT TO THE MOON.

<p>""I met Pascal Fouquet in 2010 at Le Caveau de la Huchette, a swing dance &amp; live music club in Paris, France. After a serendipitous French Comedy of Errors, we began our life and music together. We've toured festivals and venues from India to Buddy Guy's Legends in Chicago. We recorded our first CD in our apartment in Bernay, France, with Pascal sitting on the toilet with his guitar and me singing in the closet. Now, we're finally ready to step into a real Chicago Blues studio! We've put together a team of international award winning artists and can't wait to get the boogie flowing!"" Deep breath and exhale ...  ""BUT... stepping up to this level has big expenses: studio, producer, mix &amp; mastering, talent, design, pressing, promotion, airfare, and accommodations. I'm far from rich and could use some grassroots help. I'm putting everything I've saved and will make this year into this gift for my Prime Rooster. If you'd like to be a partner on this journey here's how you can help ..."" Lil' Red</p>

<p><strong>JENNIFER ""LIL' RED"" MILLIGAN * VOCALS * WASHBOARD</strong></p>
<p><i>“ … diva voice that walks voluptuously from Bessie Smith to Janis Joplin crossing without a hitch tonalities and eras always sounding the most sincere and accurate possible.” Fred Delforge, Zic-a-Zic</i></p>
<p>A veteran of the stage, from Westerville, Ohio, this multi-talented singer/songwriter has touched the hearts of hundreds of thousands internationally on stage, screen and recording. Her magnetic presence, exuberant energy and genuine smile bring a warm authentic charm to the blues scene. With her bed as a stage and hairbrush for microphone, she started singing at the age of 6 accompanied by her motherʼs 45s on her Mickey Mouse turntable. By the age of 11 her bed was replaced by a stage and by 22 she was touring the country as the lead in the National tour of Hair. In her professional career she has performed in and or choreographed more productions than years she has lived. With every note she wishes to thank Ella, Etta, &amp; Dinah with every word Shakespeare &amp; Tom Waits and with every rhythm T-Bone &amp; Luigi.</p>

<p><i>“… the exceptionally graceful and virtuoso guitar of Pascal Fouquet takes you into a fourth<br/>dimension… ” Fred Delforge, Zicazic</i></p>
<p>This blues man got his start playing classical guitar at the age of 11 on a farm in Normandy, France. Five years later when BB Kingʼs “Blues Is King” reached his ears, his focus changed to Blues, from there he became one of the most admired Blues guitarists in France. This extraordinary soloist integrates the Blues of the 40’s &amp; 50’s with contemporary blues to create his own unique sound and style. In his 40+ year career, he has won several awards for best soloist. He’s shared the stage with many recognized Blues artists including Diunna Greenleaf, Sax Gordon, Sean Costello, Alex Schultz, Kid Ramos, Jimmy Morello, Andy J. Forest, Michael “Hawkeye” Herman, Rob Rio, Kenny “Blues Boss” Wayne, Candye Kane, Fernando Jones, Ricky Nye, Sean Carney, Steve Clayton, Drew Davies and Shaun Booker. He tours regularly with Lil’ Red &amp; The Rooster, Mike Sanchez &amp; Steve Clayton. He remains ever true to his favorite guitar masters, T-Bone Walker, Tiny Grimes, &amp; Charlie Christian.</p>

Contagious charm .... serious blues.
""I met Pascal Fouquet in 2010 at Le Caveau de la Huchette, a swing dance & live music club in Paris, France. After a serendipitous French Comedy of Errors, we began our life and music together. We've toured festivals and venues from India to Buddy Guy's Legends in Chicago. We recorded our first CD in our apartment in Bernay, France, with Pascal sitting on the toilet with his guitar and me singing in the closet. Now, we're finally ready to step into a real Chicago Blues studio! We've put together a team of international award winning artists and can't wait to get the boogie flowing!"" Deep breath and exhale ...  ""BUT... stepping up to this level has big expenses: studio, producer, mix & mastering, talent, design, pressing, promotion, airfare, and accommodations. I'm far from rich and could use some grassroots help. I'm putting everything I've saved and will make this year into this gift for my Prime Rooster. If you'd like to be a partner on this journey here's how you can help ..."" Lil' Red

OUR MUSIC
blues ... boogie ... jump ... rag ... funk ... R&B ... Texas ... New Orleans ... Delta ... Chicago ...
""Touching and refreshing with a bit of humor, their originals bring back the old blues and rhythm and blues.""
We love blues and rhythm & blues music of 1920's through the early 60's. The swing rhythms and layered lyrics feel good as they walk a balance between emotion and musical wit. Our originals are inspired from this rich era of music, that we're bringing forward with text relevant to contemporary life.
""They’re warm and inviting and their music is inspired and innovative. Blues with a spirit full of hope and joy may inspire you to get up and boogie!""

BLAISE BARTON * ENGINEER * MIX & MASTERING

His work preserves a natural sound needed in Blues while still being radio playable. If you know anything about recording, this ability comes from years of experience listening. Most importantly, he's a real nice guy and his studio feels homey.

JENNIFER ""LIL' RED"" MILLIGAN * VOCALS * WASHBOARD
“ … diva voice that walks voluptuously from Bessie Smith to Janis Joplin crossing without a hitch tonalities and eras always sounding the most sincere and accurate possible.” Fred Delforge, Zic-a-Zic
A veteran of the stage, from Westerville, Ohio, this multi-talented singer/songwriter has touched the hearts of hundreds of thousands internationally on stage, screen and recording. Her magnetic presence, exuberant energy and genuine smile bring a warm authentic charm to the blues scene. With her bed as a stage and hairbrush for microphone, she started singing at the age of 6 accompanied by her motherʼs 45s on her Mickey Mouse turntable. By the age of 11 her bed was replaced by a stage and by 22 she was touring the country as the lead in the National tour of Hair. In her professional career she has performed in and or choreographed more productions than years she has lived. With every note she wishes to thank Ella, Etta, & Dinah with every word Shakespeare & Tom Waits and with every rhythm T-Bone & Luigi.
“… before Jennifer Milligan can finish her entrance onto the stage, the audience immediately falls under the spell of this extremely charismatic singer!”Alain Hoit, Zic-a-Zic Magazine

PASCAL ""THE ROOSTER"" FOUQUET * GUITAR * BARITONE GUITAR
“… the exceptionally graceful and virtuoso guitar of Pascal Fouquet takes you into a fourthdimension… ” Fred Delforge, Zicazic
This blues man got his start playing classical guitar at the age of 11 on a farm in Normandy, France. Five years later when BB Kingʼs “Blues Is King” reached his ears, his focus changed to Blues, from there he became one of the most admired Blues guitarists in France. This extraordinary soloist integrates the Blues of the 40’s & 50’s with contemporary blues to create his own unique sound and style. In his 40+ year career, he has won several awards for best soloist. He’s shared the stage with many recognized Blues artists including Diunna Greenleaf, Sax Gordon, Sean Costello, Alex Schultz, Kid Ramos, Jimmy Morello, Andy J. Forest, Michael “Hawkeye” Herman, Rob Rio, Kenny “Blues Boss” Wayne, Candye Kane, Fernando Jones, Ricky Nye, Sean Carney, Steve Clayton, Drew Davies and Shaun Booker. He tours regularly with Lil’ Red & The Rooster, Mike Sanchez & Steve Clayton. He remains ever true to his favorite guitar masters, T-Bone Walker, Tiny Grimes, & Charlie Christian.

<p>Pop music has never been in such a precarious place since the inception of the form. Pete Townshend once stated that ""pop music is art, and it should remain art"" - and this is an ethic Kurt Riley has held close to his heart.

This has led to a discernible decline in the quality and the diversity of pop music. Kurt Riley has only one goal in mind - to play a part in returning music to the heights seen during the halcyon days of the 20th Century. Music was <i>incredible</i> once - why can't it be again?</p>

</div></div>","Who is Kurt Riley?
Kurt Riley is an independent pop musician, songwriter, and performer. Influenced by legends including Bo Diddley, The Killers, Queen, T.Rex, and The Rolling Stones, Riley writes and performs his own material, in stark contrast to the manufactured pop music saturating our world today. He has been composing and performing for 15 years, always with one goal in mind - to make music as timeless and satisfying as the classic songs he grew up with.
His first studio album, Brighthead, was recorded with Beyoncé producer BOOTS. Subsequently, his sci-fi concept album Kismet was released to great acclaim by radio stations, blogs, and newspapers in New York, where he resides. The Cornell Daily Sun called Kismet  ""an intergalactic fantasia...(gazing) both at the history of rock ‘n’ roll and at a dream of a more moral existence...optimistic about the potential of compassion and, most of all, about the future of music itself.""Following an epic live performance of Kismet at Cornell University, Kurt Riley was named one of the top regional live acts of 2016 by The Ithaca Journal. In January 2017, Riley was awarded a cash grant from the Community Arts Partnership of Tompkins County, New York, to help pay for the recording of Tabula Rasa.Tabula Rasa is a collection of 10 incredible songs, in diverse styles. From pop balladry to blazing rock and roll and deeply personal numbers, it will show a breadth and a depth from Kurt Riley that has not been witnessed before. The album is slated to be released in Spring 2017.

<h2>What's Up?</h2>
<p>As an Outlaw Country/Americana duo we are dedicated to creating a true representation of traditional country music infused with harrowing rock. We recently relocated to Nashville, TN from Los Angeles, CA and we have never been more excited to take Crimson Calamity to the next level. This new EP will be the next chapter and we want you to be a part of it. We know that we can make this campaign a huge success with your collaboration and as a thank you for your generosity we have curated some awesome perks to say thank you! Check out the campaign details below:</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What YOU Get</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>Makin' music the ole fashioned way ain't cheap!</p>
<p>As independent musicians, the cost of making and releasing a quality record can seem insurmountable without the support of a record label. There are many aspects that go into the record making process such as: Studio time, rehearsals, musicians, an engineer, a producer, mixing, mastering and more. To create the EP it will cost us $10K which is what we set our goal at. However, to manufacture and ensure that this little baby gets a proper birthday we must raise an additional $10K for distribution, marketing, promotion and a music video. That's $20K total! We told ya it ain't cheap! We will be over the moon to meet and surpass our goal with your help.</p>
<p>That's why we carefully curated some really fun perks and rewards to show our gratitude for your support. Everyone who donates will receive a digital copy of our record one week before it's released to the world! We have VIP tickets, Skype sessions, original songs, drawings, house concerts and more!</p>
</div><h2><strong>Sharing Is Caring!</strong></h2><div>
<p>Unable to financially contribute at this time but want to know how you can help? Sharing with friends and family via social media can be just as valuable! For those who contribute by sharing we even have some drawings planned for a chance to win some Crimson Calamity merch!</p>

<h3>The Concept</h3>
<p>My name is Adan Robledo. I'm a 21 year old musician from Tucson, Arizona and my purpose is to bring people together with music. Currently, I'm working on an instrumental album that I started writing roughly a year ago in an attempt to cope with the many hardships life had presented to me. This album is called 'The Human Experience' and tells the story of my journey so far. Each song is being written to have it's own theme, musical style, and 'feel'. I aim to create a song for everyone on this album. Some songs will be a disgustingly heavy, and some will be happy while others pull influence from jazz and classical styles. The point is diversity. I want as many people as possible to be able to come together and speak the universal language of music.</p>

(smile)</div><div> </div><div> I am so grateful that I have connected to my purpose...but, truth be told, doing so much by my lonesome can create sentiments of suffering because it sometimes feels like so many people do not care.  And, to simply say a word about Rasé's efforts that gives something so dynamite and so Vital to our collective experience, is asking too much.  So, the indifference towards something that is not superficial, to something that we healing artists pour our Souls into everyday, I am unafraid to say, can be quite harsh. </div><div> </div><div>So, I am asking you to please share one of my hats with me: contribute any amount you can to the Cipher, spread the world on your social media platforms, purchase a cipher keepsake at leapintoyourwings.com, invite Rasé to your next event.  Experience Us!  </div><div> </div><h3>A Funny Hat Story</h3><div>I'd never considered myself to be someone who can draw.  But I had to delve into this craft because I could not afford to commission an artist/graphic designer to design the images for my T-shirt ideas.  <i><strong>But, Eureka!  I can draw?  I can draw! </strong></i> And, after endless YouTube videos, articles, and days of barely sleeping, I am now proficient in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop!  But, my!  Has the process been time consuming!  Truthfully speaking, I am not superwoman (wink).  And I strive to honor the morals of the Cipher which is to live a balanced life wherein I do not bask in the “glory” of doing it all while I silently treat myself poorly-- accepting a life of sleep deprivation and other poor Self-loving behaviors simply because I aspire to do something great for the betterment of our Lives!  Thus, I openly embrace your support so that I can effectively usher the Darkness Cipher into its truest reflection of healing.</div><p>Your Contribution covers very essential aspects of the Cipher’s Development &amp; Production:</p><ol>
<li>
<strong>Cipher Products &amp; </strong><strong>T-shirt Production</strong>: ordering wholesale shirts, screen printing, packaging &amp; shipping of t-shirts worldwide (and a professional graphic designer to design over 13 visual ideas for t-shirts, books, album cover and accessories).  Paying for official U.S. Copyrighting services of art designs &amp; album and book manuscripts</li>
<li>
<strong>Where will the Cipher be held?</strong> : I’m a New Yorker.  That says it all.  Rehearsal and Production venues are snazzy and pricey.  And, to stay true to the aesthetic of the Cipher, it will be held in a space that reflects the love for my work and the love for the people in attendance (picture a museum…the main gallery of the Brooklyn Museum.  Picture A venue with a complete system: sound and lighting, stage, concessions, bar and vending options…) </li>
<li>
<strong>What are the Contents of the Cipher?</strong>: As An artistic infusion of musical storytelling, live thematic drawing and dance, the Cipher’s blueprint requires: Professionally trained Musicians (a live band) for intensive rehearsals with NYC youth who will receive training from professionally trained Dancers, Lyricists, Poets and Visual Artists versed in the Cipher’s blueprint.  I don’t believe in the narrative of starving artists…collaborating with artists from the Nuyorican Poet’s Café, Brooklyn Arts Council, etc…who function as quintessential Cipher pillars—facilitators, co-teachers, website developers…requires respectable compensation for their services (Remember, Séba needs her entrepreneur’s hats to abate from 100 to 50 J )</li>
<li>
<strong>Cipher Album &amp; Book: </strong>Studio Recording sessions, Mixing, Mastering &amp; Production of CDs (ancient but necessary)…editing and printing of Cipher Book</li>
<li>
<strong>Documenting the Cipher:</strong> Photography and Videography Services for you to capture this epic experience</li>
<li>
<strong>The Cipher’s Artistic Presence: </strong>Custom made outfits and artist props for Cipher performers: dancers, musicians, singers, poets and fine artists</li>
<li>
<strong>Cipher Support System:</strong> in addition to weekend rentals of a rehearsal space, middle and high school youth of NYC Youth participants need healthy snacks and assistance with transportation expenses and performance scholarships</li>
<li>

YOU</strong></h3><p>Séba’s Darkness Cipher is much more than a musical therapy session that brings the Cancers of joylessness, violent traumas and the fear of living the rest of one’s life with the singe of un-fulfillment, buried and fearfully ignored by so many, to the forefront.  The Cipher’s anthropologically cultivated and socially relevant artistry relaxes you like Reiki; grounds you with balance and flexibility like yoga, laughs with you with the charismatic humor of an old friendship and encapsulates you in the arms of a most loving embrace. </p><p>For people who have experienced aspects of Séba’s Cipher over the years, they have affirmed a profusely purifying wave of catharsis that flows through the at times, deeply depressed, anxious and stressed-out sentiments they experience in certain aspects of their lives and relationships.  They notice that they feel energized to really listen to the insomnia that cradles them with its defeating presence of helplessness.  The Energy of the Spirited Cipher inspires them to really stop procrastinating and to be more proactive about the insecurity they’ve been battling from the weight problems they’ve had since childhood.  And, last but certainly not least, they’ve asserted that Séba’s Immersing Cipher Sparks their imagination to really trust in themselves and ignite the aspirations they’ve been putting off because they are afraid of their own remarkable excellence and have succumbed to the condescending ideals/theories of other people. </p><p>Séba’s Cipher—a high dose of Rhythmic Alchemy is Something the Earth Can Feel!  The simple art/act of people getting together to heal one another (even if an individual is not personally suffering) sends a vibration deep into the Core of the Earth—the core of our collective Soul—our Ancestors, our lives and life to come.  This collective Vibration resonates as joy, love and light in every atom and realm of our collective and interconnected existence.  Séba’s Darkness Cipher exists to reflect the wisdom that we are all truly phenomenal…and every day, we ought to remember and breathe life into the reality of our esteem…our greatness despite the myriad atrocities of life. </p><h3><strong>WHAT IFS?</strong></h3><p>I’ve been cultivating this Cipher for a long time.  Nothing—fear, challenges—not even suffering stops me.  The first Cipher production at MOCADA (Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts) in 2015…though it did not generate a profit, it launched “The Spark that Ignites Being, Test of the Heart”, a literary masterpiece for Self-Development, Gift Ignition and Actualization!  This book is as alive today as the day it was published.  “Drawbacks” teach, they don’t distract me.  So, there are no what ifs with this campaign…because I will continue strategy, development, training and production after these stellar Cipher supporting 42 days.  Moreover, as an education and optimal wellness life coach, I have worked with people from a number of diverse backgrounds and disciplines.  My challenges and personal “setbacks” drive me.  They fuel me with even greater determination to give a voice to suffering—to the students who confided in me about being molested, bullied, abandoned…to the elders who have worked diligently their entire lives who are now crippled with dementia, arthritis, high blood pressure…to the children born with birth defects and learning “disabilities” who are stigmatized…to the imprisoned.  I do what I do because, like I said earlier…It is my calling.  As my calling, I will always seek the intuitive map of my “personal legend.”  Paoulo Coelho is on Point!</p><h3><strong>Anything Else…</strong></h3><p>Kindred Souls, we cannot shut our eyes and close our mouths to suffering—a historical and present day reality.  There is much that we can do…together.  Great mentors have said “think unlimited!”  So, think unlimited with me…help me to get the word out in every sector.  Give Séba’s Darkness Cipher a Shout Out on your fb page, twitter feeds, whatsapp groups, blogs, newsletters, etc.  (Indiegogo has a number of tools to help you make it happen!)  Truly, it is my love for humanity…to see us realize and actualize who we really are that makes life so amazing!  Can you feel it—the power and beauty of the greatness that you bring to life!?)  Oh, the light of our gifts, actualized, makes me feel so lifted!    Thank you, Tuau, Gracias…for your love and light Contribution!  I can’t wait to experience your greatness at Séba’s Darkness Cipher!</p><h3>Personalized Cipher Bookings</h3><p>Email ""Cipher Management"" at igniteyourspark01@gmail.com to book Séba's Darkness Cipher for Retreats and a variety of causes and events.  </p><h3>Staying Connected!</h3><p>Tweet @DarknessCipher, Instagram @LeapIntoYourWings, Subscribe to Séba’s YouTube Channel: Seba Warrior of Love and check out diverse cipher articles on Séba’s blog <a href=""http://www.iyealives.com/blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.iyealives.com/blog</a></p></div>","Why Cipher?I'm Living Strong So I can get THIS MUSIC OUT!

3. CONTRIBUTE TO RASÉ’s “LEAP INTO YOUR WINGS” PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: ILLUSTRIOUS GRAPHIC DESIGNING OF RASÉ’s SELF-ESTEEM IGNITING AND OPTIMISM VISUALIZING TEE-SHIRTS, BAGS AND PORTRAITS!

When you Contribute to the Production of Séba’s Cipher, you give Rasé Dynamo Arts the fuel to make the Cipher Really happen!  Our teaching artists will have the fuel to spend that vital time with the youth we’ve brought under our wings to teach them the intricate techniques and styles of Séba’s Rhythmic Alchemy Blueprint: the sequences of meditation, yoga, dance choreographies and musical compositions that bring awareness to suffering as well as the practices that empower OUR COLLECTIVE ABILITY to remediate suffering within OUR LIVES and the lives of our interconnected Village. What’s really STELLAR and perhaps very unique about Séba’s Cipher is that it is magnificently interactive!  Every participant who attends the Cipher will be immersed in the artistic infusion of Rhythmic Alchemy!  Every participant will have the opportunity to partake in the esteem lifting affirmations, the gift igniting musical storytelling, the imagination stimulating visual arts and dances that will be co-facilitated by the Stellar youth Rasé artists have trained! Séba's Darkness Cipher is the Creation of A Sacred Space, A Shrine, A Community for Ritual that gives voice to those who have been shut down and Silenced by the catastrophic reality of the cancer of Suffering that plagues many lives in the form of insomnia, depression, anxiety, violence, isolation, fear, dysfunctional relationships.Within the healing walls and purifying sea  of Séba's Cipher, we emphasize, through our art the ways in which we Call out suffering so that we can burn it out!  Call out suffering so that the intuitive ways in which we art to live our lives: courageously, making decisions that reflect Self-love and peace, health, wellness, happiness!--radiates luminously throughout every aspect of our lives—unlocking the gifts of all our treasure!It is RASÉ's mission to show our Youth and to share with all who are willing that which has transformed my life from being a prisoner to Suffering...to embrace revolutionary healing so that we may realize that it is absolutely vital that we not die before we each give life to our light!  Give light to those GIFTS that make your Souls Leap into the Unknown and return with  Stories that Create Legacies for Generations to Come!  For, our gifts are the essence of life, and like nutrients, our happiness and the Fruition of our gifts are Quintessential to this Existence and to all that live beyond...in the luminous Darkness, i.e. ""the unknown."" So, I invite you to contribute to the flourishing vision of Rasé Dynamo Arts!  And, I wholeheartedly thank you for your affirming contribution!  The very act of your effort catalyzes a Soul lifting and  Self-actualizing vibration that sparks genius and healing in so many Universal aspects of Life!  Take one of my hats, Please!I wonder how many persons know how many different types of hats an entrepreneur has to wear in order to make her dreams come true!  Fitting into so many different hats can become very exhausting and depleting.  Even though I am living my dreams...composing and producing music, creating different dance choreographies, drawing and designing Artwork for products (i.e. t-shirts, bags, etc), performing vital administrative functions (campaign development, promotion, sponsorship, grant writing)...these are a lot of hats because I also have to work in order to survive in NYC! (smile)  I am so grateful that I have connected to my purpose...but, truth be told, doing so much by my lonesome can create sentiments of suffering because it sometimes feels like so many people do not care.  And, to simply say a word about Rasé's efforts that gives something so dynamite and so Vital to our collective experience, is asking too much.  So, the indifference towards something that is not superficial, to something that we healing artists pour our Souls into everyday, I am unafraid to say, can be quite harsh.  So, I am asking you to please share one of my hats with me: contribute any amount you can to the Cipher, spread the world on your social media platforms, purchase a cipher keepsake at leapintoyourwings.com, invite Rasé to your next event.  Experience Us!   A Funny Hat StoryI'd never considered myself to be someone who can draw.  But I had to delve into this craft because I could not afford to commission an artist/graphic designer to design the images for my T-shirt ideas.  But, Eureka!  I can draw?  I can draw!  And, after endless YouTube videos, articles, and days of barely sleeping, I am now proficient in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop!  But, my!  Has the process been time consuming!  Truthfully speaking, I am not superwoman (wink).  And I strive to honor the morals of the Cipher which is to live a balanced life wherein I do not bask in the “glory” of doing it all while I silently treat myself poorly-- accepting a life of sleep deprivation and other poor Self-loving behaviors simply because I aspire to do something great for the betterment of our Lives!  Thus, I openly embrace your support so that I can effectively usher the Darkness Cipher into its truest reflection of healing.Your Contribution covers very essential aspects of the Cipher’s Development & Production:

Cipher Products & T-shirt Production: ordering wholesale shirts, screen printing, packaging & shipping of t-shirts worldwide (and a professional graphic designer to design over 13 visual ideas for t-shirts, books, album cover and accessories).  Paying for official U.S. Copyrighting services of art designs & album and book manuscripts

Where will the Cipher be held? : I’m a New Yorker.  That says it all.  Rehearsal and Production venues are snazzy and pricey.  And, to stay true to the aesthetic of the Cipher, it will be held in a space that reflects the love for my work and the love for the people in attendance (picture a museum…the main gallery of the Brooklyn Museum.  Picture A venue with a complete system: sound and lighting, stage, concessions, bar and vending options…) 

What are the Contents of the Cipher?: As An artistic infusion of musical storytelling, live thematic drawing and dance, the Cipher’s blueprint requires: Professionally trained Musicians (a live band) for intensive rehearsals with NYC youth who will receive training from professionally trained Dancers, Lyricists, Poets and Visual Artists versed in the Cipher’s blueprint.  I don’t believe in the narrative of starving artists…collaborating with artists from the Nuyorican Poet’s Café, Brooklyn Arts Council, etc…who function as quintessential Cipher pillars—facilitators, co-teachers, website developers…requires respectable compensation for their services (Remember, Séba needs her entrepreneur’s hats to abate from 100 to 50 J )

Cipher Album & Book: Studio Recording sessions, Mixing, Mastering & Production of CDs (ancient but necessary)…editing and printing of Cipher Book

Documenting the Cipher: Photography and Videography Services for you to capture this epic experience

The Cipher’s Artistic Presence: Custom made outfits and artist props for Cipher performers: dancers, musicians, singers, poets and fine artists

Cipher Support System: in addition to weekend rentals of a rehearsal space, middle and high school youth of NYC Youth participants need healthy snacks and assistance with transportation expenses and performance scholarships

Cipher Promotion & Continuity: compensation for Cipher manager, cipher booking agent, cipher facilitators and stagehands

On Crowdfunding:I have never tried to do a crowdfunding project before. To be honest, I realize what an imposition it is, and I feel uncomfortable about it. But, I won't let my fear of burdening you, or my own unease,  prevent me from trying to reach my goal.

Accountability:I will be as transparent and vocal as possible about the process. You can follow the campaign as I document it, day-by-day on my creative writing blog, ""Starting Small.""    Risks & Challenges Potential Issues:The most daunting hurdle of this project will be forcing ""art"" in 9 days. I also fear that the pressure of delivering to my friends and family what I promise will weigh on my soul.

How To Solve Them:I am best when I work under pressure. All my life, I have finished and completed projects and assignments because there were deadlines. This project has no ""deadline"" but it will be ever-present on my mind that YOU personally helped me achieve my dream of recording a full-length LP. 

The crowdfunding process will force me to work my butt off. I think I am capable and prepared - plus I have the support system in place that allows me to deal with any obstacle or challenge I face.

It will be motivating as hell to deliver on my promises, because I will have a personal connection from your contribution as a driving factor in recording this album.    Other Ways You Can Help THANK YOU!!!:The fact that you even took the time to consider this, read my words, and learn a little about my passion means the world to me. If you happen to know anyone who might feel compelled to donate, please spread the word.

SHARE!:It is easy to share this information with people across all social media platforms using Indiegogo's share tools!!! Just sayin' !",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Greetings, thank you so much for visiting my Indiegogo Campaign!</strong><br/>My name is Eluv, I am a Healing Music Artist, Intuitive Channeler, DJ &amp; Radio Show Host.</p>
<p><strong>Why sound healing?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>For me, music and sound healing is an act of love.</p></li>
<li><p>I love working with sound as a healing modality.</p></li>
<li><p>I love to share the joy I experience.</p></li>
<li><p>I am passionate about sound healing. It has transformed my life. It has carried me on its wings through difficult times. It has helped me soar to new heights when I take flight.</p></li>
<li><p>It has helped me assist others. Countless times I've witnessed sound healing positively transform the lives of others. (always exciting and super inspiring to be a part of)<br/><br/><strong>How do I create healing sound?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>I combine my vocals with a tapestry of pure tones of the Crystal Singing Bowls, lush harp strings, and other beautiful sounds.</p></li>
<li><p>The ethereal pure tones generated by the Crystal Singing Bowls are some of the purest and most powerful healing tones in existence.</p></li>
<li><p>I have an open-hearted intuitive approach to music/sound healing.</p></li>
<li><p>Objective: To create music to help uplift and awaken inner peace, joy, well-being, heart opening and deep relaxation in others. <br/><br/><strong>Why Alchemy bowls?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Each bowl has its own unique sound based on its composition.</p></li>
<li><p>In Alchemy bowls, Quartz Crystal is combined with precious gems, metals, minerals, and other elements in a magical process of true alchemy. </p></li>
<li><p>In using the Alchemy bowls multiple healing modalities are accessed: Sound Therapy, Color Therapy, Gemstone Therapy, Mineral Therapy &amp; Crystal Therapy and more. </p></li>
<li><p>They are lighter than the type I currently have.<br/><br/><strong>The Magnitude of your support...</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Your support will help cover costs of the trip, a set of alchemy bowls and equipment.</p></li>
<li><p>Your support will help make it possible for me to share this unique form of sound healing with music therapists from many different countries, some of whom have never experienced the Crystal Singing Bowls or Angel Harps.</p></li>
<li><p>Inspiring others to incorporate Crystal Singing Bowls into their own practice, opening new opportunities to help others to learn this modality...The possibilities are infinite!<br/><br/><strong>How fundraising works on this platform...</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Fundraising costs run between 8%-10% of total earned.</p></li>
<li><p>eg: for the $8000 goal of this campaign, between $640-$800 will go to fees.</p></li>
<li><p>Remaining actual funds raised =$7360-$7200</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Actual Amount Needed $12,569 (see below)</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For You...</strong></p>

<li>In choosing to support, huge, abundant thanks to you. Your support is amazing and so greatly appreciated. It is such a joyful expression and I am grateful. The ripple effect of your giving is infinite.</li>

<p><strong>""Octaves of Light"" with Hemi-Sync® Music by Eluv</strong></p>

<p><strong>Chakra Meditation with Hemi-Sync® album by Eluv</strong></p>

Located along the central line of the body, chakras receive and transmit life-force energy to our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies. When we experience unreleased emotions such as fear, anger or guilt, the energy flows less freely and can become blocked. The affirmations included here will help to optimize each chakra for an overall sense of well-being. Features two tracks; Track 1 is a 51-minute extended meditation to fully open and deepen the process; Track 2 is a 23-minute abridged version for a quick balance and alignment.</p>

</div></div>","Greetings, thank you so much for visiting my Indiegogo Campaign!My name is Eluv, I am a Healing Music Artist, Intuitive Channeler, DJ & Radio Show Host.
Why sound healing?

For me, music and sound healing is an act of love.
I love working with sound as a healing modality.
I love to share the joy I experience.
I am passionate about sound healing. It has transformed my life. It has carried me on its wings through difficult times. It has helped me soar to new heights when I take flight.
It has helped me assist others. Countless times I've witnessed sound healing positively transform the lives of others. (always exciting and super inspiring to be a part of)How do I create healing sound?
I combine my vocals with a tapestry of pure tones of the Crystal Singing Bowls, lush harp strings, and other beautiful sounds.
The ethereal pure tones generated by the Crystal Singing Bowls are some of the purest and most powerful healing tones in existence.
I have an open-hearted intuitive approach to music/sound healing.
Objective: To create music to help uplift and awaken inner peace, joy, well-being, heart opening and deep relaxation in others. Why Alchemy bowls?
Each bowl has its own unique sound based on its composition.
In Alchemy bowls, Quartz Crystal is combined with precious gems, metals, minerals, and other elements in a magical process of true alchemy. 
In using the Alchemy bowls multiple healing modalities are accessed: Sound Therapy, Color Therapy, Gemstone Therapy, Mineral Therapy & Crystal Therapy and more. 
They are lighter than the type I currently have.The Magnitude of your support...
Your support will help cover costs of the trip, a set of alchemy bowls and equipment.
Your support will help make it possible for me to share this unique form of sound healing with music therapists from many different countries, some of whom have never experienced the Crystal Singing Bowls or Angel Harps.
Inspiring others to incorporate Crystal Singing Bowls into their own practice, opening new opportunities to help others to learn this modality...The possibilities are infinite!How fundraising works on this platform...
Fundraising costs run between 8%-10% of total earned.
eg: for the $8000 goal of this campaign, between $640-$800 will go to fees.
Remaining actual funds raised =$7360-$7200
Actual Amount Needed $12,569 (see below)

<p>Following last year’s launch of the festival, these two veterans of the scene are joining forces to bring you an even more ambitious and unique event on board the legendary Ms Stubnitz. At this stage we need your help to give Primal Uproar an extra economic boost to make sure it happens at the highest possible standards. With your help, we will be able to bring you an event featuring a wide range of international artists to deliver memorable performances at this massive event. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the line up features more than 40 different artists travelling from all over Europe, Primal uproar need your help to make sure everything takes place according to plan. Our festival is run on a fully D.I.Y basis. To make it happen we’re completely dependent on ticket sales and whatever help you can give this campaign. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What Do We Need? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To make sure this festival runs smoothly and provides a strong basis for a 3rd edition in 2018, we need to make sure none of the artists end up “paying to play” and that the promoters don’t put in huge amounts of work and end up making a major loss. These are always risks when organising D.I.Y. events these days, but there is still a demand for bold, original and “underground” events. The only way this can happen is with your help, which as well as helping this event, will help the health of the scene in general.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What Do You Get? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have carefully made a list of unique perks to give you different options for everyone’s pockets. We offer everything from hugs, dinners, tapes, vinyl and boutique live performances in Berlin, Hamburg or London.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your contribution will be highly appreciated and will help in the making of our newly born industrial baby. The line up features a wide range of experimental, performance, noise and rhythmic music.</p>
<p>Taking place in the cavernous interior of the Stubnitz, these will be high impact and uncompromising demonstrations of today’s electronic avant-garde in action. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first edition of Primal Uproar happened in August 2016 and was a trial for what’s expected to be a long relationship with this impressive boat, bringing artists from all around Europe and cement our bonds with the cultural scene of the cosmopolitan city of Hamburg, Germany. For this 2nd edition, our plan is to be able to reward every artist and contributor in the way that they deserve. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you can’t contribute financially, there are other ways you can help by volunteering with us, so please get in touch to find out about the different ways in which you can help make this massive event happen. </p>

<p>Please spread the word out there and more than ever “Make Some Noise” and use the Indiegogo share tools to let the world know about it.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there! I am Jamie McDermid, i have been running NHC MUSIC now for over five years, I am passionate about helping as many creative people as possible find the means to self funding, this will enable them to keep doing the fantastic work that they do!</p>
<p>NHC MUSIC is volunteer run, by creatives such as those we strive to help, but since we started to grow, the bills started to grow too, meaning we needed more and more ways to raise the funds to keep doing the work we do. Usually we raised funds by running our own charity music nights three times a year, unfortunatly though, with a high percentage of our own fans living outwith Glasgow, and a bit of a surge in charity music events throughout the city, these just weren't enough on their own to keep the doors open. You asked for other ways to support us instead, and this is one of the best ways you can do just that!</p>
<p>The money we raise here will go towards upgrading and replacing a lot of our equipment at NHC, our laptops are on their lest wee electronic legs, our amps have seen better days and are in dire need or repair (or replaced), and the shop itself really needs a bit of an overhaul, before it starts clattering down around our ears! We have been doing our best with volunteer donations over the past few years, and recently have been supplying all the painting and equipment ourselves, but it's not enough. If we want to keep our projects going without inturruption then we really do need your help. Every penny we make goes right back into the local music and arts scene and helps it, and those within it, prosper. Life would be pretty dire without music and art, so let's help it blossom together for another year!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need our roof repaired on the inside of the shop from flood damage last year, we need new laptops as the ones we have at the moment have done us proud, but they are getting a wee bit more broken every day and truly are on their last legs, we need new shelving units fitted all over the shop, as the old ones are a bit wonky now and we really want to show off the works of the craftspeople and artists we distribute for in the shop in the best way we can! We also need a new solid front door, and a new sign at the front of the lane, as our door is one good kick away from being a swinging saloon door, and the signage at the street entrance was taken out by a rather large van a few months ago!</p>
<p>We don't want to just take and not give though, so we will offer you some cracking perks such as shop gift vouchers, limited edition 'I helped make the music and arts scene great again' T-shirts and badges, and even getting your name or that of your band painted onto the inside of our shop forevermore, that way you will truly be part of what we have created here, we will even make a wee video for you of the name getting painted on the wall within 48hours of the donation, and will then get it on the page and tag you into it! Every single penny we make during this once a year campaign will go towards some, or all, of the things we need, if we smash the goal then we get all our upgrades and repairs done, and the rest will just go right into helping new bands record and release new albums, or towards artists looking for some help with equipment themselves, nothing will go to waste. At NHC we feed the music, not the corporations!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If this campaign is succesful, then the impact will be tremendous. We can only help others with their own goals if we have the proper equipment to do so, therefor by helping us, you are helping others to fulfill their own dreams. Creating music and art for everyone to love. A thriving music and arts scene means a healthier, and happier city too, so it's a win win for everyone!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>As always, we are not just about the money at NHC MUSIC - There are others ways you can help us too, like these things;</p>
<p>You could help us greatly by sharing this campaign across your social media pages, and also by telling folk abotu the great work we already do at NHC MUSIC!</p>
<p>You could pop in to the shop and chat about volunteering some of your time, rather than cash, to help us in our work. We always need mopre people at NHC!</p>
<p>You could donate some stock to us at the shop, we work entirelly as a not for profit so the stock that we sell to keep our doors open is all totally donated by the people we work with. We take anything, from books to records, from old cassette tapes to cd's, from old vhs tapes to pre-owned video games, and of course we always take in music equipment and instruments of any kind, even if it needs repaired. That way bands and musicians who cannot afford their own equipment can borrow ours from the shop, at no cost to them. Being skint should never be a barrier to creating music.</p>

I'm Cilla Bonnie, and I'm happy to invite you to help me make my debut EP 'Somehow' this winter at Chillhouse Studios in Charlestown, Massachusetts. </h3><p> - Please take a moment to listen to the title track 'Somehow' just released on iTunes and Spotify to get a feel for the upcoming EP!</p><p><strong>A little about me!</strong> - I'm from a small town in Maine originally, and moved to Boston ten years ago at age twenty to pursue music. Plugging myself into the music scene has felt very natural to me and being a <i>female</i> bass player has always felt relevant to the role I play in the music scene. Being  a bass player and backup singer in bands is what I feel known and respected for - but it's time for me to make a recording that really represents my solo project to kickstart my solo career!</p><p><strong>About the EP</strong> - First of all, I hope you'll take a moment to listen to the title track/single 'Somehow' to get a glimpse at what the tone of this EP will be. I recorded this single in September with a stellar team of musicians, engineers and friends and am looking forward to getting in the studio with this great crew to record this winter. </p><p>The music on this EP will be showcasing bass, vocals and groove. Melodic motifs and minimal production are important elements to me to create a musical storyline that feels intimate, personal and can shine in it's natural state.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The concept of this collection of songs is all about how we hold matters of the heart. Heartache and heart mend, the hot and the cold. How does an ending breathe a new beginning? And, what does it feel like to <i>feel</i> it?

<h3>WHO ARE WE? NEREIDS? </h3>
<p>NEREIDS is a French metal band unique on the symphonic metal scene, hitting the stage since 2010. Unique? And why? The band combined with elegance the sound of chamber orchestra with the sounds of amplified instruments and have performed in some famous festivals such as PPM Fest in Belgium alongside Evergrey or Epica. The band's members Jérome (guitars), Antoine (lead guitars), Yann (bass), Manu (drums) and Camille (vocals) are willing for the best for the upcoming album. All the songs are already written and four of them have been performed live on the 17th of February in Miramas at l'Electrode. You didn't miss this show, right ? </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP? </h3>
<p>We would like to produce our album before the end of 2018. To do so, we need a certain amount of money : recording, mixing, mastering, printing the CDs, doing some promotion, <i>etc</i>... You might know that the process of creating an album have become really expensive. We need around 5500€. That's huge but we are truly convinced that thanks to your support we will succeed in gathering the right amount of money ! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHAT'S GONNA BE TOTALLY NEW? </h3>
<p>For the upcoming opus we are going to work with a full professional string orchestra. Goodbye samples, say hello to the real and powerful sound of highly talented classical musicians. This first step of recording took place in December in Grenoble (France)</p>
<p>You want to be actor of this ""grande premiere"" ? You can !</p>
<p><strong>SO ! You wanna help us to produce what will be our most accomplished album ? <br/><br/>If you want to be part of that wonderful project, it's up to you ! <br/><br/>And we have a lot of rewards for you : from signed copies of our new album to become our guest for one day of recording or hanging out with us after a rehearsal, you will find something that will please you ! Just check it out ! </strong><br/><br/>Thank you for your support ! <br/><br/>NEREIDS</p>
