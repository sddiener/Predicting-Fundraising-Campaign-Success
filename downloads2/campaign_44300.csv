<h2>What is the Backup Belt™?</h2>
<p>The
Backup Belt™ is a non-lethal, triple-threat, personal, safety device designed
to empower women to defend themselves if and when a sudden situation arises. It
was designed by a woman, for women. Ladies, it empowers us to defend ourselves
if and when it becomes necessary. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""349"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F118955461&amp;src_secure=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F118955461&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F118955461%2Fthumb%3Fref%3Dfb-newsfeed&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""620""></iframe></div><p></p>

<h2>Weapons on the Belt</h2>
<p>It
was created for active women everywhere; young or old; while working, shopping,
or at play. It is made of a durable, washable, material that has a Velcro
facing allowing multiple weapons to be affixed to the front of it. Every
weapon attached to The Backup Belt™ can
easily and immediately be accessed (in less than one second; faster than the
blinking of an eye). Easily enough time to make your presence known to
bystanders, law enforcement, or your neighbors. <br/></p><p><b>From our
factory, The Backup Belt™ comes with the following weapons: </b></p><ol>
<li><p>a loud, shrill personal alarm with easy pull cord (140dB), </p></li>
<li><p>an on-demand, easy-to-use canister of pepper
spray, </p></li>
<li><p>an easy-to-grip corkscrew (in a protective sheath).</p></li>
</ol><h4>The Alarm</h4>
<p>The
personal alarm at 140 dB (decibels) is so ear-piercing that it literally jolts
anyone within several hundred feet, makes dogs in the area start howling and barking,
and startles any would-be attacker.</p>
<h4>Pepper Spray</h4>
<p>The
pepper spray emits a pattern of approximately 2 feet in diameter, and a
distance of up to 15 feet. It is so potent that it can stop an attacker in his
tracks; if it gets in his eyes it will temporarily blind him giving you plenty
of time to leave the area.</p>
<h4>The Corkscrew</h4>

The
corkscrew with its pistol-grip like handle can be held so tightly it would be very
difficult to shake out of your hand. One jab inflicted from the corkscrew could
be so painful it could not only quickly deter an attacker, but in the process be
very likely to cause him to leave his DNA on the scene. DNA can be extremely
helpful to law enforcement in collecting evidence against the attacker. This is something criminals are very aware of today and
try to avoid at any cost.<div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Having spend enough time scouring the web for useable hdri images I took the plunge and invested in all the gear needed to create them myself. I've been doing this quite a bit now, and already have a small library that i use all the time. But I want to share it! And it should be bigger and better! So I decided to create a 100 image library of high quality material and put that up for sale. The problem I've run into though, is that I also need to work and care for my family, so it keeps ending up on the back burner. Not acceptable for something i have a weird passion for!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm a vfx artist(<a href=""http://www.spyfactory.tv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.spyfactory.tv</a>), having worked in the industry for 14 years now, doing feature films, commercials, music videos and tv series, so I know what i'm doing, and i know what it would take to make the material useable.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Moreover, I have created the website <a href=""http://www.renderschool.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.renderschool.com</a> which i'm working on filling up with high quality production level tutorials. There is already a free for all vray for maya 2hour tutorial in there.</div>

<p>So, whats in it for me and you:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all i need to recover some of the thousands of dollars i've invested in this project, buying gear and testing out. </li>
<li>Second, I need to be able to take the time away from work to create all this material in a professional manner so it's all ready for you to use.</li>
<li>You will get access to a HUGE library of HDRI images</li>

<h3><strong>The Bio</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Camille Taylor, the person who is called the quirkiest of them all was originally born in Detroit, Michigan and currently relocated to Atlanta, GA. At the tender age of 20, she moved to Atlanta without friends or family in pursuit of her dreams. It was the burning desire to embrace her often misunderstood creative character. Designing furniture was a curiosity which she developed as a little girl, telling her mom how she should put her bed in the wall. Her mother of course didn’t understand what she was trying to explain. As she became older, she began to see some of the greater things in life, and how she could contribute to the creative side of the world. Being a risk-taking rebel, she took it upon herself and developed Renee Taylor Designs. She sold her first sofa design in 2009, which her partner Michael and herself built in a small shop in East Point, GA. After building her 1st sofa, she knew anything was possible and her ideas could reach new levels. Currently she is working on the very first Men’s Furniture Line. The development of the site is in working progress and will launch this summer. The ideas she currently holds on that black and white clipboard is soon to turn furniture into fun and functionality. In her spare time, Camille draws new furniture pieces, cooks, pursues ice cream cravings, and owns a media company consisting of Film and Graphic Design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What's Happening Now!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Looking at the sofa above, all pieces will have character and inspired by some of the greatest objects. The seat is a suede and leather to the touch. The letters are patent leather red. The pillows are permanently attached. The back of the sofa is completely finished with the matching seat fabric. This sofa can sit against the wall or in the middle of a room.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Renee Taylor Designs is a furniture line made for unique homes. Their will be special collections built for industries such as lodging, television shows, and restaurants, and nightclubs. All furniture designed will be modern and contemporary with a bold finish!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Renee Taylor Designs will also have a special collection for the ""manly man!."" This collection is for the single busy bachelor who loves to impress the ladies.  This will consists of bold and earthy woods, alongside recylcled aluminum, and itialian leatthers. I'm excited about this line becuase sometimes the black leather couch just isnt enough!</strong></p>
<p><strong>How you can help? </strong></p>
<p><strong>This has been a dream for a long time, we finally have the resources needed, and the crew to make it happen. We are anxiously waiting on the go button. People who are kind enough to support the biggest dream in life, to take the feeling of emptiness away knowing goals have not been accomplished. This will change the normal way of how people think of furniture, and by using recycled materials in each piece, this also helps the environment.  </strong></p>

<p><strong>The goal of this campaign is to get a good head start on material costs, website, and manufacturing of furnishings such as headboards, chairs, sofa, and tables.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The start funding of the launch is 50,000. By budgeting profusely this gives us a good head start on producing each and every piece. We will be taking pre-orders for each unique piece. A cap on each piece will be placed so the likelyhood of someone else having it will be unlikely. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Different perks for contributors vary and can be your very own unique piece designed by Renee Taylor Designs. This perk is dependent on your donation to the start of our project. This excites us because at least we know our supporters will have something uniquely made for them that can be cherished. </strong></p>

StoryI'm a italian boy with a passion for the American wallet.I started the production because time ago I ordered a wallet, but it never arrived, so I decided to make one on my own. After a lot of tests, I found the right model.


Production
The wallet is made of excellent quality italian leather,great scent, with a special treatment to avoid damages due contact with water.
This treatment is very expensive, I'll be able to do it only raising at least 3500€, rising less, the color of leather will be different.

Our ultimate goal would be to create a unique group of watches that could span every style and innovation over the last 13 decades of wristwatch design. And so W. T. Author was created, a brand that spawned from the art of story-telling combined with limited edition, unique design. Our Indiegogo campaign introduces the first wristwatch, 'No. 1905' by W. T. Author. The project runs from September 13, 2013 - October 14, 2013 (11:59pm PT) to secure a deposit of £15,000 to assist in the manufacture of each individual component, and the exclusive items that come with each watch.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p

The case measures 46 mm across and 52 mm high including the shoulders. The case depth is 11 mm The dial utilises numbers taken directly from 1900's pocket watches and is enhanced with Author's unique hour markers.

Our ultimate goal would be to create a unique group of watches that could span every style and innovation over the last 13 decades of wristwatch design. And so W. T. Author was created, a brand that spawned from the art of story-telling combined with limited edition, unique design. Our Indiegogo campaign introduces the first wristwatch, 'No. 1905' by W. T. Author. The project runs from September 13, 2013 - October 14, 2013 (11:59pm PT) to secure a deposit of £15,000 to assist in the manufacture of each individual component, and the exclusive items that come with each watch.This includes:• The manufacture of the watch case• The production of the Swiss-made movement• The sourcing of the finest cow-hide for our leather straps• The manufacture of the watch straps• The printing costs for our limited edition book• The creation of our limited editon hand drawn screen prints• The manufacture of our custom-made packagingWe hope that with your help today this could be the start of an exciting 13 years to come. Below you will find the full product description as well as each individual perk outlined down the right hand side of the page.Thank you for your continued interest and support. We will be keeping you all updated with the exciting developments as we progress to the product's launch.  ~ W. T. Author 'No. 1905' Wristwatches by W. T.

T. Author Original Blueprint by master watchmaker W. T. Author    Product Overview  The first series of limited edition watches by W. T. Author. Every component has been designed and hand-finished exclusively by W. T. Author in Britain, and fitted with a Swiss made movement.The 'No. 1905' first edition watch draws inspiration from the turn of the 20th Century: a time when the first wristwatches for men were introduced by Louis Cartier and Edmond Jaegar. Taking inspiration from traditional aesthetics of the pocket watch, it reflects pioneering achievements of the era with signature shoulders brazed directly into the bespoke case allowing a hand-finished leather strap to be fitted. The case measures 46 mm across and 52 mm high including the shoulders. The case depth is 11 mm The dial utilises numbers taken directly from 1900's pocket watches and is enhanced with Author's unique hour markers. Traditionally formed custom-made hands complete the dial.The watch has been modernised with a beautiful enamel screw down case back, the signature red aluminium crown embossed with the Author trademark and a Swiss made 513S calibre movement.Every watch comes with an A5 book detailing the story of master watchmaker W. T. Author individually signed by the team and a limited editon A5 silk screen print available in 5 colours, again individually numbered and signed. The set is beautifully presented in a custom-designed package.      Individually Signed A5 Book 'No. 1905': The Story of W. T.

Making each strap as individual as the person wearing it, with its own unique story to tell.     Cow Hide Sourced from South American Tanneries • Sapphire coated mineral lens  • 2-year limited warranty The Manufacturing Plan  We have successfully secured and worked with eight collaborators from around the world to ensure we guarantee the product will be delivered to you on time and of the highest quality. The types of partners are outlined below (the kind of manufacturer, what they do, how they do it, and the order each component has been or is being made).   1. Watch Case Manufacturer  Specialising in the production of stainless steel watch cases, our watch case manufacturer provides services with exacting standards assisting with the technical development, quality production and full product testing. They are a dedicated partner and an important asset to our long-term business strategy. The final production samples have been signed off and ready to be manufactured if we reach our Indiegogo goal.     2. Movement Manufacturer  Our Swiss partner manufactures and sells Swiss made quartz wristwatch movements guaranteeing precision, reliability and high quality. The movement has now been selected for 'No. 1905' and will be fitted by skilled craftsmen into the watch case.     3. Leather Workshop  Supplying vast quantities of leather from South America, our manufacturer has assisted us in selecting the highest quality vegetable-tan cow hides. The leather has been selected to ensure maximum strength and yet has been designed to soften and mould to your wrist almost immediately. The leather has been bought and is now in the hands of the strap manufacturer, ready to be cut.      4. Strap Manufacturer  Based in the Lincolnshire countryside and using traditional methods of manufacture, skilled craftsmen will create our watch strap by hand. They will be cutting, splitting and embossing the leather to produce an item that reflects the quality of the watch case.     5. Book Printers  With over 19 years experience in the industry, our partners' expansive knowledge of the various types of printing means we understand all stages of production, from design and print to delivery. The book will serve as a vital component to compliment the story of W. T. Author, and will be signed by the team.      6. Silk Screen Printers  Our partner specialises in handpulled waterbased screen printing and brings a wealth of printing experience. They have offered us a friendly, personal service yet still deliver quick turnaround and quality products. Each limited edition print (available in 5 different colours) is designed by W. T. Author and will be individually numbered and signed.        7. Packaging Manufacturer  Our packaging manufacturer constantly aims to deliver quality cardboard packaging. They combine family business values with up to date production facilities. Their production teams have provided us with sound advice and access to an exceptional range of products and services. We wanted to get it right first time and by working closely with them, we have created a bespoke piece of packaging that reflects the quality of each individual product outlined above. We have just approved blank samples and are ready to approve the artwork ready for production.      8. Musical Collaborator   'Talk Less, Say More' has been instrumental in bringing all the design elements together in the form of a song that encompasses the very essence of our project. The track 'Seconds' is described by the artist below:    ""The idea is that it starts with an ambient drone, which gradually shifts into a single note striking at 60 bpm, like a second hand. Like a watchmaker, or indeed an author, it starts of with an environment, and in that environment he must create time (whether its measurement of, events, or feelings within time). The second hand strikes regularly on the E note throughout the track, keeping time.

Strapmount is secured using a standard ziptie and is easily removed and reused. The ziptie can simply be threaded through the mount, allowing you to mount your camera almost anywhere it is possible to mount a ziptie. It is very simply and takes only few seconds. </p><p>The GoPro camera simply slides into the mount, making it easy and fast to attach and remove the camera from the mount.

And how was it? Did you look good?</p><p>As a professional bag maker, we ask ourselves this question every day. </p><p>Since 2015, we started to make travel bags tailored for globetrotters, we studied their behaviors, invested heavily on tooling and prototyping, and we did all this to ensure every product we launch is perfect. </p><p>As a successor of our previous model BRIEFPACK, this Flypack was designed for frequent travelers and adventurers. You have a busy lifestyle. You travel a lot, work hard, and enjoy your personal life. The bag can convert into three different styles based on your needs: A briefcase for your daily work which fits everything you need: a 13"" to 17"" laptop, any sized iPad, electronics, books, all your cables, and everything you need for your day of work. It can also convert into a backpack for when you are tired of holding a bag; you can convert it anytime, anywhere.

<h2 style=""background-color:#444;padding:5px 10px;font-weight:normal;color:#fff;display:inline-block;"">SHORT SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Picture someone wearing a lot of skull designs – on their jacket, shirt, pants, all over. You’d know immediately what image they were trying to project. Now, do you picture that same person fitting into a professional environment?</p>
<p>High-paying workplaces often spell sartorial compromise. But there’s still a personality beneath every go-getter and team player. What if you could wear just one skull, in a strategic place where it looks smooth and subtly stunning? Could they pull it off in a professional ensemble?</p>
<p>French Yuppie recognizes the need in each person, yuppie or otherwise, to give a nod to their rebel soul, no matter what social context is holding them down. That’s why our new line is sure to get a look of admiration when noticed topping off your workday ensemble. It’s called “<strong>Cranium</strong>.”</p>
<p>3D-printed to our precise standards, our rings are cast in .925 Sterling Silver. We feature six varieties – five featuring the skull, and one fleur-de-lis whose contours hint at the cranial. Pick your favorite, or splurge on the entire collection if you’re all about skulls.</p>
<p>These rings retail at $220. But contributors to this campaign will get discounts the public will never see again – nearly 30% off.</p>
<p>The savings compound the more you contribute. And, for the distinguished buyer who can’t bear to split up this collection, we have an extra special offer. Receive 3 rings and one of our high-craft leather-and-sterling-silver bracelets for free – up to a $50 value.</p>
<p>Want to make it your own? Get it engraved on the inside, up to 13 characters. Looking for a bit of a different shade? We can cast these designs in gold or titanium. For an extra price, you can claim these custom features for a truly one-of-a-kind ring.</p>

WE MAKE CUSTOM DENIM JACKETS.We're here to change the denim game, for the better. With over two decades of combined experience in the apparel and Fash-Tech industries, we thought it was about time that the iconic denim jacket caught up to speed with today's discerning shoppers.WE THINK YOU'RE PRETTY SPECIAL.And we want you to wear it on your sleeve (literally). We believe that anything as essential as a denim jacket should meet your personal standards of quality, polish, and distinction, so we're offering you a way to collaborate on the design of your own VENIM jacket because we know that you've got something in mind.DESIGNED IN SAN FRANCISCO, MADE IN LOS ANGELES.It doesn’t get much more Californian than that, and with the best denim production standards in the nation, we wouldn’t have it any other way. We're proud to partner with transparent, environmentally-conscious, and socially-responsible factories in Los Angeles and we finish every jacket to your specifications at our studio in San Francisco.CUSTOMIZATION FTW.If you can do it yourself, then you probably don't need us. That's why we're focused on offering super rad customizable design features that you can't DIY or find anywhere else. Choose from a variety of classic denim washes, select your preferred button color, add striking finishes such as a metallic foil or vinyl racing stripe, and include functional accessories such as a removable waterproof hood or sherpa collar. WE'RE PRETTY SURE YOU CARE ABOUT THE PLANET.Same, here. That's why VENIM jackets are constructed from the excess yardage of other designer denim brands instead of milling our own denim. This saves millions of gallons of water per day, foregoing additional pollution caused by standard textile production processes.Every jacket is made-to-order to reduce excess inventory and is shipped in 100% reusable packaging.That being said, we've still got a long way to go when it comes to achieving our long-term goal of a circular product life cycle and we'd love your feedback on what you'd like to see more of (and what you could do without).  IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, WE ARE NOT A ""HERITAGE"" BRAND.We choose to look forward, toward a future of thoughtfully-designed and produced goods that leave no room for waste or obsolescence. We are not nostalgic for the industries of yesteryear. We have a global vision, so we're not going to try to sell you an ""All-American"" brand. It's been done, already.We also believe that while fundamental to the principles of great design, form, and function still need a little flavor. That's why we founded VENIM and we invite you to add your unique perspective to what's about to be your next favorite wardrobe staple.  THE QUALITY OF A $1,500 DESIGNER JACKET, THE FUNCTIONALITY OF A UTILITY JACKET, AND THE UNIQUE STYLE OF THE BADASS WHO'S WEARING IT. YOUR OPTIONS FOR CUSTOMIZATION.Start with a base jacket that meets your fit preferences, select from five denim washes, then choose your button color. Add bold, graphic finishes such as a metallic foil or vinyl racing stripe (with optional custom text) and purchase accessory add-ons with unprecedented performance features.This is only the beginning of something beautiful as we continue to add and refine our custom options...GET READY TO USE OUR SLICK AF CUSTOMIZATION TOOL.Your control center for building the VENIM jacket of your dreams. It updates your customized preferences in real-time, giving you a holistic view of your design, total price, and estimated fulfillment time from multiple angles.The best part? It's also mobile-friendly so that you can customize a jacket on-the-go (or from the comfort of your own spaceship). UNISEX SIZING AND FIT.We designed our jackets for humans. Are you a human? Fantastic. We're made for you. But because we understand that humans come in all kinds of shapes and sizes, we strive to do everything we can to accommodate as many body types as possible.We're starting out with a range of three unisex sizes and two options of length to set a baseline for our customers, but our job will never truly be done until we perfectly fit every human being on this planet that we call home. After that? Mars. Definitely Mars.   ""OKAY, BUT DO YOU HAVE MY SIZE?"" - YOU, PROBABLYChances are, yes! We chose to start out with denim jackets as our hero product because when it comes to a denim jacket, it's more about the look you're going for than the actual size that you're wearing. Confusing? We know. But look at this way...  You don't have to be Rihanna to rock an oversized jean jacket and similarly, you don't have to be Daniel Craig to sport a fitted look that's a little more rock n' roll. ""Fit"" is a look, so seriously, you do you. But just in case, here's a size table that shows what people are most likely to wear, based on the size of other items in their wardrobe:  We will be asking for your help and feedback along the way to improve our fits and expand our size ranges, so thank you in advance for bringing sizing issues to our attention and for helping us build a more inclusive product and brand. If you still don't think we have the size you need, we have a solution for you. Check out the ""Risks and Challenges"" section at the bottom of this page. WE HIT OUR FUNDING GOAL of $60,000 and can now reach our next milestone of producing 500 VENIM jackets, but we're still accepting preorders! The development is complete and we already have all the materials needed to make the jackets, so here's how your contribution will be spent:But we want to sell out of every reward so that we can take it a step further! The more money we raise, the faster we can deliver your order, because it enables us to hire more fulfillment staff. With extra funds, we can also start developing new accessory add-ons, like a detachable faux fur sherpa collar (just in time for winter) and we can begin working on collaborations with partnered brands and artists. Dope. Once this campaign has ended, we will distribute a survey to get a better understanding of the styles, sizes, and washes that our backers desire. (Don't worry: It's okay if you change your mind about this, later!)We will use this information to immediately place our first purchase order of 500 jackets from our factories in Los Angeles and to hire a kick-ass fulfillment team to help us complete and ship your order.  Once the first purchase order has been delivered to our studio, we will give all backers access to our Customization tool on www.venim.com. Here, you will be able to finalize all of the specific details of your desired jacket(s) and place your order with a unique checkout code that coordinates with your reward. This is also where you'll be able to purchase accessory add-ons to include with your reward shipment.We will begin fulfilling orders in November and will complete all shipments by early December, then it's on to round two (for March delivery). We will be in frequent contact via email, Kickstarter, and through our website, but you can always check in with us by emailing us at hello@venim.com! There are a limited number of rewards available, so we suggest that you pledge right now before everything sells out. Pledges of $295 and over are also available as a Gift Certificate, so consider giving the gift of VENIM to someone you know!  BACKED BY OUR 30-DAY INDIEGOGO GUARANTEEAll Indiegogo backers will be eligible for free returns (or exchanges) on their custom denim jacket purchases within 30 days of item delivery. You heard that right: Free returns, even if a jacket has already been customized to your preferences.Why?

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi, My name is Penny Miller and I am a Veteran, entrepreneur, nurse, inventor, and a typical mom: wearer of many hats. I invented this cool Keeper clip, which is patent(s) pending gift jewelry clip and clip on bow. </p>
<p>The idea came out of a grrrrr moment when I was wrapping presents Christmas Eve of 2011 and ran out of tape.  </p>
<p>Frustrated, I thought to myself "" why doesn't someone just make a clip on bow and I wouldn't need tape, the bag would be closed, present out of sight""  then I thought, ""yeah why doesn't someone?"" and so I did!</p>
<p>Everyone wants to have the prettiest present in the room and with gift jewelry, you surely will. It's super easy and very beautiful. </p>
<p>In our attempt to improve the clip, we took it a step further. We made the clips key chains and ornaments too. Now, many styles even come with bottle openers. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Keeper clip make anyone look great and support green giving by allowing all the wrapping to be re-used. The clip is the perfect compliment to any gift while making your life easier and the world greener. No compromise necessary.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to take the virtual designs we have created and turn them into real product.  </p>
<p>That requires 3D CAD drawings for each, and a mold with solid models.  Each one requires $1,000.00 to get into production.</p>
<p>We need those funds so we can bring the new designs to you.</p>
<p>In return, we will send you some of these amazing Keeper clips and let the world know how great you were in supporting us.  Be part of making the world a better place with style and function.</p>
<p>Have a campaign of your own on IndieGoGo?  Let us know and we will support you too.  This is a community after all.</p>

How many times have you had to change in public, such as at the beach, people watching you wriggle every which way while trying to avoid baring all?You grab a towel, wrap it around you, it falls and everything is visible! The Spaxe Dress has been created for YOU!
Slip on the dress from the bottom, pull it up and over your clothes. Then you can simply undress, hidden from prying eyes. In less than 30 seconds you are ready!

What we need and what you get

We have developed the Spaxe Dress to be easy to slip on and remove. We have also created various modern designs to please every one of you ladies; designs ranging from ethnic chic to your national flag!  
Due to the manufacturing process using superb textiles, the Spaxe Dress offers exceptionally vivacious colours that resist years of wear, repetitive washing at 90°, even bleach! 

The cutting of the Spaxe Dress has been conceived to complement all body types, whatever your cup size, whether you are tall or short, full figured or slim! Once your order has been confirmed we will advise you on which size to choose to ensure you have a magnificent dress that doesn’t trail on the ground.

</div></div>","The classic yet modern design coupled with the functional expandable size and instant access pocket make it the one bag you can rely on, whether it is for business, photography and even the overnight travels.Our daily routine is less of a routine and more of a set of activities that happen alongside the ones we were expecting that day. We found ourselves having to switch between one bag to another for primarily two reasons: size and design. That is why we set out to create a bag that would be by definition flexible, one that we could proudly take wherever you go. On average we use a bag on more than 300 out of 364 days so it’s time to take out the right one! 
 

 
The front pocket is always the handy option for quick access to your camera gear. Easily open it with one hand to take out your camera or switch between lenses.
 
Do you know that feeling when you pack your bag to the limit and then you find that there is an extra zip that you can open to expand your bag? Inspired by the larger travel luggage, we wanted to bring this convenient feature to our daily bag. Because there is no single ideal size, the 48Hr Classic adapts to your needs by expanding 70% from its original size.
 
Need to get out of town for a couple of days? Sure, just expand the 48Hr Classic and get packing for the journey. Often I would pack everything into a bag to get me there and then I would find that I needed another one to move around the city. We designed the 48Hr Classic to fix this problem so now you can zip up the expandable compartment and it becomes a compact messenger that you can carry during the day. Expand it to travel there and zip it back up for everyday useIt is time for a bag that combines a discreet exterior with a smart interior. Inspired by the classic briefcase shape, we began reimagining our expectations, from a design as much as a functional point of view. That is why the 48Hr Classic is everything you would expect from a premium, practical bag and much more. Your essentials are always easily accessible when you need them.
   




 


 
 
 
 

 
 
 

All 48Hr Classic Bag backers will receive a leather shoulder pad. If you wish to get a 2nd shoulder pad with your reward, please add $10 to your current pledge and send us a quick message to let us know.
More often than not, we found that it’s better to be more elegant than your surroundings than the opposite. For example going to a business meeting with your gym bag will look more out of place than heading to the gym with your business messenger bag. 
With this practical aspect in mind we created an elegant, stylish design that makes you feel comfortable wherever your day takes you. 
 Now there is no need to switch between your office and casual bag 

 

   With our 13 or 15’’ laptop becoming an indispensable part of our lives, we made sure that you can carry it around in a separate padded compartment protecting it from outer elements as well as from other interior objects which may scratch it. 

 
 The all leather strap will turn the 48Hr Classic into a backpack for a comfortable commute on your bike or long walks when you want to free up your hands.Whether it will be your work bag, camera bag or carry on bag, or all these things, the 48Hr Classic is up for the task!

 The 24 & 48Hr Classic Bags are made from premium Italian full grain leather chosen for it's aesthetics, fibre strength and durability. The grain also has breathability, resulting in less moisture from prolonged contact. Rather than wearing out, it develops a patina during its expected useful lifetime. We carefully choose each hide and opt to leave most natural small marks as we believe it adds to the character and beauty of the leather. 
  Even more important than the design, the Temporary Forevers brand is about pledging towards something that makes you feel unique, makes you feel better for having a bag that you don’t see everywhere and if you ever do happen to come across someone with a 48Hr Classic Bag, we hope you will smile to them for having something different in common.
 
Thanks to our team of Kickstarter backers, the following extra upgrades will be included to all 48Hr Classic bags! UPGRADE 1: Zips – YKK Yes that’s right, your 24 and 48Hr Classic bags will now come with YKK zips!

 After having almost ran out of time we decided to extend our campaign and to celebrate xmas and the new year’s we are adding two new perks!! 
Blocks Zero Fully Assembled Early Bird

It has also came to our attention that sometimes flexible funding campaigns do not deliver the perks!Blocks was established in 2014 and since then we have sold hundreds of machines like the Blocks One or the Custom (check www.blockstec.com). We want to reassure you and explain why our team’s decision was to opt for the flexible funding. For us this is more of a pre-order and a chance to let you know about us than required funding.So every single contribution will be delivered, even if we don’t meet our funding goal!! Blocks Zero Prints Video Reviews & Unboxing

EN: Toucane is
an original brand based in Madrid, Spain, dedicated to an original lifestyle
with an edge.
We started
out with an idea:  we would reinvent the
casual shoe. ES: Toucane es una marca original nacida en Madrid, España, enfocada a un estilo de vida original y diferente.Empezamos con una idea: reinventaríamos la zapatilla tradicional.EN: We noticed
all shoes had the same white soles, perhaps a shoe with something different
here or there, but none of them had a real pronounced uniqueness. 
So we
thought, why not make some good looking shoes for people who want to stand out
from the crowd? Why not be
different?
Maintaining
style and quality without sacrificing affordability, we would design a
noteworthy shoe.
Toucane
shoes are unique, like…well, like Toucans. We are singular and colorful. We are original!ES: Nos dimos cuenta de que todas las zapatillas suelen tener las suelas blancas sin ninguna diferencia realmente pronunciada.Así que pensamos, ¿por qué no hacer zapatillas diferentes para gente que quiera destacar entre la multitud? ¿Por qué no se diferentes?Manteniendo el estilo y la calidad, a buen precio, diseñaríamos una zapatilla original.Las zapatillas Toucane son únicas como... los tucanes. Somos singulares y coloridos. ¡Somos originales!    EN: Toucane's are made of two pieces of dyed canvas clothe, cut, emroidered and printed to achieve that original look.The soles are vulcanized and 100% natural rubber, which provides greater elasticity, strength and comfort. They are dyed in Pantone colors to mesh perfectly with the upper canvas body.
Are you willing to risk missing out on the
colored sole trend?ES: Las zapatillas Toucane están hechas de dos piezas de canvas teniñas, reforzadas, cortadas, bordadas y estampadas para conseguir ese aspecto original.Las suelas son vulcanizadas 100% de goma natural, lo que proporciona mayor elasticidad, resistencia y comodidad. Unas suelas teñidas en colores para combinar a la perfección con el cuerpo de la zapatilla.¿Te vas a quedar fuera de la tendencia de las suelas de colores?

<p><b>Wear&amp;Toss™ </b>means biodegradable,
sustainable clothing, economically and environmentally friendly, to be worn, to
be enjoyed, and to be disposed of responsibly and with no regrets.</p>
<p><b>Creativity </b>is the economic
engine of the future and it is in everything we do at Wear &amp; Toss® where
our customer is at the center of all we do.</p>
<p><b>Eco-Friendly </b>is the
extraordinary element of innovation developed by Wear &amp; Toss® for the
textile industry that has yet to find a truly efficient and effective solution to
the environmental impact of its products.</p>
<p><b>Sustainable Development </b>means for the
textile industry sustainable, non-conventional products: </p>
<p>1) The use of raw materials
derived from natural sources. </p>
<p>2) By employing environmentally
responsible, simplified yet automated technological processes in the
construction of the garments.</p>
<p><b>Green Technology </b>in the supply
chain and the processing of the Wear&amp;Toss® cloth compared to the
traditional cotton supply chain, allows for considerable savings in terms of
resource use and the release of harmful substances into the environment,
representing the new frontier of eco-friendly clothing. In figures: - 85 % of
cultivated territories occupied, - 95% of the water required in the production
process, - 75% of carbon dioxide emissions, - 94% of chemicals used during the
entire production chain.</p>
<p><b>Economical </b>A small price to
pay (approx. 2€ RRP per T-shirt) frees our customer from strong economic ties
to the item of clothing easing disposal. </p>
<p><b>New Life Style </b>A real revolution
in life style liberating the consumer from the cleaning cycle tasks; wash,
consumption, recycling.</p>
<p><b>Use </b>the clothing
item’s life cycle is greatly reduced, dictated to mainly by the seasonality of
fashion, and the wear and tear and soiling of the item. The item’s low cost
favours repurchase.</p>
<p><b>Fast Fashion </b>Wear&amp;Toss® is
the simple solution for ""Fast Fashion"": In this age of unbridled
consumerism, what is new and original today, is old tomorrow. Wear &amp; Toss®
has come up with the first example of biodegradable disposable clothing.</p>
<p><b>Packaging </b>pocket-sized
packaging facilitates storage and transportation.</p>
<p><b>Free Time </b>The washing
machine and iron are no longer necessary, thanks to Wear &amp; Toss® clothing item’s
reduced life cycle giving you a substantial increase in free time, raising to
the nth degree those very concepts of wellness and renewal.</p>
<p><b>Applications </b>The Wear &amp;
Toss® technology can be applied in many sectors, from fashion to sport, from
work wear to military uses, from cosmetics to bio-medical, representing a great
opportunity to explore new markets and review so new ones. </p>
<p><b>Competitors </b>The economic
crisis, the lack of innovative textile products and the awareness and need of
""green"" products are favourable to quick market entry and penetration.
Today, there is no direct competitor with a product with similar
characteristics.</p>
<p>We mean to make the brand
name Wear &amp; Toss® a leader, unique and original, in eco-friendly textiles
and stay ahead of the competition.</p>

<p>Compared to traditional fibres taken from fossil fuels, the fibres used by W&amp;T have excellent <b>biodegradability and compostability</b> properties which is why they can be considered the <b>fibres of the future</b>.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/671293/files/20140624043434-materiale.jpg?1403609674"" src="""" style=""""/></p>These kinds of raw materials have already been used by some large commercial chains for the production of packaging and disposable plates, cups, gloves and clear plastic wrap.<br/><p></p><p>
</p><h4><b></b></h4><h1>Process</h1><p>The production line and transformation of <b>WEAR&amp;TOSS™</b> fabrics is based on three key aspects: mechanisation, energy efficiency and respect for the environment.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/671311/files/20140624044652-processo1.png?1403610412"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>The <b>high level of mechanisation</b>, capable of producing up to 100 items a minute, makes it economically viable to produce in loco and reduces the exploitation of workers from developing countries.

<p>In the knowledge that the energy needs of a textile production company represent on average 30% to 50% of their total costs, <b>W&amp;T</b> uses innovative technologies and machinery <b>which use less energy</b> and have <b>zero environmental impact</b>.</p><h4><b></b></h4><h1>Disposal</h1><p>The most revolutionary characteristic of the 100% biodegradable <b>WEAR&amp;TOSS™ </b>product is that it can be recycled or composted.<br/></p><p></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/671317/files/20140624045106-smaltimento1.png?1403610666"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><b>
</b><p><b>Biodegradability</b> is the ability of organic substances and some materials to decompose and be assimilated by microorganisms (bacteria) in the soil so as to become part of the natural cycle once again. <b>Compost</b> is a collection of highly fertile organic substances which derive from the biodegrading of organic materials (waste).</p><p style=""display: inline !important;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/671319/files/20140624045130-compost.jpg?1403610690"" src="""" style=""width: 582.9310344827586px; height: 230px;""/></p><p></p><p><b></b></p><p style=""display: inline !important;""><b>

Wear&Toss™ means biodegradable,
sustainable clothing, economically and environmentally friendly, to be worn, to
be enjoyed, and to be disposed of responsibly and with no regrets.
Creativity is the economic
engine of the future and it is in everything we do at Wear & Toss® where
our customer is at the center of all we do.
Eco-Friendly is the
extraordinary element of innovation developed by Wear & Toss® for the
textile industry that has yet to find a truly efficient and effective solution to
the environmental impact of its products.
Sustainable Development means for the
textile industry sustainable, non-conventional products: 
1) The use of raw materials
derived from natural sources. 
2) By employing environmentally
responsible, simplified yet automated technological processes in the
construction of the garments.
Green Technology in the supply
chain and the processing of the Wear&Toss® cloth compared to the
traditional cotton supply chain, allows for considerable savings in terms of
resource use and the release of harmful substances into the environment,
representing the new frontier of eco-friendly clothing. In figures: - 85 % of
cultivated territories occupied, - 95% of the water required in the production
process, - 75% of carbon dioxide emissions, - 94% of chemicals used during the
entire production chain.
Economical A small price to
pay (approx. 2€ RRP per T-shirt) frees our customer from strong economic ties
to the item of clothing easing disposal. 
New Life Style A real revolution
in life style liberating the consumer from the cleaning cycle tasks; wash,
consumption, recycling.
Use the clothing
item’s life cycle is greatly reduced, dictated to mainly by the seasonality of
fashion, and the wear and tear and soiling of the item. The item’s low cost
favours repurchase.
Fast Fashion Wear&Toss® is
the simple solution for ""Fast Fashion"": In this age of unbridled
consumerism, what is new and original today, is old tomorrow. Wear & Toss®
has come up with the first example of biodegradable disposable clothing.
Packaging pocket-sized
packaging facilitates storage and transportation.
Free Time The washing
machine and iron are no longer necessary, thanks to Wear & Toss® clothing item’s
reduced life cycle giving you a substantial increase in free time, raising to
the nth degree those very concepts of wellness and renewal.
Applications The Wear &
Toss® technology can be applied in many sectors, from fashion to sport, from
work wear to military uses, from cosmetics to bio-medical, representing a great
opportunity to explore new markets and review so new ones. 
Competitors The economic
crisis, the lack of innovative textile products and the awareness and need of
""green"" products are favourable to quick market entry and penetration.
Today, there is no direct competitor with a product with similar
characteristics.
We mean to make the brand
name Wear & Toss® a leader, unique and original, in eco-friendly textiles
and stay ahead of the competition.
The IdeaOften the best ideas come from looking at daily life from a new point of view. The Wear&Toss™ project started in August 2008 when Filippo De Martin, holidaying with his family, realised that an inexpensive single-use t-shirt was the solution to the problem of his kids clothes getting dirty and needing to be washed and/or the need to travel with a lot of changes. An ecological t-shirt that would be bought wherever you travel and which can be recycled after use.That was the moment the Wear&Toss™ project came to life, a project which is now fully under way and ready to meet and satisfy the needs of today’s consumer.Biodegradable Single-Use ClothingWear&Toss™ is a new concept for inexpensive ecological clothing designed to be worn and disposed of simply and quickly. The product is a genuine revolution in life style: wear-use-recycle.Wear SustainabilitySuitable for use in a range of sectors – fashion, sport, workwear, medical – the Wear&Toss™ project makes use of innovative materials and production techniques which reduce running costs while guaranteeing excellent quality and zero environmental impact.Fast fashion? Sustainable fast wear!In the era of right now and rampant consumerism what’s new and original today is already old tomorrow and ready to be changed. The W&T project is ahead of its time and leads the way to future consumer models by presenting the first biodegradable single-use clothing.         A new revolution Every revolution starts with a belief and the WEAR&TOSS™ project is, first of all, just this.  A belief based on an explosive concept that turns the status quo on its head and brings tomorrow’s dreams to life today. A discovery with a huge impact which will have an extraordinary effect on everyday life.Just like a work of art, it’s not simply the sum of its parts that makes this project so special. The WEAR&TOSS™ project isn’t just another disposable product or cheap clothing concept. It’s this but also much more. It’s not only one of the many alternatives on the market but a real alternative to the market, a genuine response to fast fashion.Think GreenIts ecological credentials are the first, most extraordinary, element of the innovation proposed by WEAR&TOSS™. While in other sectors the issue of the disastrous impact of its products on the environment has been faced, up to now this has not been true of the textile sector.WEAR&TOSS™ is aimed at a new generation of consumers who, becoming increasingly dissatisfied with traditional products, are making respect for both the environment and workers essential factors when selecting a product.
WEAR&TOSS™ is sensitive to both nature and society (and in a broader sense to urban planning, architecture, design etc.) as it follows balance and beauty via a perfect combination of history, culture and innovation which come together to create freedom of movement and emotion. The freedom to choose a unique eco-sustainable product that actively involves the consumer in its creation and development in all phases of its manufacture.More free timeAmong all the domestic appliances that fill our homes the one that has had the greatest impact is the washing machine. Why is this?After the second world war there was a time of immense growth and industrial rebirth so companies strived to come up with answers to the increasing demand for a better way of life by producing, among other things, a machine that would free the household of one of the most time-consuming tasks: washing clothes and linens. During these years existing washing machine models were improved in a way which also had a profound effect on the emancipation of women.But progress doesn’t stop and now the incredible innovation that was the washing machine is about to be surpassed by a revolution of no less significance, ecological single-use clothing.
Not just the washing machine but also the iron and the clotheshorse will become less important as disposable clothing items become more common. This in turn will lead to more free time, leading to an improvement in wellbeing and freedom in the same way as the washing machine did in the last century.Between Today and Tomorrow
The concept of sustainable development is based on a very precise aim, to improve economic and social conditions by integrating growth with a strong sense of environmental responsibility. The idea is to fulfill the demands of people today without compromising the ability of future generations to satisfy their needs.
Development models which work hand-in-hand with the environment, the economy and society as a whole can succeed only by promoting innovative production and consumer models that focus on utilising renewable resources, on the environmental impact of processes and on a careful analysis of the impact of these goods and services during their life-cycle.
                     Wear&Toss™ is committed to protecting the environment and to promoting responsible consumerism by introducing radical changes to the textile sector which range from providing unconventional products to advances in technology and processing. The project is aimed at a global evolution of the concept of “sustainable clothing”.Raw materialsWear&Toss™ is an innovative family of fabrics that use fibres taken from renewable sources such as cellulose, beetroot, corn starch and sugar cane.
Compared to traditional fibres taken from fossil fuels, the fibres used by W&T have excellent biodegradability and compostability properties which is why they can be considered the fibres of the future.These kinds of raw materials have already been used by some large commercial chains for the production of packaging and disposable plates, cups, gloves and clear plastic wrap.
ProcessThe production line and transformation of WEAR&TOSS™ fabrics is based on three key aspects: mechanisation, energy efficiency and respect for the environment.
The high level of mechanisation, capable of producing up to 100 items a minute, makes it economically viable to produce in loco and reduces the exploitation of workers from developing countries. The project also allows companies to reduce the enormous costs of international transport and therefore also the pollution it causes.
In the knowledge that the energy needs of a textile production company represent on average 30% to 50% of their total costs, W&T uses innovative technologies and machinery which use less energy and have zero environmental impact.DisposalThe most revolutionary characteristic of the 100% biodegradable WEAR&TOSS™ product is that it can be recycled or composted.
Biodegradability is the ability of organic substances and some materials to decompose and be assimilated by microorganisms (bacteria) in the soil so as to become part of the natural cycle once again. Compost is a collection of highly fertile organic substances which derive from the biodegrading of organic materials (waste).
In a very short time WEAR&TOSS™ clothing disposed of in the ground or through recycling centres decomposes into water and carbon dioxide, two elements which are essential in the chlorophyllic photosynthesis of green plants. This process therefore contributes to maintaining the ecological balanceof the planet.

Wear&Toss™ vs CottonIs cotton a natural fibre? Yes it is. Is it a sustainable fibre? Absolutely not. This is because it is produced using processes which are harmful both for the environment and for humanity.
The 25 million tonnes of cotton produced each year have an enormous impact because of the use of pesticides (10-20% of the total used in all forms of agriculture), water consumption (about 2000 litres of water for a t-shirt) and transportation-related pollution (use of fossil fuels and C02 emissions).Compared to the manufacturing processes used for cotton, the production line and transformation processes for the WEAR&TOSS™ fabric provide a significant saving in terms of the exploitation of natural resources and the production of harmful substances and therefore represent a new frontier in eco-sustainable clothing.Versatile ProductAs Wear&Toss™ fabric is made from a variety of fibre types it is suitable for use in a wide range of products. Extremely versatile and fully customizable, it is soft and light as well as very strong with excellent textile and mechanical properties.                                                         SINGLE-USENo more washing machines and irons. After use a Wear&Toss™product can be disposed of and recycled in the conventional way. The life-cycle of the item is very short.                                                     ECO SUSTAINABLEThese are totally biodegradable clothing items from a production line created based on high environmental consciousness.Wear&Toss™ products, made from raw materials such as cellulose and corn starch, respect both the natural and human resources used in their production.                                                        ISOTROPICWear&Toss™ fabric is isotropic which means that is maintains the same properties and physical characteristics in all directions. This ensures it keeps its shape very well and clothing made from this fabric is both resistant and strong.                                                 ELASTICOne of the unique features of Wear&Toss™ fabric is its excellent elasticity (an intrinsic property of the material) which makes it extremely malleable and flexible in all circumstances without losing shape when under pressure.       INEXPANSIVEThe revolutionary technology used by Wear&Toss™ reduces production costs when compared to more traditional cotton production. The products are so inexpensive that consumers will be happy to buy them again and again and will stop forming emotional attachments to their clothing items.                                               STABLEWear&Toss™ products do not release fibres or dust particles as the microfilaments which make up the fabric are highly stable. The fabric is therefore ideal for use in medical environments where dust particles can potentially have a serious effect on clinical procedures.                                               BREATHABLEWear&Toss™ clothing, irrespective of the kind of mix used, is very comfortable and provides maximum breathability. This means it allows the skin to breathe while limiting the build-up of sweat and promoting the rapid elimination of condensation.                                               ALLERGY-FREEThe solid compact structure of Wear&Toss™ products provides excellent protection of the skin against allergens produced by dust mites as they are very efficiently contained by the fabric.                                               MICROENCAPSULATIONThe Wear&Toss™ fabric is ideal for the insertion of microcapsules that provide added value to the product and increase potential areas of use. The microcapsules can be of a variety of types, in particular with perfumed, pharmaceutical or antiseptic properties.Infinite ApplicationsLight, comfortable and breathable, the WEAR&TOSS™ fabric is suitable for use in a wide range of sectors from fashion to sport, from workwear to military clothing, from cosmetics to the bio-medical sector, and represents a fantastic opportunity to exploit as-yet untapped markets or even to create new ones. The WEAR&TOSS™ fabric as a finished product can be manufactured with antibacterial, hydro-repellent, fire-resistant, and UV protection properties and therefore effectively responds to the needs of a diverse range of consumers (private, corporate or institutional).                                          FASHIONIn the Fashion sector where things are constantly changing the WEAR&TOSS™ fabric is absolutely ideal as it embodies the essential values on which the fashion sector is founded: seasonality and speed. In contrast with international catwalk fashion, W&T provides access to practical and inexpensive clothing that everyone can enjoy, from adults to children and business professionals to housewives, without having to give up on the style and character of global fashion trends.                                         SPORTSingle-use t-shirts that can be disposed of after use.WEAR&TOSS™ sports underwear solves the problems of repeated washing of sports underwear as well as the weight of carrying many changes by introducing innovative odour-free garments that effectively neutralise the unpleasant effects of sweat.                                         WORKWEARIn sectors where work clothing is subject to intense use and quickly wears out, WEAR&TOSS™ clothing is an ideal solution. At the end of the day the used and soiled garment can simply be thrown away without the need to worry about tears, stains or abrasions.                                         BIO-MEDICALHospitals and private clinics, pharmaceutical companies, analysis labs, rehabilitation centres and rest homes are all areas where WEAR&TOSS™ products are ideal. This is because hygienic, sterile materials and clothing for both patients and personnel are essential so as to prevent bacterial and viral contamination. WEAR&TOSS™ products are much better for these uses than traditional cotton fabrics as they are more stable and offer higher levels of protection. The clothing can also be manufactured with micro-encapsulated vaccines and antibiotics.                                        COSMETICSCosmofabrics – from a combination of fabrics and cosmetics via microencapsulation – is a fast-growing market. The nature of the WEAR&TOSS™ fabric makes it particularly suitable for containing active ingredients in the fibres (hydrating, repellent, deodorant etc) which are then released onto the skin in a controlled and progressive manner.                                      CHARITIESLarge international charities like The Red Cross, UNICEF and the WFP deal on a daily basis with large-scale humanitarian emergencies often in remote locations where water or washing facilities are difficult to come by and effective sterilisation very hard to guarantee. WEAR&TOSS™ clothing, with a production line that can produce thousands of pieces in a very short time, is an effective solution to this problem.                                     ACCESSORIESAccessories can be produced for the automotive, household goods, sporting items, food and transport sectors.                                     UNDERWEARWhether for business, study or pleasure the one thing you can’t do without on a trip is underwear. Undershirts, vests, lingerie and socks all take up space in the bag and then need to be washed. WEAR&TOSS™ is a practical alternative to traditional underwear, not just when travelling but also in everyday life.                                     ISTITUTIONSLarge national and international institutions often need hygienic and safe equipment (canvas, blankets, accessories) and clothing items (uniforms, overalls, scrubs) which can be made available rapidly. WEAR&TOSS™ products provide a wide range of both finished and semi-finished products which require no washing or maintenance.                                   MERCHANDISINGPromotional t-shirts that catch the eye and care for the environment. Companies and public bodies (hotels, restaurants, gyms, spas, museums, local government) will find WEAR&TOSS™ products can be used to support their communication strategies with personalised clothing itemsfor distribution at fairs, events, conventions etc.W&T Brand Management
W&T is the main brand for the project which includes Wear&Toss™, T-Shirt Way™ and DayByDay™. Each of these products is different in type, sector and application. They are used to offer single-use clothing, accessories and semi-finished fabrics to families, companies and institutions. W&T is the part of the project dedicated to brand building and the development and co-ordinated, integrated expansion of each of the other brands.The Wear&Toss™ brand presents a new family of ecological biodegradable fabrics derived from cutting-edge technological research. This has resulted in the registration of numerous international industrial trade marks in the sectors of materials, processes and know how.With Wear&Toss™ products everyone, from new-born babies to pensioners, can have access to the most suitable clothing or accessory made from a disposable fabric, whenever necessary.                                                         DayByDay™ is the brand from the W&T project which aims to move into the mid-high end of the fashion market, a market governed by a single rule: what’s fashionable today will already be old tomorrow.In this context the ecological disposable fabric used in Wear&Toss™ products is the ideal material for clothing items which should and must necessarily end their life within a single season.
The T-Shirt Way™ brand is used to promote a new type of shirt that goes beyond traditional cotton t-shirts both in terms of functionality and respect for the environment. It also comes at a very low price and with reduced packaging.T-shirts carrying the T-Shirt Way™ brand will be widely distributed so as to reach traditional hypermarkets and shopping centres but also airports, railways, motorway service stations, post offices, stationers and tobacconists as well as at trade fairs and other events.

<h1>What is Acupressure?</h1>
<p>Over 5,000 years ago the Chinese discovered that pressing certain points on the body relieved pain where it occurred and also benefited parts of the body that were more distant from the pressure point. Everyone, at some point, has used his or her hands to hold tense or painful points on the body (think: temples for headache).</p>
<p>Acupressure is the use of pressure (rather than needles, as used in acupuncture) on intentional points on the body to promote self-healing and reduce pain. There are many scientific studies from sources such as the World Health Organization and National Institute of Health that confirm the benefits of this Traditional Chinese Medicine technique.</p>

<h1> What does “Mudra” Mean?</h1>
<p>You may be familiar with some of the different hand positions used to set intention and focus at the beginning of yoga class - <i>anjali mudra</i> at the heart center or maybe <i>chin mudra</i> during a seated meditation. These gestures are called mudras, which is a Sanskrit word that means “seal.”</p>
<p>While we constantly use our hands throughout the day, in yoga, martial arts and many cultures’ dance traditions, the hands are considered particularly important energetic centers. In fact, in Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine, each finger is associated with specific organs, which helps us to regulate our health.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/949/145/5ea5452846964d9d1d38e0300551c779_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1461205016&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=382e457c498c5b326c60b9b1bcec8249"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>Additionally, the hands have an intimate connection with our brains, both through neural activity and mindful cognition. The way we hold our hands can influence how we guide our minds. This is why yogis have practiced hand mudras. Mudras are the perfect instrument to prepare the mind for meditation, since the mind follows the habits of the body.</p>
<h1>About Kalí Zoë Designs</h1>
<p>Kalí Zoë Designs, founded by sisters Callie and Arianna Spiros, is a jewelry design studio dedicated to holistic and theraputic intentions in wearable design. The studio is a testing ground for ideas they have acquired from diverse education such as The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Tulane University, ISHTA Yoga and Sivananda Yoga.</p>
<p>It was only natural for these sisters to turn this passion project into a company, with the support of their educational institutions, entrepreneurial fellowship (Future Founders of Chicago) and family. They lived and worked on development of Kali Zoe Designs at a yoga ashram and studied meditation and yoga philosophy with global experts in meditation and Eastern philosophy. They also traveled to the Tucson Gem and mineral show to hand select the most amazing stones to decorate your jewelry, and relish every opportunity to learn more about jewelry design and manufacturing from local craftsmen and fine jewelry experts.</p>
<p>Now Chicago-based, Kalí Zoë Designs is excited about the launch of their very first product, the Mudra, here on indiegogo. After indiegogo they will continue to sell the Mudra on their website, and in a wide array of boutiques and stores while developing and manufacturing their next exciting jewelry designs.</p>

It’s Easy.
We wish we could have someone applying pressure to our hands at this point at all times - whether a friend, acupuncturist, massage therapist or ourselves… but hey, that’s not realistic. Use the Mudra for the same effects, wherever you are, whenever you’d like.


It’s Powerful.
Wearing the Mudra reminds you that you hold the power and agency to control your own wellness. It can also serve to alleviate a breadth of symptoms. The World Health Organization released a report that shows acupuncture effectively treats 31 symptoms, diseases and conditions over many studies. Our piece, the Mudra touches on the LI4 point. 
According to acupressure principles, pressure on the LI 4 point alleviates:

headaches and migraines 
mouth and toothaches
carpal tunnel issues 
digestive issues 
stress



It’s a Constant Reminder.
Most jewelry pieces have strong memories attached and are markers of events and time. Create a meaningful marker to honor your body and mind with the Mudra.


What is Acupressure?
Over 5,000 years ago the Chinese discovered that pressing certain points on the body relieved pain where it occurred and also benefited parts of the body that were more distant from the pressure point. Everyone, at some point, has used his or her hands to hold tense or painful points on the body (think: temples for headache).
Acupressure is the use of pressure (rather than needles, as used in acupuncture) on intentional points on the body to promote self-healing and reduce pain. There are many scientific studies from sources such as the World Health Organization and National Institute of Health that confirm the benefits of this Traditional Chinese Medicine technique.


How is the Mudra Made?
We start by hand; we end by hand.


 We sketch out our designs on paper and then model them on the computer. Digital 3D models become wax molds we sand and carve in our studio. Next, we work closely with local casting experts at Creative World Casting to turn a wax model into solid metal. We hand polish each Mudra and manually set each stone. We will also offer the reward of customized Mudras with decorative stones. 


At Kali Zoe Designs we love the process and obsess over every detail. We use ethically-sourced materials, keep production as locally-sourced as possible and choose each of our stones (such as turquoise, moonstone, topaz, garnet, amethyst, jade, hematite, rose quartz, moonstone, malachite, aquamarine, tourmaline, citrine, lapis, and tiger’s eye) by hand. 


We hope you find as much joy in choosing and wearing your own perfect piece(s), as we find joy in making them.

 What does “Mudra” Mean?
You may be familiar with some of the different hand positions used to set intention and focus at the beginning of yoga class - anjali mudra at the heart center or maybe chin mudra during a seated meditation. These gestures are called mudras, which is a Sanskrit word that means “seal.”
While we constantly use our hands throughout the day, in yoga, martial arts and many cultures’ dance traditions, the hands are considered particularly important energetic centers. In fact, in Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine, each finger is associated with specific organs, which helps us to regulate our health.


Additionally, the hands have an intimate connection with our brains, both through neural activity and mindful cognition. The way we hold our hands can influence how we guide our minds. This is why yogis have practiced hand mudras. Mudras are the perfect instrument to prepare the mind for meditation, since the mind follows the habits of the body.
About Kalí Zoë Designs
Kalí Zoë Designs, founded by sisters Callie and Arianna Spiros, is a jewelry design studio dedicated to holistic and theraputic intentions in wearable design. The studio is a testing ground for ideas they have acquired from diverse education such as The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Tulane University, ISHTA Yoga and Sivananda Yoga.
It was only natural for these sisters to turn this passion project into a company, with the support of their educational institutions, entrepreneurial fellowship (Future Founders of Chicago) and family. They lived and worked on development of Kali Zoe Designs at a yoga ashram and studied meditation and yoga philosophy with global experts in meditation and Eastern philosophy. They also traveled to the Tucson Gem and mineral show to hand select the most amazing stones to decorate your jewelry, and relish every opportunity to learn more about jewelry design and manufacturing from local craftsmen and fine jewelry experts.
Now Chicago-based, Kalí Zoë Designs is excited about the launch of their very first product, the Mudra, here on indiegogo. After indiegogo they will continue to sell the Mudra on their website, and in a wide array of boutiques and stores while developing and manufacturing their next exciting jewelry designs.


Thank you family, thank you friends (new and old), thank you mentors, thank you yogis, and thank YOU!
Credits and thank you to John Lawrence Geary for his amazing music skills and to Sara Fisch for her above-and-beyond graphic design skills.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kelly a senior at Missouri State University majoring in Fashion Merchandising. The fashion Merchandising and Design Program at MSU, hosts an annual spring fashion show in April showcasing original designs of the fashion students, featuring the Senior Collection's original 5-7 piece collection. Since 2003, the merchandising students have produced the annual fashion show, but also start with a zero line budget. Through the course of 14 weeks, 32 fashion merchandise student's will work to raise over $10,000 to produce the fashion show. Producing this annual fashion show allows students a real world simulation, utilizing PR, Visual, and Styling skills learned in the classroom, allowing for students to build their portfolio as they approach graduation and secure a successful position in fashion.</p>
<p>This year's theme is Discover 2013. We are asking for your help and support, with your generous contributions the money raised will help support this student endeavor, and allow for the production of this New York rival fashion show. Our hope is to also award the fashion and design students with scholarship opportunities from the monies raised for the event.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The show's budget is $10,000 to produce Discover 2013. For this campaign our goal is $1,000. The $1,000 will go towards expenses such as rental of the facility, runway lighting, DJ, along with other show costs.</p>
<p>As a contributor to the Discover 2013 fashion show you will be awarded many perks based on your contribution. All contributors will receive an advertisement at the show for over 1,000 guests in attendance. Over 1,000 guests in attendance will see your generosity. Other perks include free tickets to the show, free t-shirts, and even priority seating.</p>
<p>The merchandising students at Missouri State are hoping to exceed our $10,000 goal with your help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Exceeding our goal will allow us the opportunity to give back to the students in our department through scholarship opportunities to help them in the future. Over the past 10 years the students have raised just enough money to cover the expenses to produce the fashion show. We would like to change that this year!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand not everyone is able to contribute at this time but if you could help us spread the word to all of your friends and family we would be very appreciative. Please use the Indiegogo share tools to tell everyone about the 2013 Discover fashion show! Thank you again and we really appreciate everyone in this campaign.</p>

<p>Think of the messenger bag as

wouldn't want to wear the same shirt all the time, so why should your bag?
Every time you want to change the look of your bag, simply snap off the lid in
the concealed back pocket and snap on a new one. With just one Muto Bag and a
growing collection of lids your bag can have as many looks as you want!</p>

<h1>Bike Safety Stats</h1>
<p>In 2011, 677 pedalcyclists were killed and an
additional 48,000 were injured in motor vehicle traffic crashes. (Source: NHTSA
- <a href=""http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov</a>)</p>
<p>The most common vehicle involved in
collisions with cyclists is a car or taxi, with the rider usually being hit by
the front of the vehicle. - <b>“In
a quarter of fatal cyclist accidents, the front of the vehicle hit the rear of
the bicycle.” </b>(Source: The Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents – <a href=""http://www.rospa.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.rospa.com</a>)</p>
<h3><b>So
studies show that a cyclist is most likely to be stuck by a car from behind due
to a driver’s inability to see them clearly. </b></h3>
<h1>How does a Muto Interchangeable Bike Safety
Messenger Bag help with this?</h1>
<p>It has a highly visible back lid that is florescent
yellow and orange. Similar to a construction worker’s vest. Time to go to work! </p>

Safety Messenger Bag can greatly increase cyclist visibility, and thereby lessening
the chances of cyclist and vehicle collisions

Use creative art lids to
support unique charitable causes


Develop a community of
creative people that are in love with a bag that changes with them

Detachable Lid ... What's That?

Changing Out Your Muto Lid Is As Easy As Changing Your Shirt

Think of the messenger bag as
your body, and the large frontal flap, or lid as we call it, as your shirt. You
wouldn't want to wear the same shirt all the time, so why should your bag?
Every time you want to change the look of your bag, simply snap off the lid in
the concealed back pocket and snap on a new one. With just one Muto Bag and a
growing collection of lids your bag can have as many looks as you want!

Bike Safety Stats
In 2011, 677 pedalcyclists were killed and an
additional 48,000 were injured in motor vehicle traffic crashes. (Source: NHTSA
- http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov)
The most common vehicle involved in
collisions with cyclists is a car or taxi, with the rider usually being hit by
the front of the vehicle. - “In
a quarter of fatal cyclist accidents, the front of the vehicle hit the rear of
the bicycle.” (Source: The Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents – www.rospa.com)
So
studies show that a cyclist is most likely to be stuck by a car from behind due
to a driver’s inability to see them clearly. 
How does a Muto Interchangeable Bike Safety
Messenger Bag help with this?
It has a highly visible back lid that is florescent
yellow and orange. Similar to a construction worker’s vest. Time to go to work! 



It has a large reflective Slow Moving Vehicle symbol
that will light up when car lights strike it. Much more distinctive and
recognizable than any other reflective material used on other bags.

Artist Bio: Caroline Green is a contemporary self-taught
artist currently residing in the Pacific NW. Green has a love for constantly
exploring new techniques, while continuing to depict a link between irrational
fear and the human body. Her current gallery works (Humanoid) are a combination
of her popular pop silhouettes and modern fauvism with influences from medicine
and inspiration from the human condition. These pieces also express current
world conditions and issues while allowing the viewer to look deeper into their
own psyche. Next upcoming show will be held at The Gallery Zero in Portland
Oregon for the month of October. More information at www.thegalleryzero.com.

<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>My
name is Robert (Bob) Yorke-Hardy. My partner Alana, my wife, and I
are co-owners ofOpal
Resources Canada Inc. Our Company is the <b>only producer of gem
grade precious Opal in Canada. </b>Our son Chris is the one that performs
the magic when it comes to cutting opal and making our jewellery.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opal Resources Canada Inc took over
     ownership of the deposit and the related Okanagan Opal business in 2009.</li>
<li>We have employed others in the past
     and <b>new hiring will occur as the
     business develops and expands. </b>
</li>
<li><b>We are the quintessential small
     Canadian family business.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>First
discovered on Thanksgiving Day October 14, 1991, we have identified a
significant deposit of Opal which we are developing. We will be
celebrating our 22nd Anniversary on October 14th 2013.</p>
<p>We
have brought this business from a grassroots discovery to the stage where a
bright future is in sight.</p>
<p>Given
our exclusive natural
resource ownership position we have a very exciting marketing opportunity; but,
we lack the funds to expand our market outside our present retail shop. We
require financial assistance to take the next steps to full
commercial production.</p>
<p>Our
goal in the Indiegogo campaign is to use the power of the internet to expand
our sales across Canada and beyond to achieve more year-round sales and to
maintain/expand our traditional retail shop sales. </p>
<ul>
<li>As a main step in this
     regard we need to develop on-line sales and to increase finished
     product manufacture (cut gemstones and jewellery) to meet the
     expected increased demand. </li>
<li>We have set ourselves a goal to
     increase sales; particularly through winter months when in-house tourist
     sales are low.</li>
<li>We only recently become aware
     of “crowd funding”; and decided to give it a try. We have chosen Indiegogo
     as our presentation and fund raising platform.</li>
<li>The goal of our Indiegogo
     campaign is to raise funds required to cover the costs of increasing our
     social media presence, conduct search engine optimization and to develop
     on-line sales. This will also require us to ramp up production over
     2013/14 winter months in order to have product inventory to meet this new
     market demand and to provide a base inventory to start our 2014 retail
     sales season. </li>
<li><b>With this goal attained our
     business will grow.</b></li>
</ul>

My
name is Robert (Bob) Yorke-Hardy. My partner Alana, my wife, and I
are co-owners ofOpal
Resources Canada Inc. Our Company is the only producer of gem
grade precious Opal in Canada. Our son Chris is the one that performs
the magic when it comes to cutting opal and making our jewellery.

Opal Resources Canada Inc took over
     ownership of the deposit and the related Okanagan Opal business in 2009.
We have employed others in the past
     and new hiring will occur as the
     business develops and expands. 

We are the quintessential small
     Canadian family business.

First
discovered on Thanksgiving Day October 14, 1991, we have identified a
significant deposit of Opal which we are developing. We will be
celebrating our 22nd Anniversary on October 14th 2013.
We
have brought this business from a grassroots discovery to the stage where a
bright future is in sight.
Given
our exclusive natural
resource ownership position we have a very exciting marketing opportunity; but,
we lack the funds to expand our market outside our present retail shop. We
require financial assistance to take the next steps to full
commercial production.
Our
goal in the Indiegogo campaign is to use the power of the internet to expand
our sales across Canada and beyond to achieve more year-round sales and to
maintain/expand our traditional retail shop sales. 

As a main step in this
     regard we need to develop on-line sales and to increase finished
     product manufacture (cut gemstones and jewellery) to meet the
     expected increased demand. 
We have set ourselves a goal to
     increase sales; particularly through winter months when in-house tourist
     sales are low.
We only recently become aware
     of “crowd funding”; and decided to give it a try. We have chosen Indiegogo
     as our presentation and fund raising platform.
The goal of our Indiegogo
     campaign is to raise funds required to cover the costs of increasing our
     social media presence, conduct search engine optimization and to develop
     on-line sales. This will also require us to ramp up production over
     2013/14 winter months in order to have product inventory to meet this new
     market demand and to provide a base inventory to start our 2014 retail
     sales season. 
With this goal attained our
     business will grow.

What We Need

Our campaign goal is to raise
     $105,000 to fully implement this growth plan.
In addition to meeting
     contribution 'perk' obligations these funds would: 


Firstly, be used to develop and maintain an e-commerce
      marketing program  and social media awareness plan.This will require revision and upgrade of our website
      and the addition of an on-line store on that website and to revise the website making it
      manageable in-house.The targeted funds would fund this effort for the
      first year. We will be enlisting professional consultants to develop and
      implement a diagnostic and e-marketing and search engine optimization
      plan package. 
Further, we will be required
      to develop a product catalog on our website that we can update and manage in-house 

This would include:




Conducting extensive product photography
Prepare
        detailed product descriptions
Regular
        website and e-store updates

Secondly, be used to create inventory from our existing raw material stockpile.

We would:


Cut
        raw opal into gemstones, grade and price
Purchase
        jewellery mountings and finding to produce finished jewellery items
        (earrings, pendants, rings and bracelets)
Set
        jewellery and package for sale/distribution


One thing to remember as you consider
      your contribution to our campaign is that Opal is the birthstone for the
      month of October – this alone represents a very large market; not just in
      Canada but worldwide. We have a sufficient stockpile of raw material
      (rough opal) on hand and a significant reserve at the mine site with
      which to obtain this objective.
What You Will Get For Helping

In return for your support all
     contributors will get a genuine Canadian Opal souvenir complete with a
     certificate of authenticity or an Opal Dig for Two; and higher
     contributions will receive advanced 'perks' their significance being in
     line with your contribution to our campaign – see Perks list below.


Any and all October born
      Canadians (some 8 million individuals) would love to have a Canadian
      Opal be it a simple but unique
      mineral sample or a fancy piece of Okanagan Opal jewellery – in fact any
      October born person worldwide would like this; then there are the opal
      collectors (often referred to as ‘opalholics’)  

Also, contribute in October and
     your name will be entered into our October 2013 draw to win the opal in
     silver pendant shown here and on our Facebook page.
Many 'perks' will be ready and
     delivered in time for Christmas 2013.
Some of our 'Perks' may not be
     created until after funding is obtained so we have set a delivery date of
     February 14, 2014 (Valentines Day) --- we will endeavor to get them to you
     earlier.

The Impact of your Contribution


No contribution is too
     small. Any level of contribution under

     Opal. 
The first funds raised will go
     towards the e-commerce, SEO and SMO project and for meeting 'perks'
     obligations. 
Full funding will allow for
     complete implementation of our plan.

<p>In case you haven't already met, please let me introduce you to the <strong>modern bridal industry</strong>- it's <strong>expensive</strong>, it's <strong>uber-Photoshopped</strong>, and it's <strong>covered in crystals</strong>. You go to some big, shiny store, pick out the nicest dress you can amongst the sea of white poufy-ness, they order it from some factory overseas, you get it 6 months later and then spend another $500+ on alterations. Something here doesn't feel quite right to us.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>We believe in creating a more meaningful experience for women who are getting married or otherwise celebrating life in a fancy dress.</strong></h2>
<h1><strong>OUR VISION</strong></h1>
<p>For years, I've dreamed of a boutique where <strong>old-world atelier service</strong> and<strong> design</strong> would meet <strong>modern demands </strong>and<strong> budgets</strong>. I've also dreamed of a place where fashion does <strong>NOT equal snobbery</strong> and where clothes help make women feel <strong>awesome</strong> about themselves (because women <strong>ARE AWESOME</strong> and should know it). Traditional bridal lines aim to squeeze women into some aspirational character. <strong>We aim to make women look and feel like the very best version of themselves.</strong></p>

<h1><strong>SO, WHAT MAKES SCHONE BRIDAL SPECIAL?</strong></h1>
<p>If you've ever <strong>shopped for a wedding gown</strong> or been shopping with a friend, how many times did you say or hear <strong>""I love this dress, if only ___ was different... Can we do this top with that skirt over there?""</strong> Usually these requests are met more or less with a blank stare. </p>
<p>Now, as a designer, I do the same thing. I'm constantly re-imagining my designs in different versions for different women. So I came up with a <strong>solution</strong>. I've designed an extensive<strong> <a href=""http://www.schonedesign.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">collection of gowns</a> with components that</strong><strong> coordinate with each other.</strong> Within the one collection of about 30 dresses there are <strong>1000's of ways</strong> brides can make her own perfect look, combining skirts, tops, and sleeves (with our guidance, of course!). The design process is always really<strong> fun, interactive, </strong>and<strong> way easier </strong>than it might sound.</p>
<p>On top of all of that, our gowns are made with <strong>high quality fabrics</strong>(such as silks, cottons, French and domestic laces) and are often <strong>more affordable</strong> than traditional bridal gowns. <strong>We handcraft each gown in our Brooklyn studio</strong> using the finest dressmaking  techniques. Since we make them <strong>one at a time</strong>, it's never a problem to incorporate <strong>personal customizations</strong>- actually, we fully embrace and welcome them (love pockets in a gown? Want it in blue? want to cover some regretted tattoo? or show one off? No problem!).</p>

<h1><strong>OUR BUSINESS HISTORY</strong></h1>
<p>I have <strong>over 10 years of experience </strong>in the apparel industry. I have been growing<strong> Schone Bridal</strong> in a deliberate and organic way over the past <strong>3 years</strong>. I started Schone Bridal in <strong>2010</strong>, after the waves of nausea from the 2008 economic crash had finally somewhat subsided, and when the waves of nausea of my first pregnancy just started to hit. Knowing I was going to be a mom soon, so I felt very motivated to really focus in on doing something I could love for the long term and to form a business that one day could support my family.</p>
<p>With only the tiniest amount of startup capital (really only like $200 and some left over fabrics), a very supportive family, and without taking on any debt, I've managed to <a href=""http://www.schonedesign.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>create several collections</strong></a> of really beautiful quality gowns, <strong>employ 3 people</strong> at least part time, have <strong>dressed well over 100 brides</strong>, and have gained fans and clients from all over the world! <strong>All this has taken place out of the room that used to be my livingroom, with my 2 kitties and now 2 year old son running amok</strong>.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">

<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""Our current space is cozy and welcoming...

But we've outgrown it!</div>
<p>SO now we've reached a point where we have a <strong>lease on a commercial storefront space (A LIFE-LONG DREAM!!!)</strong> but we need <strong>YOUR SUPPORT</strong> in order to <strong>open the doors</strong>! The security deposit and realtor fees have been taken care of, and we are <strong>thoroughly confident</strong> in our ability to manage the new monthly expenses. But the space needs some <strong>serious TLC </strong>and<strong> furnishings</strong>, and <strong>that's where all you lovely people come into the picture!</strong></p>
<h1><strong>THE SPACE</strong></h1>
<p>The 725 sq ft storefront space that we have a lease for is located in <strong>Gowanus, Brooklyn (On 3rd Ave at 11th St)</strong>- a previously desolate industrial neighborhood <strong>near Park Slope</strong> which has recently seen the beginnings of a revival. <strong>The bones are great and the RENT IS AWESOME</strong>, but there's some back-breaking work to be done before we can put our pretty dresses and pretty brides and pretty employees in there!</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""Good bones, but needs work :/"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/558/862/9930c53c617574e8983cb0e0723d21f7_large.jpg?1367441022"" src="""" style=""""/>Good bones, but needs work :/</div>
<p>The front of the space will be a <strong>showroom/boutique</strong> area for brides and their families to comfortably view our collection (think pretty ivory gowns hanging amongst sweet vintage furniture and cool-as-heck handmade chandeliers). <strong>We'll also be featuring the Best of the Best from other top Indie Bridal and Accessory designers! </strong>Featured brands will include:<strong> <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/shop/ktjean?ref=shop_sugg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KTJean</a>, <a href=""http://winifredbean.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Winifred Bean</a>, <a href=""http://www.damecouture.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dame Couture</a>, </strong>and<strong> <a href=""http://hushedcommotion.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HushedCommotion</a> (check them out!).</strong></p>
<p>The rear of the space will hold our <strong>design studio with our manufacturing area</strong> (think cutting tables, patterning tables, industrial sewing machines, etc). <strong>All our gowns are made in-house to ensure the highest quality, fast turnaround, and to support the continuation of this craft in the US.</strong></p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""A work in progress, and the satisfying results!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/558/867/9a50ef200e51d040eef7f575645eb1c6_large.jpg?1367441089"" src="""" style=""""/>A work in progress, and the satisfying results!</div>
<h1><strong>THE NUTS-AND-BOLTS OF THE WORK TO BE DONE</strong></h1>
<p>For the <strong>renovations</strong>, first we need to knock out the existing windows and door and create a beautiful <strong>new storefront</strong> (a big plate glass window, a glass-and-steel entry door, security gate). We would love to put in an awning, beautiful bench and some potted greenery to further <strong>spruce up the block</strong> and create a welcoming atmosphere. Next, inside we need to knock down some weird old walls, pull up the icky old floor and subfloor, install a <strong>new subfloor</strong> and some lovely and <strong>sustainable bamboo flooring</strong>. We also will install <strong>new light fixtures</strong> and paint just about every wall/ceiling surface.</p>
<p>We'll be sourcing <strong>vintage and upcycled furnishings</strong> for our showroom. We also need to invest in a few more <strong>industrial machines and upgrade our computers</strong> (um, cause we've been running this entire business so far on <strong>ONE </strong>rather weak and old laptop and it just ain't cutting it anymore!)</p>
<h2><strong>The final result will be a warm, welcoming, thoroughly modern and ""Brooklyn"" space where creativity and craftsmanship will flourish and a sense of community will be nurtured.</strong></h2>

</div></div>","WE HAVE AN ISSUE HERE...
In case you haven't already met, please let me introduce you to the modern bridal industry- it's expensive, it's uber-Photoshopped, and it's covered in crystals. You go to some big, shiny store, pick out the nicest dress you can amongst the sea of white poufy-ness, they order it from some factory overseas, you get it 6 months later and then spend another $500+ on alterations. Something here doesn't feel quite right to us. 
We believe in creating a more meaningful experience for women who are getting married or otherwise celebrating life in a fancy dress.
OUR VISION
For years, I've dreamed of a boutique where old-world atelier service and design would meet modern demands and budgets. I've also dreamed of a place where fashion does NOT equal snobbery and where clothes help make women feel awesome about themselves (because women ARE AWESOME and should know it). Traditional bridal lines aim to squeeze women into some aspirational character. We aim to make women look and feel like the very best version of themselves.

Our 2013 Bridal Collection
SO, WHAT MAKES SCHONE BRIDAL SPECIAL?
If you've ever shopped for a wedding gown or been shopping with a friend, how many times did you say or hear ""I love this dress, if only ___ was different... Can we do this top with that skirt over there?"" Usually these requests are met more or less with a blank stare. 
Now, as a designer, I do the same thing. I'm constantly re-imagining my designs in different versions for different women. So I came up with a solution. I've designed an extensive collection of gowns with components that coordinate with each other. Within the one collection of about 30 dresses there are 1000's of ways brides can make her own perfect look, combining skirts, tops, and sleeves (with our guidance, of course!). The design process is always really fun, interactive, and way easier than it might sound.
On top of all of that, our gowns are made with high quality fabrics(such as silks, cottons, French and domestic laces) and are often more affordable than traditional bridal gowns. We handcraft each gown in our Brooklyn studio using the finest dressmaking  techniques. Since we make them one at a time, it's never a problem to incorporate personal customizations- actually, we fully embrace and welcome them (love pockets in a gown? Want it in blue? want to cover some regretted tattoo? or show one off? No problem!).

Some of our Brides!
OUR BUSINESS HISTORY
I have over 10 years of experience in the apparel industry. I have been growing Schone Bridal in a deliberate and organic way over the past 3 years. I started Schone Bridal in 2010, after the waves of nausea from the 2008 economic crash had finally somewhat subsided, and when the waves of nausea of my first pregnancy just started to hit. Knowing I was going to be a mom soon, so I felt very motivated to really focus in on doing something I could love for the long term and to form a business that one day could support my family.
With only the tiniest amount of startup capital (really only like $200 and some left over fabrics), a very supportive family, and without taking on any debt, I've managed to create several collections of really beautiful quality gowns, employ 3 people at least part time, have dressed well over 100 brides, and have gained fans and clients from all over the world! All this has taken place out of the room that used to be my livingroom, with my 2 kitties and now 2 year old son running amok.

Ahh, so helpful...

Our current space is cozy and welcoming... But we've outgrown it!
SO now we've reached a point where we have a lease on a commercial storefront space (A LIFE-LONG DREAM!!!) but we need YOUR SUPPORT in order to open the doors! The security deposit and realtor fees have been taken care of, and we are thoroughly confident in our ability to manage the new monthly expenses. But the space needs some serious TLC and furnishings, and that's where all you lovely people come into the picture!
THE SPACE
The 725 sq ft storefront space that we have a lease for is located in Gowanus, Brooklyn (On 3rd Ave at 11th St)- a previously desolate industrial neighborhood near Park Slope which has recently seen the beginnings of a revival. The bones are great and the RENT IS AWESOME, but there's some back-breaking work to be done before we can put our pretty dresses and pretty brides and pretty employees in there!

Good bones, but needs work :/
The front of the space will be a showroom/boutique area for brides and their families to comfortably view our collection (think pretty ivory gowns hanging amongst sweet vintage furniture and cool-as-heck handmade chandeliers). We'll also be featuring the Best of the Best from other top Indie Bridal and Accessory designers! Featured brands will include: KTJean, Winifred Bean, Dame Couture, and HushedCommotion (check them out!).
The rear of the space will hold our design studio with our manufacturing area (think cutting tables, patterning tables, industrial sewing machines, etc). All our gowns are made in-house to ensure the highest quality, fast turnaround, and to support the continuation of this craft in the US.

A work in progress, and the satisfying results!
THE NUTS-AND-BOLTS OF THE WORK TO BE DONE
For the renovations, first we need to knock out the existing windows and door and create a beautiful new storefront (a big plate glass window, a glass-and-steel entry door, security gate). We would love to put in an awning, beautiful bench and some potted greenery to further spruce up the block and create a welcoming atmosphere. Next, inside we need to knock down some weird old walls, pull up the icky old floor and subfloor, install a new subfloor and some lovely and sustainable bamboo flooring. We also will install new light fixtures and paint just about every wall/ceiling surface.
We'll be sourcing vintage and upcycled furnishings for our showroom. We also need to invest in a few more industrial machines and upgrade our computers (um, cause we've been running this entire business so far on ONE rather weak and old laptop and it just ain't cutting it anymore!)
The final result will be a warm, welcoming, thoroughly modern and ""Brooklyn"" space where creativity and craftsmanship will flourish and a sense of community will be nurtured.

<p>My name is André Baxter and I am the owner,designer and milliner of Christine Designs by André Millinery, also known as CDA Millinery. Some may not know what millinery is.  However most, at some point in the year, don a hat of some kind for various events. Millinery is the art of hat making. The art of traditional millinery is a fading art. In 2008, after the US economy took a major crash, like so many others, the corporate company I worked for closed it's doors and I found myself unemployed for 2 years. I turned to my creativity and a hobby that I loved, to give me solace and some income. Although I have made hats as a hobby for over 15 years, I have been in the business of millinery the last 6 years. I've been very blessed and fortunate and have made a name for myself in my local market but am now seeking to expand into a broader global market.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<p>""Andre Baxter is a force to be reckoned with within the realm of Millinery and Creativity.  Although we live on opposite sides of the earth, Andre's work goes beyond the idea of a hat and is now a piece of wearable art.  Each piece is beautifully crafted with attention to detail.  Andre fulfills his life with Art, Family and Millinery and it is shown in the final masterpieces.  His work ethic is second to none.  When purchasing a piece of Andre's amazing hats, you are getting more than an item to wear on your head, you are indeed wearing a piece of his Art situated on your head but resting on your heart.  I am so blessed through the medium of cyber space to constantly keep up with Andre's work and watch his business succeed and grow.  I am proud to call him a friend, but more I am so glad to see his Millinery work grow with him as an individual.  You can see his triumphs and happiness with the zest for life through his work.

<p>""Andre Baxter is a talented and passionate milliner who has touched the hearts of many through his extremely warm spirit and continued dedication to his God-given talent. With careful craftsmanship and intricate and thoughtful detail, his work is set apart as he creates one-of-a-kind haute couture pieces that really speak from his heart. Upon meeting Andre, I noticed his huge, but genuine smile and consistent positive energy; which he pours effortlessly into his work. He takes pride in what he does and really believes in his vision. I believe in it as well! I’ve seen him in action and have watched him take his artistry to new heights, dedicating more than just blood, sweat and tears into his collection; which is Vogue worthy, by the way…
As a business colleague and close friend, I will continue to support Andre and wish him well in his efforts to design in his purpose and expand his collection to reach international clientele.""<br/></p>

<p>“There was a time when no self-respecting lady or
gentleman would leave the house without a hat unless it's winter or you have a
penchant for getting stared at in the street.  It's not a terribly 21st century thing to do.
There are occasions where head wear is still considered appropriate, but the
general lack of interest in millinery leaves discerning modern consumers with
few stylish options. I'm proud to announce to some and reestablish to others,
Mr. Andre Baxter, milliner and stylist. Besides his pret' saddle to studio (
ready to wear) collections, Baxter is a steady force within the local Atlanta
and global fashion market. His collection includes bespoke couture hats,
headpieces and cocktail hats. Word of mouth has always been the best way to
build a reputation. Baxter is using this to great success, as his items and
service standards speak for themselves. Kudos to Andre Baxter as he crafts a custom
page in the uncharted territories of the Fashion industry.”<br/></p>

In the last 6 years, we've worked with minimal equipment and supplies. All contributions will go toward the cost for purchasing, steaming equipment, hat blocks, notions, hat body materials, irons and all tools that a seasoned and professional milliner needs in order to produce amazing hats.</p>

""Andre Baxter is a talented and passionate milliner who has touched the hearts of many through his extremely warm spirit and continued dedication to his God-given talent. With careful craftsmanship and intricate and thoughtful detail, his work is set apart as he creates one-of-a-kind haute couture pieces that really speak from his heart. Upon meeting Andre, I noticed his huge, but genuine smile and consistent positive energy; which he pours effortlessly into his work. He takes pride in what he does and really believes in his vision. I believe in it as well! I’ve seen him in action and have watched him take his artistry to new heights, dedicating more than just blood, sweat and tears into his collection; which is Vogue worthy, by the way…
As a business colleague and close friend, I will continue to support Andre and wish him well in his efforts to design in his purpose and expand his collection to reach international clientele.""

“There was a time when no self-respecting lady or
gentleman would leave the house without a hat unless it's winter or you have a
penchant for getting stared at in the street.  It's not a terribly 21st century thing to do.
There are occasions where head wear is still considered appropriate, but the
general lack of interest in millinery leaves discerning modern consumers with
few stylish options. I'm proud to announce to some and reestablish to others,
Mr. Andre Baxter, milliner and stylist. Besides his pret' saddle to studio (
ready to wear) collections, Baxter is a steady force within the local Atlanta
and global fashion market. His collection includes bespoke couture hats,
headpieces and cocktail hats. Word of mouth has always been the best way to
build a reputation. Baxter is using this to great success, as his items and
service standards speak for themselves. Kudos to Andre Baxter as he crafts a custom
page in the uncharted territories of the Fashion industry.”

Up until that moment I was living a life that a lot of people could only dream to have, because every part of it was making me happy and desireful for progress. Before the injury I was working as a tattooist and was practising parkour. Also, I was organising and leading parkour classes.<br/></span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; height: 11pt; direction: ltr; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Arial; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: rgb(62, 69, 76); font-size: 9pt; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);""></span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; direction: ltr; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Arial; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: rgb(62, 69, 76); font-size: 9pt; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);""><i><b>I believe that having a goal, trying to achieve it and enjoying the whole process is the most important thing in life.</b></i></span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; height: 11pt; direction: ltr; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Arial; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: rgb(62, 69, 76); font-size: 9pt; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);""></span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; direction: ltr; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Arial; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: rgb(62, 69, 76); font-size: 9pt; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);"">Before the injury I spent the majority of my time on sports. I had goals I was trying to achieve. One of them was to open a specialised gym for parkour training and physical conditioning training applying movement methods needed to overcome obstacles. In addition to this, I had a goal to break a guinness world record, which I was working on with my friend. The aim of the record was to hold a static exercise called “human scale” for as long as we can. I always was fascinated by the idea of overcoming human’s limitations.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; height: 11pt; direction: ltr; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Arial; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: rgb(62, 69, 76); font-size: 9pt; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);""></span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; direction: ltr; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Arial; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: rgb(62, 69, 76); font-size: 9pt; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);"">After I broke my neck I understood that I will have to start from scratch and relearn everything. My goal was to live independently. I know this objective may seem small, easy and boring when compared with earlier goals. However, only while learning how to sit, how to move myself from the wheelchair into a bed and how to complete other daily tasks, I found out more about my body, its new possibilities. I understood that even as most of my body has been paralysed and range of movement became limited, it has not became easier to reach the limits of my physical body. Nonetheless, getting closer to those limits, although very slowly, admires me as much as before.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; height: 11pt; direction: ltr; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Arial; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: rgb(62, 69, 76); font-size: 9pt; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);""></span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; direction: ltr; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Arial; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: rgb(62, 69, 76); font-size: 9pt; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);"">This summer was very unique. As my lifestyle now is completely different than before, during summer I was able to collect new experiences, try new activities. The aim of this summer was to find a sport, which I would like to practise professionally. After assessing my desires and physical abilities I had a few options. However, immediately after I had a chance to try a racing wheelchair, I understood that it is the sport with which I want to reach my physical limits.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; height: 11pt; direction: ltr; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Arial; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: rgb(62, 69, 76); font-size: 9pt; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);""></span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; direction: ltr; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Arial; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: rgb(62, 69, 76); font-size: 9pt; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);"">To attain the best possible physical shape as I can, nowadays I am training 4-5 hours in rehabilitation hospital and 2-3 hours in a gym, 6 days per week, so that when I will get the needed wheelchair, I could start mastering  the driving technique and begin competing.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; height: 11pt; direction: ltr; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Arial; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: rgb(62, 69, 76); font-size: 9pt; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);""></span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; direction: ltr; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Arial; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: rgb(62, 69, 76); font-size: 9pt; font-weight: bold; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);"">First Obstacle</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; height: 11pt; direction: ltr; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Arial; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: rgb(62, 69, 76); font-size: 9pt; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);""></span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; direction: ltr; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Arial; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: rgb(62, 69, 76); font-size: 9pt; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);"">Unfortunately, in the beginning I did not think that getting a racing wheelchair can be so difficult. It turned out that Lithuanian Sport Federation for disabled can not give me an opportunity to practise wheelchair racing simply because they do not have the needed wheelchair. Also, they are not showing any signs of interest to get one. At this moment I understood that I have to get it myself.

Up until that moment I was living a life that a lot of people could only dream to have, because every part of it was making me happy and desireful for progress. Before the injury I was working as a tattooist and was practising parkour. Also, I was organising and leading parkour classes.I believe that having a goal, trying to achieve it and enjoying the whole process is the most important thing in life.Before the injury I spent the majority of my time on sports. I had goals I was trying to achieve. One of them was to open a specialised gym for parkour training and physical conditioning training applying movement methods needed to overcome obstacles. In addition to this, I had a goal to break a guinness world record, which I was working on with my friend. The aim of the record was to hold a static exercise called “human scale” for as long as we can. I always was fascinated by the idea of overcoming human’s limitations.After I broke my neck I understood that I will have to start from scratch and relearn everything. My goal was to live independently. I know this objective may seem small, easy and boring when compared with earlier goals. However, only while learning how to sit, how to move myself from the wheelchair into a bed and how to complete other daily tasks, I found out more about my body, its new possibilities. I understood that even as most of my body has been paralysed and range of movement became limited, it has not became easier to reach the limits of my physical body. Nonetheless, getting closer to those limits, although very slowly, admires me as much as before.This summer was very unique. As my lifestyle now is completely different than before, during summer I was able to collect new experiences, try new activities. The aim of this summer was to find a sport, which I would like to practise professionally. After assessing my desires and physical abilities I had a few options. However, immediately after I had a chance to try a racing wheelchair, I understood that it is the sport with which I want to reach my physical limits.To attain the best possible physical shape as I can, nowadays I am training 4-5 hours in rehabilitation hospital and 2-3 hours in a gym, 6 days per week, so that when I will get the needed wheelchair, I could start mastering  the driving technique and begin competing.First ObstacleUnfortunately, in the beginning I did not think that getting a racing wheelchair can be so difficult. It turned out that Lithuanian Sport Federation for disabled can not give me an opportunity to practise wheelchair racing simply because they do not have the needed wheelchair. Also, they are not showing any signs of interest to get one. At this moment I understood that I have to get it myself. Sadly, it costs so much, that at the beginning I was not even sure how to do that.Money doesn’t buy happinessIronically, even though money does not buy happiness, which at most cases is definitely a true statement, but at this moment for a full happiness and an opportunity to seek my goals money is exactly what I need. I need them to buy: racing wheelchair($5954), special gloves($179) and rollers($810) for indoor training.http://www.spinlife.com/Invacare-Top-End-Eliminator-OSR-Racer-Racer/spec.cfm?productID=1962#.VF3gbYzFHbWhttp://www.harnessdesigns.com/RacingGloves.htmlObjective - paralympics For most people sports are just a great way to spend their free time, but for me that’s everything. Sports for me are equal to oxygen. Ofcourse, I can hold my breath for a short period of time, but soon after that I am starting to suffocate. Therefore idea that in favour of long and hard training sessions I am going to meet and compete with the world’s strongest sportsmen, pushes me forward.One out of three millionsIt has turned out, that I am the first tetraplegic man in Lithuania trying to get into wheelchair racing. Perhaps that is why everything is so complicated. On the other hand, I really want and hope for this sport to progress throughout the future years.Good example inspiresNeck injuries are one of the most complicated and do have the most serious consequences out there.  This complicates not only the movement, but also everything around. The majority of people who suffered from a spinal cord injury limit their own capabilities as they miss walking way too much. However, put walking aside and opportunities become huge. Therefore, if there is going to be a single person inspired by me, then it definitely would make me really happy.Perks Furthermore, I do have a more artistic side. You can check it here:http://mindaugasbaltuska.deviantart.comThus I have decided to draw something with a computer, print it on canvas and send it to each of one who will support my dream by at least $500.What if I won’t succeed?That is possible, but as long as I will get the needed wheelchair, it is only a matter of time when I am going to achieve the result, which will be a ticket to paralympics. I believe that a receipt for success is simple: belief, passion, hard work.Follow me after it’s doneIf I will reach the needed amount of support, I am inviting you all to follow my progress in my facebook page as well as in YouTube channel, where you are going to see my journey of reaching this goal.Thanks for your time!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

We have listed some vintage watches from our private collection as perks.You will also find some earlier watches that we managed to produce in perks section.Design of Baltic Time Automatic watchDress watch and classic touch are the perfect mixes, make that watch very suitable to be a reminder, put the debate aside, we can all agree that some people can relive the moment and memories just by wearing and looking into the watch, especially those who really knew the story behind the watch. All more reasons to make the classic watch is an area that many people are attracted to. More wanted, means more pricey, that you might end up paying about thousand dollars to own one. We intend to make our timepieces similar to that category, but with a bargain price, so it won’t make your constraints about the budget. What makes this watch so interesting is it has some details and quality along with unique design, you will not usually find at this price point.                                                                          Baltic Time Automatic SpecificationsFrom the inside, watch is powered by Seiko NH35A movement which has hacking function twenty four (24) jewels with an accuracy of -20 to +40 seconds per day(23º± 2ºC) , and a power  reserve of 41 hours.• Functions: Hours, minutes, central seconds, date calendar• Case material: Stainless steel 316 L  • Glass: Sapphire Crystal• Water resistant: 5 ATM  • Movement: Seiko NH35A  • Lug to Lug: 48.5 mm  • Case thickness: 11 mm  • Lug width: 22 mm  • Case diameter: 40.5 mm    • Back case: Transparent mineral glass                                                        Movement SpecificationsManufacturer Seiko Japan Calibres Number NH35A (aka NH35) Antimagnetic DC : ≧ 4800 A / mMovement Type AutomaticJewels 24Vibrations per Hour21,600 bphShock System Dias hockPower Reserve41 hoursDiameter 27.40mm (outside) / 29.36mm (casing)Height 5.32mmFunctions hours, minutes, central second, date calendarAutomatic and manual winding with ball bearing both winding with one way clutch.

With
€1700, we will launch the printed version of our fifth issue. Our
ethos is that of not being tied financially to a commercial brand,
instead rather owing purely to our followers – the people who make
it all happen.</p>
<p>
If
we reach between
€2200 and €3500, we will add 50 limited-edition issues with
supplements that will make it even more special; we will perfect our
packaging, add some trendy stickers and release a special edition
that will include a t-shirt. </p>
<p>
If
we reach €3500, all the money (divided in equal shares) will serve
to pay the designers, writers, and collaborators that have
participated and made possible the creation of the magazine's fifth
issue.</p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">SHIPMENT</b></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>Products' delivery is set for September 30th, 2014.</p><i>Europe (7 -10 days)</i><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><i>Rest of the world (15-18 days)</i></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><i>free shipment includes</i></span></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><br/></b></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">IMPORTANT!</b><br/></p>

supplements that will make it even more special; we will perfect our
packaging, add some trendy stickers and release a special edition

to pay the designers, writers, and collaborators that have
participated and made possible the creation of the magazine's fifth

do) in this project.

Our
goal is to reach €1,700, which will enable us to cover the costs of
the impression and delivery of the 100 issues. With €3500, we will
cover the cost

He now runs the 100m, 200m, and 400m, along with field activities which include throwing the discus, shot put, javelin and the long jump.

</div></div>","AVERY BY WANG started out of designer Annching Wang’s frustration looking for the perfect, button-down shirt – what should’ve been a simple task turned out to be more labouring. With growing conscious values coming at odds with her fashion conscious self, she couldn’t quite figure out why, when our worlds are overbrimming with “stuff”, she couldn’t find a simple, Lauren Bacall-worthy shirt. In a world of too much and too fast, the search for the essential, of the pared down, was the start of a search for freedom through style – and Avery was born as a way to refresh the timeless tailored heritage of the menswear inspired shirt with new values of sustainability, play, and self expression.

THE CONCEPTI am launching a capsule collection that consists of only 4 pieces. It is my response at reframing the world of design, so that we aren’t creating collections of junk and filler pieces, but instead thinking consciously about each individual item so that each is designed with care and heart. I want my clothes to make people look and feel good, using basic pieces to act as the building blocks of a wardrobe that express personal style and values. THE PIECES#1: RICHARD: The classic dress-up, dress-down shirt for everyday. #2: JAMES: A polished version of the perennial tank top. #3: HENRY: In short or long, this is the summer dress that you can layer, take from day to night, and go from casual to sophisticated. #4: ALEXANDER: Inspired by the boyfriend shirt, this is the relaxed, so comfortable it’s like putting on PJs blousey shirt-dress. 

DESIGN DETAILSDesign is a thoughtful process that with clothing requires a blend of artistry and engineering. Some of the details I'm incorporating into the pieces are pockets in dresses, a conscious effort to eliminate extraneous details that serve no purpose (aesthetic or utilitarian), and flattering, tailored cuts. The fabrics used are natural fibres - ranging from crisp 100% organic cotton poplins to organic cotton and hemp blends, to exclusive custom designed prints in cotton-silk. All pieces are manufactured locally in Canada, and are made to order to minimize waste and overstock. 
 
THE ""BLOOM"" PRINT“The light of dawn has secrets to tell you”, a spin-off of the poem by Rumi, is the concept behind the debut collection for AVERY. Inspired by new beginnings, it’s fresh, light, and happy - a conscious act of defiance against an industry that often sells based on feelings of insecurity and false aspiration. “Bloom” is an organic meets digital rendering of a spring/summer floral that is both raw and fluid, with a literal take on the phrase ""the crack of dawn"". This is where one world meets the next, where possibility fills into our lives with energy and beauty. As the first exclusive print designed for AVERY, it is only fitting that it is based on the concept of fresh starts. MISSIONDesign: I believe in living colorfully, and I love to play with ideas and color in my designs. I believe that design must be inspired. And I believe that emotional connection is vital in any act of creation. I treat my work like art that needs to be practical - to me, that intersection between beauty and utility is design. Progress: I’m trying to progress towards a more ethical way of designing and producing fashion - 80% of the fabrics used in the debut collection are sustainable, and all are natural fibres. I print all my exclusively designed custom prints in a process that uses eco-friendly water-based pigment inks on natural fibres with no added chemicals. Timelessness: These are clothes that grow with you, and won’t feel dated in a few years, as I found was the problem with many of the clothes I’ve bought over the years. I am now a firm believer that less is more, allowing people as individuals to form their own personal expression of style through the building blocks of timeless pieces.
WHO IS AVERY?The woman I design for loves life, but maybe her bland or outdated clothes don't show it. Or maybe she loves clothes, but she wants to live more consciously. She might be aiming to step back from fast fashion, and closer to something that aligns with her growing sustainable values, and not just in terms of fabric, but in design as well. And she's sick of eco being beige, unpolished, and seemingly only appropriate for weekend wear or her workout. Maybe she's always complaining about not having anything to wear even though she has a closet full of stuff, or maybe she's feeling her sense of style start to drown with the sheer amount of choice we have out there. AVERY was designed to bridge the gap for these women, between their selves, styles, lifestyles, and values. To be honest, AVERY was designed with me in mind. I am that girl. And I know she might be you too. Or someone you know (if you happen to be of the male gender). 

WHEN DO WE GET TO SEE THE ACTUAL CLOTHES?
I'm currently in the pre-production phase, and am expecting samples to arrive over January and February, with a proposed timeline to finish being mid-February. I urge you to stay connected if what I'm doing piques your interest via Facebook or by joining the email list, as I'll be sending exclusive updates of the collection and campaign as things start becoming more concrete, including sharing photos and videos of the actual samples, as well as the mock-ups for rewards mid-way through the campaign. 

YOUR CONTRIBUTION

I've been saving up to launch this thing ever since I graduated from fashion school, but I know that lack of cash flow especially in the early stages is one of the top reasons businesses fail. Your contribution will help offset the costs of producing this first collection, including sourcing, pre-production and manufacturing costs. I'm saving money by doing all marketing and design myself, and working from my home studio. For the next collection, I am planning a fuller capsule collection of about 8 pieces with 2 exclusive prints, and that will require a larger initial investment, which I am planning for. So I need your help in offsetting the cost of this collection, and to show that there is a need for this kind of vision in the fashion industry. 


Contributions start at $5, and comes with a perk (""reward"") which you can view on the right (and many of them are exclusive to this campaign!), so that I can show you my appreciation for helping me get AVERY off the ground.

<p>This got us thinking, what if the whole structure could transform at will to protect the delicate parts and adapt to various situations and needs? How could we make them them useful also when they are not on your face? Fully flexible and bendable eyewear structure was born, BÆND IT.</p>
<p>We then went a step further: could it be possible to make them modular too? </p>
<p>A revolutionary composite structure was conceptualised so that our eyewear can be separated and recombined in 5 pieces. 3 parts to allow the flexibility and 2 to carry the best lens in the market. After a year of engineering and testing BÆNDIT was finally born.</p>
<p>The modularity allows users to change colours and shapes to best fit your mood and style without having to buy multiple expensive sunglasses and the bendability keeps them right where you need them to be. Bændit, Revolution by Design. </p>

</div></div>","After the success of our first campaign, amazing feedback from our past 8 months of sales and a string of improvements we are ready to bring it up a notch (or two): Meet Al Capone, Red Baron and the Sundance Kid!

Working on Bændit™ technology we developed 3 new metal frames (gold, black and stainless) to work with all of our existing components.  We are launching them here on Indiegogo so you, our early supporters can be the first to get our BANDITS at a super discounted price (up to 40% off retail). 

AL CAPONE EDITION                RED BARON EDITION         SUNDANCE KID EDITION



As Always:
BÆNDIT is MODULAR!



All BÆNDIT pieces are interchangeable and work with ALL BÆNDIT  models. You can swap the colour, mix and match to create your perfect pair of sunglasses. With its Patented structure you can deconstruct them to fit even in the smallest of pockets.
A special 4 and 8 pin handmade alloy attachment, coated with a silicon layer, assures ultra tight and strong fit of the temples and bridge pieces inside the frames.
BÆNDIT is BENDABLE! 
     
BÆNDIT adapts to your lifestyle.  Wear them loose and comfortable until you need to kick it up a notch for that kite surfing or beach volley session, then just press BÆNDIT tight to your face and you are ready for action. BÆNDIT sunglasses will stay where you need them to be. 

This is only possible thanks to our hybrid metal/silicon polymer core moulded together to keep any shape desired.
Multipurpose and multifunctional, useful beyond sun protection!



RED BARON EDITION


Aviator shape brushed gold frames with Gold REVO lens.



Manfred Albrecht Freiherr von Richthofen, also widely known as the Red Baron, was a German fighter pilot with the Imperial German Army Air Service during the First World War. He is considered the ace-of-aces of the war, being officially credited with 80 air combat victories. BÆNDIT in this Aviator`s design remembers the Baron`s mastery, skill and passion for flying in its pioneering age.








SUNDANCE KID EDITION


Round shape black metal frames with Smoke Black lens.
Harry Alonzo Longabaugh, better known as the Sundance Kid, was an outlaw and member of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch in the American Old West. Together with the other members of ""The Wild Bunch"" gang, the Sundance Kid performed the longest string of successful train and bank robberies in American history. BÆNDIT in this shape celebrates the Kid`s nomadic spirit and carefree approach.









 AL CAPONE EDITION
Rectangular shape brushed silver frames with white mirror lens.




Alphonse Gabriel ""Al"" Capone was an American gangster who attained fame during the Prohibition era as the co-founder and boss of the Chicago Outfit. Capone`s mutually profitable relationships with the city's police and the mayor`s office meant that he was safe from law enforcement and politically protected. BÆNDIT in this edition reflects Capone`s entrepreneurial acumen and business vision.

The modularity allows users to change colours and shapes to best fit your mood and style without having to buy multiple expensive sunglasses and the bendability keeps them right where you need them to be. Bændit, Revolution by Design.

<p>My name is Lynthia, and I am the inventor of That Neck Pillow.</p>
<p>Around 2006, I started a business that had me traveling a lot. Even though I visited some beautiful locations such as Barbados, Antigua, the Dominican Republic, San Andres Island, and St. Lucia, I dreaded the long plane rides. After several months of middle seats, non-existent leg room, and a sore neck, I decided to buy a pillow at the airport.</p>
<p>Nothing changed - I had a sore neck and a massive headache. I told myself, “one of these pillows has to work."" So I invested in several different versions of neck pillows. None of them gave me the support and comfort I was looking for. But I still had to travel!</p>
<p>I decided that it was time for me to design a better travel pillow, one that would really help ease the discomfort of traveling. After two years of designing and redesigning. I finally produced my first prototype, and That Neck Pillow was finally a reality.</p>

<p>'This is truly a superior neck pillow.  I got this pillow as a gift and the first time that I used it was when I booked a 5hr economy flight.  I was skeptical at first but I was pleasantly surprised. I had the best neck support that allowed me to sleep all the way to my destination.

<p>'I fly a lot for work and on one of my business trips, I saw a lady with a differently shaped travel pillow.  I was curious about whether it works, and if it does, where did she purchase it. Well, for my next business trip,  I had my own That Neck Pillow. It is the best neck pillow that I have ever owned. It supports my head very comfortably and allows me to sleep through entire flights.

<h2>Perfect For Everyday Wear,</h2>
<h2>Kind To The Environment </h2>
<p>Fewer things say comfort more than a super soft t-shirt. Unfortunately, the average cotton shirt requires 700 gallons of freshwater and tons of pesticides. The apparel industry is the second most polluting industry globally, and we’re here to change that. </p>
<p>Last Bottle Clothing was created to combat the dirty apparel industry one shirt at a time. Our closed loop process utilizes recycled plastic bottles by turning them into super soft, durable t-shirts, perfect for everyday wear. When you’re done loving these shirts, you can return them to be recycled, completing our closed loop process of clothing manufacturing.</p>
<p>We promise an awesome shirt that’s ethically made in the USA and right for everything from hiking and biking, to Super Bowl Sunday, and everything in between.</p>

<p>Last Bottle Clothing makes apparel out of 100% recycled plastic bottles. Our clothing, from the collection of plastic bottles, all the way through the process of turning those bottles into clothing, is all done in the United States by American workers.</p>
<p>Last Bottle Clothing assembled our core group of suppliers and developers within the United States, and all within a small region in the Carolinas, to keep our carbon footprint low. One supplier collects plastic bottles and recycles them into a fine, pellet like substance, while another supplier turns the pellets into a polyester type thread. A third supplier takes the thread and weaves it into reams of usable cloth. Our fourth supplier cuts the cloth into patterns and sews it into t-shirts.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493223002/adpowbkhoqfjyqz04b9p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The result is a pristine product, born and bred in the USA. Every piece of apparel Last Bottle Clothing creates removes an average of 13 plastic 500ml bottles from America’s waste stream, which would otherwise end up in landfills, on the roadside, or floating down waterways heading into our lakes and oceans.</p>
<p>Together with Last Bottle Clothing, you can help reduce plastic waste, decrease your clothing’s carbon footprint and revolutionize the apparel industry in the process.</p>

<p>We started Last Bottle Clothing with a seemingly simple goal: To make sustainable, fashionable clothing entirely from plastic bottles. We wanted our shirts to be soft, durable and perfect for the outdoor enthusiast and book worm, alike. Each of these shirts keeps an average of 13 plastic bottles out of landfills and oceans, so you can be proud to wear one and tell your friends the story behind your tee.</p>
<p>Aside from the shirt itself, we wanted to create an apparel supply chain with a small carbon footprint, and all within the US. Standard apparel travels thousands and thousands of miles before it ends up in stores or at your door, and at Last Bottle Clothing, we're changing that polluting figure. In addition to removing the wasteful nature of transporting clothing between countries, we believe in paying above average and fair wages to our construction teams, all of whom are located within a small radius of the Carolinas. </p>
<p>Traditional clothing lines rely on cotton, an incredibly wasteful crop. <i>Our shirts consume 500 times LESS water than an average cotton shirt, and are softer</i>. The US wastes an enormous amount of plastic everyday, which takes centuries to decompose. We're utilizing this waste and making it into something that's sustainable, cool and looks great. When you're done loving your shirt(s), they can be returned and recycled again, creating a closed loop, entirely sustainable manufacturing process. </p>
<p>We're passionate about the environment and about helping to solve the problem of plastic waste in our country.

<p>Looking for bras that are <strong>comfy, sexy, and healthy</strong> for your breasts? Our bras are made just for you!</p>
<p>To make your breasts ultimately healthy, our bras not only use patented non-toxic removable bra cup with 616 pores, but also have the combination of natural fabric, wire-free, and wide straps for ultimate comfort. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471193181/Description3_x35fsp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>NATURAL FABRIC </h3>
<p>100% cotton in the cups so no toxic chemicals will ever touch your breasts again. Cotton is moisture-wicking and much more breathable than synthetic fibers that are treated heavily with chemicals.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>WIRE-FREE</h3>
<p>Our bras do not have underwires not only for comfort, but also for health reasons. Our wire-free bras are fashionable and beneficial to all types of women, from teens during puberty to elderly, women who experience breast tenderness during menstruation, pregnancy, or breastfeeding, and women with any breast problems. Our bras are suitable for any woman who prefers healthy breasts.</p>

<h3>FOR ALL KINDS OF ACTIVITIES</h3>
<p>Our comfortable and supportive bras can be worn for work, yoga, light exercise, and leisure. We have bras and built-in-bra tank tops that can be worn on both of the inside and outside. They can also be worn for more than 8 hours and worn to sleep to alleviate breast discomfort.</p>

<h3>REMOVABLE BRA CUPS</h3>
<p>Our bras can not only give you enough support and coverage with our bra cups, but can also give you extra room and comfort without the bra cups. Additionally, our bra cups can give you a fuller bust silhouette that looks perfectly natural.</p>
<h3>WIDE STRAPS</h3>
<p>Our straps are about 1-2 inches wide to provide more comfort and prevent redness, soreness, and deep grooves in the shoulder. Wide straps also do not fall easily.</p>

I took some Chinese medicine to get rid of them, but then they recurred several times. So I asked my Chinese doctors how to prevent them. They all told me the same thing: avoid wired bras. I spent a lot of time looking for wire-free bras, but they weren’t as stylish as wired ones until I found these. The bra cups made with non-toxic material is a BIG PLUS for me because I am very health conscious. They also don’t make my breasts sweat as much as a traditional bra does because of the breathability. So I bought 4 so far.<p> </p>
<p>When they say you can wear it for more than 8 hours, they are not kidding. When I had school and a full-time job everyday, I wore the bra for more than 14 hours a day, and I was barely aware that it was even there! They are also not kidding when they say they are much more durable. I machine wash them every week, and they still look like new to me. Also, for me personally, my breast lumps have not come back again for 2 years so far.

ORDER TODAY: WWW.ECETICK.COM
Ecetick is bringing the world's most breathable and comfortable bra to women around the globe. This innovative patented technology has reinvented bra cups and revolutionized bras to free your breasts and give you more confidence. It has the first and only perforated bra cup made with non-toxic and eco-friendly material to enhance breast health and help the environment. It gives you the ultimate comfort, so you might never want to take it off.

Most bras on the market are made with cups that are are made of synthetic polyurethane foam (a petroleum-based product that often ends up in landfills). Did you know how TOXIC and dangerous they can be for your health? Don't let toxic chemicals and carcinogens get near your breasts again. Women deserve better bras.

TECHNOLOGY



 WHY CHOOSE US

Looking for bras that are comfy, sexy, and healthy for your breasts? Our bras are made just for you!
To make your breasts ultimately healthy, our bras not only use patented non-toxic removable bra cup with 616 pores, but also have the combination of natural fabric, wire-free, and wide straps for ultimate comfort. 

NATURAL FABRIC 
100% cotton in the cups so no toxic chemicals will ever touch your breasts again. Cotton is moisture-wicking and much more breathable than synthetic fibers that are treated heavily with chemicals.


WIRE-FREE
Our bras do not have underwires not only for comfort, but also for health reasons. Our wire-free bras are fashionable and beneficial to all types of women, from teens during puberty to elderly, women who experience breast tenderness during menstruation, pregnancy, or breastfeeding, and women with any breast problems. Our bras are suitable for any woman who prefers healthy breasts.

FOR ALL KINDS OF ACTIVITIES
Our comfortable and supportive bras can be worn for work, yoga, light exercise, and leisure. We have bras and built-in-bra tank tops that can be worn on both of the inside and outside. They can also be worn for more than 8 hours and worn to sleep to alleviate breast discomfort.

REMOVABLE BRA CUPS
Our bras can not only give you enough support and coverage with our bra cups, but can also give you extra room and comfort without the bra cups. Additionally, our bra cups can give you a fuller bust silhouette that looks perfectly natural.
WIDE STRAPS
Our straps are about 1-2 inches wide to provide more comfort and prevent redness, soreness, and deep grooves in the shoulder. Wide straps also do not fall easily.
 TESTIMONIALS
Many customers and we ourselves have tested our lingerie over the years, and we promise that we will bring you only the high-quality aesthetic bras that enhance your breast health. Check out what our early customers said.

“I had painful breast lumps for years while wearing wired bras. I took some Chinese medicine to get rid of them, but then they recurred several times. So I asked my Chinese doctors how to prevent them. They all told me the same thing: avoid wired bras. I spent a lot of time looking for wire-free bras, but they weren’t as stylish as wired ones until I found these. The bra cups made with non-toxic material is a BIG PLUS for me because I am very health conscious. They also don’t make my breasts sweat as much as a traditional bra does because of the breathability. So I bought 4 so far. 
When they say you can wear it for more than 8 hours, they are not kidding. When I had school and a full-time job everyday, I wore the bra for more than 14 hours a day, and I was barely aware that it was even there! They are also not kidding when they say they are much more durable. I machine wash them every week, and they still look like new to me. Also, for me personally, my breast lumps have not come back again for 2 years so far. Thank you!” -HL (Read more testimonials here)

The line gives a feeling of relief by eliminating extra costs for alterations or tailoring by focusing on and recognizing correct proportion sizes.  This is done by providing shorter lengths on skirts, leggings, jackets and dresses as well as attention to detail and the comfort it gives the wearer. It is catered to short, petite women of all ages and petite sizes and whose heights are within 4'9"" to 5'4"". The problem with other companies who carry “petite sizes” is that they make their clothes for women who are tall and skinny and these companies did not keep in mind that the average size of women is 5'4"" which is technically 'petite'. Standard American sizes are based on a woman whose height is 5'6"", with Petite Epoque our sizing is based on a short, petite woman who is 5'0"". Hence, Petite Epoque is every short woman's dream line. It recognizes a void in the marketplace for a better fit and size. The line specializes in women's jackets, leggings, skirts, dresses and tops. It hopes to  venture into cocktail and evening wear in the near future. </p><p><b>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</b></p><p>In order to get this line fully off the ground, we need a total of $30,000.  This money will go towards manufacturing costs, marketing, business administration etc.  The minimum we would need to produce 2-3 pieces of the line is $10,000 which is why we are starting out at our minimum amount.  Of course we hope to exceed much more than $10,000 in order to fulfill our goal.  </p><p><b>REWARDS:</b></p><p><b>$5 FOUNDING FAMILY</b></p><p><b>$10 - 10 FASHION TIPS AND TRICKS TO LOOK TALLER: A GUIDE FOR PETITES </b><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464302751/10_FASHION_TIPS_AND_TRICKS_TO_LOOK_TALLER__A_GUIDE_FOR_PETITES_xjcvtb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div><b>$15 ECO FRIENDLY NOTEBOOK WITH PEN</b></div><div>

<div><b>THE IMPACT</b></div>We are making a huge impact in the fashion industry by supporting domestic manufacturing and therefore, all garments are made in the USA.  Supporting domestic manufacturing helps create jobs and keeps money here in the US.  </div>
<div>The petite market impacts the retail business in many ways!  Here's why:  Petite women represent 70% of the female US population.  The average height of a woman is now only 5'4"", which is technically petite.  The petite women market is growing 8.6% annually.  With that said, there are over 600 MILLION petite women in the world!  And lastly, petites represent 10 BILLION of buying power in retail.  This is exactly why this brand is needed today in the fashion industry for petite women to have enclusivity. </div>
<div><b>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</b></div>
<div>Every business has some risks and challenges.  In our case, our biggest problem is obtaining fabrics.  Since we are a small start up company and do not have a lot of capital, we are forced to purchase only low minimum goods.  Therefore, it's very hard to source fabric companies who are willing to work with our small orders.  There are a few out there who do cater to companies like Petite Epoque, however, the fabrics are limited.  Even still, we are able to manage to work with what we can and still present a line with high quality fabrics and great styles.</div>
<div><p>Luckily, I have many contacts in the industry and have made good relationships with fabric vendors and manufacturing companies who believe in the line and  are willing to work with us.</p></div>
<div>In addition, another obstacle is that there are not a lot of petite retailers yet.  Our solution is to start selling online as well as at small boutiques.  Petite women are forced to buy apparel knowing that it will need to be tailored after time of purchase;  I don't know about you, but that is such a hassle.  Not only are you paying for a garment that is probably way over your budget, but on top of that, you will have to pay extra to get the fit you want.  Petite retailers or brands that do carry petite sizes are still not proportioned to a petite woman's body.  Most petite retailers petite sizing is made for a tall, slender woman.  With Petite Epoque we have examined every detail of our garments to make sure that it is tailored to fit a ""REAL"" petite woman.</div>
<div>In conclusion, Petite Epoque hopes to revolutionize the petite fashion industry by opening the doors for petite women all over the world to products that are specifically created to cater to their fashion needs and lifestyle.  It also hopes to gain recognition and prestige in the fashion industry by delivering styles that are liberating for petite women.  It is time for short, petite women to have the looks they deserve!</div>

</div></div>","OUR STORYAs a petite woman myself, I know the struggles that short women face when it comes to shopping for that great pair of pants, dress or top and the extra expense that goes along with getting it fit to your body proportionately.  If I kept all the tailoring receipts for all my garments all these years, I would probably be a millionaire by now.  Petite Epoque was created to give short, petite women all over the world the attention they deserve by creating a line specifically catered to fit proportionately and give fashion looks and trends that are feminine, functional, high quality, transitional and versatile. The line gives a feeling of relief by eliminating extra costs for alterations or tailoring by focusing on and recognizing correct proportion sizes.  This is done by providing shorter lengths on skirts, leggings, jackets and dresses as well as attention to detail and the comfort it gives the wearer. It is catered to short, petite women of all ages and petite sizes and whose heights are within 4'9"" to 5'4"". The problem with other companies who carry “petite sizes” is that they make their clothes for women who are tall and skinny and these companies did not keep in mind that the average size of women is 5'4"" which is technically 'petite'. Standard American sizes are based on a woman whose height is 5'6"", with Petite Epoque our sizing is based on a short, petite woman who is 5'0"". Hence, Petite Epoque is every short woman's dream line. It recognizes a void in the marketplace for a better fit and size. The line specializes in women's jackets, leggings, skirts, dresses and tops. It hopes to  venture into cocktail and evening wear in the near future. WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GETIn order to get this line fully off the ground, we need a total of $30,000.  This money will go towards manufacturing costs, marketing, business administration etc.  The minimum we would need to produce 2-3 pieces of the line is $10,000 which is why we are starting out at our minimum amount.  Of course we hope to exceed much more than $10,000 in order to fulfill our goal.  REWARDS:$5 FOUNDING FAMILY$10 - 10 FASHION TIPS AND TRICKS TO LOOK TALLER: A GUIDE FOR PETITES $15 ECO FRIENDLY NOTEBOOK WITH PEN

<h3>Welcome to my campaign! A Brief Introduction about me, my background and the Company</h3>
<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>I am Darren Mcgonigle a London born entrepreneur, watch enthusiast, collector and founder of the newly formed SWC (Seapro Watch Company) created 2020. I formerly worked within Asset Management in London.  </p>
<p><strong>The 'Vision'</strong></p>
<p>This project evolved from a vision I had back in 2015, of a modern Dive watch that retained all the historical features of a tool watch from the days gone by. I really wanted to bring this watch to life, that is, give it a soul. Sounds crazy right?  Well not for me, all so often I see dive watches and they are just that 'a dive watch'. The SWC MILSPEC NAVY Dive watch, as with all iconic watches, the MILSPEC<strong>©</strong> Navy Diver tells a story one I hope will continue to do so for generations to come.</p>
<p>Roll on 4 years to 2019,  I took the leap and set about researching how to bring this visionary creation to life. 18 months later  the 'Navy ‘Clearance Diver’ watch was born into the MILSPEC brand and is attributed to the elite naval clearance diving units. Units who primarily deal with underwater mine clearance to ordnance operations and are considered to be one of the most respected in the world of diving. When it comes to extreme and challenging environments ‘Clearance Divers’ operate in these conditions with honor and ease and this created our tag line ‘Born to Dive’. </p>

<p>SWC is incorporated in England and has a presence in both London &amp; Geneva; brands include SEAPRO<strong>©</strong> and MILSPEC<strong>©</strong>.  SWC's SEAPRO<strong>©</strong> brand manufactures watchbands for professionals working in extreme and challenging conditions and in 2020 SEAPRO Watch Company became a certified supplier of watchbands to the U.K Ministry of Defence. SWC MILSPEC<strong>©</strong> Navy Diver is our first Dive Watch and is designed by SWC in Geneva, a presence that I will be building upon when developing future MILSPEC<strong>©</strong> models. Learn more about us at <a href=""http://www.seapro.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.seapro.ch</a></p>
<p><strong>Production </strong></p>
<p>Currently SWC will only manufacture a small number of MILSPEC©️ ‘Clearance Diver’. Therefore production numbers will be low during 2021 but manageable and our rewards outlined herein reflect this with limited numbers set. Our pledge is set low, as we are not bound by having or needing to meet a minimal orders as we control our own production cycle and our partners are well established. We have also invested into the project, to ensure that we get the best possible start for the first batch run.</p>
<p><strong>MILSPEC Navy Diver </strong></p>
<p>The MILSPEC<strong>©</strong> Navy diver retains the vintage looks synonymous to the classical dive watches from the 1960’s that we all love.  Applying the orange minute hand, styling the square tipped seconds hand and with the vintage hour markers on the dial, this watch is still truly modern yet vintage. </p>
<p>Modern dive watches are increasingly getting expensive, why? Well, a lot is due to branding and marketing but of course this is of no big surprise to you, as I am sure we all have walked past the authorized watch dealers and had a look. However, it is these two factors that add considerable costs to the retail value not to mention maintenance. </p>
<p>These factors add nothing to enhance the product’s functionality but can create a fear of damaging the watch due to the potential costs of repair. However for dive watches the justification for price maybe a discussion for another day!</p>
<p>So to me this is not just another dive watch offering on some funding platform. My vision is to manufacture a watch that retains all of the quality from modern day luxury sports watches plus functionality to enable the wearer to use the watch for its intended purpose. I truly do believe that a quality dive watch does not need to be expensive to meet the requirements of what one considers today to be 'Luxury' and a functional dive watch and we are here to show our backers what actually can be achieved with the MILSPEC<strong>©</strong> Navy Diver.</p>

Risks & Challenges
We have set ourselves achievable production targets. Although delays can happen across the production cycle, in the event something causes a delay or we foresee this coming, we will keep all backers updated throughout. 
Our partners have been carefully selected - we have partnered with the best companies and manufacturers in all stages of production, packaging and distribution, so we are confident that we are good to go.

 
Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that not everyone will be able to support financially, but there will be some that may still wish to help, and you still can! This Project is not all about raising funds its also about product validation and getting the word out about the MILSPEC Diver and the Brand. The following are just some ways you can still support us, we appreciate ALL the support regardless.

However because of his physical limitations, his choice of clothing was almost non-existent.

Our suits are wool mix with our special stretch fabric.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Flexibility </strong>- A wool fibre can be bent back on itself more than 20,000 times without breaking, compared to about 3,000 times for cotton and 2,000 times for silk.

<h3>What is an Arthesis cover?</h3>
<p>
    An Arthesis cover is a prosthetic cover that wraps around the prosthesis in order to make it look beautiful.
    It is 3D printed and mirrors the shape of the healthy leg. It is built with a special lightweight and yet very durable material.
</p>
<p>
    Each cover is a custom piece that is tailored to fit its owner's prosthesis perfectly.
    Measurements for it are taken over the Internet using a technology called photogrammetry.
    Our clients tell us what they like and we then make a design that matches their taste and
    lifestyle and helps them express themselves in a positive and creative way.
</p>
<p>
    The Arthesis cover is just like a good piece of clothing. If you wear something that looks good
    on you and fits you well you feel awesome. That becomes part of your image and
    changes the way you perceive yourself and how other people see you.
</p>
<p>
    The design on the cover is a powerful self expression tool. You can choose a design that reflects
    your personality similarly to a tattoo. Only it's way better - you can put it on and off in seconds
    and you can get additional designs and change them according to the situation you are in.
</p>

<h3>The story of Arthesis</h3>
<p>
    The story of our company started with a present for a friend, who is a below-the-knee amputee and a
    fitness instructor in the building where we had our 3D printing business. At first we did not know
    he had a prosthesis. When we saw it he said he disliked the way it looked. That got us thinking
    how to use the 3D printers to change that. After a good deal of thinking, several prototypes and
    a ton of excitement, the first Arthesis cover was created! The smile on his face was a powerful
    inspiration for us. It is our ambition to bring the same smile to all the people who have prosthesis. </p><p> However, it turned out that 3D printing is very expensive and instead we found a different way to
    produce the covers that allows us to reduce the price to 150 Euro. We hope that with those lower
    prices we will be able to reach more people and put a smile on their faces, just as we did with our friend.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>A closer look at the Arthesis cover</h3>
<p>Every Arthesis cover consists of two parts - a back panel and a front panel.</p>
<p>
    The back one attaches to the prosthesis using special belts with anti-slip surface.
    They are also very easy to tighten which helps the cover to stay in place during your
    normal everyday activity. If you ever want to go with your bare prosthesis you just
    unstrap the cover. It is as easy as changing clothes.
</p>
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431263830/l4eul8xiogzgmgnve4ez.gif"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<p>
    The front panel is where most of the design magic happens. It attaches to the back panel
    with very strong magnets allowing it to click in place in seconds.
    This smart mechanism allows you to change designs at will.
</p>
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431264438/chrjclh7sb5obvml8x99.gif"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<p>
    Once you get your first Arthesis cover you can get additional front panels that have different design.
    That would allow you to match them with your clothes or the place you are going to. For example wear
    a casual design when you are at work and a more eccentric one when you go out with friends.
</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h3>What types of amputations are supported?</h3>
<p>
    This is our most common question. The answer is all lower limb amputation types!
    Our covers work well with below-the-knee, above-the-knee and hip replacement amputations. 
    All designs are engineered in a way not to interfere with the function of the prosthesis, even if it has an artificial knee. 
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Designs</h3>
<p>The following pictures show our first collection. After you pre-order an Arthesis cover by getting a perk you can choose any of those designs.</p>
<h4>Colors</h4>
<p>With every Arthesis cover, you get to choose your own colors. Solid color changes are included for no additional fee. There is a separate perk that includes more complicated color patterns too. Those are shown further down.</p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>
    We have worked on this project for more than a year. During that period we were able to create several prototypes,
    different solutions to fitting and cover changing mechanisms. We made several designs that have been really well accepted by our fans. 
</p>
<h4>Production</h4>
<p>
    Despite the best planning, there may be factors that we cannot control such as equipment malfunction,
    transport or supplier delays. Depending on the feedback, adjustments to the timeline may be made along the way.
    This will result in a better product but may delay production or shipment in some cases.
</p>
<h4>Shipping</h4>
<p>
    Please note that the FREE shipping <b>does not include any taxes or charges</b>
    you may be incurred on arrival in your country.

    An Arthesis cover is a prosthetic cover that wraps around the prosthesis in order to make it look beautiful.
    It is 3D printed and mirrors the shape of the healthy leg. It is built with a special lightweight and yet very durable material.


    Each cover is a custom piece that is tailored to fit its owner's prosthesis perfectly.
    Measurements for it are taken over the Internet using a technology called photogrammetry.
    Our clients tell us what they like and we then make a design that matches their taste and
    lifestyle and helps them express themselves in a positive and creative way.


    The Arthesis cover is just like a good piece of clothing. If you wear something that looks good
    on you and fits you well you feel awesome. That becomes part of your image and
    changes the way you perceive yourself and how other people see you.


    The design on the cover is a powerful self expression tool. You can choose a design that reflects
    your personality similarly to a tattoo. Only it's way better - you can put it on and off in seconds
    and you can get additional designs and change them according to the situation you are in.





The story of Arthesis

    The story of our company started with a present for a friend, who is a below-the-knee amputee and a
    fitness instructor in the building where we had our 3D printing business. At first we did not know
    he had a prosthesis. When we saw it he said he disliked the way it looked. That got us thinking
    how to use the 3D printers to change that. After a good deal of thinking, several prototypes and
    a ton of excitement, the first Arthesis cover was created! The smile on his face was a powerful
    inspiration for us. It is our ambition to bring the same smile to all the people who have prosthesis.  However, it turned out that 3D printing is very expensive and instead we found a different way to
    produce the covers that allows us to reduce the price to 150 Euro. We hope that with those lower
    prices we will be able to reach more people and put a smile on their faces, just as we did with our friend.


A closer look at the Arthesis cover
Every Arthesis cover consists of two parts - a back panel and a front panel.

    The back one attaches to the prosthesis using special belts with anti-slip surface.
    They are also very easy to tighten which helps the cover to stay in place during your
    normal everyday activity. If you ever want to go with your bare prosthesis you just
    unstrap the cover. It is as easy as changing clothes.





    The front panel is where most of the design magic happens. It attaches to the back panel
    with very strong magnets allowing it to click in place in seconds.
    This smart mechanism allows you to change designs at will.





    Once you get your first Arthesis cover you can get additional front panels that have different design.
    That would allow you to match them with your clothes or the place you are going to. For example wear
    a casual design when you are at work and a more eccentric one when you go out with friends.





What types of amputations are supported?

    This is our most common question. The answer is all lower limb amputation types!
    Our covers work well with below-the-knee, above-the-knee and hip replacement amputations. 
    All designs are engineered in a way not to interfere with the function of the prosthesis, even if it has an artificial knee. 


Designs
The following pictures show our first collection. After you pre-order an Arthesis cover by getting a perk you can choose any of those designs.
Colors
With every Arthesis cover, you get to choose your own colors. Solid color changes are included for no additional fee. There is a separate perk that includes more complicated color patterns too. Those are shown further down.

Predefined men designs










Predefined women designs










Predefined unisex designs










Pattern examples
Those patterns are just examples. You can choose from a large variety once you get a perk. You can also give us a picture you love and we can use it instead.










Custom design examples
Those designs are made with the input from actual customers. We have talked to them about what they like, what they expect and what they envision. Then we have created those so they match their lifestyle and tastes.










Perks for non-amputees

    If you don't need prosthetic cover you can still support us by getting one of the perks. We will give you a 3D printed item.
    We will choose what it will be specifically, but if you have an idea what you want please share it with us.





        Note 1: This picture is just an example
        Note 2: The 3D printed item is the necklace, not the girl

Risks and Challenges

    We have worked on this project for more than a year. During that period we were able to create several prototypes,
    different solutions to fitting and cover changing mechanisms. We made several designs that have been really well accepted by our fans. 

Production

    Despite the best planning, there may be factors that we cannot control such as equipment malfunction,
    transport or supplier delays. Depending on the feedback, adjustments to the timeline may be made along the way.
    This will result in a better product but may delay production or shipment in some cases.

Shipping

    Please note that the FREE shipping does not include any taxes or charges
    you may be incurred on arrival in your country.",30.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p>Now that you've seen most of the fun stuff.  Here's the boring nitty gritty stuff.</p>
<p>Getting this project off the ground requires three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Artwork, imagination and inspiration.</li>
<li>The near magic ability to print vivid, full color graphics on yoga towels.</li>
<li>Our own blank yoga towels to print on </li>
</ol>
<p>In return we'll offer to the world an exciting line of custom yoga towels allowing you to bring your spirit, creativity and personality into every practice.  These towels are perfect for any active person, not just yogis. The towels work great as a compact beach towel, a swim towel, a transition area towel for triathletes, and for everyone else just a beautiful high quality towel perfect for anything they throw at it.</p>
<p>Where We're at:</p>
<p>#1 We already have almost everything nailed down.  We've got artists (we're designers ourselves) and lots of creative inspirational friends and yoga instructor friends to help pitch in with fun designs, patterns and ideas.</p>
<p>#2 We know how to print gorgeous full color graphics into fabric on a smaller surfaces. In order to print something as large as a yoga towel we need new equipment.</p>
<p>#3 We've done the research, choosen our fabric, found a manufacturer and now we just need to find a way to move enough towels quickly to make our large bulk towel purchase feasible.</p>
<p>Your support will help us to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>In the beginning...</p>
<p>To start off, we are going to be offering a rainbow of pre-made designs.  We’ll roll out new designs every week and then start dreaming up some creative ways to allow you to design your own towels.  Below you'll see a screenshot of one of the many batches of custom designs we'll be rolling out soon!  We've already got over 100 designs ready to go.</p>
<p>PLEASE VISIT the Gallery page to see all the designs we have ready to go now.</p>
<p>Initially, we will be offering two sizes of towels, the hand-sized towel and the full mat-sized towel. Both towels are amazingly soft and sweat absorbing microfiber that just happens to be veeeerrry similar to a brand that we’ll just say rhymes with “bonduka.” </p>
<p>Our “Mini Om” hand towel is great for wiping sweat from your face or putting a the top of your mat for a little more grip in downward dog.</p>
<p>Our “Big Om"" full mat-sized towel is great for those really hot and sweaty classes. </p>
<p>Later we’ll be rolling out new fabrics as well, and we’re already doing testing and have some new faves.</p>
<p>Our first batch of towels will be offered with black or white edge stictching (the white is actually really nice as our printing dyes the stitching as well so you get a beautiful edge to edge print).  In the future we plan to add in options for customized thread colors as well to make the towels even more fun.</p>
<h2><strong>How we do it</strong></h2>
<p><img alt=""printing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i46.tinypic.com/ixyx06.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""printing""/></p>
<p>Printing – we use a unique full color process to literally dye the color right into the fabric.  This means that we can print in full color and literally drop a photograph right onto, and actually into, the towel.  This print becomes a part of the towel itself and will never fade or crack and leaves the towel with the same amazingly soft and sweat absorbing powers that it was meant to have.</p>
<p><img alt=""choosing fabrics for yoga towels"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i46.tinypic.com/14b520i.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""yoga towel sample fabrics""/></p>
<p>Towels – We basically looked at the market and said “what towel do people already love?”  Since there’s no “perfect towel,” we decided to start with a soft, absorbent sueded microfiber towel similar Manduka’s Equa towels.  And, as fate would lead, we actually ended up working with the company that produces their unique fabric and sourcing it for our own towels.  For our first round of towels we’ll be using this beautiful, soft and insanely absorbant sueded microfiber.  We’ll soon also be adding in other fabrics as well and have already picked out a super thick, soft and sweat hungry fabric for our next round of towels! </p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">Why I recycle ammunition...</span></h3>
<p>As a fashion designer I have always been keen to use fashion to make the world a better place.  <br/></p>
<p>Recycling ammunition not only brings a positive message to the world by creating something beautiful from something destructive, it brings people together and reminds us that there is always hope.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">I am a Central St Martin's School of Art graduate and New Generation award winner at London Fashion Week with over 10 years of experience as a fashion and print designer in London and Hong Kong. Most recently I have 7 years of experience in working with disadvantaged artisans. </span></p>
<p>On a trip to Cambodia last summer I met the artisans I work with now. Eight months later I launched my first collection.  </p>
<p>On my third trip last month I made the above video. While interviewing Keang and Chantha I realised that they are some the most hard working people that I know. They are an inspiration to me by overcoming adversity with determination and creativity. This is what we are about at Emi &amp;Eve. And this is what emerges from the fire at the foundry.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">The story so far...</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">The video above tells my story and that of the people I work with. I have found that economic empowerment is the most efficient way to help others.  We are not fundraising for freebies. As an artist myself, who has been broke various times in my life, I know that it's much more preferable to be able to afford what I need, rather than being given them.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">I have used my savings to make the first collection and launched it at a boutique. The reaction of everyone who saw the clutches there was fantastic and we sold out pretty fast. As Christmas approaches I need to be ready with new stock and approach more stores, but no longer have capital to invest in the production, and some necessary operational costs. I also have not yet been able to create the packaging and info tags that I have in mind and that the products deserve.

Why I recycle ammunition...
As a fashion designer I have always been keen to use fashion to make the world a better place.  
Recycling ammunition not only brings a positive message to the world by creating something beautiful from something destructive, it brings people together and reminds us that there is always hope.
I am a Central St Martin's School of Art graduate and New Generation award winner at London Fashion Week with over 10 years of experience as a fashion and print designer in London and Hong Kong. Most recently I have 7 years of experience in working with disadvantaged artisans. 
On a trip to Cambodia last summer I met the artisans I work with now. Eight months later I launched my first collection.  
On my third trip last month I made the above video. While interviewing Keang and Chantha I realised that they are some the most hard working people that I know. They are an inspiration to me by overcoming adversity with determination and creativity. This is what we are about at Emi &Eve. And this is what emerges from the fire at the foundry.
The story so far...
The video above tells my story and that of the people I work with. I have found that economic empowerment is the most efficient way to help others.  We are not fundraising for freebies. As an artist myself, who has been broke various times in my life, I know that it's much more preferable to be able to afford what I need, rather than being given them.
I have used my savings to make the first collection and launched it at a boutique. The reaction of everyone who saw the clutches there was fantastic and we sold out pretty fast. As Christmas approaches I need to be ready with new stock and approach more stores, but no longer have capital to invest in the production, and some necessary operational costs. I also have not yet been able to create the packaging and info tags that I have in mind and that the products deserve. The stories of all the people involved and my background are on www.emiandeve.com

But wait....
What if you have loads more orders than you can manage? 
There are other artisans that are ready to take on orders. Our plan is that upon sufficient growth of the business, we will start to work with another artisan in the area who is in need of the work as well. Then from there spread out our network throughout Cambodia. The more production we can do, the more artisans we can work with, the more ammunition gets recycled, the more we can inspire the world with our message of positive transformation! Are you with me? Become an ambassador today!
What if you do not reach your target?
Then we will use the funding we do get to produce the pledges only and seek funding for our operational and packaging needs elsewhere. Every single pledge can be produced no matter what the quantity is.
Will the ammunition not run out?
Unfortunately not. I spent time at the Cambodian Mine Action Centre and they told me it will take another ten years to clear the country. With your pledges, we can perhaps make the time shorter!
Where exactly..... has the ammunition come from?
Ninety pecent of Cambodians are farmers and many find bullet and bomb casings on their land. The ammunition found does not technically belong to anyone. They will pass it to one of the organisations that work to remove the mines or to artists that they know. If you would like to know more about demining, have a look at the work of www.halotrust.org or www.CMAC.gov.kh  on Youtube.
How long will it take to make my order?
Delivery of jewellery rewards will be mid october and clutches early to mid November, in time for Christmas, so think about gifts! During and after the campaign we will provide you with updates on the making of your pledge reward and delivery targets. We want you to feel involved!

More specifically it will help to bring exposure of my art to the community and help to promote the sales of locally made projects.

Your contribution will also help me to provide for my family by not taking the money for supplies and equipment out of my family's budget.

Brace yourself because it is pretty interesting!</p><p>We sell wooden sunglasses. Yes, we just said that. WOODEN sunglasses. Mind = blown! The shades we sell are hand-made from fine exotic woods, offering a look and texture unmatched by other materials.</p>We started when Sagar was on a medical trip in Haiti. While there, he was astonished to learn how many Haitians were afflicted by a preventable eye condition known as Pterygium. To improve the lives of those patients, he decided to find a way to donate sunglasses that will prevent Pterygium.

It causes symptoms of irritation, redness, watery-eyes, and can even impair vision if it becomes severe enough. It’s like having sand in your eyes all day, every day.</p><p>Pterygium is caused by UV-light, wind, and dust - all things that are extremely common in tropical regions such as Haiti. Most patients abroad are given eye drops for this condition, but eyedrops only temporarily treat the symptoms and pterygium remains problematic.</p><p><i>The best approach is prevention!

<p>After returning from Haiti, Sagar and his team went straight to work on hand-crafting prototype wooden glasses. Since those humble days of working in a parking garage, Pterys has come a long way. We have spent the last year perfecting our designs and we are now excited to present 3 frames that are made of Rosewood and Zebrawood. Our frame names are Rose Wayfarer, Zebra Wayfarer, and Rosewood retro. All the frames come standard with polarized lenses, and springed hinges. Oh, and they also float!</p>We are asking you to help fund the manufacturing of our first line of sunglasses. With your help, we hope to raise enough funds to put the final touches on our designs, produce the shades, and deliver them to your beautiful face.

<p><span>The <a href=""http://www.thehopealliance.org/what-we-do/vision-care-and-eyeglasses"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Hope Alliance </a>is a humanitarian organization working in developing countries to empower the people there to create positive and sustainable changes in the lives of their families and their communities.</span></p>
<p>They have a number of project abroad including a special vision program that since 2001 has provided more than 45,000 pairs of glasses to children and adults! In 2012, they started the Pterygium Awareness Project to spread the message “Save your sight, block UV light” and to teach those at risk of Pterygium to wear hats and UV blocking glasses. They believe that <a href=""http://www.thehopealliance.org/what-we-do/vision-care-and-eyeglasses"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">prevention is the only answer to help maintain the vision of tens of millions of people</a>. And they travel several times a year to Haiti, Guatemala and Peru to practice what they preach. </p>
<p>Purchasing a pair of Pterys will help the Pterys community collaborate with The Hope Alliance’s vision program with the goal of preventing pterygium abroad.</p>
<p><span><b>We want to have our cake and eat it too</b></span><br/></p>
<p>At Pterys, we believe that doing good and running a business shouldn’t be mutually exclusive. We aim to create a platform that allows buyers of our stylish and genuine wooden sunglasses to improve eye-health abroad. We are confident that there is no connection stronger than one formed after having a positive impact on an individual's health. It’s karma - what goes around comes around!</p>
<p>While in Haiti, Sagar learned of a Haitian proverb: “Men anpil chay pa lou” - many hands make the load lighter. Though our individual impacts may be small, with your help we hope that together we can make the load lighter for those less fortunate. </p>

What's with the name?Pterys (pronounced “terries”) is named after an eye disease common in tropical areas called pterygium (pronounced “terry-gee-um”). It’s the disease that motivated Sagar to found Pterys. Watch our intro video about it:Who are we anyway?Well, let us tell you. Brace yourself because it is pretty interesting!We sell wooden sunglasses. Yes, we just said that. WOODEN sunglasses. Mind = blown! The shades we sell are hand-made from fine exotic woods, offering a look and texture unmatched by other materials.We started when Sagar was on a medical trip in Haiti. While there, he was astonished to learn how many Haitians were afflicted by a preventable eye condition known as Pterygium. To improve the lives of those patients, he decided to find a way to donate sunglasses that will prevent Pterygium. And Pterys was born!What is this Pterygium thing?Pterygium (pronounced terry-gee-um), also known as “Surfer’s Eye”, is a fleshy growth occurring on the whites of the eye and is much more common than people think. 1 out of 4 adults living in tropical regions actually have it! It causes symptoms of irritation, redness, watery-eyes, and can even impair vision if it becomes severe enough. It’s like having sand in your eyes all day, every day.Pterygium is caused by UV-light, wind, and dust - all things that are extremely common in tropical regions such as Haiti. Most patients abroad are given eye drops for this condition, but eyedrops only temporarily treat the symptoms and pterygium remains problematic.The best approach is prevention! Early use of UV blocking sunglasses helps prevent Pterygium.
Now I’m interested. Tell me more!
After returning from Haiti, Sagar and his team went straight to work on hand-crafting prototype wooden glasses. Since those humble days of working in a parking garage, Pterys has come a long way. We have spent the last year perfecting our designs and we are now excited to present 3 frames that are made of Rosewood and Zebrawood. Our frame names are Rose Wayfarer, Zebra Wayfarer, and Rosewood retro. All the frames come standard with polarized lenses, and springed hinges. Oh, and they also float!We are asking you to help fund the manufacturing of our first line of sunglasses. With your help, we hope to raise enough funds to put the final touches on our designs, produce the shades, and deliver them to your beautiful face. And the best part is, not only will you be one of the first to be rockin’ a pair of Pterys, you will also support The Hope Alliance in the process!
How will Pterys use my money?

Well first of all, we will use it to deliver some awesome wooden sunglasses to your fine face! Pterys is committed to preventing Pterygium abroad. We donate 10% of each and every sale to The Hope Alliance, a non-profit organization working in Haiti, Peru, and Guatemala to provide Pterygium prevention education and protective eyewear.Every time you buy a pair of Pterys, you are investing in the livelihood of person abroad and his or her family. Ptery’s are hand-crafted from wood to provide an environmentally friendly, lightweight, and durable frame for UV-protective lenses. We hope you enjoy your Pterys and spread the word!

Okay…so what do I do now?




Well, you’ve read this far so you must be interested. Your first task is to choose your frame. Can't decide? Well then buy all three! Take a look at the pictures below and you will see the frames we are offering. In case you forgot already, they were Zebra wayfarer, Rose wayfarer, and Rosewood retro. We have set up tiers for contributing so that everyone has a chance to participate.

The Reward levels (perks):

Tell me more about The Hope Alliance



The The Hope Alliance is a humanitarian organization working in developing countries to empower the people there to create positive and sustainable changes in the lives of their families and their communities.
They have a number of project abroad including a special vision program that since 2001 has provided more than 45,000 pairs of glasses to children and adults! In 2012, they started the Pterygium Awareness Project to spread the message “Save your sight, block UV light” and to teach those at risk of Pterygium to wear hats and UV blocking glasses. They believe that prevention is the only answer to help maintain the vision of tens of millions of people. And they travel several times a year to Haiti, Guatemala and Peru to practice what they preach. 
Purchasing a pair of Pterys will help the Pterys community collaborate with The Hope Alliance’s vision program with the goal of preventing pterygium abroad.
We want to have our cake and eat it too
At Pterys, we believe that doing good and running a business shouldn’t be mutually exclusive. We aim to create a platform that allows buyers of our stylish and genuine wooden sunglasses to improve eye-health abroad. We are confident that there is no connection stronger than one formed after having a positive impact on an individual's health. It’s karma - what goes around comes around!
While in Haiti, Sagar learned of a Haitian proverb: “Men anpil chay pa lou” - many hands make the load lighter. Though our individual impacts may be small, with your help we hope that together we can make the load lighter for those less fortunate. 
FAQ

Can I do a story on Pterys or get more info about the company?
Sure! We have been blown away by the support we have received. We don’t spend any money on advertising so the only reason we are here is because of you all spreading the word! We are happy to provide more info. Email us at info@pterys.com.
When will I get my stuff?


The glasses will ship in December. 

How much is shipping?


Free! Well...not actually, but we’ve included the shipping cost in the price of the sunglasses. International shipping costs extra.


I would like know how this is reaching out to the people who actually need it!
Great question! We donate 10% of the revenue from each pair sold to The Hope Alliance. Please see the above information for more details.
What size are your glasses?
Take out your tape measure. Our wayfarer frames are 15.5 x 5 x 15 cm (representing the front of frame, height, and temple length). Our retro frames are 16 x 5.5x 16 cm. They all come with flex hinges that allow the side pieces to go out allowing them to fit every head type.
What kind of lenses do the sunglasses have?
They come standard with polarized lenses (that block UV light).

Opificio V Milano was born in September 2013 in a small italian city between the lake of Como and Milano with the purpose to create great shoes.
We only trust in Italian artisans, specialists that perpetuate a unique tradition, who use the best quality materials, which they cut, work, and sew by hand. Every single object becomes a unique piece and in all its details reveals a centuries-old tradition of craftsmanship and of great attention given to each step.



The selection of materials is the focus point of our collections: We strongly believe that innovation could help us to improve our every day objects. So We choose only the best materials available with one condition: these must be cruelty free. 


Today it is possible to have style, craftsmanship and to be also ethical.
We started this campaign because We need Your help to grow outside Italy, and need some  funds to presents our collections in :
1) America
2) Australia 
3) Asia 
We wanna start from USA, so we need to spend one month or more (if we can) around major cities to show our shoes.  What remains from sales ( - costs of products and Indiegogo's fee) will be used for:

</ul><p> </p></div>","Apollo Litestyle is a customization creative LED-Tecknowledgy company that illuminates your shoes and your style. Our audience are those who appreciate self-expression and a great pair of kicks. We know your shoes are more than just things that protect your feet. They are the foundation of your style. Do you know anyone who’s got true style and wears a bland pair of kicks?

 

We wanted light shoes that fit our own personality and style. We couldn't achieve our goal by manufacturing shoes, so we just modified our own. We lit up our favorite shoes and fell in love. We know you’ll love it too.
Our PURPOSE is to light up YOUR style, celebrate those who are not afraid to strut their stuff, and create the things we love. Empower, express and celebrate your unique style.
We create LED circuits and install them in the bottom of your shoes! The transition is seamless. The circuit is thin enough so you can’t tell that anything was installed, but the LEDs are bright enough to command the attention of an entire room of people. The main components of our LED circuits consist of:

Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs)
CR2032 batteries
Mini Rocker switches
Note: Even if we don't reach our funding goal, you will still get your perks!   This is our passion and we light up shoes everyday.

It’s as easy as 1-2-3...4

Choose your color, pattern, and LED count on our website.

We'll email you a shipping label. Package your shoes in a box, slap the label onto it, and send it to us. 

Your shoes will undergo our LED installation process.

We send your shoes back to you. Turn on your style!

Shipping and handling is included in our service.  As of right now, we only are taking orders and ship within the US. Over the months following the Indiegogo project we will email shipping labels to our supporters. Simply package your shoes in a box and send them to us. We'll handle the rest!

<p>The Wing Maxi was created as a direct result of a problem encountered by its founder: The pain of experiencing accidents every month during monthly menses.

Our goal is to relieve women of a few tasks by delivering The Wing Maxi, along with other comforts, to your doorstep- to simplify your life and bring more delight to every day.

</div>
<p>We present to you VIDI
Watches project. We have designed our first line of watches called Hero. These
are attractive, contemporary and affordable wristwatches, which will contribute
to a complete styling giving it a personal touch. </p>
<p>During our Indiegogo campaign
you can order these watches and be among the first to have them at a much lower
price<span>, than they would cost at retail. </span><span>There is
also a</span> <span>fantastic packaging
which we designed specially for
the VIDI watches. Plus, you have a chance to
get a free Hero watch during our Indiegogo campaign. </span></p>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Do you like original things? </h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>If your answer is yes, then</span> <span>these watches
are right thing for you. Large cases, easy-to-read
numbers, paired with
leather straps, these watches can
be worn on different occasions. The choice is yours. These
watches will certainly not remain
unnoticed on your arm. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We are especially</span> <span>proud of
our Globall</span>™ <span>packaging in which will be placed VIDI watches. This packaging is the result of months of research, and a bunch of sketches searching
for the right design. Our Globall</span>™ <span>packaging seeks to show how ordinary things can be
beautiful. </span></p>

<p></p>

inspired by heroes. According to
what they got their name. Dedicated to all the small

real life, who daily do good and brave
deeds. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>We all have our</span> <span>heroes that we love, respect and admire
them for their work.
That hero can be your friend, neighbor, someone from your family. Or maybe just you. All of us at some
point of our lives want to
be heroes, to do something we'll be proud of. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">These watches will remind you on that.</span></p>

About the project

We present to you VIDI
Watches project. We have designed our first line of watches called Hero. These
are attractive, contemporary and affordable wristwatches, which will contribute
to a complete styling giving it a personal touch. 
During our Indiegogo campaign
you can order these watches and be among the first to have them at a much lower
price, than they would cost at retail. There is
also a fantastic packaging
which we designed specially for
the VIDI watches. Plus, you have a chance to
get a free Hero watch during our Indiegogo campaign. 

Do you like original things? 

If your answer is yes, then these watches
are right thing for you. Large cases, easy-to-read
numbers, paired with
leather straps, these watches can
be worn on different occasions. The choice is yours. These
watches will certainly not remain
unnoticed on your arm. 


We are especially proud of
our Globall™ packaging in which will be placed VIDI watches. This packaging is the result of months of research, and a bunch of sketches searching
for the right design. Our Globall™ packaging seeks to show how ordinary things can be
beautiful. 

VIDI Globall™ packaging
VIDI watches are first available in three different colors: Steel, Gold and Black/Brown. These watches are something that you can use as well for work or everyday life.


VIDI Steel Hero watch


VIDI Gold Hero watch


VIDI Black/Brown Hero watch
That's why we do all this, for people who love and appreciate original things as we do.

Note! The photos in campaign are computer renderings of watches and packaging. These photos show how the Hero watches and Globall™ packaging will look like. 




We need your support!
To launch VIDI
Watches and start production of the watch Hero, we need at least $10000. 
With the funds
we receive, we will be able to follow through the design process until
completion of the product. Any additional funds will be used to help us develop
a new line of VIDI watches. 
So, please help us to reach
our goal. 

  



Why the name Hero for wristwatch? 

This wristwatch is
inspired by heroes. According to
what they got their name. Dedicated to all the small
and big heroes from
real life, who daily do good and brave
deeds. 

We all have our heroes that we love, respect and admire
them for their work.
That hero can be your friend, neighbor, someone from your family. Or maybe just you. All of us at some
point of our lives want to
be heroes, to do something we'll be proud of. These watches will remind you on that.

<div>From the desert of Arizona, I moved to LA when I was 19 and became a fashion designer. I started out by designing for other companies, then I started my own clothing line.

<p>Then something happened. I realized that I was not in control of my destiny. I was not working in a way that made a positive impact in the lives of others and, specifically, those who produced my designs. </p>

<p>I also learned quickly that the typical required measurements of a model in the fashion industry were really unattainable for most women.

So here we are now, we need your support so we can finally launch Hemheist.com properly, make a much needed change in the fashion industry and inspire other corporations to make more conscious decisions with their business models.








We need the support of at least $25,000.00 to help with the following needs:


Produce our first collection of clothing for women of all sizes.

Have a kick a** photo shoot that includes a true representation of the various sizes that real women are. 

Enhance and add some personalization features to our website.

If we don't reach our goal, the funds will at least go to the new all size inclusive photo shoot to get the website as close as possible to showing our true vision.


You can contribute to our journey and receive some beautiful styles made by our fair labor team. All the garments are available in Sizes P, S, M, L, XL, 1X, 2X, 3X, 4X

☆ I am Kai Wolter of Kaiwerx Studio. I'm an artist metalsmith, and I create contemporary jewelry and sculpture. I studied metalsmithing and jewelry at the University of The Arts in Philadelphia and attended Cranbrook Academy of Art for ​a Masters in Metalsmithing.  ☆ Kaiwerx Studio was established in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 2008 for the creation of my hammered biomorphic sculpture. I have been learning and creating in metals for over 25 years. Over these years of study and making, my work has been exhibited internationally, and I have  taught metalsmithing and sculpture.Since graduate school, I have focused on making sculpture, created about and in relation to the body in a large series of hammered, organic abstraction sculptures called Epidermal Planes.Biomorphic Sculpture-Epidermal Planes☆ For the past year, I have worked on a large body of work in sculptural jewelry and developed Kaiwerx Studio’s first contemporary jewelry line:BIOMORPHIC ADORNMENT    Biomorphic Adornment Bold, sensuous, organic, modern primitive statement jewelry For those in search of unique style and personal expression with an appreciation for handcrafted contemporary jewelry.                       ➢ Kaiwerx Studio and the sculpture of Kai Wolter website, www.kaiwerx.com  ➣ Kaiwerx Studio on Instagram page at https://www.instagram.com/kaiwerxwolter/ Design and Natural Motif☆  While a teenager the inspiration for creating began as I fell in love with adornment and jewelry making. With an acquired awareness and appreciation for the qualities of uniqueness and individuality, and an intense desire for working with my hands, I began my search for what is beauty and art.From an empirical analysis of the natural world and a reverence for the beauty of nature, with explorations in the morphology of biological form and an immense passion for making with my hands, I set out to create objects that exemplify the human connection to nature and the expressive spirit.☆ My passion for making evolved from the creative process and the creative problem-solving that comes with making unique objects. The desire to make, is to experience the growth and transformation of material into form. The metamorphosis of raw material into creations that appear to come alive is when the making of objects is the most exhilarating. Imagination of Sensation☆ With the Biomorphic Adornment Line, I am creating sculptural jewelry inspired by nature, that reflect a visual symbiosis with the body. Sculpture for the body with a vitality and sense of wonder. The Biomorphic Adornment line offers designer statement jewelry that merges organic form with contemporary design, for jewelry with a sense of timelessness combined with the sensuous, vitality of nature, for a look that is a unique and personal expression of the wearer.    Biomorphic Adornment- Tendril Collection ☆ Over the last year I created many of the designs that make up the Tendril Collection, the first collection of the Biomorphic Adornment Line. The Tendril Collection explores an abstracted tendril form as a sculptural line that visually corresponds with the body. Sinuous tapered lines or branches wrap around the wrist or the neck. Shimmering, dangling tendrils hang from the ears or a necklace.☆ The Tendril Collection was created in the pursuit of beauty of organic form combined with contemporary design and high craft. With a variety of designs, in all forms of jewelry, ranging from signature pieces such as the Tendril Bracelet and one-of-a-kind statement pieces, the Tendril Collection was created for men and women in search of evocative style and individual expression with an appreciation for handcrafted contemporary jewelry.    The Tendril Collection. Visceral Nature, Sensational Vitality☆ For examples of most of the Tendril Collection see the gallery below the video ☆★ It is now time to take Kaiwerx Studio to the next level.The next stage is to launch the Biomorphic Adornment line and the first collection to the masses.I am excited to introduce Kaiwerx Studio's Biomorphic Adornment: Tendril Collection to the men and women of the world. This is where I am seeking you for your generosity and support. ★
✾Please support Kaiwerx Studio by contributing to the Biomorphic Adornment Line Launch campaign!✾
 Imagination/Techniques/Process/ Craftsmanship☆ The stunning jewelry in this collection are handcrafted in bronze, sterling silver, and brass. With  accoutrements in natural stones, wood, shell, and fossils. The Tendril Collection was inspired by the sensation of the natural world and made by hand from nature.The direct metal techniques used to create these objects are traditional methods of metalsmithing such as hammer forming, forging, and fabrication. My favorite process is hammer forming, therefore much of my work pertains to the transformation of material through forming and forging with hammers.The metals are prepared and patterns cut, then hammered over steel and wood forming stakes and anvils. The hollow-forms created are then joined through welding and soldering. Other materials I incorporate are varied set natural stones such as hematite cabochons and raw crystals, carved wood forms, fossils such as trilobites and ammonites, shell, and sometimes found objects. These additional elements contribute to the dynamic of the sculptural jewelry forms.           The Studio Biz!  -What your generous contributions will be going towards.Kaiwerx, The Art of Kai Wolter☆ Kaiwerx Studio is a one person metalsmithing practice, yearning to grow. In my modest studio in the mountains I have worked long and hard to hone my skills and create designs that I feel are a true expression of my imagination and passion for nature and beauty. And now I want to share this creativity with you. I developed the Biomorphic Adornment line with dreams of beautifying the whole world. I am here now to ask you to support Kaiwerx Studio’s next stage plan, to launch the Biomorphic Adornment line to the world. To do this I am raising funds to market the Kaiwerx brand. These funds would go into establishing and promoting brand identity which would include an advertising campaign, acquiring relationships with sellers and stockists, that would sell and distribute the line, and creating a loyal clientele base with connoisseur's of adornment around the world. Your generous contribution will water the seed and make Kaiwerx Studio grow into a successful creative business. What Kaiwerx Studio Needs & What You Get by donating.☆ Kaiwerx Studio needs to raise $18,750 that will be allocated towards the expenses of moving into the next stage, The launch of the Biomorphic Adornment line with the first collection: The Tendril Collection.Your contribution to this goal will allow me to reach the world fashion market with the Biomorphic Adornment line, promote the Kaiwerx Studio brand identity, by creating an advertising campaign and expand production for a higher sales volume and in return plant the seed to grow Kaiwerx Studio. ❖ The allocation of the $18,750 is as follows: ❖

Marketing expenses include brand identity, packaging, promotion, and advertising. This includes hiring a marketing or sales representative, this expense would include many of the listed expenses in a bundle. For example, the marketing representative would do much of the advertising and promotional responsibilities, etc. The largest allocated portion will go towards marketing expenses.

Business expenses including online store/website (Shopify - e-commerce store/shop) maintenance and upkeep, social networking presence, transaction fees, and other business functions such as photography, packaging and shipping. Also includes, exhibition expenses such as entry and booth fees, transportation and display for trade shows, fairs and trunk shows.

Studio expenses toward production, research, and development in design. This also includes expansion of production facility such as acquiring tools for higher production. Updating and revising equipment and tools, repairing, tuning up, and upgrading.

<p><strong>OUR BRAND</strong></p>
<p>Hi Everyone! </p>
<p>As many of you may know we, Amy Surette and Giana Forgione, started a company called PLATFORM. Our main intention is to open a creative space, primarily for east coast dancers, to have a consistent training environment, explore different styles, and provide them with the correct tools to help influence their overall aesthetic on social media. PLATFORM is more than a space for dancers to develop their creative capacity. We are continuing to incorporate multiple artistic passions of ours into our company/brand, beginning with  “PLATFORM THREADS” our newest clothing line. </p>
<p>To give you all some background, dancers in LA have the opportunity to train in beautiful studios and work directly with a videographer in class to get on camera experience before working professionally on set. They leave class with professionally filmed content that’s specifically branded with the trademark of the facility they train at. Dancers are then able to use quality filmed content to grow their social media platforms. New York has begun similar training styles but lacks some of the newer technologies and advancements such as lighting, special effects, and overall aesthetics. As dancers from the east coast, this is something we always wished we had access to, so it’s our goal to bring it here for the dancers who don’t have the opportunity to go elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></p>
<p>Aside from the training facilities, a lot of LA dancers show up to class wearing something “stylish” and “trendy” with the knowledge that they’ll be on camera. We understand that class is for training and you shouldn’t have to show up in full glam, however, New York is a fashion capital and we want to embrace it through dance. What if we designed clothes built for comfort and practicality that looked good in and out of the studio? Most importantly, what if we designed an all inclusive clothing brand not just for dancers, but for anyone who likes comfort and style?! This is what brings us to introduce you to PLATFORM THREADS - Athleisure Line. </p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Across various industries, companies have had to adapt their operations to comply with social distancing protocols and stay afloat during an economic downturn. These conditions have made it difficult for many existing businesses to survive and even more difficult for new ones to open. We understand that launching a startup is a complicated task in the best of circumstances, and it's an especially complex process to tackle during COVID-19. We had to endure these challenges as we continued to push and market our workshop classes that unfortunately got canceled. We continue to stay on track and remain positive as we work extra hard to bring in the funds we need to give our company the potential it has to flourish, educate the dance community and incorporate a sense of style into comfortable, everyday clothing. </p>
<p><strong>OUR ASK</strong></p>
<p>We have found that in the midst of this chaos, our most practical plan is to launch our clothing line while the world is still adjusting because; (i). More now than ever before, society is taking full advantage of online consuming. (ii) Due to the incline in people working from home, office attire went from traditional workwear to workout clothes. Athleisure quickly became the day-to-night, everyday attire for the average person. It is now that we ask for your consideration in helping us take off. Anything raised will go directly towards our clothing line which will assist in opening our physical space, bringing us closer to our dream. Our clothes will be completely manufactured from scratch. We’ve taken the time to sketch and create great quality, clean, sleek, timeless styles that are both comfortable and reliable. Any donation, no matter the amount, would be deeply appreciated. Your support will mean the world to us and we’ll continue to pay it forward. We hope you believe in us as much as we believe in our company! </p> <p>Love Always,</p>

<h3>Choose Your Adventure. Choose Your Style. All you have to do is FOLD or SWITCH. It’s that simple. </h3>
<p>If you’re like us, you take your life with you when you leave the house. But, most days, you don’t need a full-sized, bulky backpack. URBANATURE by NIID has created the FOLD and SWITCH bags that complement each other and work together to simplify your life. They’re convertible and customizable bags that can be added together, expanded, or used singularly for everyday wear. We like to think of these bags as choose-your-own-adventure packs. You get to determine the storage capacity and style. All you have to do is fold or switch. It’s that simple.</p>

<h3>How To Get Them </h3>

To reclaim a narrative of our own</strong></h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">The Arab region boasts some of the most influential contributions to art and science as we experience them today, from the development of algebra and some of the earliest navigational and geographical charts, to the architectural design of the arcades and the artistry of glassware, ceramics, and textile weaves. But the dominant media narrative all too often forgets this legacy and contributes to a one-dimensional portrayal of what it means to be Arab, which is often conflated with the tropes of war, terrorism, and oppression, set to landscapes of deserts and camels.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">In fact, the Arab world is actually a hub of artistic and entrepreneurial innovations, comprised of the ecclectic sounds of Lebanon's Mashrou Leila and Algeria's Babylone, the visual talent displayed at Jordan's National Gallery of Fine Arts and Beirut Design Week, and the technological innovations of UAE's Souq.com or the broader transportation application, Careem, just to name a few. No matter the sector, the region is full of creatives who are constantly redefining the past and present.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506594715/ldtm281t9gbmdbaffabb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Despite this creative energy, there's a gap between the current generation and the work of its predecessors. The BOSHIES brand is here help us get inspired by everything that surrounds us old and new, as well as to bridge the gap between these worlds, offering an organic fusion of the elements which form our very identities.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>I- WHERE DOES THE BOSHIE COME FROM</strong></h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<strong>1. </strong>An icon of traditional masculinity</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">In 1826, the tarboosh was adopted across the Ottoman Empire. It came as an answer to the banned turban, which was deemed out-dated and unpractical. For over a century after that, the tarboosh spread throughout the Middle-East and North Africa. The universal nature of the tarboosh made it an ideal symbol for an otherwise ecclectic region.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506595139/dw9lk1jseyo9ziepupyk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Prominent high-profile leaders, members of the military, and other powerful social male figures took on the tarboosh as a symbol of pride and influence. Some of these notable people include Egypt's King Farouk and Gamal Abdel Nasser, as well as Lebanon's very own first president, Bechara el Khoury, and former prime minster, Riad el Solh. It was even worn by Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, in the days of his youth.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506595164/ifpq3zq9xtlerwwxvhhv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The post-colonial period (60'S-70'S) brought on a general decline in the wearing of hats as part of daily fashion whether it be in the West or the East. This naturally reflected in the ubiquity of the tarboosh in the Middle East. Today, at least 1 billion inhabitants and 30 countries of this world still have a strong collective culture of the tarboosh.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<strong>2. T</strong>urned into an unisex fashion accessory</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">Fast forward to the summer of 2016, when BOSHIES' founder Elias began re-designing the tarboosh producing the first prototype of the Boshie hat. With the collaboration of local artisans, these hats were carefully handmade, and featured in storefronts across Lebanon.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506595549/m4ckvdrry7rtkashqa8q.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">After the first Boshie hat's initial success, Elias and his team of artisans reinvented the tarboosh yet again, creating a winter Boshie hat, handcrafted out of wool. They then set out to gather feedback from the Lebanese market about his products, taking a look at sales records, customer reactions, and market trends.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506595590/gqavdw7wfckomdvhvlso.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">With this new information in mind, they decided the Boshie hat's design could be made even better. So in 2017, joined by Boshies' new partner designer Diane, the team set to work on a new model for the Boshie hat.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506595609/geaqytkoylskkrjghl2u.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The new design maintains the familiar shape of the tarboosh, with added elements like a rounded top and more defined borders for protection against the sun. The two hand-stitched strands on either side also serve as a throwback to the original tassels of the traditional tarboosh. The Boshie hat now comes in a variety of colors.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506595834/f1awvihs3nefofmpyrqw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">This new modernized Boshie hat has broken free the tarboosh from its macho identity, easy to wear by anyone from all around the world, including both men and women, old and young, Middle Eastern and non-Middle Eastern.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506595854/yv9bhpxedgikizdjecot.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">III- HOW DID THE BOSHIE HAT COME TO LIFE ?</h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<strong>2. </strong>Expert local craftsmanship</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">Lebanese artisans were once key to the region's art scene, creating some of its richest cultural artifacts. Today, these items are reduced to stereotypical Arab souvenirs. Artisans now, more than ever, are struggling to keep their craft alive and make ends meet. To change that, it was important to bring these figures back into the creative process. BOSHIES hopes to keep on producing not only hats, but inspiring artifacts and clothing based on Arabic heritage, all while utilizing local craftman's expert savoir faire and artistry.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506595994/cevklypvjmpa9f7ms7zr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<strong>2. A</strong>nd the finest international techniques</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">While the Boshie hat's origins are Lebanese, it was important to create the best possible version of the design. Searching for the most innovative techniques to create the perfect balance between authenticity and quality, Elias and Diane travelled to Bologna, Italy. There, they met up with renowned headwear expert Dana Jaker, who taught them everything she knew about finest techniques in creating hats, using top of the line tools and equipment along the way. Mixing these international techniques with local craftsmanship will truly allow BOSHIES to create a hat of the highest quality.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506596142/wycxlcrgjlfbppykdlkk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who is Dana ?</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">With over 30 years of experience designing and shooting her own millinery labels, Dana Virginia Jauker is the go-to expert on quality hat creation. Her work is housed in some of the most exclusive stores in major fashion capitals, including Italy, London, Tokyo, and New York. Her designs have been featured in runway shows and in collections of fashion powerhouses like Romeo Gigli, Yohji Yamamato, Eric Tibush, Collection Privée, Daniela Bizzi, Giorgio Brat, and Borsalino. She also launched her own haute couture line in 2009 called Yesey.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">3.

To elevate Middle Eastern culture, with styleToday, Arabs are not only losing touch with their cultural roots, but their voices are also getting lost in the global media climate. What better medium than fashion to help this generation tell its own story? BOSHIES is a modern Lebanese clothing brand that aims to reflect the diversity and spirit of the region, helping shift the conversation to a more positive note. By creating fashion pieces inspired by the Middle Eastern culture, BOSHIES is not only helping modernize Arab culture, but it also hopes to spread this culture accross the world.To start with, we decided to put a contemporary spin on one of the staples of Middle Eastern clothing with the Boshie Hat: Our modern incarnation of the tarboosh can now be enjoyed by Middle Easterners and non-Middle Easterners alike. By mixing the talent of local artisans with unrivalled international techniques, we're helping to reimagine the collective Arab story. THE HAT 1. BURGUNDY x Black stripes2. BEIGE x White stripes3.

To reclaim a narrative of our ownThe Arab region boasts some of the most influential contributions to art and science as we experience them today, from the development of algebra and some of the earliest navigational and geographical charts, to the architectural design of the arcades and the artistry of glassware, ceramics, and textile weaves. But the dominant media narrative all too often forgets this legacy and contributes to a one-dimensional portrayal of what it means to be Arab, which is often conflated with the tropes of war, terrorism, and oppression, set to landscapes of deserts and camels.In fact, the Arab world is actually a hub of artistic and entrepreneurial innovations, comprised of the ecclectic sounds of Lebanon's Mashrou Leila and Algeria's Babylone, the visual talent displayed at Jordan's National Gallery of Fine Arts and Beirut Design Week, and the technological innovations of UAE's Souq.com or the broader transportation application, Careem, just to name a few. No matter the sector, the region is full of creatives who are constantly redefining the past and present.Despite this creative energy, there's a gap between the current generation and the work of its predecessors. The BOSHIES brand is here help us get inspired by everything that surrounds us old and new, as well as to bridge the gap between these worlds, offering an organic fusion of the elements which form our very identities.I- WHERE DOES THE BOSHIE COME FROM
1. An icon of traditional masculinityIn 1826, the tarboosh was adopted across the Ottoman Empire. It came as an answer to the banned turban, which was deemed out-dated and unpractical. For over a century after that, the tarboosh spread throughout the Middle-East and North Africa. The universal nature of the tarboosh made it an ideal symbol for an otherwise ecclectic region.Prominent high-profile leaders, members of the military, and other powerful social male figures took on the tarboosh as a symbol of pride and influence. Some of these notable people include Egypt's King Farouk and Gamal Abdel Nasser, as well as Lebanon's very own first president, Bechara el Khoury, and former prime minster, Riad el Solh. It was even worn by Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, in the days of his youth.The post-colonial period (60'S-70'S) brought on a general decline in the wearing of hats as part of daily fashion whether it be in the West or the East. This naturally reflected in the ubiquity of the tarboosh in the Middle East. Today, at least 1 billion inhabitants and 30 countries of this world still have a strong collective culture of the tarboosh.
2. Turned into an unisex fashion accessoryFast forward to the summer of 2016, when BOSHIES' founder Elias began re-designing the tarboosh producing the first prototype of the Boshie hat. With the collaboration of local artisans, these hats were carefully handmade, and featured in storefronts across Lebanon.After the first Boshie hat's initial success, Elias and his team of artisans reinvented the tarboosh yet again, creating a winter Boshie hat, handcrafted out of wool. They then set out to gather feedback from the Lebanese market about his products, taking a look at sales records, customer reactions, and market trends.With this new information in mind, they decided the Boshie hat's design could be made even better. So in 2017, joined by Boshies' new partner designer Diane, the team set to work on a new model for the Boshie hat.The new design maintains the familiar shape of the tarboosh, with added elements like a rounded top and more defined borders for protection against the sun. The two hand-stitched strands on either side also serve as a throwback to the original tassels of the traditional tarboosh. The Boshie hat now comes in a variety of colors.This new modernized Boshie hat has broken free the tarboosh from its macho identity, easy to wear by anyone from all around the world, including both men and women, old and young, Middle Eastern and non-Middle Eastern. III- HOW DID THE BOSHIE HAT COME TO LIFE ?
2. Expert local craftsmanshipLebanese artisans were once key to the region's art scene, creating some of its richest cultural artifacts. Today, these items are reduced to stereotypical Arab souvenirs. Artisans now, more than ever, are struggling to keep their craft alive and make ends meet. To change that, it was important to bring these figures back into the creative process. BOSHIES hopes to keep on producing not only hats, but inspiring artifacts and clothing based on Arabic heritage, all while utilizing local craftman's expert savoir faire and artistry.
2. And the finest international techniquesWhile the Boshie hat's origins are Lebanese, it was important to create the best possible version of the design. Searching for the most innovative techniques to create the perfect balance between authenticity and quality, Elias and Diane travelled to Bologna, Italy. There, they met up with renowned headwear expert Dana Jaker, who taught them everything she knew about finest techniques in creating hats, using top of the line tools and equipment along the way. Mixing these international techniques with local craftsmanship will truly allow BOSHIES to create a hat of the highest quality.Who is Dana ?With over 30 years of experience designing and shooting her own millinery labels, Dana Virginia Jauker is the go-to expert on quality hat creation. Her work is housed in some of the most exclusive stores in major fashion capitals, including Italy, London, Tokyo, and New York. Her designs have been featured in runway shows and in collections of fashion powerhouses like Romeo Gigli, Yohji Yamamato, Eric Tibush, Collection Privée, Daniela Bizzi, Giorgio Brat, and Borsalino. She also launched her own haute couture line in 2009 called Yesey.3. The application of a meticulous production processTaking what was learned from the seasoned headwear expert, the Boshie hat was created using the highest quality felt fabric. The material took on a bell shape, followed by molding using an expert block technique. Steam was then applied to the fabric, which allowed it to take the shape of the mold. After drying, two strands were carefully handstitched on either sides of the hat. IV- THE TEAMWho is Elias? Elias El Haddad is the founder and brand creator of BOSHIES.

Words can't express how grateful we are for every person who supported us, for every dollar invested in our company, for every feedback sent to us, for every belief and every word from our supporters and backers! They say: 'When you see a successful business, you must know that someone one day made a courageous decision"" - and we believe in this. Our courageous decision was to launch our little baby-company on Kickstarter and wait for people's feedback... We received it and we are so proud and full of desire to move forward creating more and more new products! Dear customers, dear backers, YOU are our driving force, thank you for motivating us to work harder, to think bigger and to create more! And here is a little surprise: for those who did not get a chance to back out project, we are launching INDIEGOGO - IN - DEMAND for only 15 days to give you a chance to check out footwear out!100% wool breathable thermoregulating footwear for ALL SEASONS.  Water resistant.  Odor resistant. No sweating, no cold feet.  Footwear Perfected.  Thank you for visiting our page. Being a couple of women that wear all types of shoes, we found that we were always faced with a choice between comfort and style: the good-looking shoes hurt our feet and the comfortable shoes looked like, well, comfortable shoes.We decided to create our own line of footwear that looks great, fits perfectly and is ethically sound. The result of our efforts is Wools - footwear that benefits from one of nature's most amazing material. Our brand was created for people who want to look stylish but do not want to sacrifice comfort. Whether you are running errands, attending an event or sitting through meetings, our footwear will help you accomplish what you planned for the day. WOOLS footwear brings together: design, fashion, function and being a voice for animals. Made of 100% wool with rubber soles, Wools footwear is made with simplicity, durability and comfort in mind. During the felting process, the natural woolen fibers shrink and entangle very tightly and firmly, making the shoes perfectly insulated and form fitting. These strong, natural fibers regulate temperature, keeping your feet warm without overheating in milder temperatures.Wools footwear is designed to allow you to accomplish your things without ever worrying about the comfort and look of your shoes, while fulfilling a higher cause.Your feet deserve the right shoes, shoes that look great, last for ages and fit perfectly. This has been the driving force behind WOOLS. When creating and developing our footwear, we wanted to bring people an ethically sourced shoe that would be durable and able to regulate temperature in any weather condition.   We were inspired by pressed wool as the material that would check all the boxes because wool is a true masterpiece of nature. Here is why:Sizing length measured from feet (inside the shoe) lengthWomens:Mens: This smart lace up shoe suits any formal occasion, from a high-powered board meeting to an evening event.

<p>Antonia Saint Dunbar creates solutions for women and others who need them, and most often, products that are in industries dominated by men with minimal innovation. For her first company THINX, she led the design and wrote the patent for the period-proof underwear while also doing all operations of the company as COO for many years.</p></figure></div>

<p>THINX went on to be named TIME Magazine's “Top 25 Best Inventions for 2015,” Entrepreneur Magazine's “Top 100 Most Brilliant Companies of 2016” and Fast Company's “Top 50 Most Innovative Companies in the World of 2017.” THINX also makes activewear, reusable tampon applicators and organic tampons, and every product comes with a giveback that empowers girls around the world. Her second company, Icon, makes products for incontinence and helps fund the Fistula Foundation.</p></figure></div>
<p>The idea for Antonia Saint NY came when walking to the THINX HQ in New York City and feeling pain in her feet. Similar to when she was working on creating THINX, it was her father’s DNA as an industrial designer that came alive inside of her.</p>
<p>Called a “Feminist Genius” by the press and nominated to Women 2.0’s “Top Founders to Watch,” Antonia is now focused on the women's shoe industry to create products that address both form, and function. She also Co-Founded The Brooklyn Shoe Factory to have a home for the custom-fit orders she will create in the U.S., with a focus to grow jobs as the company scales.</p>

<p>Board-certified Podiatric Surgeon Dr. Suzanne Levine is the official advisor to Antonia Saint NY, and one of the Most Influential Podiatrists of 2017 by Podiatry Magazine. She is a highly-regarded instructor, Co-Chair of the International Aesthetic Foot Society (iafs.com) and Co-Founder of Institute Beauté.</p></figure></div>

<p>A self-proclaimed shoe addict, Dr. Levine was inspired by her elite and celebrity-driven clientele to provide a solution for the ongoing effects that come from wearing the designer stilettos we all dream about. After creating several inventions of her own to address high heel pain and other types of shoe problems, she tackled the root of the issue, the shoe itself, and partnered with Antonia Saint Dunbar for Antonia Saint NY. </p></figure></div>
<p>This is a fitting role for Dr. Levine, as the aristocrats of Manhattan commonly refer to her as the ‘Podiatrist in High Heels’ and she has been a candid supporter and a passionate advocate of women not having to sacrifice optimal foot health for the sake of their undeniable sense of fashion.</p>
<p>As a leading expert and author at the forefront of podiatry with a revolutionary resolve to “provide pain-free beauty,” she has become a favorite on various shows including Good Morning America, The Dr. Oz Show and The Today Show. Over her career of 30 years, Dr. Levine has seen more than 200,000 patients, and she has gained tremendous peer recognition as one of the most internationally acclaimed podiatrists in the industry.</p>

But most of the time, these hurt. At Antonia Saint NY, we believe that you should have beautiful shoes that make you feel great. That’s why we make essential heels and flats that look classic on the outside, and feel like sneakers on the inside.    Created to be a gorgeous, classic shape to complement absolutely anything in your closet, our shoes softly hug your feet with a hidden SoftSurround System™ so that you feel supreme cushion with each step.Instead of sacrificing beauty for wearability, or accepting the pain of beautiful shoes, we have carefully re-engineered high heels and flats to give you the high-quality support you deserve. 
Every well-loved shoe starts with finding the perfect fit. To provide you with shoes that are more personalized to fit you, we have a smartphone app that will help you create a Fit Profile™ and Sole Story™ to save your measurements and find your closest matching shoe. Once we get this info, our team will carefully customize your shoes to fit *you.*We are offering this customized service to all Indiegogo backers as a thank you for helping us get started!
 
 
At Antonia Saint NY, we believe that you should no longer be held back by something as simple as your footwear. If you’re going to fulfill your dreams, you can’t have part of your brain focused on the pain that you feel. You can’t break a glass ceiling with a glass slipper - and we’ve got lots of glass-breaking to do! - so it’s high time to Free the Feminine and Her Feet. 
 

 
 
 
 
We have created a truly modern shoe for the modern world. We have thought of all the ways in which we wished flats and heels would feel, and how we wished they would wear over time, and we spent the last two years bringing them to life.  
We have a patented SoftSurround System™ to gently cushion and support the entire foot. 
Made up of three distinct parts listed below, we also created these shoes to be some of the most durable you’ll ever own.
 
*Our Essential Flat comes with the same technology, with slight modifications.Everyone needs an essential black heel and an essential black flat in their closet. They go with everything and make anything look great. It’s like having that perfect little black dress, but for your feet.For those of you who want to ease back into wearing heels on occasion, or simply love flats, the flat is an absolute game-changer. And for those of you who must have that go-to heel, we’ve got what you need. The heel stands at 3.5 inches, but feels MUCH LOWER due to the triple-cushion insert design, and overall technology.  
Imagine wearing your favorite running shoes...
It feels fantastic. The combination of the plush interior that surrounds you, and the soft, flexible materials used throughout, makes this the most cushioned classic shoe you’ve ever experienced.
  
  
  
   
Finally, you can have a high heel that supports you in moving through life instead of just looking pretty. You now have three shoes built into one: Instead of wearing one pair to work, one pair at work, and one pair after work, feel confident you can make it through the entire day and night with one pair of beautiful shoes if you want to. You can: 
Don’t just listen to us. Hear from a few of those who have actually tried our shoes.

 

 
 
 

Making shoes that fit *you* requires some extra thought and care, but you’re worth it. You are unique, and there are no other two feet exactly like yours. 
Think about it: Does one of your shoes pinch more than the other? Or does one shoe move on your foot? Or worse, even fall off when you walk? 
With our split shoebox that arrives to you as a complete set, you can receive the perfect size for each individual foot. No other shoe company is doing this, and we’re proud to be the first.

Take a look at how other shoes perform over time in comparison to Antonia Saint NY.

 

Check out what you can save when you buy these well-made shoes. There's an old saying ""buy cheap, and buy twice"" and we know that to be true.  

 

Hate to say it, but you need to know (in case you haven’t figured it out yet) - the industry is a RACKET. Too often we fall for beautiful shoes that only hurt us. One study found that we have BILLIONS of dollars of unworn shoes sitting in our closets because of how painful they are known to be after just a few uses.

The idea for Antonia Saint NY came when walking to the THINX HQ in New York City and feeling pain in her feet. Similar to when she was working on creating THINX, it was her father’s DNA as an industrial designer that came alive inside of her.
Called a “Feminist Genius” by the press and nominated to Women 2.0’s “Top Founders to Watch,” Antonia is now focused on the women's shoe industry to create products that address both form, and function. She also Co-Founded The Brooklyn Shoe Factory to have a home for the custom-fit orders she will create in the U.S., with a focus to grow jobs as the company scales.

Board-certified Podiatric Surgeon Dr. Suzanne Levine is the official advisor to Antonia Saint NY, and one of the Most Influential Podiatrists of 2017 by Podiatry Magazine. She is a highly-regarded instructor, Co-Chair of the International Aesthetic Foot Society (iafs.com) and Co-Founder of Institute Beauté.

A self-proclaimed shoe addict, Dr. Levine was inspired by her elite and celebrity-driven clientele to provide a solution for the ongoing effects that come from wearing the designer stilettos we all dream about. After creating several inventions of her own to address high heel pain and other types of shoe problems, she tackled the root of the issue, the shoe itself, and partnered with Antonia Saint Dunbar for Antonia Saint NY. 
This is a fitting role for Dr. Levine, as the aristocrats of Manhattan commonly refer to her as the ‘Podiatrist in High Heels’ and she has been a candid supporter and a passionate advocate of women not having to sacrifice optimal foot health for the sake of their undeniable sense of fashion.
As a leading expert and author at the forefront of podiatry with a revolutionary resolve to “provide pain-free beauty,” she has become a favorite on various shows including Good Morning America, The Dr. Oz Show and The Today Show. Over her career of 30 years, Dr. Levine has seen more than 200,000 patients, and she has gained tremendous peer recognition as one of the most internationally acclaimed podiatrists in the industry.

We are incredibly fortunate to have a team of more than 25 people working with us to help bring this dream to life for all of you. We have the expertise of production partners, consultants and shoemakers, and here is the team who works in New York City every week with Co-Founders Antonia Saint Dunbar and Obed Moses Cepeda.

 

We will be using these funds to create our first production orders of shoes, including all the tooling, molds and components that these complex designs need across many sizes! The more money we raise, the more we can make for all of you! 
We will also be helping to create more jobs in America with all custom-fit orders being fulfilled in our Brooklyn Shoe Factory, so thank you so much for helping this dream come true for us, and for everyone who would benefit from shoes like this!",60.0,3,"1 Campaign

<br/><h2>Our Story:</h2>
<p>Darion Cortez is an luxury accessories brand that plans to be the most interactive and consumer friendly luxury brand in the world. Founded in 2010 by Darion Cortez a self-taught artist from St. Louis, Mo. the concept of the brand started as a favor for a friend. Darion was approached by a close friend who at the time worked in a clothing store whose manager was looking for an original pair of shoes to use as a display. This friend knowing Darion was an artist decided to ask him if he'd be up to handle the task. Having been in a rut with art for a while he jumped at the chance to try it as he saw it as a new and fun challenge as well as an opportunity to try a new form of art. Darion was supposed to show one shoe concept but instead showed twelve. After presenting his designs to his friend Darion decided to stick with shoe designing and over the next few years started to develop his own style. Since shoe designing was an art form he'd never tried before he looked to Louboutin, Giuseppe Zanotti, Ruthie Davis, and Nicholas Kirkwood for inspiration on how to design beautiful shoes. In 2015 Darion decided to expand his creativity and started to branch out into designing other accessories such as jewelry, handbags, backpacks, and sunglasses. Now in 2016 with your help he's ready to begin the process to launch his brand in the Autumn/Winter 17/18 season. <br/></p>

You are not satisfied with the options out there for your funky esthetic and demand for quality and simplicity. We heard your prayers and answered...here’s what we came up with!</p><p>We created a durable cork based shoe that takes all this into consideration. The result is the tsouls shoe wearing lifestyle.  From One To Many, is our motto.</p><p>When your mood or outfit changes, so can your shoe. Your worldly travels will take on a new level of comfort when you just need to take one shoe that meets all your needs.  Transformed easily by peeling off your top and attaching a new one. Have fun with changeable tops while being seriously comfortable, stylish and equally responsible to the earth. Let's take a look at what makes this unique concept interesting for those who care about such things as style and being eco-conscious at the same time.</p><p>YOU ASK:  Why Change-able tops?</p><p>BECAUSE:  this concept allows you to have many different looks with just one shoe.  Minimizing the amount of shoes for your many outfits. Wear tsouls when you travel and pack only the tops in our customized sole bag….so no shoes to pack!  But you’ve still packed many shoes. THAT’S THE WHOLE IDEA! The storage space in your closet will happily get some extra room because it will not be taken up by tons of unworn shoes.</p><p>YOU ASK:  So what’s the quality like?  I’m tired of cheap, plastic shoes that hurt my feet.</p><p>WE DELIVER:  We use the highest quality cork and infuse it with natural latex. Then, we cover it with chrome-free leather and insert heel springs, for that extra bounce in your step. No plastic! We Promise.</p><p>YOU ASK: What’s so eco-friendly about it?</p><p>IT IS: Our 3RE recycling program to benefit you, me and the cork tree.  It goes something like this:</p><p>1 &gt; YOU REturn - your love-worn soles back to us</p><p>2 &gt; WE REcycle - those old soles for new ones</p><p>3 &gt; YOU RElive - your newborn soles at cost value</p><p>Hey, shocking news!  9 out of 10 shoes will find themselves in shoe landfills that are growing and growing!  We feel we cannot contribute to such waste so we encourage all our wearers to return their old shoes back to us and we will recycle them.  In return, we will sell you a new base shoe at cost value.
