<p>Hi! My name is Brooke and as a former child welfare case manager I have seen first hand what families go through when they enter the Dependency Court process.  It is confusing, embarrassing and frustrating.  Something has to change!  A part of the process is visitation with the parents and children, which can be difficult due to a shortage in personnel who can monitor the visits, availability of a room to hold the visits and also the lack of time available.  Most parents work and cannot make it to visitation between 9-5, so they lose their opportunity to see their kids.This has a devastating effect on the children who are already angry and confused about what is happening. </p>

<h3>How Camp Cheesecake Came to Be.</h3><p><span></span><br/></p><p>I'm Tami Cabrera, founder of the <a href=""http://muddypawscheesecake.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Muddy Paws Cheesecake Co</a> in St Louis Park, MN. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1366918/files/20150408163331-MPC_LOGO_copy.jpg?1428536011"" src="""" style=""""/></p> I grew up making and eating perfect cheesecake in the Chicago area. When I moved to Minnesota in 1991, I couldn't find cheesecake. I started bringing cheesecake into work and people kept asking me to make more. I left my job and put all of my savings on one large full page ad (talk about risky!). It worked! Over 20 years later, I'm still doing what I love: making people smile with cheesecake. We make over <b>222 flavors of cheesecake</b> including gluten free and vegan options. We make cheesecake the old fashioned way: using whole ingredients, carefully monitored baking, and in small batches. We use many local ingredients and free range farm ingredients. We serve weddings, corporations, the general public, mail orders, fundraisers and restaurants. We also give a large portion back to the community in the way of donations and events we put on. We are actively involved in many Minnesota charities.<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>I am also a proud single mom to 4 incredible children. </i></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1366920/files/20150408163416-family.jpg?1428536056"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>Now it's<b> time to give our little bakery new wings</b> er um wheels. It's time for <b>Camp Cheesecake</b>! SO many people say <i>""I wish you were closer!""</i> Or <i>""How can I get your cheesecake by me?"". </i> We love connecting with community and Camp Cheesecake gives us even more ability to <b>share our creamy delicious cheesecake.</b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1366977/files/20150408165318-dulce.jpg?1428537198"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b><div style=""text-align: right;""><b> We can't wait to hit the streets of the Twin Cities with it! </b></div></b><div>
<br/><p>The extra cool thing about Camp Cheesecake is that because our products will be pre-packaged, we will be licensed to go just about anywhere (kind of like an ice cream truck)! We will come to your wedding, business, after school activities, sports games, street, driveway, private party, fundraiser, church and so many other activities. Cheesecake is a America's favorite treat! And our cheesecake food truck is the first of it's kind, it's <b>CHEESECAKE on WHEELS</b>! We will even have camping chairs available plus hooks bolted on the camper for your dog so you have two hands free to eat cheesecake. We'll offer 10 rotating cheesecake flavors daily including vegan and gluten free options.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Funding this
project will make this all happen! I<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">f all goes to plan for the first year, we plan to </span>roll out several more Camp Cheesecakes across the midwest next year!<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> AND of course, </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">giving back</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to the community will be a running theme thru it ALL.

</div></div>","How Camp Cheesecake Came to Be.I'm Tami Cabrera, founder of the Muddy Paws Cheesecake Co in St Louis Park, MN.  I grew up making and eating perfect cheesecake in the Chicago area. When I moved to Minnesota in 1991, I couldn't find cheesecake. I started bringing cheesecake into work and people kept asking me to make more. I left my job and put all of my savings on one large full page ad (talk about risky!). It worked! Over 20 years later, I'm still doing what I love: making people smile with cheesecake. We make over 222 flavors of cheesecake including gluten free and vegan options. We make cheesecake the old fashioned way: using whole ingredients, carefully monitored baking, and in small batches. We use many local ingredients and free range farm ingredients. We serve weddings, corporations, the general public, mail orders, fundraisers and restaurants. We also give a large portion back to the community in the way of donations and events we put on. We are actively involved in many Minnesota charities.I am also a proud single mom to 4 incredible children. Now it's time to give our little bakery new wings er um wheels. It's time for Camp Cheesecake! SO many people say ""I wish you were closer!"" Or ""How can I get your cheesecake by me?"".  We love connecting with community and Camp Cheesecake gives us even more ability to share our creamy delicious cheesecake. We can't wait to hit the streets of the Twin Cities with it! 
The extra cool thing about Camp Cheesecake is that because our products will be pre-packaged, we will be licensed to go just about anywhere (kind of like an ice cream truck)! We will come to your wedding, business, after school activities, sports games, street, driveway, private party, fundraiser, church and so many other activities. Cheesecake is a America's favorite treat! And our cheesecake food truck is the first of it's kind, it's CHEESECAKE on WHEELS! We will even have camping chairs available plus hooks bolted on the camper for your dog so you have two hands free to eat cheesecake. We'll offer 10 rotating cheesecake flavors daily including vegan and gluten free options.
Funding this
project will make this all happen! If all goes to plan for the first year, we plan to roll out several more Camp Cheesecakes across the midwest next year! AND of course, giving back to the community will be a running theme thru it ALL. Cheesecake makes the world go round!
Where Does the Money Go?
Money will go to pay off the camper and for a vehicle (used) to
pull it, the individual city licenses, incorporation and trademark fees, storage, an official office, insurance, music installation, build out, refrigeration equipment and staffing.  We will also have branding and
marketing expenses, green serve ware to purchase, and transportation expenses. And of course we cool perks for those who donate! (Like a monthly tasting club, a flask, and VIP seating status ON the camper!) And EVERYONE who donates will be invited to our LAUNCH PARTY! One day we'd also really love a brick n' mortar location to park our campers and build out a Camp Cheesecake Cafe at. But for now: we just need to roll out ONE! Can you help? A cheesecake food truck? It doesn't get any better!
THANK YOU SO MUCH for coming to our page and for donating. Please share share share using the Indiegogo tools. Tell your company about it too - they'll be listed on our website, we'll shout them out online often and we'll bring Camp Cheesecake there (if in the Twin Cities)! Post on Facebook and Twitter. Tell everyone you know. I can't do this without your help!

$10,000 - 3rd Edition Production & Marketing Expenses $25,000 -  Event Vehicle/Mobile Office.  I will sell my FJ Cruiser 4X4 and get a used utility vehicle.  I'll be living and working out of this vehicle for a large portion of the next couple of years, the size I need will cost upwards of $25-30,000 plus taxes and licences (slightly used - it must be reliable).  So, with my truck sale and some help from all of you, I'll have a home/office on wheels, this way I'll be able to be out on Colorado's backroads finishing the book, bringing in fresh content, photos, and updates, and covering events for you $50,000 - RBC Website Development.  This is a large chunk, it's a fairly complex concept to put together, technically speaking.  My media team will do most of the work, but we will also need to hire out some of the html code writing.  With building and testing plus launch costs, it simply adds up to a lot of very expensive labor hours. $40,000 – Business startup/Overhead/Operating Expenses (first year)  This will include business licencing fees, account set ups, monthly software licencing fees, Cell, internet, and cloud storage backup costs.  There is also photography and video supplies and equipment upkeep, vehicle insurance, gasoline, and maintenance to pay for.  Lots of miscellaneous stuff too like basic office supplies and business cards.   $8,400 – Rent and utilities for one year.  I will be moving out of my condo, I have a room arranged for cheaper, and will put most of my belongings in storage.  If I need to go without a ""home"" for a while, that's fine, that's what it takes.  I did it for the first edition, I camped out every night and bathed in backcountry streams to eliminate lodging costs.  Because you all are so awesome and generous, I want to cut costs as much as possible, so now I will gladly do it again for the third edition.$20,000- Personal Expenses  Since it is necessary to go part-time at my workplace, I'll have to start paying for health insurance.  My current vehicle is paid for but I do have a very small credit card payment, I should be able to cover those things with part-time work.  That leaves food, clothing, and personal hygiene supplies for a year. $13,806 –The price tag for Phase 1 is $153,400, a 9% Indiegogo fee would amount to $13,806, which explains the $168,000 figure.



Campaign Summary
$168,000 is needed to launch  Phase 1Ultimately, the revenues created will sustain the endeavors of this project.  We will also be looking for additional financing to quickly expand our capabilities.  This is why our campaign goal is $250,000, we want to create a complete experience for our members and guests.  My 3rd edition is only a few months from submission to my publisher, that is, if I am allowed the necessary time away from my job, and the website can follow right along if you will please help now.  If you feel our goal is too much at once, then please allow us the first phase and we will show you what we can do.

Mobile Route Building ToolImagine having route information from my guide at your fingertips.  Mobile integration with our website will allow cyclists to string biking road segments together to create unique routes with detailed documentation, color photos, maps, and profiles.  Cyclists will be able to share their unique journeys with others in the community, including photos and comments of their ride.
Phase  2 will involve creating and marketing our mobile app, website, and book together as one.  Getting the word out to the community  will be integral to our growth. Accomplishing Phase 1 will give us a great starting  placed for something really special. I know that you and others who get  involved will want to continue playing a special part in this worthwhile journey.



Your Impact on Road Biking Colorado
The truly  comprehensive nature of my book has spawned emails from people all over the world  thanking me for creating such an invaluable guide.  Time and time again I am told how my book has  helped them discover the most amazing rides of their lives, or how it lives on their  nightstand, or in their car's glove box.


  I cannot overstate how  important your help is to the future success of Road Biking Colorado. Help me pursue this opportunity and complete my  life's work.  My dream to share  Colorado’s incredible cycling destinations began over three decades ago. There are  currently no one-stop shop resources for Coloradans and the millions of vacationing  cyclists coming to visit each year. Together we can change that!",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My story is as follows: <br/></p>
<p>Emotional Disclaimer, it contains love, heart break, death, grief &amp; resurrection.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Coming from a large family I was always the nurturer of four siblings.<br/></p>
<p>I was an independent person that led a full and 
active life from the challenges of adolescence and my early 20's.  When I
 met the Love of my many lives Paul, my life changed for
 the better when we had our first child Sebastian. We were overjoyed 
with love at this amazing soul that we created.  Becoming a mother to 
my first born was the most beautiful and heart-warming experience and I 
felt that a new lease in life at creating an
 abundant and fulfilling life for myself and my family.</p>
<p>Life was fantastic, my beautiful boy was growing up
 fast, he had the most charming sense of humour and had a smile that 
made you fall in love with him at first sight.</p>
<p>The name Sebastian has latin origins and means: venerable and revered. He certainly ""accorded a great deal of respect"" and was cherished beyond imagination<i>.</i> <i><span></span></i></p>
<p>Our beautiful family life took an unexpected turn 
when we found out when Sebastian was 3.5 that he had an inoperable, 
incurable brain tumour. The doctors gave him 3-6 months to
 live.</p>
<p>The devastation that followed was immense and intense on our beautiful family. This healthy, gorgeous little boys time on this planet was coming to an 
end. The angel who gave me a reason for living and taught me so much 
about self worth was going to be lucky
 to reach his fourth birthday.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>There was nothing we could do. No medical 
intervention was available to us.  Despite our attempts at various 
alternative therapies we were forced to watch our son leave us behind. 
</p>
<p>My heart was broken. Sebastian died on August 10th 2009, in my arms in our lounge room at <span>9:47AM</span>.</p>
<p>At the time I was 12 weeks pregnant with our second
 son. The grief was overwhelming but we held it together for our unborn 
baby. As the nurturer in my family I knew I had to hold
 it together for everyone. If I allowed myself to let go succumb to  the
 sadness and despair I was afraid I’d never return.
</p>
<p>I went through the cycles of grief, anger, guilt 
and shame.  As a result I felt it necessary to punish myself, for not 
being able to save my son through means of self sabotage,
 self loathing, guilt and emotionally cutting myself off from love.  The
 opposite of everything that Sebastian had taught me.  I was no longer 
honouring myself or my family.</p>
<p>We had our second baby boy in March 2010, this was a
 bittersweet occasion which fluctuated from joyous occasionally was 
racked with despair, and my inability to find happiness in
 being a mother again. </p>
<p>I choose to return to full time work in Animal Welfare 
whilst Paul became a full time stay at home parent. We made this 
decision together as a coping mechanism because I could not bring
 myself to do this.  I could not allow myself to fail at being a mother 
again. 
</p>
<p>Ptolemy was my distraction baby, he distracted me 
from what had happened and allowed me to function through life despite 
feeling hollow and robotic.</p>
<p>I worked long hours in a very emotionally 
challenging management position 7 settled on being an after hours 
mother.  This enabled me to ignore the growing void within me.</p>
<p>In 2012, I had another boy, Gabriel.  At first I 
planned a short leave from work but the universe decided I needed to 
stop. The universe can be quite strong in sending a message,
 particularly since I nearly died a few weeks after giving birth from a 
blood clot.
</p>
<p>I choose to take time out from the pressure and 
punishment I had accumulated upon myself and it was time to enjoy life 
again and being a mother!
</p>
<p>Gabriel was my healing baby. He brought joy back 
into my life, a sense of self-worth and love. I was able to fully step 
into my role as a mother again.</p>
<p>As my journey evolved a number of further life 
changing events occurred.  My management employment ceased which was a 
blessing in disguise.  I donated a kidney to save my sister. 
 My health deteriorated again &amp; I had a break down.</p>
<p>I also nearly lost my husband and boys, the most vital part of my healing.</p>
<p>I did seek help and in the process I met some beautiful and awe inspiring sisters.</p>
I found my tribe and FINALLY I decided to follow my true path and passion.<br/>What is my true Path and Passion: I became Caring Cook, The Vegan Food Alchemist.<br/>
<p>Since I can remember I have always loved to cook, bake, make and create delicious food. Food that can be enjoyed by everyone that is healthy, hearty &amp; nourishing.</p>
<p>From a typical western background of food consumption to an awakening of consciousness to a vegan lifestyle I am now exploring the  depth of potentials of raw food,I am passionate about creating sumptuous,
healthy, vitality producing vegan food and sharing  this to the world .</p>
<p> I incorporate into my food, truth, integrity, compassion &amp; a little bit of magic to create delicious
and nourishing foods for body, mind &amp; spirit.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Caring Cook is about how easy it is to maintain a
healthy vegan diet for all the family and embodying the true nature of the
spirit of non-violence towards all sentient beings and a healthy planet. Never has there been a
time in human history when it is more important to tread lightly on the planet
and I can help show you how. </p>
<p>A plant based diet is not only good for the environment
but also is about empowering and embodying the highest spiritual principles of
compassion, empathy, love and vitality.</p>
<p>I am now ready to take the leap in running my own Cafe where my skills and passion for healthy food can be enjoyed by a far greater audience. <br/></p>
<p>I have gained much experience of cuisine from all over the world and have traveled to a number of countries including Thailand, Cambodia, Bali, China and The United States to learn the art of Vegan &amp; Raw foods. Which compliments my current studies in Nutritional Medicine.<br/></p>
<p>Sebastian's Place will be a cafe of Nourishment, Love and Healing. <br/></p>
<p>A safe place where people can gather for healthy meals, connect with like minded people, learn the culinary skills of vegan &amp; raw cooking, seek holistic counseling , energy healing and grief / trauma support. </p>
<p>A place to reconnect to people, to food, and to oneself!<br/></p>

A safe place where people can gather for healthy meals, connect with like minded people, learn the culinary skills of vegan & raw cooking, seek holistic counseling , energy healing and grief / trauma support. 
A place to reconnect to people, to food, and to oneself!
What We Need & What You Get Here is a breakdown of what we need to get this going!
*Business Purchase
* Signage & Marketing
* Fit out & set up
*Kitchen upgrade, including new oven, fridge, freezer
*Furniture for both eating area and healing room, comfy couches & bean bags
*Massage table
*Cold Press Juicers
*Sandwich Press 
*Commercial Dish washer
*Wall hangings
* Two months rent to help get us started
* Water Filter
* Water Dispenser
Our goal is to raise $90,000 as this would cover the above and get things rolling nice and quickly. The sooner I can get in the kitchen and start cooking, the sooner I can contribute to healing this earths inhabitants!
My amazing husband Paul is a Holistic counselor and will be utilizing the healing space to work his magic allowing us to work side by side and compliment each others passions and talents. And also provide the very best advice, care and support for those in need!If there's anything that we have learned from the loss of a child, our precious Sebastian, it is how important love and support of others is. If we can give back and support others in a time of need or provide a safe space for anyone that is looking, then this traumatic, emotional bumping journey we have been riding for the past 6 years will give us the opportunity of healing we never thought imaginable!Ahh the risks, well life is a big fat risk! I have a background in Practice management, customer service, meeting monthly expectations and turning $70k annual profits into $350k annual profits in just two years. And this was just doing a job, not the job that I was passionate and was an extension of me job, just a 9 - 5 job that paid my bills.( I've also in between ""jobs"" worked in hospitality since I was 15, many beautiful moons ago)I have worked for others most of my life and the short stint I had at owning my own business, that was starting to be successful within a very short period of time, 8 months, I gave up due to Sebastian's illness.I have a 20 year background in business management and if I can run other peoples business's successfully then look out world because I will nurture and love my very own only as a great mother can!From the start I will have a sound business plan and have strategies in place to conquer everything and all challenges that come my way! And if I cant, I will seek out those who can! So, what can you do? Help by contributing to such an awesome campaign! Simple, check out the perks to see whats available! Spread the word, make noise oh and I have to remind you to use Indiegogo share tools!!Plus, please come and visit Sebastian's Place, you seriously wont be disappointed!!Sebastian's Place: Vegan & Raw Food Cafe A place to  Eat, Heal, Love and Nourish the Mind & SpiritMuch Love & Thank you!Carrie, The Caring Cook & The Vegan Food Alchemist!+ her sidekick Ptolemy, The Little Vegan Chef+ Paul, her loving husband, her Muse and special Healing Man in his own Right ( plus I'm sure he will be happy to get the home kitchen back to cook up his special dishes)+ Gabriel the Little Master of Love & Cheekinessand  of course Sebastian, the most perfect and beautiful first born a mother could ask for.

This unique management company is setup with a drive to gain success for all its artist and music worldwide. We have the will to unify a community through music to keep LIVE MUSICIANS thriving and working. Indie Music has a hard time reaching the masses and many projects go unheard by the music world due to their inability to promote and market. Batalla Management is geared to help the indie artist break into the music community and get their music heard by many fans. The musicians sacrifice days and nights away from their family to put on great shows, record great music and give us the songs we listen to on a regular basis and most of them live close to the poverty line and in time decide to leave their dreams behind due to the lack of support from fans and venues. With its unique business structure Batalla Management is set up to gain more success for the musicians and also encourage them to develop their music on their terms with a wall of support that won't allow them to give up.

<p></p> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div> </div><p></p><div>
</div><p>Any
build out of a commercial space is costly which is why we have been carefully
working on numbers to create this kitchen. Assuming we don’t have any major
set-backs, we have gotten an estimate for the cost of the build out as a total
of $35,200. </p><div>
</div><p>Here
is the breakdown: </p><div>
</div><ul>
<li><p>Electrical
Service upgrade: $2,500.00</p></li>
<li><p>Electrical
wiring, cooktop etc.: $950.00</p></li>
<li><p>HVAC:
$3,450.00</p></li>
<li><p>Suppression
hood and vent system: $8,000.00</p></li>
<li><p>Kitchen
sink and plumbing: $1,800.00</p></li>
<li><p>Fresh
flooring and paint: $1,500.00</p></li>
<li><p>Countertops,

<li><p>Front
door repair, ceiling and extras: $1,400</p></li>
<li><p>Commercial
Oven: $3000</p></li>
<li><p>Stovetop:
$2000</p></li>
<li><p>Commercial
Fridge/freezer combo: $5,000</p></li>
<li><p>Workstation:
$1700</p></li>
</ul><div>
</div><p>So
as you can see we have everything that is needed for the build out including
the kitchen sink. We aren’t asking for the whole enchilada to be funded through
this campaign though; we know there is a certain amount of time and money that
Kickshaws simply must get covered. We
are working closely with the City of Fredericksburg's department of Economic
Development as well as Slow Food RVA to work towards making this Kitchen a
reality. So here is what we are hoping to get covered in the Indiegogo campaign:
</p><div>
</div><ul>
<li><p>Electrical
Service upgrade: $2,500.00</p></li>
<li><p>Electrical
wiring/cook top/stove/4 convenience outlets/HVAC/Hood: $950.00</p></li>
<li><p>HVAC:

<li><p>Suppression

<p><b>TOTAL $18,200</b></p>

</ul><div>
If
we can get the preliminary build out costs like the hood and fire suppression
system out of the way, we will work towards making the rest happen. If our
campaign is not completely funded, we are still going to be moving forward with
the build it will just be a project we are going to have to slate for later in

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In
Catholic parishes throughout this country, young men and women are leaving us.
Some are choosing to leave, seeking more inclusive churches or no church at
all, unable to remain because of the way we as church treat our gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transgender brothers and sisters. </p>
<p>Others
are forced to exit, unwilling to sit in the pews of a church that denies their
basic human dignity. They feel abandoned by the church in which they grew up,
were baptized in and received other sacraments. They are called names by that
church in its official documents—referred to as “intrinsically disordered,”
“gravely depraved” or “contrary to nature.” In some cases they have been fired
for who they are, in others they’ve been allowed to stay as long as they remain
closeted.</p>
<p>And
then there are those of us that have decided to stay, choosing to live
authentic lives, honoring God’s creation and believing that the church we love
will eventually love us back.</p>
<p>All
LGBT Catholics, whether we’ve left or stayed, carry deep emotional and
spiritual scars—scars left by church teaching, literal interpretations of
Scripture, political battles and sacraments being denied to us and our loved
ones. We also carry scars left by a laity that has either assisted in such
spiritual violence or has sat idly by as our brothers and sisters have suffered
and in many cases died.</p>
<p><b>We have failed them and us, and
as the people of God we are better than that. </b></p>
<p>Church
teaching is clear—gay and lesbian men and women must be accepted with respect,
compassion and sensitivity. We have been told that the hand of the church has
been outstretched to us and we have been asked to do the same. </p>
<p>It’s
long past time that we do just that. If we don’t we face the real possibility
of losing an entire generation of Catholics. A 2014 Pew Research study showed
that 85% of young people ages 18-29 believe that society should be accepting of
homosexuality. They won’t tolerate the silence, the discrimination and the
ideological battles that have kept us from being true disciples of Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>Our
world is deeply hurting. Families are struggling, our prisons are full and our
libraries are empty. In a nation of immense resources so many of our children
go hungry and too many of our veterans are homeless. Racial inequality and its
long and deep roots continue to plague us and our neighborhoods. Immigrant
families are torn apart due to antiquated policies that require reform. </p>
<p>The
Roman Catholic Church, and we, the lay men and women that make up the Body of
Christ, can and should provide a powerful witness in the public square.
However, in order to do that, we need to come together and work toward
reconciliation and renewal. </p><p><br/></p><p>
</p><p><b>The San Damiano Center seeks to bring about reconciliation in the Roman
Catholic Church in the United States by:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span>Working to end divisiveness and ideological rifts,
seeking to find common ground to bring about the common good. </p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span>Fostering an honest and respectful dialogue between
gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Catholics, their allies, families and church
leaders. Raising up the stories of faithful lives authentically lived by LGBT
Catholics, we will work to change hearts and minds, working toward acceptance,
compassion and respect called for by church teaching. </p>
<p>3.<span> 
</span>Being a public voice for change in the church and
the world through earned media and digital outreach; conferences, workshops and
retreats; and public speaking tours. </p>
<p><b>The San Damiano Center seeks to bring about renewal in the Roman Catholic
Church in the United States by:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span>Seeking to return our church to its rich history of
seeking the common good, especially in advocating for the poor, bringing about
racial justice and caring for God’s creation by organizing lay Catholics around
these issues at the local and state levels.</p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span>Assisting parishes and dioceses in navigating paths
toward acceptance of LGBT Catholics in their communities, informed by church
teaching that calls for respect, compassion and love. </p>
<p>3.<span> 
</span>Conducting programming and developing publications
that emphasize the need for spiritual growth and leadership development among
lay Catholics.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><br/></b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Francis and the Church of San Damiano</b></p><p>About 800 years ago, in the hillside near
Assisi, a young man prayed in the midst of the ruins of an old Italian church.
There, the legend goes, St. Francis heard the voice of God tell him to “rebuild
my church.” Francis, eager to please God, began the hard work of clearing away
the rubble and started the process of literally rebuilding the Church of San
Damiano and other churches nearby.</p>
<p>Eventually he realized that God meant for
him to also rebuild God’s church in a more figurative way, providing a witness
that continues to inspire Christians and other people of faith the world over. </p>
<p>It is in this spirit that we begin our

<p></p></div>","In
Catholic parishes throughout this country, young men and women are leaving us.
Some are choosing to leave, seeking more inclusive churches or no church at
all, unable to remain because of the way we as church treat our gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transgender brothers and sisters. 
Others
are forced to exit, unwilling to sit in the pews of a church that denies their
basic human dignity. They feel abandoned by the church in which they grew up,
were baptized in and received other sacraments. They are called names by that
church in its official documents—referred to as “intrinsically disordered,”
“gravely depraved” or “contrary to nature.” In some cases they have been fired
for who they are, in others they’ve been allowed to stay as long as they remain
closeted.
And
then there are those of us that have decided to stay, choosing to live
authentic lives, honoring God’s creation and believing that the church we love
will eventually love us back.
All
LGBT Catholics, whether we’ve left or stayed, carry deep emotional and
spiritual scars—scars left by church teaching, literal interpretations of
Scripture, political battles and sacraments being denied to us and our loved
ones. We also carry scars left by a laity that has either assisted in such
spiritual violence or has sat idly by as our brothers and sisters have suffered
and in many cases died.
We have failed them and us, and
as the people of God we are better than that. 
Church
teaching is clear—gay and lesbian men and women must be accepted with respect,
compassion and sensitivity. We have been told that the hand of the church has
been outstretched to us and we have been asked to do the same. 
It’s
long past time that we do just that. If we don’t we face the real possibility
of losing an entire generation of Catholics. A 2014 Pew Research study showed
that 85% of young people ages 18-29 believe that society should be accepting of
homosexuality. They won’t tolerate the silence, the discrimination and the
ideological battles that have kept us from being true disciples of Jesus
Christ.
Our
world is deeply hurting. Families are struggling, our prisons are full and our
libraries are empty. In a nation of immense resources so many of our children
go hungry and too many of our veterans are homeless. Racial inequality and its
long and deep roots continue to plague us and our neighborhoods. Immigrant
families are torn apart due to antiquated policies that require reform. 
The
Roman Catholic Church, and we, the lay men and women that make up the Body of
Christ, can and should provide a powerful witness in the public square.
However, in order to do that, we need to come together and work toward
reconciliation and renewal. 
The San Damiano Center seeks to bring about reconciliation in the Roman
Catholic Church in the United States by:

1. 
Working to end divisiveness and ideological rifts,
seeking to find common ground to bring about the common good. 
2. 
Fostering an honest and respectful dialogue between
gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Catholics, their allies, families and church
leaders. Raising up the stories of faithful lives authentically lived by LGBT
Catholics, we will work to change hearts and minds, working toward acceptance,
compassion and respect called for by church teaching. 
3. 
Being a public voice for change in the church and
the world through earned media and digital outreach; conferences, workshops and
retreats; and public speaking tours. 
The San Damiano Center seeks to bring about renewal in the Roman Catholic
Church in the United States by:

1. 
Seeking to return our church to its rich history of
seeking the common good, especially in advocating for the poor, bringing about
racial justice and caring for God’s creation by organizing lay Catholics around
these issues at the local and state levels.
2. 
Assisting parishes and dioceses in navigating paths
toward acceptance of LGBT Catholics in their communities, informed by church
teaching that calls for respect, compassion and love. 
3. 
Conducting programming and developing publications
that emphasize the need for spiritual growth and leadership development among
lay Catholics.
Francis and the Church of San DamianoAbout 800 years ago, in the hillside near
Assisi, a young man prayed in the midst of the ruins of an old Italian church.
There, the legend goes, St. Francis heard the voice of God tell him to “rebuild
my church.” Francis, eager to please God, began the hard work of clearing away
the rubble and started the process of literally rebuilding the Church of San
Damiano and other churches nearby.
Eventually he realized that God meant for
him to also rebuild God’s church in a more figurative way, providing a witness
that continues to inspire Christians and other people of faith the world over. 
It is in this spirit that we begin our
work together, building a movement of lay Catholics who seek to rebuild the
church from within by having the challenging conversations, doing the important
work of bringing about real change in the world and providing a powerful
witness to that world of what church can mean today.Funding raised in this campaign will help build the foundation for the organization and our work in building a new movement of lay Catholics.

<h3>Hello...</h3> <p>My name is Michael Brown-or just Mike among friends. I am an architect in a small town called Staunton in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. I've been doing architecture for most of my life-it's the only job I have ever had. I've been doing it on my own here in Staunton since 1999 when my wife and I moved here from Atlanta. <br/></p>
<p>I have had a great time doing what I love and I have helped a lot of people realize their dreams along the way. I have also been able to voluntarily donate my skills to help individuals, churches and synagogues, and my town. Helping out is something that is important to me, and, I think, is a feature of most small-town architects. <br/></p>
<p>In the news you read about a lot of star architects and giant firms. You don't hear about the fact that most architects are sole proprietors, doing good in the ways I have just described.</p>
<p>So why am I here on Indiegogo? Well, we have all lived through the Great Recession, and for architects it started as early as December 2007. It finally seems to be coming to an end, thank goodness, and I have managed to survive it. But it has left me in a greatly weakened state even as the volume of work I have picks up again. By this I mean that I have old and broken-down equipment, obsolete software, and lots of debt. It makes it more difficult to do my job and to help others as I like to do.</p>
<p>There are a lot of examples of fundraising for <i>new</i>  ventures and projects. This is an example of a venture that is a proven success, after 16 years, and is also a proven survivor! So by doing what you can here, you can help to make sure that this venture can re-make itself for the next era, and keep it and me moving forward and by extension-help others move forward and realize their dreams as well.</p>

<li>New Computer: My existing computer is still using Windows XP!</li>
<li>New Plotter: My plotter is from the year 2000. I can only plot to it using the first computer I bought for the business in 1999-it still works for now and I only use it for plotting drawings.</li>
<li>Smart Phone: Right now I only have a basic cell phone and I could really make use of new technologies and apps in my work.</li>
<li>Software Upgrades: CADD and other software is expensive and I need to update mine.</li>
<li>Library: I need new codebooks and other resources.</li>
<li>Training! I need to update myself to use new software in order to keep up with trends in my industry.</li>
<li>Website: It really needs an upgrade.<br/>

<p></p>
<h3>The Impact...</h3>Now and in the past I have given voluntarily in numerous ways:<ul>
<li>I sit on the Historic Preservation Commission for <a href=""http://www.visitstaunton.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Staunton, VA</a>. </li>
<li>I have helped out <a href=""http://thoi.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Temple House of Israel</a> synagogue, <a href=""http://mcbarch.com/Commercial/C-Religious/C-Ebenezer%20Baptist/C-Ebenezer%20Baptist.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ebenezer Baptist Church</a>, and a number of others with projects they had to get done-projects involving accessibility for the handicapped, preschools, and other functions.</li>
<li>I have helped individuals and businesses with problems they had with the building code, accessibility, safety, structures, and more.</li>
<li>I act as the CFO of <a href=""http://friendsofkebyar.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Friends of Kebyar</a>, and organization that publishes architectural journals world-wide promoting organic architecture.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can help me to keep doing these functions, so vital to a small town, and around the world, as well as helping me to continue to bring good architecture to the area.<br/></p>

It finally seems to be coming to an end, thank goodness, and I have managed to survive it. But it has left me in a greatly weakened state even as the volume of work I have picks up again. By this I mean that I have old and broken-down equipment, obsolete software, and lots of debt. It makes it more difficult to do my job and to help others as I like to do.
There are a lot of examples of fundraising for new  ventures and projects. This is an example of a venture that is a proven success, after 16 years, and is also a proven survivor! So by doing what you can here, you can help to make sure that this venture can re-make itself for the next era, and keep it and me moving forward and by extension-help others move forward and realize their dreams as well.
Here are some places you can see more about Michael C. Brown / Architect:

Thank you for your time and your help!


More Details...
Needs:
New Computer: My existing computer is still using Windows XP!
New Plotter: My plotter is from the year 2000. I can only plot to it using the first computer I bought for the business in 1999-it still works for now and I only use it for plotting drawings.
Smart Phone: Right now I only have a basic cell phone and I could really make use of new technologies and apps in my work.
Software Upgrades: CADD and other software is expensive and I need to update mine.
Library: I need new codebooks and other resources.
Training! I need to update myself to use new software in order to keep up with trends in my industry.
Website: It really needs an upgrade.


You can see for yourself what some of these items look like in my video.
If I don't make it to the goal above, I'll simply prioritize what I can do from this list.


The Impact...Now and in the past I have given voluntarily in numerous ways:
I sit on the Historic Preservation Commission for Staunton, VA. 
I have helped out Temple House of Israel synagogue, Ebenezer Baptist Church, and a number of others with projects they had to get done-projects involving accessibility for the handicapped, preschools, and other functions.
I have helped individuals and businesses with problems they had with the building code, accessibility, safety, structures, and more.
I act as the CFO of Friends of Kebyar, and organization that publishes architectural journals world-wide promoting organic architecture.

You can help me to keep doing these functions, so vital to a small town, and around the world, as well as helping me to continue to bring good architecture to the area.


 
Other Ways You Can Help... I realize that not everyone can contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help: 
Spread the word about this campaign-use social media.

Use the Indiegogo share tools!

 
Thank you!

Some of our proud partners and sponsors include:

This facility is one of the resources we make
available to the women.
What is our project?So let’s get right to the point. We need your help to contain our facility cost so that we can continue to provide and expand our survivor services.  For example, we could collaborate with local hospitals and imaging centers to provide 3,190 mammograms,  transportation to treatment for 400 women and prosthetics for 25 women. How long will it take to complete our project?Although we already help many women during their treatment, we expect that it will take 2 months from the day this project is funded to eliminate most of our facility costs. How much backing do we need to complete our project?To increase services to underserved women we are asking for a total of $497,465.How will the money be used?  The money will be used to expand our survivor services to underserved women and contain facility cost.What perks are we offering?As an incentive we are offering several perks as a small gesture of gratitude for your support. See the perks structure sidebar. $5 - USB Drive Key Chain$10 - Stylus$25 - Selfie Stick$50 - Power Pack$75 - Bluetooth Speaker$100 - Laptop Bag$500 - Samsung Tablet$1000 - Surface Tablet/PCCan we deliver the perks we promise in a timely fashion?These rewards are provided by a reputable service provider which offers insurance for its delivery of the items.
What
will we do if we get more than we asked for?
If
we raise more than the target, 10% of the excess will be evenly distributed
between Cure Breast Cancer Foundation, for research on the growth and spreading
of breast cancer cells known as the Self-Seeding Theory and Steeplechase Cancer
Center, RWJ, Somerset for research targeting African American women and access
to mammograms. Additionally, funds would be used to establish a Sisters Network
of Central New Jersey Inc. survivor’s endowment fund.

Why
is this project worth the money?
This project is worth the money because it WILL save lives.

<p><b>The Need for the Project and for its Expansion:<br/></b></p>
<p>Getting married and starting one's own home is expensive for any couple and that much harder when the bride or groom or both are orphaned from one or both parents. </p>
<p>A few weeks ago, one of our volunteers noticed that a bridal gown store / rental service was closing and selling off their dresses very cheaply. She offered to sponsor a certain amount and together we went to look at the stock. Of the over 200 bridal gowns, 60 were found to be suitable for our brides. We have obtained these 60 bridal gowns but now need to obtain sturdy rails, a full length portable mirror, mannequin and other details in order to arrange these beautiful dresses. They are no help to anyone sitting in black bags. A number of the dresses are in need of cleaning, ironing and minor repairs. With this addition, we need to move our services to larger premises and this obviously will incur costs.</p>
<p>Our Bayit Chadash store is currently located in our strong room which is approximately 3m x 3m or a bit smaller. It can be seen in the video. As you can see there is no space for 2-3 sturdy clothes stands of 2m each. In the video you can see a few of the dresses on our one small clothes stand that is for our Simchah gowns. <br/></p>
<p>Aside from the exciting addition of 60 bridal gowns we already need another set of shelves to display household items that come in.</p>
<p>The dry cleaning costs ₪80 per bridal gown or approximately $22. This is per gown. The total would be roughly $1300.<br/></p>
<p>Each sturdy stand is approximately ₪350 plus ₪100 (per each item) for delivery or approximately $120 per sturdy stand.</p>We have not yet found a full length mirror we are happy with. Prices at this stage are about ₪300 plus delivery ₪100 giving a total in dollars of around $110.<br/><br/>We are still in the process of sourcing a suitable mannequin.<br/><br/>Moving cost is over ₪2000 (about $550). The exact price will vary depending on timing. Donors are welcome to contact us for more info.<br/><br/>Rental of new premises is approximately ₪5000 (about $1350) a month depending on size and location which depends in turn on donations that come in. If possible, we need funds to cover us for a few months while we find new premises, move and set up everything. This will be time during which we cannot earn as we will be busy with the practicalities of setting up the new premises.<br/><br/> A further important note regarding premises, since Shoshanah is an occupational therapist by profession, care is given to the special needs or disabled bride to or the bride who has a disabled or special needs mother. For this reason, we need to move to a suitable venue that will be accessible to the disabled, both for those in wheelchairs and other mobility or visual deficits.<br/>
<br/><p><b>One Success Story</b></p>
<p>Chaim
and Yehudit were preparing to marry. Chaim had lost his father while still a
teenager and his mother had fallen on hard times. In addition to lacking the
finances to make the wedding a success, his mother was living in another
country. He lacked his father figure to help him prepare his wedding. Yehudit
also had minimal contact or support from her family. It was Yehudit who took
the initiative to contact Chessed Ve'Emet for assistance, as Chaim felt so
embarrassed in his difficult situation. </p>
<p>After
meeting us, it was clear the couple were in need of a variety of items and their
wedding arrangements were incomplete. We were able to provide the couple with a
selection of wonderful new items for their new home. The couple had expressed
their sadness at not having suitable beds. After a brief discussion, we
encouraged them in the direction of following in the laws of Jewish Family Purity
and purchased two quality single beds for the couple to able to fulfill the laws
in accordance with authentic Jewish law. </p>
<p>In
addition, we took an active part in preparing and arranging a variety of
important details of the wedding. This included: a professional make up artist
who volunteered her service, a professional hair stylist who offered her
service at no charge. We arranged a group of girls from one of the Jewish
seminaries to take part in making the bride happy with their dancing, as she
did not have enough guests at the wedding. For the groom we arranged a brand
new quality suit as well as shoes, a driver brought him to the wedding. As a
result of our intervention, the widowed mother made the decision to come, which
was sponsored by a relative. We arranged the catering from a suitable and
accepted Kosher caterer. We attended the wedding and took an active part by
being a witness as required by Jewish law and taking care of the niece of 8
months old so that she did not disturb the wedding ceremony and arranging last
minute details required at the wedding. Boys from a Yeshiva (place of Torah learning)
were arranged to dance for the groom and to bring additional happiness to him
too. It was an occasion that was filled with tremendous joy for everyone
involved. </p>
<p>Support
was offered to the mother for the week after the wedding that she was in Israel as there
were times she was on her own.</p>
<p><b>Why We Need Funding Help
to Keep it Operational. </b></p>
<p>We
want to continue to be able to offer further assistance to couples as we have
been doing up to now. We are in need of additional funds to continue running
this part of the organization and to expand further. We would like to create a warm, friendly atmosphere and one that will enable us to offer
more to more couples.</p>

</p><p>My wife Debra and I have created the first Scottish Style
Distillery on the Isle of Whidbey in the Pacific Northwest. We are looking for
your help to raise $30,000 to fund the spirit ingredients, additional
materials, equipment and supplies required to help create our spirits. </p><p>For your contribution we are offering gifts related to our brand ranging from the first batch of spirits in full production (we have been testing and creating profiles) to a selection of t-shirts, hats, candles, whiskey glasses and sipping stones as well as invitations to tasting events.  If we do not reach our full goal we will simply offer less product to start in the market and build the business from that point. This is the first phase in our journey and we hope you will be a part of it.</p><p>With your help we will be able
to launch Cadée Distillery, offering a selection of Vodka, Gin and a selection
of Whiskies. You can be part of this incredible journey and help us create a
local business, supporting local people, and selling a handcrafted Whidbey Island product on a global level.</p>
<p>We have launched multiple businesses over the years (we are old),
some very successful, some not so.  All were
key business and life lessons for us to learn from and subsequently make better
decisions.  We have full licensing and approval for the distillery, and we anticipate a launch date in September 2015. </p>
<p>In the meantime we are actively operating the business in
Clinton, Washington on Whidbey Island. 
We have the tasting room ready to go and bottles
waiting to be filled. We know some of you will not be able to contribute

Distillery on the Isle of Whidbey in the Pacific Northwest. We are looking for
your help to raise $30,000 to fund the spirit ingredients, additional
materials, equipment and supplies required to help create our spirits. For your contribution we are offering gifts related to our brand ranging from the first batch of spirits in full production (we have been testing and creating profiles) to a selection of t-shirts, hats, candles, whiskey glasses and sipping stones as well as invitations to tasting events.  If we do not reach our full goal we will simply offer less product to start in the market and build the business from that point. This is the first phase in our journey and we hope you will be a part of it.With your help we will be able
to launch Cadée Distillery, offering a selection of Vodka, Gin and a selection
of Whiskies. You can be part of this incredible journey and help us create a
local business, supporting local people, and selling a handcrafted Whidbey Island product on a global level.
We have launched multiple businesses over the years (we are old),
some very successful, some not so.  All were
key business and life lessons for us to learn from and subsequently make better
decisions.  We have full licensing and approval for the distillery, and we anticipate a launch date in September 2015. 
In the meantime we are actively operating the business in
Clinton, Washington on Whidbey Island. 
We have the tasting room ready to go and bottles
waiting to be filled. We know some of you will not be able to contribute
financially, but you can still help by getting the word out and making some noise
about our campaign.

<p></p><p><b>OBJECTIVE</b></p>
<p>MyAttik is
determined to propose a serious alternative to the current economic models. The
creators wish to encourage a culture where human qualities and values such as
solidarity and recuperation are put forward.</p><p>

is co-founded with Aboubakar Tirera. He arrived to Montreal three years ago, with
a focus on growing through enterpreneurship a project, which stimulates a collaborative
economy and contributes to sustainable development.</span><p></p>
<p><span>The
inspiration behind MyAttik came after living a year and a half in Montreal,
several relocations within the city, and several introductions within the local
community, which offered donations following his arrival to Quebec.</span></p>
<p><span>Through
his discovery of flourishing neighborhood life, a goal was set to launch an
accessible, intuitive, and innovative platform for citizens that wish to participate
in the sharing economy.</span></p>
<p><span>This
unique concept was born following his adventures in Montreal and from the effort
of the motivated and ambitious team of MyAttik.</span></p>
<p><span>This
project is nomited for the Startup Canada Awards of 2015 and for the Montreal
Foundation Inc. Awards of 2015.</span></p>
<p><span>Contribute

<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>VALUES</b></p>
<p>The creator
of MyAttik is a young Montreal contractor who believes in the force of the
communities and the capacity of the citizens to organize themselves in favour
of a collaborative economy. </p>
<p>The
founders wish to demonstrate that each citizen can act on their own scale and
without much budget, and to show that this is effective only thanks to networking.
They believe that a positive transformation of our mode of consumption will
come only from one collective process.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>TIMELINE MY ATTIK</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442849231/o7vny2jesmjaaljabsne.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 619.684px; height: 368px;""/></p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440637724/lgxeru5looqmjroozlnn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p align=""center""><b>WHAT’S THE
PURPOSE OF THE CROWDFUNDING?</b></p>
<p>Three
levels, I’m counting on you!</p>
<p><b>4 000 $</b></p>
<p>The 4 000
$ threshold will make it possible for My Attik to launch the platform this
coming fall. The collected sum will be used to cover the costs of starting, but
also to finalize the design of the platform and the tests.</p>
<p><b>=&gt;</b> 2 000 $ to finalize the design
of the platform and to make it as intuitive as possible.</p>
<p><b>=&gt;</b> 1 000 $ to improve the
development of the platform and to make it the safest and the most powerful as
possible.</p>
<p><b>=&gt;</b> 1 000 $ to deploy the means of
communication necessary to the fall launch. This stage is one of upmost importance
because MyAttik must bring together very many users in order to be really
effective.</p>
<p><b>7 000
$</b></p>
<p>The 7 000
$ threshold will allow the creation of a portable application and to take part
in the <i>Salon carrière et développement
professionnel</i> (career and professional development day) that will take
place in Montreal on October 7, 2015 and
would give a great visibility to the project as well as bring in new talents.</p>
<p><b>=&gt;</b> 2 000 $ for the development of the MyAttik
portable application.</p>
<p><b>=&gt;</b> 500 $ for the stand at the <i>Salon</i> in October.</p>
<p><b>=&gt;</b> 500 $ for the run of the Montreal
universities.</p>
<p><b>11 000$
and +</b></p>
<p>If your
participation is so generous that the level of 11.000 $ is exceeded, that will
allow MyAttik to develop the second
version (V2), more evolved and offering more options, in addition
to the objectives previously mentioned. This sum will allow:</p>
<p><b>=&gt;</b> To reinforce our team of developers and advertisement
moderators. </p>
<p><b>=&gt;</b> To lead field actions across Canada to let the platform
be discovered by more people.</p>
<p><b>=&gt;</b> To have our own offices in Montreal.</p>

CLIQUEZ ICI POUR LA VERSION FRANCAISE ! >>> MYATTIK : THE FIRST SOCIAL NETWORK OF CLASSIFIED ADS
TAKE PART IN THE CREATION OF A NEW LEVER OF ACTION FOR A POSITIVE TRANSFORMATION IN OUR MODES OF CONSUMPTION
THE PREMISE
In
an interconnected world offering opportunities for collaboration, we increasingly
want to consume in an environmentally responsible manner. Through technological
innovation, we are ready to find an alternative to our consumption patterns.
MyAttik
provides this alternative, by offering you to participate in a collaborative and
sustainable development economy.
We
promote behavior that drives ownership of our environment footprint, since a
different consumption pattern is now a
necessity.



THE CONCEPT
MyAttik
is first as a social network to devote itselft to member driven ads. This new
innovative and intuitive platform integrates the strengths of a traditional
classifieds site, by including the following features.
MyAttik
offers the opportunity for viewership by the general public or restricted
communities of all your objects meant for sale, rent, or exchange. You can chat
with other membres directly on the site, though instant messaging; also, you
can create public and private groups and events for a garage sale, flea market,
or sidewalk sale.
=> Your
platform is intuitive to facilitate sharing.
=> Your
cart Messenger is a virtual shopping cart that includes all advertisements of
interest you selected during a session, and it enables you to contact directly
and much quickly the sellers from a single location. 

=> Our
quick sorting system allows you to find exchange opportunties and bargains much
faster,one click away for all ad types (sale, rent, or exchange).
=> Your
personal virtual attic includes a configurable management dashboard for your objects,
which allows you to promote, delete or edit an ad.

=> Chat:
Instant messaging among friends to facilitate communication.
=> An
Attik coin allows you to promote an announcement by giving it more visibility
in the upper part of the platform, which is labeled as Sunshine. Several coins
can be earned by contributing to our launch campaign.
OBJECTIVE
MyAttik is
determined to propose a serious alternative to the current economic models. The
creators wish to encourage a culture where human qualities and values such as
solidarity and recuperation are put forward.
CO-FOUNDERMyAttik
is co-founded with Aboubakar Tirera. He arrived to Montreal three years ago, with
a focus on growing through enterpreneurship a project, which stimulates a collaborative
economy and contributes to sustainable development.
The
inspiration behind MyAttik came after living a year and a half in Montreal,
several relocations within the city, and several introductions within the local
community, which offered donations following his arrival to Quebec.
Through
his discovery of flourishing neighborhood life, a goal was set to launch an
accessible, intuitive, and innovative platform for citizens that wish to participate
in the sharing economy.
This
unique concept was born following his adventures in Montreal and from the effort
of the motivated and ambitious team of MyAttik.
This
project is nomited for the Startup Canada Awards of 2015 and for the Montreal
Foundation Inc. Awards of 2015.
Contribute
to the success of our project!
VALUES
The creator
of MyAttik is a young Montreal contractor who believes in the force of the
communities and the capacity of the citizens to organize themselves in favour
of a collaborative economy. 
The
founders wish to demonstrate that each citizen can act on their own scale and
without much budget, and to show that this is effective only thanks to networking.
They believe that a positive transformation of our mode of consumption will
come only from one collective process.TIMELINE MY ATTIK
WHAT’S THE
PURPOSE OF THE CROWDFUNDING?
Three
levels, I’m counting on you!
4 000 $
The 4 000
$ threshold will make it possible for My Attik to launch the platform this
coming fall. The collected sum will be used to cover the costs of starting, but
also to finalize the design of the platform and the tests.
=> 2 000 $ to finalize the design
of the platform and to make it as intuitive as possible.
=> 1 000 $ to improve the
development of the platform and to make it the safest and the most powerful as
possible.
=> 1 000 $ to deploy the means of
communication necessary to the fall launch. This stage is one of upmost importance
because MyAttik must bring together very many users in order to be really
effective.
7 000
$
The 7 000
$ threshold will allow the creation of a portable application and to take part
in the Salon carrière et développement
professionnel (career and professional development day) that will take
place in Montreal on October 7, 2015 and
would give a great visibility to the project as well as bring in new talents.
=> 2 000 $ for the development of the MyAttik
portable application.
=> 500 $ for the stand at the Salon in October.
=> 500 $ for the run of the Montreal
universities.
11 000$
and +
If your
participation is so generous that the level of 11.000 $ is exceeded, that will
allow MyAttik to develop the second
version (V2), more evolved and offering more options, in addition
to the objectives previously mentioned. This sum will allow:
=> To reinforce our team of developers and advertisement
moderators. 
=> To lead field actions across Canada to let the platform
be discovered by more people.
=> To have our own offices in Montreal.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PARTICIPEZ À LA CRÉATION D'UN NOUVEAU LEVIER D'ACTION POUR UNE
TRANSFORMATION POSITIVE DE NOS MODES DE CONSOMMATIONLE CONSTAT

Nous évoluons dans un monde
interconnecté qui ne cesse de faire émerger des solutions d'entraide. Nous
constatons aussi que, de plus en plus, de citoyens souhaitent consommer de
manière écoresponsable et que nombreux sont ceux qui sont prêts à saisir des avancées
technologiques pour trouver des alternatives à leur mode de consommation. 
L'objectif de MyAttik est de
proposer une alternative pour les citoyens qui souhaitent s'engager dans un
processus qui encouragent l'économie collaborative et le développement durable.

Nous favorisons les
comportements écoresponsables ; consommer autrement est devenu une nécessité
aujourd'hui. 
LE CONCEPT
MyAttik est le premier réseau
social uniquement consacré aux petites annonces. Cette nouvelle plateforme
innovante et intuitive intègre les atouts d'un site traditionnel de petites
annonces en y ajoutant de nouvelles fonctionnalités.
MyAttik offrira à chaque utilisateur la
possibilité de rendre visible au grand public ou à des communautés restreintes
tous les objets qu'il souhaite vendre, louer, donner ou échanger. Les
utilisateurs pourront directement discuter entre eux, sur le site, créer des
groupes publics ou privés et des événements (vente de garage, brocante, ventes
de trottoir). 
=> Votre plateforme : une
plateforme intuitive qui facilite le partage.=> Votre panier Messenger :
l'utilisateur peut ajouter toute annonce dans son ""panier virtuel""
lors de sa visite et contacter tous les annonceurs d'un coup, à partir du
panier, sans perdre du temps. 

=> Un système de tri rapide : l'option
permet aux utilisateurs de trier en un clic toutes les annonces par type
(vente, louer, donner et échanger) ; ce qui permet aux utilisateurs d'échanger plus
rapidement et à moindre coût. 
=> Votre grenier : mise à
disposition d'un grenier virtuel paramétrable par l'utilisateur dans son
tableau de bord et à la gestion des objets du grenier (promouvoir, supprimer et
modifier l'annonce). 
=>Tchat : messagerie
instantanée entre amis pour faciliter la communication. 
=> La pièce Attik : elle permet
à l'utilisateur de promouvoir son annonce et de lui donner plus de visibilité
dans la partie haute de la plateforme (sunshine). En participant à la campagne,
gagnez plein de pièces Attik.

<p>My name is Nancy Guinn and I am the owner of Dog Krazy in
Downtown Fredericksburg, VA.  I opened
Dog Krazy in August of 2006 with no idea of what it meant to own a
business.  All I knew was that I loved my
dogs, your dogs, every dog I passed on the street and even the dogs I hadn’t
met yet.  I truly am Dog Krazy.  In the 9 years since I opened, I have learned
so much about business, pets, nutrition, and I have fallen in love with
thousands of dogs and their humans.  Dog
Krazy is the ""go to"" for people who truly love their pets and want only the best
for them.  I am now a certified pet
nutritionist and several of my employees that share my passion for pets are
completing the same course.  Your pet’s
health is our first priority.  My other
passion is animal rescue.  There are so
many homeless dogs and cats that are waiting for their forever home.  While we are advocates for animal rescue, our
current location is not set up to be able to host adoption events.  While we are able to raise funds to help
animals in needs, we want to do more.</p>
<p><strong>Nova and I on a bench near our store.  She's proof you can adopt pure bred dogs through rescue.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439861960/fu9qks76xqmm2xigifks.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 621.65px; height: 376px;""/></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to open a second location in a space where we
are able to host events for the many rescues surrounding the Fredericksburg
area.  Every day people come in and ask if
we sell puppies.  The term pet store is
not one we are happy about.  We want to
be known as an ADOPT SHOP.  Our goal is
to have a store where events are held every weekend to introduce everyone to
the dogs in foster homes and shelters that are waiting for their forever
families.  Daily, we want to have dogs in
foster care spend the day with us so that people can come in and meet these
wonderful dogs that don’t get the same exposure that puppies in pet shops receive.  </p>
<p>For years we have been saving to make this dream a
reality.  Earlier this year we had finally saved
enough money and we started exploring our options. That’s when I found that
tiny little bump.  Seven years ago we
rescued a 2 year old Bullmastiff that was brought to the vet to be
euthanized.  She needed surgery and her
former owners chose to put her to sleep instead of getting her the surgery she
needed. Nova is our comic relief, our warm hug, our pumpkin head, and our
heart.  That tiny pink bump turned out to
be cancer and we knew that saving her life was more important than a second
store.  After three months of surgeries, the ups and
downs of what if and could be, masses on x-rays and now chemotherapy, she is
free of any signs of cancer and we are ready to make this dream a reality.  </p>
<p>We spent thousands upon thousands saving Nova’s life.  Numerous friends suggested starting a
fundraiser to help pay for all of her medical expenses.  We didn’t feel right asking for help because
we had the money.  It was supposed to be
used for a new store, but Nova trumped that. 
Our dogs will always come first.  Instead
of taking their help, we sent them links to others with donation sites for
their dogs in need of surgery.  They
needed help, we didn’t. </p>
<p>But now, after much urging by those we have helped, we are asking for your help.  We want to make “The Adopt Shop” a
reality.  We need a store that promotes
adoption.  We need a place where people
can come in and meet dogs in foster care on a daily basis.  Even though I am asking you to donate to my
dream, you will not go empty handed.  We have
thought long and hard about what “Perks” we could offer in exchange of you supporting
our dream to help adopt dogs in need.  Even
if you aren’t able to donate, sharing this campaign with family and friends
would be just as helpful.  Thank you for
your contribution in helping my dream come true and that of all the animals
looking for their forever homes.</p>
<p>For those of you that have never been to Dog Krazy, here are
some examples of what we do from our customers that we love…</p>
<p><em><em><em><em><em>
</em></em></em></em></em></p><p><em><em><em><i>In February of 2015 I
noticed a Facebook post from the Spotsylvania Animal Shelter about a 13 yo dog
named Lucy who had just been surrendered by her family.  They claimed she wasn't good with kids.  Having a 13 yo named Georgie, I couldn't
imagine dumping him at the shelter.  I
was worried about how scared the poor little girl would be.  So I posted on the Spotsylvania Animal
Shelter's Facebook page that I was coming in to foster Lucy the next day.  As soon as Nancy, Owner of Dog Krazy, found
out about this she instantly stepped in and donated food for Lucy.  This little old lady was only going to eat
the best, care of Nancy!  Old Dominion
Humane Society also stepped in and brought Lucy into their Foster program so I
didn't have to worry about the shelter asking me to return Lucy.  Lucy was a sweet little girl.  Due to her age she was hard of hearing, her
vision wasn't great and she was arthritic in her legs.  If she was cranky around kids it was because
she wasn't being treated with the respect a woman of her age deserved.  She quickly stole the hearts of my husband
and myself.  Lucy would follow me
anywhere.  We would have adopted her if
it wasn't for the fact that she and my alpha didn't get along.  Unfortunately they had a couple of run
ins.  Until the perfect home came along,
Lucy would have a home with us.  In
April, I took Lucy for a senior check-up at my vet.  Other than a slight heart murmur, her blood
work and vitals were good.  For a 13 yo
Lucy was doing great!  3 short weeks later
she did not eat her dinner.  It was a
really hot day so I just chalked it up to the heat.  Next day wasn't any better.  She wasn't eating much and what she did drink
or eat she was now throwing up.  We made
the decision to take her to the vet and scheduled an appointment for the next
day.  At the vet she had a temp of over
103, she was dehydrated, and her blood work came back all out of whack.  We reluctantly left her at the vet hoping
that antibiotics and fluids would make her feel better.  Unfortunately, Lucy went downhill quickly
once at the vet.  We decided to take her
to an emergency vet so she could get 24 hour care.  Poor girl continued to deteriorate.  No one knew what was going on.  All the test were not giving us any
answers.  Little Lucy's vet bills were
adding up fast.  Every time we visited
our poor girl she looked worse.</i></em></em></em></p><em><em><em>
<p><i>Without prompting,
Nancy again stepped in to help!  She
donated her profits for the day from Dog Krazy to go towards Lucy's care.  She also spoke with a fellow local store
owner, Foode, and they donated funds for Lucy. 
Unfortunately, despite all our best efforts, little Lucy didn't make
it.  Through this sad time, Nancy's
incredible generosity and love for my little Foster girl, and all animals in
need, made the loss a little easier to overcome.  I can never thank Nancy enough for her all
she has done for Lucy.  Nancy even
donated cat food when we had a stray kitten come hang out around our
house.  To have a place like Dog Krazy, where
the owners are truly dog crazy, who truly care about your furry family members,
and who would only sell what they trust to give to their own furry family
members and who also want to give back to their community is a blessing.  – Kristy S.</i></p>
</em></em></em><p></p>
<p><i>Two months ago our 11
year old Yorkie got sick and that's when I decided to reach out to Nancy. Without
knowing who I was, Nancy took the time to message me back and answered all my
questions. Two weeks after we found out that he had CHF. Since then, Nancy has
been helping us along the way.  We
couldn't have done it without her help. We have learned so much about this
condition and how to help our little baby thanks to her and we will be always
grateful for that.  Vivi M.</i></p>
<p><i>Dog Krazy is
amazing.  Years ago I walked into the
original location not looking for anything and fell in love with the store and
the owner.  Never had I met a woman so
passionate about what she does and so passionate about her dogs.  Over the years I continued going to Dog
Krazy. I always bought my dogs necklaces (collars) there, and bought their toys
and they would get special treats from Mrs. Nancy each time we went.  Over the years Nancy befriended my Dachshund
Booker.  Booker was a total jerk...to everyone
but me and everyone but Mrs. Nancy. 
Booker adored that woman.  Nancy
knew Booker for the 6 years I had him before he passed away from cancer almost
a year ago.  Booker even made a special
trip to Dog Krazy to say goodbye to Mrs. Nancy. 
And Nancy, as she would with anyone’s dog, spent over an hour on the
floor with him, petting him and loving on him and giving him every bit of food
he would take.  I ended up adopting
another dog after Booker passed away and Nancy picked his food, his necklace
came from Dog Krazy, his toys came from Dog Krazy and the staff members and
Nancy remember his name even when they don't know mine.  Last year I had been laid off and couldn't
afford much and it was to be my new dog Finn's first Christmas.  Dog Krazy sent a bag full of toys and treats
and gifts for Finn.  Inside that bag was
a card, the card was from Booker.  Booker
said that he asked Mrs. Nancy to take care of his new brother at Christmas and
make it easier on me.  A business owner
doesn't need to do what Nancy does. 
Nancy doesn't have to be involved in the community or with local rescues
or with helping pup parents through their grief.  Most business owners are not friends with all
of their clients.  Nancy is.  She knows all of them, loves most of them,
but adores all of their dogs. And she will be the first one to offer up help
for your dog.  I wouldn't have it any
other way.  A business owner, friend, a
shoulder to cry on, a Santa Claus, a professional and an amazing woman own that
shop because Nancy is all of those things. 
My life, and my dog’s lives wouldn't be the same without her. – Kelley M.</i></p>
<p><i>We adopted Baxter
three years ago when he was about three years old. He came to us shaking his
head all the time. We took him to the vet and they looked for mites and yeast
and an ear infection. They found some yeast and gave us some medicine and said
not to worry about it. Baxter kept having the problem although it got a little
better when we put him on grain-free food. His ears were still chronically red
and sensitive. Around this time we moved to Stafford, VA with the Navy. We
stumbled upon Dog Krazy when we were walking around. Lucky for us Nancy was
there and she talked to us about Baxter's condition. Nancy recommended we go
potato-free, which we hadn't done yet and at least four vets hadn't
recommended. It has changed his life. Baxter's ears have cleared up and he
never shakes his head anymore. I've stopped having to use his ear cleaning
medicine completely. We are beyond grateful and happy. My dogs' health means
the world to me (they are my children). I would do anything to make them happy
and feel great. I know that Nancy and Dog Krazy feel the same way and they have
made a loyal and grateful customer out of me forever!!  Kristin S.</i></p>
<p><i>Ever since meeting
Nancy about 5 years ago there has NEVER been a time where she hasn't helped our
family. Every time we go into her store she makes my family and our dog feel
like we are family. Nancy allows me to call/text her personal cell phone with
any questions I have about my dog. Nancy and her store is the only pet store we
ever shop at and ever will. She's honest, loyal, friendly, and just simply the
best!! We love her and so does our dog Cody. We can simply say, ""Cody
wanna go see Nancy?"" And his ears perk up and he runs to the door! Thank
you for all you do for us, and the community!! – Elizabeth C</i></p>
<p><i>Nancy what can I say
about this Woman, last year I was down and out and I thought I would never be
where I was, I did not have job, I exhausted all I had, and I was facing being
evicted, but worse for me was the fact that i could not feed my best friend
Bandit, I walked in and asked her if there was somewhere I could go to get dog
food for free for Bandit, she asked me if it was for me.  I replied with a yes. There was no hesitation,
she said let me see what I could do.  It
was not my proudest moment, but I had to take care of Bandit, and I knew she
would understand, she came out with a bag full of food and treats that got me
over the hump.  I found an angel is all I
could think of.  I prayed that someone
could help me and she did and on top of that she gave me a ton of information
that would help me get past this time of hardship.  God makes angels and she truly is one, I
would never purchase food from anyone but her, because loyalty is everything to
me, she won my heart with kindness she cares about everyone and everything. Her pets are family just as mine is to
me.  I am indebted for life for her
saving me from the depression and place I was in.  Thank you, I believe in your cause and I will
help when I get back on my feet. Secondly, this woman sent to our K9 soldiers
here in UAE a care package that saved our four legged friends, the cooling vests,
toys, and treats were so well received and our solider were so honored and
grateful that you thought to send such a wonderful package, much applause to
you and the things you do for all humans and K-9's.  – Nancy C.</i></p>

the costs to get this going but we need your help to make it unbelievable!  We are estimating the costs to be

became a 501C3 and we are here to help those that have fallen on hard times. The

she gave us so much love, protection and loyalty. Honoring her by helping those
that have fallen on hard times is our goal.

<p>Opening a business is not for the faint of heart. Luckily,
my heart is ready for round 2 and my doctor said my heart is fine!  Trust me, I had it checked!  Please help us make this dream a

</div><div> </div></div>","My name is Nancy Guinn and I am the owner of Dog Krazy in
Downtown Fredericksburg, VA.  I opened
Dog Krazy in August of 2006 with no idea of what it meant to own a
business.  All I knew was that I loved my
dogs, your dogs, every dog I passed on the street and even the dogs I hadn’t
met yet.  I truly am Dog Krazy.  In the 9 years since I opened, I have learned
so much about business, pets, nutrition, and I have fallen in love with
thousands of dogs and their humans.  Dog
Krazy is the ""go to"" for people who truly love their pets and want only the best
for them.  I am now a certified pet
nutritionist and several of my employees that share my passion for pets are
completing the same course.  Your pet’s
health is our first priority.  My other
passion is animal rescue.  There are so
many homeless dogs and cats that are waiting for their forever home.  While we are advocates for animal rescue, our
current location is not set up to be able to host adoption events.  While we are able to raise funds to help
animals in needs, we want to do more.
Nova and I on a bench near our store.  She's proof you can adopt pure bred dogs through rescue.




Our goal is to open a second location in a space where we
are able to host events for the many rescues surrounding the Fredericksburg
area.  Every day people come in and ask if
we sell puppies.  The term pet store is
not one we are happy about.  We want to
be known as an ADOPT SHOP.  Our goal is
to have a store where events are held every weekend to introduce everyone to
the dogs in foster homes and shelters that are waiting for their forever
families.  Daily, we want to have dogs in
foster care spend the day with us so that people can come in and meet these
wonderful dogs that don’t get the same exposure that puppies in pet shops receive.  
For years we have been saving to make this dream a
reality.  Earlier this year we had finally saved
enough money and we started exploring our options. That’s when I found that
tiny little bump.  Seven years ago we
rescued a 2 year old Bullmastiff that was brought to the vet to be
euthanized.  She needed surgery and her
former owners chose to put her to sleep instead of getting her the surgery she

heart.  That tiny pink bump turned out to
be cancer and we knew that saving her life was more important than a second
store.  After three months of surgeries, the ups and
downs of what if and could be, masses on x-rays and now chemotherapy, she is
free of any signs of cancer and we are ready to make this dream a reality.

became a 501C3 and we are here to help those that have fallen on hard times. The
Fredericksburg SPCA blessed us by choosing us as her family and for 13 years
she gave us so much love, protection and loyalty. Honoring her by helping those
that have fallen on hard times is our goal. 



Opening a business is not for the faint of heart. Luckily,
my heart is ready for round 2 and my doctor said my heart is fine!  Trust me, I had it checked!  Please help us make this dream a
reality.  The dogs in foster care will
thank you!  Who knows, we may introduce
you to your next furry family member!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

I have years of experience working with foster children through respite and habilitation, as well as a passion for working with kids.  Why was I being given sideways glances and turned away from jobs at schools when I knew I was perfect for the positions?<span style=""background-color: initial;"">  After applying and being turned down by numerous jobs (schools, fast food, retail, office, etc) a potential employer finally admitted that they turned me away because I had holes in my ears (even though I wasn't wearing plugs) and a small, innocuous tattoo on my wrist.  I searched the internet for suggestions for places that hire those with visible modifications and, aside from a few obvious answers, there were no resources available to help me. That is the moment the dream was born.<br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<b>What is Urbanvisible?</b><br/>Urbanvisible is a company that advocates for and supports companies that hire individuals with visible modifications, but we need to create a website that can help do that nationwide.  Urbanvisible.com will be a review site similar to many others on the web that helps rate and review businesses based on their products, services, and customer service but is exclusive to those businesses that are open-minded and diverse.  <br/>- For a small monthly fee, businesses will be able to control their own profile with galleries, menus, contact information, applications, and unlike other review sites, they will have control over which reviews actually inform potential customers about their product.  <br/>- By supporting businesses that have fair hiring practices, we as a community can show that it IS important and that you don't need to fear losing business if you don't have the traditional ""professional"" appearance.  By ditching stereotypes and creating equality we actually shift importance to the products and services sold rather than the physical appearance of employees.<br/><br/>
</li> <li>
<b>Why is this important?<br/></b><i>For Individuals</i>:<br/>- It provides a place that you can look for work without fear of being judged because of who you are.<br/>- The power is put into your hands.  We had originally brainstormed starting as a non-profit, trying to change legislature so that companies were forced to hire regardless of modifications, but allowing businesses to make their own choice is very powerful.  We make the choice to get modifications and we have the ability to be positive examples of the community and show others that people are people regardless of physical appearance and tattoos or piercings.  <br/><br/><i>For Businesses</i>:<br/>- This is a completely new avenue to advertise your business.  You already get business for the products and services you provide, but Urbanvisible opens a completely new way for you to gain new customers while simultaneously promoting a great cause.<br/>- Functionality will be similar to existing review sites (ie. Yelp, Urbanspoon, Google Reviews), but with more control,  more options, and less hassle for  advertising payment. Be in control of which reviews actually help describe your business rather than being at the whim of customers that may have been looking to complain about something before they even came in.<br/>- Some people have asked ""why should places like tattoo shops use this service if they obviously hire modified individuals?"".  The answer to this is simple.  A majority of the site's users are interested in tattoo and piercing acceptance in the workplace.  This means that it is the perfect place to showcase the quality of your work as a tattoo artist, piercer, or hairstylist because urbanvisible users are probably already interested in those services. There will even be a separate section for artists, piercers, and stylists.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>Goals and Perks</h3> <ul> <li>The goal is simple.  To complete urbanvisible.com it will take over 500 hours of work costing over $25,000 (not including server space, maintenance, or employee payment). We are passionate about this project and personally affected by discrimination. </li> <li>We're taking a bit of a risk by only offering two perks with this campaign.  You can donate however much you'd like, but the only perks cost $1 and $100.  <br/>-A $1 donation can be considered a vote.  Imagine how many businesses would sign up if they knew 25,000 people were interested in supporting diverse businesses even before the site is launched.<br/>- A $100 donation is for a business that wants to get in on the ground floor.  With a year subscription to urbanvisible, you can be at the forefront of equality and changing hiring practices nationwide.<br/>- The relationship between the perks is a symbiotic one.  The more people that donate $1 to signify their support, the more businesses will pledge $100 for a subscription, therefor giving more people reason to use the website and creating a diverse and equal community.</li> <li>Our team has supporters that have already confirmed they will donate programming time if necessary.  If we do not reach our goal with this campaign alone, they will start building the backbone of the website and the money we do raise will go toward front-end design. The money will still go to the same place; making sure our dream (<a href=""http://www.urbanvisible.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.urbanvisible.com</a>) becomes a reality.  </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>How This Relates To Everyone</h3> <ul> <li>This project is important to everyone.  Even if you have the job you want, it is important to help others in their career search.  Almost everyone has a friend, sibling, child, neighbor, or co-worker that has talent, work ethic, and charisma, but may be held down by their love for modifications.</li>
<li>We look up to entertainers such as musicians, actors, artists, and athletes that have tattoos.  Just because our talents may not lie in a creative field doesn't mean that we need to give up our love for creativity and body art.</li>
<li>I often come across people saying that having tattoos and piercings is ""your choice"".  It is my choice, but how is it different than anything else?  Since I was a child I always loved and admired well done tattoos and thoughtfully placed piercings.  I didn't have a specific role model with them, but always imagined how I would look once my body was adorned.  Every time I get a new piece of art on my body I come closer to my personal ideal image and am able to share beautiful art with people around me.  How is this different than someone losing weight, getting a new haircut, or changing their style? It isn't. All of these things serve to make ourselves feel good, attractive, and most of all, confident.  When I go into a job interview with my piercings out and tattoos covered I feel naked.  I feel like I'm playing someone else's role.  I'm a confident, intelligent, educated, and well-meaning person, but not being able to be myself during a job interview makes me feel like someone other than myself.</li> <li>Tattoos, piercings, alternative hairstyles, and other modifications also help to bring people together.  It doesn't matter what race, ethnicity, sex, gender, religion, or belief system you have.  We can all bond over modifications. </li>
<li>I personally am an avid and competitive Magic: the Gathering player.  Our community has shown strength in diversity by holding tournaments around the world with competitors of all different backgrounds and cultures.  Once you step into the room you are all there sharing an experience no matter who or what you represent.  While I'm playing in a tournament I am free to be me without worry of being judged because of my modifications.  There are plenty of other people with them and even more without, but it doesn't seem to matter.  The winner wins because they earned victory, not because of how they looked on their way there.  This is a personal call to the MTG community to rally behind an ideal that we share like we have many times before.<br/>

<p>The Alder Food Security Society is the non-profit affiliate of the The Alder Room. <b>We have the vision of an Edmonton where local food and our vibrant food community is available to everyone, regardless of income, age or class.  </b><br/></p>
<p>The main goal of the Alder Food Security Society is to <b>give low 
income families, seniors and marginalized groups access to the vibrant 
community associated with our local food system</b>. Not only will creating 
opportunities for local producers and restaurants to reach out to these 
individuals reduce the instances of food insecurity in our city, but 
shopping at farmers' markets, visiting local restaurants and attending 
classes taught by local chefs is a wonderful experience that has 
fostered community connections for many Edmontonians. <b>The cost of these 
experiences, however, is out of reach for the members of our city who 
could benefit from this wonderful community the most. </b><br/></p>
<p><b>It is our goal to reduce this inequality in Edmonton through our programs and a four-tiered approach we believe will address the multifaceted and layered nature of food insecurity in our city. </b>All programs implemented by The Alder Food Security Society will fall under one or more of the following core objectives: <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Food Education For All:</b> We aim to help all Edmontonians learn about the work being done in our food community, define food insecurity, determine the core areas for improvement, and learn about approaches from around the world to help our food system become more equitable and vibrant. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Addressing Immediate Food Insecurity</b>: The Alder Food Security Society will assist food-insecure families directly during times of need with products from our local food system. We will also support the work of already-existing food charities to enhance their reach and raise funds for their invaluable programs.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Capacity Building for Long-Term Food Security</b>: We believe all families should be able to afford and prepare healthy, local food at all times. By providing food education and connecting families to the food community, we believe these families will be able to make changes to reduce their food insecurity in their own lives, on their own terms. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Advocating for Systemic Change</b>: We want to drive real legislative change in our city and province and help create an atmosphere where food insecurity is systemically addressed and the reliance on immediate food charity is deemed unacceptable by our government.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are planning to <b>introduce three community outreach programs to</b> foster community connections, reward the good work being done by those working in poverty reduction, make farmers' market shopping more affordable and approachable for all Edmontonians, and give low-income youths the opportunity to learn from some of the best chefs in the city. The programs will include: <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Monthly Food Chats</b>, where the community at large will be invited to listen to farmers, chefs, researchers and other members of the community as they discuss their work and provide meaningful information about our food system.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Bi-Annual Community Dinners</b> hosted by the Alder Room for hard-working volunteers and deserving individuals in the city in order to give them our thanks for their wonderful work and foster meaningful connections between the movers and shakers in our city.<br/>
</li>
<li> <b>A Youth Job Shadow Program</b>, where youths interested in local food and the culinary arts will have the opportunity to work with some of the best chefs in the city and gain valuable work experience, and 
</li>
<li>
<b>A Farmers' Market Subsidy and Community Kitchen Initiative</b>, where low-income individuals will be given subsidized ""market bucks"" to be used at farmers' markets in Edmonton and connected with others in their community via ""Kitchen Collectives"". These Kitchen Collectives will be toured through the farmers' market by one of our volunteers and will learn how to find high-quality produce at lower prices at market, use group purchases to reduce food costs, and start conversations with local producers. They will prepare a simple meal together in The Alder Room kitchen, learning cooking techniques from our chefs and other members of the group, and each take home a portion of the meal to their families. It is our goal to facilitate the continuation of Kitchen Collectives beyond market day and help families make connections within the community in order to reduce food costs and prep times in the long-term.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Alder Room will be the primary source of funds for the Alder Food 
Security Society, though we plan to accept donations and grants from the
 community as well in order to ""delink"" the reach of the program with 
the revenues of the restaurant. <br/></p>

What We Need


Due to the nature of the heritage building where The Alder Room will be located, the total funds required to open The Alder Room, from construction of the kitchen and installing ventilation systems to stocking the kitchen and bar and developing our menu, is $500,000.

Begin consultation and construction of The Alder Room, including building the kitchen and lounge and installing that pricey ventilation system!

Pay staff to begin research and development for the opening menu, including spending time foraging and networking with local producers.

Gain leverage to approach investors and lending institutions to fulfull our remaining financial needs, and

If we exceed our goal, these funds will be used to continue to pay staff for menu development, stock the kitchen with equipment and smallwares, and open our doors! Every dollar donated will bring us closer to opening our doors and launching our programs. Our Mandate

</div></div>","Short Summary 
The project ""Casa da Ortigueira"", born in the year 2012 for the realization of a forestry



activities for the production of wood chips, together with fruit and vegetable products
including blueberries, pears, apples, horticultural products in general etc., as well as
farm activity combined with that of a cultural association dedicated to the
dissemination of concepts of self-sustainability, ecology and human well-being.
The business will be based in the town of Ortigueira (La Coruna- Spain), in the Galicia region
on a total area of about 25000 sqm.
The activity is based on the production of electricity from renewable sources,
seasonal fruit and vegetable production with biological methodology, homebrewed
beer and divulging activities through courses and seminars held by us or by renting
part of the property to a third party.

The food and homebrewed beer will be sold both in the accommodation of the farm, both on-site in a small store, either via web.
The reference market with regard to the sale of electricity is that public-state and self use; concerning selling of agricultural products is local within 30-50 km from the property (company store), as tourism is  most of all international (renting rooms with breakfast all seasons except for january and february), pilgrims walking or cycling on the “Santiago route” and the WEB.
 
The Team

<h2><b>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES:</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Internally,
the biggest and virtually only challenge we face currently is lack of capital.
Raising funds for non-profit organizations is both tedious and difficult. With
so many other great organizations out there, we hope you can see how we stand
out in not only our life-changing technologies, but the jobs and education we
will create throughout the world. </p>
<p><b>Domestically</b>
we face extremely expensive certification processes for all of our technologies
that create difficult hurdles for us that do not exist in other countries. </p>
<p><b>Abroad</b>
we face cultural challenges in that not every society is the same, nor do they
accept help as easily as we would think. </p>
<p>For
example, in South Africa, we cannot just go into a shack-dwelling community and
erect a bathroom block. We have to first consult with the elders of the
community (who hold all of the respect and decision making in the community)
and gain their acceptance of our help. Then they tell us where and when we can
deploy our buildings. Without this permission, our buildings would be destroyed
as soon as we erected them and our teams would be thrown out of the
communities. </p>
<p>Our
team consists of business professionals, engineers, and heads of foundations
that already have experience within the communities we aim to uplift. With
travel to over 140 countries around the world, members of our team have the
vast experience and knowledge of the differences in these cultures that are key
to the success of our project. </p>

CURRENTLY DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES:





OUR 1 BEDROOM TINY HOME PLAN:


SO WHY ARE WE DOING THIS FOR FREE? We live in an abundant world, yet we have set up a society that lives in scarcity... 

In the United States over 575,000 people are homeless.


Globally, 6 to 8
million people die annually from the consequences of disasters and

According
to the United Nations International Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 22,000 children around the world die EACH DAY due to poverty.


In
South Africa alone, 9 children die each day from fire related incidents.

Man created these problems. It is up to man to solve them. It is as simple as that. 
We have the tools, experience, and technology to end these problems. But we need your help. 
Our campaign aims to kick off a global effort in solving these and many more of the catastrophic problems faced by people all over the world.



  COMPLETE TECHNOLOGIES OVERVIEW:

Abroad we are currently focusing on the shack-dwelling impoverished communities of South Africa... where my story began.

Together we have been in the education field for over 20 years and look forward to sharing our expertise with the families of Collier and Lee counties. 
Launching First Step has been years in the making. Through partnerships with various community organizations we have developed a thorough business plan that accounts for every aspect of successful child care operation. 
 By offering 24 hour child care, we will fill a void in the lives of parents who are in need of safe, quality child care outside of the traditional hours of 9-5. Our center will offer an academically focused program that parents can depend on to provide trustworthy child care services when they need it most. 
 
Contributors to our campaign will help us bring quality, 24 hour child care to the families of Southwest Florida.

<p></p><p><b>The Story</b></p>
<p>In January 2014 I was working in a call center and I was
planning to be an entrepreneur by doing something that I really love to do.My passion
is about working with computers and technology. Later in February 2014, I quit my
job and started working on my own business. </p>
<p>I need to take action now! 
This is important to me!</p>
<p>I didn't have much capital and I wanted to make my dream
happen.</p>
<p>That was March 2014. At that time I did not have enough
money to get a good personal computer or laptop. </p>
<p>I borrowed about $26 from my mother and had some money of my
own and I went to an old monitor shop.  I
was trying to find a monitor that I can buy and work on. Later I managed
to buy a used CRT monitor $24.I went to another used computer shop to
find a cheap PC casing which I bought for $6.57 and built a computer with some
other parts that I had.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1184471/files/20150130081523-image_1.jpg?1422634523"" src="""" style=""width: 615.125px; height: 209px;""/></p><p>From the same old computer accessories shop I bought a used

But then I didn’t have
enough money to buy a table and a chair to put the Computer on.  I used to put my computer on one side of my bed
and I used to sleep on the other side. I was still happy! </p>
<p>I needed an internet connection but had no money for
that.  We ended up sharing a broadband
internet connection with 6 people in order to cut costs.</p>
<p>Then I needed an internet cable…  I was trying to manage everything as cheap as
possible. I went to a recycling shop.</p>
<p><span>While I was walking beside the

 outside exposed to moisture, temperature extremes and dust.  It creates the potential for electrical short circuits, corrosion and premature aging.</p>
<p>

<p>That's why we designed our light weight controller to be so

</div></div>","Our Story Two years ago, a simple yet not so common nowadays idea stuck in our minds: To create an online Barter marketplace! A community where anyone can trade goods and services in a simple, secure and user friendly space.
Myself (Yiannis Deliyiannis), George Karamanoglou and Michalis Pitsikalis, quit our day jobs and jumped into the abyss of the startup world!


On January 2013  tradenow was launched in Greece! A beta version with many ooops.. page not found! The whole project was at risk, technically speaking - because in terms of traction we signed on 5K members in our first 3 months! 
We regrouped, brought into the team a Senior developer (Dimitris) and redeveloped - redesigned the platform! We didn't give up our dream: To become the world's online Barter marketplace.
Today, almost 8 months in full operation, our barter community: 20K members and 400 companies have created a marketplace with goods, services and real-estate worth over €150ΜΜ.  
With over 1,000 completed transactions valued at €500Κ,  this  barter community has helped thousands of individuals save money and hundreds of companies  to build their network and utilize their excess capacity.

<p><b>Why is a newspaper important to rural communities</b><b>? </b></p>
<p>Rural communities face unique challenges that mainstream
news agencies do not address. </p>
<p>Our communities are
geographically wide spread, as well as politically, economically and culturally
diverse. Keeping abreast of local happenings and concerns is impossible without
a common source of information. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The
mission statement of The South Clark County Gazette is: </b></p>
<p>To unite our rural communities by sharing
information through fair and unbiased reporting of relevant events, issues and
opportunities. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p>A local paper <b>Improves
Quality of Life </b>in many ways </p>
<p><b>Creates
Community:</b> It strengthens the sense of community by building a bridge of
communication between neighbors. It's a vital source of reliable information,
and is very much the lifeblood of small communities. </p>
<p>The editors of The South
Clark County Gazette see the diversity of our communities as a strength and are
steadfastly committed to fair and unbiased reporting. We want to inspire unity
where possible and respectful acceptance of others, where opinions may be
divided. </p>
<p><b>Boosts
the Economy:</b> Our communities have numerous small businesses, as well as an
emerging Cottage Industry. The paper is the perfect medium to get the word out,
bringing customers and services or products together. Potentially creating even
more opportunities for local jobs and economic growth. </p>
<p>The South Clark County
Gazette will strongly support and promote all local enterprises, by
highlighting and publicizing their products and services. </p>
<p><b>Supports
the Children and Young Adults:</b> Student activities, events and achievements are
proudly celebrated and reported upon, in a local paper.</p>
<p>The SCCG has partnered
with our local public schools as well as the homeschool groups. We are also a
standing committee with Keystone Enrichment Foundation. A local non-profit,
whose purpose is to benefit the community through various events and
educational opportunities. Education and the success of our young people is a
vital concern. We want to improve our communities and create a better future
for everyone, but especially our children. <br/></p><p>
</p><p><b>Our communities have never had a

</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<div>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">In 2013 after researching projects that promoted the labor
market inclusion of people with disabilities we found out about El Café de las
Sonrisas (The Smiles Coffee Shop), a civil organization in Nicaragua that
promotes the social and labor inclusion of people with hearing impairments.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Since then we started putting up the project of a Coffee
Shop chain that besides supporting people with disabilities could also support other vulnerable sectors
(such as elderly people, homeless people and indigenous communities) by making partnerships with civil
organizations, government bodies and social enterprises.</p>
<p>In August 2013, we took part in a national contest at La
Semana del Emprendedor  (Entrepreneur
Week) that is organized by the INADEM (Mexican National Institute of
Entrepreneurs). We were awarded the first prize in our category, receiving  $95,000 MXN (~ $5,500 USD) to incubate and structure El Café de los
Sentidos (The Senses Coffee Shop) with professional
counseling from Feher &amp; Feher a  Mexican, highly recognized business incubator,
accelerator and consultancy.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b style=""background-color: initial;""></b></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;""><b>Specialty Coffee:</b></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Currently the price of coffee is determined by the stock
markets in New York and London. As a consequence the volatility of the prices
creates a high level of uncertainty for the coffee farmers .The “coyotes” and all sorts of
intermediates hog the coffee beans and prevent the farmers to benefit from a
higher price for their harvest. Furthermore, they sometimes are forced to sell their coffee at a loss.  </p>
<p>Specialty coffee represents only 5% to 10% of the worldwide
production, due to its high quality it allows farmers to directly receive an
income that can be 2 to 10 times higher than the one they  get in the mainstream coffee market.</p>
<p>We can thus guarantee:</p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">1)  A significantly higher income for coffee farmers</b><br/></p>

<p><b>Local Products: </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We believe that the best way to achieve a higher social

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;line-height: 30px;""><b>3) Partnerships and MUCAM</b></span></p>
<p>According to the CONAPRED (Mexican National Council to
Prevent Discrimination) in Mexico many people with disabilities, elderly people,
indigenous communities, young people as well as women are considered to be
vulnerable groups and frequently face employment discrimination. </p>
<p>This is the reason why we have established partnerships with
civil organizations and social enterprises that have the endeavor to foster the
development and the labor inclusion of
these sectors. These partnerships include organizations such as</p>
<p>1) Domus
Institute that supports people facing Autism Spectrum Disorders.</p>
<p>2) CEDAC Foundation that supports people with Down Syndrome. </p>
<p>3) CINIA a company that collaborates with more than 300 people with
disabilities and offers products and services of the highest quality. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span><b>MUCAM (COEXME group | Civil Organization)</b></span></p>
<p>Together with Luz María Ozuna, Director of the most
important coffee event in Latin America (Cumbre Latinoamericana del Café- Latin-American
Coffee Summit) and 5 other companies we established MUCAM, a non-profit organization
that promotes the export of produce manufactured by Mexican women and  female artisans.</p>
<p>With MUCAM, we have established strategic partnerships with
institutions, organizations and government bodies with which we have supported
different projects in Mexico as well as achieving a strong presence at
international events ( in Colombia, Italy, US and soon in the EU).</p>
<p>We have, at present, supported +30 companies with about $120,000
USD. </p>

<p>Unlike conventional companies, 60% of our profit will be permanently reinvested in social initiatives and social projects. <br/></p>
<p>With your support, we will be able to obtain 60% of the initial investment we need to open our first coffee shop.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;line-height: 30px;""><b><br/></b></span></p>
<p>El Café de los Sentidos was born 3 years ago with the aim of
reinvesting  in society.</p>
<p>With your support we will be able to open our first coffee
shop and permanently reinvest 60% of its profit in projects and social initiatives!  All of these projects will be put forward and
voted by you and a group of experts through local and national calls for proposals. Therefore, our main “partner” will be Society and that is
you! </p>
<p>The remaining 40% of our profit will be reinvested in new coffee shops working under the same
scheme. </p>
<p>Some of our goals in the medium and long term are: </p>
<p>1-<span> 
</span>To reinvest 20% to 90% of the profit of each Coffee Shop in
social initiatives and projects to have a major positive impact in our
society.</p>
<p>2-<span> 
</span>To enable our collaborators to develop their own personal social projects
with part of our reinvestment. </p>
<p>3-<span> 
</span>To allow our model to be replicated into
other sectors and traditional businesses in Mexico and worldwide (bakeries,
restaurants, tea houses etc).</p>
<p><b>With your support and by spreading the word we will secure
the remaining 60% that we need in order to open our very first  El Café de los Sentidos Coffee Shop! </b></p>

<h3><b>1) Nuestra Historia</b></h3>

<p>En la actualidad, los precios del café están determinados por las Bolsas de Valores de Nueva York y de Londres.

1) Our Story:


In 2013 after researching projects that promoted the labor
market inclusion of people with disabilities we found out about El Café de las
Sonrisas (The Smiles Coffee Shop), a civil organization in Nicaragua that
promotes the social and labor inclusion of people with hearing impairments.


Since then we started putting up the project of a Coffee
Shop chain that besides supporting people with disabilities could also support other vulnerable sectors
(such as elderly people, homeless people and indigenous communities) by making partnerships with civil
organizations, government bodies and social enterprises.
In August 2013, we took part in a national contest at La
Semana del Emprendedor  (Entrepreneur
Week) that is organized by the INADEM (Mexican National Institute of
Entrepreneurs). We were awarded the first prize in our category, receiving  $95,000 MXN (~ $5,500 USD) to incubate and structure El Café de los
Sentidos (The Senses Coffee Shop) with professional
counseling from Feher & Feher a  Mexican, highly recognized business incubator,
accelerator and consultancy.




2) What do we Offer:

Specialty Coffee:


Currently the price of coffee is determined by the stock
markets in New York and London. As a consequence the volatility of the prices
creates a high level of uncertainty for the coffee farmers .The “coyotes” and all sorts of
intermediates hog the coffee beans and prevent the farmers to benefit from a
higher price for their harvest. Furthermore, they sometimes are forced to sell their coffee at a loss.  
Specialty coffee represents only 5% to 10% of the worldwide
production, due to its high quality it allows farmers to directly receive an
income that can be 2 to 10 times higher than the one they  get in the mainstream coffee market.
We can thus guarantee:
1)  A significantly higher income for coffee farmers
2)  A premium quality coffee for our clients. 


Local Products: 
We believe that the best way to achieve a higher social
impact is by collaborating with civil organizations as well as  local companies that are already creating
benefits for our society. 
In our Coffee Shops you will  find:



3) Partnerships and MUCAM
According to the CONAPRED (Mexican National Council to
Prevent Discrimination) in Mexico many people with disabilities, elderly people,
indigenous communities, young people as well as women are considered to be
vulnerable groups and frequently face employment discrimination. 
This is the reason why we have established partnerships with
civil organizations and social enterprises that have the endeavor to foster the
development and the labor inclusion of
these sectors. These partnerships include organizations such as
1) Domus
Institute that supports people facing Autism Spectrum Disorders.
2) CEDAC Foundation that supports people with Down Syndrome. 
3) CINIA a company that collaborates with more than 300 people with
disabilities and offers products and services of the highest quality. 



MUCAM (COEXME group | Civil Organization)
Together with Luz María Ozuna, Director of the most
important coffee event in Latin America (Cumbre Latinoamericana del Café- Latin-American
Coffee Summit) and 5 other companies we established MUCAM, a non-profit organization
that promotes the export of produce manufactured by Mexican women and  female artisans.
With MUCAM, we have established strategic partnerships with
institutions, organizations and government bodies with which we have supported
different projects in Mexico as well as achieving a strong presence at
international events ( in Colombia, Italy, US and soon in the EU).
We have, at present, supported +30 companies with about $120,000
USD. 




4) How will the money be used?



Unlike conventional companies, 60% of our profit will be permanently reinvested in social initiatives and social projects. 
With your support, we will be able to obtain 60% of the initial investment we need to open our first coffee shop.
The appeal shall be distributed as follows:



5) Why is your support so important?

El Café de los Sentidos was born 3 years ago with the aim of
reinvesting  in society.
With your support we will be able to open our first coffee
shop and permanently reinvest 60% of its profit in projects and social initiatives!  All of these projects will be put forward and
voted by you and a group of experts through local and national calls for proposals. Therefore, our main “partner” will be Society and that is
you! 
The remaining 40% of our profit will be reinvested in new coffee shops working under the same
scheme. 
Some of our goals in the medium and long term are: 
1- 
To reinvest 20% to 90% of the profit of each Coffee Shop in
social initiatives and projects to have a major positive impact in our
society.
2- 
To enable our collaborators to develop their own personal social projects
with part of our reinvestment. 
3- 
To allow our model to be replicated into
other sectors and traditional businesses in Mexico and worldwide (bakeries,
restaurants, tea houses etc).
With your support and by spreading the word we will secure
the remaining 60% that we need in order to open our very first  El Café de los Sentidos Coffee Shop!

<p>In the 1970’s the World
learned to recycle plastics.  By doing
so, one of our main sources of fuel for our power plants was no longer viable
and as a result, more &amp; more fossil fuels were needed to burn in our power
plants!  </p>
<p> In 2016 World Leaders came together in Davos
Switzerland to talk about Climate issues. 
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation produced a Chilling report dealing with
the “Plastic Soup” in the ocean.  The
report stated that, “by 2050, There will be more plastic in the Oceans than
Fish”.  A Nightmare for the World, but
there are Lifelines for our ravaged Oceans, with Initiatives like “The Clean Sea
Project” (<a href=""http://www.cleansea-project.eu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cleansea-project.eu</a>)
and “The Ocean Clean-Up” (<a href=""http://www.theoceancleanup.com/problem"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.theoceancleanup.com/problem</a>),
which work tireless to educate &amp; resolve this issue. </p>
<p>Happy Panda believes that
BIO plastics are the Future!  Bio
plastics like PLA biodegrade within 10-24 months in the environment saving our
Oceans countless acres of Plastic soup! 
BioPlastics are 100% recyclable &amp; reusable! </p>

<p><b>Our story...</b><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>While visiting the United
States in 2013 our founder Eduardus Groenewegen was introduced to Chris McKenna
a U.S. Navy veteran who, with the help of his wife Sarah, wanted to make a
difference.  They were producing &amp;
selling Biodegradable drink cups made from Bamboo resin.  Intrigued, Eduardus became friends with the McKenna’s
and took a case of their Bamboo cups back to his native Holland. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455642435/byixxnqhc2oyubsnhkys.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">After introducing the Bamboo cups to his
friends &amp; colleagues, Eduardus was dismayed by the public’s lack of
knowledge on biodegradable disposables. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">With
the help of the Dutch government, Eduardus opened an Eco Awareness café called
Happy Panda in Amsterdam.  His unique
storefront was part University &amp; part Marketplace where he sold recycled
products &amp; Bio degradable merchandise from all over the world.  They would offer introductions to
environmental problems along with possible solutions.  </span></p>

<p>With the understanding that
any real true Change, first begins with education.  Happy Panda has begun gathering information
on not only Bio Degradable plastics such as PLA or POLY (Polylactic acid or
Polylactide).  - Which is thermoplastic
aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources, such as Corn Starch
(North America), Tapioca Roots, Chips or Starch (Asia) and Sugarcane
(World).  - But, also on initiatives like
The Clean Sea Project &amp; The Ocean Clean-up Project.  Happy Panda is introducing Eco Friendly
plastics to people &amp; companies whom were never educated or introduced to
them.  Who have begun their own path to a
greener tomorrow! </p>

<p>-- A new report on dealing with the plastic soup was presented at the World Economic Forum, where world leaders came together from 20 to 23 January 2016, in Davos. <em>New Plastics Economy</em> was produced by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in collaboration with an impressive number of companies and institutes.                <a href=""http://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/assets/downloads/EllenMacArthurFoundation_NewPlasticsEconomy_26-1-2016.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The report</a> highlights the gravity of plastic pollution – “in 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the sea” – and notes that it is primarily plastic packaging that is the culprit.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455700280/zs9hf9ksgvuhblvowxiq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The report’s premise is simple. Plastic has multiple advantages such as improved food safety and lower transport costs and is therefore indispensable. Of all the plastic packaging, 95% is lost to the economy after use. This represents a loss of 80 to 120 billion dollars. As much of that plastic ends up in the environment and has caused and continues to contribute to the plastic soup, this generates even more costs. The <em>New Plastics Economy</em> must stimulate change by viewing more plastics as a basic resource and keeping it in the economic system. The disposable economy needs to rapidly turn into the circular economy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455700436/ophwxznnq20utki3khzf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The proposed solution is <em>not</em> to dramatically reduce plastics, but to take a three pronged approach. One, processing facilities for plastic waste in the countries which contribute significantly to the plastic soup – primarily in Asia – need to be improved. Two, and of greater importance, the researchers propose to make plastic waste more economically attractive. And finally, three, the material itself needs to be improved. Plastics need to be developed which, once in the marine environment, cause less damage.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455701129/yzycqt6felonddbtyskm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>One fundamental problem of the proposed solution is that a higher economic value for plastic waste is unrealistic. Almost all plastic is made of fossil fuels and the current price of 30 dollars a barrel is a historic low. The continuously low oil price pushes the production costs of plastic down. The result is a spike in the production of plastic with even more uses found. The value of plastic waste will thus not increase, but actually decrease. Each product, for example, could be packaged three times in plastic without significant additional costs. Recycling companies around the world are going bankrupt.</p>

The Problem...

The World is DROWNING in an
Ocean of Plastic!  Dramatic and
Unimaginable yes, but true, and the truth, is far scarier then you will ever be
told!  




In the 1970’s the World
learned to recycle plastics.  By doing
so, one of our main sources of fuel for our power plants was no longer viable
and as a result, more & more fossil fuels were needed to burn in our power
plants!  
 In 2016 World Leaders came together in Davos
Switzerland to talk about Climate issues. 
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation produced a Chilling report dealing with
the “Plastic Soup” in the ocean.  The
report stated that, “by 2050, There will be more plastic in the Oceans than
Fish”.  A Nightmare for the World, but
there are Lifelines for our ravaged Oceans, with Initiatives like “The Clean Sea
Project” (www.cleansea-project.eu)
and “The Ocean Clean-Up” (www.theoceancleanup.com/problem),
which work tireless to educate & resolve this issue. 
Happy Panda believes that
BIO plastics are the Future!  Bio
plastics like PLA biodegrade within 10-24 months in the environment saving our
Oceans countless acres of Plastic soup! 
BioPlastics are 100% recyclable & reusable!

Our story...

While visiting the United
States in 2013 our founder Eduardus Groenewegen was introduced to Chris McKenna
a U.S. Navy veteran who, with the help of his wife Sarah, wanted to make a
difference.  They were producing &
selling Biodegradable drink cups made from Bamboo resin.  Intrigued, Eduardus became friends with the McKenna’s
and took a case of their Bamboo cups back to his native Holland. 

After introducing the Bamboo cups to his
friends & colleagues, Eduardus was dismayed by the public’s lack of
knowledge on biodegradable disposables. 
With
the help of the Dutch government, Eduardus opened an Eco Awareness café called
Happy Panda in Amsterdam.  His unique
storefront was part University & part Marketplace where he sold recycled
products & Bio degradable merchandise from all over the world.  They would offer introductions to
environmental problems along with possible solutions.  


Eduardus Groenewegen at his test store in amsterdam.

Happy Panda started a revolution where concerts, festivals and bars are now using & promoting Biodegradable disposables. 




Eduardus came back to the
United States in 2014 and with the support of the McKenna’s, set out to make
Happy Panda a Global phenomenon, by becoming the Worlds “Eco Awareness
Pioneers!” 



Chris wants his legacy to be one his children (including new born boy, Spencer) and grand children can enjoy (as does Ed) after he left this earth.

With the understanding that
any real true Change, first begins with education.  Happy Panda has begun gathering information
on not only Bio Degradable plastics such as PLA or POLY (Polylactic acid or
Polylactide).  - Which is thermoplastic
aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources, such as Corn Starch
(North America), Tapioca Roots, Chips or Starch (Asia) and Sugarcane
(World).  - But, also on initiatives like
The Clean Sea Project & The Ocean Clean-up Project.  Happy Panda is introducing Eco Friendly
plastics to people & companies whom were never educated or introduced to
them.  Who have begun their own path to a
greener tomorrow! 






3rd from left: Eduardus Groenewegen with 2nd from right: Gerry Martin at Ripley County, Indiana, environmental meeting.

Ed discussed his findings with Melissa and Gerry and Karl Lapan (of the Northeast Indiana Innovation Center, formed in December 1999 as a private-public partnership between the City of Ft. Wayne, IPFW, the County of Allen, the Greater Fort Wayne Chamber of Commerce, and local community stakeholders). These discussions lead to the conclusion that the backbone of Happy Panda USA Corp. should be the single use bio-plastic disposables indeed. The designers where put to work and the first type cold drink cup to be made from PLA plastic was born. 



This is where this campaign comes in:
In order to work towards our ultimate goal of making a difference in the plastic industry regarding replacing petrol based plastics with renewable, recyclable bio degradable plastics we need YOUR help!
YOUR contribution to our project will kick-start production and sales. We already have found a contract manufacturing partner in ROCKLEIGH INDUSTRIES in order to produce our own brand, make and model cold drink cups and more.

Here is What We Need & What You GetTo ensure a descent start right of the bat, we need a 50.000 pcs sample batch worth 5000 usd. Up to 20,000 usd is needed for marketing, sales, travel, office, equipment and running costs for the first 6 months upon delivery of the sample batch. 
Become part of the ECO awareness team that is Happy Panda USA Corp. by becoming a contributor and receive an unforgettable one of a kind incentive. 



Ranging from limited edition cold drink cups to personalized cold drink cups and awesome T-shirts.




Happy Panda USA Corp. is no stranger to working on tight budgets. Eduardus (like Christopher) has used his little private funds to get us where we are today. In case we may not reach our funding goal we will be able to order a sample batch of 1000 pcs for as little as 1100 usd per model (startup and mold costs) and work from there.  Why did we form Happy Panda, the ECO awareness pioneers?



-- A new report on dealing with the plastic soup was presented at the World Economic Forum, where world leaders came together from 20 to 23 January 2016, in Davos. New Plastics Economy was produced by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in collaboration with an impressive number of companies and institutes.                The report highlights the gravity of plastic pollution – “in 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the sea” – and notes that it is primarily plastic packaging that is the culprit.


The report’s premise is simple. Plastic has multiple advantages such as improved food safety and lower transport costs and is therefore indispensable. Of all the plastic packaging, 95% is lost to the economy after use. This represents a loss of 80 to 120 billion dollars. As much of that plastic ends up in the environment and has caused and continues to contribute to the plastic soup, this generates even more costs. The New Plastics Economy must stimulate change by viewing more plastics as a basic resource and keeping it in the economic system. The disposable economy needs to rapidly turn into the circular economy.


The proposed solution is not to dramatically reduce plastics, but to take a three pronged approach. One, processing facilities for plastic waste in the countries which contribute significantly to the plastic soup – primarily in Asia – need to be improved. Two, and of greater importance, the researchers propose to make plastic waste more economically attractive. And finally, three, the material itself needs to be improved. Plastics need to be developed which, once in the marine environment, cause less damage.


One fundamental problem of the proposed solution is that a higher economic value for plastic waste is unrealistic. Almost all plastic is made of fossil fuels and the current price of 30 dollars a barrel is a historic low. The continuously low oil price pushes the production costs of plastic down. The result is a spike in the production of plastic with even more uses found. The value of plastic waste will thus not increase, but actually decrease. Each product, for example, could be packaged three times in plastic without significant additional costs. Recycling companies around the world are going bankrupt.

What is most needed is to strongly restrict the unbridled production of single use plastic. By creating scarcity, you can increase the value of plastic waste. Unfortunately, the companies consulted for this report are unwilling to discuss production limitation. This is the simple reason that this option is not mentioned in the report at all. --                                                             

                                                           (source: http://www.plasticsoupfoundation.org/en)  We could not say it better ourselves, but we did come to this conclusion years before this report came to light and thus Happy Panda was born.
The combined knowledge, expertise, qualities, drive and sense of responsibility regarding our planet's environment towards our (and YOUR) children makes the Happy Panda ECO awareness team a WINNING team!     

                                          
The challenges we face....
We realize that it would be utterly naive to think we will change the way the world's plastics industry and inhabitants operate, think and live without some challenges and/or risks. But we ARE committed to spread ECO awareness and replace regular plastics for BIO plastics on a COMMERCIAL scale!



The Happy Panda team will use its very broad skill set to ensure victory in the short, medium and long term. We wil gather intelligence on products, markets, competition and demographics, analyse that intelligence, form a plan of attack and surprise the world with our products and vision, one city, one county, one state, one country and one continent at a time.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Chrishella Roché is a Milwaukee native, raised in the Sherman Park community. Always having a passion for youth involvement, she decided to study education and received my degree in Elementary Education from Alabama State University. She brought the skills she learned back to Milwaukee and taught K-4th grade students. While in the classroom, she noticed that students (even at a young age) were trying to manage anxiety, depression, and societal pressures to be the ""perfect scholar"". This saddened her and she wanted to take a break from teaching because she felt like there was something more she could do. She took some time to live and continue teaching but this time abroad and she noticed children all over were dealing with some of the same issues but managing them differently. She observed different coping techniques that were encouraged, practiced, and utilized them in her personal life and with her students. Some of the most common techniques she noticed was painting, poetry, meditation, and music. </p>
<p>During her time abroad (August of 2016) community frustrations boiled over in her hometown resulting in civil unrest in Milwaukee's Sherman Park Neighborhood. Multiple businesses were burned down. The riots in Milwaukee had become breaking news! She saw her community hurting and crying out for help. Afterwards she noticed that their was a community that needed healing and a safe space to release thoughts, feelings, and emotions but there was no outlet within reach. That's when Vibez Creative Arts Space was created.</p>
<p>She decided to come back home (Milwaukee) and instead of going back into the traditional classroom, she created my own ""Classroom"". ""At Vibez, I want youth and adults to learn different techniques to express themselves so that we don't have to experience another Sherman Park (or Milwaukee) uprising.Over the years, I recognized in myself that poetry, painting , and music allowed me to focus, express myself, as well as heal. Vibez creative arts space was created to give the community that same safe space, the same outlet that I had used to find peace."" - Chrishella Roché</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3><strong>MISSION</strong></h3><p>Our mission is to build upon the peace agreement in Colombia, by creating a Solidarity Revolving Fund (SRF) which will be an essential tool to economically support small territorial cooperatives of the ex-combatants of the FARC-EP (Revolutionary Armed Forces from Colombia, People´s Army) in Colombia. Currently, we, the former guerrilla fighters have put down our weapons, and we are now starting cooperatives and productive projects as the main strategy for our social and economic reincorporation. In this way, we want to strengthen solidarity economies as well as the process of reincorporation of ex-combatants – both essential developments for long-lasting peace in the country.</p><h3><strong>OUR PROJECT: “PEACE CO-OPS”</strong></h3><p>In order to create alternative livelihoods for ex-combatants and peasants, it is of crucial importance to strengthening local and solidarity economies.</p><p>Objective 1: To create and implement a Solidarity Revolving Fund (SRF) managed by ECOMUN.</p><p>Objective 2: To support and give the initial impulse to some territorial cooperatives by offering affordable loans.</p><h3><strong>BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE ARMED CONFLICT IN COLOMBIA</strong></h3><p>Colombia has suffered for decades from a violent armed conflict resulting in more than 300.000 people killed, 50.000 people missing, and more than 7.000.000 people displaced. Many claim that (international) interests regarding land and resources are the very core of the conflict. In November of 2016, a peace agreement was finally signed between the Colombian government and our rebel group FARC-EP, ending a 52-year armed conflict. The peace deal included the agreement: Comprehensive Agrarian Reform, which involves the implementation of a mixed development model based on one hand, on the sustaining of the traditional agroindustry and on the other hand, the strengthening of the peasant, indigenous, and Afro-Colombian economies to ensure living conditions for the majority of the population. The agreement states that solidarity economy is one of the major strategies to be developed in a peacebuilding stage, not only to support and enhance peasant economy but also as a strategy of social and economic reincorporation of ex-combatants.</p><h3><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></h3><p>Yet, while the FARC-EP handed over their weapons, there are still many challenges in the current stage of peacebuilding in the country. <strong>First</strong>, the peace agreement is not enough to establish peace, there are many threats from the traditional “enemies of the peace” who are still damaging the social movement and killing social leaders and ex-combatants. Just when we were writing these lines on the 30 of August of this year (2018), more than 270 social leaders and near to 80 members of the new political party FARC (Alternative Revolutionary Force of Colombia) have been assassinated in different places of Colombia since the signature of the peace agreement in 2016. An ex-combatant of the FARC describes his current situation:</p><p style=""margin-left:36.0pt;"">There are thousands of ex-combatants, who were fighting against a corrupt government that was selling land to foreign Trans National Companies. Paramilitaries came to kill <i>campesinos</i>, (peasant farmers) clear the land and start plantations of banana, African palm oil and other products for export. Now that fight continues in our political party and us, ex-combatants need to integrate again into society. This is very challenging since we have to learn new skills and find a place where people want to hire us. Our dream is to create our own work and practice what we preach: work on a solidarity economy on land for the people of Colombia.”</p><p>A <strong>second</strong> problem is the problem of the coca crops for illegal use. On October 5th, 2017, the police opened fire on unarmed peasants in Tumaco, Colombia. Eight were killed, dozens more were injured. The massacre was part of a crackdown on coca farmers in the “War On Drugs”, despite an agreement for crop substitution. One of the young guys who got shot in his knee explains:</p><p style=""margin-left:36.0pt;"">They should stop this and bring a solution for the people. The soldiers and the police say the eradication will continue until they dismantle every coca plantation in this area.  But they haven’t come here with any projects or loans for the sowing of plantains or cassava, not a single project has been proposed here. There’s no solution for peasants. The only ‘solution’ they bring is eradication, and that’s all.</p><p style=""margin-left:36.0pt;"">(…) We are marginalized, we have no help and everything is abandoned here. There are no schools, medical centres or electricity, no roads. Our needs are based on the poverty around here. If you grow plantains, there are no means to take it out for sale. If you plant cassava, who will buy it? So then how can we make a living? The people of the coca come here and we live from it. The government basically have abandoned us.

Currently, we, the former guerrilla fighters have put down our weapons, and we are now starting cooperatives and productive projects as the main strategy for our social and economic reincorporation. In this way, we want to strengthen solidarity economies as well as the process of reincorporation of ex-combatants – both essential developments for long-lasting peace in the country.OUR PROJECT: “PEACE CO-OPS”In order to create alternative livelihoods for ex-combatants and peasants, it is of crucial importance to strengthening local and solidarity economies.Objective 1: To create and implement a Solidarity Revolving Fund (SRF) managed by ECOMUN.Objective 2: To support and give the initial impulse to some territorial cooperatives by offering affordable loans.BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE ARMED CONFLICT IN COLOMBIAColombia has suffered for decades from a violent armed conflict resulting in more than 300.000 people killed, 50.000 people missing, and more than 7.000.000 people displaced. Many claim that (international) interests regarding land and resources are the very core of the conflict. In November of 2016, a peace agreement was finally signed between the Colombian government and our rebel group FARC-EP, ending a 52-year armed conflict. The peace deal included the agreement: Comprehensive Agrarian Reform, which involves the implementation of a mixed development model based on one hand, on the sustaining of the traditional agroindustry and on the other hand, the strengthening of the peasant, indigenous, and Afro-Colombian economies to ensure living conditions for the majority of the population. The agreement states that solidarity economy is one of the major strategies to be developed in a peacebuilding stage, not only to support and enhance peasant economy but also as a strategy of social and economic reincorporation of ex-combatants.THE PROBLEMYet, while the FARC-EP handed over their weapons, there are still many challenges in the current stage of peacebuilding in the country. First, the peace agreement is not enough to establish peace, there are many threats from the traditional “enemies of the peace” who are still damaging the social movement and killing social leaders and ex-combatants. Just when we were writing these lines on the 30 of August of this year (2018), more than 270 social leaders and near to 80 members of the new political party FARC (Alternative Revolutionary Force of Colombia) have been assassinated in different places of Colombia since the signature of the peace agreement in 2016. An ex-combatant of the FARC describes his current situation:There are thousands of ex-combatants, who were fighting against a corrupt government that was selling land to foreign Trans National Companies. Paramilitaries came to kill campesinos, (peasant farmers) clear the land and start plantations of banana, African palm oil and other products for export. Now that fight continues in our political party and us, ex-combatants need to integrate again into society. This is very challenging since we have to learn new skills and find a place where people want to hire us. Our dream is to create our own work and practice what we preach: work on a solidarity economy on land for the people of Colombia.”A second problem is the problem of the coca crops for illegal use. On October 5th, 2017, the police opened fire on unarmed peasants in Tumaco, Colombia. Eight were killed, dozens more were injured. The massacre was part of a crackdown on coca farmers in the “War On Drugs”, despite an agreement for crop substitution. One of the young guys who got shot in his knee explains:They should stop this and bring a solution for the people. The soldiers and the police say the eradication will continue until they dismantle every coca plantation in this area.  But they haven’t come here with any projects or loans for the sowing of plantains or cassava, not a single project has been proposed here. There’s no solution for peasants. The only ‘solution’ they bring is eradication, and that’s all.(…) We are marginalized, we have no help and everything is abandoned here. There are no schools, medical centres or electricity, no roads. Our needs are based on the poverty around here. If you grow plantains, there are no means to take it out for sale. If you plant cassava, who will buy it? So then how can we make a living? The people of the coca come here and we live from it. The government basically have abandoned us. They send the army and the police. They make us run away in the wild firing their guns, what can we do? Nothing.(…) We continue cultivating this crop because there are no other means to survive. For example, with plantain, you barely get to cover the costs! If the government helped us, we would leave this crop and plant something else. With coca we didn’t have any savings, but we could get by, and now? The government is leaving all of this destroyed, and we see no hope that we can survive this.” (theempirefiles.tv )The substitution of crops is really a good strategy for restoring the environment after the war consequences. We believe in the support to small farmers to get over the traditional economy of the coca crops but not neither in the repression policies nor in fumigation. Imprisonment of coca leave producers increases the social conflict and fumigation only destroys nature and precludes food production.Third, the gap between the poor and the rich in Colombia is still one of the biggest in the world. Generating more equity and dignity for all is our main goal. And fourth, our society has been a victim of a huge media and ideological campaign. Throughout history, this has caused hatred towards democratic and progressive political forces, hampering the process of reconciliation and peacebuilding.
A SPECIFIC CHALLENGE: BUILDING A SOLIDARITY ECONOMY AND SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTIVE PROJECTS. 
Figure 1. Ex-insurgents of the cooperative in San Pacho, Antioquia in a workshop offered by ECOMUNin addition to these specific problems, there is a big challenge in creating successful ways of guaranteeing sustainable livelihoods of ex-combatants and peasants who are living in former conflict zones. The proposed strategy is based on the strengthening of solidarity economy processes, specifically in the development of productive projects through peasants and ex-insurgents’ cooperatives. Currently, Social Economies of the Common, ECOMUN is the leading cooperative and has three business lines: Self-Sufficient Comprehensive Farms, Fishery and Agritourism.Figure 2. Colection of eggs in Carrizal, Antioquia.These lines are being developed in the different territories through small cooperatives which will be associated to ECOMUN as the second level organization. At this moment near to 70 cooperatives are already set up in about 40 territories, involving around 3500 ex-combatants in which close to 25% are women. These cooperatives also involve afro Colombian, indigenous and handicap population. There are around 80 productive initiatives in different sectors, like culture, farming, tourism, sports, communication and arts. Our challenge is to create different solidarity economy projects that can foster the development of an alternative economy in the territories.Figure 3. Breeding of chickens by the territorial cooperative in Carrizal, AntioquiaFigure 4. The manufacture cooperative is now producing men´s wear in Bogotá.However, we have identified different troubles in this process. To give a few examples:
Most of the cooperatives are lacking land for their productive projects. Without land we cannot develop agricultural projects! Despite the commitments acquired by the Colombian government in the peace agreement, the policy of redistribution of land among poor and landless peasants does not start and it seems that the new far-right government has a little compromise in this regard. Accessing to land via bank loans is still unavailable. Until now, there is not a policy for ex-combatants to access loans offered by formal banks, we cannot give guarantees, we cannot fulfill risk evaluations, and in general, interest rates in banks are unaffordable for peasants and cooperatives.
Entering to a competitive market with conventional products under extreme conditions like farms very far from market centres, high prices of agricultural inputs and extremely low prices for the products —often even below the cost of production— is another common problem.
The process of legalization of cooperatives is a big challenge since it requires, for example, to write statutes with more than 30 pages and a lot of documents which can be difficult for people with low literacy; creating and managing a cooperative business requires specific knowledge, essential for its management, which cannot be acquired in a short period of time.
Figure 5. Capacity building workshop organized by the educational committee of ECOMUN in San Francisco, SantanderThus, the solidarity economy project as a peacebuilding strategy is not as easy as we could suppose.To tackle these problems, we propose different alternatives: Firstly, we need access to land in an autonomous way and as soon as possible. Fortunately, in some places, we have received the solidarity from peasant, indigenous and Afro Colombian communities who, despite their own conditions, have shared some land with us.

In that sense, we really believe in mainly supporting a self-sufficiency economy in our territorial cooperatives. It means to support agroecological practices and the Self-Sufficient Comprehensive Farm model in which we can basically guarantee the living conditions of our associates and leave some products for the local market. Third, to build capacities among ex-combatants and peasants that can increase the likelihood of building successful cooperatives, making them more knowledgeable in issues regarding management, communication, marketing and organization among other skills and recognizing and keeping their current valuable knowledge in farming production and communitarian leadership.Figure 6.

Agricultural inputs.
Seeds.
Agricultural infrastructure.
Agricultural Machinery.
Machinery in general.
Transportation.

Originally starting as PNW Cupcakes (and later Pacific Northwest Cupcakes, before our final change to Grain), I have always had a passion for cooking and baking with whole ingredients, while supporting sustainable agriculture and local small farmers and businesses. While I started with baking for friends and family, I have grown to serve my clients and fans through farmers markets, pop ups, pairings, custom orders, and weddings. The relationships I have made with not only the local farmers and businesses I source from, but also my clients, are what fuels my fire to continue serving our community with entirely sustainably and locally sourced pastries and cakes. The young Midwest born and raised mom who went to school for political science policy and energy sustainability policy and competed dressage for the NAJYRC, is now finding herself and her passion in the world of pastry. Funny how the world works, isn't it? </p><h2>A Bit About Grain</h2><p>Grain brings baking back down to the fundamentals, gathering only the locally-sourced, sustainably-harvested, organically-grown, highest-quality ingredients to bring clients the experience of gorgeous desserts that are packed full of exquisite flavor profiles and luxurious textures, crafted carefully by an artisan’s hands. Without the use of preservatives, artificial flavoring, food dyes, or fondant, as Grain owner and pastry chef, I craft one of a kind, nature-inspired, flavorful desserts for clients craving a sustainable-minded bakery that value ingredient sourcing and sustainable agriculture, without sacrificing taste. Blending seasonal bounty with herbs and edible floral notes, many of Grain’s most popular flavors are far from chocolate and vanilla. As well as offering some of the best traditionally-baked pastries around, we pride ourselves in our decadent gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan and paleo options which have captured the hearts of diet-friendly clients from Everett to Issaquah and beyond. We are known for our commitment to using only local and sustainable ingredients, lending to our strong partnerships with small local farmers and our loyal clients who continue coming back for orders because of the high end pastries we serve.</p><p>Be sure to check out the feature video that we had filmed last year, as well as the gallery of photos of our work!</p><h2>The Significance of Community Support in Our Journey</h2><p>As we are collecting bakery equipment and tools, submitting permits and licenses, and working with numerous contractors, loan assistants, business coaches, and fellow pastry friends, we need the community's support to continue our journey. As a young, single mom, with limited resources, I have successfully grown Grain from a hobby to a catering business operating out of a commissary kitchen. However, the cost of starting a brick and mortar bakery (or restaurant) from a blank slate space isn't pennies; I am currently working with Ventures Non-Profit based in Seattle for my business builder loan of $35,000, but the estimated cost of build out and equipment is around $42,000, and we'd like to preferably have a buffer for construction issues bound to come up (they always do!) and to provide the perks of supporting us. The opening of this brick and mortar will allow me to: spend more time with my son; bake in the early hours, which allows daily pre-orders; sell at more farmers markets; take on more custom orders, and on shorter timelines; have a pick-up location that is open daily for normal regular hours; and more. Without the opening of our brick and mortar, Grain will likely not be able to continue growth, as we have exceeded our availability at our commissary. Our ever-supportive and loving community of clients, friends and family have been supportive in every step of our journey (including making us the top grossing non-produce vendor at the Snohomish Farmers Market last year!), and we know that with your continued support and sharing of our campaign with your friends, family and colleagues, we will not only open a brick and mortar, but we will become greater Seattle's favorite sustainably-minded, wholesome (and delicious!) bakery!</p><h2>The Addition of a Locally-Sourced Market</h2><p>In addition to the bakery, we will serve local and organic teas, local and organic coffees, high quality, sustainable gelato, and our favorite announcement - a mini market! Grain Artisan Bakery + Market will showcase to and allow our community to purchase the same local, sustainable, organic ingredients we use in convenient, residential-sized portions! We will also be offering some local artisan goods as well! Some of the local businesses you'll see in the Market:</p><ul>
<li>Grace Harbor Farms (whole milk, buttermilk, yogurt, goat milk, and to-go sizes of plain and chocolate whole milk)</li>
<li>Silvana (raw whole milk)</li>
<li>Skylight Farms (local organic pastured chicken eggs)</li>
<li>Field to Heart (local organic edible flowers, as well as bouquets!)</li>
<li>Small's Family Farms (local sustainable flours)</li>
<li>Bluebird Grain Farms (local organic heirloom grains)</li>
<li>Manini's (local gluten-free flours and local handmade gluten-free pastas)</li>
<li>La Pasta (local handmade pastas and sauces)</li>
<li>Frontier Flyers (local raw honey)</li>
<li>Land of the Living Apothecary (local, high quality essential oils and apothecary goods)</li>
<li>an assortment of dye-free sprinkles and food colorings</li>
<li>and lots more local, sustainable, organic groceries and household goods!</li>
</ul><h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2><p>To continue our well-known trait of transparency, we want you to know EXACTLY what our community's support will help attain. We need a total (including our small business loan and owner equity) of nearly $45,000 to make this brick and mortar happen, and we're a bit short! Here is a list of the expenses that will be covered under the capital required:</p><ul>
<li>Deposit on the space, as well as first and second month's rent</li>
<li>Snohomish County Bakery Permit License, Field Plan Review</li>
<li>Snohomish City License</li>
<li>Two Snohomish County Farmers Market Permits (Snohomish Thursdays 3-7p, and Mill Creek Fridays 12-5p!)</li>

<li>Marketing materials (printed on our signature 100% cotton paper with plant based biomass inks)</li>
<li>Buildout (general contractor, electrician, plumber, and zoning permits)</li>
<li>Equipment (oven(s), proofer, fridge, freezer, three basin sink, hand sink, prep sink, mop sink, dishwasher, grease trap, food processor, 20 quart mixer, 10 quart mixer, butcher block tables, storage bins, speed racks, induction stove tops, scales, immersion blender, torch, deep fryer(s), full sheet pans, half sheet pans, extra shelves, dough divider, sheeter, bread materials, and SO MUCH MORE!)</li>
</ul><p>And here are some things we'd really, really like to fund as our stretch-goals after our capital goals are met:</p><ul>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Dave and I want to build a community: a place where people gather to enjoy good company, good times, and good beer. I started Wingwalker Brewing on a shoestring budget with memories of all the lost ""local"" places where I loved to go. Because of permit and construction delays (which cost a lot of money), I need your help to get Wingwalker off the ground. Your contributions will help make this brewery a reality, and build a place where everyone feels welcome.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $50,000. That's a lot of money. The funds will go towards completing construction and purchasing brewing equipment. Specifically, the money will purchase a plate chiller, buy and install a glycol chiller system (to lager our brews), and create an outdoor patio. That is what you are helping to buy with your generosity.</p>
<p>To thank you for your gift, we have stickers, coasters, sustainable cotton t-shirts, and glassware. We have also created a VERY special perk with out partners at the ceramic studio Clay Arts Vegas. They have agreed to create one-of-a-kind ceramic steins as a special thank-you gift exclusively for this campaign. This perk will take a bit longer to deliver than the other ones, but it will be totally worth the wait!</p>
<p>As a special bonus, we offer a brew-it-yourself perk: a brewing session on our pilot system with your own recipe. If you have an idea for the best beer ever or if you and your home-brewing friends want to try out a professional all-grain system, this is your chance. If you are in Southern California, you can come to the brewery in person and we will help you create your masterpiece on our pilot system. If you can't get here, we will brew a batch to your recipe.  You can even name your brew!</p>
<p>Every little bit helps. Each dollar gets us closer to opening with the gear we need and the space we want. Whatever we raise will go towards making Wingwalker a great place to call home.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Wingwalker Brewing is going to be much more than a place to get good beer. Our goal is to create a community that supports, includes, and welcomes everyone. We will have family-friendly games and activities, many non-alcoholic options, plenty of delicacies from food trucks and local restaurant deliveries, and we will always support our community and our people. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks with any new business. You have to build your customer base; you have to overcome regulations and uncertain economic times; you always have to make sure you create a safe and secure workplace; and, you have to make money.  We can get the word out. We can publicize and advertise and socialize until the walls come down but that won't do us any good unless we make beer that is good enough to justify the hype. This campaign is about getting all the gear to make the best beer. Good Beer, Good Vibes, and Good Times will help us minimize the risks.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Times are hard and many people want to help out but can't right now. That's OK. You can still help us out by sharing this campaign on your social media and blogs. We're very friendly and we want to welcome everyone to Wingwalker Brewing!</div></div>","Short Summary

<p>Our elevator pitch? Ready?! We are a local foods grocery store, kinda like a 7-day-a-week farmer's market coming to downtown Clarkston, Fall 2017! We are a L3C all about supporting and promoting local farmers and local foods. Plus, awesome (locally) roasted coffee ☕</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are currently raising funds for a down payment for initial equipment costs such as refrigerators, freezers, display cases and produce shelving ($20,000) as well as a down payment to purchase a building space in downtown Clarkston ($30,000).  All funding will be utilized to purchase the space and initial equipment costs so we can start supporting our local farmers and making local foods more accessible to the residents of Clarkston and the metro Detroit area.</p>
<p>Many local farmers have expressed interest in selling products through The Farmer's Harvest for many reasons including:</p>
<p>1. It allows farmers to commit less time to selling their products and more time spent on their farms.</p>
<p>2. Starting farmers and producers don't have commit to the finances, time and equipment associated with selling their own products at a farm stand.</p>
<p>3. More sales and less food waste. Need we say more? With longer hours (7a-7p) and open 7 days/week customers have more accessibility to fresh foods and farmers have more opportunities to sell their produce, generating more sales and less food waste for farmers.</p>
<p>4. Any food waste that would make it past the point of sale, would be donated to food pantries in the area, or if unfit for consumption would be composted.</p>
<p>5. We have a pending partnership with The Student Organic Farm at Oakland University to sell their farm's produce as well as provide any compostable materials back to them to help fertilize their gardens. As part of the exchange of selling the fresh produce grown at the student organic farm, The Farmer's Harvest also offers a unique opportunity for biology and business students to shadow and intern.</p>
<p>6. Our small business supports the growth of local farmers and the local economy in Clarkston and the metro Detroit area.</p>
<p>7. The consignment model allows for producers to name there own price (70% of the ticketed price) while we add 30% for expenses. This ensures producers receive a fair asking price that they determine.</p>
<p>The local food consignment grocery model is based off of Argus Farm Stop, L3C in Ann Arbor. Argus opened almost 3 years ago and brought the consignment local foods model to Michigan. They have been unbelievably supportive and have helped us plan many aspects of The Farmer's Harvest. </p>
<p>The Owner, Angela Schultz, RDN graduated from Central Michigan University majoring in Dietetics, General Biology with an emphasis in Botany and a minor in Entrepreneurship. After graduating with a Bachelors of Science, she attended the dietetic internship at The University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers to being a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN).</p>
<p>Angela has worked in several environments including food service management, clinical dietetics and private practice nutrition consulting. While all of these paths were rewarding in different ways, nothing has as resonated with her the way in the way that her personal passion for gardening and fresh foods have. On opening, Angela would work as the Store Manager, alongside with her supportive husband John works as a Firefighter/Paramedic at Clinton Township and shares her passion for fresh food and farming.</p>
<p>The Farmer's Harvest pulls together the community in a way that supports farmers and increases access to fresh, delicious, local food varieties. It encourages farms to grow, new ones to start and people to reconnect with food and their community.</p>

<p>Estamos decididos a combatir la violencia y la discriminación dirigida a la población LGBTI, particularmente hacia las personas trans. Múltiples estudios e investigaciones señalan las grandes dificultades que tiene esta población para ser aceptada, las poquísimas oportunidades que tiene para encontrar un trabajo del que se sientan orgullosos, para mejorar sus condiciones económicas y para ser parte activa de la sociedad. Petunia es nuestra contribución para que esta situación cambie.   </p>
<p><i>We are determined to stand up against the violence and discrimination directed to LGBTI population, particularly toward Trans people. Several studies and investigations point at the overwhelming obstacles that this segment of the population faces in order to be accepted, the scarce dignified job opportunities, and their difficult economic and social conditions. Petunia is our contribution and effort to change this state of things. </i></p>
<h3>¡NECESITAMOS TU AYUDA! / WE NEED YOUR HELP!</h3>
<p>Nuestro objetivo es recaudar $20.000 dólares para darle forma al proyecto y abrir nuestro primer taller de pastelería. Este será un espacio de inclusión, de diversidad y de encuentro donde cualquiera pueda pasar un rato ameno con una torta, un brownie y un buen café. Ofreceremos inicialmente trabajo y capacitación a tres personas trans, quienes trabajarán en la cocina y en atención al público. Si logramos recaudar $25.000 podremos adquirir nuestros propios hornos y ofrecer una experiencia más enriquecedora a nuestros clientes. </p>
<p><i>Our goal is to raise $20.000 so our project comes to fruition, opening our first bakery shop. This will be a space for inclusion and diversity, where one and all can spend a pleasant time with a piece of cake, a brownie and a good coffee. We will initially train and hire three trans employees, whom will work in the kitchen and in customer service. However, if we can raise $25.000 we will be able to have our own ovens and offer an even more gratifying experience to our customers.</i></p>

<p>En nuestro menú tenemos tortas, galletas, brownies, cupcakes y cheesecakes. Hemos participado con éxito en varios matrimonios donde la torta de Petunia ha competido con la novia por las miradas.

<p><i>We already have an established menu that includes cakes, cookies, brownies, cupcakes and cheesecakes. We have been part of marriage celebrations where the Petunia cake has almost out-shined the bride. Some companies that have shown interest in our project have already tasted our sweet products. We have some original items warming up in the oven! They will be revealed after our opening.</i></p>
<h3>¿Por qué es importante? / Why it matters</h3>
<p>Desde luego, por nuestro amor por la pastelería artesanal y la comida de calidad, por darle sabor a las tardes de lluvia y a las mañanas soleadas. Pero no solo por esto. Creemos con sinceridad que todos estamos en la capacidad (y en la obligación) de contribuir al mejoramiento de nuestro país, enfrentando la violencia,  la discriminación y el sufrimiento que muchos colombianos viven a diario. Este proyecto ayudará a fortalecer a la comunidad LGBTI y a promover el diálogo con otros grupos de nuestra sociedad. Proyectamos desarrollar nuestra idea a escala nacional y a asociarnos con otras empresas, grandes y pequeñas, con el fin de transformar preconceptos y ampliar el panorama de las estructuras sociales.</p>
<p><i>First of all, because we love artisanal baking and quality food; because all rainy afternoons and sunny Sunday mornings deserve a sweet bite. But this is not all. We sincerely believe that each one of us has the capacity (and obligation as well) to contribute to the betterment of our country, confronting the violence, the discrimination and the suffering that many Colombians suffer daily. This initiative will give strength to the LGBTI community and will promote dialogue with the other groups of our society. We aspire to develop this on a national scale and to partner with other companies, larger and smaller, looking to make a change in the way certain social structures are perceived. </i></p>
<h3>Metas e impacto / Goals and impact </h3>
<p>En el primer año nuestra meta es construir un equipo con al menos 3 trabajadores transgénero, a quienes ofreceremos un salario justo, entrenamiento y oportunidades para crecer más allá de Petunia. Luego de este periodo crucial y a través de alianzas e intercambio de experiencias, fomentaremos la implementación de políticas de trabajo incluyente para la población LGBTI, como parte de la responsabilidad social corporativa, de la igualdad de oportunidades y de la equidad de género. Los primeros 6 meses de trabajo estarán también enfocados en alcanzar la meta de rentabilidad. Tras 12 meses aspiramos que nuestros primeros empleados tengan excelentes ofertas laborales en compañías de primer nivel; así podremos renovar nuestra plantilla y continuar ofreciendo plazas de trabajo, entrenamiento, experiencia y sustento a nuevas personas. También habremos terminado de equipar nuestra propia cocina profesional y prepararemos el lanzamiento de otro punto de venta.</p>
<p><i>During our first year we aim at building up a team with at least 3 transgender employees, which will receive a fair wage, skill training and further employment possibilities beyond Petunia. After this crucial period and through strategic alliances and experience sharing with like-minded businesses, we will champion the implementation of inclusive work policies for the LGTBI population, as part of corporate social responsibility and gender equality. </i></p>
<p><i>The first six months of work will be also focused on reaching profitability. After the first year, we hope to see top job offers flowing in for our first employees, paving the path for new Petunia staff. By that time our kitchen will be fully equipped, and our team will be ready to launch a second brick and mortar location.</i></p>

<h3><strong>Help us open HeartBeet Organic Superfoods Cafe in West Seattle</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Monika Kinsman and I'm the founder of <a href=""http://www.heartbeethealthy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HeartBeet Organic Superfoods Cafe</a> located in the Roosevelt neighborhood of Seattle.  We've been open since 2008, and have served hundreds of thousands of customers our delicious smoothies, fresh juices, delectable grain bowls, salads, and specialty pies. We use only the freshest organic, gluten-free and dairy-free ingredients and we don't use ovens or microwaves because our food is ALIVE!  Customers always tell us how they leave our cafe feeling healthier and more vibrant. </p>
<p>Our mission is to get America hooked on superfoods and it's been my dream to open more locations.  The opportunity has come to open a second location in the awesome community of West Seattle!  We have secured a lease at one of the new developments on Fauntleroy, but we need your help raising money for finishing the buildout, kitchen equipment, and working capital.</p>
<h3>Why open in West Seattle?</h3>
<p>We love West Seattle!   My wife and I are raising our family here, who attend Louisa Boren STEM K-8.  We could not be happier with the supportive community and beautiful ammenties of West Seattle.  With Alki Beach, yummy restaurants, quirky bars, gorgeous parks, amazing views of Puget Sound, and the community of families and friends... what's not to love about West Seattle?</p>
<p>We have a unique opportunity with a VERY supportive local landlord (a good neighbor) who really wants us to occupy this location which will be next to a yoga/barre studio and a wellness clinic.  Having HeartBeet Cafe there just <i>makes sense!</i>  There are not many quick serve healthy options in West Seattle, so we strongly believe this location will do well.  We tried to obtain funding through the Small Business Administration (SBA) and several banks, without success.   Most banks don't typically lend money for startup restaurants, and we don't have enough cash on hand to take advantage of this opportunity on our own.  We have about 20 days left to raise the money to make this location work.  If we don't raise the money soon, unfortunately, this location won't happen.</p>
<h3>How YOU Can Help!</h3>
<p>Whether you've been a long time fan of HeartBeet Cafe or you're a West Seattle resident who wants to see something like this in your community, YOU can help!  We need to raise $180,000 to help us purchase kitchen equipment, help finish the build out portion of the cafe, and working capital to open in January of 2018.  Whether it's $10, $1,000, or anywhere in between, we could use your help in raising the money needed to reach our goal and spreading the word about our mission.</p>
<h3><strong>All the Value is Returned to you!</strong></h3>
<p>Although Indiegogo is framed as a donation-style campaign, you actually get the full value (and in some cases, a greater value) than what you put in.  You pre-purchasing a $100 gift card now, for example, helps us gather the cash we need to open, and at the same time, you get to spend that $100 in return at a later date.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This campaign has an audacious, lofty goal.  There is a big risk that we won't secure all of the funding that we need, and if we aren't close to our goal, we won't be able to open.  However, if you're considering contributing to this campaign, don't wait!  We want to see early success in the campaign and know that progress will encourage others to follow-suit and contribute.  And like it said in the previous paragraph, all the money you put in comes back to you in rewards that you can use at our Roosevelt location, so you really won't be out if we don't make it.</p>
<p>If we do not meet our goal, we will use the funding that we raised during this campaign to reduce our debt load and hopefully make ourselves more ""bankable"" in the future -- meaning, any amount of debt reduction that we can do, will help our case with banks and credit unions moving forward, so we can go back to them down the road and reapply for funding at a later time.</p>
</div><div><div>
<h3>Thank You</h3>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about our campaign and hope you will share this with your family and friends.  Thank you to the loyal HeartBeet Cafe customers who have helped our Roosevelt location <i>thrive</i>.   And thank you to the community of West Seattle for supporting our family and our vision and for just being super awesome!  Please help to share our campaign far and wide.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for making our dream a reality by giving West Seattle <strong><i>Real Food That Loves You Back! </i></strong></p>
</div></div></div>","Help us open HeartBeet Organic Superfoods Cafe in West Seattle
My name is Monika Kinsman and I'm the founder of HeartBeet Organic Superfoods Cafe located in the Roosevelt neighborhood of Seattle.  We've been open since 2008, and have served hundreds of thousands of customers our delicious smoothies, fresh juices, delectable grain bowls, salads, and specialty pies. We use only the freshest organic, gluten-free and dairy-free ingredients and we don't use ovens or microwaves because our food is ALIVE!  Customers always tell us how they leave our cafe feeling healthier and more vibrant. 
Our mission is to get America hooked on superfoods and it's been my dream to open more locations.  The opportunity has come to open a second location in the awesome community of West Seattle!  We have secured a lease at one of the new developments on Fauntleroy, but we need your help raising money for finishing the buildout, kitchen equipment, and working capital.
Why open in West Seattle?
We love West Seattle!   My wife and I are raising our family here, who attend Louisa Boren STEM K-8.  We could not be happier with the supportive community and beautiful ammenties of West Seattle.  With Alki Beach, yummy restaurants, quirky bars, gorgeous parks, amazing views of Puget Sound, and the community of families and friends... what's not to love about West Seattle?
We have a unique opportunity with a VERY supportive local landlord (a good neighbor) who really wants us to occupy this location which will be next to a yoga/barre studio and a wellness clinic.  Having HeartBeet Cafe there just makes sense!  There are not many quick serve healthy options in West Seattle, so we strongly believe this location will do well.  We tried to obtain funding through the Small Business Administration (SBA) and several banks, without success.   Most banks don't typically lend money for startup restaurants, and we don't have enough cash on hand to take advantage of this opportunity on our own.  We have about 20 days left to raise the money to make this location work.  If we don't raise the money soon, unfortunately, this location won't happen.
How YOU Can Help!
Whether you've been a long time fan of HeartBeet Cafe or you're a West Seattle resident who wants to see something like this in your community, YOU can help!  We need to raise $180,000 to help us purchase kitchen equipment, help finish the build out portion of the cafe, and working capital to open in January of 2018.  Whether it's $10, $1,000, or anywhere in between, we could use your help in raising the money needed to reach our goal and spreading the word about our mission.
All the Value is Returned to you!
Although Indiegogo is framed as a donation-style campaign, you actually get the full value (and in some cases, a greater value) than what you put in.  You pre-purchasing a $100 gift card now, for example, helps us gather the cash we need to open, and at the same time, you get to spend that $100 in return at a later date.
 

Risks & Challenges
This campaign has an audacious, lofty goal.  There is a big risk that we won't secure all of the funding that we need, and if we aren't close to our goal, we won't be able to open.  However, if you're considering contributing to this campaign, don't wait!  We want to see early success in the campaign and know that progress will encourage others to follow-suit and contribute.  And like it said in the previous paragraph, all the money you put in comes back to you in rewards that you can use at our Roosevelt location, so you really won't be out if we don't make it.
If we do not meet our goal, we will use the funding that we raised during this campaign to reduce our debt load and hopefully make ourselves more ""bankable"" in the future -- meaning, any amount of debt reduction that we can do, will help our case with banks and credit unions moving forward, so we can go back to them down the road and reapply for funding at a later time.

Thank You
Thank you for taking the time to learn more about our campaign and hope you will share this with your family and friends.  Thank you to the loyal HeartBeet Cafe customers who have helped our Roosevelt location thrive.   And thank you to the community of West Seattle for supporting our family and our vision and for just being super awesome!  Please help to share our campaign far and wide.

<h3>Serving our Community</h3>
<p><strong>Over twenty five years ago, we began “making ripples” in our community. </strong>We began as a small martial arts school, and over time grew both in members and impact. We supported charities and community events, developed enrichment programs for the local schools, raised over $25,000 for local and national charities, and donated our time and materials to thousands of classrooms.</p>
<p><strong>As time went by, we realized that we could make so much more of an impact</strong> if we were no longer limited to teaching only martial arts. Through the years, we had been researching and developing a learning system that would allow any teacher to teach ANYTHING. We tested it through the martial arts, then applied to to everything from breakdancing, to painting, to science experiments. And it worked! And so, Questers’ Way was born.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527007580/iyog7abm18l0ebykvw8g.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We opened our beautiful, 16,000 square foot facility just over two years ago. Since that time, guests of all ages have learned new skills like ballet and creative writing. They’ve made new friends through our Game On! programs. We have on-site game masters facilitating everything from Dungeons and Dragons expeditions to table top game design classes. We teach music lessons, martial arts (of course), and so much more.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527007720/clmzomwrwgnxg6o94goh.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We've taught the value of healthy eating through our cafe. We offer everything from macro-nutrient balanced meals to delicious fruit smoothies. Both kids and adults had felt the impact of choosing to eat simple, tasty, real food.</p>
<p>We’ve hosted over 400 no-mess no-stress birthday parties for friends and families. We've had thousands of kids play in our indoor park. New friendships have been made, and long time friends have found a safe gathering place for their children while they relax and catch up over a cup of coffee.</p>

<p><strong>This place is awesome, and we are working on securing partnerships to help us begin building more centers throughout the country. </strong>We have many developers - especially for mall properties - who are very excited to see our concept brought to their communities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Challenges</h3>
<p>Our center is located in an area of Connecticut known as the “the last green valley”. Over 77% of this 700,000 acre area is forest and farmland. We decided it was important to open our first center in our hometown, however the lack of population and low economics of this area located in a struggling state have made it difficult to make the bend financially.</p>
<p>Many delays in the building of the center along with several unexpected obstacles along the way have left us needing to raise additional operating capital as we enter the slower summer season. <strong>We have had so much support and enthusiasm from so many people, and we just need a little boost to get us over this last hump. </strong>People are driving from over an hour away to visit our center…it is truly a special place!</p>
<p>Our goal is to serve the community and this center is very close to being financially sustainable. The purpose of our campaign is to help us raise some “over the hump” funds by showcasing some of the things that make our center so unique. We are so incredibly thankful for all of the wonderful experiences we’ve shared with so many over these first two years.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p><strong>200 local kids experiencing an awesome summer of fun and learning.</strong> That’s our goal with this campaign. There are so many families in our community who could benefit from what we do and are unable to afford it. For every $300 we raise, a child will receive over 30 hours of amazing classes, projects, friends and fun. We’ll even be able to provide healthy snacks and meals for them.</p>
<p>We set our goal high because we know how many kids could benefit from our center’s awesomeness. However, whatever we raise will immediately turn into programs for as many kids as possible.</p>

<h3>The Impact: A Love of Learning</h3>
<p><strong>There is nothing that can change a life for the better like a love of learning.</strong> What becomes possible when a child falls in love with their ability to learn new things? What becomes possible when they believe that they can grow as a person through their own efforts and interests? That’s what Questers’ Way is all about.</p>
<p>We’re here, and we’re ready to make a difference. This is only the first of many centers to come. We are actively working with developers to begin building more center as soon as the end of this year. Your contribution will not only help our local families, it will serve to demonstrate the support we have from people like you to see us bring Questers’ Way to the world.</p>
<p><strong>We already have so many stories.</strong> From the two moms who talked for hours screen-free while their kids played in the park, to the thousands of students who have been bused to the center for the enrichment programs that we provide free of charge, we’ve already made quite an impact. Check out our Facebook page and scroll through the timeline. We dare you to find a face that isn’t smiling!</p>

<p><b><u>How it works</u></b></p>
<p><b>Shoppers pull coupons as they enter
the mall and are also counted as impressions for the advertiser whose video ad
is playing on the screen as they are present in the viewing cone of the screen.
 Their presence in the mall defines them as being in a buying frame of
mind and makes them more likely to act on a store’s offer.</b></p>
<p><b><u>The big advantage to advertisers.</u></b></p>
<p><b>We deliver coupons and video
impressions to shoppers when they are only a couple hundred feet from the door
of the retailers whose ad they’ve seen and are almost certainly in a shopping
frame of mind.  These are big advantages
for mall advertisers.</b></p>
<p><b>I have put into this project around $80,000 and 3,000 hours over 2 ½ years, to get us to
the point where we have a working prototype ready to install and plan to open
our first location around February 1, 2015.</b></p>
<p><b><u>Why am I here?</u></b></p>
<p><b>We are here raising funds because
it’s our belief that once Retail Marketing Managers see how the COUPON-A-TRON
units can increase sales, they are going to demand them in all of the malls
that their stores are located. We will need funds in reserve to purchase
additional units to meet the demand. </b></p>
<p><b>I have to confess that when I first
heard of cause-based crowd funding, I was skeptical at best as to what it was
that we could come up with that would be a meaningful enough of a reward to motivate
people to join us.  It took a while, but
my team and I have come up with a plan that we think will motivate you to
donate.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><u>THE MALL MEDIA CHARITY INITIATIVE</u></b><br/></p>
<p><b>No matter if you donate $1.00 or $10,000 - we will distribute coupons for you for your friends and neighbors to donate to charitable organizations.</b></p><p><b>For the highest denomination

<p></p>
<p><span><b><u><span>How can we do this?</span></u></b></span></p>
<p><b>It is the nature of our business model
to have excess, unsold coupon or video ad slots every month.</b></p>
<p><b>Our business model is based on 25%
of our coupon capacity being sold and only 60% of our total video capacity
being sold, leaving large excesses of unused coupons that are wasted like empty
hotel rooms or airline seats when they’re not sold.  We concluded that the best thing for us to do
with them was to give them to charity to help raise funds.</b></p>

My name is Don Haese and I’m the
founder and president of Mall Media, Inc. and the inventor and developer of the
Coupon-A-Tron system for increasing the store traffic and sales of major mall
retailers.
The Company’s self-service,
automated Coupon-A-Tron kiosk systems will be located inside the main entrances
to major malls, the choke points where shopper foot traffic is most concentrated. 
They will continuously deliver fresh, rotating coupons, special offers and
video ad messages to the shoppers in the mall only from the merchants in
that mall.
How it works
Shoppers pull coupons as they enter

<p>The Problem</p>
<p>The recession has a negative impact on existing drug-related problems, worsening physical health, increasing self-destructive behavior and heightening the marginalization of drug users and their risk of relapse. They need to be offered vocational training in order to help their rehabilitation process, liaise with other vulnerable groups to enhance social awareness and create jobs for themselves, through economically viable social enterprises. </p>
<p><br/>The Solution</p>
<p>KETHEA STROFI webradio offers an excellent chance for social integration and vocational training for almost 30 ex drug addicts per year. The webradio hosts shows with famous radio producers, musicians and artists, writers, broadcasts live from prison settings, joins forces and gives voice to many socially vulnerable groups throughout Greece. It is a unique communication, creativity and rehabilitation platform, hosted in a therapeutic program for drug addicts. Along with its therapeutic and educational mission, it can mobilize support for marginalised groups, evolve into an employment solution for ex drug addicts and enhance KETHEA's fundraising efforts as a ""socially responsible sound studio"" (for CD recordings, music band rehearsals). </p>
<p><br/>Impact</p>
<p>KETHEA STROFI webradio started broadcasting on December 20th 2010. During these years, almost 150 people joined the webradio team, and on a week basis attend radio lessons for 6 hours (on sound, voice characteristics, recording, radio programming) and produce a weekly webradio program. Almost 1/3 of the group members pass the know how to their peers and help as volunteers in the management of the radio station. During 2013, 50 well known musicians, singers, actors and artists were invited to the radio show EPI TOPOU STROFI which is created by KETHEA STROFI webradio team and hosted weekly by ERA (the Greek public radio station). This resulted in 30 one-hour radio shows that disseminated prevention messages about drug addiction, through well known ""embassadors"", and provided the perfect proof that ex drug addicts can fully and actively reintegrate in society. ll Impact Potential</p>
<p>In order for the webradio to be the main communication channel among valnurable social groups and a best practice example of vocational training, it should ""travel"" throughout Greece, in remote villages and islands, in prison settings, even in hospitals. The creation of a ""mobile radio studio"" could serve this goal. </p>
<p>Another fundamental strategy for the future, is the self funding of the project. The creation of a hitech sound studio, run by ex drug addicts experts in recording techniques, and given to music bands under a symbolic price, will safeguard the sustainability of the project. </p>
<p>The webradio and sound studio could be used for the following:<br/> • creation of audio advertising (spot) for television and radio and recording (narration, dubbing , radio productions, speakage) for payment.<br/> • recording demos complexes and rent the space for group rehearsals</p>
<p>• recording and production of music albums. </p>
<p>• creating a mobile studio in order to record outdoors. The portable studio could be also used as an entertaining and educational space in prison settings, where KETHEA STROFI offers services to inmate drug addicts</p>
<p><br/>What We Need </p>
<p>The funding accomplished will cover everyday and operational costs of the radio station. Furthermore, new equipment is needs to be bought in for the sound studio to be functional and attract musicians to record there. </p>

<p>We have decided to do this campaign to help us with adding new drains &amp; concrete to our brewery. We will also use funds to increase our wood cellar capacity. This will help us produce more wild &amp; sour beer. We will release these beers as part of our Loess Hills Farmhouse Series. They will be packaged in both kegs &amp; specialty released 750ml bottles. The more we increase our cellar capacity, the more beer we can get into your hands!</p>
<p>Any amount raised past our goal will be used to purchase more oak barrels &amp; stainless steel kegs.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>Marto Brewing Company will be an innovative artisan brewery. We will produce craft beer with the highest quality ingredients from all over the world. With these ingredients we will incorporate local ingredients, such as raw honey, fruit, and grains. We are also very excited to implement the use of whiskey and wine barrels to condition some specialty beers. We will combine these ingredients with traditional and unconventional brewing methods to produce world class beer. We have a projected opening during the second half of 2015. We are just as excited to hire willing and hard working local employees as we are implementing local ingredients into our product. Having employees who know our customers and area will be a benefit to our business.<br/><br/><b>About Marto</b><br/>Marto Brewing Company was formed when a hobby turned into a pursuit to perfect the craft. With over 5 years of brewing experience, Owner and Brewer, Erik Martin has a proven track record of producing high quality beers. After a few years of brewing Erik began to enter brewing competitions and many awards were earned. Some of the most recent awards are Best of show at the 2014 Nebraska State Fair, Best of Show at the 2014 Omaha River City Roundup, and many 1st places in categories such as Imperial Stout and IPA. Erik also won the 2014 Omaha Beer Week Homebrew Showcase, which is organized by the Nebraska Brewing Company. That beer was re-brewed with Nebraska Brewing Company at their brewpub and served at a ticketed beer and food pairing event.<br/>
</div>
<div><b>Brewery &amp; Taproom</b></div>
<div>Our brewery and taproom will be located on Historic 4th Street in downtown Sioux City, Iowa. The beer will be brewed on a 7 barrel brewing system. The tap room will have ten taps to serve our customers from. The taproom will be a warming environment with the bar and decor built from old barn poles and wood. The barn wood was sourced from family farms, located right here in the Onawa area and the Loess Hills.<br/><br/><b>Our Beer</b><br/>We will produce a core, seasonal, and a premium lineup of beers. Our core lineup will consist of traditional styles such as an American Pale Ale, IPA, Robust Porter, &amp; Imperial Stout. Our seasonal styles will very from season to season and will incorporate seasonal fruits, grains, and hops to name a few. Our premium lineup is known as the Loess Hills Farmhouse Series.<br/><br/>The Loess Hills Farmhouse Series will be brewed with traditional, rustic old world, and innovative processes depending on the end result the brewer is intending. These beers will be fermented and conditioned in both stainless steel and wood. In this series we will ferment the beer with many different yeasts and bacteria at different stages of the fermentation. Something that will make our beer unique to any other beer out there, is the use of local yeast &amp; bacteria. We will capture these cultures in the Loess Hills. We have already isolated a ""wild"" strain of brettanomyces yeast that has the characteristics that we are looking for. In our trial batches, this strain paired excellent with our other saison yeast strains. This series will be excellent to enjoy on the day we release them or they can be aged for years like a fine wine.</div>

<br/><p><br/></p>
<b>Sales &amp; Distrobution</b><br/>Along with purchasing our beer by the glass at the tap room, beer lovers will be able to take a ""growler"" home with them. Growlers typically come in 32oz &amp; 64oz packages and are refillable at the tap room. We will also self distribute kegs of beer to select accounts in Siouxland, Des Moines,&amp; Iowa City at the beginning phase of the business. We will also bottle the Loess Hills Farmhouse Series beers in 750 milliliter champagne style bottles. These bottles will be self distributed to Siouxland, Des Moines, Council Bluffs, Iowa City, and more locations throughout the Midwest. As our production capacity increases we will begin to move to new markets around the country.<br/>
</div>
<div>We have already started the ground work of partnering with retail, bars, restaurants, &amp; distributors. New relationships have opened up after we shared our beer with these establishments. Excited beer enthusiasts have also contacted some of these establishments urging them to sell our beer when production begins. </div>

The tap room will have ten taps to serve our customers from. The taproom will be a warming environment with the bar and decor built from old barn poles and wood. The barn wood was sourced from family farms, located right here in the Onawa area and the Loess Hills.Our BeerWe will produce a core, seasonal, and a premium lineup of beers. Our core lineup will consist of traditional styles such as an American Pale Ale, IPA, Robust Porter, & Imperial Stout. Our seasonal styles will very from season to season and will incorporate seasonal fruits, grains, and hops to name a few. Our premium lineup is known as the Loess Hills Farmhouse Series.The Loess Hills Farmhouse Series will be brewed with traditional, rustic old world, and innovative processes depending on the end result the brewer is intending. These beers will be fermented and conditioned in both stainless steel and wood. In this series we will ferment the beer with many different yeasts and bacteria at different stages of the fermentation. Something that will make our beer unique to any other beer out there, is the use of local yeast & bacteria. We will capture these cultures in the Loess Hills. We have already isolated a ""wild"" strain of brettanomyces yeast that has the characteristics that we are looking for. In our trial batches, this strain paired excellent with our other saison yeast strains. This series will be excellent to enjoy on the day we release them or they can be aged for years like a fine wine.



Sales & DistrobutionAlong with purchasing our beer by the glass at the tap room, beer lovers will be able to take a ""growler"" home with them. Growlers typically come in 32oz & 64oz packages and are refillable at the tap room. We will also self distribute kegs of beer to select accounts in Siouxland, Des Moines,& Iowa City at the beginning phase of the business. We will also bottle the Loess Hills Farmhouse Series beers in 750 milliliter champagne style bottles. These bottles will be self distributed to Siouxland, Des Moines, Council Bluffs, Iowa City, and more locations throughout the Midwest. As our production capacity increases we will begin to move to new markets around the country.

We have already started the ground work of partnering with retail, bars, restaurants, & distributors. New relationships have opened up after we shared our beer with these establishments. Excited beer enthusiasts have also contacted some of these establishments urging them to sell our beer when production begins. 



   What We Need & What You Get  We need to raise $10,000 to help us with some of our startup costs. Details are listed at the top.  The merchandise perks will arrive within 2 months of the campaign end date. The beer, tasting, brewing, etc will be honored once we have our license and production has started.     
The Impact
Not only do we want to produce great craft beer, we want to revitalize our town and area businesses. Craft beer lovers will travel to our brewery. This will have an impact on many businesses such as gas stations, hotels, & restaurants to name a few. 
We will use many agriculture ingredients so the growers, wholesalers, & distributors near and far will benefit. Many less noticeable jobs will benefit such as retail employees, yeast & product analysis laboratories, glass manufactures & steel producers.

<p><b>Jack Rockwell Coffee </b>– Is unveiling
its unique one of a kind single cup brewing innovations. The age of bean to cup
coffee is finally here.
The retail coffee experience is about to witness a seismic
shift in commercial coffee brewing from the traditional filtered,
drip pot brewer, pod system or pour over. Our team has been focused
and committed on radically redefining the coffee experience and our pressure
brewing coffee machine known as the FarQuest® delivers that.<span>  We are poised to
redefine how the world drinks enjoys coffee.  A
perfect cup of fresh brewed coffee at the touch of a single button in under 30 seconds.</span></p>
Jack Rockwell has groundbreaking technology that offers a new <b>patented</b> method of brewing and enjoying
gourmet coffee.<span>  We begin with whole beans
which are ground in seconds and then pressured brewed, bean to cup in 30
seconds, thanks to our patented<b> FarQuest</b></span><b>®</b> brewing chamber. The FarQuest® has proven innovative technology can be pure and natural and taste
delicious.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1343162/files/20150331132453-chamber.jpg?1427833493"" src="""" style=""width: 406.642px; height: 553px;""/></p>
<br/><p>We have worked ardeusly over the years and have been awarded 2 patents so far.  We specialize in making of a newly patented commercial grade, single cup coffee brewing
system known as “The Farquest”.  The
Farquest produces a French press style cup of coffee from whole bean to cup in
thirty seconds. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>                                                     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1366657/files/20150408144829-4ad38b5dc3218f96008c39f9bad765d3.jpg?1428529709"" src="""" style=""width: 194.549px; height: 243px;""/></p>
<br/><p>Using our patented process along with a patented brew chamber,
the Farquest is unique, innovative and makes quality gourmet coffee all at the
touch of a single button.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1343223/files/20150331134723-JR-Farquest01.jpg?1427834843"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The only one of its kind. Our patented process is pressure
brewing.  The Farquest produces a fresh superior cup of coffee which
is very similar to a French Press style of brewing as opposed to the industries
old, drip pot method. The Farquest is environmentally friendly, since we don’t
use filters or pods, our machine doesn’t pollute our ecosystem. </p>
<p>The Farquest unique system will become the standard in
coffee brewing.  The days of drip-pot,
pod systems and large stale vats of coffee will be a thing of the past.  No pods or K-cups or paper filter is ever
needed since we use a steel micro filter that doesn’t require replacing.  Every commercial coffee establishment will want
our system of brewing since it allows for a fresh cup of delicious coffee every
time you press the button.  No more
pouring out large amounts of coffee because it has sat around for more than 20
minutes losing time and money! With The Farquest there is no waste at all since
every cup is made individually and bean to cup fresh, at a touch of a button,
in under a minute! You cannot get any fresher than that, short of going to get
coffee at the coffee farm.  It tastes great! And we are
currently developing a FarQuest for the home. 
Your help in this campaign will help us take us there.</p>

Currently we are using shared kitchen facility and cannot operate mini cart for hot food. We just sold it to invest in the food trailer with this project. We are not expecting an easier path and we know entrepreneurship is hard. We believe in our business, brand and our products. We walk with great passion and love for what we do.Not having our own kitchen facility is limiting our production and we will work hard to find a leasing commercial kitchen. Customers love our food and with your help we can operate food trailer this summer and work towards our own kitchen. We will guarantee high quality on our products using more local produce. We are hoping to distribute our products - True Cinnamon, Curry Blends and Pickles throughout Canada in near future.

<p><b>Un momento, ¿qué es eso de premium, conexiones y campañas? ¿Early User?, ¿eso no es un té?</b></p>
<p>En Gossty configuras tu cuenta para mostrar voluntariamente tus gustos y que así los establecimientos puedan ofrecerte productos a medida. Por ejemplo, te encanta la tortilla de bacalao, pues si haces una reserva para comer en un restaurante, podrán prepararte una tapita para ofrecértela mientras decides qué pedir. Tu la disfrutas y ellos te fidelizan, ¡todos ganan!</p>
<p>En algunos casos, un local puede planificar un evento y darle cierta exclusividad, por eso creamos la red Premium, para que dispongan de un circuito alternativo y así poder convocar a los usuarios con <b>cuenta Premium.</b></p>
<p>¿Y las conexiones y campañas?, Ahí está nuestro modelo de negocio. Cuando alguien busca un servicio, un establecimiento se lo ofrece y su oferta es seleccionada, se establece una <b>conexión</b>. Ese es el servicio que cobramos, poner en contacto la oferta y la demanda.</p>
<p>Pero podemos hacerlo al revés, Por ejemplo, un proveedor se ha equivocado y en vez de 2 kg de pollo te ha traído 20kg!!. Pues manos a la obra, mientras en la cocina preparan el rebozado, tu creas una <b>campaña </b>en<b> Gossty</b> para celebrar la <b>Noche del pollo frito</b>, nosotros seleccionamos a un grupo de usuario  que adoren ese plato y les mandamos un mensaje. Si no aceptan la invitación no te cobramos, y si lo hacen tampoco, que ya has pagado por la campaña (y menos de lo que crees).</p>
<p>Finalmente, <b>early user</b> es el usuario más exclusivo de todos, y que solo se podrá crear si ha participado en esta campaña de crowfunding. Tenemos muchos sorpresas esperando para vosotros...</p>
<p>Para aquellos que tengan curiosidad por nuestro modelo de negocio, estaremos encantados de recibiros en nuestras oficinas y explicaros cómo pensamos hacerlo, pero os dejamos a continuación un pequeño esquema de los segmentos de mercado a los que pretendemos llegar.<br/></p>

Summary</b></p>
<p>Greetings, I am Shishir Rao  resident in Dubai, one
of the most cosmopolitan city in the world. I have a degree in MIS from
Southern New Hampshire University and also studied
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Michigan
State.  </p>
<p> 
Our dream is to put forth an events company Icon Intelligence and Marketing that deals with business
conferences in diverse fields such as telecoms, finance, IT, broadcasting,
accounting as well as exhibitions, not to mention exhibition related services
such as stands, lighting, promoters.</p>
<p>Indeed we both have considerable
experience in the aforementioned.</p>
<p>It is not easy to compete with IQPC,
IIRs of the world and while we don't wish to brag, we believe we can offer a
superior product at lower cost through our unique talents.</p>
<p> 
 We were having difficulty raising the seed money for this enterprise
through  conventional methods. We had also already set up a beta site
which we was running since last fall . We have considerable interest from
various organizations both government and private for whom we executed some
modest projects in the past. However in order for this to come to fruition we
need to come with more capital than we currently have at our disposal which is
actually rather modest-relatively speaking.</p>
<p>With your generous support, you can
help us revolutionize how business information and networking can be overhauled
and help the small business owner ,free lancer as well as the large
behemoths(we are above all -fair) given a good deal for the monies they
dispense and not be subjected to the exorbitant amounts they are currently
been gouged right now by the majors. </p>
<p>How would we do that, well we
believe in relationships first and foremost and not the cowboy ant farm boiler
room take the money and run culture that unfortunately exists in this field. In
short, we believe in more pull than push.</p>
<p>While we are based in Dubai, we
envision our reach all across select cities in MENA, India,North America  and Europe within the next 10 years.</p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Most of what we hope you contribute
would go towards</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Renting
an office space over a two year lease</p></li>
<li><p>Trade
license fees and company bank account(min balance maintenance required from
bank)</p></li>
<li><p>Hiring
sales and admin staff for 1 year</p></li>
<li><p>Marketing

<li><p>Office
supplies such as laptops, printers, fax machines</p></li>
<li><p>Telephone
and internet monthly dues</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span> 
Paying subcontractors when we have a project in hand as we have to offer
the client 60 day credit facilities</span></p>
<p><span> 
We envision to bring over well known personalities in the business and
media world to our events. Our patrons if they are willing to avail,will receive
passes to the aforementioned events as well as access to upto date business
strategies and market know how in the concerned sector!</span></p>
<p>If we fail to reach our goal, we
will still go forward on a leaner, less ambitious mission statement. But we are
ever grateful for still bestowing what you could spare for even that
opportunity.</p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>As
the saying goes where the lion treads there is food for all. You will help us
become that kind of lion. Instead of<span> 
being the type of organization that sucks the life of the industry and
soul force and creativity out of its employees(this is an industry notorious
for high staff turnover) , you will be instrumental in helping us create less
frazzled and equitable company which still manages to deliver quality product</span></p>
<p>We
have been successful in producing(on a smaller scale) what we have proposed
above. We have ran exhibitions for Panasonic, UAE government. Conferences on
hedge funds,Retail Banking, construction, Telecom, Broadcasting and many more.</p>
<p>Of
these were our portfolios while working (semi independently) for other
companies</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We
don’t really envision a strong profit for the first year. After all as
mentioned we prefer to build relationships with our clients rather than the
take the money and run approach as practiced by some in the industry.</p>
<p>The
first year would be tight and difficult but that is part of the mission and we
cant stray from it.</p>
<p>But
we are in it for the long haul and we are confident when we deliver a
professional product in time with no hassle , we will have earned their trust
and loyalty and will stick around for the long haul </p>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p><b>We
appreciate any non monetary support as well. Please be sure to spread the word about
our company in any way you can. Not the least- use the indiegogo share tools to
get the job done.</b></p>

Telephone
and internet monthly dues

 
Paying subcontractors when we have a project in hand as we have to offer
the client 60 day credit facilities
 
We envision to bring over well known personalities in the business and
media world to our events. Our patrons if they are willing to avail,will receive
passes to the aforementioned events as well as access to upto date business
strategies and market know how in the concerned sector!
If we fail to reach our goal, we
will still go forward on a leaner, less ambitious mission statement. But we are
ever grateful for still bestowing what you could spare for even that
opportunity.
The
Impact
As
the saying goes where the lion treads there is food for all. You will help us
become that kind of lion. Instead of 
being the type of organization that sucks the life of the industry and
soul force and creativity out of its employees(this is an industry notorious
for high staff turnover) , you will be instrumental in helping us create less
frazzled and equitable company which still manages to deliver quality product
We
have been successful in producing(on a smaller scale) what we have proposed
above. We have ran exhibitions for Panasonic, UAE government. Conferences on
hedge funds,Retail Banking, construction, Telecom, Broadcasting and many more.
Of
these were our portfolios while working (semi independently) for other
companies


Risks
& Challenges
We
don’t really envision a strong profit for the first year. After all as
mentioned we prefer to build relationships with our clients rather than the
take the money and run approach as practiced by some in the industry.
The
first year would be tight and difficult but that is part of the mission and we
cant stray from it.
But
we are in it for the long haul and we are confident when we deliver a
professional product in time with no hassle , we will have earned their trust
and loyalty and will stick around for the long haul

<p>Uwe Rath, seit 25 Jahren in der Dominikanischen Republik, hat sein Unternehmen Uwescuba auf individuelles, technisches und Hoehlen - Tauchen ausgelegt. Um das Tauch -Angebot in der Zukunft attraktiver zu gestalten und um sich komplett von der Masse der anderen Tauchschulen abzuheben sollen sehr spezielle Tages und Mehrtages - Touren angeboten werden, die es so in Ihrer Art von keiner anderen Tauchschule in der Dom.Rep. gibt.  Hier ein paar Beispiele:</p>
<p><strong>Tagestour fuer Wrack - Liebhaber mit 4 Wracks in zwei Tauchgaengen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mehrtages - Touren fuer Hoehlentaucher rund um die Insel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tages und Mehrtages - Touren fuer unberuehrte Riff - Liebhaber</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tagestour und Mehrtages - Tour fuer Grossfisch - Liebhaber </strong></p>
<p>Das Bedarf natuerlich einer komplett anderen Logistik im Transport und bei der Ausruestung. Die Tauchgaeste muessen zu den entsprechenden Orten ueber Land transportiert und betreut werden. Je nach Tour muss die Ausruestung / Tanks komplett fuer mehrere Tage mitgenommen werden.</p>
<p>Um das auf die Beine zu stellen ist eine Investment - Summe von ca. USD 35.000 notwendig.</p>
<p>Die Investitionen werden sein:</p>
<p>Transporter mit Trailer fuer Personen und Ausruestung, transportabler Kompressor, spezielle Tankventile ( Rechts / Links ) fuer Sidemount - Konfiguration, Tanks, Tauchausruestung, Ausbau des Trailers als kleine fahrende Tauchschule. Genehmigungen und Versicherungen.</p>
<p>Wir moechten natuerlich nicht das Ihr Geld gebt und nicht davon habt. Wir werden je nach Einzahlungs - Summen entsprechende Gutscheine vergeben, die bei uns eingeloest werden koennen. Denn wenn wir so etwas machen, dann solltet Ihr, egal ob Taucher oder Nicht - Taucher einen Nutzen davon haben.</p>
<p>Da die meissten von Euch ja ueber die sozialen Netzwerke mit uns verbunden sind, werden wir Euch staendig ueber den Fortschritt der Kampagne informieren. Bei nicht erreichen der erforderlichen Summe werden wir versuchen mit dem eingegangenen Geld, das Projekt zumindest zu starten bis die Restsumme finanziert werden kann.</p>
<p>Wir sind sehr zuversichtlich das unsere Kampagne funktionieren wird, denn alle Gaeste die wir befragen, haben den Wunsch sich individueller in Ihrem Urlaub zu bewegen und Dinge zu erleben die nicht von einer breiten Masse angeboten werden.</p>
<p>Uwe Rath mit seiner 25 jaehrigen Erfahrung in der Dom.Rep. ist einer der wenigen der diese Touren mit Sinn und Verstand anbieten kann. Das laesst sich in den sozialen Netzwerken nachlesen. </p>

<ol><li><h3>About the Campaign</h3></li></ol>
<p>One of my fondest childhood memories is going to the bookstore with my parents and getting lost in the stacks. We lived in a rural area, so it was a rare treat when we went to the nearest town with a bookstore to visit (about an hour away from my home)- a bookstore that has since closed, to my sadness.  Those visits are part of what inspired my love of books, and my desire to someday manage a bookstore. </p>
<p>The online wing of the Red Hen Bookshop has been up and running on a small scale for four years now, and it is time for the next stage. The goal of this campaign is to fund the purchase of a mini camper to convert into a small Bookmobile, to enable the Red Hen to take books to the rural areas of the state that could not support a brick and mortar store full time.</p>
<p>Every bit helps to bring the bookstore experience to the rural areas of Missouri.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Ask (and the Perks)</h3>
<p>The cost of the mini camper is $4000. That is the asking amount for this campaign. If more is raised, wonderful- that will be put toward the cosmetic work, fixtures, and inventory for the bookmobile. </p>
<p>The Perks:</p>
<ol>
<li>All contributions get a shout out on the website.</li>
<li>$5 gets a Red Hen Stuffie</li>
<li>$15 gets a hand printed tote bag</li>
<li>$25 gets a hand printed scarf</li>
<li>$35 gets a Classic color scheme mug</li>
<li>$50 gets a mug and scarf or tote- dealer's choice</li>
<li>$75 gets a swag pack of everything</li>
<li>$100 gets books for six months</li>
<li>$150 gets books for a year</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>More books reaching more people, and in a way that enables them to support small business. Encouraging a love of reading is a key goal of the Red Hen Bookshop, and lifelong reading has so many benefits to the reader and their community. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Can Go Wrong?</h3>
<p>Worst case scenario is the campaign fails. No money, no bookmobile. The idea gets shelved for a few more years. What else? The $4000 is not met. In that event, whatever is raised goes into the bookmobile ""pot"" until enough money from sales can be added to it to cover the costs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Love the idea, wish you could support it, but the pandemic/life/everything is keeping you from being able to support in a monetary way? No worries! No guilt allowed- we've all been there at some point. Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Share the campaign using the handy sharing buttons- sharing is something anyone can do!</li>
<li>Tell your book loving friends about the campaign, and encourage others to contribute and/or share.</li>
<li>When you are able, if the campaign isn't here but you still want to support the Red Hen, visit the website, share the website, place an order or drop subtle hints that you want something from the Red Hen Bookshop for a gift- profits from the sale of Swag will be dropped in the Bookmobile ""pot"" alongside any contributions made.</li>

Worst case scenario is the campaign fails. No money, no bookmobile. The idea gets shelved for a few more years. What else? The $4000 is not met. In that event, whatever is raised goes into the bookmobile ""pot"" until enough money from sales can be added to it to cover the costs.

Other Ways You Can Help
Love the idea, wish you could support it, but the pandemic/life/everything is keeping you from being able to support in a monetary way? No worries! No guilt allowed- we've all been there at some point. Other things you can do:

Share the campaign using the handy sharing buttons- sharing is something anyone can do!
Tell your book loving friends about the campaign, and encourage others to contribute and/or share.
When you are able, if the campaign isn't here but you still want to support the Red Hen, visit the website, share the website, place an order or drop subtle hints that you want something from the Red Hen Bookshop for a gift- profits from the sale of Swag will be dropped in the Bookmobile ""pot"" alongside any contributions made.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Why We're Raising Funds</h3>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>COVID-19 is a global crisis that has turned many lives upside down. Several businesses like ours are trying to stay afloat. We started Matera just last year with the majority of our sales coming from events which we are no longer able to attend due to the current circumstances. When the shelter-in-place order was mandated in March, we worked on strengthening our online presence, but still faced a huge challenge as a new, small business. Despite this, we are grateful and believe we can get through this all together while helping others in need along the way as well.</p>
<p>We understand that other businesses such as ours and other individuals in communities are struggling due to COVID-19 and we'd like to help. This campaign is launched so that we can still share the benefits of yerba mate while supporting others. 10% of funds will go toward supporting local hospitals in California and vulnerable communities in Argentina. Please, help us, help others.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586907848/hedilgt4mqvvpadjppfv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Matera’s vision is to create social impact while fostering a global yerba mate community. The mission is to share the healthy and energizing benefits of Argentinian loose leaf yerba mate with more people. It was founded by us, Vir from Argentina, and Lina from the US. More than ever, we feel very connected to help vulnerable communities in the US and Argentina.<br/><br/>In California, Jiaren Cafe is one of our partners and a nonprofit neighborhood cafe in Santa Clara. We are supporting them by helping to provide free mate and drinks to local hospitals. Drinks are going to Kaiser Permanente (Santa Clara), Santa Clara Valley Center, O'Connor Hospital, El Camino Health, Palo Alto Medical Foundation (Palo Alto) and other health care locations. </p>

<p><br/>In Córdoba, Argentina, families in El Milagro neighborhood are facing difficult circumstances.

<h3>
<br/>Matera &amp; the Benefits of Yerba Mate</h3>
<p>Yerba mate is rich in antioxidants (more than green tea) that boosts energy and focus naturally and supports the immune system and high caffeine (like coffee) but without the jitters or crash.  One serving of Matera yerba mate is all you need for sustainable energy throughout the day and other health benefits.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586908042/ciukp8gjzcl8gybdiciv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Matera yerba mate is sourced from small-scale producers in Argentina so with your order you are supporting them and their artisan craftsmanship. Yerba mate leaves require an aging process — which can take anywhere from one month to three years. The longer it is aged, the better the quality and softer the taste. Matera yerba mate has been aged for over a year and has an earthy taste and no additives.</p>

<h3><strong>The Story of QuikFix:</strong></h3>
<p>The owners of <i>QuikFix Tech Repair</i>, Aaron Offenberger (myself) and Ken Gibb, have been friends for over 20 years and are now small business owners!</p>
<p>We have been in the electronics repair industry for a combined 12 years and have personally repaired over 20,000 devices (much of that being right here in Toledo)! We have built an incredible reputation in the Toledo area, being known at the <strong>Honest </strong>and <strong>Friendly</strong> tech repair guys (A reputation we are <strong>VERY</strong> proud of). </p>
<p>In June of this year, the company we were working for informed us they were going to move out of the state, leaving us both suddenly unemployed. We decided there is no time like the present, and decided to open our own repair shop. And thus, QuikFix Tech Repair was born! </p>
<p>We want to raise the bar on what to expect from a tech repair shop. Some of the ways we are going to do that are by:<br/>-Providing multiple brands of parts - resulting in prices that meet any budget<br/>-Providing unmatched PERSONABLE customer service - customers are more than numbers<br/>-Offering multiple repair services:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>In-Store</strong> - these repairs are done in house and take around an hour</li>
<li>
<strong>Mail-In</strong> - mail your device to us from anywhere for repair</li>
<li>
<strong>Mobile Repair Unit</strong> - we come to your home or office and repair your device<br/> </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Journey:</strong></h3>
<p>On July 1st, we signed the lease for what would become our storefront and started planning immediately, as we wanted to open as soon as possible and get back to work!</p>
<p>The following images are our mock-ups for the product displays and exterior:</p>

<p>The building was built in 1950 and was used as an automotive repair shop (notice the outlines of the old car ports on the right side of the exterior). It has been many things over the years, but was most recently a convenience store, which moved to a different location in 2014. The building has remained vacant, until now!</p>
<p>So, as you can see, we definitely had a lot of work ahead of us!</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, August 23rd. We opened our doors on August 5th and are making more and more progress toward our vision in the mock-ups! As I'm sure you know, a lot goes into opening a business...namely money! That's where you can help!</p>

</div></div>","Who We AreMy name is Earnest. For the past three years we have been working with an organization called Dreaming Out Loud learning to run a farmers market, called Aya Community Markets, since we were 11 years old. Now I'm 14 years old and we started growing our own healthy food as young urban farmers and creating our own jobs that are more fun than working at a fast food place. And we learn a lot more too. We need your help to expand our urban farm space so that we can support more youth like ourselves with jobs. Now that you've met Earnest, I am Chris Bradshaw, Founder and Executive Director of Dreaming Out Loud. We are building something special and need your help to create jobs through building an equitable food system! We need the infrastructure and people power to expand our community supported agriculture (CSA) program, grow more produce at our farm, and make healthy value-added products.
We started Aya Community Markets because in our work in after school programs for children and youth, we noticed unhealthy after-school snacks and no healthy food choices in the community. In 2014, we directly reached more than 10,000 people, distributed more than 100,000 pounds of produce, and had more than 1,500 people experience healthy cooking demonstrations at Aya Community Markets (Aya). 
We have farmers markets in two locations in our City: In Southwest DC (Ward 6) and Northeast DC (Ward 7) and each site is growing. We serve communities that do not have equal access to fresh, local produce by building relationships with community and farmers in the region. Through matching incentives, called ""Aya Bonus Bucks"", we help folks spending SNAP, WIC, EBT, and Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program benefits afford more healthy, fresh produce. 

   What We Need & What You Get This Indiegogo campaign will help us to continue serving our community at our two established farmers markets; invite and support new farmers; and expand our urban farm to support youth like Earnest. 
For our markets we need to get:


Meet our infrastructure requirements.

New tents and tables. 
Materials to continue community outreach (fliers, seasonality charts, and food for community meetings).
 
For our urban farm we need:

Grow-bags that allow us to expand garden space for growing healthy food with  youth farmer-entrepreneurs. 

Topsoil and compost. 
Insulated zip-up bags for our community supported agriculture program.
Construction materials for a greenhouse.
Electricity. 
One deep freezer.
Seeds and seedlings.
Crop planning from small farm designers.
Miscellaneous tools.

<strong>¿Por qué he elegido este proyecto?</strong>
</div>Este año he decidido realizar cinco esfuerzos/labores para sensibilizar sobre patrimonio abandonado, pintar este tren es mi tercera acción.<br/><br/>En <a href=""http://www.manuelcalavera.org/documentacion/008GEA/index.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""blank_"">la primera</a> recuperé 116 planos industriales, digitalizándolos, procedentes de una antigua fábrica de cerámica y loza abandonada. La fábrica está en su fase final de decadencia con las estructuras muy vandalizadas. Esto me llevó más de dos meses de trabajo.<br/><br/>Mi <a href=""http://www.mojonesdefortuna.es/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""blank_"">segunda acción</a> está encaminada a indexar hitos kilométricos del antiguo plan peña de 1940. Continúo trabajando en este proyecto, el cual me llevará unos cuantos meses más.<br/><br/>Para mi tercera acción decidí dar un pintado a este tren. Cuando lo ví me enamoré de él, pero en este caso mi mala situación económica me impide acometer el proyecto con mis propios medios. Por ello, he decidido realizar esta campaña de mecenazgo. Esperando vuestra comprensión y ayuda en dicha tarea.<br/><p></p>

I continue working in this project which will take me few more months. <br/><br/>For my third action I decided to paint this train. When I saw it, I fell in love, but in this case my poor economic situation inhibits me do this proyect with my own means. Therefore, I decided do this patronage campaign.

¿Por qué he elegido este proyecto?
Este año he decidido realizar cinco esfuerzos/labores para sensibilizar sobre patrimonio abandonado, pintar este tren es mi tercera acción.En la primera recuperé 116 planos industriales, digitalizándolos, procedentes de una antigua fábrica de cerámica y loza abandonada. La fábrica está en su fase final de decadencia con las estructuras muy vandalizadas. Esto me llevó más de dos meses de trabajo.Mi segunda acción está encaminada a indexar hitos kilométricos del antiguo plan peña de 1940. Continúo trabajando en este proyecto, el cual me llevará unos cuantos meses más.Para mi tercera acción decidí dar un pintado a este tren. Cuando lo ví me enamoré de él, pero en este caso mi mala situación económica me impide acometer el proyecto con mis propios medios. Por ello, he decidido realizar esta campaña de mecenazgo. Esperando vuestra comprensión y ayuda en dicha tarea.

aftermath of a soldier suicide. Our generation is facing a major struggle;
better yet, it can be defined as an epidemic. We are stricken by a plague of
self-destruction that is curable with love and support. The epidemic I am
referring to is Soldier Suicide. On average, we lose 22 soldiers and veterans a
day. That is 22 families left struggling with heartbreak. We understand the
struggle because most of us have been there to help families of friends cope
with such a sudden loss. We are asking for your help. Help to bring these
loving families of our lost brethren hope. #americansforheroes</p><h2>1. 
Project Background </h2>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">My name is Cris Hudson and I am a veteran. I am the
CEO/Founder of Americans for Heroes and I have stood side by side with some of
these heroes. I have shared a foxhole with them, met their families, and even
in some cases had to render honors at their funeral. It is never easy to see a
friend, brother, or sister in arms, or trusted soul fall in combat. It is never
easy to look at their spouse, or child, as they are told their loved one died
in combat. It is even worse to think they aren’t going home to their family, but
you are.</span><br/></p>
<p>These are thoughts all veterans have to endure. “If I could
go back, I would die right beside them,” is what goes through a veteran’s mind.
I was very lucky when I returned that I had such a loving, and understanding
family and group of friends in my life. They never let me feel alone, nor did
they ever shut me out when I needed to talk. They would sit down and give me
their undivided attention like this was the most important story of their
lives. Not every soldier has that. They come home to a cold, empty life. These
soldiers had to do things to survive that no one can fathom, and they are
dealing with this alone. In the end, some cannot take the thoughts and feel
that death is their only reprieve. When that happens, they leave behind loved
ones with unanswered questions. They have an overwhelming hole in their heart,
in their lives, and in their souls. </p>

We are a small, family run business ...meet the team... including George my husband...                                         myself Venetia ...                                             and Matilda our 16 year old daughter ...                                         who has grown up loving & caring for all of our animals.Over the past 15 years we have been caring and looking after farm animals. We take pride in having healthy & happy animals that have a good quality of life. Our farmyard is very well known in the local area and we are always happy to try and assist animals in need. We take our animals around to local schools, shopping malls, and birthday parties to engage and teach children and adults alike about animals and how to properly care for them.                
                      We live in an electronic generation and it's very common to hear about children spending hours upon hours shut in their room watching TV or playing computer games. We aim to get children outside and into the fresh air, even if it's just for an hour or so to learn compassion, responsibility and to gain hands on knowledge and experience of caring for animals.        
  Why do we need your help ? Its easy .... our mobile farmyard supports the day to day running of the business ie vet, feed, insurance, licensing, fencing bills.... but we need more space . People frequently call us asking us to care for an animal ... there can be many reasons ... ie mother won't feed the baby, mother passed away in the birthing process, baby has been found distressed and away from other animals, animal has become too large or was a mistake buy for someone ... the list goes on and on. 
Our original converted stables:
              


                   
The animals that we raise are well socialized and once they no longer depend on us for their milk and early care this helps us to find homes for them in pairs on hobby farms or return them to their original farm once they can just graze and have hard feed. However after 15 years we are bursting at the seams and in desperate need of a new barn in order to further care and nurture the many animals we look after. 
Recent arrivals.... 2 Of our newest rescues to turn up ...Below are just a couple of animals that have arrived recently ...                     Little piggy turned up on the 10th August 2015 ... look how little he is compared to his brothers & sisters ... and he's heading the wrong way. The farmer knew he would never latch on & he would get weaker as his brothers & sisters got stronger.                                       For the first week he was spoilt and got to sleep by the fire inside !!! He needed feeds little & often even through the night every 2 hours...too much formula and he could have got the runs.Just look at him now 18 days later ....
                           

Little ""Roscoe"" the South African Boer goat turned up last week. Luckily a friend of ours spotted him on a lost & found fb site. He had been found covered with ticks & lice in the bush at the back of someones house. They needed someone to care for him .... luckily a vet nurse picked him up ... treated him for the lice ... removed the ticks & nurtured him through the night. She dropped him to us in the morning and happily he is accepting his 4 feeds of goat formula a day & is mixing with the rest of our similar aged goats & lambs. Good result all round !
                                   


Our main goal for this project is to raise as near to $25000 as we possibly can. This will enable us to :Buy a barn .....                                     $7000Erect the barn .....                              $2000Concrete slab ....                                $6000Update our second hand float .... $7000                                                             ....................                                                                $22000Any extra funds will be used to sign-write float & fit out the barn !What can we give you in return for helping us..Our Perks ...To raise the funds we have come up with some wonderful perks !!!!

Ultimate Nadia - Meet our beautiful ""Nadia"" she has been every little girls favorite for 15 years ! (Don't worry she only goes pink for special occasions & its totally natural colour ).

Nadia is loved by young and old ...     
even though she is cheeky sometimes ....

                                                                                                                          Photo : Martin Ollman

Ultimate Lucille -""Lucy"" Llama came to us when she was just 3 weeks old ... she had a problem with her balance & couldn't feed so mum rejected her..... she has grown into a real star .... and she is just a must for selfies !!!!                                
She would even sneak inside looking for her bottle if you left the back door open when she was young ...
                                       
                                    Shes even been on TV ! ... with Colin Buchanan

  Even Piggy & Idol have met the  Better Homes Team !!

             
                                  "" Midweek visit from mini pets"" ... 
Here is another great perk we are offering - this is very exciting we have 2 large tubs that we place sawdust and a selection of bunnies,guineas,chicks and ducklings. Its just the right height for little ones to observe, pat and feed the animals PLUS they love to have their photo taken holding the little nest baskets !! Fully supervised and ideal for small groups.

                                         
     
             
               



Signage on our float & mobile pen .. this perk is aimed at local companies. We attract a lot of people wherever we go... our horse float is very eye catching ...

                              Hows that for a queue ... it happens every day for 17 days ... plenty of exposure there !!! We even have to have designated pram parking !!!                      

The next perk I am afraid is just for people who can get to the farm .... we are offering....  Behind the scenes visit ... A private visit for a family of 2 adults and up to 3 children to see the farm .... the mobile farm is out and about most weekends so visits tend to be midweek or during holidays.

<p>This is Blessing, a 3 year old girl ‘<i>disposed of due to the spiritual sickness that was believed to have caused her disability. For many others there is almost no access to equipment, education, transport, healthcare or work. As a result, many live in abject poverty. The stigma attached to disabled people and their families has shocking consequences, including confinement and torture. There are also unconfirmed reports that sacrifices of disabled children take place, conducted by so-called ‘fetish priests</i>’, written by presenter and campaigner Sophie Morgan.</p>

<p>The remaining funds from this project will go to the design process of this collection and a new super team in fashion, business, campaigning, public relations, and social media. In order to realistically reach our goal in sales, expanding and spreading awareness, we need a strong team to build those foundations – we want to create a brand with substance that will out last us.<br/></p>
<p>The
inspiration for this Autumn Winter Collection is Ghana. Inspired and touched by
Sophie’s documentary, Loulou wanted to help these children. After
researching the country further she discovered how beautiful its colours,
prints, and textures truly are. </p>
<p>‘<i>Ghana is full of tribal colours and culture, vibrant prints and textures that challenge me to create something out of the ordinary and appealing to our customers.

<p>This opportunity will help our growth tremendously. We aim to form a partnership with many department stores whom will sell our collections in order to reach a volume of people to spread awareness of our philanthropy through childrenswear.

</div></div>","After watching presenter and campaigner Sophie Morgan’s recent BBC documentary on disability in Ghana - Loulou Bontemps, owner and designer for la pitchoune decided to take a new direction in growing her up and coming luxury brand.Through this campaign we will build a concept that will expand our brand and allow us to donate 20% of our profits to independent charities around the world – philanthropy through children’s fashion.The £6,000 from this campaign will be donated to The Orthopaedic Centre www.otcghana.info run by Sister Elizabeth Newman and the Physically Challenged Action Foundation www.pcaf.com.gh run by Mr Barima. Funds will help Mr Barima & Sister Newman look after those they already support and open their doors to more children in need around Ghana.But this is only the beginning; we want to raise funds via the sales of our dresses to support children in as many places as we can reach.We aim to raise further funding to build the fashion campaign #createandgive and The Phoenix Rising Charitable Trust for us to begin reaching out to other children in danger and disabled at home and around the world.la pitchoune is a luxury childrenswear label selling dresses for girls. After their first year selling online they have developed an audience around the globe and received great press in Vogue Bambini, British Vogue, CWB, The Guardian and more. 


‘we are at the cusp of expanding to retailers in the United States and the UK, I want to seize this opportunity and give back to where my inspiration in fashion came from, my childhood.’ Loulou bontemps

Here is a touching example of the purpose behind our goals…
 

This is Blessing, a 3 year old girl ‘disposed of due to the spiritual sickness that was believed to have caused her disability. For many others there is almost no access to equipment, education, transport, healthcare or work. As a result, many live in abject poverty. The stigma attached to disabled people and their families has shocking consequences, including confinement and torture. There are also unconfirmed reports that sacrifices of disabled children take place, conducted by so-called ‘fetish priests’, written by presenter and campaigner Sophie Morgan.
With the profits made throughout the growth of our collection and brand, we would help many more just like Blessing at the OTC and support Mr Barima in building his centre to give disabled children, young adults and adults suffering from a form of disability a better chance at life.

The remaining funds from this project will go to the design process of this collection and a new super team in fashion, business, campaigning, public relations, and social media. In order to realistically reach our goal in sales, expanding and spreading awareness, we need a strong team to build those foundations – we want to create a brand with substance that will out last us.
The
inspiration for this Autumn Winter Collection is Ghana. Inspired and touched by
Sophie’s documentary, Loulou wanted to help these children. After
researching the country further she discovered how beautiful its colours,
prints, and textures truly are. 
‘Ghana is full of tribal colours and culture, vibrant prints and textures that challenge me to create something out of the ordinary and appealing to our customers. A collection that expresses our inspiration and respect for a beautiful culture, while supporting their children in need.’ Loulou Bontemps

When we reach our entire goal! the money raised will go to launching this new philanthropic direction and the development of the collection. This will include 8 of our bestselling styles, each with 3 choices of fabrics, providing buyers a collection of 24 items to choose from. We need to design this collection in order to appeal to our market and capture the interest of luxury buyers.
The funds we raise after the £6000 contributions will contribute to build and launch…
-  The design process creating a collection that appeals to the masses in luxury childrenswear; including sample fabrics and the making of the sample collection.
- Trade Shows in order to reach out to buyers that shop for our target audience (Bubble Trade Show, Pitti Bimbo & Playtime New York).
- Public relations to create understanding between the public, product, and idea.
- Social Media to inspire and inform our audience.
- Campaigning reaching as many people as we can, while managing the funds to be as productive as they can.
- Business consultancy to help build strong foundations for the growth of la pitchoune.
- Look books, displays, advertising and more.
- To open The Phoenix Rising Trust, in order to manage and direct the funds for those in need.
The money put in The Phoenix Rising Trust will be distributed to children in danger, disabled and generally left behind all around the world.
The success of building this project will allow us to create with no boundaries!
THE CHALLENGES
This opportunity will help our growth tremendously. We aim to form a partnership with many department stores whom will sell our collections in order to reach a volume of people to spread awareness of our philanthropy through childrenswear. The luxury market is a specialised field, we want to take special care in forming loyal relationships with our buyers. Our team aims to conquer this market.
la pitchoune is a Made in Britain label. 
We have manufacturers ready to take our orders. We create our own designs, using fabrics imported from around the world and then printed here in England.

</p><p>Raising Children, Racing Arizona</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lara Parpan—a freelance editor/writer  and avid triathlete from the Philippines and a longtime supporter of the Virlanie Foundation, a child care institution in Manila—attempts to finish her first Ironman, a race involving a 3.8k swim, a 180k bike, and a 42k run, to raise much-needed funds for the abandoned children in Virlanie’s care. She writes on what drives her to do this:</p><p>++++</p>
<p>I came to know of the Virlanie Foundation back in 1994, as a correspondent for the French news agency Agence France-Presse in Manila. My boss asked me to write about a French social worker  named Dominique Lemay who came to the Philippines and was so moved by the plight of Manila’s street children that he never left. I was humbled meeting Dominique. As an idealistic journalist in my mid-20s, I couldn't wait to leave the country. But here was this foreigner who decided to stay and help abandoned children. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I left Manila for eight years. When I returned in 2005, I found a job in publishing, as an editor for the Philippine edition of a French women’s magazine called Marie Claire. The local celebrity we were featuring on our cover, KC Concepcion, had just finished studies in Paris and was starting her career in showbusiness. She expressed a desire to take up a worthy cause, and because of the French connection, Virlanie and Dominique came to mind. Once again, my path crossed with the foundation. From 2007 to 2012, I spent four hours a week at Virlanie’s Magellan Learning Center as a volunteer, tutoring some 3rd and 4th grade kids in math. In 2014, I was invited to be on the Board of Directors. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Fitness and enjoying the outdoors have been my lifestyle for years now, though you can say I’m a late bloomer. I’ve been a gym rat since I was 25, a wakeboarder and waterskier since 28, took up running at 32, and turned into a a triathlete at 42. It’s triathlon—a sport that involves swimming, cycling, then running—that's now my first love when it comes to the active lifestyle. The feeling of accomplishing not one, but three sports just doesn’t contribute to my overall sense of and well-being, but an indescribable feeling of achievement. Sports does build character. Depending on the distance I swim, bike, and run, the training I do can be gruelling not just physically, but mentally too. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In five years since I started the sport, I have finished 35 triathlons consisting of 8 half-Ironmans (a half-Ironman which is also known as the Ironman 70.3 is a 1.9k swim-90k bike-21k run), 6 long-distance triathlons, 15 Olympic-distance races (1.5k swim-40k bike-10k run), and 6 sprint (short-distance) triathlons. These five years have not been injury-free. A bad landing while training on my mountain bike in August 2012 for an off-road triathlon, resulted in a torn anterior cruciate ligament in my left knee which required surgery in October 2012. I was sidelined from racing for seven months as I went through intense physical rehabilitation to get full use of my knee again. I resumed triathlon in June 2013, and haven’t stopped. Nor do I intend to, unless fate has other plans for me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On November 15, 2015, I am embarking on the biggest challenge of my triathlon life: my first full Ironman in Tempe, Arizona. In the Ironman, the triathlete swims 3.8 kms, cycles for 180 kms, and runs a marathon of 42 kms after. It’s an event that takes the seasoned professional triathletes eight hours to finish. Triathletes like myself, known as age-groupers (amateurs with day jobs who are more than weekend warriors and are passionate about the sport) finish the Ironman event anywhere between 10 to 17 hours. I hope to finish the Ironman in 16 hours. While the thought of taking on this distance is daunting, I have never felt better physically, emotionally, and mentally as I do now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I write this, the Ironman is barely three months away. I have been training since the start of the year and am averaging 15 to 18 hours of training each week. What keeps me going is not just the fulfilment of a personal goal and the support of family, but the children Virlanie cares for, particularly the 20  infants and toddlers who are in great need of care at this early stage in their lives. I was moved  by the story of Paul, who entered the Foundation as a newborn infant. Please click on the video of baby Paul, to find out more about his story and how Virlanie cares for him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope to raise P300,000 (US$6,000.00) for the Virlanie Foundation’s Babies and Toddlers’ Home. I will be most grateful if you can support me in this journey, by donating any amount you feel in your hearts to give to the kids. Think of this:           PhP 2,000 (USD 44) is enough to feed one baby for a month. One hundred percent of the funds raised through your help will go straight to them. </p><p>Virlanie stands on a solid, trusted, 23-year history of being a reliable partner of the country’s objectives in alleviating the plight of street children. I hope you can help me help them continue their invaluable work by donating to the Babies and Toddlers’ Home. These children, your pledges and donations, will add more significant meaning to racing and finishing Ironman Arizona to the best of my ability.</p><h2>Bank Transfer</h2><p>Virlanie's Bank Account Details:</p><p>Name: Virlanie Foundation, Inc.<br/>Bank Name: Banco de Oro - Vito Cruz Branch<br/>US Dollar Account No.: 104580108577<br/>Peso Account No.: 004580002426<br/>Euro Account No.: 304580112833</p><p>*For bank deposits, please email a copy of the deposit slip to <a href=""mailto:info@virlanie.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@virlanie.org</a> indicating that your donation goes to the #IronmanForVirlanie <span><i>campaign.</i></span></p><h2>Send a check</h2><p>Payable to Virlanie Foundation, Inc.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">4055 Yague Street, Barangay Singkamas, </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Makati City, Philippines 1204</span></p><p>*Kindly indicate that the donation is for the<span>#IronmanForVirlanie campaign.</span></p><p>For more information, you may send an email to <a href=""mailto:info@virlanie.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@virlanie.org</a> or call (+63-2-<span>895-3460).</span></p><h3>More ways to help:</h3><p>- Like our page on Facebook: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/virlaniefoundation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/virlaniefoundation</a></p><p>Share our <em>#Race4Virlanie #IronmanForVirlanie </em>campaign posts on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.</p><p>- Become a sponsor: <a href=""http://www.virlanie.org/get-involved/sponsorship/sponsor-a-child/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sponsor a child</a>-<a href=""http://www.virlanie.org/get-involved/sponsorship/sponsor-a-program/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sponsor a program</a></p><p>- Give <a href=""http://www.virlanie.org/__resources/userfiles/file/BTH%20Wish%20List.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">in-kind donations</a></p><br/></div>","Raising Children, Racing Arizona

</div></div>","Our Story Nearly a decade ago, in the Scottish Highlands, a dream was born.  The allure of the misty moors was irresistible.  Each distillery's tour guide educated us with his hearty brogue as we passed ruddy stills and learned about the near-mystical uniqueness of highland water.  
The quest was set!!!
Harnessing the power of water, we have found the perfect location!  Here, we are able to honor the rich history of distilling, millworks, and our region.  
Please join us as we breathe new life into this riverside mill!
This video shows some of what we have accomplished so far:

installation necessary to operate a distillery. 
This includes floor drains, forklift, sinks, tanks, mash tun, still, and
the list goes on…
We have the bare bones,
but we want to make a big difference for our community.   
We are reaching out for your partnership in making this site a true asset to the community.  What will your support enable?
 Building Facade Renovation – $5,000 – This will take more than a coat of paint!

Me, as a scholar…
When I was in
school; I assisted in the library during breaks and helping my fellow scholars
to locate literature, which they needed for their studies. I feel reading is one
of the cornerstones for youth development. I also worked in the school’s
cafeteria, and implemented systems to improve sales, quality of food, and the promotion
of a heathy diet.  
As a team
player I took part in sports such as: Volleyball and Softball. I believe that
team sports are an important activity, to be a balanced student. 

Unloading fertilizer at my school to make a garden.
My interests and more…
My free time is
spend with my family and friends, as it is important, for me, to spend time
with people you love and care for. I also love swimming and being outside in
nature.My family. 
I have 1 pig,
her name is “New Year”, and she is a pot-bellied pig. She is the most adorable thing
which you will ever meet. I also have 2 dogs called Jessy and Josei, a peacock
with brilliant tail feathers, 2 ducks, 1 pigeon and a couple of chickens.  
My pig New Year.I also have 4 cats,
its sounds like allot but all of them has a unique story behind them. To
mention one such story: Shadow, my youngest female cat, was rescued at the bus
station, when she was but a kitten. She was cold and starving, and I took her
home and she has stayed in our hearts ever since. I have so much more to tell,
which will have to wait for later.
Avani, my cat in action.In conclusion…
I would really
appreciate your support in making my dream come true. 

With warm regards,

Henk Wierenga

</h2>
<p>Due to the harsh 
austerity measures placed upon the people of Greece and the subsequent 
Capital Controls, the Greek citizens are struggling to cope while 
businesses which deal with international transactions have come to a 
stand-still. It is the aim of the PFG (Peoples Fund for Greece) program 
to help these businesses keep afloat and prosper despite the adverse 
conditions. At the same time PFG aims to improve the Greek GDP by 
providing <b>quality food &amp; drink products and tourism services</b> to people abroad.</p><p><br/></p>
<h2>What is this about?</h2>
<p>Political instability, unfair taxation 
system, economical chaos, financial dead end and constant pounding with 
negativity from the media have <b>driven more than 10,000 people in Greece 
to suicide</b> just in the recent years and the figure is constantly rising while masses of others immigrate to foreign lands! We are witnessing a severe change 
in civilization where numbers, politics and banks matter more than human
 life, rights and dignity. Capital controls  and no prospects for the foreseeable future have brought 
Greece to a standstill with most businesses on the edge of extinction.<br/></p><p>PFG is a program designed to support producers and suppliers of quality 
food &amp; drink  Greek products  with main focus the export as well as develop and support tourism services. PFG aims to <b>help keep businesses running and employ people</b>, while
 at the same time do it in a way to positively influence the Greek GDP 
in order for the country to afford its financial commitments and reach

<p>We shall use any amount we raise to its full 
potential but we propose an initial target of £850,000 to provide enough momentum for an immediate positive impact. <br/></p><p>PFG will be 
<b>based in the UK</b> and the fund will be used to create an infrastructure to
 assist the Greek beneficiaries in development, expansion, marketing, distribution and retail in various foreign markets in order to create self-sustained profits. Part of the fund will also be used for the purchase and delivery of your perks to local retail points.<br/></p><p><br/></p>
<h2>How is this special?</h2>
<p>The special advantage of PFG lies on the fact
 that it is a 2-way long term investment promise and <b>continuous

</p><p>I learned of the existence of Yarmouk’s legendary piano when
I visited the Yarmouk refugee camp last year for the 1st time.<br/></p><p>
The refugees of Yarmouk, whose population once exceeded 250.000 habitants, dwindled
throughout the Syrian civil war to 12.000. Yarmouk’s people have been under
siege since 3 years, it’s residents are deprived of food, water, electricity
and medical supplies. The suffering they have endured in the camp is reflected
in the voices I have heard during my first visits to the camp- See more here:<br/>
<br/>
<a href=""http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/pictures-life-and-death-yarmouk-992435842"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/pictures-life-and-death-yarmouk-992435842</a><br/>
<br/>
Another important voice I heard inside the camp is  the one of the incredibly talented musician Ayham Ahmad who played resistance songs and gave people hope during this deadly siege. But then 'evil fighters' infiltrated the camp, told him that 'music is a sin’, poured petrol on his piano, set it alight and theatened to kill him.<em></em> That's when Ayham realized that he could no longer stay in Syria, that he had to get his family to safety. <br/></p><p>Ayham is now part of the Syrian refugee crisis, he’s trying to make his way to Germany.<br/>
<br/>
The pianist has been sharing his ""Dairies Of a Traveller In The Sea"" on his
Facebook:</p><p>""I went out with my wife and my kids... but my parents refused to leave the camp.<br/> I went out of the camp to Damascus and it was the first time for me to make music out of the siege.<br/> I met my best friends.... we used to meet everyday before the siege in Yarmouk camp.<br/>
 And then I continued the journey to Homs and I paid a lot of money to 
get from Damascus to north Hamah but after that I was arrested for three
 days with my wife and my kids for the guilt of trying to travel in an 
illegal way.<br/> The court in Homs gave me a paper of release .""<br/>
<br/>
‘Boats of death’:<br/>
<br/>
“I went from Antioch to Izmir and the situation was terrible, the people were
sleeping in the streets and their blankets were just the sky, cause the hotels
were very expensive it costs 30 turkish pounds almost 15 US Dollars, per person
for each night, and no one like us just got out of a war zone can afford that
!, so we took the streets as shelters for our night, and here i met the
smugglers who are shipping the people to greece with an unbelievable way using
a tiny plastic boat, the percentage of the people that under risk of drowning
is 30 %.""<br/>
</p><p>'The smuggler':</p><p>

I visited the Yarmouk refugee camp last year for the 1st time.
The refugees of Yarmouk, whose population once exceeded 250.000 habitants, dwindled
throughout the Syrian civil war to 12.000. Yarmouk’s people have been under
siege since 3 years, it’s residents are deprived of food, water, electricity
and medical supplies. The suffering they have endured in the camp is reflected
in the voices I have heard during my first visits to the camp- See more here:

http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/pictures-life-and-death-yarmouk-992435842

Another important voice I heard inside the camp is  the one of the incredibly talented musician Ayham Ahmad who played resistance songs and gave people hope during this deadly siege. But then 'evil fighters' infiltrated the camp, told him that 'music is a sin’, poured petrol on his piano, set it alight and theatened to kill him. That's when Ayham realized that he could no longer stay in Syria, that he had to get his family to safety. Ayham is now part of the Syrian refugee crisis, he’s trying to make his way to Germany.

The pianist has been sharing his ""Dairies Of a Traveller In The Sea"" on his
Facebook:""I went out with my wife and my kids... but my parents refused to leave the camp. I went out of the camp to Damascus and it was the first time for me to make music out of the siege. I met my best friends.... we used to meet everyday before the siege in Yarmouk camp.
 And then I continued the journey to Homs and I paid a lot of money to 
get from Damascus to north Hamah but after that I was arrested for three
 days with my wife and my kids for the guilt of trying to travel in an 
illegal way. The court in Homs gave me a paper of release .""

‘Boats of death’:

“I went from Antioch to Izmir and the situation was terrible, the people were
sleeping in the streets and their blankets were just the sky, cause the hotels
were very expensive it costs 30 turkish pounds almost 15 US Dollars, per person
for each night, and no one like us just got out of a war zone can afford that
!, so we took the streets as shelters for our night, and here i met the
smugglers who are shipping the people to greece with an unbelievable way using
a tiny plastic boat, the percentage of the people that under risk of drowning
is 30 %.""
'The smuggler':
I got to know a smuggler named Abu Mohammed, and he seemed as a good religious
man or a man of morals if i could say so !, so i felt safer that he will never
play games, or cheat us, but he was just like the other smugglers all he care

<div>Hi all, Bunbury insight here.</div>
<div>We recently posted an idea to our 9000+ strong audience, asking if you would like to see a food truck festival themed event in Bunbury.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The response was absolutely overwhelming, with over 2500 pledging to attend.</div>
<div>And we are well underway, having sought quotes for all the big ticket items, and initial council approval, and vendors, all ready to go.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We now need to progress this idea and get it off the ground.</div>
<div>//We have calculated that a budget of roughly $3000-4000 will cover all of the incidentals, operating costs, insurance and more. Any less than this, and we risk potentially loosing money. Any more, and surplus will go towards Homelessness local charity causes. Please ignore the total pledge price of $5000USD. </div>
<div>AUD Cannot accept credit card payments, hence the currency type.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Our last limitation, is that of finance. Being a small startup, we don't have lots of cash to throw around like many established Bunbury businesses, and doing this on our own would literally send us beyond broke. We would love for nothing more than to pay for it with our own pockets, and we already are, but the fact is, that's not going to be enough.</div>
<div>An event of this size has it's costs - Insurance and public liability, event grounds costs, bond, application fees, risk management, lighting, the list does literally go on, and the cost goes up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We really want to host this free event for our community, free to all, and donate any proceeds from the event at the end of the night in the fight towards homelessness.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>We recognised this early on, and, not wanting to put our hand out to our audience asking for money, we approached many of Bunburys largest businesses, seeking reasonable and fair sponsorship (more than 30 to be precise.)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sadly, not a single company responded with a proposal, with exception for a kind man by the name of Duane W at a local photocopying sales company, offering his services to assist.</div>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We have some pretty cool perks for you.  Our featured perk is a featured business listing on Positive Business Directory.  20% of that contribution will go to the non profit of the businesses choice.  If you don't have a small business you can always gift this to someone who does.  We hope you like the other perks, but most importantly know that you are contributing to something that will make a difference in the world today.  We hope to see you at the launch party!!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Efficiency is Key!<br/>

methods work and which ones don't.  We have built the site to get the
 most out of each visitor.  We have set up processes and procedures for 
making it easy for small businesses to set up their business listing and
 we will be there to help them further if they don't understand how the 
site works.  We are done experimenting and the money we raise will be used very efficiently.  Over the next couple of years we expect to connect tens of thousands of small businesses with local non profits.  We expect to create new relationships with thousands of non profits and send them funds that we raise on their behalf.  A milestone we hope to reach in the near future is an announcement that we have raised a million dollars for non profits over the first couple years.  Wouldn't it be great if you were there in the beginning to help get that started?!<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457634098/mwpbmp9ncvnrbhthajs8.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b>Massey IT Consulting</b></p>
<p><b>Stephanie G. Massey, M.I.S.M.</b></p> Hello  to everyone, and welcome to my campaign. I am glad you could stop by and take a look at my business venture. I am asking you to help me start a consulting business from my home. <span>I know IT Consulting seems to be a kind different company to start, but it is a very exciting field to be in.  Let me explain it:<br/><br/>IT consulting is a service where customers can get advice on their different technology strategies such as either to use cloud storage or to store data on site. It also has to do with whether a customer has a software program in use to enter data/information, and help them determine through some steps if the software programs they are now using is giving them the most 'bang for their buck' or if they may need to change the software, re-write the software program or just keep it. <br/><br/>Other things that have to do with this type of consulting is that in the event the software is changed, then the consultant can explain exactly what the new software program can  and cannot do before purchasing it (which can be expensive to do) so the customer can make an informed decision. It is kind of like test driving the software by being able to look at it in a diagram/drawing specifically designed for their particular business plan. <br/><br/>Some of the other services I offer are for managing key players, or staff specifically when they have years of knowledge in their job and have to learn new software programs to do their work. Sometimes people do not like to change, so my consulting services have special advice  and proven techniques to get people to get along and be happy campers during the changes.  <br/><br/>The opportunity to raise money on the Indiegogo 
campaign is like a dream come true. And you can be a part of this business venture. I am offering sponsorship to anyone who is willing to make a significant contribution. That means if you like, I can list your name as a sponsor on all letter head communications, business cards, and on my website when it is built:) If you would prefer to be anonymous, that is okay too:)</span> <br/>
</div>Basically the start costs I am asking for  are very minimal, given I will be working form home and not leasing office space. All I really need is some computer equipment, some license fees, some office equipment and advertising money to generate business. The product line I am offering is knowledge, <br/><div> <br/>I in-vision to  build an innovative consulting business that will set a new standard. I ask you to please fund my campaign so I can begin a new chapter. <p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
