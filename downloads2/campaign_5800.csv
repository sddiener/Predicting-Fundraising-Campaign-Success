<p><b>My</b> <b>real „photographic journey“</b> started just one year ago after
I´ve bought my first DSLR. It had opened my eyes and I realised the real art of photography is about. I started to be fascinated by other

myself until I reached similar outputs. It was crazy! I wanted
it so much that I was dreaming about that, I was studying it on my
own and falling asleep with thoughts about „how the hell could I do that

<p><b>WHY</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>This campaign is my <b>ask for a help</b>. If I should
describe why it is important for me I would say that my life depends on
it. My biggest dream is to work with professional models and bring artistic
fashion photos into magazines. With the new camera I can continue my passion
and you´d help me to step into the world of real opportunities. But with my
current camera it´s hard to imagine that I could get professional job. You
can have all the talent of world, but without a professional-grade camera, you
will never get truly professional output. </p>
<p>To fulfill my dream working with
models, agencies and companies, <b>it´s absolutely vital to have professional
output </b>- <b>professional camera</b>. It all raises and falls on this point.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439659689/yboooqnht8opvmsdcxnh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><b>WHAT</b> <b>do I need</b></p>
<p>My biggest need is to <b>upgrade </b>my<b> photographic gear</b>, but the
gear is too expensive for me. Only with the help of others I can get this
really basic professional tool pack.</p>

<p>Now I´m working with older Canon 600D and few lenses. The
biggest difference between my camera and the Canon 5D is in their sensors
(APS-C vs. Full frame) and so in outputs of these two. For professional work
it´s absolutely necessary to work with full frame, but <b>my current situation
doesn´t allow me to make this on my own. </b>So I decided to try INDIEGOGO and

Search engines, social networks, email, and so on may seem free--and monetarily they are--but for each service <b>the true cost is data</b>. We sacrifice vast amounts of highly personal information in exchange for technologies that become increasingly ingrained in our habits, mindsets, and daily lives. <b>Big data poses big risks</b>, and in America today <b>there is a unique confluence of economic, political, and social circumstances</b> that make big data one of the most important issues facing our country. <i>Data and Power </i>aims to raise awareness and inspire public discussion--join me, join us, and <b>together let's create a better America</b>.</p> </div> <div> <h3>How You Can Help</h3> <p>To make <i>Data and Power </i>a reality, I need your help. I hope to raise $2,015 (a fitting sum!) with your support, and <b>I will match all donations up to $1,500</b>. Awareness, not profit, is the goal of this project. I will dedicate as much time, energy, and money as possible to making this book and community effort successful. </p>
<p>Please raise awareness for this campaign and project and share this campaign with your peers, friends, and family. <b>Your support is sincerely appreciated</b> and essential to the success of <i>Data and Power</i>!</p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>Funds will be used to publish <i>Data and Power </i>by self-publishing methods. Self-publishing has many advantages. Though traditional publishing generally takes between 6 and 18 months, <b>self-publishing can be done much more quickly</b>, which is especially important for a highly time-sensitive issue like big data in present-day America. <b>Self-publishing is also highly flexible</b>, allowing me to continually revise the book's content in light of future events. After thorough consideration and research of many companies, I have chosen Infinity Publishing and plan to purchase the following publishing packages, for a total of $1,127:</p> <ul>
<li>manuscript evaluation: $179</li>
<li>softcover print publishing: $599</li> <li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">eBook publishing: $349</span></li>
</ul>The manuscript evaluation gives detailed critiques and typographical edits from a professional editor and will ensure that <i>Data and Power</i> is ready for the main stage. By <b>publishing both in print and through eBooks</b>, I hope to reach a wider audience and reflect the changing culture of readers. A January 2014 Pew Research poll showed that <b>50% of Americans over 18 have an e-reader or tablet</b>: <a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/01/16/e-reading-rises-as-device-ownership-jumps/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/01/16/e-reading-rises-as-device-ownership-jumps/.</a>
</div><div>In addition, I plan to purchase a marketing package:<br/><ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">publicity campaign: $2,000</span></li></ul>Through this publicity campaign, Infinity Publishing will provide significant professional help to ensure that <i>Data and Power </i>will reach a large number of targeted media outlets and potential customers. The many resources I have consulted have stressed that <b>marketing is especially important</b> to a book's success, so I believe such a package is essential to this project.</div> <div> <h3>Financial Summary</h3> <p>Donations will be used for specific and critical aspects of the project. If this campaign is successful in raising $2,015, I will have $1,805.60 to spend assuming all paperback copies are claimed (the difference is the cost of buying and shipping the copies). As stated above, I will also contribute $1,500 of my own money for a <b>total of $3,305.60 in funds</b>. I plan to spend this money as follows:</p> <ul>
<li>publishing costs: $1,127 (see breakdown above)</li>
<li>marketing costs: $2,000 (publicity campaign)</li>
<li>website cost: $158.90 ($149 for website yearly plan, $9.90 for domain name registration)</li>
</ul>Therefore, my <b>total expected costs are $3,285.90</b>, with $19.70 remaining for small unforeseen costs or shipping cost changes. I will cover any other unexpected costs with my own money--I hope my commitment to this project, both in money and in effort, will reassure you that <i>Data and Power </i>is a project well worth supporting.</div><div>I will also cover any Indiegogo fees at the close of the campaign (4% if the goal is reached). </div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3> <p>I value transparency very highly and so I do not hesitate to acknowledge the <b>many significant challenges </b>involved in this project. I overcame many obstacles even before launching this campaign: conducting rigorous research, forming a thesis, writing a book, filming a video, and the list goes on and on. Still, many challenges remain:</p> <ul>
<li>finalizing <i>Data and Power</i> (additional editing, updating material with current events if necessary)</li> <li>publishing (cover design, formatting)</li>
<li>finishing painting for cover image (see website for details)</li>
<li>generating interest in the project and sales for the book</li>
</ul>If you are reading this, <b>thank you for your interest</b>. This project has proven difficult and involved, but I hope to convince you that I am capable of bringing it to full fruition. I am someone who enjoys taking on difficult tasks and above all, <b>I am willing to work tirelessly to make <i>Data and Power </i>a reality</b>. </div><h3>About Me</h3><p>I am a student at Stanford University interested in a wide range of topics. Outside of academics, I enjoy golf, tennis, good food, and spending time with my family. To give you a sense of my background, here is a brief resumé:</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>

<li><p>college acceptances to Stanford University and Harvard University</p></li>
</ul>I hope the list above assures you that I passionately pursue my interests and will dedicate myself fully to each and every task. In asking for your money and support in this campaign, I want you to be confident that I am ready to complete this project <b>efficiently and effectively</b>. </div>
</div><h3>Impact</h3><p>Why does <i>Data and Power </i>matter? Why is big data so important to the future of America? What's the point?</p><p>Big data has great power for good, but <b>with great power comes great danger</b>. Because of big data's shocking ubiquity and the apparent lack of public awareness about its more troubling consequences, this danger is a real threat. Increasingly, we become accustomed to sharing highly personal information with unknown third parties. </p><p>The confluence of big data, economic inequality, changes in campaign finance law, and lack of awareness is causing a concentration of power in the hands of the few, and the American public is at risk. <i>Data and Power </i>is my passionate attempt to inform and inspire our country to seriously consider the realities of an ever more technological world.</p><p>As a member of the young generation affected most, I am especially concerned. We have never known a world without cell phones, computers, and the Internet. We have never known a world in which it seemed risky to send a credit card number over the World Wide Web. Our world has a bright future, and one in which big data plays an essential role, but we must be aware of its dangers and <b>we must demand of our government and corporate leaders transparency, security, and privacy</b>. We must work together, as a connected people, and use big data itself to craft a prosperous future. <b>Are you with me? Let's change the world.</b></p></div>","In Brief Big data has dramatically changed our society and mostly in positive ways, but security and privacy measures lag far behind the cutting edge resources we take for granted. Search engines, social networks, email, and so on may seem free--and monetarily they are--but for each service the true cost is data. We sacrifice vast amounts of highly personal information in exchange for technologies that become increasingly ingrained in our habits, mindsets, and daily lives. Big data poses big risks, and in America today there is a unique confluence of economic, political, and social circumstances that make big data one of the most important issues facing our country. Data and Power aims to raise awareness and inspire public discussion--join me, join us, and together let's create a better America.   How You Can Help To make Data and Power a reality, I need your help. I hope to raise $2,015 (a fitting sum!) with your support, and I will match all donations up to $1,500. Awareness, not profit, is the goal of this project. I will dedicate as much time, energy, and money as possible to making this book and community effort successful. 
Please raise awareness for this campaign and project and share this campaign with your peers, friends, and family. Your support is sincerely appreciated and essential to the success of Data and Power!

Funds will be used to publish Data and Power by self-publishing methods. Self-publishing has many advantages. Though traditional publishing generally takes between 6 and 18 months, self-publishing can be done much more quickly, which is especially important for a highly time-sensitive issue like big data in present-day America. Self-publishing is also highly flexible, allowing me to continually revise the book's content in light of future events. After thorough consideration and research of many companies, I have chosen Infinity Publishing and plan to purchase the following publishing packages, for a total of $1,127: 
manuscript evaluation: $179
softcover print publishing: $599 eBook publishing: $349
The manuscript evaluation gives detailed critiques and typographical edits from a professional editor and will ensure that Data and Power is ready for the main stage. By publishing both in print and through eBooks, I hope to reach a wider audience and reflect the changing culture of readers. A January 2014 Pew Research poll showed that 50% of Americans over 18 have an e-reader or tablet: http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/01/16/e-reading-rises-as-device-ownership-jumps/.
In addition, I plan to purchase a marketing package:publicity campaign: $2,000Through this publicity campaign, Infinity Publishing will provide significant professional help to ensure that Data and Power will reach a large number of targeted media outlets and potential customers. The many resources I have consulted have stressed that marketing is especially important to a book's success, so I believe such a package is essential to this project.  Financial Summary Donations will be used for specific and critical aspects of the project. If this campaign is successful in raising $2,015, I will have $1,805.60 to spend assuming all paperback copies are claimed (the difference is the cost of buying and shipping the copies). As stated above, I will also contribute $1,500 of my own money for a total of $3,305.60 in funds. I plan to spend this money as follows: 
publishing costs: $1,127 (see breakdown above)
marketing costs: $2,000 (publicity campaign)
website cost: $158.90 ($149 for website yearly plan, $9.90 for domain name registration)
Therefore, my total expected costs are $3,285.90, with $19.70 remaining for small unforeseen costs or shipping cost changes. I will cover any other unexpected costs with my own money--I hope my commitment to this project, both in money and in effort, will reassure you that Data and Power is a project well worth supporting.I will also cover any Indiegogo fees at the close of the campaign (4% if the goal is reached).   Challenges I value transparency very highly and so I do not hesitate to acknowledge the many significant challenges involved in this project. I overcame many obstacles even before launching this campaign: conducting rigorous research, forming a thesis, writing a book, filming a video, and the list goes on and on. Still, many challenges remain: 
finalizing Data and Power (additional editing, updating material with current events if necessary) publishing (cover design, formatting)
finishing painting for cover image (see website for details)
generating interest in the project and sales for the book
If you are reading this, thank you for your interest. This project has proven difficult and involved, but I hope to convince you that I am capable of bringing it to full fruition. I am someone who enjoys taking on difficult tasks and above all, I am willing to work tirelessly to make Data and Power a reality. About MeI am a student at Stanford University interested in a wide range of topics. Outside of academics, I enjoy golf, tennis, good food, and spending time with my family. To give you a sense of my background, here is a brief resumé:





“America’s Top Young Scientist” 2010: $25,000 grand prize winner of the
Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge



Veterans of Foreign Wars Voice of Democracy Essay Contest: First Place in Wisconsin 2013 ($1,750 scholarship), Fifteenth Place nationally 2013 ($2,000 scholarship), Second Place in Wisconsin 2012 ($1,500 scholarship)

National Merit Scholar ($2,500 scholarship)
Brookfield Academy Five Star Merit Distinguished Scholar Award (scholarship of $7,000 per year for four years)
Cum Laude Society Inductee
composer of two orchestral works, which were premiered by the Milwaukee Youth Symphony Orchestra in 2010 and 2014
Mock Trial Team: varsity leader, Regional Champions 2012-2014, Second in State 2013, Best Attorney award 2013
college acceptances to Stanford University and Harvard University
I hope the list above assures you that I passionately pursue my interests and will dedicate myself fully to each and every task. In asking for your money and support in this campaign, I want you to be confident that I am ready to complete this project efficiently and effectively. 
ImpactWhy does Data and Power matter? Why is big data so important to the future of America? What's the point?Big data has great power for good, but with great power comes great danger. Because of big data's shocking ubiquity and the apparent lack of public awareness about its more troubling consequences, this danger is a real threat. Increasingly, we become accustomed to sharing highly personal information with unknown third parties. The confluence of big data, economic inequality, changes in campaign finance law, and lack of awareness is causing a concentration of power in the hands of the few, and the American public is at risk. Data and Power is my passionate attempt to inform and inspire our country to seriously consider the realities of an ever more technological world.As a member of the young generation affected most, I am especially concerned. We have never known a world without cell phones, computers, and the Internet. We have never known a world in which it seemed risky to send a credit card number over the World Wide Web. Our world has a bright future, and one in which big data plays an essential role, but we must be aware of its dangers and we must demand of our government and corporate leaders transparency, security, and privacy. We must work together, as a connected people, and use big data itself to craft a prosperous future. Are you with me? Let's change the world.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3><strong>What My Art is About</strong></h3>

<h3>About Vermont Studio Center</h3>
<p><a href=""https://vermontstudiocenter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Vermont Studio Center</a> is an artists' residency situated along the banks of the Gihon River in the historic village of Johnson, Vermont. It is the largest international artists' and writers' residency program in the United States. It's highly competitive and offers extensive facilities including a full printmaking studio, photography studio, sculpture studio, mediation houses, and a yoga studio. In addition VSC offers a large community of artists and writers, and all meals and room and board are included.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545263127/tro6s0nvow3c176ck2x6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What is a Residency?</h3>
<p>An artist's residency is a of a retreat for artists where they are offered time and space away from their daily lives to focus on their work. Residencies such as VSC offer studio space (much larger than my usual), community, and additional facilities and technical support that are hard to come by in the ""real"" world. Residencies are an important space where artists can take time to focus on their work and make strides that are not always possible in your daily life.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545263976/hkzzkc0tkeqfh0nqd1ie.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Why I Need Your Help</strong></h3>
<p>Although VSC has generously offered me both a merit grant and a work study scholarship, the remainder of the fee for my <strong>room and board + studio + facilities is $2300</strong>. To be honest this is far less than I spend on rent, food, and studio in New York City, so it's a great deal. However, my acceptance to VSC comes at a very unexpected time. I originally applied for a spring or summer residency but had listed January as a 3rd option. </p>
<p>I am being offered the residency at a time that comes right on the heals of my last residency at <a href=""https://www.wassaicproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Wassaic Project</a>, where I have been an artist and residence twice (once in 2016 and once this September).</p>
<p>Having spent a good portion of my savings there and having come back to a slower than usual pace with freelance work, this opportunity comes at a very awkward time financially.</p>
<p>However, due to the competitive nature of the program, and due to the immense benefit I hope to gain from the experience, I feel it is an opportunity I cannot pass up. Also, I am soon planning to leave the freelance world for the full time work force for awhile, so this may be my last opportunity to take a residency for a few years at least.</p>
<p>In addition to the cost of the residency itself, I need to raise additional funds to help pay bills while I'm away (although I plan to offset that cost partially by subletting my apartment). I also need to pay for art supplies and travel. So I am hoping to raise an addition <strong>$500 </strong>for art supplies, i.e. paper, paint, canvas, epoxy clay, and another <strong>$600</strong> for additional bills and <strong>$200</strong> for my flight to Vermont.</p>
<p><strong>So the total I am hoping to raise is $3600 by January 6th</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><i>Any additional funds will be gratefully accepted in order to make even more work!</i></strong></p>
<p><i><strong>While I am there I plan to make a new body of works on paper, experiment with some printmaking/etching, and also create a new body of small sculptures, including rainbow babies and other celestial bodies.</strong></i></p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Benefits I Hope to Gain From The Residency</strong></h3>
<p>One of the main benefits of a residency such as this is just having the time and head space to think and to come up with new ideas. New York City is always an exciting yet draining mad rush of socializing, working, commuting and generally running around. So having the space to get away and think and make your work is very important. Additionally, my tiny space in New York City is only 100 square feet, while the studios at Vermont Studio Center are as large as 300 square feet. Having more space to spread out and really step back from the work is immensely helpful. In fact the first time I attended The Wassaic Project my practice grew to include installation and sculpture on a scale I had never created before.</p>

<h3>What's Different From Other Residencies I've Done?</h3>
<p>This program has additional facilities and technical support for a number of mediums. It also has fully prepared and paid meals, so I will have one less thing to worry about outside of making work. It is also a larger program, so I will have an opportunity to connect with a much wider group of artists and also writers, as they have a writing program as well. Also, it's in the mountains of Vermont! So will be a different and exciting area for me to be inspired by.</p>

<br/><h3>It Started With One Pot</h3> <p>For the past 5 years, I have been dyeing and selling yarn.  I started in my kitchen with one small pot and have grown to the back deck, using propane burners and 62 quart pots.  My name is Melissa, I am A Tree Hugger's Wife from Juneau, Alaska and I need your help to make my dyeing process more efficient and take it to the next level of productivity. </p>
<p>In order to keep the shops that I sell to stocked, I need to have a dye studio that is not outside in the elements, where I can store all my supplies in one space and I have access to water and sewer without hauling buckets.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1268055/files/20150304093856-FullSizeRender__1_.jpg?1425490736"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>I am personally investing in my expansion plan by working with an architect, a structural engineer and contractors to have a studio built.  I need your help to purchase the equipment that will make my process more efficient and increase production.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>What I need and their cost:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Skeiner to wind yarn from cones:  $805</li>
<li>Proofing Cabinet:  $900</li>
<li>Propane Cylinder:  $200</li>
<li>Ventilation system and installation labor:  $2500</li>
<li>Stainless Steel 62 Quart dye pots (quantity of 3 at $100 each):  $300</li>
<li>Propane Burners:  $300</li>
<li>Stainless Steel work tables (quantity of 3 at $300 each):  $900</li>
<li>Stainless Steel Sink and faucet hardware:  $850</li>
<li>Stainless Steel Shelving Racks (quantity of 4 at $70 each): $280</li>
<li>Electronic Scale:  $50</li>
<li>Heavy Duty Yarn Swifts (quantity of 2 at $525 each):  $1050</li>
<li>Consumable Supplies:  $1000</li>
<li>Drying Racks:  $500</li>
<li>Sheet pans for dyeing with proofing cabinet (quantity of 12):  $145</li>
</ul>
<div>Total funding for everything I need would be fantastic but I feel that I have set a realistic goal of $7500 to be able to purchase the bulk of what I need to get me going in the next direction of efficient production.    </div>
<div>Due to the nature of hand dyeing dyeing with high acidity, I need high quality equipment that will not stain or rust or corrode.  In the past, I have used the readily available aluminum pots that I can buy locally.  Unfortunately, they do not last with the acid that I use and eventually develop pinholes, which then allows the dye bath to drip onto the propane burner and corrode it too.  Investing in high quality equipment will decrease the amount of times I have to replace things.  </div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The other obstacle I have is that there is a shortage of used equipment in our town, add that to the fact that you can not drive out of Juneau so we have to ship everything up here or put a vehicle on the Ferry and take a couple weeks to go to Anchorage or Seattle to try to find used restaurant equipment which honestly does not work out very well with our family schedule of school and farm chores.   </span></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Now for the FUN part...Perks!</b>  I am so excited for every single one of these perks, I have put a lot of thought into what the most sought after items are in the knitting world and collaborated with a few of my favorite artists to bring you some amazing perks at all levels.  All perks include domestic shipping.  Some perks are ready to be shipped now.  We have a few more perks to add as the campaign progresses so be sure to check back often!</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>$10 contribution level gets you a set of 4 hand made Jade and Swarovski crystal stitch markers.  They're small, get a set for everyone in your knitting group! Did you know that Jade is the Alaskan state gem?  Have a little bit of Alaska delivered to you! </li>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>My Mission</h3>
<div>Over the past two years, I have been slowly switching my yarn bases to all 100% USA made yarns.  It is important to me to be proud of the quality of yarn I offer and I love being able to tell customers that my yarn is made in America.  I have worked with Jane from the Yolo Wool Mill in northern California for wool processing, Cestari and Kraemer Yarns for finished yarns, as well as two farmers in northern California for my wool sources, Jim has Southdown, Hampshire and Dorset sheep and Evan has my beloved Columbias.  It has become a project that I fully believe in, I want to support America's farmers and invest in their future.  I need your help to continue doing this.  Investing in my company through this crowdfunding project will help me invest in them.  <br/>
</div> <p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>If I Don't Meet My Goal</h3> <p>I have a priority list of things that are *must have* items.  After Indiegogo takes their cut and the credit card processing takes theirs, my portion will go towards my priority list whether I make my goal or not.  I am well versed in starting small and not overextending myself so I am no stranger to waiting to fully grow while continuing to work as hard as I can and use what funding I do get to increase productivity in the meantime.  My must have list includes things that are absolutely necessary in the studio:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Ventilation System &amp; Installation Labor</li>
<li>Stainless Steel Sink &amp; Faucet Set Up</li>
<li>Propane Cylinder</li>
<li>Propane Burners</li>
<li>At Least One Stainless Steel Work Table</li>
<li>At Least One Set of Stainless Shelving Racks for organization</li>
</ul>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I get it that you might not be able to contribute at this time. I really do.  There are other ways that you can help me that will make a big difference.  I need your help getting the word out.  Please share this on facebook, twitter, instagram, with your church knitting group, your friends, anyone you think might be interested.  The beauty of crowdfunding is word of mouth and the community pulling together to make it happen.  There are buttons to use to share on social media, indiegogo has made it easy!  </p>
</div></div>","It Started With One Pot For the past 5 years, I have been dyeing and selling yarn.  I started in my kitchen with one small pot and have grown to the back deck, using propane burners and 62 quart pots.  My name is Melissa, I am A Tree Hugger's Wife from Juneau, Alaska and I need your help to make my dyeing process more efficient and take it to the next level of productivity. 
In order to keep the shops that I sell to stocked, I need to have a dye studio that is not outside in the elements, where I can store all my supplies in one space and I have access to water and sewer without hauling buckets.  



I am personally investing in my expansion plan by working with an architect, a structural engineer and contractors to have a studio built.  I need your help to purchase the equipment that will make my process more efficient and increase production.     What I Need & What You Get What I need and their cost:


Skeiner to wind yarn from cones:  $805
Proofing Cabinet:  $900
Propane Cylinder:  $200
Ventilation system and installation labor:  $2500
Stainless Steel 62 Quart dye pots (quantity of 3 at $100 each):  $300
Propane Burners:  $300
Stainless Steel work tables (quantity of 3 at $300 each):  $900
Stainless Steel Sink and faucet hardware:  $850
Stainless Steel Shelving Racks (quantity of 4 at $70 each): $280
Electronic Scale:  $50
Heavy Duty Yarn Swifts (quantity of 2 at $525 each):  $1050
Consumable Supplies:  $1000
Drying Racks:  $500
Sheet pans for dyeing with proofing cabinet (quantity of 12):  $145

Total funding for everything I need would be fantastic but I feel that I have set a realistic goal of $7500 to be able to purchase the bulk of what I need to get me going in the next direction of efficient production.    
Due to the nature of hand dyeing dyeing with high acidity, I need high quality equipment that will not stain or rust or corrode.  In the past, I have used the readily available aluminum pots that I can buy locally.  Unfortunately, they do not last with the acid that I use and eventually develop pinholes, which then allows the dye bath to drip onto the propane burner and corrode it too.  Investing in high quality equipment will decrease the amount of times I have to replace things.  
The other obstacle I have is that there is a shortage of used equipment in our town, add that to the fact that you can not drive out of Juneau so we have to ship everything up here or put a vehicle on the Ferry and take a couple weeks to go to Anchorage or Seattle to try to find used restaurant equipment which honestly does not work out very well with our family schedule of school and farm chores.   


Now for the FUN part...Perks!  I am so excited for every single one of these perks, I have put a lot of thought into what the most sought after items are in the knitting world and collaborated with a few of my favorite artists to bring you some amazing perks at all levels.  All perks include domestic shipping.  Some perks are ready to be shipped now.  We have a few more perks to add as the campaign progresses so be sure to check back often!

    My Mission
Over the past two years, I have been slowly switching my yarn bases to all 100% USA made yarns.  It is important to me to be proud of the quality of yarn I offer and I love being able to tell customers that my yarn is made in America.  I have worked with Jane from the Yolo Wool Mill in northern California for wool processing, Cestari and Kraemer Yarns for finished yarns, as well as two farmers in northern California for my wool sources, Jim has Southdown, Hampshire and Dorset sheep and Evan has my beloved Columbias.  It has become a project that I fully believe in, I want to support America's farmers and invest in their future.  I need your help to continue doing this.  Investing in my company through this crowdfunding project will help me invest in them.  
 
    If I Don't Meet My Goal I have a priority list of things that are *must have* items.  After Indiegogo takes their cut and the credit card processing takes theirs, my portion will go towards my priority list whether I make my goal or not.  I am well versed in starting small and not overextending myself so I am no stranger to waiting to fully grow while continuing to work as hard as I can and use what funding I do get to increase productivity in the meantime.  My must have list includes things that are absolutely necessary in the studio:


Ventilation System & Installation Labor
Stainless Steel Sink & Faucet Set Up
Propane Cylinder
Propane Burners
At Least One Stainless Steel Work Table
At Least One Set of Stainless Shelving Racks for organization

    Other Ways You Can Help I get it that you might not be able to contribute at this time. I really do.  There are other ways that you can help me that will make a big difference.  I need your help getting the word out.  Please share this on facebook, twitter, instagram, with your church knitting group, your friends, anyone you think might be interested.  The beauty of crowdfunding is word of mouth and the community pulling together to make it happen.  There are buttons to use to share on social media, indiegogo has made it easy!",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who is HIM?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hello art enthusiasts, my name is Boden Him, a Studio Art grad from Cal State Long Beach. I am currently a full time artist at California Kings Tattoo. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It has been two years since my first exhibit. With all the anxiety and pressure following up to the opening reception, I had no idea at the time how the event would turn out. To my surprise, it was a success as people gathered under one roof to appreciate the arts and music. </p>
<p>I have been fortunate to have this opportunity arise again. Every first Tuesday of the month, the talented staff at Digital Installers orchestrates a SONOS listening party, with a particular genre of music playing in their state of the art showroom. I have been asked to be the featured artist for the month of June, with reggae music as the theme. What better way to kick off the summer as we vibe to the groovy sounds of roots, rock, and reggae? </p>
<p>This gathering will take place at the Digital Installers' showroom in Long Beach, CA. The event is simply designed for creatives to come together, network and have a good time.</p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Why I'm here.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I am here to ask for your help in funding my second exhibit. The gallery will feature a comprehensive collection of oil paintings, charcoal portraits, money art, and tattooed pig skin. Your contributions will help provide the necessary elements to bring this show to life. $1,500 needs to be raised by June 1st. A portion of gallery sales will be donated to NHCC-New Hope for Cambodian Children. </p>
<br/><div>
<h3>What's the purpose?</h3>
<p>Since my last show, I have been overwhelmed and blessed with the support and feedback from my family, friends, and social media. I have had the pleasure of chatting and meeting many people from across the world. Recently I met a humanitarian worker who once lived in the U.S., but has given up everything to volunteer in Cambodia to educate and heal children living with HIV/AIDS. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the charity. </p>

<div> <h3>The Six Comforts book, a limited-edition conceptual work of text and image by artist Christopher Gustave, is now available for pre-order.</h3>
<p>Christopher Gustave’s immense artist book “The Six
Comforts”, c.344 pages in total, more than 308 full color plates, will be printed as a
tightly-limited edition. We sold over 85 books in little over a month. We are continuing the pre-sale now. Contribute $100, receive Christopher Gustave's last art work: The Six Comforts, and get your name on the Acknowledgement page before it goes to press.</p>
<p>Gustave conceived of the Six Comforts as a method for living in
response to personal tragedy, primarily the death by heroin overdose of his
best friend, Daniel Brack, in San Francisco, on September 13th, 1996. Over the
next several years, he focused his creative output in book-design, conceptual
art, collage and assemblage within a framework of this “sorting construct” of
the Six Comforts: key components of a method of living in opposition to
super-cultural alienation, and unrecoverable loss.</p>
<p><i>""The Six Comforts are Home, Sleep, Work, Love, Food and
Self.</i> <i>The Six
Comforts’ is a sorting construct I formulated around the summer of 1997. At
that point in my life I had just endured a blistering spate of profoundly bad
luck—death, divorce, unemployment, homelessness… you name it—and I was in a
deep state of emotional turmoil and mental resignation… really heart-broken and
bereft of hope. Life nearly unendurable and all that. </i><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">However, given a little time, it was pretty clear that, in
spite of all of this, I was not going to just stop living. I had resigned
myself to the Nietzschean formula (“That which does not kill us…”). Part of my
survival regimen at that time was to simply sort out what I most needed in
order to keep on going and just focus on those basics; get myself back into a
healthy, sane and productive place. So, those “basics” became ‘The Six
Comforts’."" — Christopher Gustave, 2002.</i></p>
<p>The work “The Six Comforts” existed primarily in book-page
spreads, diptychs, comprised of poetical texts and, aphorisms layered with
photographic elements. It can be read forward to back, back to front, and
starting anywhere in the middle. Pages from the unbound book were exhibited and
sold in St. Louis galleries between 1999 and 2002. Other works from this series
include a Six Comforts “screen” assembly the size of a room, The Six Comforts as
a series of hand-pulled woodcuts, The Six Comforts Panels (assemblage of found
objects with encaustic) and finally culminating in a concept-album in
collaboration with several talented St. Louis musicians.</p>
<p>
On January 17<sup>th</sup>, 2014, Christopher Gustave was found dead in his
apartment of a overdose of anti-depressants. Within days of his passing,
hundreds of his friends and supporters organized and began gathering together
his works of art. A fundraising memorial was held at MAD Art Gallery in St.
Louis, with the purpose to raise money for his eight-year-old daughter, Sophia.
We are continuing that purpose in perpetuity with the initial release of this book
The Six Comforts, which will mark the completion of Gustave’s final, and
perhaps most challenging and important, work of art.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>This book embodies a spiritual quest against the backdrop of modern industrial oppression.</h3>
<p>The experience one has of reading the book is extraordinary. Gustave tears down megalithic conceptions foisted upon us by a vapid culture and replaces them with sharp, emancipating anti-slogans. While the punk-rock ideals inherent to Gustave’s practice keep everything on the edge, there is redemption on every page.</p>
<p>Please share this campaign with everyone you know and love.</p>

</div></div>","We are going to press. This is an amazing accomplishment. In just a few weeks we will need to determine if we can print 1000 books for $16,840, or can if we can only afford to print 500 for $12,550. With funds from the first campaign (igg.me/at/sixcomforts) combined with this current campaign we have just about $14,500 (as of 5/26/2015). So we are just $2,340 from our ideal goal. It's a testament to Chris's character and the greatness of his friends that we have gotten this far! Thank-you. This is a limited edition book, will be a valuable collectors item, so please order now, support our campaign, and enable Proof Publishing to start out with a great release.The initial contract with the printer in toronto has been signed. Once the proof is delivered in a few weeks time, we will at that point need to decide if we will do 500 or 1000 books. The book is now 344 pages (16 signatures) on 135 lb. paper, casebound, smyth sewn, colored endpapers, dust jacket and embossing on front, back and spine. (Cover material will be finalized with the proof). NEW GOAL FOR THIS CAMPAIGN: $4,500.
 The Six Comforts book, a limited-edition conceptual work of text and image by artist Christopher Gustave, is now available for pre-order.
Christopher Gustave’s immense artist book “The Six
Comforts”, c.344 pages in total, more than 308 full color plates, will be printed as a
tightly-limited edition. We sold over 85 books in little over a month. We are continuing the pre-sale now. Contribute $100, receive Christopher Gustave's last art work: The Six Comforts, and get your name on the Acknowledgement page before it goes to press.
Gustave conceived of the Six Comforts as a method for living in
response to personal tragedy, primarily the death by heroin overdose of his
best friend, Daniel Brack, in San Francisco, on September 13th, 1996. Over the
next several years, he focused his creative output in book-design, conceptual
art, collage and assemblage within a framework of this “sorting construct” of
the Six Comforts: key components of a method of living in opposition to
super-cultural alienation, and unrecoverable loss.
""The Six Comforts are Home, Sleep, Work, Love, Food and
Self. The Six
Comforts’ is a sorting construct I formulated around the summer of 1997. At
that point in my life I had just endured a blistering spate of profoundly bad
luck—death, divorce, unemployment, homelessness… you name it—and I was in a
deep state of emotional turmoil and mental resignation… really heart-broken and
bereft of hope. Life nearly unendurable and all that. However, given a little time, it was pretty clear that, in
spite of all of this, I was not going to just stop living. I had resigned
myself to the Nietzschean formula (“That which does not kill us…”). Part of my
survival regimen at that time was to simply sort out what I most needed in
order to keep on going and just focus on those basics; get myself back into a
healthy, sane and productive place. So, those “basics” became ‘The Six
Comforts’."" — Christopher Gustave, 2002.
The work “The Six Comforts” existed primarily in book-page
spreads, diptychs, comprised of poetical texts and, aphorisms layered with
photographic elements. It can be read forward to back, back to front, and
starting anywhere in the middle. Pages from the unbound book were exhibited and
sold in St. Louis galleries between 1999 and 2002. Other works from this series
include a Six Comforts “screen” assembly the size of a room, The Six Comforts as
a series of hand-pulled woodcuts, The Six Comforts Panels (assemblage of found
objects with encaustic) and finally culminating in a concept-album in
collaboration with several talented St. Louis musicians.

On January 17th, 2014, Christopher Gustave was found dead in his
apartment of a overdose of anti-depressants. Within days of his passing,
hundreds of his friends and supporters organized and began gathering together
his works of art. A fundraising memorial was held at MAD Art Gallery in St.
Louis, with the purpose to raise money for his eight-year-old daughter, Sophia.
We are continuing that purpose in perpetuity with the initial release of this book
The Six Comforts, which will mark the completion of Gustave’s final, and
perhaps most challenging and important, work of art.

This book embodies a spiritual quest against the backdrop of modern industrial oppression.
The experience one has of reading the book is extraordinary. Gustave tears down megalithic conceptions foisted upon us by a vapid culture and replaces them with sharp, emancipating anti-slogans. While the punk-rock ideals inherent to Gustave’s practice keep everything on the edge, there is redemption on every page.
Please share this campaign with everyone you know and love.

point mirrors to reflect sunlight on the Sun Mandala and try to burn
the tower to the ground. We will be bringing hundreds of small
mirrors to the desert and would like to encourage others to bring
their own mirrors to the burn. Be aware that the target is going to
get VERY bright, so those of you who will be there will want to bring the darkest sunglasses
you have with you!</p>

2228
years after Archimedes is said to have destroyed an attacking Roman
naval fleet using mirrors, we will bring the Sun Tower to the playa
and try to set it on fire the same way.

30+ foot tall climbable tower will have a sun shaped mandala at the

Hi, I'm wizzard, and this is my 17th year bringing art to the playa. I've wanted to use sunlight to start a big burn for several years, and I look forward to finally seeing it happen.
 The Sun Tower team is composed of some of the same  skilled and talented people who created and brought Cruz the Wave to Burning Man last year and the Mayan TRIcycle to BM 2012. This year our team is smaller than for either of those projects, and we are donating our time and money toward making the tower a reality. However, we can't do it all on our own and need your financial help to make it possible.
This is the tallest structure that I've brought to Black Rock City and I can't wait to climb it!  On such a large flat space as the playa, getting 5' above the ground really changes your perspective. When you are 20' or 30' up, the view is amazing!

gars – un Y instruit à l’école privée – qui brave moins quarante pour aller
écouter une octogénaire tenancière d’un after-hour
clandestin lui raconter sa vie.
Dans la chambre exiguë d’un demi-sous-sol,
les souvenirs d’une existence à contre-courant jaillissent comme on regarde les
montagnes à partir de la Haute-Ville : dans le désordre. Elle parle, il écoute.
De cet équilibre naît un sentiment étrange. Quelque chose comme l’affection
fulgurante et éphémère d’une rencontre de voyage.
Entre ces allers-retours dans le temps,
qui nous font revivre l’âge d’or d’un bar de passage de la rue Cartier,
s’ouvrent des fenêtres dévoilant avec humour le processus de création d’un
théâtre documentaire. Mme G., c’est
une histoire épique recopiée dans un cahier Canada, dont les meilleurs bouts
sont écrits dans la marge.
ON A TUÉ LA UNE !
La jeune compagnie On a tué la une ! puise son inspiration dans l’actualité,
présente ou passée, et des acteurs plus ou moins connus qui la composent. Ses
créations s’articulent à partir d’une démarche inspirée du journalisme
d’enquête, qui sert de piste de décollage à la fiction. Le collectif croit en
la force des histoires au théâtre. Mme G
est son premier projet, dont une première étape de travail fut présentée avec
succès lors des Chantiers 2015 du Carrefour International de Québec. Soutenue
par une bourse de la Société des auteurs et compositeurs dramatiques du Québec
et par Première Ovation, la pièce sera officiellement créée en clôture de la
saison 2015-2016 de Premier Acte, à quelques coins de rue du bâtiment ayant
jadis abrité la Grande Hermine.

</h3> <p></p>
<p>Curatorial collective VERBureau delivers an art project examining the socio-political history of ice cream bringing communities together and celebrating cultural difference. Unfolding from February till May, the project has already started with an exhibition <i>Who Owns the Cone? </i>successfully held at Likky Ruph, New York in February 2016. It will be followed by a big exhibition and collateral events programme <i>Pokey Hat</i> taking place at New Glasgow Society as part of the visual arts festival Glasgow International in April 2016. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Elements of social history spanning popular culture, immigration, LGBTQ and women’s emancipation, regeneration and community can be charted through the Italian ice cream cafés that first appeared throughout Glasgow and New York from 1880s to 1930s. Emphasising the social, cultural and political importance of the cafés, <i>Who Owns the Cone? </i>and <i>Pokey Hat</i> aim to establish a dialogue between these two cities significant to the Italian diaspora and trace how the ice cream cafés have catalysed shifts in local culture across the world. The project entails newly commissioned works and reflect on the collective experience of contemporary urban environments through ice cream.</p>
<p>The overall project aims to unfold complex local histories; raise discussion about the coexistence of differing values, attitudes, lifestyles, faiths and traditions; critically consider the notions of identity, family, community and home; and forge new social connections.</p>
<h3>Pokey Hat</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><span></span></span></p>
<p>The main part of the project, <i>Pokey Hat</i>, will take place at New Glasgow Society in April 2016 as part of Glasgow International – a city-wide biennial that attracts over 200 000 visitors over the course of three weeks. Glasgow’s connection with ice cream parallels that of New York, which we explored earlier, but retains its own distinct history. Alongside positive tales of burgeoning youth culture and tolerance are darker stories of failed regeneration schemes, slum clearances and the gang violence of the notorious “ice cream wars” of the 1980s. Hence ice cream provides an illuminating lens through which to explore notions of immigration, community, regeneration and national identity - all of which are at the forefront of current political agendas in Scotland in the wake of the independence referendum, Commonwealth Games and ongoing refugee crisis. </p>
<p>Pokey Hat will present five new commissions from artists whose research-driven practices examine the social, political and cultural landscape of the past and present: Cooking Sections (Daniel Fernández Pascual and Alon Schwabe), Carrie Gooch, Julie Hill, Rosie O’Grady and Rachel Sharpe. The artistic responses to the history of ice cream will be diverse, ranging from the transformation of invasive plants into ice cream flavours and celebration of queer culture to the exploration in socio-political anxieties through the horror genre.</p>
<p>The events programme will invite people of all backgrounds and ages to connect through making and sharing. The events include storytelling and recipe sharing workshops, a talk on the socio-politics of ice cream in an urban environment, and a screening of archival film footage followed by feature length films. The new works, artistic interventions and events will extend beyond the gallery, thus taking Pokey Hat to different neighbourhoods across Glasgow. The other venues include Centre for Contemporary Art, Jaconelli’s Café and Café Peña.</p>

This means that we will have an immense amount of support throughout the project and we will be able to deliver it as successfully as our previous endeavours, including <i>Who Owns the Cone?</i> at Likky Ruph.</p>
<p>The exhibition and events in Glasgow will be held in many different locations and involve several organisations and individuals in different capacities. Whilst this could potentially make the project complicated to manage, with good planning and seamless communication these several partnerships are an incomparable resource. Invigilators and event hosts will be present at all times to ensure the safety of visitors, participants and artworks. The works will be packed, transported and installed professionally and accompanied by detailed condition reports and all project components will be covered by a public liability insurance.

<h3>ME</h3>
<p>I am a 65 year old artist living in Corvallis, MT. I have exhibited many years ago in Allan Stone Gallery in New York, Roy Boyd in Chicago and Los Angeles, Simard Helm Gallery in Los Angeles and most recently in 2011 at Robert Berman Gallery in Los Angeles. I have shown in numerous group shows both nationally as well as internationally. I have painted murals in the USA as well as Thailand and China. I am not a famous artist yet I am not unknown.</p>
<p>While living and exhibiting in Thailand in the early 90's my beautiful daughter Dao Ann Slagter was born to her Thai mother and my wife, Gulap. We returned to the states when she was 2 years old so she could have a better life. I took a break from my daily practice of painting to open a mural company as I felt that I would be able to spend more time raising my daughter. It went well enough to support and raise my family, not in any high style but well enough to live. We left Los Angeles and moved to Montana in 2006. I wanted my daughter to have ""roots"" and values that she could fall back on as an adult and to see that beauty really does exist. Although it has been financially very difficult here we enjoyed a very nice life until 7 months ago when my daughter passed in an auto accident at 17 years of age. A devastating and life changing event for my wife and I. I started seriously painting again at my daughters insistence 6 years ago and some of that work can be seen on my website as well as the work exhibited at Robert Berman Gallery last year.</p>
<p>This project titled ""CALL TO DUTY"" is the first work I have done since my daughter's death. In my 65 years I have watched aghast as our country has degenerated into a nation of sleeping and complacent people. Our morals, values and integrity as a nation have slipped away. We are now the most aggressive nation on the face of the earth. Many people are waking to the fact that our government has become too large and uncontrollable and they also are becoming aware of the massive corruption from the federal to the local level.<br/><br/>Our loss of liberty as a nation and loss of personal liberty continues unhindered on a daily basis. We seem to be too asleep to stop it. We are on the brink of a massive world war as well as teetering on the precipice of a complete financial collapse nationally and globally. There is constant talk in the streets and alternative media of an impending civil war and massive social unrest which will be squelched mercilessly by an ever expanding internal police force with the help of US military and potentially UN troops. The Constitution has been shredded and deemed insignificant by many of our politicians. We have given complete control of the US currency to a group of private world bankers who are taking away homes, jobs and industry from millions of US citizens and the people of the world. <br/><br/>We are all aware of the famous meme of the ""wake up slap"". In this series my images are a ""wake up slap"" and a ""call to duty"" for many of our politicians, bankers, non governmental employees, corporate heads, military and the American people. In some cases they will be of specific people who have changed the world in less than positive ways that we are uniformed of. Other images will be of legislation and some of the concepts that have caused our loss of liberties. All images will have information in the text that informs the viewer of the reason for the slap. Viewers can take the opportunity to research this information for themselves and make informed decisions about the state of our country. For instance United Nations Agenda 21 and United Nations Codex Alimentarius. Many of us have never heard of these two agendas, and even fewer understand their full implications. Both have been approved by our government and implementation is taking place. The former will ultimately result in the complete loss of sovereignty for our nation and the formation of a global currency and one world global government. The latter takes away the right of the people to feed themselves in a natural and healthy manner. Both have hugely detrimental  programs of eugenics and control as there ultimate goal. As you awaken you will see how just these two agendas are being implemented in your local area as well as nationally and globally.</p>

<h3>FUNDING</h3>
<p>All funding for this project will be used for the design, development, printing and shipping of this project. Even if the goal is not reached I intend to finish this project funded or unfunded and prints will be available on my website and other outlets on the web. Currently 5 prints are finished and can be seen here and in the ""gallery"" section of this site.<br/>The majority of the funds will be used to print the posters using offset lithography. This has to be done in large runs and cannot be printed on a one print basis. The other 2 signed limited editions can be done as single prints as they are funded.<br/> <br/>To print the posters I need a minimum of $1000.00 per each image as they are printed with offset lithography and so must be all printed at the same time.<br/><br/>In the event the goal is not meant I will print what posters the budget allows and they will be sent to contributors. I will print the posters in the order of the list below. <br/><br/>If the goal is not met and the budget does not allow for the printing of any posters, all contributors at those reward levels will receive (1) unsigned, open edition, 9"" x 12"" fine art print, my choice, in lieu of the poster.<br/><br/>All contributors of rewards for limited edition fine art prints are guaranteed they will receive their reward.<br/><br/>Shipping costs are included with the contribution. No additional costs for shipping.<br/><br/>All art will be mailed in tubes and sent FedEx inside the USA and USPS Internationally.<br/><br/>If my goal is reached I will start the printing and sending rewards as soon as i receive the funds. All artwork and printing files will be finished by the funding date. This should be about 8 weeks into the project. I will mail out rewards as each is printed. I will keep all contributors posted on the upcoming printing and mailing dates.<br/><br/>When the editions are sold out, no new prints will be made.</p>

<h3>IMPACT</h3>
<p>Your contributions to this project will help wake up America to just how many loses of rights and liberties that have already occurred and of future dangers to our great nation. There is only one way this nation can retain it's greatness and attempt to avert the impending disaster. That is by becoming AWAKE and INFORMED  and then taking action. The most important action is to help wake up your friends and neighbors. Shout from the rooftops and help save this great nation before it is to late. And that day is approaching rapidly.<br/><br/>This is your chance to own a piece of fine art that documents the complete overturning of humanity on a global scale. While our times are dangerous and uncertain I still feel privileged to have lived long enough to see the amazing awakening that is happening globally.<br/><br/>Even if you can't contribute financially please share and spread these images across the internet and the globe as a way to ""do your duty"" and help inform a sleeping but ever awakening public.<br/><br/></p>

I am a 65 year old artist living in Corvallis, MT. I have exhibited many years ago in Allan Stone Gallery in New York, Roy Boyd in Chicago and Los Angeles, Simard Helm Gallery in Los Angeles and most recently in 2011 at Robert Berman Gallery in Los Angeles. I have shown in numerous group shows both nationally as well as internationally. I have painted murals in the USA as well as Thailand and China. I am not a famous artist yet I am not unknown.
While living and exhibiting in Thailand in the early 90's my beautiful daughter Dao Ann Slagter was born to her Thai mother and my wife, Gulap. We returned to the states when she was 2 years old so she could have a better life. I took a break from my daily practice of painting to open a mural company as I felt that I would be able to spend more time raising my daughter. It went well enough to support and raise my family, not in any high style but well enough to live. We left Los Angeles and moved to Montana in 2006. I wanted my daughter to have ""roots"" and values that she could fall back on as an adult and to see that beauty really does exist. Although it has been financially very difficult here we enjoyed a very nice life until 7 months ago when my daughter passed in an auto accident at 17 years of age. A devastating and life changing event for my wife and I. I started seriously painting again at my daughters insistence 6 years ago and some of that work can be seen on my website as well as the work exhibited at Robert Berman Gallery last year.
This project titled ""CALL TO DUTY"" is the first work I have done since my daughter's death. In my 65 years I have watched aghast as our country has degenerated into a nation of sleeping and complacent people. Our morals, values and integrity as a nation have slipped away. We are now the most aggressive nation on the face of the earth. Many people are waking to the fact that our government has become too large and uncontrollable and they also are becoming aware of the massive corruption from the federal to the local level.Our loss of liberty as a nation and loss of personal liberty continues unhindered on a daily basis. We seem to be too asleep to stop it. We are on the brink of a massive world war as well as teetering on the precipice of a complete financial collapse nationally and globally. There is constant talk in the streets and alternative media of an impending civil war and massive social unrest which will be squelched mercilessly by an ever expanding internal police force with the help of US military and potentially UN troops. The Constitution has been shredded and deemed insignificant by many of our politicians. We have given complete control of the US currency to a group of private world bankers who are taking away homes, jobs and industry from millions of US citizens and the people of the world. We are all aware of the famous meme of the ""wake up slap"". In this series my images are a ""wake up slap"" and a ""call to duty"" for many of our politicians, bankers, non governmental employees, corporate heads, military and the American people. In some cases they will be of specific people who have changed the world in less than positive ways that we are uniformed of. Other images will be of legislation and some of the concepts that have caused our loss of liberties. All images will have information in the text that informs the viewer of the reason for the slap. Viewers can take the opportunity to research this information for themselves and make informed decisions about the state of our country. For instance United Nations Agenda 21 and United Nations Codex Alimentarius. Many of us have never heard of these two agendas, and even fewer understand their full implications. Both have been approved by our government and implementation is taking place. The former will ultimately result in the complete loss of sovereignty for our nation and the formation of a global currency and one world global government. The latter takes away the right of the people to feed themselves in a natural and healthy manner. Both have hugely detrimental  programs of eugenics and control as there ultimate goal. As you awaken you will see how just these two agendas are being implemented in your local area as well as nationally and globally.

<div>Hi, I'm Meg!  I'm a ceramic artist and educator based in Thunder Bay, Ontario and I follow my heart in <i>all</i> that I do. </div>
<div>For years, I worked hard as an Outdoor Educator and it's felt effortless to apply those specialized skills to my passion for ceramic arts.  As a self-taught artist, I'm also lucky to have been mentored by an amazing local potter who is now a dear friend. </div>
<div>Over the years, I've created studio space in two commercial locations, but leasing has never been an ideal option for many reasons. Because of this I converted a tiny room in my basement into a semi-functional workspace. However, orders to fill and a growing wait list of students means I can no longer meet the demand to both teach and produce in my current space. </div>
<div>So... I'm building a new studio in my <i>own backyard!  </i>This will happen one way or another BUT I would LOVE to have your help on this journey!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>With gratitude and excitement from all of us: </p>
<p>Scott, my partner and <i>dedicated studio assistant</i>; Jala, our daughter and <i>young apprentice</i>; the huskies,<i> the namesakes of Dog Paw</i>; and me, the <i>soulful trailblazer</i>. xo</p>

<div>
<p>Building a studio from scratch is incredibly exciting for so many reasons, but most importantly, it will provide a creative and functional workspace for me and for my students, and ensure that I'm just a few steps away from my growing family. </p>
<p>I am already partnered with many local vendors and organizations (Sweet Escape Bakery, Both Hands Pizzeria, International House of Tea, Belluz Farms, and The Loop Clothing as well as non-profit Roots to Harvest) but it can be a struggle to meet the demand because of space and therefore time constraints. </p>
<p>With your help, I'll be able to create more wares, fill orders more efficiently, and welcome more students into the studio. </p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>The new studio will be 20' x 30', with an earthy and simplistic design. It will also be cost effective, sustainable, eco friendly and beautiful, matching with my values. I am asking for 50,000 which will be the cost of the building:</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact - Why does it matter?</h3>
<div>
<p>A profound question for me while preparing this campaign has been: Why would people help me build my dream?</p>
<p></p>
<p>~In my pottery you will find meaningful, savvy and functional designs, each their own piece of art. </p>
<p>~I offer a space for folks to play with and realize their own artistry, take creative risks and invest in their own well-being. </p>
<p>~I always get excited when I can support others' living their dream and that will be something you will experience through supporting me and participating in crowd-funding ... I will be living my dream. </p>
<p>In a lot of ways this project is small and local but I believe the impact of it goes much further than that. The realization that an artist is in each of us can alter the way we relate to the world, to our own innate creativity therefore affecting confidence and creative courage.  I have learned this about myself and reaching toward this goal helps me reach others with these ideas through classes but also through the<i> idea</i> that my passion for pottery can become an <i>abundant</i> career for me and my family. <br/></p>

<p><i>""This fall I responded to an ad on my Facebook page…it was Kismet! I had been thinking of taking pottery classes once again, but, hadn’t really done too much research. Meg Sheepway of Dogpaw Pottery was taking students!</i></p>
<p><i>Having never heard of Meg, I checked out her website and fell in love! Meg’s pottery, her philosophy, her love of life had me.</i></p>
<p><i>Now, after three sessions, I have found a new release…I will never be a production potter, that is not my desire. My desire is to add something to my life that enhances me…</i></p>
<p><i>Meg’s positivity and encouragement has made such a difference in what I do at the wheel. Her warm and welcoming classes have made my evenings so enjoyable. Visits from her adorable daughter, a warm nuzzle from one of her dogs, and the companionship of the other students is something quite unique. Conversations are inspiring and insightful, humour and laughter makes the atmosphere in her studio nothing like I’ve ever experienced.</i></p>
<p><i>I thank Meg for all she has given me, a new sense of well being and worth. Nothing I create is frowned upon and each piece is celebrated!</i></p>

PICKING-UP Locally? No Problem.  NOW choose the Perk WITHOUT the shipping cost!



Short Summary

Hi, I'm Meg!  I'm a ceramic artist and educator based in Thunder Bay, Ontario and I follow my heart in all that I do. 
For years, I worked hard as an Outdoor Educator and it's felt effortless to apply those specialized skills to my passion for ceramic arts.  As a self-taught artist, I'm also lucky to have been mentored by an amazing local potter who is now a dear friend. 
Over the years, I've created studio space in two commercial locations, but leasing has never been an ideal option for many reasons. Because of this I converted a tiny room in my basement into a semi-functional workspace. However, orders to fill and a growing wait list of students means I can no longer meet the demand to both teach and produce in my current space. 
So... I'm building a new studio in my own backyard!  This will happen one way or another BUT I would LOVE to have your help on this journey!



With gratitude and excitement from all of us: 
Scott, my partner and dedicated studio assistant; Jala, our daughter and young apprentice; the huskies, the namesakes of Dog Paw; and me, the soulful trailblazer. xo




www.dogpawpottery.ca
   What We Need & What You Get

Building a studio from scratch is incredibly exciting for so many reasons, but most importantly, it will provide a creative and functional workspace for me and for my students, and ensure that I'm just a few steps away from my growing family. 
I am already partnered with many local vendors and organizations (Sweet Escape Bakery, Both Hands Pizzeria, International House of Tea, Belluz Farms, and The Loop Clothing as well as non-profit Roots to Harvest) but it can be a struggle to meet the demand because of space and therefore time constraints. 
With your help, I'll be able to create more wares, fill orders more efficiently, and welcome more students into the studio. 



The new studio will be 20' x 30', with an earthy and simplistic design. It will also be cost effective, sustainable, eco friendly and beautiful, matching with my values. I am asking for 50,000 which will be the cost of the building:



Metal Roof - $2,900
Lumber - $4,650
Concrete - $8,750
In-floor heat - $3,075
Hardware - $1,560
New/Used windows and doors - $3,200
Labour - $11,400
Insulation - $5,270
Sheeting - $1,400
Drywall - $2,750
Stairs and Railing - $2,100
Siding - $1,600
Drafting Services - $2,000
Total: $50,655




I will also be purchasing the following large equipment when money allows.  If there is additional money that comes in, it will help me buy the following (in order):
- 8 new wheels @ $1000/wheel ($8000)
-1 slab roller @ $1000
-1 pug mill (reclaiming/wedging clay) @ $6000

I am so entirely committed to this plan that I am going to build this studio and get this equipment no matter what.  Because of this, I have decided to do a FLEXIBLE campaign where every dollar counts toward my end goal.

<p><strong>Update: </strong>We reached our goal in what may be a record: 3 hours!! Whoa. We're totally floored.</p>
<p>But even though we reached our goal, we still need your help! We pretty much wiped out our funds to make 2013 happen, so we will need to raise a lot of money for next year. And we still have some really great perks! Everything we raise from here on out will go towards 2014. And we're gonna need it: 2014's probably going to cost about $20,000! So please keep supporting SF's biggest and best trans pride event!!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>The San Francisco Trans March is SF's largest transgender Pride event and one of the largest trans events in the entire world. It's always the Friday of Pride weekend and thousands of people attend. This year the March will be June 28 in Dolores Park and there's lots of big fun, huge celebration and awesome community building just waiting for you!</p>
<p>The theme for this year's March is ""Trans March X: Celebrating a Decade of Change.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""TMX 2013: A Decade of Change logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/876585/pictures/full/20130617140835-TMX_FB_COVER_PHOTO_UNICORN2.jpg?1371503320"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get!</h3>
<p>The March is organized and run entirely by volunteers from the community. Our Board of Directors and a committed group of community members work hard to ensure that everthing we do supports our <a href=""http://www.transmarch.org/mission"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mission</a> and <a href=""http://www.transmarch.org/vision"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vision</a>. The event itself is the result of hard work by many, many people doing things big and small.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we need more than just volunteers to make the March happen. The event costs about <strong>$18,000</strong> and that covers things like city permitting fees, stage rental, the sound system, ASL interpretation, the trolley for those with mobility issues, the youth/elder brunch and a whole mess of other expenses. We were hit with some additional fees this year from the city, including a $1000 increase in the park rental fee and a new fee of $700 to have EMTs on site. We usually raise money through grants and sponsorships, but we still need quite a bit directly from the community to make the event happen in the style to which we would like you to grow accustomed.</p>
<p>In return for your generous donation, you'll receive some pretty great rewards including stickers, posters, invites to our appreciation party, shirts, and maybe more if we manage to meet certain fundraising goals.

</div></div>","Update: We reached our goal in what may be a record: 3 hours!! Whoa. We're totally floored.
But even though we reached our goal, we still need your help! We pretty much wiped out our funds to make 2013 happen, so we will need to raise a lot of money for next year. And we still have some really great perks! Everything we raise from here on out will go towards 2014. And we're gonna need it: 2014's probably going to cost about $20,000! So please keep supporting SF's biggest and best trans pride event!!
 
Who are we?
The San Francisco Trans March is SF's largest transgender Pride event and one of the largest trans events in the entire world. It's always the Friday of Pride weekend and thousands of people attend. This year the March will be June 28 in Dolores Park and there's lots of big fun, huge celebration and awesome community building just waiting for you!
The theme for this year's March is ""Trans March X: Celebrating a Decade of Change.""
 

 


What We Need & What You Get!
The March is organized and run entirely by volunteers from the community. Our Board of Directors and a committed group of community members work hard to ensure that everthing we do supports our mission and vision. The event itself is the result of hard work by many, many people doing things big and small.
Unfortunately, we need more than just volunteers to make the March happen. The event costs about $18,000 and that covers things like city permitting fees, stage rental, the sound system, ASL interpretation, the trolley for those with mobility issues, the youth/elder brunch and a whole mess of other expenses. We were hit with some additional fees this year from the city, including a $1000 increase in the park rental fee and a new fee of $700 to have EMTs on site.

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>The Nemeth Art Center was founded in 1977 when a group of local residents raised the funds to purchase a collection of European paintings dating to the Renaissance. These works, now known as the Gabor and Edith Nemeth Study Collection, have been enjoyed and treasured by the Park Rapids community ever since.</p>
<p>During our off season months and when the paintings are not exhibited, they are stored in our on-site storage room. Currently, that room is woefully inadequate and the long term health of the paintings is in jeopardy. In the new storage system, each painting will get its own designated cubby, with paintings staying as close to vertical as possible while not touching each other. The system, designed by a senior art proprietor of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, will help minimize future damage to the priceless paintings. If you give to this campaign, you will be helping to ensure the continued health of this collection.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your contribution will go towards the supplies needed to build this structure. Wood, screws, carpet and other building materials will be purchased with the donations. Brian Stieler, of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, has graciously volunteered his time in designing and building the structure.</p>
<p>For your donation, you can get such perks as a Nemeth Art Center T-Shirt, an original print from our upcoming Midwest Multiples juried show, or your name on a plaque recognizing our primary contributors.</p>

The gypsy culture has its roots in India, but made a long journey through Spain and eastern Europe and so on, that is why it became a very strong, vivid culture. As travelers, their palace was not a building, but their well kept tradition, like fortune telling and card reading. </span></span></p>

The idea is to combine three things to create something unique: my arts, tarot cards and YOU. This project is in my heart, because I find it very important that art and magic can get some space in everyday life to make it more beautiful and colourful.
I put a lot of energy into this project for the past years and we are very close to complete it together on Indiegogo!
 
Let me invite You to The Gypsy Palace ! 
I am drawing for many years and I read the tarot cards as well. These things supported my life and at one point there were ready to support each other too. I flicked through my pictures and I realized they will find their perfect places as tarot cards. My aim was to create a whole tarot card deck, 78 cards, in high, artistic, handmade quality while keeping the traditional meaning of the Rider Waite Tarot. 
I dug deeper in the meanings to find the perfectly matching picture and of course, I had to create lots of new versions. I had to create the design to the cards, choosing colours, drawing a frame, making the pictures ready to print on the computer, creating a special handmade font for them and write the names on each of them in four languages (English, German, Italian, Hungarian) and so on.
It was all worth it. Now they are ready to communicate with You and to come alive in your hands.
I am proud of them and I would be pleased if You feel like being a part of making it come true.
 
And all for You!
Your role has a great importance, because your donations will go straight into printing costs. I want to print 1000 packs in high quality. That means it will be a limited edition card set.
And from the printer they will go straight to your home as You wish! 
 
Worth to read the perks for special offers!
You can own the original Gypsy Palace Tarot deck, or the Special Editions with handmade magic bags, signed and personalized for You. 
But there is more here: for your support I also offer my knowledge about reading the tarot cards, to give something personal. Did you ever had a card reading? 
Check the perks for more information and choose for yourself or for a person You love!
 

About The Gypsy Palace Tarot philosophy
I choose the name The Gypsy Palace for this deck, for two reasons: first, because the colours, the atmosphere of my pictures has a flavour of the gypsy art, and secondly, because card reading has a great tradition in gypsy culture. The gypsy culture has its roots in India, but made a long journey through Spain and eastern Europe and so on, that is why it became a very strong, vivid culture. As travelers, their palace was not a building, but their well kept tradition, like fortune telling and card reading.

Ich bin Nora Huszka, ein Künstler aus Ungarn, ich wohne in Berlin, aber im Moment reise ich durch Italien, die Geburtsstätte der Tarot-Karten, um mein Projekt abzuschließen.
 Die Idee ist, drei Dinge zu kombinieren, um etwas Einzigartiges zu schaffen: meine Kunst, Tarotkarten und Dich.  Dieses Projekt ist in meinem Herzen, weil ich es sehr wichtig finde, dass Kunst und Magie mehr Platz im Alltag bekommt.
 Ich habe viel Energie und Liebe in dieses Projekt gesteckt und wir sind sehr nah, es zusammen zum Leben zu erwecken!
 
 Ich lade Sie ein zum  Gypsy Palast!
 Ich bin seit vielen Jahren am zeichnen und ich lese auch die Tarot-Karten.  Diese Dinge unterstützten mein Leben und nun können beide einander unterstützen.  Ich schaute durch meine Bilder und habe erkannt, dass sie perfekt zu den Tarot-Karten passen.  Mein Ziel war es, eine ganze Tarot Kartenspiel, 78 Karten, in hoher, künstlerischen, handgemachter Qualität zu schaffen, während Ich die traditionelle Bedeutung aus dem Rider Waite Tarot Karten beibehalte.
 Ich grub tiefer in den Bedeutungen, die perfekt passenden Bilder zu finden und natürlich musste ich viele neue Versionen erstellen.  Ich musste das Design mit den Karten erstellen, die Farben auswählen, einen Rahmen gestalten, erstellung einer speziellen handgefertigten Schrift und die Namen auf jeden von ihnen in vier Sprachen (Englisch, Deutsch, Italienisch, Ungarisch).
 Es war es wert.  Jetzt sind sie bereit, mit Ihnen zu kommunizieren und können in Ihre Händen lebendig werden.
 Ich bin stolz auf sie und ich würde mich freuen, wenn Sie ein Teil dafür beitragen.
 
 Und das alles ist für Sie!

<h3><strong>A California Artist with a Detroit Attitude.</strong></h3>

<p>WorldFest is a fantastic festival brought on by the nonprofit Towards Freedom (501(c)3) in Woodley Park, California (near Los Angeles). It's one of the most fun events of the year with three stages of live music, compassionate living, environmental and healthy living speakers, amazing vegan food, and fun. </p>
<p>Each year the non-profit barely breaks even paying for all the expenses a festival of this size needs. We rent tents and booths, security, advertising, rental of solar power equipment, sanitization service, water trucks, recycling trash services, all while depending on a small team of volunteers passionate about making this festival the best ever each year.</p>
<p>This year we'd like to introduce and fund an additional venue, Art Avenue. This tent is a special art show that is only accepting artwork that related to the themes of WorldFest. That means only work that brings up the issues of animals, the environment, and social justice. The artwork is carefully curated with local artists, and they are urged to explore these issues on their crafted materials. It's become a very amazing exchange between artists and our activist curating team. Artists get to sell their original work with a small percentage donation going back to the festival.</p>
<p>However, funding a tent like this requires sponsorship. We tried asking a wide variety of businesses and non-profits to help fund the tent, but it's been difficult and unsuccessful. We realized in order for this to work we will need our friends to help this happen. We have some really great rewards for your generosity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Funding is needed to pay for the rental the tent for the day, as well as tables and chairs. We also need to construct museum style walls (from reclaimed materials) and use low wattage LED lighting. We'll be needing additional security to keep the artwork safe. We'll also need additional materials to decorate the tent and attract visitors, including specimen lighting and construction of our seating area (which includes seats and cushions). We will also need additional funding for the entire festival to help cover costs like advertising and rental of Woodley Park.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Your donation will help us make this project this year, as well as each and every year afterwards. This will give artists motivation to create more activist inspired artwork for people to enjoy each year. This helps a lot of people by increasing awareness of vital issues by the artistic expression, as well as increasing a market for activist art as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

<p style=""font-family: Times; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"">My work revolves around ways of seeing while challenging the boundaries and traditions of both sculpture and photography. In my early career, I have had the opportunity to exhibit in London and in my hometown Mexico City. Currently, I am a New Haven artist and am excited to announce that I will take part in this year’s New Haven City-Wide-Open Studios Festival. During this month-long festival, not only will my studio be open to the public, but I am also planning to create my biggest, most ambitious piece yet. Screen Realities will be a room-size (about 3 x 7 m) installation where it will be possible for viewers to be actively submerged in them. The installation will allow visitors to walk within a maze of curtains and overlapping images. Having an image literally create space and swallow its viewer has always been a dream of mine, but for this dream to become reality I need your help.</p>

I will be dedicating the next 2 months to do everything from sewing each curtain, to producing the digital files, constructing the temporary walls, and installing every bit of equipment: all in order to create this ambitious artwork. However, without any kind of outside help this unique piece may never see the light of day. So I am turning to you, my strongest supporters, to ask for contributions. In exchange, I will be offering a free artist talk at the exhibition to all contributors. For the first 20 people who donate $50 or more, I will send out limited edition signed postcards.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Slam Richmond is a multi-faceted organization, including a weekly open mic, workshops for aspiring writers, and an adult and youth slam poetry team. This writing community has become a voice for artistically suppressed young adults, allowing them the opportunity to be heard every Saturday. Here, scribbles in notepads and quiet journal entries are transformed into award winning prose.</p>
<p>Slam Richmond is the only venue in Richmond, Virginia offering a poetry slam competition weekly for both youth and adults in separate categories. Youth poets compete by writing original poems and reciting them for an audience and judges randomly selected from our crowd. Winners of each competition qualify for a chance to represent Richmond, Virginia at Brave New Voices youth competition, which is held annually in a different city. Once the teams are selected (5 poets and 2 coaches), they rehearse all summer and then compete to show the world a peek into Virginia’s artistic and literary arsenal!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Funds for gas. Slam Richmond annually drives to the competition. Driving is, believe it or not, cheaper.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>

<li>In the four years of this program, it's become clear that most youth have not traveled outside of Virginia and those that have have not gone far. This experience shows them the world beyond their homes and confirms that they do have a place in the world at large.</li>
<li>Youth find themselves re-purposed from this program. Many intended dropouts have gone to college. Those who didn't remained became mentors, coaches and continue to work towards maintaining the program so that other youth may enjoy the same expeirence.</li>

In the four years of this program, it's become clear that most youth have not traveled outside of Virginia and those that have have not gone far. This experience shows them the world beyond their homes and confirms that they do have a place in the world at large.
Youth find themselves re-purposed from this program. Many intended dropouts have gone to college. Those who didn't remained became mentors, coaches and continue to work towards maintaining the program so that other youth may enjoy the same expeirence.

<br/></div>","Illustrated
by Andreas Ganther, this wimmelbook was developed by learning a lot of the
construction business. We worked together with some of these guys who are
building these fascinating machines in reality. With much focus on details this
book is a great experience for children as well as for construction-loving
adults.The Idea
was to show the viewer the history from the past until to the future of
construction. Teeming with lots of funny details, this book invites you to
discover all the amusing stories in each of its five pictures. 
You can
even look look for some special chararcters. They are hiding inside the
different pictures and are waiting to be discovered by you. Have fun!

At the
Beginning there were only ideas, influenced by interviews with guys of the
construction business and an amazing visit of the bauma 2013 in Munich. Out of
the first drawing with graphit pencils site for site came to life.
The next
step was to bring them on pc and to colorize them with beautiful colors. 
Now it’s up
to you to support us, to get this book produced. It will be a great experience
for all the children and maybe some adults fascinated by construction to
discover the history from the past to the future.
Why we need your support
We don’t sell
this wimmelbook to a publisher. We want to produce it on our own. But
self-producing is very expensive. So we need your help. Our goal is to realize
this great wimmelbook on our own. We are a stong team, have great ideas and are
willing to bring BAGGERMANIA to reality. With you as backup it will hopefully don’t
be a problem.

More than a Moment, a Movement


It wasn't until I went to Ferguson, MO on Saturday, August 16th that I understood the importance of the work happening. You can read about my initial experience in a blog post, here.
I quickly realize that this was not the America that I knew.
I've live-tweeted all of my experiences as well. You can also see a gallery of pictures and videos I've taken here.
This is not a moment in American history, this is a movement -- a movement demanding systemic change and justice.
The 3 Goals
This project has three defined goals.

Goal 1: Create Platforms to Share Information and Strategize

Thus far, we've created:



thisisthemovement.org which is the landing page for the daily newsletter

the daily #Ferguson newsletter to keep everyone informed and connected

hashtagferguson.org to assemble the twitter streams in one place

We need the resources to sustain these efforts and to continue building them to full fruition. We have gotten great traction thus far -- in just 4 days, the mailing list has over 700 members and has gotten 2,000 hits indepedent of the mailing list members.

We are also working to create a central platform for on-going announcements and a mechanism to link activists on the ground while protesting and to ensure that activists can travel to appropriate sites.

Goal 2: Create Resources and Structures to Link Allies with Activists

We are currently developing a platform to link the talents of those that would like to get involved with the appropriate avenue for them to get involved.
When funded, we will begin platform design and will develop the mechanism to match skills/talents to need as the work continues. 
Goal 3: Link Strategies to Target Systemic and Structural Reform at All Levels

We are currently developing an interactive platform to capture the policy recommendations and demands targeting systemic and structural reform highlighted by the events in Ferguson.
When funded, we will create a platform to host the policy demands that have arisen and to link to resources and ways for allies to get involved.
Everyone Has a Role To Play
There is a broad-based team of activists supporting this work and a host of tech advisors providing technical assistance. We're excited about what's possible.For those that have asked, here is my bio:A native of Baltimore, DeRay McKesson is a graduate of Bowdoin College and began his career as a 6th grade math teacher in New York City as a member of the 2007 Teach For America corps. As a teenager, he worked as a community organizer, training youth and adults to work together to overcome community challenges with Baltimore’s Safe and Sound Campaign.

<li>Samatha Tomlin is the Ambassador for the Hard Rock Hell festival, and Wendy Page is a gig photographer working in and around Berkshire for many years.<br/>
</li>
<li>We want to raise money for The Sophie Lancaster Foundation by publishing a calendar of emerging rock and heavy metal musicians. <br/>
</li> <li>The work of the Foundation focuses on creating respect for and understanding of subcultures in our communities. As part of the rock subculture, we feel this is important work, especially for the younger members of the metal and goth communities as they need to feel safe and protected in order to properly express themselves. <br/><p><br/></p>
</li>
</ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul>
<li> It should be ok to be different, not an invitation to violence and abuse. We are hoping to raise as much money as possible to help the Sophie Lancaster Foundation in their work reaching out to Stamp Out Prejudice Hatred and Intolerance Everywhere.<br/>
</li> <li>We are offering a unique collection of photographs in a calendar you will want to keep - especially if you buy the signed one (or collect the signatures as you see the bands live!)<br/>
</li> <li>If we don't reach our goal, then you lose nothing - the money stays in your bank. Hopefully, though, you will support us and we will have a nice chunk of cash to hand over!<br/>
</li> </ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3> <ul>
<li>You will have a copy of a unique calendar showcasing a range of musicians, and you can feel good about having them on your wall knowing your cash has helped a very important cause!<br/>
</li>
<li>This is our first venture of this kind, but if this year is a success, who knows, it could become a yearly project!<br/>
</li>
<li>Our volunteer models have very bravely come forward to pose for us probably in ways they never have before! We are aiming to make them all look sexy, and hopefully you will also check out their music - there are CDs on offer in some of the incentive packages!<br/>
</li> </ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> This is going to be a real challenge for us, scheduling shoots over the next couple of months around the touring bands, and finding locations near them if they cannot travel to us.</p> <ul>

Samatha Tomlin is the Ambassador for the Hard Rock Hell festival, and Wendy Page is a gig photographer working in and around Berkshire for many years.

We want to raise money for The Sophie Lancaster Foundation by publishing a calendar of emerging rock and heavy metal musicians. 
 The work of the Foundation focuses on creating respect for and understanding of subcultures in our communities. As part of the rock subculture, we feel this is important work, especially for the younger members of the metal and goth communities as they need to feel safe and protected in order to properly express themselves. 

  What We Need & What You Get 
 It should be ok to be different, not an invitation to violence and abuse. We are hoping to raise as much money as possible to help the Sophie Lancaster Foundation in their work reaching out to Stamp Out Prejudice Hatred and Intolerance Everywhere.
 We are offering a unique collection of photographs in a calendar you will want to keep - especially if you buy the signed one (or collect the signatures as you see the bands live!)
 If we don't reach our goal, then you lose nothing - the money stays in your bank. Hopefully, though, you will support us and we will have a nice chunk of cash to hand over!
   The Impact 
You will have a copy of a unique calendar showcasing a range of musicians, and you can feel good about having them on your wall knowing your cash has helped a very important cause!

This is our first venture of this kind, but if this year is a success, who knows, it could become a yearly project!

Our volunteer models have very bravely come forward to pose for us probably in ways they never have before! We are aiming to make them all look sexy, and hopefully you will also check out their music - there are CDs on offer in some of the incentive packages!
   Risks & Challenges  This is going to be a real challenge for us, scheduling shoots over the next couple of months around the touring bands, and finding locations near them if they cannot travel to us. 
Samantha will be dealing with the diary as well as helping on the shoots, and this should be hectic! Every band has gigs and festivals across the summer, and we need to complete all the pictures before the printing deadline. There should probably be a blog...
 Wendy will be expanding her skills as we go, learning about new equipment and thinking up scenarios on the fly as well as shooting planned photosets. Imagination is key, and spotting the locations to bring out the character of each model. Expect the unexpected!

Highlights of our performances are:  opening for Paco de Lucia at Massey Hall and performing for the Prime Minister of Malta at the Malta International Arts Festival and performing for Sting and Russel Crowe.  My experiences have been amazing, as my entire life has revolved around dance, flamenco and performing.   My flamenco dance career has taken me to Mexico, California, Malta and now - to Spain itself!  In 2012 I won the prestigious Paula Citron Fresh Blood Award for outstanding emerging Canadian choreographer.  Paula Citron wrote an amazing review about my dancing that has encouraged me to take risks with my own choreography and develop myself further as a artist.  </p><p>""Scannura is developing her own hybrid and she is truly a representative of Canadian dance in that respect.  Her dancing and choreography expresses a country of immigrants where many styles collide together to take dance into New World territory"".</p><p> -Paula Citron for the Globe and Mail, Toronto</p><p>   I have received the Chalmers Professional Development Grant to pursue studies in flamenco and have also received grants from the Ontario Arts Council and the Toronto Arts Council to present my first full-length performance titled Danzas Sagradas that was just premiered to full houses and standing ovations at Harbourfront Centre's NextSteps Dance Festival.  </p><p>     As someone that is not from Spain, I have always had a dream to be recognized internationally as a flamenco dancer, which is a rare feat.  A few years ago I had the opportunity to attend the Certamen Coreografia de Danza Espanola y Flamenco  in Madrid and watched the best young up and coming dancers in flamenco present works on a theatrical stage in front of Spain's most acclaimed artists.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are The Friction, an independent multidisciplinary queer arts collective comprised of eight young and enthusiastic artists. We've been around for nearly a year and in that time, we've brought a lot of quality, innovative programming to the Minneapolis arts community and provided a financially accessible alternative space for outside organizations to host events and productions. We are especially committed to creating equal visibility and support for queer artists.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's the Money For?</h3>
<p>We rent our space for a very low rate, but none of us are financially solvent enough to contribute out of pocket. As of right now, we have no fiscal sponsorship and have to fight each month to stay afloat on last-minute fundraisers and the nominal fee we charge outside groups to use our space. 100% of funds raised in this campaign will be put toward our rent ($500/month), in conjunction with funds from the aforementioned sources, so that we may continue to use the space through the end of the summer (and beyond, as during this time we hope to raise more money) If we do not meet our goal, we will throw a party to raise money. If we do meet our goal, we will throw a party to celebrate.</p>
<h3>What's the Space For?</h3>
<p>We, as The Friction Collective, exist independently of our space, but it is far and away the greatest resource we have. Our passion and vigor can only get us so far. We meet in the building twice a week to plan programming and put together our show The Firgun, Fraught <a href=""http://www.patrickscabaret.org/cal/event.php?calendar=1&amp;category=&amp;event=9830&amp;date=2013-05-18"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(May 17-18 at Patrick's Cabaret)</a>, and <em>someone</em> is rehearsing there almost daily.  Not only do we benefit from having such a large, reasonably-priced space, but members of our artistic community do as well, and we have offered up this resource of ours to great effect.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Papergirl is a project originating in Berlin in 2006. Since then, it has travelled globally, with a number of cities around the world adopting the concept. Basically, a call out to artists is made to contribute artwork for display and distribution often in multiple print format. The work is displayed in a gallery setting before being given out to an unsuspecting public<br/><br/>The purpose is to feel part of an altruistic, playful and creative project... to gather people in spaces to drink, laugh and to adventure together. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact is to add to a rapidly decreasing programme of arts festivals and events across the city of Newcastle and surrounding areas. Also to offer events and happenings that are more for participation than observation... get everyone together and just makes some stories.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have already had phase 1 of the project... the preview night at Settle Down Cafe. This event, and all others have been completely unfunded and independant. A couple of us have so far paid for everything on our very meagre incomes, including booze, sweets, promo and what seems like endless amounts for time! <br/><br/>Phase 2 is rapidly approaching. The distribution! This is going to be pretty exciting! And we have big plans... but we need some help paying for it. Settle Down Cafe has kindly offered to cook breakfast for all volunteer cyclists... and with the preview night as a guide... that might get a bit silly and we can't expect a kind, independant small business to foot the cost of that! We also need to by loads of materials for decorating bikes and venues! For pre and post distribution parties! And for the latter... if you want booze! You'll have to help us out! The last lot cleaned us out!<br/><br/>Any help you can offer would be really appreciated! This has already been a great adventure and we want to give it our all right til the end! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you have access to big sheets of coloured paper, bicycle assessories... alcohol company sponsorships, own a butchers or bakers who can hook us up! P.A hire? As the addage goes... every little helps!<br/></p>

<h3><b>Announcing the Sulfur Studios Expansion!</b></h3>
<p>February 2016 marks the one-year anniversary of Sulfur
Studios!  In that time we have provided
affordable workspace to 21 artists and organizations and put on 24 solo and group
exhibitions featuring local and national artists.  As a completely volunteer-run organization we have presented over a dozen music shows and
hosted a variety of community events, including open studio nights, workshops,
film screenings and more. None of this would have been possible without the support of our community, and once again we are asking for your help to continue to expand our offerings for the creative community.</p>
<p></p>

<p><br/></p>
<h2>The Space</h2>
<p>In early 2016 Sulfur Studios will be expanding into the
upstairs of our current building at 2301 Bull Street.  We will
provide an additional 8 studios, a shared workspace, and a dedicated event
space, allowing us to expand our contributions to Savannah’s creative community.</p>
<p></p>

exhibitions, but can happen simultaneously. <p></p>

<p>The additional studio space will also allow us to offer a
studio residency program, which will bring creative professionals from out of town
in order to share their talents and experiences with our community. The residency will increase the national profile of the arts in Savannah and the Starland District.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are looking to raise $12,000 in order to renovate the upstairs and develop new programs for the space:  </p>
<p>We will be working with Sam Carroll Construction to build 8 new affordable studios, which is a lot of studs, drywall, and paint! The studios will range from 80 - 150 sqft, with 10 foot ceilings. Several have windows on the outside walls, and almost all have natural light.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will be furnishing a shared work space with worktables and stools so we can provide a collaborative environment for the creative community.  We will also continue to improve the public spaces of the ground floor, with new flooring and restroom upgrades.</p>
<p>Finally, part of the funds raised will help cover the costs of providing a free studio and exhibition opportunities for our Artist-in-Residence series starting in Summer/Fall of 2016.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We have been blown away by the wonderful response to the programs at Sulfur Studios in the past year.  Our Studios are full and we have a waiting list of artists who still need affordable workspace.  Our gallery has been used for so much more than just exhibitions - it has been transformed into a music venue, a movie theater and a classroom as needed.  By expanding Sulfur Studios into the upstairs of our building, we will be able to provide even more artists with affordable workspace, and schedule more community events without conflicts with exhibitions in the gallery.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This is a big step for a young organization, but we feel that Sulfur Studios' track record over the past year has shown that we can take on big projects and make them happen.  </p>
<p>The building that houses Sulfur Studios is old and a bit temperamental, so there is always the chance we will incur unexpected costs during the renovation, but we are confident that we can find creative solutions to any problems that may arise.</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A quarter of a century ago, Nikola-Lenivets was founded as a settlement by artists, architects and designers who left cities for the sake of practicing the arts in the wild. Nowadays it is the biggest art and landscape park in Europe which occupies more than 600 hectares of land. Dozens of giant installations are situated here, although some of them were burned down during the traditional Slavic holiday, Maslenitsa aka Butter Week. It is symbolic that Makhalych (from Russian word «makhat’» — «to wave» or «to flap») will be built here for the Burning Man Festival.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460991714/maslenitsa_e4i7tb.png"" src="""" style=""width: 649.3643410852713px;height: 283px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The kinetic sculpture Makhalych, which will be featured at the Burning Man 2016, is yet another incarnation of a russian architect and the founder of Nikola-Lenivets Vasily Schetinin’s character «Icarushka» (a Russian intimate hypocorism for Icarus).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">History of Makhalych</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The first prototype was made in the late 1980s. Schetinin managed to exhibit it abroad due to the fact that he was a member of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitki"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soviet underground art group «Mit’ki»</a>. In those years,that was a true miracle. The second version of Icarushka became a symbol of «Peace Caravan», a festival of street theater arranged by <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/08/theater/reviews/08slav.html?_r=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Slava Polunin</a>, and it was featured at exhibitions of several art and architecture museums.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460968430/2_%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%83%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD_ispkby.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 582.3364485981309px;height: 402px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Unlike Icarus, Makhalych: the Birding Man is a forty-yard giant who is not trying to get away to the sky. Pure movement is his final goal. This kinetic interactive object will be presented in the Black Rock Desert from 28 August to 5 September, 2016, Art Theme: Da Vinci's Workshop.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Makhalych refers to a variety of archetypal images: primarily birdlike flying machines by Leonardo da Vinci and <a href=""https://utopiadystopiawwi.wordpress.com/constructivism/vladimir-tatlin/letalin/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soviet avant-garde architect Vladimir Tatlin</a>. A human figure, equipped with wings, is always the symbol which stands to counter injustice, transcend borders and celebrate human thought.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Specifications</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The scale of Makhalych is due to the fact that the natural landscape serves as the exhibition space. The self-balancing kinetic interactive design consists of six eighteen-yard wooden wings,a sixteen-foot-long figure and a multimedia system for audio and visual effects. The weight of various parts of the sculpture is balanced in such a way that the efforts of one person suffice to bring it into motion.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The figure is made up of wooden hollow rings connected by metal bridges. Its weight is about three hundred kilograms. The six wings add almost two more tons. In the event of windstorms, the whole sculpture can be lowered to the ground in a few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460968317/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80_iqyt4x.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 590.3274559193954px;height: 378px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Despite the team’s extensive experience in the creation of huge wooden installations and kinetic sculptures, this project is experimental, so some of the final design decisions may be made exclusively and directly during the manufacture and test assembling stages.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p>
<p>
</p> <h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Stages of the project</span></h3>
<p><b>Stage 1</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">: the development of </span><b>ideas and sketches</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">. This process has actually spanned over a quarter of a century. </span><b>Stage 2</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">: the creation of </span><b>the model</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> of Makhalych in the ratio of 1 to 20. This has already been completed. The model (as featured in the video above) reflects precisely all the design parameters. </span><b>Stage 3</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> recently commenced in a hangar located near Schetinin’s studio. The aim of this stage is to construct a </span><b>full-sized wing</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">. </span><b>Stage 4</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> involves the </span><b>production of all the six wings</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> and hanging them to test for susceptibility to wind loads. </span><b>Stage 5</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> begins simultaneously: the design of </span><b>the figure</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> which will form the basis of the sculpture. The final stages will take place from mid-May to late June, after which Makhalych will depart from Nikola-Lenivets through St. Petersburg and the Atlantic Ocean to the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, USA.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Estimated budjet</span></h3>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><p>This year the organizing committee of the Burning Man Festival made dream come true by providing a honorarium grant for the construction of Makhalych in the desert of Nevada, but in the end these funds can cover only a small part of the costs. We will still need to be supplied with numerous power tools, workshops space, transport to the Playa, and much more. Our expenses are even higher yet as we are coming to Black Rock from the middle of Russia.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460983899/budjet_breakdown_vmiez6.png"" src="""" style=""width: 566.0286738351255px;height: 281px;""/></p>
<p>The total budget for this piece is $97,000 which includes workshop rental and woodworking machine, salaries, materials, feasibility study, testing, shipping, transportation and installation of the artwork. Simultaneously to the crowd funding we are raising some private donations. We also will add some stretch goals as we approach the initial goal.</p></span></div>

<h3>Человек всегда мечтал обрести возможность летать. Благодаря вашей помощи в этом году в пустыне Блэк Рок взлетит «Махалыч: Birding man».</h3>
<br/><p>Четверть века назад в самом сердце России началась жизнь арт-парка Никола-Ленивец. За эти годы на его территории известные архитекторы из разных стран возвели десятки гигантских художественных инсталляций. Часть из них сжигалась во время Масленицы, что символически роднит Никола-Ленивец с фестивалем Burning Man. Этой весной именно здесь будет создана сорокаметровая кинетическая скульптура «Махалыч: Birding man».</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460991714/maslenitsa_e4i7tb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Кинетический объект «Махалыч» для The Burning Man 2016 – очередное перерождение художественного персонажа архитектора Василия Щетинина «Икарушка», история которого началась в 1989 году.</p>
<br/><h3>История</h3>
<p>Первый «Икарушка» был сделан в 1989 году из завалившегося забора. Ему, как и его мифологическому прототипу, удалось почти невозможное: выпорхнуть за границу, на выставку «Митьков» в Антверпен. Второй «Икарушка», наряженный в одежду художника, с гордо распростёртыми двенадцатиметровыми крыльями, стал символом фестиваля уличных театров «Караван мира», организованного Славой Полуниным. Истории взлётов и падений «Икарушки» была посвящена выставка, прошедшая в 2002 году в Государственном Музее Архитектуры им. Щусева.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460968430/2_%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%83%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD_ispkby.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Birding Man — уже не совсем «Икарушка». Этот сорокаметровый исполин не пытается взлететь; его крылья, чутко реагирующие на любые воздействия движутся, собственно, ради движения и одновременно создают своего рода укрытие, сень.</p>
<p>Кинетическая скульптура будет представлена в пустыне Блэк-Рок с 28 августа по 5 сентября. Тема фестиваля в этом году – наследие итальянского ренессанса.</p>
<p>«Махалыч» отсылает к целому ряду архетипических образов: птицеподобные летательные аппараты да Винчи, порождённый русским авангардом Летатлин. Во все времена фигура человека, приделавшего себе крылья, выступала символом противодействия несправедливости, преодоления границ возможного и торжества человеческой мысли.</p>
<br/><h3>Технические характеристики</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Масштаб «Махалыча» исходит из того, что сама природа является для него экспозиционным пространством. Самоуравновешенная кинетическая интерактивная конструкция, дополненная светозвуковой инсталляцией, состоит из пятиметровой фигуры и трех пар крыльев, размах которых – тридцать шесть метров. </p>
<p>Работая с распределением массы разных частей «Махалыча» команде удалось добиться такого уровня балансировки, что привести в движение всю конструкцию можно будет усилиями одного человека.</p>
<p></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460968317/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80_iqyt4x.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</div>
<div>Человеческую фигуру архитектор собирается представить в виде ажурной конструкции, составленной из полых колец, соединенных металлическими перемычками. Её вес – около трехсот килограмм. Еще почти две тонны весят шесть крыльев. В случае возникновения ураганных ветров, иногда случающихся в пустыне, вся скульптура может за несколько минут быть опущена на землю.</div>
<div>
<p>Несмотря на большой опыт создания многометровых инсталляций из дерева и кинетических скульптур, имеющийся у команды, проект является экспериментальным, поэтому некоторые конструктивные решения могут быть приняты исключительно и непосредственно в процессе изготовления или тестирования в условиях пробного монтажа.</p>
<br/><h3>Этапы работы</h3>
<p><b>I этап</b> <b>— разработка идеи</b> и эскизов проекта. Этот процесс фактически растянулся на четверть века. <b>II этап</b> также пройден<b> — создание модели</b> «Махалыча» в масштабе 1:20, отражающей все параметры конструкции, от соотношения массы и размеров до угла наклона каждой пары крыльев. Точная копия движущегося «Махалыч» и запечатлена на видео. <b>III этап</b> <b>— создание полноразмерного крыла</b>, над которым уже начата работа в ангаре, расположенном неподалёку от мастерской Василия Щетинина. <b>IV этап — производство шести крыльев и вывешивание их на строительный кран</b> для испытания восприимчивости к ветряным нагрузкам. Параллельно с этим начинается <b>V этап — конструирование фигуры человека</b>, которая и составит основу композиции. Заключительные этапы будут происходить с середины мая до конца июня, после чего «Махалыч» отправится на пароме из Санкт-Петербурга через Атлантический океан в пустыню Блэк Рок штата Невада, США.</p>
<br/><h3>Команда</h3>

</div>
<p>Костяк команды Василия Щетинина это Владимир, единолично продумавший конструктивное устройство таких сложнейших объектов из дерева, как <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/101500095@N07/albums/72157635562294646/with/15090287678/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Бобур</a> и

Коллектив <a href=""http://soundscape.site"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">проекта Soundscape</a>, ответственный за создание многоканальных инсталляций в лесах вокруг парка Никола-Ленивец, оживит скульптуру светозвуковым наполнением.</p>
<br/><h3>Бюджет</h3>
<p>В этом году оргкомитет фестиваля Burning Man приблизил возможность строительства масштабной скульптуры, предоставив грант. Но эти средства смогут покрыть лишь часть расходов. Для производства «Махалыча» необходимо арендовать ангар и оборудование, организовать транспортировку из Калужской области до Невады, и многое другое. Наши расходы еще выше, чем у других подобных проектов, так как нам предстоит перевести гигантский арт-объект через атлантический океан.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460983899/budjet_breakdown_vmiez6.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
</div>

A quarter of a century ago, Nikola-Lenivets was founded as a settlement by artists, architects and designers who left cities for the sake of practicing the arts in the wild. Nowadays it is the biggest art and landscape park in Europe which occupies more than 600 hectares of land. Dozens of giant installations are situated here, although some of them were burned down during the traditional Slavic holiday, Maslenitsa aka Butter Week. It is symbolic that Makhalych (from Russian word «makhat’» — «to wave» or «to flap») will be built here for the Burning Man Festival.





The kinetic sculpture Makhalych, which will be featured at the Burning Man 2016, is yet another incarnation of a russian architect and the founder of Nikola-Lenivets Vasily Schetinin’s character «Icarushka» (a Russian intimate hypocorism for Icarus).



History of Makhalych
The first prototype was made in the late 1980s. Schetinin managed to exhibit it abroad due to the fact that he was a member of the Soviet underground art group «Mit’ki». In those years,that was a true miracle. The second version of Icarushka became a symbol of «Peace Caravan», a festival of street theater arranged by Slava Polunin, and it was featured at exhibitions of several art and architecture museums.





Unlike Icarus, Makhalych: the Birding Man is a forty-yard giant who is not trying to get away to the sky. Pure movement is his final goal. This kinetic interactive object will be presented in the Black Rock Desert from 28 August to 5 September, 2016, Art Theme: Da Vinci's Workshop.


Makhalych refers to a variety of archetypal images: primarily birdlike flying machines by Leonardo da Vinci and Soviet avant-garde architect Vladimir Tatlin. A human figure, equipped with wings, is always the symbol which stands to counter injustice, transcend borders and celebrate human thought.



Specifications
The scale of Makhalych is due to the fact that the natural landscape serves as the exhibition space. The self-balancing kinetic interactive design consists of six eighteen-yard wooden wings,a sixteen-foot-long figure and a multimedia system for audio and visual effects. The weight of various parts of the sculpture is balanced in such a way that the efforts of one person suffice to bring it into motion.


The figure is made up of wooden hollow rings connected by metal bridges. Its weight is about three hundred kilograms. The six wings add almost two more tons. In the event of windstorms, the whole sculpture can be lowered to the ground in a few minutes.





Despite the team’s extensive experience in the creation of huge wooden installations and kinetic sculptures, this project is experimental, so some of the final design decisions may be made exclusively and directly during the manufacture and test assembling stages.


 Stages of the project
Stage 1: the development of ideas and sketches. This process has actually spanned over a quarter of a century. Stage 2: the creation of the model of Makhalych in the ratio of 1 to 20. This has already been completed. The model (as featured in the video above) reflects precisely all the design parameters. Stage 3 recently commenced in a hangar located near Schetinin’s studio. The aim of this stage is to construct a full-sized wing. Stage 4 involves the production of all the six wings and hanging them to test for susceptibility to wind loads. Stage 5 begins simultaneously: the design of the figure which will form the basis of the sculpture. The final stages will take place from mid-May to late June, after which Makhalych will depart from Nikola-Lenivets through St. Petersburg and the Atlantic Ocean to the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, USA.

 The Team

The core of Schetinin’s team consists of Vladimir, who developed the construction of such complex wooden art-objects as the Bobur and
the Universal Mind (you should definitely take a look at it!), and Denis (on the left), who assembled by hand dozens of different sized models of Makhalych. The soundscape project, which is responsible for the creation of multi-channel audio installations in the forests of the Nikola-Lenivets park, will liven up the sculpture with light and sound effects.

Estimated budjet
This year the organizing committee of the Burning Man Festival made dream come true by providing a honorarium grant for the construction of Makhalych in the desert of Nevada, but in the end these funds can cover only a small part of the costs. We will still need to be supplied with numerous power tools, workshops space, transport to the Playa, and much more. Our expenses are even higher yet as we are coming to Black Rock from the middle of Russia.


The total budget for this piece is $97,000 which includes workshop rental and woodworking machine, salaries, materials, feasibility study, testing, shipping, transportation and installation of the artwork. Simultaneously to the crowd funding we are raising some private donations. We also will add some stretch goals as we approach the initial goal.

As you can see we need your support either way. If you can't help financially you always can aid Makhalych to spread the world by sharing info about this project in your social networks. Don't forget to use #makhalych hashtag!

Otherwise you can get one of our super cool perks (and be sure to look forward for the secret ones)!

Русская версия

Человек всегда мечтал обрести возможность летать. Благодаря вашей помощи в этом году в пустыне Блэк Рок взлетит «Махалыч: Birding man».
Четверть века назад в самом сердце России началась жизнь арт-парка Никола-Ленивец. За эти годы на его территории известные архитекторы из разных стран возвели десятки гигантских художественных инсталляций. Часть из них сжигалась во время Масленицы, что символически роднит Никола-Ленивец с фестивалем Burning Man. Этой весной именно здесь будет создана сорокаметровая кинетическая скульптура «Махалыч: Birding man».

Кинетический объект «Махалыч» для The Burning Man 2016 – очередное перерождение художественного персонажа архитектора Василия Щетинина «Икарушка», история которого началась в 1989 году.
История
Первый «Икарушка» был сделан в 1989 году из завалившегося забора. Ему, как и его мифологическому прототипу, удалось почти невозможное: выпорхнуть за границу, на выставку «Митьков» в Антверпен. Второй «Икарушка», наряженный в одежду художника, с гордо распростёртыми двенадцатиметровыми крыльями, стал символом фестиваля уличных театров «Караван мира», организованного Славой Полуниным. Истории взлётов и падений «Икарушки» была посвящена выставка, прошедшая в 2002 году в Государственном Музее Архитектуры им. Щусева.

Birding Man — уже не совсем «Икарушка». Этот сорокаметровый исполин не пытается взлететь; его крылья, чутко реагирующие на любые воздействия движутся, собственно, ради движения и одновременно создают своего рода укрытие, сень.
Кинетическая скульптура будет представлена в пустыне Блэк-Рок с 28 августа по 5 сентября. Тема фестиваля в этом году – наследие итальянского ренессанса.
«Махалыч» отсылает к целому ряду архетипических образов: птицеподобные летательные аппараты да Винчи, порождённый русским авангардом Летатлин. Во все времена фигура человека, приделавшего себе крылья, выступала символом противодействия несправедливости, преодоления границ возможного и торжества человеческой мысли.
Технические характеристики

Масштаб «Махалыча» исходит из того, что сама природа является для него экспозиционным пространством. Самоуравновешенная кинетическая интерактивная конструкция, дополненная светозвуковой инсталляцией, состоит из пятиметровой фигуры и трех пар крыльев, размах которых – тридцать шесть метров. 
Работая с распределением массы разных частей «Махалыча» команде удалось добиться такого уровня балансировки, что привести в движение всю конструкцию можно будет усилиями одного человека.



Человеческую фигуру архитектор собирается представить в виде ажурной конструкции, составленной из полых колец, соединенных металлическими перемычками. Её вес – около трехсот килограмм. Еще почти две тонны весят шесть крыльев. В случае возникновения ураганных ветров, иногда случающихся в пустыне, вся скульптура может за несколько минут быть опущена на землю.

Несмотря на большой опыт создания многометровых инсталляций из дерева и кинетических скульптур, имеющийся у команды, проект является экспериментальным, поэтому некоторые конструктивные решения могут быть приняты исключительно и непосредственно в процессе изготовления или тестирования в условиях пробного монтажа.
Этапы работы
I этап — разработка идеи и эскизов проекта. Этот процесс фактически растянулся на четверть века. II этап также пройден — создание модели «Махалыча» в масштабе 1:20, отражающей все параметры конструкции, от соотношения массы и размеров до угла наклона каждой пары крыльев. Точная копия движущегося «Махалыч» и запечатлена на видео. III этап — создание полноразмерного крыла, над которым уже начата работа в ангаре, расположенном неподалёку от мастерской Василия Щетинина. IV этап — производство шести крыльев и вывешивание их на строительный кран для испытания восприимчивости к ветряным нагрузкам. Параллельно с этим начинается V этап — конструирование фигуры человека, которая и составит основу композиции. Заключительные этапы будут происходить с середины мая до конца июня, после чего «Махалыч» отправится на пароме из Санкт-Петербурга через Атлантический океан в пустыню Блэк Рок штата Невада, США.
Команда



Костяк команды Василия Щетинина это Владимир, единолично продумавший конструктивное устройство таких сложнейших объектов из дерева, как Бобур и
Вселенский разум (это стоит увидеть!), и Денис, чьими руками собраны десятки макетов Махалыча разных размеров. Коллектив проекта Soundscape, ответственный за создание многоканальных инсталляций в лесах вокруг парка Никола-Ленивец, оживит скульптуру светозвуковым наполнением.
Бюджет
В этом году оргкомитет фестиваля Burning Man приблизил возможность строительства масштабной скульптуры, предоставив грант. Но эти средства смогут покрыть лишь часть расходов. Для производства «Махалыча» необходимо арендовать ангар и оборудование, организовать транспортировку из Калужской области до Невады, и многое другое. Наши расходы еще выше, чем у других подобных проектов, так как нам предстоит перевести гигантский арт-объект через атлантический океан.


Общий бюджет составляет $97 000, и включает в себя аренду производства и станков, зарплаты рабочим, стоимость материалов и их доставку, проведение работ для расчета нагрузок, тестирование, транспортировку и оснащение скульптуры звуковым и световым наполнением. Одновременно с краудфандингом мы ищем средства и от частных спонсоров. Если нам удастся собрать заявленные $15 000 в опережающие наш оптимизм сроки, то мы не остановимся и будем добавлять новые лоты для продолжения кампании.

<p><strong>Those memories are meshed</strong> with both the experiences I had in my many <strong>travels to Spain</strong> to connect with my father’s ancestral roots and also with <strong>my experience in the United States</strong> where I have lived for almost fifteen years and where I continue to develop an artistic vision formed by my multi-cultural experiences.    </p>

<p><strong>Esos recuerdos se entremezclan</strong> con las vivencias obtenidas durante mis frecuentes <strong>viajes a España</strong> para conectarme con mis raíces ancestrales paternas, así como también con la <strong>experiencia en los Estados Unidos</strong>, donde he vivido por casi quince años y donde he seguido desarrollando una visión artística surgida desde mis <strong>vivencias multiculturales</strong>. </p>

Experience and share Chilean classical music trough abstract art with original paintings, prints and greeting cards.
About this project 


Hi, my name is Jacqueline Unanue, I am a Chilean-Spanish-American visual artist living in Philadelphia PA, USA.
My traveling exhibition will span 3 countries. My Ancient Land series is inspired by the music of Chilean Classical Composers and my multicultural memories.

Perks Summary More about them below

Exhibition Main Pieces

The Exhibition is composed of 24 pieces, 7 of them are really big (see below).
Exhibition The Artwork

Here are all the pieces of it.
See more here.
Inspiration Chilean Classic Composers


Immersed in this music as I painted, l felt it flow through me physically and found myself expressing both the movement of the music and my own emotions in free and spontaneous brush strokes that are musical as well as gestural.
I’ve been influenced by renowned Chilean classical composers. Among others:


 René Amengual



 Jorge Urrutia



 Eulogio Dávalos 



 Juan Orrego-Salas



 Enrique Soro



 Sylvia Soublette 


Inspiration My homeland Chile, Spain, United States

Chile, the country where I was born and where I developed my artistic career, is firmly recorded in my memory.  The colors I have used suggest -in an abstract way-, my memories of the geography, the forest, the desert, the ocean, and the Chilean sky.
Those memories are meshed with both the experiences I had in my many travels to Spain to connect with my father’s ancestral roots and also with my experience in the United States where I have lived for almost fifteen years and where I continue to develop an artistic vision formed by my multi-cultural experiences.    
Perks Share a multicultural experience!

All perks include my eternal thanks, an invitation to the 3 exhibitions. Also, your name will be pointed out in the names wall list in each gallery.

Inspiración Compositores Clásicos Chilenos


Inmersa en estas obras musicales, mientras pintaba, sentí fluir la música físicamente hacia mí y me enontré expresándome a través de sus movimientos y de mis propias emociones, mediante trazos libres y espontáneos, generando pinturas musicales y gestuales. 
He sido influenciada por renombrados compositores clásicos chilenos. Entre ellos: 


 René Amengual



 Jorge Urrutia Blondel



 Eulogio Dávalos 



 Juan Orrego-Salas



 Enrique Soro



 Sylvia Soublette 


Inspiración Mi país Chile, España y Estados Unidos

Chile, el país donde nací y donde me desarrollé artísticamente, está firmemente grabado en mi memoria.Los colores que he usado, sugieren -en un modo abstracto-, mis recuerdos de la geografía, de la vegetación, del desierto, del océano, y del firmamento chilenos.
Esos recuerdos se entremezclan con las vivencias obtenidas durante mis frecuentes viajes a España para conectarme con mis raíces ancestrales paternas, así como también con la experiencia en los Estados Unidos, donde he vivido por casi quince años y donde he seguido desarrollando una visión artística surgida desde mis vivencias multiculturales.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">ABOUT OLLIE</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Oliver, or Ollie for short! I'm a Chinese-American, queer, nonbinary-trans person living in Portland, OR. I use they/he pronouns. For about two years I have been the evil mastermind behind hournoon - a mixed-media illustration, crafts, + apparel design project. Visual art has been an integral aspect to me since I was very young. I have dedicated two decades to getting lost in color and pursuing many mediums of art, including illustration, resin casting, fiber arts,  and music. </p>
<p>I hope to bring safer spaces, body loving acceptance and accommodation to my tattooing. I struggle with disassociation and dysphoria in my daily life, and I have found solace in being able to look to the ink in my skin as another reminder that I'm here, living, and three-dimensional. This grounding experience is sincerely important to me, and I want to use my years of practice as an illustrator to aid anyone else struggling with similar feelings through tattoo work. I'd also just love to tattoo people who enjoy my art - a big thank you to those of you who do!</p>
<p>This can be possible with your help! Help me complete my tuition for tattoo school!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">SCHOOL?</h3>
<p>Completing a program authorized by the Oregon Board of Body Art Practitioners is required in this state to obtain a tattooing license. I've been accepted into the March term at Point of View tattoo school. You can read more about Point of View's tattoo school here: <a href=""https://www.pointofviewtattooschool.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.pointofviewtattooschool.com/</a></p>
<p>I have personally saved 70% of the tuition ($7000/$10000) working full time as a manager at my day job, and through hournoon. Scholarships and grants for trade schools like tattooing are tough, if not impossible, to obtain. Due to this, I am reaching out to my friends, family, peers and community to help bring me across this last leg of my tuition. If exceeded, anything received over my goal will continue to go towards my tattooing career: obtaining a machine, supplies, studio space, etc. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">PERKS</h3>
<p>Your support means so much, so I want to give back with perks! </p>
<p>For every $5 donation, you'll receive one starry wolf sticker, exclusive to this fundraiser! Starry wolf will be printed on mirror vinyl, locally in Portland by <a href=""https://sticker-ninja.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stickerninja</a>.</p>

<p></p>The Good Women Cooperative is comprised of 40 female artisanal leaders striving for economic independence and stability for Amazigh women and culture in Ayt Hassan, Morocco. I, CorpsAfrica Volunteer Elghali Guennouni, am producing this campaign to assist the Good Women Cooperative in raising funds for the materials, training, and marketplace access necessary to make their cooperative sustainable and financially viable. This will allow these women and their families much needed regular non-agriculture based income.<br/>
</div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The vision of the Good Women Cooperative is to preserve and improve upon the unique and original Amazigh craft techniques and patterns currently being used by the artisans, while at the same time adapting these skills for more modern product lines. </p>

The Good Women Cooperative is comprised of 40 female artisanal leaders striving for economic independence and stability for Amazigh women and culture in Ayt Hassan, Morocco. I, CorpsAfrica Volunteer Elghali Guennouni, am producing this campaign to assist the Good Women Cooperative in raising funds for the materials, training, and marketplace access necessary to make their cooperative sustainable and financially viable. This will allow these women and their families much needed regular non-agriculture based income.
  What We Need & What You Get

The vision of the Good Women Cooperative is to preserve and improve upon the unique and original Amazigh craft techniques and patterns currently being used by the artisans, while at the same time adapting these skills for more modern product lines.

                                       Clove neckless

This means the continued and improved production of Amazigh necklaces, rugs, and other traditional products, while at the same time adapting these designs for the production of shirts, pants, wallet, baskets, caps, pillow cases, etc. To do this the cooperative will need 2 sewing machines, a serger, and an embroidery machine plus supplies to begin product production. They are also going to invite a group of successful women artisans from Fez, the artisanal capital of Morocco, to do a 10 day workshop with them. This workshop will cover modernized textile techniques and lessons on running a sustainable and economically viable women owned cooperative in Morocco.

 Lastly, the women will need a higher end camera and computer.  This will allow them access to the international market and other entrepreneurs, which is vital to their success due to the saturation of the standard Moroccan marketplaces with “traditional goods.”  These items will also help them bypass the pitfalls of the male dominated traditional Moroccan business world.  The women of this village had, at one time, worked to produce handicrafts for a private business, but were discouraged by their lack of commercial gain.  They separated themselves from that venture, that is how they develop themselves into an independent, cooperative group.

Burning Man 2015
<p>― Hakim Bey, The Temporary Autonomous Zone</p>
<p>     You walk through the dust and heat of day, beyond the heart of the city, and from the haze before you emerges a shape that is both plant and place, flower and temple, both open and contained. No fence keeps you out, but one hundred and eight lanterns mark out the space, like a fairy ring in the forest, like the hundred and eight beads of the Buddhist rosary. </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>     Through the archway you walk. Up the long, low steps, the muffled sound of your tread meets the familiar clunk of wood; the music of a seaside pier rises from the dust, invoking the sense of some long lost place where water once stretched out to kiss the horizon. Below, the improbable sounds of water and the briefest hints of ocean blue tickle the imagination. From above, eight dragons of fire and steel peer down, watching you, or look out into the distance, waiting.</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>     And again, the thing that is neither quite plant nor place seems to hover at the edge of defining, the green rooftop like a lily pad, the great lotus rising up out of the dried mud and the memory of water, each petal big enough to sleep in, open out from this improbable tree, this pillar of memories.</p>
<p>     </p>
<p>     Inside, past and present blend and dance together. Old rites and new technologies bring fresh form to venerable, ancient practices. There is hidden circuitry here: casting the moon blocks reveals the will of the gods in a panoply of color and light. The breath of dragons explodes outward in answer to prayer. The goddess herself has been known to appear, if the moment is right.</p>
<p>     </p>
<p>     The bamboo tokens, holding luck or misfortune, lead seekers both to a message and a map. New poems, merging ancient Chinese mysticism and the passionate exhortations of the desert dwelling Sufi's, invite contemplation. Each poem also holds directions to a place within the bounds of Black Rock City, inviting exploration and discovery, and perhaps the answers you seek. Can you unravel the meaning in your poem? Do you dare follow its instructions, setting out into Black Rock City to visit the coordinates it gives? What might Mazu plan for you?</p>
<p>     </p>
<p>     You leave the temple, clutching message and map, and the sound of music finds your ears. Drums, gongs and shouting voices emerge from fantastical shapes, finned and spiny, nautilus-headed dancers and demons with a thousand eyes walk out of the dust, beckoning you to join them. You wonder, for a moment, if you are in fact in a desert, or in the memories of an ancient ocean, seeing the dreams of the sea floor dancing past. </p>

I am a huge fan of poster artists and when I first arrived in Austin the poster art scene blew my mind. I discovered incredible illustrators and artists in Texas who worked in the poster and rock world and who made incredible art. This poster is a homage to them. Also, aside from comics, the poster classics of the 60's and 70's have influenced my art, so to invoke the spirit of these times, I listened to lots of 70’s music (lots of Sabbath) while designing the poster.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468439339/lil_bec7tr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>The Dthulhu Limited Edition Poster</i></p><p>The Limited Edition Poster is based on the original concept for the duck which I made the morning after I had the dream.

Just like a regular rubber duck, (many quality rubber ducks are vinyl) Dthulhu can play in the tub and will also squeak when squeezed! What could be more fun than your very own Old One in the tub! Dthulhu started as a concept painting and was then sculpted digitally in a computer Dthulhu PackagingDthulhu will come in a full color box which will have the theme of the poster as well as a window so you can see The Old One sleeping behind the great doors in front of the palace in R'lyeh.Dthulhu's madness packagingAcross the front of the box is the chant of the cult members and on the right hand side is the translation:
""Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Dthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn""
""In his house at R'lyeh dead Dthulhu waits dreaming
On the opposite side is an original poem dedicated to Dthulhu and written by my wife Sasha Prince,
From the deep crawl eyes that creep with green and hidden terror.
They beckon those who crave its throes of sadness and despair.
They spread their slime and turn to grime the believers who in error
lose their hope and for proof grope after a deathly prayer.
 
The Dthulhu Limited Edition Poster (No longer available)
NOTE: As a bonus I will sign all of the art posters! In addition to the sculpture there is a limited edition poster to accompany Dthulhu in its new home. I am a huge fan of poster artists and when I first arrived in Austin the poster art scene blew my mind. I discovered incredible illustrators and artists in Texas who worked in the poster and rock world and who made incredible art. This poster is a homage to them. Also, aside from comics, the poster classics of the 60's and 70's have influenced my art, so to invoke the spirit of these times, I listened to lots of 70’s music (lots of Sabbath) while designing the poster.The Dthulhu Limited Edition PosterThe Limited Edition Poster is based on the original concept for the duck which I made the morning after I had the dream. It is always hard to remember exactly what we see in dreams and what we see doesn’t always mean it will translate to design. As any artist would, I tried to bridge the gap and the result was my first concept.Original concept paintingI also wanted to make sure it paid homage to the original story. As an Illustrator I have always thought about how to visually handle the non-Euclidean geometry of R'lyeh. It was fun to illustrate the city and its giant doors. If you look closely at the bottom you will see the Norwegian sailor, Gustaf Johansen.The poster is 18x24 inches and will be printed on high quality 100 lbs gloss paper suitable for framing.  Dthulhu Paper sculpture (No longer available)
Yes it’s true! You can download and build your very own paper-craft Dthulhu, (non-Euclidean geometry not included.) Children will love to build the Lord of Madness!

I was born in Argentina in the city of Neuquen, in the Patagonia region. At 17 years old, I enrolled in the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), studying Design of Image and Sound; with a group of students we create a space call 'El Subsuelo Audiovisual', it was a similar concept that i am presenting to you today; people gathering doing art, selling art, and offering any type of talents.  After school, I lived in Puerto Rico where I worked to coordinate numerous art events and assisted professional artists. I also worked in filmography as a producer and camera assistant.<br/>I am an independent woman, a hard worker, and goal oriented. I am creative, organised and practical. I have had a variety of other jobs, everything from managing a successful clothing store, to cleaning houses. No matter the type of work, I conduct myself in a professional manner, and strive to get the most out of every experience that I have. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474225872/nhtutmmdsknbfwcpbhwi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>LET'S DO THIS!</strong></p><p>To make my dream of developing the art community in San Juan del Sur a reality, I need your help. Together we can create a forum for the practice and appreciation of art in SJDS, Nicaragua and change peoples lives by providing a creative outlet and community space for tourists and locals alike. The Art Warehouse will bring our town’s residents and visitors together, blurring the line between the two groups. This is also a way of create a world conscience and awareness about art in general, people can live out of art and there are possibilities for everyone in this life that is willing to take them and make the best out of each situation in life. </p><p>The Warehouse seeks to unify the two social classes that coexist in SJDS. We hope to provide a unique opportunity for community growth, learning new languages, and the acceptance of cultural diversity. I have met many Nicaraguans who have been inspired by tourists in SJDS to travel the world and create friendly ties, also foreigners the same way around they learn and live from Experiences and get involve in the culture.  We want to offer professional support, a qualified person to teach art, receiving boys and girls in town who need and want to receive tools that would advance their lives.</p><p> </p><p><strong>FUNCTIONS OF THE BUSINESS: </strong></p><p>To make our mission sustainable, we will rely on multiple programs and their associated revenue streams. Each of these aspects of the business are outlined below.</p><p><u>ART GALLERY:</u> </p><p>There will be art displayed around the entire premises with its corresponding price tags and information about the piece and the artist. The personal working will be highly trained to sell art, and educated on each piece in the gallery. Sale online will be available for those who prefer it, facilitated by online payments and a 3rd party shipper. </p><p>We expect that commission on art sales will be our greatest source of revenue. At times we will buy art directly from artists for display in the gallery until it is sold. The other approach will be with artist that are interested in displaying and selling more than one piece.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474222682/slyu7hwsqkiuibj3qzgv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><u>WORKSHOPS: </u></p><p>We will offer spaces to rent out to teachers to give classes of any type of art.

We will also bring new things into town, like Theater Shows and Movie Nights. </p><p>This is one of the most beneficial areas because it will generate immediate return without taking on additional inventory. For these events, we will bring in 3rd party food and drink vendors and collect a commission for their sales. In addition to the revenue generated from food and drink sales, we expect art sales revenue to be elevated during these events. This concept have proven its viability with special Art Nights hosted at the Cerveceria SJDS, this event created by Maria Delgado* and Manu Barso  was a total success; the art sales increase a 70% every time, during each of the three events, average food and drink sales increased by more than 100% too.</p><p>I have also created an event series called <strong>White Canvas </strong>where invited guests pay for the opportunity to create art in a comunal setting (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/whitecanvasevent/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/whitecanvasevent/</a>).</p><p>*Maria Delgado: Nicaraguan Illustrator, Collage artist &amp; Publicist.

I was born in Argentina in the city of Neuquen, in the Patagonia region. At 17 years old, I enrolled in the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), studying Design of Image and Sound; with a group of students we create a space call 'El Subsuelo Audiovisual', it was a similar concept that i am presenting to you today; people gathering doing art, selling art, and offering any type of talents.  After school, I lived in Puerto Rico where I worked to coordinate numerous art events and assisted professional artists. I also worked in filmography as a producer and camera assistant.I am an independent woman, a hard worker, and goal oriented. I am creative, organised and practical. I have had a variety of other jobs, everything from managing a successful clothing store, to cleaning houses. No matter the type of work, I conduct myself in a professional manner, and strive to get the most out of every experience that I have. LET'S DO THIS!To make my dream of developing the art community in San Juan del Sur a reality, I need your help. Together we can create a forum for the practice and appreciation of art in SJDS, Nicaragua and change peoples lives by providing a creative outlet and community space for tourists and locals alike. The Art Warehouse will bring our town’s residents and visitors together, blurring the line between the two groups. This is also a way of create a world conscience and awareness about art in general, people can live out of art and there are possibilities for everyone in this life that is willing to take them and make the best out of each situation in life. The Warehouse seeks to unify the two social classes that coexist in SJDS. We hope to provide a unique opportunity for community growth, learning new languages, and the acceptance of cultural diversity. I have met many Nicaraguans who have been inspired by tourists in SJDS to travel the world and create friendly ties, also foreigners the same way around they learn and live from Experiences and get involve in the culture.  We want to offer professional support, a qualified person to teach art, receiving boys and girls in town who need and want to receive tools that would advance their lives. FUNCTIONS OF THE BUSINESS: To make our mission sustainable, we will rely on multiple programs and their associated revenue streams. Each of these aspects of the business are outlined below.ART GALLERY: There will be art displayed around the entire premises with its corresponding price tags and information about the piece and the artist. The personal working will be highly trained to sell art, and educated on each piece in the gallery. Sale online will be available for those who prefer it, facilitated by online payments and a 3rd party shipper. We expect that commission on art sales will be our greatest source of revenue. At times we will buy art directly from artists for display in the gallery until it is sold. The other approach will be with artist that are interested in displaying and selling more than one piece. WORKSHOPS: We will offer spaces to rent out to teachers to give classes of any type of art. We will supply the facilities and material if needed. We will work like a team to organise and promote these courses. The idea is that it is a permanent work station where people educate them self and explore around the place with total freedom. SPECIAL EVENTS: Once every 2 month or less we will put on Special Gallery Nights to promote sales and culture, offer an unforgettable experience, and help expose our mission to a larger audience. We will also bring new things into town, like Theater Shows and Movie Nights. This is one of the most beneficial areas because it will generate immediate return without taking on additional inventory. For these events, we will bring in 3rd party food and drink vendors and collect a commission for their sales. In addition to the revenue generated from food and drink sales, we expect art sales revenue to be elevated during these events. This concept have proven its viability with special Art Nights hosted at the Cerveceria SJDS, this event created by Maria Delgado* and Manu Barso  was a total success; the art sales increase a 70% every time, during each of the three events, average food and drink sales increased by more than 100% too.I have also created an event series called White Canvas where invited guests pay for the opportunity to create art in a comunal setting (www.facebook.com/whitecanvasevent/).*Maria Delgado: Nicaraguan Illustrator, Collage artist & Publicist. Maria is a young inspirational artist who want to embrace and bring art to peoples life, her preferred mediums are illustration and both analogue and digital collages. You can see her work in Instagram and contact her for freelance jobs.   https://www.instagram.com/mariadelgado33/STUDIO SPACE: We will offer traveling artists or others who don’t have their own studio space a place to work. We will rent the spaces for an affordable cost. These studio rentals will only be utilised pending availability and the class schedule. Pricing for studio space rental will be based on memberships v. one- time rentals. We will offer discounts to people purchasing packages for regular use as well as a higher single-use rate for travellers or others not interested in committing to our packages.COFFEE BAR: We will have a fully functioning coffee bar that will generate revenue by selling coffee and pastries to customers. This will also support the other arms of the business by giving people what they need to stay in the Warehouse for an extended period of time. It will also help drive traffic by attracting customers who are not solely interested in art. We will also sell coffee in bags and other local artisanal foods such as honey and craft beer.  ART SUPPLY SHOP: In addition to offering people a venue to practice their art or lessons, we will sell art supplies to accommodate customers needs. This area is key as customers will understand that the only other option to get art supplies is in Managua, 2 hours from San Juan. We will also create a system of rental equipment for items that are too bulky to carry on vacation, or too expensive, or used only periodically.

This year, I have been invited to participate in the Holy Grail Guitar Show, in Berlin, the best guitar show in the world. Only 115 luthiers are invited worldwide each year. I've also set up an opportunity to show my recent drawings in Berlin while we are there. This trip will be very expensive, actually far beyond my family's means, but it is an opportunity we would be foolish to turn down.

<p>Joan and my son Eoin will be traveling with me as I need helpers both to carry the guitars we will be taking and to help man the booth at the show. Also, a trip like this is important from a health standpoint for Eoin, who's world can become extremely small because of his autism. Truth in advertising, we are adding ten days in Paris as long as we're there because Eoin is intensely interested in the history of Paris.</p>
<p>The Holy Grail Guitar Show will expose my guitars to the world's most serious guitar collectors. Such exposure is particularly important for independent guitar makers because collectors really can't evaluate guitars without having the guitars in their hands. Even more so for my work, as it is often thought that my guitars are designed for visual impact alone. One has to play my guitars to realize that my first concerns are how they sound and how they play. One has to play my guitars to realize that I am striving to make guitars that are among the best in the world.</p>
<p>Because this show will put my guitars into the hands of collectors and players from all over the world, it has the potential to really change the amount of work I can sell, as well as radically change the long term trajectory of my career. The show gets exceptional coverage in all the important guitar publications. Just that coverage alone will create advertising for my work that I couldn't match any other way. </p>
<p>Finally, the drawings I make nowadays are, as you may know, ""difficult"". They are impossible to develop a market for in Portland. Berlin, however, is an entirely different story. Berlin is, most likely, the best conceivable place for my drawings to build a following, you know, its being so decadent and all. I would love to begin selling enough of my drawings to justify my committing more and more time to that part of my work.</p>
<p>So, the trip is about much more than just going to the show. Your contributions have the potential to change the future for my art and my family.

                the opportunity for connectivity and limitless access to information, 
                comes the obligation to be increasingly available to receive and 
                transmit; to be perpetually connected. The consequent erosion 
                of true leisure time, the blurring of the traditional professional/ 
                personal, public/ private dichotomies, and an information overload 
                are creating hitherto unknown levels of psychological pressure.
Controlling_Connectivity was an art project by artist Gretta Louw, which
                used the pervasiveness of internet-based social networking, and 
                the obligation as well as the opportunity for constant connection 
                with these platforms as a paradigm for a severe and systematic 
                disruption of normal, socially accepted patterns of life and interpersonal 
                interaction during a self-documented performance. Taking to its 
                natural extreme the notion that new technologies are increasingly 
                dictating our social interaction, professional life, and have 
                a far reaching effect on many other aspects of daily life, Louw completed a durational performance as she lived in the gallery space in complete 
                isolation except for contact through various social networking 
                sites on the internet. 
For 
                10 days the artist was available 24 hr/day for discussions, emails, 
                comments, or interviews - of both private and professional nature 
                - for any internet user wishing to take part in the project. All 
                necessary supplies were stored within the gallery and the windows 
                were blacked out to ensure that the environment was not normalised 
                by natural light or the social rhythms outside, but defined purely 
                by the internet connection to external participants.""(Text from Art Laboratory Berlin)Following the conclusion of the performance a solo exhibition in the gallery space, Art Laboratory Berlin, curated by Christian de Lutz and Regine Rapp, was installed.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With Turnstyle Studio, I hope to bring the experience of Glass Blowing to Toronto.  I've been working in glass for the past 8 years and running my company; <a href=""http://www.balanceglassworks.com/main/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Balance Glassworks</a> for the past 5.  My love of the material continues to grow.  Unfortunately, the overhead cost of running a glass studio can be prohibitively expensive.  Canada's small but vibrant and dedicated community of glass artists deserve a place to work that won't break the bank.  The only way to do this is to nurture that community and allow it to grow!  Through a graduated series of workshops, I hope to mold absolute beginners into self-sufficient glass artists in their own time and at their own pace.  Pulling from a larger pool of renters, the studio will develop a ""drop-in"" structure free of contracts and large monetary commitments.  Over $20 000 worth of equipment including a glass furnace with 200 lb. capacity has already been purchased and is currently in storage (Please inquire if you have questions about this equipment and you'll be sent a full list).   I know the interest is there, the missing piece is the facility.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>With each donation Turnstyle Glass Studio comes that much closer to becoming a reality.  The posted goal is meant to cover rent and utilities in the first year of operation.  High-level donors will receive placement in beginner level classes or studio time depending on their degree of training.  Every dollar helps and perks include items from the Balance Glassworks catalogue!  With your help and a bit of luck, the studio will be up and running for 2014 and become a resource for professional and amateur artists interested in working with and being educated in hot glass. <br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Like I said, every loony helps, but even if you can't spare it, you can help the Canadian glass community simply by sharing this campaign with someone that you think might be interested.  Please come down for a visit next year and see what we're up to!<br/><br/>The Perks!<br/><br/>Hand-Sculpted Glass Wishbone<br/><p></p>

With Turnstyle Studio, I hope to bring the experience of Glass Blowing to Toronto.  I've been working in glass for the past 8 years and running my company; Balance Glassworks for the past 5.  My love of the material continues to grow.  Unfortunately, the overhead cost of running a glass studio can be prohibitively expensive.  Canada's small but vibrant and dedicated community of glass artists deserve a place to work that won't break the bank.  The only way to do this is to nurture that community and allow it to grow!  Through a graduated series of workshops, I hope to mold absolute beginners into self-sufficient glass artists in their own time and at their own pace.  Pulling from a larger pool of renters, the studio will develop a ""drop-in"" structure free of contracts and large monetary commitments.  Over $20 000 worth of equipment including a glass furnace with 200 lb. capacity has already been purchased and is currently in storage (Please inquire if you have questions about this equipment and you'll be sent a full list).   I know the interest is there, the missing piece is the facility.


The ImpactWith each donation Turnstyle Glass Studio comes that much closer to becoming a reality.  The posted goal is meant to cover rent and utilities in the first year of operation.  High-level donors will receive placement in beginner level classes or studio time depending on their degree of training.  Every dollar helps and perks include items from the Balance Glassworks catalogue!  With your help and a bit of luck, the studio will be up and running for 2014 and become a resource for professional and amateur artists interested in working with and being educated in hot glass. 

Other Ways You Can HelpLike I said, every loony helps, but even if you can't spare it, you can help the Canadian glass community simply by sharing this campaign with someone that you think might be interested.  Please come down for a visit next year and see what we're up to!The Perks!Hand-Sculpted Glass Wishbone

<p>Most of you know my work as a composer and for using performance art practices in musical pieces. Since my first Gallery show at the Diapason Gallery in New York (curated by Michael J Schumacher in 2004) I've also been creating sound objects   that were shown in different exhibitions. This exhibition is the first time where I will be able to present these works alongside performances of performance-music works as part of one single work. <br/></p>
<p>The exhibition will be accompanied by a catalog, which will be a box stuffed with additional works to those presented in the exhibition. We are asking for your support to produce this catalog.</p>
<p><b>The Catalog</b></p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p> The catalog is a box that will be filled with different things. Among them new and old images of graphic scores and text scores,  and a recording of three new electronic works on fixed media. It will also include three artistic collaborations with the
photographer Ron Amir, as well as the poets Richard Zenith and Zohar Eitan. These collaborations will
be presented as  greeting cards, employing  images and texts provided by these artists, upon opening the cards they will play new electronic pieces that are based on materials provided by these artists. In the box there will be a transcription of a talk with the political activist and Philosophy professor Anat Matar discussing <i>secrets</i>. And finally the box will include texts relating to my work by  Dr. Adi Luria (Tel Aviv University), Prof. David Grubbs (Brooklyn College, CUNY, NY),  Noam Ben Zeev (Haaretz), and Liora Belford (curator.) The catalog will be in three languages (English, Hebrew, and Arabic,) and is designed by Harel Schriber who designed my website. <br/></p>
<p>The cost of producing this catalog is prohibitive. It includes  design and translation hours, as well as the cutting and folding of the boxes, the high-quality printing of images, the production of fixed media sounds, and the design and printing of the sound cards with extra memory. The costs of producing these in Israel is higher then most places. If this fundraising campaign will raise more money then is necessary for the production of the catalog we will use the money left over to support the exhibition which is not fully funded yet.<br/></p>

<br/><p><b>The Exhibition</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>The exhibition space of the Center will be
divided into islands of isolated realms of sounds and images, surrounded by a strictly coordinated
bedlam. The score for the composition will serve as an explanatory map for the show; it will be handed
to the visitor at the center entrance as a score for a single performer, i.e the visitor. The exhibition will be a
performative space of sound and objects,
and will exhibit performance works as if they are sound installations. The encounter with these un-
announced performances and their performers (such as dancers, musicians), may provide a new
subjective experience. The inclusion of live performers as part of an exhibition that lasts three months increases the budget of the exhibition substantially.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>The 'Composition for Two Floors and a Corridor' will also include an outdoor sound installation in the museum's garden,
sound works for cellular phones, a listening room and a sound work that will transform one floor to a
huge 'sound box'. The 'sound box' will be full of sounds but mostly empty of objects. Some of the doors will
stay shut, while sound and light coming out of the sealed room will join the composition. Other doors
will screech, empowering the visitor as a performer while walking through the 'music box', controlling
not only his/her experience of the work, but also the other visitors' experience.
</p>
</div>

The museum is providing about a fourth of the budget, and the exhibition won support from the highly competitive cultural committee of Mifal Hapais. We are still waiting to hear results from other applications we made. <br/><p><br/></p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>
<p>If you read this text all the way to here you already helped the piece. If you would consider contributing that would be great, and if you can let other people know about it.

The museum is providing about a fourth of the budget, and the exhibition won support from the highly competitive cultural committee of Mifal Hapais. We are still waiting to hear results from other applications we made. 
Thanks for your help
If you read this text all the way to here you already helped the piece. If you would consider contributing that would be great, and if you can let other people know about it. According to the people of Indiegogo it helps if people ""make noise"" about a campaign so please do, make lots of noise. Thanks",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b>Allow me a triumphant journey.</b><br/>
</h2>My name is Jeffrey Collins, I am a painter of over 15 years. I have been based in Columbus Ohio for most of that time. I have recently been broadening my reach to the New York City area. I was blessed to be included in a curated exhibition called Materialists by painter Anders Knutsson, along with fellow painters, Nils Hill and Art Guerra. The exhibition took place in January 2014 at The Painting Center in Chelsea, Manhattan. Along with two entries in the Sideshow Gallery yearly group exhibitions. They have brought knowledge of my work to many in the NY art world.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.jeffreycollins.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.jeffreycollins.us</a><br/><br/>A little over a month ago I was informed of a new Art Residency in Tamaqua Pennsylvania by a friend of mine who lives there. I've visited Tamaqua many times since two colleagues live there and have made the city of Tamaqua their second home. It's a great city for hiking and riding bikes, or just hanging out and enjoying the passage of time. Which is exactly what a painter needs to make great work. I was informed about two weeks later that I was on the shortlist, and a week later was told I would be the first Artist in Residence. I have been so happy about this opportunity since I got that call.<br/><br/>I decided I needed to begin this campaign because I knew I didn't have enough funds to get me through the 3 months of the residency. This is what I am asking your help for. This is my first art residency and I'm so thrilled about it, but I really need your help to get me to the finish line. I've been waiting for something like this to happen for so long and it's finally happening. I just don't want to fall on my face while it is happening.<br/><br/>Your contributions will help me to paint at least ten new paintings, and hopefully a few of them will allow me to really stretch the boundaries of scale in my painting. I have been working on using different materials as my substrates and that material (Acrylic Yarn) is so fun and awesome to use, I'm looking forward to really digging into the ideas it will bring and how I can bring them to life.

oftentimes manifested in visual language our mind works in patterns. If we

<p><i><b>WHY</b></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In
this project I am looking for visuals that bridge and connect the evolution of
visual patterns and mythology, and the evolution of the patterns in our mind.

connection to nature, the alternative cosmology in comparison to the complexity
and speed of the exponentially evolving world we live in. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With this project I

evolving. As part of the research process I look at the visual patterns of Andean folk art,
patterns in nature, thought patterns that I recognize in my own behavior and
that of friends and family, and at patterns in other areas of design and
science, like parametric design in architecture and quantum physics. 
WHY
In
this project I am looking for visuals that bridge and connect the evolution of
visual patterns and mythology, and the evolution of the patterns in our mind.
It is the contrast between the ancient roots of the indigenous art, the close
connection to nature, the alternative cosmology in comparison to the complexity
and speed of the exponentially evolving world we live in. With this project I
wish to fuse new impulses with age-old wisdom, and create a new artistic
connection between Peru and Europe. My work aims to create access to inner
spaces that we have forgotten or cannot see. By going back to the roots of one
of the major ancient civilizations I hope to reveal some of the keys to our
inner being.
YOU
For
all this money is truly needed!  Part of
the travel costs and research materials are already paid for, but to realize
the full potential of the project additional 3300 € are needed. I already took care of the plane ticket from Amsterdam to
Peru, research travel to the Ethnographic museum in Berlin, a large part of the
books and material for sketches, and I will cover the living costs for my stay
in Peru, so basically I need your contribution to pay for the materials, set up
of the exhibition, PR and fund part of the inland travels. 1500€ painting material +  800€ exhibition setup
and PR + 200€ additional literature + 800€ inland travel. Any excess funding will go into the next show in the Netherlands.So if you can
support what you can to make it happen, I will be truly grateful! Will you help? THANK YOU!Love,AnnikaSome of the Perks:Painting Series 'The Internet Loves You', Acrylics, 40 x 30 cmLino Prints 40 x 30 cm",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Our names are Jessieh Ruth and Samantha Jolene. We have been collaborating as artists for over seven years. The purpose of this campaign is to seek financial support from those who have come to know us and our work (collectively and as individuals) during that time. We are embarking on a life-changing adventure with the ultimate goal of establishing a solid and enriching performance ensemble in Philadelphia, PA. Together with Philly-based dancer and choreographer Maggie Donoghue, we've been fortunate to receive much needed community support and rehearsal space through the Artist Residency Program with Mascher Space Cooperative. This process has already begun and we, as a group, are scheduled to perform this September as part of the 2014 Philly Fringe Festival as OTHER CASE NOTES ENSEMBLE. Each of us views this current opportunity as a continuation of the educations we've received and value so much. This is a simultaneously ambitious and humbling endeavor and simply put; we <i>need</i> your help getting there. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Ask: </h3> <p>While we've both acquired employment in our post-grad lives, have been making every effort to save for this opportunity and have received valuable support from our respective families; we do not want to enter this decision blindly. We know that we will need additional funds moving forward. This is why we are asking for your help in this way.</p>
<p>The goal we've set is not a random dollar amount to serve simply as a security blanket, but a necessity. With that in mind, we've made every effort to keep the amount we are asking for modest and realistically achievable. There is no expectation on our end with regards to how much our supporters may be able to give financially. What has been most important for us in making the decision to reach out in this way; has been the reminder that we do, in fact, have supporters. So, thank you. </p>
<p>For those of you interested in giving, we think disclosure of how your gifts will be used is appropriate. It's reassuring to have a sense of where the money is going and what it's being used for. Currently, we can provide you the following information for how your gifts will be allocated:</p>
<p>From the total amount raised in this campaign;</p>
<p>65% - Relocation Expenses (i.e. moving expenses from South Carolina to Philadelphia, preliminary housing arrangements, etc.)</p>
<p>25%- Directly to OTHER CASE NOTES ENSEMBLE (i.e. company insurance, additional rehearsal and performance space not covered by our residency with the Mascher Space Co-op, the launching of a company profile and website, etc.)</p>
<p>10%- Goes into a fund we've already established to help us give back to the Drama Department of the South Carolina Governor's School for the Arts and Humanities where we first began our exploration as students, actors, and collaborators. </p>

<p>In closing, we already want to acknowledge the time you've taken to consider this campaign. While we hope that you are able to contribute via monetary support, we do not see this as the only means of helping us at this time. Please, even if you personally cannot give at this time, spread the word about helping us out.

<p>Shalom, my name is Chen Winkler and I am an Israeli sculptor, photographer, and artist who has served as a general in the reserves for 30 years. Over these three decades I have been blessed with the unique opportunity to behold up close the lives of the everyday heroes that put on the green uniform to defend our homeland at a moments notice. The intimate encounter with reservists over this period of time have long sat within me, taking on a mature form finally ready for artistic expression. This gallery is the culmination of years of artistic contemplation how best to portray to the wider populace the true, human visage of these unique and unsung heroes.<br/><br/>I have started this campaign with the knowledge that I am not alone in my desire to convey the immense gratitude for the citizens who suit up to defend Israel at the drop of a helmet. I know that countless others feel as indebted as I am to these defenders and their vigilance that plays a vital role in the safety of the State of Israel, the Jewish people, and the entire world. </p>

<p>My name is Paul.</p>
<p>I am a medical student from Zurich. But besides my studies i have developed a passion for creating art. It all started in school. I visited the Rudolf Steiner School, where art and music are one of the really important topics. So from early on i loved to work with paper, pencil and wood.</p>
<p>Over the years i spent more and more time to get my ideas into paintings, pictures, sculptures, prints. I started carving big woodsculptures with the chainsaw, small sculptures with carving knifes. In addition I discovered the technique of screenprinting, to get my woodwork onto paper. That gives me the opportunity to convert the three-dimensional sculptures into two-dimensional art prints. Hereby the motive gets its own new expression but stays connected to the main focus of my work, the woodsculpture. </p>
<p>Given that i have a lot of ideas for new screen-prints in my mind but only limited time, money and equipment, i would be super happy, if some of you could support me and help to get my ideas and projects on paper. Thank you very much!</p>

</div></div>","My name is Paul.
I am a medical student from Zurich. But besides my studies i have developed a passion for creating art. It all started in school. I visited the Rudolf Steiner School, where art and music are one of the really important topics. So from early on i loved to work with paper, pencil and wood.
Over the years i spent more and more time to get my ideas into paintings, pictures, sculptures, prints. I started carving big woodsculptures with the chainsaw, small sculptures with carving knifes. In addition I discovered the technique of screenprinting, to get my woodwork onto paper. That gives me the opportunity to convert the three-dimensional sculptures into two-dimensional art prints. Hereby the motive gets its own new expression but stays connected to the main focus of my work, the woodsculpture.

An after-school workshop program in visual arts and music in Accra, Ghana

Where youth in Nima, Accra participate in the arts creatively, educationally, and vocationally
Acquiring the skills, potential, and confidence to express themselves through art
Gaining access to professional platforms to showcase their talent
What's our history?

A local grassroots effort, NMA was founded on-the-ground in the summer of 2011
In our first program, we involved six schools, 30 students, 25 local artists, renowned painters Larry Otoo, Wiz Kudowor, and Professor Ablade Glover, and Nima’s own hip life music stars V.I.P and F.O.I
We had seven business sponsors, raised $1,100 in funds, and were featured on four TV and radio stations.
We inaugurated the first arts event of its kind in that area
What has NMA done since?

We thought of NMA as a one-time event, but everyone wanted to keep it going!
Since then, we’ve participated in a number of painting, music, and workshop programs
And gained the support of many top artists and arts organizations in Accra
And now?

We are wrapping this term's workshop sessions, getting ready for a banging opening celebration that will blow last year’s away – with an all-day arts festival at Kaokudi Park and an evening exhibition and music show at the Alliance Française
We’ve done it all practically without funds, purely through the dedication of the artists and volunteers, and the talent and motivation of the students
We aim to prove our success this July in order to establish ourselves as a long-term sustainable program
The Impact
What do we need right now?

Funds for the supplies and basic costs of the event
What do we aim for the future?

Building the foundations to support continued NMA workshops
A transformed and revitalized Nima with a strong ecosystem of collaboration among inspirational established artists, young local artists, and Nima students
What We Need & What You Get
Contribute to...

Paints: $400
Wooden board: $150
Canvas: $150

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Skump is the creative persona of a young Oakland-based artist who has worked for many years in an underground environment, honing and sharpening his crafts, and has finally dug his way out into the real world. As an artist with visions of aesthetic creations always amassing in his mind, he needs a little help in making these aspirations into physical real world items. Sure to be infused with certain magical properties, they take time and funding. Time Skump can find, but with a day job in tow and rent to pay, the funds are something more scarce. Basically Skump just wants to make stuff for people like you, he just needs a little help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions would directly fund art supplies, thereby enabling Skump to fully indulge his creative urges and grow more easily as an artist and as a visual contributor to society. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Skump Needs &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So what does Skump need the money for? The initial goal is $600, and that can be broken down into two initial projects:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>1. 1"" button maker + Supplies - $300 = tons of fun buttons to give away and leave as small gifts </p>
<p>2. Skumps first wave of stickers! - $300 = over 800 stickers of various designs on nice UV coated Vinyl</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So what do you get for being so generous? For starters all donations are tax deductible, but also you get a bunch of fun art stuffs made by Skump himself and membership into The Skump Super-Fun Adventure Club! Including weekly updates as to how the projects your donations helped fund are progressing, free awesome swag, and discounts on future larger scale art projects! And last but not least, Skumps infinite thanks and appreciation for your help in making his dream and his life closer to the same thing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you like Skumps artwork at least a little bit, but don't feel like contributing, thats just fine too! Maybe you have some friends who might like it, and you wouldn't mind sharing or tweeting about Skump to others? It'd take a second and would benefit Skumps cause just as much as monetary donation!</p>

The first 3 people to pre-order a limited edition print will receive an original drawing on paper with dedication! (Sorry sold out!)

About me
I'm Vacon Sartirani, a visual artist from Italy living in Berlin. (You can find my artwork at www.vaconsartirani.com)

I decided to use Indiegogo to raise the funds for my first limited edition of high-quality, professionally scanned and printed giclée prints.
For everybody who loves my art but can't afford it, this is a very good opportunity to purchase a long-lasting, awesome-looking, professional quality original artwork ad a very affordable price.


The editions


Digital rendering of the final editions' appearance and scale
(framing is just for example and NOT included)
 
I decided to offer limited editions of these three artworks: ""The Passion of lovers"", ""La prigioniera"" and ""Ein Abgrund (Der Fernseher)"".
The original paintings will be scanned by a professional Cruse fine-art scanner, which will give a high-fidelity, high-detailed digital image in a 1:1 scale.
I will then make a professional fine-art printing studio realize up to 30 copies editions using high-quality material such as professional archival pigment ink Epson Ultrachrome K3 Vivid Magenta, and award-winning acid-free Harman by Hahnemühe museum paper, that will ensure the perfect rendering of tone and vibrant colors of my original red and blue. The combination of such inks and paper is especially for professional fine art prints, and is estimated to last unchanged for 200 years.
Every copy will be signed and numbered, and then put on sale on my website.
 
Both the professional scanning and printing are expensive, so I make a pre-order special offer to funding the edition's kick-start.
 
I offer to pre-order customers a special 25% discount on every print!!

</div></div>","My name is Scott Kraske and I am
proposing on behalf of my team and community the construction of an
art project for delivery at Burning Man: Rites of Passage in August
2011 called:

“Final
Passage” a sculpture with the elements (summary)

Final
Passage
Connecting
all forms of creation evolved and inspired with the elements
that
gave them food, energy and faith. It is symbolic 

of
the beginning to life lived and renewal. 


After
Burning Man that ends on September 6th, 2011, it is the
artist's anticipation to work with either BRAF (Black Rock Arts
Foundation) or NAF (Nevada Arts Foundation) to find a home for this
piece in the city of Las Vegas Art District or other part of the
city. 


Imagine
the Tree of Life meets the River Styx standing
brilliantly in the desert shimmering with 5 branches, each holding a
small flame in a tall glass chimney, surrounded by sparkling leaves.
Standing 22 feet tall, this beautiful monochromatic tree will shimmer
in the glowing light from the 5 flames; one on each limb. (After
burning man the flames may be removed and fitted with electrical
lighting unless otherwise)

The
piece will be accompanied by two arches representing two halves of a
passage where through a boat is passing symbolizing the transition.
The ornate metal arches will also have a propane feed helping to keep
visitors warm by night while casting a colorful light through the
arch. 


The
orientation and acoustics of the project is based on a lot of
religious and spiritual elements but gives the visitor the ability to
take away anything they need from it. 


The
final construction will result in an art piece with a lot of texture
and it will use light in a lot of ways to amplify the concept, either
by the light generated by the piece itself of from any natural
ambient light. 


Theme
of the Project
There
are a lot of spiritual elements combined in this tree, none of which
are primarily from a single religion. Since faith is a rite unto
itself the perceived meaning is relevant to the individual
experiencing the piece. 


The tree
represents a human connection to nature. In mythology the Tree of
Life concept has various origins in cultures all over the world; the
start of life, knowledge or even a basic desire to understand where
we were coming from. 


And then
for many death represented by the boat is less seen as a finality but
a transition into a new life or even a higher plain of existence. The
boat in the water represents the Ferry Man who transported the dead
to the underworld, but in this case the boat carries one through the
arch from the old to the new.

One
additionally interesting factor for anyone who might make a note of
it, though it is not specifically demonstrated in the overall
construction, the sculpture maintains all 5 elements of nature;
earth, water, air, fire and spirit. 


Project
Schedule

2011 the framework with installed components including gas, air
and electrical and be able to be assembled. Then begin applying skin
with re-proposed metals and test acoustics; all framing and general
foundation work should be done and ready for texturing. All functions
should be working and tested.

1 Jun
2011 should be near completion and ready for full 100% testing.
Will begin tweaking and applying decorative pieces and then store for
use.

begin setting up.


Construction
The
core structure will be built from an aluminum frame welded securely
in sections so that it can be easily assembled on any site where it
will be displayed. Standing 22 feet tall 


The bark
of the tree will be created using re-purposed metal strips or cut
from larger pieces of re purposed metal  welded to the skeletal frame
of aluminum in varying textures so that it remains a solid structure.
It is also important for the safety of people wanting to make
physical contact that we will avoid sharp edges.

On top
of each of 5 limbs will be a base to where a propane fed flame with a
tall clear chimney possibly made from glass/pyrex or other material
safe with the flame effect.


Copper
	tubing will lead from the base that will house a propane tank to the
	main hub at the top 3rd
	of the 3 piece skeleton core of the tree.


A
	knob at the base will easily shut the flame down as needed.


5
	lines will feed one to the end of each limb a flame burning low in a
	chimney glass tube. 




An arch
feeds off of one side with the same aluminum skeleton over another
feature. This arch will be given a faux stone surface also cut from
re-purposed metal. 



The
	arch will be hallow and anchored on the ground and locked into a
	mechanism on the side of the tree.


A slot
running on the interior ring of the arch will hold a reflective
metallic surface x 2. Each side is reflective and gives the illusion
of being see through.

A final
feature for the base of the structure will be a trough representing
the river Styx with a canoe inside, cut in half, with each side end
of the canoe on opposite sides of the reflection.


The
	canoe halves will be anchored to the constructed base of the trough.



A
	very shallow pool of water (or facsimile) will be in the base of the
	miniature river bed.


The
	trough will have the illusion it passes through the arch.


One
	side of the archway is monochromatic.


The
	second side is in full color showing renewal.



Crowning
the piece at the top will be where smaller branches will be held
holding a light gauge wire decorated with white, silver and black
metal discs secured solidly to the rods designed to catch the lights
of the fire and any ambient light. 




Light
	gauge wire will filter out of a crown with the small disks welded to
	them. 



The
	wires will provide movement and the small disks will provide a
	twinkling light effect.


Will
	provide a fullness and foliage to the top of the tree.

The
project will be built on his brick and mortar business location
before it is transported to Burning Man to be assembled in sections
for easy transportation.

internationally known artist of glass and oil paintings. Robby will
be hand blowing the glass (pyrex) chimneys that will sit on each
branch of the tree. 


Robbie

well and is excited about Final Passage project as an opportunity to
introduce him to this world of artists.

Robbie
moved to Las Vegas recently after having spent much of 2010 traveling
through Europe before leaving his home country of Australia. 


Shane
is a 5 year veteran of Burning Man with his beautiful wife Liz who
might be recognized from their shark car that premiered at Burning
Man 3 years ago. Shaney is responsible for uniting this exciting team
and will be designing and implementing the ignition system for the
propane fed flames on each limb. 


Shaney
is an engineer and electronics technician for XYZ company based out
of Henderson, Nevada. 


The
Team will grow as we add other members of the team to assure the
safety, assembly, and break down of the art piece before and after
Burning Man 2011. 



Playa
Placement
It is
with great hope that this placement will have the esteemed and
wonderfully placed I had in 2010, when I was very fortunate for that
project. 





The
Financing
Scott
Kraske (as StudioSK) is looking at three main channels of fund
raising so that construction can begin no later than the beginning of
March 2011. 



posting
	a project video and fund raising campaign on IndieGoGo.com


local
	fund raising effort in the Southern Nevada community


and
	applying for Grant recognition from Burning Man and NAF (Nevada Arts
	Foundation)



None of
these sources are guaranteed and not a single one will pay for the
entire project. Having used IndieGoGo with some success last year it
is hopeful, that with better planning and more knowledge, this year
will yield the funding needed to complete and place the project. 


Many of
the services needed to assemble the project will be donated, but the
caveat will be obtaining the supplies needed for construction.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns
