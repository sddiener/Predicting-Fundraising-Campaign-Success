<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our Story</span><br/>
</h2><p></p><p>We first came up with the idea for KEYCHARGE when we couldn't find a backup charger for our smartphones that was compact, smart, simple, and elegant enough for everyday use. Everything that was on the market was too large to conveniently take with you everywhere.</p><p>We wanted to create something that you wouldn't have to worry about forgetting, a true back-up juice pack that you would always be able to have on you all the time. This was when we first started sketching a design for KEYCHARGE and also started looking for a suitable battery that was small enough to fit in a keychain unit and give smartphones true extended battery life. We tested 800-1200mAh batteries and finally decided on 1000mAh battery because it gave us the perfect balance of battery life and design flexibility for the keychain unit.</p><p>Through several iterations of sketch prototypes and testing with an experienced manufacturer we now have a production ready model that we are very happy with and ready to deliver to you.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/505244/files/20140413105400-Concept_Ideation.jpg?1397411640"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/505246/files/20140413105430-3D_Prototype.jpg?1397411670"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Our Plan<br/>

Our Story
We first came up with the idea for KEYCHARGE when we couldn't find a backup charger for our smartphones that was compact, smart, simple, and elegant enough for everyday use. Everything that was on the market was too large to conveniently take with you everywhere.We wanted to create something that you wouldn't have to worry about forgetting, a true back-up juice pack that you would always be able to have on you all the time. This was when we first started sketching a design for KEYCHARGE and also started looking for a suitable battery that was small enough to fit in a keychain unit and give smartphones true extended battery life. We tested 800-1200mAh batteries and finally decided on 1000mAh battery because it gave us the perfect balance of battery life and design flexibility for the keychain unit.Through several iterations of sketch prototypes and testing with an experienced manufacturer we now have a production ready model that we are very happy with and ready to deliver to you.Our Plan
We are now ready to bring you KEYCHARGE. After thorough testing and quality inspection of numerous prototypes. We now have our production-ready models ready. There are however a few key steps we need to take to deliver KEYCHARGE.With your help, we need to:

<p>Got your attention?  Think about all the time you spend updating your social networks, entering status messages, photos and comments, friending, check-ins; you get the drift. You agree to their terms and conditions and guess what?!   They areno longer your photos, they are Facebook’s photos!   It is no longer your stream of updates, it is Twitte'rs!   And this is all for the purpose of showing you ads in return for your social content. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://joinsocialsync.com/cf/logos.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This is YOUR content, not the social networks’ content.  This is an investment you make in time and effort updating your family, friends and business associates on what is going on in your life.  Due to the ease of use with these social networks, you are basically creating a living journal or diary of your life.  Remember GeoCities, SixDegrees, MSN Spaces, Friendster, MySpace or Google Orkut?   They all went out of business or closed down and millions of people lost their social content.  Well, it is time to take your content back! </p>
<p>Take photos, for example; everyone is using their iPhones or Android phones to upload pictures to social networking sites because it’s so darn simple!  I know of some people who have over 1,000 photos uploaded into Facebook from pictures taken on their iPhone.  Crazy, but makes sense because it is so easy to do.   Well, how do you download those hundreds of photos to your computer?   That is not an easy task and it’s by design!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://joinsocialsync.com/cf/photos.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>Photos are just one example; our goal is to bring your ENTIRE social network content back to you. Just think about pulling back all of the comments on your photos or all of your status messages. Even better, think about pulling back contact information on all of your friends and business associates! And even better, no sponsored ads in the application! That is just awesome! </span></p>
<h1><strong>The Pitch</strong></h1>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://joinsocialsync.com/cf/sslogo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Well, for some reason, the social networking sites think they own your content.  NOPE.  Well, it is a part of the user agreement you clicked when you signed up for their service.  But, it is YOUR content and you need it back. </span><strong>socialsync</strong><span> is the tool that allows you to preserve and manage your social network life.  Just imagine having all the messages you post across all those social networking sites available as your own personal timeline.  That is cool!</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://joinsocialsync.com/cf/status.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>As you can imagine, everything will be searchable so you can quickly find information you are looking for. Want to get to a specific photo? Click it and we’ll take you to the Pictures folder where that photo is stored on your computer. Google Picasa, or whichever photo software you use can now index all of those photos. All of your social content can easily be managed and maintained in socialsync on your computer. Beautiful!</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://joinsocialsync.com/cf/photosq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Another great feature will be the ability to sync all your social friends and associate contact information right to your computer as vCards. What is a vCard you may ask? It is basically the business card for each of your contacts. If your friends included their contact information like phone, email and mailing address, that will be automatically pulled to your computer and available in your other software programs. Connected!</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://joinsocialsync.com/cf/vcards.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p>How will we do it? socialsync can manage all your social network accounts, connecting to those services, pulling your content and saving it to your Windows PC or MAC computers. Information is sync’d directly from those social networks onto your computer. You can setup syncing frequency for each service and socialsync will do it for you behind the scenes. Simple! You can even backup your content to cloud services like Dropbox, Microsoft Skydrive and Google Drive, and easily access it on your smartphone too!</p>
<p>Oh yeah, we will also have an iPhone and Android version available at a later date.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://joinsocialsync.com/cf/iphone.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>Cost </h1>
<p><strong>socialsync</strong> will be a commercial piece of software available for the Windows and MAC operating systems. There will be two versions of the software, Facebook and All Social Editions. The Facebook edition is just for Facebook and the All Social edition includes all social networking platforms (linkedIn, Twitter, and Google+ for now). We are estimating a cost of $5.95 (USD) for the Facebook Edition and $10.95 for the All Social version. </p>
<h1>Funding Uses </h1>
<p>We have a working prototype for Windows that connects to Facebook and is already sync’ing content. This has been funded out-of-pocket and developed as time permits. When you develop part-time, you get part-time software. We want to make this the perfect piece of software found on your Windows or MAC computers. We thought it would be great to offer an opportunity to Indiegogo members to participate and help us finish out this much needed software.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Development</em>: Funds will be used to add full-time developers to our team, in order to build out content syncs for other social networks like Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+ and Instagram. We’ll have a couple of developers focused on the Windows development and a few others focused on MAC development, as we believe we need to supply software for both operating systems.</li>
<li>
<em>Product Marketing</em>: Funds will also be used for product marketing to get the word out in a BIG WAY, as we believe this is an important piece of software everyone should be utilizing in the social networking space.</li>
</ul><h1>How long will it take?</h1>
<p>Since our prototype was first completed in Windows utilizing Facebook, our tentative plan is to release a beta 10 weeks after funding.   The MAC version should take 10 to 12 weeks.  Then, every 5 to 6 weeks, we will send out FREE updates that will include new social networking platforms and minor features.</p>
<div>
<h1>Does more funding mean more stuff?</h1>
<p>Absolutely! We  can hire a bigger and more diverse team so that we can add support for more languages and potentially even cooler things than we’ve discussed here.  We have a roadmap of ideas of making <strong>socialsync</strong> the center of your social networking universe.  So, if we get overfunded, we will be able to provide even more features quicker to our community of supporters.</p>
<h1>Can I Participate?</h1>
<p>You bet!  Our Indiegogo founders will be actively involved in the development and beta testing of our software.   Software is never designed and built just by developers; you need an active community to participate.  We figured if you have a vested interested, you will provide great feedback, too!  We look forward to working with you on <strong>socialsync</strong>.</p>

<h2>The miniSWARM is...</h2>
<p><strong>A smart choice: </strong>The miniSWARM is a versatile USB stick-sized wireless Arduino development board. It’s as powerful as the Arduino Mega and has the wireless capabilities of an XBee radio, but we’ve made it a fraction of the cost of an Arduino + radio shield - cheap enough to leave in any project.</p>
<p><strong>A wireless powerhouse:</strong> We’ve ported Atmel’s LightWeight Mesh library to Arduino, and made it dead simple to form and manage a network. We took the fuss out of communication diagnostics by integrating range testing features transparently into the library. On top of that, we are developing over-the-air programming (also built into the library) that allows the miniSWARM to be programmed wirelessly. You’ll never need to pop it out of your circuit for a software update!<br/><br/></p>
<center><img alt=""miniSWARM board labeled"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indevice.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/miniSWARM-board-nologo..jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></center>
<p><strong>For Arduino and more:</strong> Out of the box miniSWARM uses the Arduino platform for software development and programming and supports the standard libraries (digital i/o, analog, pwm, serial, I2C etc.). However, we’ve added an (optional) external antenna connector, ICSP and JTAG support for advanced users who want to work with a different IDE or use Atmel’s BitCloud ZigBee Pro API.</p>
<p><strong>A complete package:</strong> miniSWARM doesn’t require any additional hardware or shields, not even a USB cable. Just plug the USB edge connector into your PC and upload your sketch. There is a standard LiPo battery connector and charger on-board for providing power to your miniSWARM and application circuit.<img alt=""open source hardware"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indevice.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/open-source-hardware.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p><strong>Open source:</strong> We proudly support the open-source hardware and software community. Once the campaign is complete all of the documentation, PCB design files and source code will be made available on our <a href=""http://indevice.wikidot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wiki</a>.</p>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>

</div>
<h3><strong>$20,000 goal</strong></h3>
<p>We need your support to raise $20,000 for the <strong>first production run</strong> of the miniSWARM. Our goal is to make miniSWARM affordable enough to leave in your projects without burning a hole in your wallet. We've cleverly designed the board to be minimalistic (although loaded with features), but we can't bring down the cost to our target of <strong>$25</strong> without manufacturing hundreds of them.</p>
<div><strong>The funds will be used for:</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>PCB fabrication of the first batch</li>
<li>Electronic component stock</li>
<li>PCB assembly labour and testing</li>
<li>Firmware programming and functionality testing</li>
<li>Quality control</li>
<li>Packaging and shipping</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><strong>$35,000 stretch goal SHIELD ADAPTER </strong></h3>
<div>We're not interested in re-inventing the wheel with miniSWARM-only shields. We plan on manufacturing a shield adapter for the miniSWARM so it can be mated with hundreds of standard Arduino shields. If we reach the stretch goal the shield will be available with the release of the miniSWARM in mid-June 2013! In the mean-time, the <a href=""https://www.sparkfun.com/products/7914"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">protoshield</a> can be used.</div>
<h3>Distribution</h3>
<div>Once the first batch is manufactured and we ship out all the units to our backers, the miniSWARM will be available to distributors for resale.</div>
<h3>Shipping</h3>
<p>All but one of our perks come with free shipping to the US/Canada. International shipping is $5 for orders under $250, and $10 for oders above $250. Shipping periods are:</p>
<p><strong><strong>CANADA</strong> - </strong>5 - 10 days</p>
<p><strong>USA</strong> - 1.5 - 2 weeks</p>
<p><strong>INTERNATIONAL</strong> - 2 to 4 weeks</p>
<p>If you want to insure and expedite your package, please add $10 on oders of $100 and under, and $15 for orders above $100 if your are in the <strong>US</strong> or <strong>Canada</strong>. For <strong>international</strong> orders please add $30.</p>
<h3>miniSWARM + battery + case perk</h3>
<p>This perk is the perfect project companion. It comes with a board, a 850mAh LiPo battery and a small enclosure to house the two. Small components will comfortably fit inside (LEDs, switches, sensors). For added fun send us a graphic and we'll print it on the case label.</p>

*Sorry for the shakey camera ^_^!
miniSWARM in the news:

The miniSWARM is...
A smart choice: The miniSWARM is a versatile USB stick-sized wireless Arduino development board. It’s as powerful as the Arduino Mega and has the wireless capabilities of an XBee radio, but we’ve made it a fraction of the cost of an Arduino + radio shield - cheap enough to leave in any project.
A wireless powerhouse: We’ve ported Atmel’s LightWeight Mesh library to Arduino, and made it dead simple to form and manage a network. We took the fuss out of communication diagnostics by integrating range testing features transparently into the library. On top of that, we are developing over-the-air programming (also built into the library) that allows the miniSWARM to be programmed wirelessly. You’ll never need to pop it out of your circuit for a software update!

For Arduino and more: Out of the box miniSWARM uses the Arduino platform for software development and programming and supports the standard libraries (digital i/o, analog, pwm, serial, I2C etc.). However, we’ve added an (optional) external antenna connector, ICSP and JTAG support for advanced users who want to work with a different IDE or use Atmel’s BitCloud ZigBee Pro API.
A complete package: miniSWARM doesn’t require any additional hardware or shields, not even a USB cable. Just plug the USB edge connector into your PC and upload your sketch. There is a standard LiPo battery connector and charger on-board for providing power to your miniSWARM and application circuit.
Open source: We proudly support the open-source hardware and software community. Once the campaign is complete all of the documentation, PCB design files and source code will be made available on our Wiki.
Technical Details
The miniSWARM uses Atmel's ATmega128RFA1 microcontroller which features a built-in 802.15.4 RF transceiver. The complete hardware and software specifications are here, or read the PDF spec sheet by clicking on the image below.


Projects to get you started...
These are some of the apps that will come with the miniSWARM Arduino library.

Want to learn more?
Visit the miniSWARM FAQ to learn more about the platform and what else it can do. Got a question? Post a comment!We need your support!!!

$20,000 goal
We need your support to raise $20,000 for the first production run of the miniSWARM. Our goal is to make miniSWARM affordable enough to leave in your projects without burning a hole in your wallet. We've cleverly designed the board to be minimalistic (although loaded with features), but we can't bring down the cost to our target of $25 without manufacturing hundreds of them.
The funds will be used for:


PCB fabrication of the first batch
Electronic component stock
PCB assembly labour and testing
Firmware programming and functionality testing
Quality control
Packaging and shipping


$35,000 stretch goal SHIELD ADAPTER 
We're not interested in re-inventing the wheel with miniSWARM-only shields. We plan on manufacturing a shield adapter for the miniSWARM so it can be mated with hundreds of standard Arduino shields. If we reach the stretch goal the shield will be available with the release of the miniSWARM in mid-June 2013! In the mean-time, the protoshield can be used.
Distribution
Once the first batch is manufactured and we ship out all the units to our backers, the miniSWARM will be available to distributors for resale.
Shipping
All but one of our perks come with free shipping to the US/Canada. International shipping is $5 for orders under $250, and $10 for oders above $250. Shipping periods are:
CANADA - 5 - 10 days
USA - 1.5 - 2 weeks
INTERNATIONAL - 2 to 4 weeks
If you want to insure and expedite your package, please add $10 on oders of $100 and under, and $15 for orders above $100 if your are in the US or Canada. For international orders please add $30.
miniSWARM + battery + case perk
This perk is the perfect project companion. It comes with a board, a 850mAh LiPo battery and a small enclosure to house the two. Small components will comfortably fit inside (LEDs, switches, sensors). For added fun send us a graphic and we'll print it on the case label.

<p><strong>Who Are We...</strong></p>
<p>Matt is a product development entrepreneur and designer living in the Chinese city of Ningbo.  I live in a city based on product creation and production, and every so often problems come past my desk and need solutions. Randy runs a manfacturing support company with a team of engineers and support staff to design and manufacture products. Together we found the need and solution for solving the Smart Case fit problem for the iPad 2.</p>
<p><strong>The Story…</strong></p>
<p>My friend Randy and I created a neat little insert that makes the iPad 2 fit inside apples newest accessory for the NEW iPad... the Smart Case.  Because the NEW iPad is 3/4's of a millimeter thicker than the iPad 2, the Smart Case fits sloppy and altogether loose.  Our insert takes up the missing space left when you are trying to use it on the iPad 2... simple as that!  We already made the die.. and have product waiting.  SO if you have an iPad 2 and want to use the Smart Case... this simple inexpensive product does the trick.  But don't take my word for it.... better yet.... watch the video and literally take my word for it.</p>
<p><strong>The Product…</strong></p>
<p>The product is a specially designed soft non-woven pad insert that fits in the back of the Smart Case.  When layed in, the pad precisely takes up the space lost from the larger NEW iPad.  So you essentially get a perfect fit on your iPad 2.  Actually, you gain a little cushion when you use the pad, and give you a little added layer of protection.</p>
<p><strong>The Pitch…</strong></p>
<p>So if you have an Ipad 2 and want to use the Smart Case, it’s a no brainer.  We have product waiting on hand… and ready to ship.  So order now, and we will send you out an insert right after the project ends!</p>
<p><strong><strong>Bloggers, want a sample to write about…</strong></strong></p>
<p>If you have an iPad 2, and the new Smart Case, have a way to get the information out to readers, we can send you a sample to review!  Just email us and give us your address.<strong><br/></strong></p>

<h2 align=""center""><span><span>Q &amp; A</span></span></h2>
<p></p>
<p><span><span>1. What is VocalText? FreeButton? and FreePower?</span></span></p>
<p><span>​</span><span><span>Vocaltext is a workgroup that was formed by engineers who devoted their time and effort to change how people communicate to each other in off-grid areas or people who want to reach their one or many friends instantly through voice or text.  We also want to make broadcasting and one on one communication easily accessible for people anywhere within range. We named our core technology Vocaltext and the two devices we are offering are the FreeButton and the FreePower; radio receivers and transmitters that communicate with text or calls through a smartphone app.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span></span></span></p><p>The FreeButton is a small form factor communications device. With a bluetooth connection you would be able to call, text and even share your location off grid. </p>
<div>For adventurers who want an portable battery charger alongside all the communications features of the FreeButton, we have the FreePower, an off grid communications device with a built in battery pack  for ultra long battery life and the ability to top off your mobile devices on the go. </div><p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span><span>2. Why do I need it? What are the applications?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span><span><span>The FreeButton and FreePower are for people who frequently travel to areas with low or no cell connection or people who want want an instant and cost free way to reach their friends through text or calls. With the Free Series, you will be able to communicate with other Free Series devices even if you are off the grid with no cell towers for miles around. The Free Series also allow people to broadcast their conversations, or engage their friends and family in an one to one chat.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. What’s the working principle?</span></span></p>
<p><span>​</span><span><span>The Free Series uses a radio connection to pass text and calls through our dedicated smartphone app. The connection for communicating between the devices are done independently of your phone’s antennas. With the Free Series, it utilizes an inbuilt mic and speaker, so it can communicate independently without a phone. This mean you would be able to stay connected when you are off the gird.</span></span></p>
<p><span>​</span></p>
<p><span>​</span></p>
<p><span><span>4. How much does it cost to use a Free Series device?</span></span></p>
<p><span>​</span><span><span>The Free Series utilizes the built in radio transmitter and receiver in the devices, so none of the communication protocols are done with outside parties. This means free text and calls in most areas you go. </span></span></p>

Our vision is to bring free messaging, calls, location sharing or even broadcasting messages in places
without mobile networks.





The Free Series is the
first add-on accessory to truly supercharge your phone and enables people to
communicate even if there isn’t mobile network available. Whether you are high
up in the Andes or trekking through mountains in rural China, the Free Series
will allow you to communicate with your friends through voice, text and even
share your current location.
Thanks to its dedicated
app, the Free Series utilizes your phones built in GPS locator, allowing you to
plot a map of all your locations in a timeline powered by OpenStreetMaps. Once
your phone gets back on to an internet connection, your messages and timeline
will be safely backed up to the cloud. 


Use Cases
Whether you are camping, jogging or biking. The Free Series can help you stay connected with your friends while allowing you to enjoy the scenic environment around you.









Even though you might be
travelling a country without cost friendly data plan options, you can still
keep in touch and share your location with the Free Series. Whether you're on a crowded street, flea market or at local festival, you'll be able to stay in touch with the people around you.









Whether you are lost in a
megamall when travelling or even on a cruise with no reception,  You will now be able to reach your friends or family members locally without an additional phone plan.

In just a tiny form factor you get amazing connectivity features, alongside GPS tracking through our VocalText app. You will also be able to plot and share your location through OpenStreetMaps.                                 FreePowerWith the FreePower, you get a large capacity battery alongside all the features that you get with the rest of the Free Series. This means the FreePower will last for an extremely long period of time, allowing you to share your location, talk and message your friends to your heart’s content. The FreePower also acts as an portable powerbank for your smartphone. So if your phone is running low on juice, just plug in your FreePower and you’ll be good to go. 










Q & A

1. What is VocalText? FreeButton? and FreePower?
​Vocaltext is a workgroup that was formed by engineers who devoted their time and effort to change how people communicate to each other in off-grid areas or people who want to reach their one or many friends instantly through voice or text.  We also want to make broadcasting and one on one communication easily accessible for people anywhere within range. We named our core technology Vocaltext and the two devices we are offering are the FreeButton and the FreePower; radio receivers and transmitters that communicate with text or calls through a smartphone app.
The FreeButton is a small form factor communications device. With a bluetooth connection you would be able to call, text and even share your location off grid. 
For adventurers who want an portable battery charger alongside all the communications features of the FreeButton, we have the FreePower, an off grid communications device with a built in battery pack  for ultra long battery life and the ability to top off your mobile devices on the go. 

2. Why do I need it? What are the applications?
​The FreeButton and FreePower are for people who frequently travel to areas with low or no cell connection or people who want want an instant and cost free way to reach their friends through text or calls. With the Free Series, you will be able to communicate with other Free Series devices even if you are off the grid with no cell towers for miles around. The Free Series also allow people to broadcast their conversations, or engage their friends and family in an one to one chat.
​
3. What’s the working principle?
​The Free Series uses a radio connection to pass text and calls through our dedicated smartphone app. The connection for communicating between the devices are done independently of your phone’s antennas. With the Free Series, it utilizes an inbuilt mic and speaker, so it can communicate independently without a phone. This mean you would be able to stay connected when you are off the gird.
​
​
4. How much does it cost to use a Free Series device?
​The Free Series utilizes the built in radio transmitter and receiver in the devices, so none of the communication protocols are done with outside parties. This means free text and calls in most areas you go. 
However if you decide to backup your texts or locations to the internet, your internet provider may decide to charge you for roaming or any other fees they might have. 
​
5. How far is the working range?
​The working range for the FreeButton and FreePower is around 3 km.
​
6. Can it work without a smartphone?
​The Free Series with the inbuilt mic and speaker can be operated independently of a smartphone, but for the text messaging and GPS location, it is going to need a Bluetooth connection with a smartphone in order to its full potential.
​
7. What is the cloud storage for?
​The cloud storage can be used to store text and your timeline locations. This means you’ll be able to access your information regardless if you switch devices! 
​
8. Is the cloud storage free of charge?
​Our cloud storage system will be free for the first year.

<p><b>In what format does Tablo save the video/audio stream to
the hard drive? </b>Recorded programs on Tablo are stored in an HLS file that can be
reassembled into a standard MPEG file. </p>
<p><b>How much storage
space will a typical 60 minute HD recording use? </b><br/>A 60 minute program will take approximately 2 Gigs of storage space. <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Will Tablo support NAS (Network Attached
Storage) drives or does it only support USB connected drives?<br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Tablo currently only supports USB 2.0 hard drives of up to 2 terabytes. One
of the reasons why we aren’t currently supporting NAS storage is the wide variation
in network speeds. That being said, this feature is on our roadmap.</span></span></p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">

</span><p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">What is Tablo’s video
quality like? </b><br/>
Most broadcasters distribute signals at 720p or 1080i. Tablo enables you to
select the video quality you want to record in. You can record/playback at the
same quality coming out of your antenna, or choose to save storage space and
record at lower quality.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">When will Android
support become available? <br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our Android app is just a handful of weeks behind development of our iPad

“We are transforming today’s home media experience by delivering a better way to enjoy network and local programming in gorgeous HD, anywhere you happen to be. For TV lovers, Tablo takes away the fear of “cord-cutting” by perfecting the user experience with our tablet app and delivering the DVR functionality everyone knows and loves.” 
– Grant Hall, CEO of NuvyyoStart enjoying your HDTV. Stop paying for Cable.  With the average cable or satellite TV bill hovering around $85 per month, savvy consumers can save over $2,000 over two years by cutting the cord.  Major networks are all broadcasting their full programming content for free, in high definition over the air. This means that virtually everyone in North America has access to amazingly crisp TV shows simply by plugging in an HDTV antenna.Better Quality HD Video that won't tie up your bandwidth.Cable operators compress their TV signals to conserve bandwidth in order to deliver multiple services (phone, TV and internet) over a single connection. Over-the-Air (OTA) HDTV signals received through antennae are uncompressed, delivering an incredibly crisp HD picture far superior to what you’ve been getting from your cable provider.Watch your favorite shows, news and sports, live as they happen.  For the avid sports or TV series fan, the day after airing is too long to wait to see the latest game or episode of their favorite show. Nobody likes having to avoid spoilers at the watercooler following the big game or season finale.Tablo gives cord cutters access to first run broadcast TV in gorgeous High Definition and lets you record, stream and watch it commercial free, for less than the price of Netflix and other Over-The-Top and Internet content providers.
How does Tablo work?The Tablo DVR box collects free Over-The-Air (OTA) broadcast content through a connected HDTV antenna.Hardware set up is super easy:
Plug in your HDTV antenna
Plug in your USB Hard Drive

Connect to your home's wireless router (using an Ethernet cable or WiFi)

Using the Tablo App is even easier:
Download and launch the Tablo app on your tablet
Follow the easy setup wizard
Tablo will scan for all HDTV channels available in your area and download guide data for all programs for the next two weeks.OTA and OTT: Working together.Tablo is designed to work alongside Over-The-Top (OTT) or internet content providers you may already be using, like Hulu and Netflix. Tablo lets you combine their great content with free, live HDTV broadcast programs like hometown news and sports, as well as community and public TV shows, eliminating the need for expensive cable/satellite TV subscriptions and contracts. We’re Canadian, eh!Tablo works with OTA broadcast HDTV in both the US AND in Canada.

the hard drive? Recorded programs on Tablo are stored in an HLS file that can be
reassembled into a standard MPEG file. 
How much storage
space will a typical 60 minute HD recording use? A 60 minute program will take approximately 2 Gigs of storage space. Will Tablo support NAS (Network Attached
Storage) drives or does it only support USB connected drives?Tablo currently only supports USB 2.0 hard drives of up to 2 terabytes. One
of the reasons why we aren’t currently supporting NAS storage is the wide variation
in network speeds. That being said, this feature is on our roadmap.
Can I access the
recordings over my network through the file browser/finder?Tablo files are not currently accessible over the local network.
What is Tablo’s video
quality like? 
Most broadcasters distribute signals at 720p or 1080i. Tablo enables you to
select the video quality you want to record in. You can record/playback at the
same quality coming out of your antenna, or choose to save storage space and
record at lower quality.
When will Android
support become available? Our Android app is just a handful of weeks behind development of our iPad
app so we plan to have Android support out of the gate. The Android native app
will have the same functionality and look-and-feel as our iPad version.
Does Tablo support
cable cards or clear QAM signals?Tablo is focused on providing a DVR to capture High Definition Over-The-Air
broadcast signals so we’re not currently considering adding support for
cablecards or clear QAM.
Does Tablo enable you
to pause live TV? Yes, you can pause live and recorded TV with Tablo. 
Can you skip
commercials with Tablo?Yes, Tablo offers 30 second skip capabilities as well as a 20 second
rewind.Have a question about Tablo? Leave us a comment and we'll get back to you right away.",55.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Technically</strong>, the <strong>MAD USB WATCH</strong> is the first digital watch with a microSD card-slot integrated into a full high speed (2.0) USB flash in a very comfortable silicone strap which makes it practically water resistant. Its frontal digital screen not only displays time and date, but it can also display your total USB Flash capacity as well as how much memory space is available for use. There is no need to connect your USB into a laptop or PC to know if you have enough free memory to save those important documents, pictures or videos into your portable memory. How cool is that?</p>
<p><img alt=""display features for the MAD USB Watch"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.360panovista.com/mad/blue-all-modesx700.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Display Features""/></p>
<p>That was the ""technical"" description of the MAD USB Watch. But there's more to it than just a very practical portable USB with cool display functions. </p>
<p>There are so many issues going around our planet that need our attention and our support, many of which we are not even aware of.  Since I was a kid I dreamed of being a superhero with powers to fly around the planet and help millions of people, but sadly I am not.  </p>
<p><img alt=""Not a hero"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.360panovista.com/mad/herox100.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Not a Hero""/></p>
<p><span><span>Millions of people like me have the will and desire to help others and our planet. So I came up with an innovative way to help accomplish this: </span></span></p>

<h2>How does the MAD USB WATCH help Make A Difference in our needed planet?</h2>
<p>The idea behind The <strong>M.A.D. Watch</strong> is to use this innovative and practical technological tool to help spread the word across the planet creating awareness for all those issues in need of our attention and our collaboration. </p>
<p>There are so many different causes, campaigns, foundations and charities out there that need our awareness and support that we don't even know where to start. It is time we combine technology to help raise awareness and help those organizations currently working to raise funds for their work. </p>

<p>If we reach our goal, your contirbution will provide you with a <strong>Digital Watch, </strong>which is also a <strong>USB Flash drive</strong> with a cool digital display that can be used to store all your personal files or apps. But our hopes are that we can reach way above our minimum goal.</p>
<h3>The Impact of your contribution:</h3>
<p>This campaign needs your support. Your contribution will help spread awareness in adults, teens and kids accross the planet in a fun and usefull way.</p>
<p>This is the <strong>World's First USB Flash</strong> <strong>Watch</strong> used to <strong>Create Awareness,</strong> carrying inside a file with all the necessary information about where and how you can make a difference. </p>
<p><strong>Also, for every MAD USB WATCH you purchase, we will donate 10% to one of your preferred awareness campaign, charity or foundation.</strong> You will, not only be purchasing a very cool and practical USB flash you can carry on your wrist and use to save your important files, but you will be helping spread the word and create awareness globally.</p>

The system uses a GSM SIM card of your choice to enable the use of cell phone SMS text message alerts to one or more phones upon parameters falling out of an acceptable range, that you set. If you use a solar hybrid system it will provide you insight on if your configuration is keeping your application running reliably. Using the AC adapter plug accessory you can even recharge your 12v battery system and optionally use a small solar panel to keep your battery healthy and charged as it is being monitored.  The SiriusM3 can run off of the battery it monitors, reducing site inspection visits and operational costs.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer Application Examples</strong></p>
<p>The SiriusM3 Monitor can help you keep a proactive watch on your valuable off-grid or grid connected systems.  From monitoring the DC Voltage of a fishing, motor, or sailboat battery bank to ensure that the bilge pump is operational (to prevent boats from sinking)  to alerting you of a vacation home's grid going down (to prevent freezing pipes) or sump pump battery failing, the SiirusM3 can prevent damages due to storms or power and battery failures.  When you depend on a battery system to provide you with power to start your boat engine at sea or automatically start your sump pump during a storm, the SiriusM3 Monitor is well worth the small investment.</p>

<p><strong>Industrial Application Examples</strong></p>
<p>There are hundreds of off-grid mission and data critical application devices that provide safety, security and continuous information to centralized systems.  Keeping an eye on your battery bank voltage levels for surveillance, detection systems, traffic signage, etc will save site visits and ensure that reliable power is available for their operation.  If the SiriusM3 saves you one site visit to a remote location it will pay for itself several times over.  Temperature and humidity monitoring can help you keep your refrigeration trucks, freezers, wine cellars, and outdoor off-grid electronics enclosures all within their operational ranges to prevent loss or operational failures.</p>

<p><strong>Product Stage</strong></p>
<p>The SiriusM3 Monitor, accessories and software are in an advanced Prototype Stage and the Indiegogo Campaign will provide the funding for our first large production run.  We've been using a few prototypes and have tested the system's capabilities and communications using a GSM SIM card from within the United States.  This SiriusM3 Monitor Indiegogo Campaign will also provide us with visibility in the interest level of consumers and industrial customers that need proactive monitoring of their off-grid systems.</p>
<h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h3>
<p>1. What voltage battery systems can you use the SiriusM3 Monitor?</p>
<p>Answer:  0-30v battery systems or banks.  That means that primarily 12v and 24v battery systems, most commonly used for off-grid configurations would be monitored.</p>
<p>2.  When will a text message alert be sent to my phone or phone numbers?</p>
<p>Answer:  A text message will be sent to the phone number or phone numbers, that you setup using the laptop software, if DC Voltage, Temperature or Humidity falls out of the acceptable range that you set.  You can have all or any of these three parameters activated to alarm and text message.  They do not have to all be actively monitored. </p>
<p>3. How much power does the SiriusM3 Monitor device use? </p>
<p>Answer:   The SiriusM3 uses a very small amount of power of 20ma continuous.  The device utilizes two rechargeable AAA batteries that is supplied with the system.  We supply the cabling and a DC 12v to DC 5v converter to enable you to optionally continuously operate the SIriusM3 from the battery bank you are monitoring and recharge your battery from an AC adapter plug.  You can also optionally connect a small solar panel to your configuration to keep your battery healthy when it is being used in your application.</p>
<p>4.  Can I use the SiriusM3 without a GSM SIM Card and use of cell phone SMS text alerts?</p>
<p>Answer:  Yes, you can record your values over time and review the associated graphs to optimize your off-grid configuration operations that are dependent on DC Voltage, Temperature and Humidity values.  The SIM card is not included in this offering but are widely available for rates as low as a few dollars per month from companies like Ting at <a href=""https://zq8o9e52opf.ting.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://zq8o9e52opf.ting.com</a>.</p>
<p>5.  What will the SiriusM3 Monitor be priced at for it's MSRP (Retail Price)?</p>
<p>Answer:  MSRP will be $ 195 but Indiegogo supporters and volume wholesale reselling partners will be offered highly discounted prices for the system and optional add-ons.</p>
<p>6. Can I recharge my battery system with the DC to DC converter setup?</p>
<p>Answer:  Yes, we include an AC Adapter plug to enable you to recharge the SiriusM3 rechargeable batteries and your battery that is being monitored through the DC 12v to DC 5v converter.  If your battery's DC voltage gets low you can take it out of use and plug it into an AC wall outlet to recharge the battery bank system.</p>
<p>7. What are the optional add-ons outside of the offered packages?</p>
<p>Answer: </p>
<p>   a.  A special cable for monitoring the 'grid is down' scenario.  If you would like to use the SIriusM3 to watch the 'grid down' scenario, rather than a battery system's voltage, you will need an additional cable for an additional small charge.</p>
<p>   b.  If you are using a 24v battery bank and want to continuously operate your SiriusM3 off of the battery's power you will need a DC 24v to DC 5v converter (rather than the DC 12v to 5v converter that comes with these offered indiegogo packages).  This converter change will be at a small additional cost.</p>
<p>   c.  If you would like the SiriusM3 with GPRS capabilities for a mobile fleet, please notify us and we could plan a custom system enhancement for a minimum quantity of systems.  One example:  If you would like to use the SiriusM3 Monitor to watch the Temperature and Humidity values of your refrigeration trucks or auxiliary power along with having google mobile tracking of that truck's location on an online google map.</p>
<p>8.  If we are outside the United States and Canada, can we resell the system?</p>
<p>Answer:  Yes, please contact us about being a global reseller outside of North America.</p>
<p>9.  Do you have enhancements planned for the SiriusM3 Monitor? </p>
<p>Answer  Yes, we would like to add GPRS capabilities for mobile asset tracking but that will be planned at a future time, following a successful Indiegogo Campaign.</p>
<p>10.  Can the Graphs be customized?</p>
<p>Answer:  Yes, the graphing software enables you to customized your output via the supplied laptop PC software for specific timeframes of your deployment and for specific data parameters.</p>
<p>11. If our SiriusM3 alarm goes off due to a parameter falling out of an acceptable range, how do you reset it? </p>
<p>Answer:  You can setup the system to reset itself after sending the text message and sounding the audio alarm.  As an example; if you set the system to check on the temperature every hour and the temperature alarm is triggered.  It will then stop after a set number of seconds and retest the temperature value after one hour.  This allows for an ongoing longterm remote operation without visiting an off-grid site for alarm resets. </p>
<p>12. If I am from a large reseller and want to request larger discounts for larger quantity commitments or customized packages would this be available?</p>
<p>Answer:  Yes, please contact us for customized offerings and project enhancements.  The QTY 5 and 10 Indiegogo packages offered are a reseller minimum order quantities for this campaign and for future orders.  If one selected package is purchased and you support our project, the reduced price and minimum quantity purchase is reserved for that North American reseller.  Larger distributors can request a 50 unit secret perk.</p>

We have two more improvements and claims not disclosed in the original filing that we are looking to include in the next round.</p><h4 class=""style5""><br/></h4><h4 class=""style5"">FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h4><p><b>How does the DashCrab Duet move in 6 directions?</b><br/>The arm and the slide have tempered steel springs. The arms expand when stretched and then retract, creating a squeezing effect and securing the phone.</p><p><b>Will it work with my case?</b><br/><br/>Absolutely. The size, shape, and groves of the arms have been engineered to work with most all Smartphones on the market today. Includes a non-slip rubberized material to keep your phone secure and safe.<br/><br/><b>Will the suction cup damage my dash?</b><br/><br/>After  years of testing and looking for the perfect solution, we identified a manufacture that specializes in Silicon and we will contract them for our pad. That being said, they are the experts and designed the cup and materials to be super safe and friendly. They provided TY with weather test results that show how well it works in extreme heat and cold situations.<br/><b><br/>Can the mount be used on any surface?</b><br/><br/>As long as there is a flat-like surface that is clean, the mount will work just fine. The locking mechanism was designed with a deep chamber that creates a vacuum seal when locked. Thus, as long as the attaching surface is hard and clean, it will work.<br/><b><br/>Can the mount be used for GPS or other Devices?</b><br/><br/>There are some limits on what you can use. Many GPS devices are ""Deep"" or ""Thick"" and the arms of the DashCrab Duet is an inch wide. As you can see from the image, the Duet can hold unusual items. The DashCrab FX on the other hand has a wider and deeper grasps and that allows you to hold silly things such as Tennis Ball Cans, etc.<br/></p><p><b>MORE ABOUT US AND YOUR RISKS</b><br/></p><p>Rest assured that when the funding goal is reached, we are confident and the new packaging will be designed and manufactured and all contributors will receive the units. One of our team members has years experience in manufacturing and packaging.<br/><br/>The true risks is whether the new packaging designs meet our expectations. The contributors vote is very important. It is possible the new packaging will not be accepted by retail. However, this will not effect the contributors for we will still ship at the end of the campaign.<br/><br/>Packaging is like an art, it's very subjective and can be perceived on any side of the like, dislike spectrum. <br/><br/>We figure that by using 99designs and having you (our contributors) vote on the packaging, we can find the best packaging.<br/><br/>When creating something from scratch and bringing it through fruition, the rewards can be overwhelming.<br/><br/>In order to break free from the confines of any given packaging firm where new ideas are less frequent, we decided to hit the refresh button and turn to 99designs.com designers to create our new packaging.<br/><br/>The criteria is challenging with so many variables that we feel it's in our best interest to submit the job to as many designers as possible.<br/><br/>The challenge is to design new packaging that is affordable, sturdy, US retail friendly, and can convey the DashCrab Value Propositions accurately.<br/><br/><b>Other challenges:</b><br/><br/>Some of the key objectives that need to be met when designing new packaging for our distribution channels are:<br/><br/>- Protect the product from being damaged.<br/><br/>- Use materials that will not scratch, dent, or tear.<br/><br/>- Ship safely from factory to the retail locations.<br/><br/>- Avoid design flaws such as plastic outer shells that damage easily.<br/><br/>- Design copy and graphics that are simple, yet to the point<br/><br/>- Become EDI compliant including the Master Cartons, Inner Cartons, and Individual Units.<br/><br/>- Use recycled or ROHS and environmentally safe materials when possible<br/><br/>- If using a hang-tag, make sure it's sturdy and does not tear.<br/><br/>- Make sure the printing quality and registration is flawless.<br/><br/>- Insure proper use and design for the QR and UPC Codes<br/><br/>Other risks is that we fail to secure the patents or claims granted. We have teamed up with a powerful patent attorney with years of experience and she is confident that we can get our claims issued.<br/><br/>*If we are unable to get the patents granted, it will ""NOT"" effect delivery, production, or business moving forward so all contributors will still get their rewards.</p><p>How we enjoy the Dash Crabs....</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/494702/files/20140408230804-dashcrab_Remote.jpg?1397023684"" src="""" style=""width: 402.507px; height: 289px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/494703/files/20140408230833-DashCrab_Washing_Dishes.jpg?1397023713"" src="""" style=""width: 401.452px; height: 294px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/494704/files/20140408230909-DashCrab_Night_Stand_Clock.jpg?1397023749"" src="""" style=""width: 401.517px; height: 319px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/494705/files/20140408231011-IMG_0064_copy.jpg?1397023811"" src="""" style=""width: 400.5px; height: 267px;""/></p>As you can see, the Universal Mount works great with:<br/>Apple iPhone, Android, Samsung Note, Samsung Galaxy, S5, HTC One, HTC M8, Motorola Droid, RAZR MAXX, iPod, iPhone 5, 5s, 5c, and most smart phones.<br/><br/><p></p><em><strong>Referral Contest, Win a Free DashCrab Duet</strong></em>

Benefits of having USA distribution: 
Fast shipping directly from US
Full customer service support and quick warranty services
Help support USA distributors, workers, and families
Create new US friendly packaging from 99designs
QUESTION: Why don't we have these made in USA? Well, this product was made and designed in Korea and we love it. As a patent holder, we feel it would be wrong to knock it off and have copies made in USA. Instead, we want to promote, support, and distribute the DashCrab in USA. We are small family owned businesses that feel strongly that the DashCrab deserves to become a top selling product.OUR MISSION WITH THE FUNDS:
The DashCrab Duet is the newest design and we need to go into mass production phase to lower cost.
The DashCrab FX was enhanced with a swing jaw that swivels upward to allow ""One Hand Operation"" and we need to complete patents.

We have two more improvements and claims not disclosed in the original filing that we are looking to include in the next round.FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)How does the DashCrab Duet move in 6 directions?The arm and the slide have tempered steel springs. The arms expand when stretched and then retract, creating a squeezing effect and securing the phone.Will it work with my case?Absolutely. The size, shape, and groves of the arms have been engineered to work with most all Smartphones on the market today. Includes a non-slip rubberized material to keep your phone secure and safe.Will the suction cup damage my dash?After  years of testing and looking for the perfect solution, we identified a manufacture that specializes in Silicon and we will contract them for our pad. That being said, they are the experts and designed the cup and materials to be super safe and friendly. They provided TY with weather test results that show how well it works in extreme heat and cold situations.Can the mount be used on any surface?As long as there is a flat-like surface that is clean, the mount will work just fine. The locking mechanism was designed with a deep chamber that creates a vacuum seal when locked. Thus, as long as the attaching surface is hard and clean, it will work.Can the mount be used for GPS or other Devices?There are some limits on what you can use. Many GPS devices are ""Deep"" or ""Thick"" and the arms of the DashCrab Duet is an inch wide. As you can see from the image, the Duet can hold unusual items. The DashCrab FX on the other hand has a wider and deeper grasps and that allows you to hold silly things such as Tennis Ball Cans, etc.MORE ABOUT US AND YOUR RISKSRest assured that when the funding goal is reached, we are confident and the new packaging will be designed and manufactured and all contributors will receive the units. One of our team members has years experience in manufacturing and packaging.The true risks is whether the new packaging designs meet our expectations. The contributors vote is very important. It is possible the new packaging will not be accepted by retail. However, this will not effect the contributors for we will still ship at the end of the campaign.Packaging is like an art, it's very subjective and can be perceived on any side of the like, dislike spectrum. We figure that by using 99designs and having you (our contributors) vote on the packaging, we can find the best packaging.When creating something from scratch and bringing it through fruition, the rewards can be overwhelming.In order to break free from the confines of any given packaging firm where new ideas are less frequent, we decided to hit the refresh button and turn to 99designs.com designers to create our new packaging.The criteria is challenging with so many variables that we feel it's in our best interest to submit the job to as many designers as possible.The challenge is to design new packaging that is affordable, sturdy, US retail friendly, and can convey the DashCrab Value Propositions accurately.Other challenges:Some of the key objectives that need to be met when designing new packaging for our distribution channels are:- Protect the product from being damaged.- Use materials that will not scratch, dent, or tear.- Ship safely from factory to the retail locations.- Avoid design flaws such as plastic outer shells that damage easily.- Design copy and graphics that are simple, yet to the point- Become EDI compliant including the Master Cartons, Inner Cartons, and Individual Units.- Use recycled or ROHS and environmentally safe materials when possible- If using a hang-tag, make sure it's sturdy and does not tear.- Make sure the printing quality and registration is flawless.- Insure proper use and design for the QR and UPC CodesOther risks is that we fail to secure the patents or claims granted. We have teamed up with a powerful patent attorney with years of experience and she is confident that we can get our claims issued.*If we are unable to get the patents granted, it will ""NOT"" effect delivery, production, or business moving forward so all contributors will still get their rewards.How we enjoy the Dash Crabs....As you can see, the Universal Mount works great with:Apple iPhone, Android, Samsung Note, Samsung Galaxy, S5, HTC One, HTC M8, Motorola Droid, RAZR MAXX, iPod, iPhone 5, 5s, 5c, and most smart phones.Referral Contest, Win a Free DashCrab Duet

All you have to do is go to our campaign homepage, grab a unique URL in the “Share this Campaign” field and get the word out as best you can.     There will be two winners: one for most total referrals to the site, and one for most overall contributions dollars referred in (min $20).  Anytime anyone clicks your unique link to get to our page, Indiegogo tracks that activity and “credits” you with the referral.  I can then see who has generated the most traffic to the site.

Click, then grab your unique link to share!  FYI, using the “Share” tools on the homepage works as well, as it automatically ties you to your post on Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus or Email.QUESTION: I see that the Dash Crab is already on the market.ANSWER: Not directly in the USA. The Dash Crab FX is brand new design and the Dash Crab Duet is exclusive and patented. Both offer the ""One Hand Operation"" where as the original Dash Crab and Dash Crab 2 was a two hand model and sold under different brands. We ODM/OEM for other customers. Q: We see the DashCrab on eBay and Amazon, are they the same as what you see here?A: Yes the factory sells to Asian distributors in a plastic packaging that is made for Asian markets. We need your support to become a distributor in the USA and manufacture USA packaging.",19.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, my name is Jan. I have a background selling software packages to both small and large business, but my true passion is music. I have many ideas for technology in this field, and would love to share this one.</p>
<p>Like me, you will own a music dock somewhere in your home or workplace. You may also own an android phone, like the Samsung Galaxy or Note, which holds your current music store. Can you connect your smart phone to utilise your dock with the full remote and charging capabilty using one cable? No, we believe not.</p>
<p>Using our Xiom brand, we have created such a cable by hand, and as you can see from our video and pictures it also looks sleek and tidy. You will also notice the different colours on the cable, this indicates different dock compatibilities which can be changed by touching the touch sensitive front of the cable.</p>
<p>We have spent many hours and spent a reasonable amount of funds to develop our cable to its current state, which works! To get this cable to full production using the many protocols on thousands of different docks we require your kind backing for final development and legal costs. This cable involves plastics, software and electronics, all have been sourced we just need to pay for the final development and production. The money will also enable further development of the cable for other Android devices.</p>
<p>This cable will be developed in the United States.</p>
<p>This project is obviously complicated technology for a new business, a project normally taken on by the larger companies with R&amp;D departments, so how did we do it? The answer Richard Wileman. He is an expert in automation and electronics, and has consulted, designed and developed new and innovative products for various large organizations. He has also provided advice regarding airport access control systems. Richard is a forward thinking, innovative design engineer, and is the reason why you can have faith in the capability of this cable. The other members of the team are Mike and Derek, both qualified accountants, so hopefully the figures will add up!</p>
<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>
<p>The Sam-ple cable provides the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the existing dock remote control to play,pause and change track</li>
<li>touch sensitive button on cable to change settings to suit different docking devices</li>
<li>charging facility for your smart phone (dock dependent)</li>
<li>audio through micro USB</li>
<li>Potential Jelly Bean compatibility with other handsets</li>
<li>firmware upgradeable.</li>
</ul>
<p>This cable will allow full features to Samsung Galaxy S2, S3 and Note running Ice Cream Sandwich. It will allow the same features for the S1 excluding the remote control, which is pending.</p>
<p>We evaluated the possibility of using Bluetooth for our product but decided against it for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has already been implemented by other developers and we don’t want to be “just another one”</li>
<li>Smart phones use enough battery power as it is. Why not have the ability to charge while playing rather than running your battery down even more?</li>
<li>You can use apps already available in the Google store to use your phone as a media server when docked – for example changing tracks from a web interface on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p>The more funds we raise the more features and compatibilities we can add such as other brands and functionality, we thank you for your support in advance.</p>

<p>MicroUPS is a new device for microcomputers like Raspberry, CubieBoard or BeagleBone that functions not only as a UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) but as an ATX Style Power Switch.</p><p>
First and foremost, MicroUPS provides safety for your operating system and your valuable data. What’s more, it enables you to safely turn your operating system on and off without logging in, or plugging a wire - just by pressing a button.<br/></p>
<p>MicroUPS also has 4 LEDs which can be used to indicate the status of the
operating system or the status of the applications running on that
system. The LEDs can be turned on and off with binary command
provided by the MicroUPS software. Alternatively, they can be controlled
from the user application by writing directly to the MicroUPS daemon via
local socket which the daemon is listening on</p>
<p>Using MicroUPS you can work with your microcomputer with greater freedom, similar to a laptop. You can start it on battery power, plug it in to an electrical socket, 
unplug it during work, or leave it plugged in to recharge the batteries.<br/>
MicroUPS will charge Li-Ion cells regardless of whether computer is on or not.

<center style=""font-size: x-large; color: red;"">VERY IMPORTANT UPDATE</center><p>By Changing suppliers and ordering large quantities I was able to cut price more than a half. Moreover cases by default are made from clear, transparent plexi, one of perks called ""Fluorescent case"" is the case upgrade to Fluorescent Perspex. If you just need the functionality, then clear case will do. I have also upgraded battery packs to 1500, 3000, 8000 and 16000 mAh<br/>
I'm on a very tight budget now, so please if you like it, back it up.</p>
<br/><h1><center>Project status</center></h1>
<p>MicroUPS is fully working device, the software is written and the cases are designed.<br/>
We now need to test it for CE and FCC safety compliance to make it available for sales.<br/>
Otherwise, we would like to provide custom, specially-made cables to easily connect MicroUPS 
to your microcomputer.</p>

<h3><center>Hardware</center></h3>
<p>The PCB is made using SMD technology. It is compact - just 52 mm x 55 mm. Power output is 5V 1A and the power input socket is the standard microUSB. MicroUPS uses about 480 mA when charging batteries. This means a power supply adapter with 2A power output is more than enough. In fact, 1200mA output power supply adapter was sufficient to power our Raspberry Pi model B (including an active wi-fi module) in all our tests.<br/>
There are two buttons 'ON' and 'OFF', and four LEDs designed to be used by the end user. The fifth LED is dual color (red/green) to indicate the status of the device.<br/>
Device uses 3.3v for the serial data connection, so it works with Raspberry, Beaglebone, or Cubieboard using a serial port. However, you can also connect MicroUPS device by FTDI-TTL cable and use USB port from microcomputer, or through USB hub (see video clip in gallery and updates) - you can still use on-board serial port for a serial console. <br/>The main components of the MicroUPS PCB is a Linear Technology DC to DC converter with battery charger LTC1980EGN. It also has an energy efficient ATmega8A microcontroller to manage the device.

<br/><h3><center>Tested platforms</center></h3>
<p>The following platforms have been tested so far:</p><ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi model B, system Raspbian/Wheezy</li>
<li>BeagleBone Black, system Debian/Wheezy</li>
<li>CubieBoard, system Debian/Wheezy</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p></p><p>Other platforms: </p><p>Cubie Truck, Hummingbird, Banana Pi, Pandaboard, Parallella, pcDuino, UDOO, Arduino will be tested soon.</p><p></p><br/><h3><center>Li-Ion cells</center></h3>
<p>Li-Ion batteries are available in four battery packs.<br/>
Every battery pack has a built-in PCM which ensures your battery never discharges below a safe level. The PCM is set for discharge current 1A, and charge current 0,5A.
<br/>The four cell types are:
</p><ul>1500 mAh - Single Li-Ion cell, Raspberry Pi B runs for about 80 minutes</ul><ul>3000 mAh - Two Li-Ion cells, Raspberry Pi B runs for about 135 minutes</ul><ul>8000 mAh - Four Li-Ion cells, Raspberry Pi B runs for more than 8 hours</ul><ul>16000 mAh - Eight Li-Ion cells, Raspberry Pi B runs for more than 16 hours</ul>
Detail characteristics of each battery pack are available on the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Micro-UPS-for-Raspberry/822177751128904"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook public Fanpage</a> or in the gallery, or on our website <a href=""http://www.microups.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.microups.net</a><p></p>
<br/><h3><center>Software</center></h3>
<p>MicroUPS comes with a software package that consists of: the MicroUPS daemon, configuration files and binaries to manage the daemon. This binary is a command that a user can interact with when controlling daemon or user LEDs.<br/>
MicroUPS software uses a serial data connection to communicate with microcomputer. On Raspberry  you need to comment out the last line in /etc/inittab file, to use /dev/ttyAMA0 serial port, which is otherwise used by Raspbian as a serial console.
<br/>
The daemon configuration file has a few options that control the serial port, battery low level, notifications and logging. The most important option is 'poweroff_timeout' by which you can set how many seconds MicroUPS should provide power to your microcomputer before cutting it off during a power off procedure. In our tests it was set for 15 seconds which was more than enough. </p><p>MicroUPS software will be available as an OpenSource package on GitHub, and our website. For Wheezy and any other platforms we will provide binary packages.<br/></p>
<br/><h3><center>Case</center></h3>
<p>All perks that include MicroUPS case, are made from Perspex clear plexi. To order the Fluorescent one, please include Perk called ""Fluorescent case"". MicroUPS cases are laser cut from high quality Perspex glass, they come in 7 eye catching colors: Helios Yellow, Acid Green, Lava Orange, Mars Red, Neptune Blue (Perspex Fluorescent Colors). Perspex Fluorescent Color sports a vivid, fluorescent edge which appears to glow under ambient light as though having its own light source. </p><p>Cases are available in four types:
</p><ul>
<li>Small case for MicroUPS</li>
<li>Small case for  MicroUPS and Raspberry</li>
<li>Big case for MicroUPS</li>
<li>Big case for MicroUPS and Raspberry</li>

</table><br/></div>","The goal
MicroUPS is a new device for microcomputers like Raspberry, CubieBoard or BeagleBone that functions not only as a UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) but as an ATX Style Power Switch.
First and foremost, MicroUPS provides safety for your operating system and your valuable data. What’s more, it enables you to safely turn your operating system on and off without logging in, or plugging a wire - just by pressing a button.
MicroUPS also has 4 LEDs which can be used to indicate the status of the
operating system or the status of the applications running on that
system. The LEDs can be turned on and off with binary command
provided by the MicroUPS software. Alternatively, they can be controlled
from the user application by writing directly to the MicroUPS daemon via
local socket which the daemon is listening on
Using MicroUPS you can work with your microcomputer with greater freedom, similar to a laptop. You can start it on battery power, plug it in to an electrical socket, 
unplug it during work, or leave it plugged in to recharge the batteries.
MicroUPS will charge Li-Ion cells regardless of whether computer is on or not.
www.microups.net
VERY IMPORTANT UPDATEBy Changing suppliers and ordering large quantities I was able to cut price more than a half. Moreover cases by default are made from clear, transparent plexi, one of perks called ""Fluorescent case"" is the case upgrade to Fluorescent Perspex. If you just need the functionality, then clear case will do. I have also upgraded battery packs to 1500, 3000, 8000 and 16000 mAh
I'm on a very tight budget now, so please if you like it, back it up.
Project status
MicroUPS is fully working device, the software is written and the cases are designed.
We now need to test it for CE and FCC safety compliance to make it available for sales.
Otherwise, we would like to provide custom, specially-made cables to easily connect MicroUPS 
to your microcomputer.
Project description
Hardware
The PCB is made using SMD technology. It is compact - just 52 mm x 55 mm. Power output is 5V 1A and the power input socket is the standard microUSB. MicroUPS uses about 480 mA when charging batteries. This means a power supply adapter with 2A power output is more than enough. In fact, 1200mA output power supply adapter was sufficient to power our Raspberry Pi model B (including an active wi-fi module) in all our tests.
There are two buttons 'ON' and 'OFF', and four LEDs designed to be used by the end user. The fifth LED is dual color (red/green) to indicate the status of the device.
Device uses 3.3v for the serial data connection, so it works with Raspberry, Beaglebone, or Cubieboard using a serial port. However, you can also connect MicroUPS device by FTDI-TTL cable and use USB port from microcomputer, or through USB hub (see video clip in gallery and updates) - you can still use on-board serial port for a serial console. The main components of the MicroUPS PCB is a Linear Technology DC to DC converter with battery charger LTC1980EGN. It also has an energy efficient ATmega8A microcontroller to manage the device.

Tested platforms
The following platforms have been tested so far:
Raspberry Pi model B, system Raspbian/Wheezy
BeagleBone Black, system Debian/Wheezy
CubieBoard, system Debian/Wheezy

Other platforms: Cubie Truck, Hummingbird, Banana Pi, Pandaboard, Parallella, pcDuino, UDOO, Arduino will be tested soon.Li-Ion cells
Li-Ion batteries are available in four battery packs.
Every battery pack has a built-in PCM which ensures your battery never discharges below a safe level. The PCM is set for discharge current 1A, and charge current 0,5A.
The four cell types are:
1500 mAh - Single Li-Ion cell, Raspberry Pi B runs for about 80 minutes3000 mAh - Two Li-Ion cells, Raspberry Pi B runs for about 135 minutes8000 mAh - Four Li-Ion cells, Raspberry Pi B runs for more than 8 hours16000 mAh - Eight Li-Ion cells, Raspberry Pi B runs for more than 16 hours
Detail characteristics of each battery pack are available on the Facebook public Fanpage or in the gallery, or on our website www.microups.net
Software
MicroUPS comes with a software package that consists of: the MicroUPS daemon, configuration files and binaries to manage the daemon. This binary is a command that a user can interact with when controlling daemon or user LEDs.
MicroUPS software uses a serial data connection to communicate with microcomputer. On Raspberry  you need to comment out the last line in /etc/inittab file, to use /dev/ttyAMA0 serial port, which is otherwise used by Raspbian as a serial console.

The daemon configuration file has a few options that control the serial port, battery low level, notifications and logging. The most important option is 'poweroff_timeout' by which you can set how many seconds MicroUPS should provide power to your microcomputer before cutting it off during a power off procedure. In our tests it was set for 15 seconds which was more than enough. MicroUPS software will be available as an OpenSource package on GitHub, and our website. For Wheezy and any other platforms we will provide binary packages.
Case
All perks that include MicroUPS case, are made from Perspex clear plexi. To order the Fluorescent one, please include Perk called ""Fluorescent case"". MicroUPS cases are laser cut from high quality Perspex glass, they come in 7 eye catching colors: Helios Yellow, Acid Green, Lava Orange, Mars Red, Neptune Blue (Perspex Fluorescent Colors). Perspex Fluorescent Color sports a vivid, fluorescent edge which appears to glow under ambient light as though having its own light source. Cases are available in four types:

Small case for MicroUPS
Small case for  MicroUPS and Raspberry
Big case for MicroUPS
Big case for MicroUPS and Raspberry
For a special request cases are modified to hold Pi Camera, either inside the case, or on separate stand outside the case.

<p>Adnonify is a simple plug &amp; play network device that will enable you to anonimize your surfing behaviour, avoid you being tracked by media/advertising companies and remove all intrusive advertising without any changes to your computer or network configuration.</p>
<p>We decided to launch this project to contribute something back to the community which will enable people without the technical know-how to access information freely and without any government control, filtering, censorship, tracking and intrusive advertising.</p>
<p>Over the years we have seen privacy laws erode and become less important:</p>

<li>Governments tracking every website your surf and storing this information on you.</li>

<li>Censorship by ISP's, Media companies, Governments</li>

<li>Limits on information access depending on which location you are</li>
<li>Bandwith throttling for certain protocolls (P2P, Torrents, ...)</li>
<li>Companies storing information about you without your knowledge or conscent<br/><br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is this so important to us?</p>
<p>Growing up with the internet as an engineers we have seen the technical aspects of technology change for the worse. Innovation is spurred by media companies and certain governments who push for tracking systems, cookies, intrusive javascripts that pull cookies from other sites you have visited and collecting all this information on your in huge databases.</p>

<p>We have been working on the sofware fulltime for several weeks now and its currently being tested, debugged and improved. Powering the Adnonify will be a custom-written Peer-2-Peer decentralized, encrypted VPN software to hide your location, block advertising and trackers. The VPN network will run on standard HTTPS port 443 making the traffic indistinguisible from standard HTTPS websites like your bank or email account making it impossible for ISP's to block or tamper or throttle the Adnonify traffic. The adnonify will allow you to chose the country or jurisdiction where your traffic/connection is terminated onto the internet, allowing you to bypass government/geographic restrictions and hide your location.</p>
<p>Keeping in line with aproximate manufacture cost and development cost we have calculated that to make this feasable we would need to order 1 000 pieces of the Adnonify to make this a successtory, however we will be able to fill demand for more devices if we surpass our goal.</p>

EasyMount: An easy, seamless and invisible mount for your mobile devices. [DEUTSCH]



 Hi, we were looking for a simple mounting solution for mobile devices. As we found only clunky mounting solutions we started to develop EasyMount.
 EasyMount is a simple nice looking mount for almost any mobile device. The special mounting techniques offer you a seamless, invisible mount.After 2 years of testing in different cars and with different mobile phones we are able to offer you a fully developed product.And the best: The installation is very easy. Just put EasyMount in a seam of your dashboard. 
Various mobile phones can be mounted on EasyMount. Therefore only ONE holder is required for all you mobile devices.When changing a vehicle EasyMount can be easily disassembled and assembled.
 NO gluing, NO drilling, NO suction cap.
 Early bird supporter takes part in the draw for one Samsung Galaxy  Tab 2.

The mobile device can be mounted horizontal, vertical or at any angle.


How it works: 
 Easymount consists of two parts.
 1. EasyMount-holder:
The holder is made of brushed stainless steel. There are no weak plastic parts which can break.

 EasyMount holder guarantees a long lifetime, magnets and  rubber bumpers ensure  high holding force.
 
 By applying the mobile device on the holder the magnets are pulling the mobile device onto the rubber bumpers. The rubber bumpers assure a good grip and there is no slipping of the mobile device.   



2.  EasyMount-Thinplate

This is a special very thin (0,2mm) metal sheet with a high content of ferrite. This assures a high resulting magnetic force. The Thinplate can be mounted inside of the mobile cover. 
If you have a thick cover you could install two Thinplates and double the holding force. If necessary, Thinplate could be easily adjusted to any size by using common scissors.


Installing the Thinplate
  Mobile devices with removable battery cover   (for example: Samsung):
The Thinplate is thin enough to fit inside the battery cover.

   Mobile devices with phone case (for example: I-Phone):
The Thinplate is thin enough to fit inside the phone case.


Is your car Easymount ready?
 With a plastic card you can easily check if EasyMount can be installed in your car.
1.  Look for a seam in your dashboard
2.  If you are not able to push the plastic card 1cm in the dashboard, try to look for another seam that may be suitable.
3.  If it is possible to push the plastic card 1cm in the seam your car is ready for EasyMount.
4. You can push now the EasyMount-holder into the seam like you did before with the plastic card.

 Note: older cars often have large gaps in there seams.  A transparent plastic sheet is enclosed in the shipment for filling these gaps. For the very big gaps you can use several plastic sheets to assure the proper grip of the holder in the dashboard. The plastic sheet can be resized with a scissors if necessary.  
 Safety   Note: EasyMount is strong enough to hold any mobile device.Due to the special design of the mount we achieved a holding force up to 1 kg (force measured parallel to the surface area*). Nevertheless we do not recommend mounting big (>6” screen) and heavy (>300g) devices on the EasyMount.  *The test method and the test results are available on request. Please note that the holding force is depending on the thickness of the case or the battery cover of the mobile device.

  Content of delivery:


 EasyMount-holder


 2 piece  plastic plate (3x6cm for  filling   large   gaps in the seam)


4 pieces Thinplate for up to 4 mobile devices (3x6cm,  Thinplate could be easily adjusted to any size by using common scissors) 

installation instruction


 Who are we?
We are a small team  founded by Ulrike Unterlechner  located in Tyrol Austria.

 FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

  Will the magnet damage NFC chips, memory, etc?
 Memory cards are not magnetic data carriers and will therefore not be damaged by static magnetic fields.Cell phones and smart phones contain non-magnetic storage media. Therefore, static magnetic fields near those devices cannot delete data. There are countless covers with magnetic closures or magnetic holders on the market, which also speaks against the notion that magnets can damage these devices.
  My car has large gaps. Can EasyMount be mounted in these large gaps?
Yes.For this purpose,  a transparent plastic sheet is enclosed in the shipment for filling these gaps. The plastic sheet can be resized with a scissors if necessary. The sheet is inserted into the gap. Push the sheet into the gap until the sheet is flush with the edge of the dashboard. The sheet should not be visible any more.

EasyMount: Die einfach zu installierende, rahmenlose Handyhalterung für ihr Auto.  [ENGLISH]


 Hallo,wir haben nach einer einfachen Montage-Lösung für das Handy gesucht. Da wir nur klobige Montage-Lösungen gefunden haben, haben wir damit begonnen, EasyMount zu entwickeln.
 EasyMount ist eine einfache gut aussehende Handy-Halterung für fast jedes mobile Gerät. Die spezielle Montage bietet Ihnen eine rahmenlose unsichtbare Befestigung.Nach 2 Jahren der Erprobung in verschiedenen Autos und mit verschiedenen Handys können wir Ihnen ein ausgereiftes Produkt anbieten. Und das Beste: Die Installation ist sehr einfach. Einfach EasyMount in einen Spalt   am Armaturenbrett stecken und der Halter ist montiert.
Auf EasyMount können verschiedene Handys montiert werden. Das heißt nur mehr EIN Halter für alle Handys.Beim Wechseln eines Fahrzeuges kann EasyMount einfach demontiert bzw. montiert werden.
 Kein Kleben, kein Bohren, kein Saugnapf.
  Frühbucher-Fans nehmen an der Verlosung eines Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 teil.

Das Handy kann horizontal, vertikal oder in einen beliebigen Winkel montiert werden.



Funktion: 

 Easymount   besteht aus zwei Teilen.
 1. EasyMount-Halter:
Der Halter ist aus gebürstetem Edelstahl. Es gibt keine schwachen Kunststoffteile die brechen können.

 EasyMount   garantiert eine lange Lebensdauer.
 
 Die Magneten und die Gummipuffer sorgen für einen guten Halt.



2.  EasyMount-Thinplate

Dies ist ein dünnes (0,2 mm) Blech mit einem hohen Ferritgehalt. Dies gewährleistet eine hohe magnetische Kraft. Die Thinplate kann innerhalb des Handys oder der Handyschale montiert werden.
Wenn Sie eine dickere Abdeckung verwenden, können Sie zwei Thinplates installieren um die Haltekraft zu verdoppeln. Gegebenenfalls können Sie die Thinplate mit einer Schere auf die beliebige Größe zuschneiden. 



Installieren der Thinplate

  Handy mit abnehmbarer Akkudeckel (zum Beispiel: Samsung Handy).
Die Thinplate wird in die Akkuabdeckung gelegt..

  Handy mit Handyschale (zum Beispiel: I-Phone):
Die Thinplate wird in die Handyschale gelegt.


Kann Easymount in Ihrem Auto installiert werden?
 Mit einer Plastikkarte können Sie leicht überprüfen, ob EasyMount in Ihrem Auto installiert werden kann.
1. Suchen Sie nach einem Spalt in Ihrem Armaturenbrett
2. Wenn es nicht möglich ist die Plastikkarte 1cm in diesen Spalt zu schieben, versuchen Sie es bei einem anderen Spalt.
3. Wenn die Plastikkarte 1cm in den Spalt geschoben werden kann, ist Ihr Auto bereit für den Easymount Halter.
4. Sie können jetzt die EasyMount-Halterung, wie zuvor die Plastikkarte in den Spalt schieben.

 Hinweis: Ältere Autos haben oft größerer Spaltmaße. Hierfür ist eine transparente Kunststofffolie beigelegt. Diese Folie wird verwendet, um die größeren Spaltmaße auszugleichen.Die Größe der Folie kann mit einer Schere angepasst werden.
Sicherheitshinweis: EasyMount ist stark genug, um jedes mobile Gerät zu halten.Bei Versuchen konnte eine Haltekraft von 1kg* ermittelt werden. Wir empfehlen jedoch keine mobilen Geräte mit einer Bildschirmdiagonale von größer 6"" bzw. einem maximalen Gewicht von 300g auf EasyMount zu montieren.* Das Prüfverfahren und die Testergebnisse sind auf Anfrage erhältlich.  Bitte beachten Sie, dass die Haltekraft abhängig von der Dicke des Akkudeckels des Handys bzw. der Dicke der Handyhülle ist.

  Lieferumfang:


 EasyMount Halterung

 2 Stk. Plastikfolien (3x6cm, um größere Spaltmaße auszugleichen)

 4 Stk. Thinplate für bis zu 4 mobile Geräte (3x6cm,   Gegebenenfalls können Sie die Thinplate mit einer Schere auf die beliebige Größe zuschneiden)

<h3><span style="""">The Need</span></h3>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><span style="""">As a pioneer in network sensor development we at Esensors often see a need for products before others. Our current vision is that Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth Smart) wireless sensors are likely to become popular for smart buildings and the Internet of Things (IoT). Currently Bluetooth sensor applications are focused mostly on mobile and personal sensing connected to smart phones. However for smart buildings and many IoT applications a fixed location connection to the Internet is needed, specifically a Bluetooth gateway. You can help us develop a link that will make Bluetooth sensors much more accessible on the Internet. </span></p>

<p class=""MsoNoSpacing""></p>
<h3 class=""MsoNoSpacing""><strong><span style="""">Sensors Everywhere</span></strong></h3>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><span style="""">The IoT concept is that sensors, as important IoT elements, are numerous and their use is able to improve the environment in which people live by large and small ways. These sensors must be able to automatically communicate with each other (M2M, machine to machine) on a real time basis and the information read anywhere on the Internet. <span style=""""> </span>In addition to being interoperable without human intervention, implying standards, the sensors themselves, together with the communications, must be low enough in cost to justify their assigned task. Bluetooth, as one of the lowest cost networked wireless offers the most realistic path to this goal. It already is becoming a reality for mobile applications. We now need to do the same for non-mobile applications – smart buildings and smart grid. </span></p>

<p> </p>
<h3 class=""MsoNoSpacing _mce_tagged_br"">Business Model</h3>
<p>We are betting that developers in the smart building area will recognize the advantages of Bluetooth LE for sensors (see white paper) and are willing to back the development of an Internet gateway as a necessary component. We chose a list price of $149 which is several times less than Bluetooth gateways (access points) on the market, few of which are LE. The $35k goal allows a sufficiently high production volume to sell the gateway at this modest price. Since most Bluetooth sensors are low-cost a low gateway price promotes a low system cost, especially for multiple sensor systems. Our gateway will provide data in a standard format. As manufacturers release new Bluetooth sensors (e.g. TI SensorTag), we intend to provide matching API/Apps for a fee ($20) to convert their smartphone data protocol to the Internet standard.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Sensors for the Internet of Things</h3>
<p>Here is a partial list of sensors for IoT---</p>
<ul>
<li>Smart Grid</li>
<li>Remote Controlled Appliances</li>
<li>Intrusion Detection</li>
<li>Patient Monitoring</li>
<li>Air Quality</li>
<li>Water Leakages and flooding</li>
<li>Smart Lighting</li>
</ul><h3>
<br/>Mobile vs Fixed Sensors</h3>
<p>We think some sensors are best suited for mobile applications, such the personal air quality monitor we are selling. Other good examples are heart rate monitors.

------  Now with water/flood sensor option --
The Need
As a pioneer in network sensor development we at Esensors often see a need for products before others. Our current vision is that Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth Smart) wireless sensors are likely to become popular for smart buildings and the Internet of Things (IoT). Currently Bluetooth sensor applications are focused mostly on mobile and personal sensing connected to smart phones. However for smart buildings and many IoT applications a fixed location connection to the Internet is needed, specifically a Bluetooth gateway. You can help us develop a link that will make Bluetooth sensors much more accessible on the Internet. 


Sensors Everywhere
The IoT concept is that sensors, as important IoT elements, are numerous and their use is able to improve the environment in which people live by large and small ways. These sensors must be able to automatically communicate with each other (M2M, machine to machine) on a real time basis and the information read anywhere on the Internet.  In addition to being interoperable without human intervention, implying standards, the sensors themselves, together with the communications, must be low enough in cost to justify their assigned task. Bluetooth, as one of the lowest cost networked wireless offers the most realistic path to this goal. It already is becoming a reality for mobile applications. We now need to do the same for non-mobile applications – smart buildings and smart grid. 
  
 
 The Development Process

Normally we like to design our own circuits and lay out our own printed circuit boards but in this case we will save time (and money) by using an off-the-shelf Linux board (Raspberry Pi or equivalent). The software will translate the cell phone format into Internet format, process the sensor data and display the data on a dashboard similar to that below for a power meter. 
 


  Brief Specifications

 

Bluetooth 4.0 (LE, low energy) compatible
Range: 50 to 200 meters LOS
10/100 Base T Ethernet – path to Internet
Line powered (5v) supply (included)
Case 3.9”x2.5”x1.2”                                                                            
USB (future options such as WiFi)
Linux platform with 500 MB of memory
User and remote programmable
Basic and custom APIs for sensors are provided

 
Business Model
We are betting that developers in the smart building area will recognize the advantages of Bluetooth LE for sensors (see white paper) and are willing to back the development of an Internet gateway as a necessary component. We chose a list price of $149 which is several times less than Bluetooth gateways (access points) on the market, few of which are LE. The $35k goal allows a sufficiently high production volume to sell the gateway at this modest price. Since most Bluetooth sensors are low-cost a low gateway price promotes a low system cost, especially for multiple sensor systems. Our gateway will provide data in a standard format. As manufacturers release new Bluetooth sensors (e.g. TI SensorTag), we intend to provide matching API/Apps for a fee ($20) to convert their smartphone data protocol to the Internet standard.

Sensors for the Internet of Things
Here is a partial list of sensors for IoT---

Smart Grid
Remote Controlled Appliances
Intrusion Detection
Patient Monitoring
Air Quality
Water Leakages and flooding
Smart Lighting

Mobile vs Fixed Sensors
We think some sensors are best suited for mobile applications, such the personal air quality monitor we are selling. Other good examples are heart rate monitors. These are naturals for smart phones and iPads. They could connect to a fixed gateway but do not need to. We are aiming our gateway at sensors which are often not close to a smart phone – the smart building or smart grid.

Wireless Choices for Networked Sensors
Bluetooth LE is a very good choice for networked sensors but not the only one. Here are popular choices:

WiFi (especially low energy)
Bluetooth LE
Mesh (Zigbee, 6LoWPAN, ISA100)
SubGHz (proprietary)
4G cellular
Each has application areas in which they do well and we do not expect a clear winner in the near future. What is needed is a common way of presenting the data to ease interoperation.
Standards
We support standards for sensor data communication and believe that the wider use of wireless sensors is being inhibited by incomplete, narrowly focused standards. When the IoT sensor standard (IEEE/ISO 21451) is released, we will comply with the format. In the meantime we will provide the same format used for our power meters and Websensors which has proven popular.

It can be read directly be a Bluetooth enabled smart phone or, better, by our gateway which is always on-line.  It operates continuously and sends an alarm at a predetermined threshold.


Non-contact power meter – stretch goal of $100k
 Looking into the future we wish to introduce a series of Bluetooth enabled sensors starting with a low-cost, thin non-contact power meter which slips onto 2- and 3-prong plugs. If we receive $100k in funding we expect to have this available by November.

While thanking you, we have already proceed to refund your contributions, not being able to produce the item in such of small quantity at the promised quality. For this reason we have now zero contributors. (we had 10 contributions.) WOW!


THANK YOU ALL 10 CONTRIBUTORS! REALLY!

What was about:


A simple, practical accessory for iPad Pro and Pencil, KLIP is a transparent rubber half ring with a tiny magnet insert.
Use KLIP together with Pencil to attach it to the screen side. Like a real artist.
We made the prototype and share it with friends. They like it.
Our intention was to share the idea hoping to produce it later by finding production capacities.


What we were needed: 

We were intend to raise money for the followings:
1. Refine the prototype
2. Find production capacities
3. Setup distribution


What you were suppose to get:


This campaign had the purpose to see if any interest in such of a product.
Any contribution were considered a helping hand and suppose to be rewarded as defined perks that we now took out not to confuse visitors.
What was the story behind:



1. Function: To enable attachment of Apple pencil to Ipad Pro
2. Condition: No mechanical fixture to iPad screen, no glue, pressure or scratch to Pencil.
3. Overall design: As less as possible noticeable, and no physical impact to both tablet and pencil.
By analysing the iPad screen, we found the existence of magnets with different polarities inside, used for Smart Cover. EVRIKA!
We were testing all kind and sizes of magnets and we found that a round magnet, 0.1 inches (3 millimetres) in diameter, fit perfect on upper right corner side, both in portrait and landscape mode.
So here we are: transparent rubber ring, gently fit around Pencil and simply clip to screen side.
We were test it so much to make sure it is no disturbance to the screen or possible scratch. For this reason, the tiny magnet has also a protective foil over his shiny surface.
NOW...campaign comes to the end, without success, so...thank you all again.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

World’s First, Smartphone-integrated Radar
Module for Cars!




Radarboys is developing a revolutionary, Bluetooth®-enabled radar
module, named iC2, that shows drivers the distances and speeds of other cars
sharing the road with them. Information is displayed on the user’s Android or
iOS-enabled smartphone via a free downloadable app, which triggers both audible
and visual alerts when the driver approaches a potentially hazardous situation.
This allows the driver time to react and return to safety. 

The iC2 device increases the driver’s awareness of his or her
surroundings and improves safety, especially at night and in hazardous driving
conditions.
Radarboys’ iC2 device records all radar data, distances, speeds
and directions, which can help with insurance claims and assist police during
accident investigations. 
Whether you are commuting to work running errands around town,
or on a family road trip, Radarboys iC2 gives you peace of mind and the promise
of safer travels on the road.
Product Highlights:


Easy, suction-cup mount installation
Free, easy-to-use smartphone app (Android/iOS)
Stylish colors
Great design
Use globally


Our motivation and beliefs
Radarboys iC2 is more than a great tech
gadget. We believe it will help improve driver safety and save lives. Each
year, there are more than five million traffic accidents in the U.S. alone, and
more than 30,000 of these incidents involve a fatality.
At Radarboys, we are passionate about
creating life-saving technologies that are affordable, easy to use, reliable,
and built with the world's best materials and components.
Why we need funds
Today we have developed several a few
working prototypes of our iC2 module, but we still need funds to improve some
of the firmware before putting the product into mass production.
Proposed Schedule:



1st month – Finalize electronics
optimization and prototype testing of the iOS & Andriod phone app,


2nd month – Development/testing of beta
versions.


3rd month – Final product testing and
certification.


4th month – Begin mass production.


5th month – Delivery of Radarboys iC2 to
you, our backers.



The proposed schedule outlined above is
set with a reserve, because we do not want to let our backers down or cause
unnecessary delays.
We expect to launch Radarboys iC2 into
mass production and our backers will be able to get new device much earlier and
cheaper than those who will want to buy it in future.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

<ul>
<li>All cables are MFI certified and will be compatible with all Apple devices. </li>
<li>Stack is really the USB Apple should have made. Its great for the car (where you really DO only have 1 port), limited USB computers and anything else you can think of. All Stack chargers come with a FREE Car charger. Because most of us already have the wall charger, and you only need one now! </li>
<li>My campaign is important to me because I'm stuck in the heart of Oil Town, Texas. Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to escape my seemingly inevitable future in the Oil Field. Its not a bad gig! 70,000 a year, starting with no school. But that's not the life I want for myself, I want to change the world! </li>
<li>If successful, you will all get a piece of history! I want every single new iPhone Apple to ship with this Stack Cable! With proven sales, this is more than possible! </li>
<li>If the campaign is unsuccessful, your money will be given back!</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>I need a minimum of $5,000 for the first round of manufacturing. That's why I have chosen the Fixed-Limit goal. If I raised 4,000 dollars, I wouldn't have anything to do with the money, so it will all go back to you. </li>
<li>If I DO reach my goal however, you'll get your order of Stack Chargers just in time for Christmas! Plus a free car charger! I will keep you updated on ever single thing I'm doing AND you'll be able to charge up to 4 devices with one USB port! You can charge you iPhone, iPod, a friends iPhone and also use your mouse/keyboard all at once! This is the USB Apple should have made. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This project will change the world of iThings. If successful, I plan to license the Stack design to Apple, or another iPhone charger manufacturer, so that all future iCables will be made with the exact design of stack. All thanks to you!</li>
<li>I know I look 16, but I'm actually 20. (still young, I know) but I'm a driven individual who refuses to be average and I'm confident I can bring this product to life. </li>
<li>You can follow Stack whether you donate or not at- <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/StackUSB"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/StackUSB</a> - There you will get more updates than any other project has ever posted, and you MAY get some FREE stuff.

<p>I decided on this 17x17cm size with (only) 8x8 LED ( spaced 2cm apart) for 3 reasons: </p>
<p>1) large enough to make a cool wearable display ( like on a Tshirt)</p>
<p>2) only 64 LEDs so power consumption stays somewhat reasonable ( 5V, &lt;4A max per panel) so battery powering is no problem.</p>
<p>3) 8x8 so it is directly compatible to existing Neopixel Arduino( or other) Matrix drivers ( just larger and flexible panel)</p>

<p>Around 40% of the world population has an internet connection today. In 1995, it was less than 1%.The number of internet users has increased tenfold from 1999 to 2013. The first billion was reached in 2005. The second billion in 2010. The third billion will be reached by the end of 2014. </p>

<p></p>
<p>The unstoppable demand for information in motion with a click of the mouse or touch on a smart device is consuming the world's energy supplies at a staggering rate. While the world has turned its attention to green or clean energy, the online digital industry is hiding a dirty secret, and no authority in the world is taking the lead in bringing the industry to account.</p>
<p><strong>Power is needed to keep the internet going at break neck speed around the clock from every corner of the globe.</strong><br/></p>
<p>The virtual world and the cloud is light years from being green or clean. There are more than 3 million data centres around the world as physical infrastructures such as power stations, electricity grids, buildings stacked with back-up generators and lead-acid batteries, which consumes 30 billion watts or electricity per year. This is equivalent to 30 nuclear power plants.</p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><h3>Why is there such demand for power on the internet?</h3>
<p>With our lives increasingly online from banking, shopping, dating, travel, entertainment, social interaction, communicating, sharing photos, education, searching for goods and services  etc. our current technology and infrastructure will not cope to sustain the  massive demand into the future. </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>As the online population is racing upwards video streaming and video conferencing is driving internet traffic, how we manage customer usage thresholds, power resources and infrastructure capability is crucial for the digital revolution<strong>. </strong></p>

<p><strong>So what are the challenges?</strong></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>There is no such thing as the 'cloud'. It is not an imaginery white fluffy thing floating in the sky. Online information and data has to be stored somewhere. The internet is a physical thing consuming 2% of the world's energy and emits 260,000 kg of CO2 pollution yearly.</li>
<li>Video streaming and video conferencing is the fastest growth area in internet traffic requiring higher bandwidth as the demand for data streaming increases. </li>
<li>By 2016 smart devices will outnumber the world's population predicted to be 10 billion. </li>
<li>Clogging of the internet or <em><strong>Contention</strong></em> will dramatically increase causing lost time, less productivity and increased costs as the infrastructure to deliver the internet is fixed. </li>
<li>Massive drain on energy resources. Passing streaming data NOT only uses energy; the steamed data itself IS energy. Globally the internet uses 300 billion watts of energy per year. so as the internet consumes more of our energy resources, so will the price of electricity soar.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Used International bandwidth</strong></p>
<p>As you can see in the chart below, international bandwidth availability has soared (""used bandwidth"" refers to the capacity deployed by providers, rather than bandwidth consumed by end users). From 1.4 terabits per second in 2002, it steadily climbed to 6.7 terabits in 2006 and has now reached 92.1 terabits per second. TeleGeography expects that number to hit 606.6 terabits per second in 2018 and 1,103.3 terabits per second in 2020. Jon Brodkin - May 2 2012, 2:40am AUSEST arc technica</p>

<p><strong><strong>So what is the solution to the internet explosion?</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Internet Bandwidth reduction.</strong></p>
<p>The engine room or core of the Internet has become streaming which is commonplace from smartphones, laptops, tablets and other computer devices.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/588829/files/20140519014510-Intrak_logo.jpg?1400489110"" src="""" style=""width: 239px; height: 144px;""/>                        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/588832/files/20140519014542-MVFU_logo.jpg?1400489142"" src="""" style=""width: 180.34px; height: 169px;""/> </strong></p>

<p><strong>With MVFU bandwidth reduction technology achieving up to 80% beyond compression reduction.<br/></strong></p>
<p>This technology is positioned to be very disruptive to the main players on the market such as Skype, YouTube, Sky and Commercial TV channels worldwide who are relying on exsiting compression technology. <br/>The benefit to the environment is a reduction is dirty energy and lowering co2 pollution.</p>

Intrak Australia has also achieved aggressive 80% reduction over and beyond compressed files produced by future compression scheme H265 (HEVC) without compromising quality 
Significant social impact with measured costs benefits on energy, internet infrastructure, productivity, bandwidth reduction
Developed 5 different applications to benefit individual users, government, business and service providers






Did you know the internet uses 300 billions watts of the worlds energy and emits 260,000 kg of CO2 pollution yearly, and uses more energy than the entire global AUTO industry?



Around 40% of the world population has an internet connection today. In 1995, it was less than 1%.The number of internet users has increased tenfold from 1999 to 2013. The first billion was reached in 2005. The second billion in 2010. The third billion will be reached by the end of 2014. 



The unstoppable demand for information in motion with a click of the mouse or touch on a smart device is consuming the world's energy supplies at a staggering rate. While the world has turned its attention to green or clean energy, the online digital industry is hiding a dirty secret, and no authority in the world is taking the lead in bringing the industry to account.
Power is needed to keep the internet going at break neck speed around the clock from every corner of the globe.
The virtual world and the cloud is light years from being green or clean. There are more than 3 million data centres around the world as physical infrastructures such as power stations, electricity grids, buildings stacked with back-up generators and lead-acid batteries, which consumes 30 billion watts or electricity per year. This is equivalent to 30 nuclear power plants.
Why is there such demand for power on the internet?
With our lives increasingly online from banking, shopping, dating, travel, entertainment, social interaction, communicating, sharing photos, education, searching for goods and services  etc. our current technology and infrastructure will not cope to sustain the  massive demand into the future. 



As the online population is racing upwards video streaming and video conferencing is driving internet traffic, how we manage customer usage thresholds, power resources and infrastructure capability is crucial for the digital revolution. 
CONTRIBUTE NOW
So what are the challenges?


There is no such thing as the 'cloud'. It is not an imaginery white fluffy thing floating in the sky. Online information and data has to be stored somewhere. The internet is a physical thing consuming 2% of the world's energy and emits 260,000 kg of CO2 pollution yearly.
Video streaming and video conferencing is the fastest growth area in internet traffic requiring higher bandwidth as the demand for data streaming increases. 
By 2016 smart devices will outnumber the world's population predicted to be 10 billion. 
Clogging of the internet or Contention will dramatically increase causing lost time, less productivity and increased costs as the infrastructure to deliver the internet is fixed. 
Massive drain on energy resources. Passing streaming data NOT only uses energy; the steamed data itself IS energy. Globally the internet uses 300 billion watts of energy per year. so as the internet consumes more of our energy resources, so will the price of electricity soar.



Used International bandwidth
As you can see in the chart below, international bandwidth availability has soared (""used bandwidth"" refers to the capacity deployed by providers, rather than bandwidth consumed by end users). From 1.4 terabits per second in 2002, it steadily climbed to 6.7 terabits in 2006 and has now reached 92.1 terabits per second. TeleGeography expects that number to hit 606.6 terabits per second in 2018 and 1,103.3 terabits per second in 2020. Jon Brodkin - May 2 2012, 2:40am AUSEST arc technica





So what is the solution to the internet explosion?
Internet Bandwidth reduction.
The engine room or core of the Internet has become streaming which is commonplace from smartphones, laptops, tablets and other computer devices.

                         

With MVFU bandwidth reduction technology achieving up to 80% beyond compression reduction.
This technology is positioned to be very disruptive to the main players on the market such as Skype, YouTube, Sky and Commercial TV channels worldwide who are relying on exsiting compression technology. The benefit to the environment is a reduction is dirty energy and lowering co2 pollution.

As smartphones continue to get slimmer and upgrade to larger screens, antenna spaces are getting smaller. That’s why most phones are struggling with reception! By the law of physics, the smaller the antenna volume, the less likely it is to achieve a good performance. EMW connects with your iPhone’s antenna wirelessly and boosts its performance.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/509353/files/20140415004636-HOWITWORKS_EMW-01-01.jpg?1397547996"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>In January 2014 we came out with a WIFI and 3G signal enhancing case which also happens to support LTE for T-Mobile users, and we wanted to take it further by allowing users from other LTE networks to benefit from our technology. </p>
<p>That’s how we started working on AT&amp;T and Verizon LTE networks. The challenge we faced to develop a LINKASE PRØ for AT&amp;T and Verizon LTE networks was that their bands operate at a very low frequency (698MHz ~ 798MHz). The lower the frequency is, the larger the volume is required for the antenna in order to have a good signal. We did countless rounds of designs, prototypes, lab testing, and field testing to verify and backup our solution. </p>
<p>Now we are very happy to say that our<b> LINKASE PRØ LTE</b> can help achieve a boost in signal when you most need it (min. 4dB gain) and and optimise your iPhone battery by 20%!</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/509364/files/20140415004906-titlebars-03.jpg?1397548146"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We conducted numerous field test while developing the technology and we were able to see a 4dB signal gain (lab test report) when the LTE EMW was pulled up. </p><p>Everybody can verify this performance upgrade in 3 ways. The easiest and most immediate way to verify the performance upgrade is via RSRP* in the Field Testing Mode**. You can check the real time RSRP value which is updated every 2 seconds.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/509355/files/20140415004720-FIELDTESTMODE-01-02.jpg?1397548040"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>*RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) is an LTE specific metric that averages the RF power in all of the reference signals in the passband.</p><p>**Field Test Mode is activated by calling *3001#12345#* from your iPhone.  Once Field Test Mode is activated, a numerical value for signal strength appears in the upper left hand corner of the screen (where the signal strength was previously displayed in bars). The closer the number is to zero, the better the reception, so -80 is a stronger signal than -90. Anyone can perform this test on their iPhone, but it should be noted that the results will vary according to each situation. The RSRP value can be located by selecting the “Serving Cell Measurements” menu.</p><p>The other 2 ways to verity the performance upgrades are checking the dB value in Field Test Mode* and doing a speed test*. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/509356/files/20140415004731-FIELDTESTMODE-01-01.jpg?1397548051"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>*Speedtest.net Mobile Speed Test is a downloadable app which can test the current speed of your network. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/509358/files/20140415004756-Machinetest.jpg?1397548076"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

Show us your social network skills!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Boost your LTE signal on your smartphone and say good-bye to frustrating weak signal situations.

We are proud and excited to present LINKASE PRØ LTE - a signal enhancing protective case which dramatically improves your LTE (AT&T & Verizon) signal on your iPhone 5/5s. 




Simply slide out the EMW ELEMENT implemented on the case and enjoy a boost on LTE signal. 

Here are some of the situations LINKASE PRØ LTE would help you:
- On the road, when you need to find the direction of your destination and your map is not loading…
- During a video chat, when you’re talking to your loved ones and the video keeps getting stuck…
- On the go, when you desperately need to download an important file and the speed is too slow…
- On vacation, when you want to share a beautiful sight with your friends and the photo won’t upload…
- Right before a meeting, when your client is expecting that important email and it won’t send…
- And of course, when you drop your phone! 

Just don’t expect it to work when your are in the middle of the dessert or the ocean where there’s no signal to begin with!

The technology behind LINKASE PRØ is called EMW - Electro Magnetic Waveguide. As smartphones continue to get slimmer and upgrade to larger screens, antenna spaces are getting smaller. That’s why most phones are struggling with reception! By the law of physics, the smaller the antenna volume, the less likely it is to achieve a good performance. EMW connects with your iPhone’s antenna wirelessly and boosts its performance.

In January 2014 we came out with a WIFI and 3G signal enhancing case which also happens to support LTE for T-Mobile users, and we wanted to take it further by allowing users from other LTE networks to benefit from our technology. 
That’s how we started working on AT&T and Verizon LTE networks. The challenge we faced to develop a LINKASE PRØ for AT&T and Verizon LTE networks was that their bands operate at a very low frequency (698MHz ~ 798MHz). The lower the frequency is, the larger the volume is required for the antenna in order to have a good signal. We did countless rounds of designs, prototypes, lab testing, and field testing to verify and backup our solution. 
Now we are very happy to say that our LINKASE PRØ LTE can help achieve a boost in signal when you most need it (min. 4dB gain) and and optimise your iPhone battery by 20%!We conducted numerous field test while developing the technology and we were able to see a 4dB signal gain (lab test report) when the LTE EMW was pulled up. Everybody can verify this performance upgrade in 3 ways. The easiest and most immediate way to verify the performance upgrade is via RSRP* in the Field Testing Mode**. You can check the real time RSRP value which is updated every 2 seconds.*RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) is an LTE specific metric that averages the RF power in all of the reference signals in the passband.**Field Test Mode is activated by calling *3001#12345#* from your iPhone.  Once Field Test Mode is activated, a numerical value for signal strength appears in the upper left hand corner of the screen (where the signal strength was previously displayed in bars). The closer the number is to zero, the better the reception, so -80 is a stronger signal than -90. Anyone can perform this test on their iPhone, but it should be noted that the results will vary according to each situation. The RSRP value can be located by selecting the “Serving Cell Measurements” menu.The other 2 ways to verity the performance upgrades are checking the dB value in Field Test Mode* and doing a speed test*. *Speedtest.net Mobile Speed Test is a downloadable app which can test the current speed of your network. 

After extensive field testing we were ready for the ultimate test by applying for a CTIA authorised test lab report. And the results speak for itself! In the official test report we can see at least a 4dB increase in gain from 698MHz to 798MHz. We’re transparent about our signal testing results, so please feel free to download the complete report here.As our EMW is assisting in the iPhone’s antenna effort, it makes power use more efficient and thus providing a longer battery life for users**Saving battery life with EMW becomes more effective when running in lower signal conditions.While we put most of our emphasis on the signal enhancing and battery saving functions, our design team has also been working hard to create a stylish case. It conceals all the technology and provides the users an easy-to-use and long-lasting protective cover. We use shock-resistant polycarbonate —which ensures a tight grip with the iPhone— and a multi-layered custom paint finish —which is highly resistant to scratching and dirt repelling—. LINKASE PRØ LTE looks great with your iPhone 5/5s and feels great on your hand. LINKASE PRØ LTE for iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S Compatible with LTE subscribers from AT&T and Verizon*Length: 4.97in (126mm) / Thickness: 0.4in (10.8mm) / Width: 2.4in (61.2mm) / Weight: 0.86ounces (24.6g)At the moment, we are offering the 2 most classic colours: Coal Black and Frost White.

The Project Remshoot 3.0
    Our project was initially designed to control few digital cameras as Nikon D50, but it can control many other digital cameras (our focus will be on Nikon and Canon DSLR and Coolpix or Powershot compact series) using the PTP standard, everything depends on the specific functions provided by the camera you own. Once connected to the USB port on the camera, with the function of discovery capabilities, Remote Shooter 3.0 knows which commands and properties are available. For limited features as Focus&Release combined with Time Lapse, a stereo jack 2.5 port is available. Just buy a cable suitable for your remote control port specific for your camera.
Our goal is produce a flexible, upgradable and open Camera Control, for appassionate and professional at lower price possible!
 
Main features:

Remote Shoot;
Time Lapse (interval in sec,repeatition);
Shutter Speed Settings;
Aperture Settings;
Iso Settings;
Bracketing on/off;
Shake&Shoot (using your android phone accelerometer);

Wireless firmware Upgrade (many other features on plan)
Li-Po Battery rechargeable from any phone microusb power supply

The app on Android or Windows PC, is released in OpenSource, radically extending the usability of the device.With a language of simple and intuitive controls, you can control your camera.We use Google App Inventor for Android to create the GUI editable by anyone, so it will be easy to implement custom functions so far unthinkable.
If you have no programming skills, you can write a sequence of commands to a text file, click a button on your smartphone and will be read and executed by the application.

What We Need & What You Get
 
Hello guys, we Need €16,500 to make RemShoot 3.0 project become reality!
With your help, we'll raise the €16,500 that we need to:
•Get the boards CE certified – Regrettably, In Italy this is an expensive process for the certification lab to give us the ability to distribute the product.
•Produce the first run of boards – In the past we've been prototyping previous versions through very small but expensive batches of boards.
•Develop and test compatibility over a wide range of Digital Cameras (as many possible, but at the beginning our primary goal will be on Nikon and Canon DSLR or Coolpix and PowerShot compact series) 

Today we plan to develop mainly on: 
Canon EOS 30D,EOS 40D,EOS 60D,EOS 400D,EOS 450D,EOS 500D,EOS 550D, PowerShot SX220 HS
Nikon D50,D60,D70,D90,D300,D700,D5000,D5100,D7000,Coolpix 7900
If you decide to contribute, please specify which digital camera you have.
After the previous versions based on our Pic-Ap-Board, (that hardware was thought for a wide variety of applications, not only for photography),  we're now reached enough knowledge and ready for starting this new project, RemShoot 3.0. But, the only way to make RemShoot 3.0 reasonably priced for everybody, is to do a reasonable volume production run of the boards. So in our budget plan, €16,500 is the minimum amount we need for Certification, assembly and manufacture of the first run of boards, including rechargeable  LI-PO batteries and the self made resin enclosure box.
If you are a fan of Creative Photography and HI-Tech, we toughly recommend the RemShoot 3.0 Limited Edition at €75 each (Italy shipping included; add 15 euro for International shipping).
With this Kit, you'll get a finished product in a resin, original enclosure box, in one of 4 color at your choice (Red, Black, Blue or Yellow), the board fully tested and programmed with the latest firmware available. Each RemShoot 3.0 kit contains  moreover a rechargeable LiPo battery, with it’s dedicated micro USB port for charging, 1 Bluetooth module to wireless interact with the application on Android devices or a PC running Windows S.O, the app RemShoot for Android, (including source code) , the customized Pc Windows tool to easily upgrading via Bluetooth the board.
Last but not least, we plan to make several upgrades and implement other features to enrich RemShoot 3.0 Project, so it’s wireless firmware upgradable from a PC Windows  via Bluetooth. You can free your creativity with RemShoot 3.0

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Thanks for evaluating this campaign!  </p>
<p>My name is Joe Newell, and for over 25 years, I have been passionate about the sport of racquetball.  For the past 4-5 years, I have been developing the <a href=""http://www.RacquetballChallenge.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Racquetball Challenge"">Racquetball Challenge</a> website application.  This is a FREE web application for running racquetball challenge ladders and leagues, finding players, finding clubs, learning how to play, and much more!  Now, <strong>I need your help to raise the funds to have IOS and Android applications built to interface with and enhance this website</strong>.</p>
<p>This website, and the proposed mobile applications are important because they eliminate the fundamental obstacles to growth in the sport:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>No programs at local clubs</strong> - Fully automated racquetball programs (challenge ladders and leagues) for your local club can be created in minutes and maintained with almost no effort!   </li>
<li>
<strong>Can't find anyone to play with</strong> - You can easily find someone to play with, evaluate their skill level and historical statistics, and contact them for a match!</li>
<li>
<span><strong>No-one knows what is going on</strong> - The </span>communications <span>of this website will stimulate competition at your club.  Match results are emailed to all participants which keeps everyone informed and excited about who is winning/losing.  Comments can also be sent to all ladder/league participants when looking for a match, selling a racquet, or whatever else is of interest to the ladder/league members.</span>
</li>
<li><span><strong>Can't find a place to play</strong> - If you are travelling, you can search our extensive database for a place to play, view their website, view their location on Google maps, and call them.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>No one to coach me</strong> - the website has an extensive collection of instructional videos and other media for you to learn how to play, and how to play better.  You can also search and find a coach, often a coach for free!</span></li>
</ol>
<p>You will be able to perform all of the above activities in the new mobile device applications.  How exciting it will be, as soon as you step off the court, to submit your match results, find your next opponent, and contact them for a match after evaluating their stats, all from the convenience of your IOS or Android device.</p>

<p>These applications have been built to remove all obstacles to playing racquetball, and to stop the trend of local clubs re-purposing racquetball courts for other purposes.  I know you are as upset as I am every time you see a racquetball court that now looks something like the picture above. </p>
<p>These applications will have a huge impact on making racquetball the number one racquet sport in the world.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These applications have impact!  Over 32,000 unique visitors came to the website in the past year alone and viewed over 85,000 pages.  That is a lot of racquetball training and local club participation.  With your help, and these applications, we can grow these numbers exponentially and make racquetball the number one racquet sport in the world!</p>

<h2 align=""CENTER"" class=""western"">PRICE REDUCTION - NOW ONLY $20!!!</h2>
<p>A HUGE thanks to everyone who has already purchased a case at the original price of $30! We have been working with our suppliers to reduce the production cost and have managed to reduce our costs drastically. </p>
<p>This means <strong>Coconut cases are now available for just $20! </strong></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Existing Funders:</strong></span></p>
<p>For those who have already purchased at the original price, don't worry. All extra profits from your order will be donated to the charity directly. This means every case purchased at the original price you will fulfill an extra 4 metrics. For example, if you purchased the <strong>BLACK case</strong> this will now have the power to <strong>heal 25 children of worms</strong>.</p>
<p>Thank you for all your support!</p>
<h2 align=""CENTER"" class=""western"">Campaign Update - April 2nd</h2>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has supported the Coconut campaign so far. Your support will help change the lives of many.</p>
<p>We know a few people had issues with choosing which color and design. Please don’t worry, at the end of the campaign we will send out a questionnaire. In this questionnaire you can choose which cause beacon and design you would like.</p>
<p>Once again, thanks for supporting the Coconut movement!</p>
<p>Love,<br/>The Coconut Team</p>

<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: small;"">The idea for Coconut was born at <a href=""http://www.szceit.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SZCEIT</a>, an electronics development and manufacturing firm in Shenzhen, China. The case brand was the combined vision of Ben Dolgin-Gardner, Malcolm Russell and Steve Murray.</span></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: small;"">Having migrated to China due to the lack of opportunity for young designers in the western world, Malcolm and Steve wanted to create a meaningful brand which gives designers the opportunity to use their creativity to make the world a better place. </span></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: small;"">This idea evolved into what you see here today, Coconut, a brand that gives designers and artists worldwide a platform to design for charity.</span></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: small;"">""What we really want to do with this brand is combine great design with charity. It's all about giving designers exposure and raising awareness for global causes."" -Steve Murray</span></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: small;""><span>Our lives have revolved around this project for the past 6 months. We've finalized the case designs, partnered with charities, sourced awesome designs, and now the only part left is YOU!</span></span></p>

<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #333333;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">We recommend cleaning your case with mild soap and water, most stains can be removed using this process.

<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #333333;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">For the Canvas part of the case with a gloss finish, a contact cleaner should work if something more than mild soap and water is needed. The Cause Beacon has a soft touch coating, don't attempt to clean, with anything other than a damp soft cloth as chemicals will likely cause the soft-touch coating to peel.</span></span></span></p>

A HUGE thanks to everyone who has already purchased a case at the original price of $30! We have been working with our suppliers to reduce the production cost and have managed to reduce our costs drastically. 
This means Coconut cases are now available for just $20! 
Existing Funders:
For those who have already purchased at the original price, don't worry. All extra profits from your order will be donated to the charity directly. This means every case purchased at the original price you will fulfill an extra 4 metrics. For example, if you purchased the BLACK case this will now have the power to heal 25 children of worms.
Thank you for all your support!
Campaign Update - April 2nd
Thanks to everyone who has supported the Coconut campaign so far. Your support will help change the lives of many.
We know a few people had issues with choosing which color and design. Please don’t worry, at the end of the campaign we will send out a questionnaire. In this questionnaire you can choose which cause beacon and design you would like.
Once again, thanks for supporting the Coconut movement!
Love,The Coconut Team

AVAILABLE FOR:
iPhone 4(S), iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S3, S4 and Galaxy Note 2
 



Press:

 
Awesome Looks. Awesome Protection. Awesome feeling.
Coconut cases are a fashion product that empowers YOU to make a change. With every purchase of a Coconut case, people in need are provided with services that will enhance their living situations exponentially. Whether it is providing clean water or vaccinations for polio, the money raised will go to a socially conscious cause.
 

Coconut cases empower YOU to make a change.
Each color represents a different cause, for example red for AIDS, pink for polio, blue for clean water etc. When you buy a case, a donation is given to the supporting charity to further their global projects.
For example, buy the black case and through the help of One Day's Wages we can heal 5 children of worms.


How it works.
The case is divided into two parts, the canvas and the cause beacon. 
Canvas
To ensure we have awesome graphics on our cases, we harness the creativity of artists and designers from around the globe. These designers and artists can draw cool graphics or illustrations and simply take a quick snap with their phone and upload to Instagram using the hash tag #cocovote. All submissions have a chance of becoming the next Coconut case graphic.
Here are our first 6 designs, sourced from designers all around the world.





 

Cause Beacon
Each colored beacon is paired with a cause, a charity, and a specific metric. For each beacon purchased, we will fulfill the metric tied to that cause with the help of our charity benefactors. We're giving YOU the power to change the World! 

POVERTY: Black - One Day's Wages 
For the 1.4 billion people living on less than $1.25 a day, basic health care remains out of reach or completely unavailable. The ODW Health Fund seeks to address this lack of access to medical care in the developing world by funding quality projects on the ground. For every black case purchased, One Day's Wages can heal 5 children of worms.
 
WATER: Blue - Canned Water 4 Kids 
30,000 people die every week from unsafe drinking water. For every blue case purchased, Canned Water 4 Kids will be able to provide clean drinking water for 10 people.
 
POLIO: Pink - Global Poverty Project 
Polio is a distant memory in much of the world, thanks to global efforts to vaccinate children everywhere against this debilitating disease. Yet we cannot forget that there is still more to do to wipe out this disease for good. For every pink case purchased, Global Poverty Project will be able to provide 1 polio vaccination.
 
AIDS: Red - Keep a Child Alive

34.2 million people worldwide are living with AIDS and 72% of children in need of HIV treatment are not receiving it. For every red case purchased, Keep a Child Alive can provide 2 days of treatment for someone suffering with AIDS.
 
CHILDREN: Yellow - Soles4Souls

The Haitian earthquake in January 2010 devastated a country that was barely holding itself together in the first place. For every yellow case purchased, Soles4Souls will provide shoes for 2 children in Haiti that so desperately need them.
 
ENVIRONMENT: Green - African Wildlife Foundation

The Mau Forest is suffering. Over the past 20 years more than 25 percent of the forest has been degraded or destroyed, taking a great toll on the rivers and lakes whose water originates there. For every green case purchased, African Wildlife Foundation will plant 2 trees in the Mau Forest to increase its prospects of survival.

Our Story - The Beginning
The idea for Coconut was born at SZCEIT, an electronics development and manufacturing firm in Shenzhen, China. The case brand was the combined vision of Ben Dolgin-Gardner, Malcolm Russell and Steve Murray.
Having migrated to China due to the lack of opportunity for young designers in the western world, Malcolm and Steve wanted to create a meaningful brand which gives designers the opportunity to use their creativity to make the world a better place. 
This idea evolved into what you see here today, Coconut, a brand that gives designers and artists worldwide a platform to design for charity.
""What we really want to do with this brand is combine great design with charity. It's all about giving designers exposure and raising awareness for global causes."" -Steve Murray
Our lives have revolved around this project for the past 6 months. We've finalized the case designs, partnered with charities, sourced awesome designs, and now the only part left is YOU!

What are we going to do with the money?
The money raised here on Indiegogo will go toward building the Coconut brand. It will fund the initial range of products so you can enjoy your Coconut case ASAP. Additional money will go toward marketing efforts to expand our brand.
Manufacturing - We know you want your Coconut case as soon as possible, so we are already working with our manufacturer on production. We have already made the mold for the iPhone 5 case and we need the money to make the molds for a full range fo cases for various phones.
Growth - As we grow, we want to increase our support for global designers and causes. This means regularly releasing new designs, cases, and electronic accessories.

Why are we on Indiegogo?
Distribution - We want to make Coconut products available to as many people as possible. To do this, we need to extend our distribution channels through ecommerce and retail outlets such as RadioShack, Target, Apple Store etc.
Marketing - YOU are the voice of this movement! In order to build momentum, we need you to share Coconut with your friends/family. The easiest way to do that is through social media: POST ON FB, TWEET, & INSTAGRAM A PHOTO!
 
Perk Levels
As a donor, you can receive any of the following perks. You can receive
Coconut Cases, Cause Beacons, or a comination of these perks.
FAQ
If my question isn't answered here, how do I ask?
Just email us - whatsup@coco-email.com.
When will my case be delivered?
iPhone 5 Shipping Date: 05.01.2013
Other Cases Shipping Date: 06.15.2013
We know you want to receive your case ASAP, so we are working hard to get them manufactured and ready to ship as soon as possible.
How do I clean my Coconut case?
We recommend cleaning your case with mild soap and water, most stains can be removed using this process. We do not recommend machine washing as this will have some adverse affects on your case.
For the Canvas part of the case with a gloss finish, a contact cleaner should work if something more than mild soap and water is needed. The Cause Beacon has a soft touch coating, don't attempt to clean, with anything other than a damp soft cloth as chemicals will likely cause the soft-touch coating to peel.
Please keep in mind that we do not warrant our product for finish damages caused by any type of cleaning or attempts at cleaning.
Do your products come with a warranty?
All of our products carry a 1 year warranty against manufacturing defects. If you feel your product has a manufacturing defect, please contact us and we'll look into getting you a replacement.
My case cracked, peeled, scratched or otherwise does not look like it did when I bought it - what do I do?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it. All of our products carry a 1 year warranty against manufacturing defects. If you feel your product has a manufacturing defect, please contact us and we'll look into getting you a replacement.
My Slider Case seems to be stuck on my iPhone, how do I remove it?
The case can be removed by using a latex glove to grip the case and pulling the top portion off from the bottom where the sliding portion meets the top portion. Squeezing the case from the sides will just make it more difficult to remove. It will take quite a pull to come off so it might be a good idea to get assistance. Please contact us if you have any problems.
Is the case waterproof?
Our cases do not provide any protection against water damage.
Are Coconut cases available in retail stores?
Not yet, but they will be soon! Coconut products will be in retail stores in 2013.
What percentage of donations go to the charities?
Each case comes with a metric which is carried out with the purchase of the case. We want our customers to see very clearly the social impact their purchase has on the world rather than a simple dollar amount.
For example, for every yellow case purchased, Soles4Souls will provide shoes for 2 children in Haiti that so desperately need them.
Where are the cases manufactured?
Coconut cases are designed and manufactured in Shenzhen, China. The facility has passed the ISO9001 and ISO14001 audits. 
Is there a charge for International Shipping?
Yes, there will be a $10 charge to ship internationally. 
If you have any specific questions about your location, please email us at whatsup@coco-email.com

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>We are a collection of young driven people and:</p>
<p>We formed Nespec because we were sick of having to deal with all the frustrations that come with the current process of sharing files between digital storage devices on the market. We felt it was time a digital storage device was built that was extremely easy to use and also utilized the latest technologies available, facilitating the sharing process.</p>
<p>Through these thoughts and by addressing the issues we have uncovered through market validation we have design the Strata Drive.</p>
<p>Strata Drive is important to us because we are all strong believers in a design lead approach to problem solving. The design process is such a powerful tool and we love the satisfaction that comes from solving a problem with an elegant solution, such as the problems around digital storage. </p>
<p>We have done everything in our power to get the Strata Drive as close to production as possible. What we need your help with is taking the final step.</p>
<p>We really believe in this product, and hopefully you can see the benefits in it as well. Help us to revolutionize the experience we all have around the sharing of digital files.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Strata Drive"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/YBrdo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What You Get &amp; What We Need </strong></p>
<p>Strata Drive is a physical hard drive that is designed to seamlessly connect through its unique ‘one clip’ mechanism. We have designed an App for smart devices that will ‘talk’ to the drives once they are connected and act as a remote enabling easy sharing of files between the drives without the need to go through a computer.</p>
<p>With your help and funding we hope to produce at least 1000 units and make them available for sale. What we plan to do with the money is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase the hardware components</li>
<li>Manufacture the electronic boards</li>
<li>Manufacture the hard drives cases</li>
<li>Develop the final stages of the app for iOS and Android</li>

We are a collection of young driven people and:
We formed Nespec because we were sick of having to deal with all the frustrations that come with the current process of sharing files between digital storage devices on the market. We felt it was time a digital storage device was built that was extremely easy to use and also utilized the latest technologies available, facilitating the sharing process.
Through these thoughts and by addressing the issues we have uncovered through market validation we have design the Strata Drive.
Strata Drive is important to us because we are all strong believers in a design lead approach to problem solving. The design process is such a powerful tool and we love the satisfaction that comes from solving a problem with an elegant solution, such as the problems around digital storage. 
We have done everything in our power to get the Strata Drive as close to production as possible. What we need your help with is taking the final step.
We really believe in this product, and hopefully you can see the benefits in it as well. Help us to revolutionize the experience we all have around the sharing of digital files.
 

 
What You Get & What We Need 
Strata Drive is a physical hard drive that is designed to seamlessly connect through its unique ‘one clip’ mechanism. We have designed an App for smart devices that will ‘talk’ to the drives once they are connected and act as a remote enabling easy sharing of files between the drives without the need to go through a computer.
With your help and funding we hope to produce at least 1000 units and make them available for sale. What we plan to do with the money is:

Purchase the hardware components
Manufacture the electronic boards
Manufacture the hard drives cases
Develop the final stages of the app for iOS and Android
Establish distribution channels
We have optimized the Strata Drive’s file transfer system enabling you to transfer files without the need of a computer. Saving you endless amounts of time waiting for your files to copy, time you could spend doing more productive things!
You may be thinking ‘but what if I’m the only one of my friends with this drive?’ Don’t worry we have thought of that as well. And through our hardware engineering we will make it possible to connect standard hard drives using USB technology to the Strata Drive, still enabling sharing from the Strata Drive to the standard drive via the smart device app.
 

 
The Impact
We feel anyone using the Strata Drive would find it a great asset because of the ease of its use and also the experience you will have using it.
Sharing in its very nature is such a strong emotional, connection between people. And being able to apply this concept of social sharing to digital storage using the latest technology is fantastic.

<h2>Navigation &amp; Discovery Of, By, and For ""Walkers""</h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The problem with navigation apps is that they’re designed for driving, not walking. The detail you want is 20 feet at a time, not 100 feet or a mile. Worse if you are directionally challenged and unable to read maps.</p>
<p>Considering all the problems with existing navigation apps, we are currently developing <b>a pre-installed navigation &amp; local discovery app that adopts augmented reality and very intuitive user interface so that anyone, even the directionally challenged, never have trouble using while walking. </b></p>

</div></div>","For the Pleasure of Exploring This Beautiful World 

The world around you is full of wonders. 
So much so that we need a device and applications that under no matter what condition, anyone can get around safely and see things they’ve never noticed before. 
That is why we built Telepathy Walker, the world's first eyewear for personal navigation and discoveries while walking. 








It’s highly intuitive user interface will make navigating and exploring a breeze -Lumoid

   Why Walker Excels at Navigation & Local Discovery 
Handsfree & Multitask-Friendly


Click here for full SMART-WARS Movie
Walker's navigation/discovery app responds to voice commands. It’s totally handsfree, allowing you to look ahead even if you are carrying luggage in both hands. You can even have a VoIP call on Walker's chat application at the same time.




Navigation & Discovery Of, By, and For ""Walkers""

The problem with navigation apps is that they’re designed for driving, not walking. The detail you want is 20 feet at a time, not 100 feet or a mile. Worse if you are directionally challenged and unable to read maps.
Considering all the problems with existing navigation apps, we are currently developing a pre-installed navigation & local discovery app that adopts augmented reality and very intuitive user interface so that anyone, even the directionally challenged, never have trouble using while walking. 




( VIDEO: See how people are reacting to Walker's new walking and navigation experiences) 
All you have to do to get to destinations is tell Walker where to go and simply follow the arrow!








*Walker's actual navigation has audio guidance. 




*Indiegogo backers can use Walker's navigation app for free of charge. The monthly fee for those who purchased Walker after this Indiegogo campaign will be Approx. $5 (pricing is subject to further changes). Regarding the use of the application, the terms & conditions may apply.



Walker is More Than Just A Navigation/Discovery Device



In addition to our navigation/discovery app that people will never have trouble using, we are also developing other outdoor applications so that you can explore the world in completely new and entertaining ways.
Some of the applications we are developing include, but not limited to the following:

Location-based Augmented Reality Games

Turn the world into playground 
Video: How Augmented Reality Looks Like through Walker 
(Estimated time of launch: Early 2017)


Vision Sharing

Let your friends see the world you actually see
 (Estimated time of launch: June or July 2016)


Simultaneous Interpretation


Don't let language hold you back in exploring the world

(Estimated time of launch: Winter 2016)


We are also building our own web-based app marketplace where anyone can develop, distribute, purchase, and/install apps for Walker. Walker runs on Android 4.4 Kitkat, so anyone who has developed apps for Android OS can develop apps for Walker with ease. We will start developing mobile-friendly app marketplace once we succeed in this campaign and in fulfilling all the rewards.
We are now doing everything we can to create a vibrant developer community through communications, incentives, and technical supports.



Why Indiegogo? -Ready for Mass-Production

Walker is more than just an idea. We have recently finished the final stage of prototyping and are ready to start mass-production. In fact, we successfully demoed Walker for 4 consecutive days. 


(Demo at CES)


(Demo at Pioneers Asia)

There are no other devices that run on Android 4.4 and are cheaper and of better quality than Walker. Walker is also ready for production enough to stand with 4-consecutive demo days at CES 2016.
The thing about hardware is, however, it’s hard. It takes hard money to go to production. With this Indiegogo campaign, we‘re looking to raise funds mainly to get us into mass production. We firmly believe in Indiegogo's strong, innovative community and hope to explore this beautiful world together.

In-depth Tech Descriptions for Tech Enthusiasts


Electronics



In an attempt to create a small, light, and portable smart eyewear, we developed a brand-new SoC made up of CPU, memory controller, and input/output. By layering memory and storage device on top of the SoC, we successfully materialized a smart eyewear with a very small footprint.



Optics


Walker's optical design consists of two separate parts: eyepiece and display parts. This separation creates a space between the two, which enables natural vision that is not interfered by the device's components.
In order to attain natural vision and high usability, virtual image is located 2 meters ahead from the eyepiece. By this, we successfully reduced the moving distance of focus between background and virtual image.






We also invented a small, lightweight, high-light-efficiency, and low-power-consumption display module specialized for smart eyewear from scratch.

Due to this cutting-edge optical structure with integrated lens technology, we are able to show a world's best-in-class resolution, color reproducibility, and brightness with minimal components.


Risks & Challenges
[See above for the product, technology, and this Indiegogo campaign.]
We think that the production risks are quite low since we have already produced ""Telepathy Jumper"", our B2B smart eyewear product, for various industrial customers and have done extensive trials in terms of hardware, middleware, OS(Android 4.4), and applications.
Our cutting-edge virtual display and optical system technologies have received extremely good reputations from industrial customers. These core technologies are used in Walker too and ready for high-volume manufacturing in cooperation with a Japan-based experienced electronics giant.
The components of Walker are already in production. we are working with well-established component suppliers and entire supply chain is already in place. Assembly site is also in Japan, which enables us to provide ""Made in Japan"" hardware quality.
Moreover, we successfully demonstrated several Android applications running on a prototype version of Walker at CES 2016, which proved that our product is ready for mass-production.
The risks are therefore minimal for producing Walker in volume for our Indiegogo backers, but there are certain risks that we would like to be honest and clear about.
For one thing, delivery date may be delayed approximately for a month or so, depending on FCC(USA) and IC(Canada) approval process.
Another risk is that whereas we are in talks and working with various application developers, some of the aforementioned applications EXCEPT for navigation/local discovery app may not be delivered at the expected launch dates.

<p>Our first prototype was developed based off the original Bluetooth 
2.0 version. This was a proof of concept project and allowed us to iron 
out any issues and to focus on getting Postifier to do exactly what it 
is suppose to do.</p>
<p>Once we were satisfied with the results, we started work on the next 
generation Bluetooth SMART (Low Energy) version using a TI system on 
chip module. We chose this as it increased the battery life 
significantly.<br/></p>
<p>The size of Postifier is also important. We wanted something that sat
 inside the Postbox and wasn't obtrusive. We have managed to squeeze all
 the components into a size similar to a box of matches.<br/></p>
<p>We partnered up with experts in the electronics field specialising in
 sensors and wireless technology. Our engineers have spent the last 9 
months designing several PCBs, coding firmware and testing many 
different sensors and Bluetooth modules.</p>
<p>Real world testing has been completed and we are extremely happy with the results. <span>Since our first campaign was unsuccessful, we re-thought our goals and were able to make modifications and negotiate with manufacturers to reduce the total funding required to get Postifier off the ground.<br/></span></p>
<h2>Why we need your help</h2>
<p>All internal electronics, firmware, connectivity and iPhone app is

<ul>
<li>The design of the custom, small and weatherproof enclosure</li>

<li>Regulatory testing and approval</li>

<p>With the funds raised we are confident we can achieve all of the above and get Postifier into your Postbox.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span>Here's How It Works</span></h2>
<p>Postifier has reusuable adhesive, so you stick it to the inside roof 
panel of your Postbox. The sensor detects change in infrared light when mail is inserted into your Postbox. The Bluetooth module then activates 
and waits for pairing with your smartphone.</p>
<p>You need Bluetooth enabled and the application running (minimised) in
 background and that’s all there is to it. You will now be notified on 
your smartphone before you reach your Postbox, or when you drive into 
your driveway and <strong>never again open an empty Postbox!</strong></p>
<p>Once the notification appears on your smartphone, the application 
opens and you press OK. This will get Postifier ready for the following

</div><p>We are a dedicated team of developers, designers &amp; problem solvers. We believe that <i>everyone has a right to data privacy</i> and because of this we are building <a href=""https://cloudfleet.io/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CloudFleet</a>, a hardware and software solution that will allow you to communicate safely &amp; securely via email.</p><h1>Problem of centralized cloud services</h1><p>A lot of us use centralized cloud services like Gmail, Yahoo &amp; Dropbox. They are free and easy to use, but also give the service providers access to everything you do. Every email, personal message, political statement, even your general attitudes and tastes expressed through these services are exposed and surveilled. This personal information is then used to serve you targeted advertisements as your digital profile is sold to other companies. This is not done just with your data alone — the same is done for millions of other cloud service users. Imagine what dystopian future movie scenarios could potentially become a reality if this continues. No central entity should have that much power!</p><p>The good news is that with recent software and hardware advances, there really is no reason for it to be this way! That smartphone you have in your pocket now is more powerful than the old email servers used in enterprise environments 10 years ago. With the CloudFleet Blimp, we want to use these advances in order to put a personal data center in every home and decentralize cloud services once and for all!</p><h1>What exactly is a CloudFleet Blimp?</h1><p>The <a href=""https://cloudfleet.io/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CloudFleet</a> Blimp is an easy-to-use device that enables you to communicate securely via email. You set up your own email service just by simply plugging it in!

We believe that everyone has a right to data privacy and because of this we are building CloudFleet, a hardware and software solution that will allow you to communicate safely & securely via email.Problem of centralized cloud servicesA lot of us use centralized cloud services like Gmail, Yahoo & Dropbox. They are free and easy to use, but also give the service providers access to everything you do. Every email, personal message, political statement, even your general attitudes and tastes expressed through these services are exposed and surveilled. This personal information is then used to serve you targeted advertisements as your digital profile is sold to other companies. This is not done just with your data alone — the same is done for millions of other cloud service users. Imagine what dystopian future movie scenarios could potentially become a reality if this continues. No central entity should have that much power!The good news is that with recent software and hardware advances, there really is no reason for it to be this way! That smartphone you have in your pocket now is more powerful than the old email servers used in enterprise environments 10 years ago. With the CloudFleet Blimp, we want to use these advances in order to put a personal data center in every home and decentralize cloud services once and for all!What exactly is a CloudFleet Blimp?The CloudFleet Blimp is an easy-to-use device that enables you to communicate securely via email. You set up your own email service just by simply plugging it in! After that, you use it just as you would any other cloud service — using any device and from anywhere.

<p>The Barman is an easy-to-use drink mixing platform that uses Bluetooth 4.0 and your Smartphone to mix up any drink in seconds.</p>
<p>Just place your glass on the Barman, pick the drink you want to make, select your drink size, and mix! The Barman will tell you what to pour, and when. It has an easy to read progress indicator that shows you how much of each component you have left to pour. In addition, your drink glass will turn from blue to red alerting you to stop pouring. In seconds, you will have your favorite cocktails mixed like a pro.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/142278/files/20131019080512-progress.jpg?1382195112"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Barman App has hundreds of popular drinks, but if for some reason you don’t find one you like, make your own! The Barman will allow you to enter in your own drink recipe using the “Drink Learn” feature. Just enter the drink components into the app, mix up your drink, and the Barman will learn the proportions of each component and store the recipe.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/142285/files/20131019080715-photo6.png?1382195235"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Once you have finished making your drink, you can post it to Facebook or Twitter. Your friends can then download your drink to their Barman and mix one of their own. Share a drink with a friend that lives across the country, or even in another part of the world. You can also add your drink to the “User-Submitted Drinks” for others to try. You can vote on drinks other users have submitted, and have others vote on your drinks.</p>
<p>No matter what drink you create or download, the Barman will allow you to fine tune your drink exactly to your liking. Increase or decrease any component, make a drink stronger or weaker, or add and remove components. You can then save that drink to your personal drink library, which allows you to recreate that drink perfectly every time.</p>

<p>Why did we make it?</p>
<p>Everyone wants to be able to mix great drinks quickly, easily, and precisely the way they like it. Whipping out a large recipe book and measuring shots with jiggers is a pain. You have to look at the recipe, hold the jigger in one hand, the bottle in the other, trying not to over-pour, then look back at your recipe, and so on… It’s not an easy task.</p>
<p>The idea for the Barman came to me in 2007 while struggling to make the perfect Long Island Ice Tea for my wife. I thought, there has to be a better way to easily mix drinks accurately.</p>
<p>There had been some DIY drink mixing machines that emerged in the past. They often required a large footprint, a long setup time, many tubes and pumps that had to be sanitized after using, were expensive, and then you had to find a place to store it all when you were finished. No one wants to spend all that time setting up, taking down, and cleaning something especially when they are only going to make a few drinks with it. They also had some major pitfalls. They were not very good at dispensing carbonated beverages and were not capable of mixing solids such as sugar or salt which are found in many cocktail recipes.</p>
<p>My goal was to make a product that made drink-making easy, accurate, and fun. Early prototypes of the Barman allowed us to make the drinks we wanted. Unfortunately, the “ease” factor wasn’t there. These prototypes only allowed us to store only a dozen recipes. Updating those recipes required the removal of an SD Card from the unit to download new recipes from a computer. It wasn’t something I thought wasn't worthy of the masses. With the evolution of Smartphones with Bluetooth, the version of the Barman I had imagined became possible. </p>
<p>The Barman is everything we set out to create.  It’s small, easy-to-use, accurate, can mix carbonated components, can mix solids such as sugar and salt, and it’s fun. My high school electrical technology teacher always said, “Keep it simple.” That is just what we did!</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>The Barman uses a combination of hardware and software to prepare perfect cocktails. It utilizes something called differential weighing, a technology found in most commercial-grade postage machines. Inside the unit is a load cell that measures mass and interfaces with software on the onboard microcontroller. This allows the Barman to measure only the components of the drink while excluding things like ice, glasses, and drink shakers. The result is an accurate drink making machine with an easy user interface.</p>
<p>When the unit is powered on, it goes into “standby”, waiting to receive a drink recipe. When the user selects a drink and drink size from the application on their Smartphone, the drink recipe is sent via Bluetooth to the Barman unit. In less than a second, the recipe is processed and the Barman is ready to mix your drink. Because the Barman uses proportions in its drink recipe database, the recipe is perfectly scaled to make any size drink, while keeping the taste exactly the same.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">-Mixes any drink, any size (within reason).</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">-Customizes any drink to your specifications.</span></p>
<p>-Lets you know what drinks you can make with the ingredients you have.</p>
<p>-Gives you the capability to share or download drinks with your friends anywhere anytime.</p>
<p>-Saves your favorite drinks so you can replicate the perfect drink every time.</p>
<p>-Mixes any type of liquid component including carbonated beverages.</p>
<p>-Allows you to mix in solids such as sugar and salt.</p>
<p>Disclaimers:</p>
<p>The appearance and design of the Barman may change between now and final production. It is likely to be smaller and thinner and it may not be made out of wood.   Because the Barman uses mass to measure the drink components, touching the unit or glass during mixing may throw off the measurements. By modifying the software, we have controlled this issue so that a minute touch will not affect the measurements. However, a substantial or prolonged bump of the unit may throw off your recipe.</p>
<p>International orders can be tricky.  Therefore, we reserve the right to cancel and refund any international pledges that exceed the shipping fee. We will try our best to ship all international orders.  This project is a project of EBC Services LLC. The device featured in this project is Patent Pending.</p>

<p>It has been a very hard, long, and rewarding journey. I am pleased to see something I had imagined for so long finally become a reality. Now I want others to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>The challenge we currently face is getting our product into production and finishing the development of the Android Barman App (IOS has been completed), however, we have done our homework and are ready to go. We are currently in pre-production and testing our first samples. Our manufacturer has 100+ employees, 10 R&amp;D Engineers, and are ISO:9001, CE, and Rohs certified. They also have extensive experience working with load cells and both Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0. </p>
<p>Some things may change as we finalize the design for manufacturing. Our manufacturer suggests that the Barman be thinner and smaller, black in color, made of quality durable ABS, and have a tempered glass surface.

<p>We need YOU to make it happen!</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","The Barman is an easy-to-use drink mixing platform that uses Bluetooth 4.0 and your Smartphone to mix up any drink in seconds.
Just place your glass on the Barman, pick the drink you want to make, select your drink size, and mix! The Barman will tell you what to pour, and when. It has an easy to read progress indicator that shows you how much of each component you have left to pour. In addition, your drink glass will turn from blue to red alerting you to stop pouring. In seconds, you will have your favorite cocktails mixed like a pro.


The Barman App has hundreds of popular drinks, but if for some reason you don’t find one you like, make your own! The Barman will allow you to enter in your own drink recipe using the “Drink Learn” feature. Just enter the drink components into the app, mix up your drink, and the Barman will learn the proportions of each component and store the recipe.


Once you have finished making your drink, you can post it to Facebook or Twitter. Your friends can then download your drink to their Barman and mix one of their own. Share a drink with a friend that lives across the country, or even in another part of the world. You can also add your drink to the “User-Submitted Drinks” for others to try. You can vote on drinks other users have submitted, and have others vote on your drinks.
No matter what drink you create or download, the Barman will allow you to fine tune your drink exactly to your liking. Increase or decrease any component, make a drink stronger or weaker, or add and remove components. You can then save that drink to your personal drink library, which allows you to recreate that drink perfectly every time.




Why did we make it?
Everyone wants to be able to mix great drinks quickly, easily, and precisely the way they like it. Whipping out a large recipe book and measuring shots with jiggers is a pain. You have to look at the recipe, hold the jigger in one hand, the bottle in the other, trying not to over-pour, then look back at your recipe, and so on… It’s not an easy task.
The idea for the Barman came to me in 2007 while struggling to make the perfect Long Island Ice Tea for my wife. I thought, there has to be a better way to easily mix drinks accurately.
There had been some DIY drink mixing machines that emerged in the past. They often required a large footprint, a long setup time, many tubes and pumps that had to be sanitized after using, were expensive, and then you had to find a place to store it all when you were finished. No one wants to spend all that time setting up, taking down, and cleaning something especially when they are only going to make a few drinks with it. They also had some major pitfalls. They were not very good at dispensing carbonated beverages and were not capable of mixing solids such as sugar or salt which are found in many cocktail recipes.
My goal was to make a product that made drink-making easy, accurate, and fun. Early prototypes of the Barman allowed us to make the drinks we wanted. Unfortunately, the “ease” factor wasn’t there. These prototypes only allowed us to store only a dozen recipes. Updating those recipes required the removal of an SD Card from the unit to download new recipes from a computer. It wasn’t something I thought wasn't worthy of the masses. With the evolution of Smartphones with Bluetooth, the version of the Barman I had imagined became possible. 
The Barman is everything we set out to create.  It’s small, easy-to-use, accurate, can mix carbonated components, can mix solids such as sugar and salt, and it’s fun. My high school electrical technology teacher always said, “Keep it simple.” That is just what we did!
How does it work?
The Barman uses a combination of hardware and software to prepare perfect cocktails. It utilizes something called differential weighing, a technology found in most commercial-grade postage machines. Inside the unit is a load cell that measures mass and interfaces with software on the onboard microcontroller. This allows the Barman to measure only the components of the drink while excluding things like ice, glasses, and drink shakers. The result is an accurate drink making machine with an easy user interface.
When the unit is powered on, it goes into “standby”, waiting to receive a drink recipe. When the user selects a drink and drink size from the application on their Smartphone, the drink recipe is sent via Bluetooth to the Barman unit. In less than a second, the recipe is processed and the Barman is ready to mix your drink. Because the Barman uses proportions in its drink recipe database, the recipe is perfectly scaled to make any size drink, while keeping the taste exactly the same.
-Mixes any drink, any size (within reason).
-Customizes any drink to your specifications.
-Lets you know what drinks you can make with the ingredients you have.
-Gives you the capability to share or download drinks with your friends anywhere anytime.
-Saves your favorite drinks so you can replicate the perfect drink every time.
-Mixes any type of liquid component including carbonated beverages.
-Allows you to mix in solids such as sugar and salt.
Disclaimers:
The appearance and design of the Barman may change between now and final production. It is likely to be smaller and thinner and it may not be made out of wood.   Because the Barman uses mass to measure the drink components, touching the unit or glass during mixing may throw off the measurements. By modifying the software, we have controlled this issue so that a minute touch will not affect the measurements. However, a substantial or prolonged bump of the unit may throw off your recipe.
International orders can be tricky.  Therefore, we reserve the right to cancel and refund any international pledges that exceed the shipping fee. We will try our best to ship all international orders.  This project is a project of EBC Services LLC. The device featured in this project is Patent Pending.

It has been a very hard, long, and rewarding journey. I am pleased to see something I had imagined for so long finally become a reality. Now I want others to enjoy it.
Risks and challenges
The challenge we currently face is getting our product into production and finishing the development of the Android Barman App (IOS has been completed), however, we have done our homework and are ready to go. We are currently in pre-production and testing our first samples. Our manufacturer has 100+ employees, 10 R&D Engineers, and are ISO:9001, CE, and Rohs certified. They also have extensive experience working with load cells and both Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0. 
Some things may change as we finalize the design for manufacturing. Our manufacturer suggests that the Barman be thinner and smaller, black in color, made of quality durable ABS, and have a tempered glass surface. The LCD will be mounted underneath the glass preventing liquids from destroying it. We plan to keep the LCD backlit in blue, however we may switch from a 16x2 LCD to a customized LCD if funding permits. This customized LCD will serve the same function as the 16x2 LCD, it will just have a different appearance. We are planning to keep the functionality of the Barman the same. We will only change the functionality of the device if we believe it is an improvement, or the change is necessary for the device to function properly.
Our team will then extensively test the units and provide feedback to the manufacturer for final adjustments. Once we are satisfied with the design, we will give the green light for production.

<h3>How we will do it</h3>
<p>The team consists of one designer/ electrical engineer, one product analyst, and a public relations expert. The plan is simple. After the project is funded, the founder of the Team Kobion, Onur Cem Altun will go see our East Asian manufacturers, and supervise the production in order to ensure the quality is not compromised. </p>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><strong>Q-</strong> <strong>How many refills can you get from a can of fuel?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A-</strong> A regular can of butane is 300ml. And the fuel tank inside the device is ~60ml. That means, you can refill The Smart Charger 5 times with a can of fuel.</p>
<div>
<strong>Q-</strong> <strong>Once the tank is filled completely, how many times can I charge my phone until the tank is emptied? </strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>A-</strong> Once fully refilled, the device is capable of supplying 37.2 watt hours of energy.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The battery of an iPhone 5 is 5.45 watt hour, which means you can fully charge your iPhone 5 -7- times. On the other hand, a Nokia C5-03 has a 3.70 watt hour battery, which means it can be charged up to 10 times. Look at your phone's watt hour measurement to be sure.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Q-</strong> <strong>How do you know if the fuel tank is full or empty?</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>A-</strong> In the final production version of the product that you will be shipped out, there will be a line of glass next to the butane tank where you can see how much fuel is remaining.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Q-</strong> <strong>How does the ignition button work? Do you twist/turn it or push it?</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>A-</strong> In the production version of the product, the ignition button, which you push, will work to ignite the heater. This is called piezo ignition and the same mechanism is used in camping stoves, gas grills and some lighters. The valve this button controls will also stop sending fuel to the heater when the device is running.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, you will push the same button to stop and start charging.</div>
<div class=""im"">
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Q-</strong> <strong>Does it know when the device is fully charged, or does it keep on charging?</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>A-</strong> For the sake of simplicity and reliability, there is no mechanism to sense how much your mobile phone is charged.  You will be able to turn it off manually after your mobile phone is fully charged. </div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Smart Charger is intended to be a mobile, on-the-go device to have at your side and use when your normal charger or outlets are not available.</div>
<h3>What is under the hood? </h3>
<div class=""template oembed"">In basic terms, a thermocouple, a cooling fan, a heating unit, and a butane tank… A thermocouple is a device that converts temperature difference to electricity. They are widely used in industrial applications as heat sensors. The specific name of the thermocouple that is used for generating electricity is the thermoelectric generator. There are semiconductor p–n junctions inside. The typical efficiency of such a device is 5%-8%. However there are devices that have an efficiency around 10%. </div>
<p>The cooling fan is needed to keep the thermal gradient stable through the thermoelectric generator. The efficiency greatly increases when a cooling fan is added. It also supplies air to the combustion chamber which increases the efficiency of burning. </p>
<p>The catalytic heater used in the device enables 95% thermal efficiency. There is no visible flame in the catalytic heaters. The advantages of such heaters are flameless heating, and full control over the temperature. </p>
<p>The butane tank is a regular butane tank used in cigarette lighters. The only difference is the size. Also, there are additional insulation coatings for safety concerns. </p>

How we will do it
The team consists of one designer/ electrical engineer, one product analyst, and a public relations expert. The plan is simple. After the project is funded, the founder of the Team Kobion, Onur Cem Altun will go see our East Asian manufacturers, and supervise the production in order to ensure the quality is not compromised. 
Frequently Asked Questions
Q- How many refills can you get from a can of fuel?
A- A regular can of butane is 300ml. And the fuel tank inside the device is ~60ml. That means, you can refill The Smart Charger 5 times with a can of fuel.

Q- Once the tank is filled completely, how many times can I charge my phone until the tank is emptied? 

 

A- Once fully refilled, the device is capable of supplying 37.2 watt hours of energy.
 
The battery of an iPhone 5 is 5.45 watt hour, which means you can fully charge your iPhone 5 -7- times. On the other hand, a Nokia C5-03 has a 3.70 watt hour battery, which means it can be charged up to 10 times. Look at your phone's watt hour measurement to be sure.
 

Q- How do you know if the fuel tank is full or empty?

 

A- In the final production version of the product that you will be shipped out, there will be a line of glass next to the butane tank where you can see how much fuel is remaining.
 

Q- How does the ignition button work? Do you twist/turn it or push it?

 

A- In the production version of the product, the ignition button, which you push, will work to ignite the heater. This is called piezo ignition and the same mechanism is used in camping stoves, gas grills and some lighters. The valve this button controls will also stop sending fuel to the heater when the device is running.
 
So, you will push the same button to stop and start charging.

 

Q- Does it know when the device is fully charged, or does it keep on charging?

 

A- For the sake of simplicity and reliability, there is no mechanism to sense how much your mobile phone is charged.  You will be able to turn it off manually after your mobile phone is fully charged. 

 
The Smart Charger is intended to be a mobile, on-the-go device to have at your side and use when your normal charger or outlets are not available.
What is under the hood? 
In basic terms, a thermocouple, a cooling fan, a heating unit, and a butane tank… A thermocouple is a device that converts temperature difference to electricity. They are widely used in industrial applications as heat sensors. The specific name of the thermocouple that is used for generating electricity is the thermoelectric generator. There are semiconductor p–n junctions inside. The typical efficiency of such a device is 5%-8%. However there are devices that have an efficiency around 10%. 
The cooling fan is needed to keep the thermal gradient stable through the thermoelectric generator. The efficiency greatly increases when a cooling fan is added. It also supplies air to the combustion chamber which increases the efficiency of burning. 
The catalytic heater used in the device enables 95% thermal efficiency. There is no visible flame in the catalytic heaters. The advantages of such heaters are flameless heating, and full control over the temperature. 
The butane tank is a regular butane tank used in cigarette lighters. The only difference is the size. Also, there are additional insulation coatings for safety concerns. 
Who we are
We are members of Team Kobion who have been relentlessly working for months to make a dream come true. All of us have expertise related to our key roles in the team. Onur Cem Altun is an electrical engineer graduated from Koç University in İstanbul. Ferah İlhan is a graduate student in biomedical engineering in Bogazici University. Our public relations expert, Mitch Morrison graduated from George Washington University in D.C with a degree in International Relations. You will be able to meet us at the Exclusive Launch Party in İstanbul. 

Where We Are In The Development
We have a working prototype, but it costs a lot. To make it affordable for the consumer market, we have to produce a relatively large quantity. The only way to do this is to crowdsource the demand upfront, which is why we are here. We need your support to make our dream come true. The figure below illustrates how much we need, and how we will use the funds for the mass production.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I’m Patricia Ju, CEO/CTO of <a href=""http://hackerbilt.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hackerbilt, Inc.</a> I started Hackerbilt because I have a passion for inventing productivity tools that make work fun. I’d like to introduce you to our brand-new creation: “<a href=""http://thescrumball.com/?lrRef=AZ1ZJ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Scrumball.</a>” What's Scrum? It's a project management methodology that allows fast, iterative, agile creation of products, services, even businesses. The Daily Stand-up is one technique in Scrum and other agile methodologies used by 75% of surveyed software development companies.</p>
<p>The Daily Stand-up is a status meeting that replaces weekly/monthly long meetings run in hierarchical organization structures with instead daily 15 minute (or LESS!) meetings driven by self-organized, highly-engaged flat teams. How do you have a team status meeting in 15 minutes or less? Each member stands, literally. (The meeting goes faster if people have to stand!) Then, each member in turn answers these questions:</p>
<p>“What did I do yesterday?” “What will I do today?” “What blockers do I have?”</p>
<p>When done right, the entire team hears the succinct status and blockers. Relevant members discuss among themselves later in the day if they need further details. As a Scrum Master who's run multiple Scrum teams, I’ve found two main issues that crop up at the Daily Stand-ups:</p>
<ul>
<li>We run out of time when people don't stick to the three questions.</li>
<li>In the heat of the moment, we often forget what we wanted to say. </li>
</ul><p>Wouldn’t it be great to have a tool that let you know how much time you had left? That reminded you of what you planned to address in the meeting? That would allow you to literally toss your ideas around the room?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>
<p>The Scrumball combines your smartphone, the fun of a rugby ball, and the power of our custom productivity apps to do just that. The smartphone fits into the rugby ball enclosure, and is kept secure from short passes and drops. (The iPhone Lite App is in Beta and the Android version will come out late summer).</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Lite and Pro Apps</h3>
<p>The free <strong>Scrumball Lite App</strong> shows a large counterdown timer so you can see how much time you have left. The three status questions help you focus on answering those. When you're done, throw the Scrumball to the next team member for their turn. </p>

<p>The Scrumball Lite free iPhone app (Android version coming late summer)</p>
<p>The <strong>Scrumball Pro App</strong> lets you set up connections to email, calendars, issue trackers, source control logs, and Agile project management tools (i.e. Basecamp, Pivotal Tracker, Rally, JIRA, VersionOne, and any others we can get our hacker-hands on). With the Scrumball Pro’s account link feature, you can quickly scroll through what you did yesterday all in one place and share your status updates with the team. You can even quickly prepare ahead of time by marking the important status items which float to the top of the screen, ready for you when it's your turn. The Pro version will be a premium subscription service available to individuals and teams, and is planned to launch in the first calendar quarter of 2013.</p>

<h3>The Ball</h3>
<p>The Scrumball itself is a rugby ball-shaped smartphone enclosure that securely holds a smartphone, allowing you to control the companion apps, toss the ball to the next team member, and take advantage of accelerometer features for a fun and invigorating Daily Stand-up.</p>

<h2><strong>Current Status &amp; Positive Discoveries</strong></h2>
<p>The Scrumball Lite iPhone App Beta launch coincides with the start of this fundraising campaign. Apply for the Beta-Test Program <a href=""http://bit.ly/KD0y43"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. Again, the Lite App is entirely free. </p>
<p>We've been using the alpha version in real scrum teams, tossing it around in a protective case, triggering the accelerometer, and iteratively improving the user experience to be ever simpler and more intuitive. We've already made positive discoveries in that since my team started using the Scrumball Lite App, no one's gone over their 1 minute time limit except me. (Bad ScrumMaster, Bad!) And the reason I went over is because I was fumbling around trying to get to my calendar to see what I did the day before. Enter, further proof of the need for the Scrumball Pro App.</p>
<p>We also now have quotes from several manufacturers for the next phases of prototyping, tooling, and mass manufacturing of the Scrumball (which will be made of a non-toxic foam and bear color graphics). This is where you come in - we need your pledges to get through these phases, to launch the Scrumball Lite App, and to get started on the Scrumball Pro App.</p>
<p>I personally can't wait until the first machine-produced prototype is in my hands to play with-currently we're using a surgically reduced toy football of a popular brand as well as a very protective foam iPhone case. We can toss and drop (oops?!) the phone in this case, but it just still pales to the feel and fun of tossing around a rugby ball.</p>

<p>Best,<br/> Patricia Ju<br/> CEO/CTO Hackerbilt, Inc.<br/> Fun at Work</p>
<p> </p></div>","Hi there,
I’m Patricia Ju, CEO/CTO of Hackerbilt, Inc. I started Hackerbilt because I have a passion for inventing productivity tools that make work fun. I’d like to introduce you to our brand-new creation: “The Scrumball.” What's Scrum? It's a project management methodology that allows fast, iterative, agile creation of products, services, even businesses. The Daily Stand-up is one technique in Scrum and other agile methodologies used by 75% of surveyed software development companies.
The Daily Stand-up is a status meeting that replaces weekly/monthly long meetings run in hierarchical organization structures with instead daily 15 minute (or LESS!) meetings driven by self-organized, highly-engaged flat teams. How do you have a team status meeting in 15 minutes or less? Each member stands, literally. (The meeting goes faster if people have to stand!) Then, each member in turn answers these questions:
“What did I do yesterday?” “What will I do today?” “What blockers do I have?”
When done right, the entire team hears the succinct status and blockers. Relevant members discuss among themselves later in the day if they need further details. As a Scrum Master who's run multiple Scrum teams, I’ve found two main issues that crop up at the Daily Stand-ups:

We run out of time when people don't stick to the three questions.
In the heat of the moment, we often forget what we wanted to say. 
Wouldn’t it be great to have a tool that let you know how much time you had left? That reminded you of what you planned to address in the meeting? That would allow you to literally toss your ideas around the room?
 
The Solution
The Scrumball combines your smartphone, the fun of a rugby ball, and the power of our custom productivity apps to do just that. The smartphone fits into the rugby ball enclosure, and is kept secure from short passes and drops. (The iPhone Lite App is in Beta and the Android version will come out late summer).
 
The Lite and Pro Apps
The free Scrumball Lite App shows a large counterdown timer so you can see how much time you have left. The three status questions help you focus on answering those. When you're done, throw the Scrumball to the next team member for their turn.

The Scrumball Pro App lets you set up connections to email, calendars, issue trackers, source control logs, and Agile project management tools (i.e. Basecamp, Pivotal Tracker, Rally, JIRA, VersionOne, and any others we can get our hacker-hands on). With the Scrumball Pro’s account link feature, you can quickly scroll through what you did yesterday all in one place and share your status updates with the team. You can even quickly prepare ahead of time by marking the important status items which float to the top of the screen, ready for you when it's your turn.

Acorn is optimistic about its future. The team is committed to creating a sustainable business, with end-to-end support for our customers now and as the brand develops. We hope you have the same excitement and nostalgia as we do for the Acorn name, we want to make useful & serious tech products that improve daily life, help in education and bring people together, we don’t just want to make one-off retro games consoles!After the Indiegogo campaign Acorn aims to expand its portfolio and work with Corporations, Schools and Universities, Retailers, Investors, Acorn Enthusiasts & Hobbyists. Manufacturing back in Britain is one of our primary goals. We need your support to make Acorn great again!Its a lot of money to ask for right? There will be 48,000,000 smartphone users in the UK in 2018 and we hope a tiny fraction (3000) people share our dream of an Acorn phone.Getting a new Smartphone into production and into your hands only works when manufacturing efficiently at volume. The Acorn team is committed about the targets we have set, and want to be realistic about how we get there. In electronics term, 3000 units is actually really small!Acorn is committed to being a Responsible Corporation. We commit to remaining on-shore in the UK, and paying all the relevant taxes, VAT and Corporation Tax as well as being responsible for the end of life WEEE costs. To us it just makes sense.Are you making a profit? Acorn is making a small profit as well as covering our expenses. This is primarily being fed back into the company to help reinvigorate Acorn as a UK tech company.Is it better than iPhone or Galaxy? The Micro is our flagship product and we love it, but spec for spec it doesn’t aim to compete with these super-high-end phones, both which are excellent (if you want that kind of thing and are willing to pay a premium). The Micro is designed to be a “#SmarterPhone”- a better choice for most people's daily needs- while delivering great value for money! We arnt trying to be in the same premium market as these giants, even if some of their success can be traced right back to the Acorn pioneers!  About

What is it?​

Simply put, the Micro Phone C5 is a modern, big-screen Android smartphone with four cameras and fingerprint security, 4G and Wi-Fi connectivity, and a great overall spec.
Our team thinks it lets the most people get the best of modern digital life, at the optimum value for money.



Where is it being made?
We're a small, lean, passionate team based in London & Brighton, collaborating with international partners including Google™.  The Micro Phone will be assembled and packed in China, and overseen by independent third parties to international standards and certifications. Our ultimate goal is to bring manufacturing back to the UK, but first things first!


Why are you crowdfunding?

We love crowdfunding! For us, it's a perfect solution to ensure we meet minimum order quantities for the first production batch and to gain grassroot support from Acorn lovers in the UK
The Micro Phone will only be produced with a fully funded Indiegogo campaign – so we need your backing to make Acorn great again!



How much does it cost?
There are various “Perks” you can see at the top of this webpage. Perks are 'Indiegogo speak' for what you get in return for backing a campaign, in this case an awesome phone!


Where can you buy it?
Only on Indiegogo! You can’t buy this product anywhere else and it won’t happen without your support!


Whats in the box?

5.7” Micro Phone  C5 Smartphone
UK USB Charger 5V,
Quick Start Guide,
SIM Tray Pin,
12 Month Warranty,
UK Tech Support.



Will you make accessories?
The accessory bundle for the Micro, including 2 x Cases & 3 x Screen Protectors are sold separately.

 Whats Next?

What stage are you at now?

We have a fully working and rigorously tested Engineer’s Prototype that our team is confident will pass the required statutory certifications and Google approvals to bring it to market in the UK.
We believe the Micro Phone is compliant with the Android CDD (software and hardware requirements for a compatible Android device) and the firmware can pass the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS), GMS (Google Mobile Services) approval and relevant Widevine requirements for digital content. 



What happens after its funded?

After the campaign is (hopefully!) funded we will finalise all the manufacturing details (mainly the latest firmware security) updates and start producing!
We will then start the final GMS approval process that will run simultaneously while the hardware is compiled, SMT’d and assembled. Once we have the final sign-off the approved firmware will be added and the Quality Assurance process will start.Your Micro will be fully tested before it goes in the box!


  Shipping

When can we expect it to arrive?
Orders are expected to be delivered towards the end of May.


Where do you ship?​
To offer our customers the best experience and technical support, the Micro Phone is shipping to the UK only.


What about taxes?
UK backers will have all UK VAT paid by Acorn (its included in the price).


What are the challenges of delivering late?

Certification and GMS approval is an external process. While we have taken this time into our schedule, there may need to be adjustments.
In case of any delays to the shipping process we will keep all backers fully updated.


 Customer Service

Is there a warranty?​
Yes, the Micro Phone comes with a 1 Year Warranty. You can find full details of our Warranty Terms at www.AcornComputers.com


What is your refund policy during the Indiegogo campaign?
See these steps on How to Request a Refund. During the Indiegogo campaign, you can process the refund at any time by contacting support@indiegogo.com or searching their help center. Refunds are processed on a case-by-case basis; at some point we will need to lock refunds in order to go into production & shipment. We will not be able to refund orders once they've shipped.

<h2>3 IMPORTANT THINGS FOR CONTRIBUTING!</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>THIS IS A CROWDFUNDIND PROJECT, YOU MAKE IT POSSIBLE</h3>
<p>Crowdfunding is a new way for transforming creative ideas into reality. Our goal is to reach 45.000€ for funding the plastic injection moulds and the toolling required for manufacturing. I<span class=""TextoM-fondo-bl1"">f enough people ""pre-order"" the MOBBO and the HANDDO on this site before August 18, we will be able to make this project possible. In the meanwhile, Indiegogo will retain all the funds and will only give us the money at the end of the campaign if we succeed. If that occurs, we will manufacture the MOBBOs and the HANDDOs and will ship them to you by the end of November. In case we don't reach our goal, then you will get your money back, we will not receive a cent and the project will not be done. If you want to help this project come true, you can choose one of the perks on the right column and make your contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class=""TextoM-fondo-bl1""> </span></p>
<h3><span class=""TextoM-fondo-bl1"">PRICES ARE IN € BUT YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE IN US$ OR IN ANY OTHER CURRENCY</span></h3>
<p><span class=""TextoM-fondo-bl1"">Prices are in EUROS because our design studio is based in a EURO-ZONE country. Anyway, once you make your contribution, PayPal will automatically convert your charge into your local currency according to the official exchange rate.</span></p>
<p><span class=""TextoM-fondo-bl1""> </span></p>
<h3><span class=""TextoM-fondo-bl1"">PLEASE ADD ""MANUALLY"" YOUR SHIPPING COSTS!</span></h3>
<p><span class=""TextoM-fondo-bl1"">Remember adding your shipping costs if you order from outside the province of Barcelona. Shipping costs are 8€ for most perks and 21€ for the 3 FRIENDS PACK. For doing so, once you are in the contribution screen you will have to EDIT MANUALLY the price that appears in the white bar. Delete the prize you see (for example €39) and type the new amount including your shipping costs (for example €47) That will mean that you are contributing with 39€ for your product + 8€ for your shipping costs. </span></p>

<h2>WE ARE TAMBAKUNDA, a design studio from Barcelona</h2>

<p>We are a team of engineers, architects and designers that help companies to innovate through design and technology. We design products, services, spaces and brands, but some months ago we decided to create a brand of our own, SHOULDERPOD, and our first products; MOBBO and HANDDO, a holder and a handle for helping people tell better stories with their smartphones. For knowing us better and for getting in touch, please visit <a href=""http://www.tambakunda.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.tambakunda.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.shoulderpod.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.shoulderpod.com</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why we need your help?</h3>
<p>Because we need a minimum number of pre-orders to fund the injection moulds and tooling required to manufacture the MOBBO and the HANDDO. At the moment we have completed the design process, we have built and tested the prototypes, we have designed a wonderfull packaging and we are ready for investing in production. And here is where you come in. So if you want to participate in making this project possible, you can support us by placing a pre-order, and only if we meet our funding goal, will you be charged for your contribution. In return we will send the MOBBO and the HANDDO to you as soon as they pop out from our Barcelona workshop.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How long will it take us?</h3>
<p>Our Indiegogo campaign will end on August, 18. If we make it, we will receive the funds two weeks later. Manufacturing the injection moulds and tooling will take us arround two months and a half, plus three more weeks for production and logistics. We expect shipping our first units to you by the end of November 2013. Need an idea for your Christmass gifts? Here you are! During these months we'll keep you informed of the progress of the project at our website.</p>

3 IMPORTANT THINGS FOR CONTRIBUTING!
 
THIS IS A CROWDFUNDIND PROJECT, YOU MAKE IT POSSIBLE
Crowdfunding is a new way for transforming creative ideas into reality. Our goal is to reach 45.000€ for funding the plastic injection moulds and the toolling required for manufacturing. If enough people ""pre-order"" the MOBBO and the HANDDO on this site before August 18, we will be able to make this project possible. In the meanwhile, Indiegogo will retain all the funds and will only give us the money at the end of the campaign if we succeed. If that occurs, we will manufacture the MOBBOs and the HANDDOs and will ship them to you by the end of November. In case we don't reach our goal, then you will get your money back, we will not receive a cent and the project will not be done. If you want to help this project come true, you can choose one of the perks on the right column and make your contribution.
 
PRICES ARE IN € BUT YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE IN US$ OR IN ANY OTHER CURRENCY
Prices are in EUROS because our design studio is based in a EURO-ZONE country. Anyway, once you make your contribution, PayPal will automatically convert your charge into your local currency according to the official exchange rate.
 
PLEASE ADD ""MANUALLY"" YOUR SHIPPING COSTS!
Remember adding your shipping costs if you order from outside the province of Barcelona. Shipping costs are 8€ for most perks and 21€ for the 3 FRIENDS PACK. For doing so, once you are in the contribution screen you will have to EDIT MANUALLY the price that appears in the white bar. Delete the prize you see (for example €39) and type the new amount including your shipping costs (for example €47) That will mean that you are contributing with 39€ for your product + 8€ for your shipping costs. 
 
  
WE ARE TAMBAKUNDA, a design studio from Barcelona

We are a team of engineers, architects and designers that help companies to innovate through design and technology. We design products, services, spaces and brands, but some months ago we decided to create a brand of our own, SHOULDERPOD, and our first products; MOBBO and HANDDO, a holder and a handle for helping people tell better stories with their smartphones. For knowing us better and for getting in touch, please visit www.tambakunda.com and www.shoulderpod.com
 
Why we need your help?
Because we need a minimum number of pre-orders to fund the injection moulds and tooling required to manufacture the MOBBO and the HANDDO. At the moment we have completed the design process, we have built and tested the prototypes, we have designed a wonderfull packaging and we are ready for investing in production. And here is where you come in. So if you want to participate in making this project possible, you can support us by placing a pre-order, and only if we meet our funding goal, will you be charged for your contribution. In return we will send the MOBBO and the HANDDO to you as soon as they pop out from our Barcelona workshop.
 
How long will it take us?
Our Indiegogo campaign will end on August, 18. If we make it, we will receive the funds two weeks later. Manufacturing the injection moulds and tooling will take us arround two months and a half, plus three more weeks for production and logistics. We expect shipping our first units to you by the end of November 2013. Need an idea for your Christmass gifts? Here you are! During these months we'll keep you informed of the progress of the project at our website.

 
Convince your friends and save!
Convince your friends so you can benefit from our special group offers. By selecting one of our ""friends"" perks you will share shipping costs and save money. Only available for our INDIEGOGO backers.

  

THANK YOU all for being part of the SHOULDERPOD project, for sharing it and for making it possible!
Our special thanks to all our team; Elena, David, Jordi, José María, Juan and Sergi for participating with their huge talent during the design process. To Ricardo, our studio neighbour, for his collaboration and his patience, to Roberto for his time and his experience telling stories, to Martín for his wonderful sports clips, to Ali for the British revision of our text, to Don for his warm and friendly voice, to Alex and Mónica for their generosity with their D90, to Inés for her charming instagram moments, to Elena and Rafa for their wonderful ""stretch arm"" portraits, to Mariona and Asa for their touch of glamour, to Miguel and Berta for sharing their time and their family in the park, to Alexis for the professional studio moments, to Tabita for her endless smile, to Xavi and Alex for taking me for the first time to the Barça stadium, to Xavier and Maia for a great Saturday concert, to the BARCELONA DESIGN CENTER for their MID support and to the Fundació CIM, for their help with rapid prototyping. Our thanks as well to all the people that kindly accepted to participate in the video ... and to all the anonimous travellers who visit Barcelona every year for inspiring us. To all of you, smartphone storytellers, here's to you! 
THANK YOU!

<h1>The Dual Droid TV Stick.</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>We been investigating Android HDMI sticks for a while.  Up until now nothing has peaked our interests.  They have all been lacking.  Some lack in speed.  Some lack in space.  Some lack in memory.  Some of them just plain don't work right.</p>
<p>Then along came this little dual core stick.  It was cute and cuddly.  Almost furry with its 1.2Ghz brains.  Its little 1GB of ram.  And its teeny 4GB flash.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">The specifications are almost standard these days.</div>
<p>It needed a little bite.  <em>Some sharp teeth.</em></p>
<p>No one has actually come out with a TV stick that addresses the issues of speed, memory, and space.  With your support we will provide that solution.</p>
<p>We've talked to the manufacturer of the above TV stick and are having a custom version made to our specifications.  </p>
<p>We want to provide something that we would buy ourselves.</p>
<p>Sure you could buy something for the present,  or you could invest in what's coming.</p>
<p><strong>It will feature the following:</strong></p>
<p>Android 4.04</p>
<p>1.6Ghz Dual Core Cortex A9 RK3066 SOC</p>
<p>Mali 400MP4 Quad Core GPU</p>
<p>2GB of ram(because the future will come sooner than you think)</p>
<p>16GB of Flash Nand(4GB just isn't enough)</p>
<p>Wifi b/g/n with Direct Connect</p>
<p>Micro SD card slot</p>
<p>Male HDMI 1.4</p>
<p>Full Size USB host port</p>
<p>Micro USB port for power</p>
<div class=""template asset""> </div>
<p><strong>Current Status:</strong></p>
<p>We have received samples of the Dual Droid TV Stick and have been extensively testing it.  Although underclocked at the moment to 1.2ghz it scored a low of 6310 and a high of 6821 in Antutu Benchmark.  We expect our 1.6GHZ version to be a bit faster.</p>
<p>At the moment the underclocked version of the Dual Droid TV Stick consumes between 1A to 1.3A at 5V.  We expect the 1.6GHZ version to consume between 1.5A to 1.75A.</p>
<p>The Wifi worked very well over our router.  Web browsing is fast.  Even flash video's played well...on desktop versions of sites. </p>
<p>Video has been a breeze with it's support of 1080p playback.  The stock video player is easy to use.  Hardware decoding is supported by popular players available in the Play Store.</p>
<p>We even tested an unofficial nightly build of XBMC on it(it was able to stream SD content with almost no dropped frames at 50% cpu usage.)</p>
<p>If our goal is met our aim is to have this at everyone's location before Christmas! </p>
<p><strong>Current Pictures:</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is a sample we received from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>The casing and color will be changed. A mockup of what the Dual Droid TV Stick will look like is featured in the Gallery.</p>
<p>We'll be adding more pictures and videos as this project continues.</p>
<p>A standard US Quarter is in the picture for size reference.</p>

<h3><strong>An Offline App - why? </strong></h3>
<p>After years of studying abroad and visiting different places around the world, it became clear to us that making friends and meeting new people became harder and harder over these years. The mentality of people changed drastically. </p>
<p>Back then when you wanted to become friends with someone, you would try to get to know them first, and they would do the same. Unlike today where people have this superficial swiping mentality and judge people on their “profile picture” and a few lines to define themselves with. </p>
<p>So we thought, we need to do something about that and go a little bit back in time. <br/> </p>
<h3><strong>The launch of NETME</strong></h3>
<p>Soon enough we figured, the easiest way to bring together what we were looking for and the  situation how it is nowadays was to build a connection between our smartphones, which are currently indispensable, and real-life meetings.</p>
<p>On NETME you no longer have to stress over boring online texts, discussions, bad pick-up lines or embarrassment over bad impressions. Instead you can simply browse the map, pick out somewhere to have your next lunch break and send an invitation to someone nearby to come and join you!</p>

<h3><strong>What makes NETME unique? </strong></h3>
<p>CONNECT ONLINE, MEET OFFLINE <strong>- </strong>that being said.. with NETME your networking game will definitely change!</p>
<p>All of us know a variety of apps we use while meeting up with friends, like Yelp, Foursquare, Google maps or WhatsApp. </p>
<p>What if there was an App that combines all of them and even lets you decide if you want to meet up 1:1, in a group, near your hometown or in that town you're going to stay next week? </p>
<p>An app as flexible as your life style? You will find all of that with NETME. Meet up whenever, wherever and with whoever you want to, in a locality of your choice. </p>

 Devices  you can  chage with EnerJuice

Bring EnerJuice with you and charge your  devise with your motion
While you move, the internal battery of EnerJuice stores the energy  so you can use it  when you need it.
 

 
EnerJuice,  the best kinetic powerbank 
EnerJuice has considerably increased the power production compared to other standard kinetic devices. This is because standard kinetic chargers use the weight of the magnets to generate energy. EnerJuice instead  uses  the  weight of the battery togheter with the weight of the magnets to generate more power.

<li>and authenticate logins and transactions with secure two-factor authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Including a SDK for App Development and Infrastructure Servers for the Authentication.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Moto Z is a smartphone built for fitting every imaginable requirement. Be it the possibility to transform it into a beamer or a sound blaster. But what if you merely want to enjoy a quiet evening, drink some wine while reading a novel? We got you covert. Simply attach the ElySiUM Mod to your Moto Z: A 4.3” capacitive <u>multi-touch</u> display - larger than the screen used in the iPhone 5. Read books, browse the web, even play games with the low energy E-Ink technology. Read and write emails in high contrast. All this without a blinding bright screen. Also enjoy its glare free high contrast in bright sunlight, on the beach or in the park.</p>
<p>Afraid that your Moto Z or the data on it gets stolen? You don't trust your virus detection software since all trojan horses and viruses evolve too fast? Reports about creditcard data stealing apps appear more and more. See <a href=""http://www.shanghaidaily.com/world/Cybercriminals-targeting-data-theft-from-smartphones/shdaily.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1</a>,<a href=""https://www.goodcall.com/news/financial-apps-010207"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2</a>,<a href=""http://www.informationsecuritybuzz.com/articles/cybercriminals-biting-android-users-banking-data-banks-not-moving-fast-enough-adopt-preventative-technology-says-promon/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">3</a> and many more news. But once the ElySiUM Mod is attached to your Moto Z you have a malware proof display available. Unavailable for malicous apps. Using our End-to-Display Encryption (E2DE), all data can be sent to it encrypted and will be never seen in plaintext on the Moto Zs processor, and therefor all its apps. Use a common crypto token to decrypt your data when required. Moreover it provides you a trojan proof two-factor authentication to identify yourself to any (web-)service.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488299615/j6h5ztwwbhbwgcptoqgf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Using a common standard, we currently support secure two-factor authentication to these platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>eBay</li>
<li>salesforce</li>
<li>Dropbox</li>
<li>GitHub </li>
<li>and many others</li>
</ul>
<p>These steps are required to perform an E2DE-supported two-factor authentication on the ElySiUM Mod:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your services login screen (on the Moto Z or another device)</li>
<li>Receive an E2DE-encrypted challenge</li>
<li>Plug your E2DE privacy SIM card into the ElySiUM Mod</li>
<li>The decrypted challenge is displayed on the E-Ink</li>
<li>Solve it using your second factor</li>
<li>You are logged in</li>

<h3><strong>Create your own Apps</strong></h3>
<p>An essential feature developed within our campaign is the SDK that allows you to connect your apps to ElySiUM. Thereby you can easily create your own applications, which use the possibilities of the second screen and the security components.</p>
<p>Want some examples? Display status infos of the Moto Z without wasting battery; e.g. weather, clock, or missed calls. Interact with the E-Ink displays content to write emails or documents. How about a control interface for your smart home? Create more challanging games that use the E-Ink display as new gamelayer. Include secure factor authentication into your service using the E2DE-technology while increasing customers user experience. No matter what you do: The low power consumption of E-Inks will give you additional time!</p>
<p>Do you have a good idea? Want to sell it? Go for it! Get the developer edition in the perks. We can build 100 pre-production Mods and send them to you as soon as they are ready. These may not look like the final product, but they will work just like them. Together with the SDK, where you also get exclusive pre-release access, you can start the development sooner and be ready for market when we ship the rest of the Mods.</p>
<p>If you have a good idea, but you don’t want to develop it yourself? Contact us. We are always interested in good ideas and offer support / project coordination.</p>
<p>The SDK will be OpenSource (we did not yet decide the license, we will update you in time) as soon as we have a status ready for public access. So even if you wait for the non-developer edition, you will also be able to program for your Mod.</p>
<h2>Status</h2>
<p>Since 2012 we are researching in the area of the end-to-display encryption. Last year we started our first production run for the decryption chip, which will be part of ElySiUM. It is comparably easy to connect the technology to desktop PCs, but we always struggled to find a mobile platform, which can connect our security features, and still be secure. However, we started developing our E-Ink module in the beginning of 2016. Knowing, that an E-Ink attachment for smartphones may be the easiest way to add cool features to a smartphone. Of course, our solution should have a multi-touch capability. We achieved that requirement last year!</p>

<h3>App Development</h3>
<p>Parallel to the hardware implementations we developed the first apps for sharing, sending and receiving data from ElySiUM Mod. Right now, we are connecting these features with the Moto Z through the Moto Mod connectors.</p>
<p>We also showed a fully functional prototype for our authentication scheme. Enabling easy to remember but still strong two-factor authentication challenges.</p>

<h2>Funding Goal and Schedule</h2>
<p>First, we would like to point out, that we planned this campaign not to be a campaign to build a prototype. Our goal is to deliver the final product to all the backers of those rewards. For this, we spoke with suppliers and already have most of the pricing for calculations. Because of this, we also know that due to most parts having a minimum order quantity, we are not able to activate the flexible funding option. Our supporters already help us building the prototype regardless of the campaign.</p>
<p>Our prototyping phase is almost finished. However, a big hike is still ahead of us. The manufacturing, designing the enclosures and packaging, sourcing materials, finding producers and suppliers. We already have a large number of parts ready for order and some we will manufacture to our specification.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have to get FCC and CE Certification, as well as Motorola Approval for the final product. These tests also include EMV testing. For the authentication method over FIDO we also have to be certified.</p>
<p>Here is a graphic, how we will use the funds we hope to receive in this campaign. All shares have their respective buffer if something unplanned happens, which often happens.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488295797/k8xgoavtihx3svbje30a.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Fees &amp; Royalties are shares we have to pay to Indiegogo and Motorola for using the platforms and the licensing.</p>
<h3>Extended Goals</h3>
<p>Of course we have some more ideas for the ElySiUM Mod. Should we reach more than 3.000 backed units(200%), we will make the ElySiUM Wireless! We add a battery and low-energy wireless controller to our ciruit for free. This will make the Mod usable without the attached Moto Z. You could read an email while on the phone. Or surf the web while your kid plays a game on the Moto Z.</p>
<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>We already started the development, so given here are some milestones when we want to finish with the tasks and ship the final products.</p>

<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>We are confident in our ability to produce our ElySiUMMods given the successful funding. But, there are some parts in the process we can’t yet foresee. These are for example the quality and availability of parts manufactured and ordered. These may or may not be within the high standard we want to ship to our costumers. Therefore it may be necessary to reorder or extend the timings for these parts.</p>
<p>Further has the product to be certified for the import into the US and the EU. These processes can only be marginally planed. Resulting in not plannable delays.</p>
<p>We planned with a fair amount of buffer for either price and time, but those buffers may be calculated to narrow and may even result in an unsuccessful production. As these processes and parts are brand new, this is the case for all Mods currently developed.</p>
<h3>Shipping Restrictions</h3>
<p>Please note that we may not be able to ship to your country due to shipping restrictions. We will probably ship with DHL, so if they ship to your Country from Germany, than that should be ok, if there are no embargos against your country in place.</p>

These are for example the quality and availability of parts manufactured and ordered. These may or may not be within the high standard we want to ship to our costumers. Therefore it may be necessary to reorder or extend the timings for these parts.
Further has the product to be certified for the import into the US and the EU. These processes can only be marginally planed. Resulting in not plannable delays.
We planned with a fair amount of buffer for either price and time, but those buffers may be calculated to narrow and may even result in an unsuccessful production. As these processes and parts are brand new, this is the case for all Mods currently developed.
Shipping Restrictions
Please note that we may not be able to ship to your country due to shipping restrictions. We will probably ship with DHL, so if they ship to your Country from Germany, than that should be ok, if there are no embargos against your country in place.",7.0,2,"1 Campaign

I have been a consultant for many electronics companies over the past 20 years, designing and developing many products.  I recognized the need for an organized, centrally located charging facility and developed the Universal Multi-Port Chargers.</p>
<p>The Universal Multi Charger series was created for our ever growing obsession with mobile electronics and the need to charge them all at the same time in one location properly.  I was tired of having different charging adapters all over the house in different rooms charging different devices because I needed more wall sockets.  My wife would clean house some mornings and put my cables with devices away in a draw and after a while I forgot which adapter went with what device.  The success of tablet adapters further complicated the charging problem.  No longer were chargers for devices interchangeable because tablets took more current wattage then phones, Mp3s etc. </p>
<p>There are currently on the market only a few docking/charging products, but they can only charge a few items, and are device specific, like Apple's iHome, which can only charge Apple products.  Our chargers can charge all devices, including phones, tablets, games, headsets, etc that have a USB charging plug, and can charge up to three times more than comparable current marketed products.  Our projected price points are competitively priced against the competition.</p>
<p>Even though my iPhone and iPad adapter looked the same, they both charge at different rates of electrical current so when I mixed them up they would not both charge at the fastest rate properly.  This was also true with some other mobile devices I had.   I did some research and found out that most adapters only charge at one rate and is made for one device only and if I accidentally switched them up, they would not charge properly.  So I worked with some electrical engineers and helped developed a chip that would recognize and always provide the correct electrical current automatically no matter what the device current requirements.  We call this SCD (Smart Current Detection) technology.</p>
<p>With your help, I can bring this product to you and your friends, families and relatives.  If you can't contribute and receive these new unique products, tell your friends and family for me.  Get the word out about these great devices that will solve the problems of multiple device charging and organizing.</p>
<p>I am in the final stages of developing and manufacturing these exciting new products for charging smart phones and personal devices. This project includes three products all designed around a technology to provide the fastest possible charge without over charging device batteries. An added attribute is an attractive full feature alarm clock. </p>
<p>Currently, I've invested over $100K and need working capital to purchase parts and factory time. The moulds for two of the products along with the electronics are complete. Hand made samples have been sent to BV for ETL and FCC certification. </p>
<p>The following three steps describe the remaining process: </p>
<p>1) Order parts and components including: plastic material for moulds, speakers, transformers, amplifiers and printed circuit boards. </p>

<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><p>Where the App can stop you, it will.  Where the app cannot defend itself, it
will report you.  It is a simple
mechanism of QDRIVE will stop you, or catch you.</p>
<p>Where phone use cannot be locked out (someone bypasses the
App, iOS constraints) an exception report is sent our QDRIVE server.  Should anomalies occur in the exception
reporting (multiple battery removals, abuse of valet mode, etc.), SYNQ reports
the abuse and potential risk to the parent (if applicable), insuring party
and/or governing road safety authority.</p>

</span></div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Road Safety and Insurance Premiums:</span></h3>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
<p>Rear end collisions are on the rise, and in addition, personal
injuries claims as a result of rear end collision have reached an all-time high.  Very few drivers are implicated in
charges or refusals of insurance coverage when a Smartphone contributes to an
accident.  Police generally do not
attend in instances of rear end collisions, the exact scenarios where
Smartphones are the leading cause. 
</p>
<p>People are not rear ending people at 15 and 20km (6-10mph)
anymore, they are rear ending folks at 50km (30mph).  Why?  There is
no reaction time, they are rear ending people with their eyes in their lap.</p>

<h3>What sets QDrive ahead of the competition?</h3>
<p>Currently, all Smartphone while Driving mitigation technologies (apps) recognize an event (generally speed of travel), and then prompt the user to lockout.  For all apps that rely on speed of travel, their solution will always be reactionary; reacting to an occurring event.</p>
<p>As a result, this assumption, must build in back doors and exits for those in passenger seats or using transit.  </p>
<p>Now ask yourself a question, </p>
<p><b>Patent Pending:</b></p>
<p>A patent has been submitted and update has been made to that patent during the course of prototype development.  </p>

<h3>FAQ:</h3>
<div></div>
<p><b>What if I lost my phone?  </b>What if you lost your keys?  We know exactly how important phones are to us in our lives, soon they will replace our wallets.  QDRIVE is just one more reason to ensure you have your phone at all times.</p>
<p><b>What if my Smartphone battery is dead?  </b>Charge it in your car via cigarette lighter.</p>
<p><b>What if I get a new phone?  </b>If the app does not transition over to your phone via cloud or computer sync (of the operating support system of your phone’s OS), it will be remembered in the app store where you originally downloaded it.  You will always want to ensure you update your account with QDRIVE when you have a new phone to ensure your EMEI code matches that on file with us.</p>
<p><b>What if I want to let someone borrow my car?  </b>Downloading the app is free.  Just provide them with the Bluetooth password for app connectivity.</p>
<p><b>If someone cracked the Bluetooth password, could they now steal my car?  </b>Your keys are still required to start and run your car, this is simply an immobilizer component.</p>
<p><b>Will my other Bluetooth devices still work for hands free?  </b>Yes, all Bluetooth devices still work even while being Bluetooth paired to QDRIVE.</p>
<p><b>Can I use GPS still?  </b>If your administrative functions are not restricted, the GPS direction will read aloud, however, no screen images will display in order to truly reduce the visual distractions of smart phones.</p>
<p><b>I am the mother of a new driver, can I lock out hands free devices as they are illegal for new drivers in my state/province?  </b>Yes, as the administrator of the hardware, you allow for users to have hands free device functionality or not.  This is customizable, driver profile to driver profile.</p>
<p><b>What if I have a dead vehicle battery?  </b>You go through the same routine if you had a dead car battery without QDRIVE, however, must use QDRIVE in order to trigger starter.</p>
<p><b>I have a Blackberry, will this work?  </b>Yes, Blackberries will be supported via the Android application.</p>
<p><b>I have a windows phone, will this work?  </b>Relatively same functionality as iOS?</p>
<p><b>What about Telematics?  </b>We look to launch an optional update in the future following the release of QDRIVE with integrated telematics.  Stay tuned.  </p>
<p><b>What are Telematics?  </b>Telematics are GPS metrics on steroids.  Not only do they show geographic data associated with GPS, but how a person go there including speed (include acceleration and deceleration), rapid lane change, etc.</p>
<p><b>Does my remote start function still work?  </b>With some vehicle start programs, you may need to lockout first (you will have approximately 30’ communication between your QDRIVE and your phone).  </p>
<p><b>How much is the service if I want to continue after the first year?  </b>Annual subscription services for consumer use are $49.95, for fleet and business the charge is $199.95 per business, plus $59.95 per vehicle.</p>
<p><b>What happens if I don’t subscribe the following year?</b>  We will be unable to provide proof of use, and if you have an insurance credit, you may no longer be eligible.  </p>
<p><b>Insurance reduction?  </b>We’ve worked with many of the leading insurance companies in Canada and the USA, getting feedback on what the greatest driving risks are and if a preventable solution were available, would they give a discount?  The response by and large was an overwhelming yes.  Because apps using speed of travel as an indicator of driving cannot ‘enforce’ someone to use the app (passenger/transit), there isn’t a risk mitigation component to the strategy.  Essentially, having someone use a voluntary app with a backdoor for passengers and transit, is the same as saying “Do you pinky swear you won’t use your Smartphone when you drive?  Then here is your discount”.  Because QDRIVE requires an active phone to start the car, </p>
<p><b>Who can I speak with regarding an adjustment on my insurance premium?  </b>We ask that you get involved with the QDRIVE community in order to reduce premiums for those using QDRIVE.  We will provide certificates of use for all current QDRIVE subscription holders.  QDRIVE is the only provable technology that the policy holder isn't using their phone.  Never will a speed of travel app be able to do this.<br/></p>
<p><b>GM Ignition issues vs. Immobilizers?  </b>The critical difference between an ignition switch and an immobilizer is that an immobilizer cannot turn a vehicle off, rather, it can only prohibit a vehicle from starting (prevents vehicle starter from receiving signal/power).</p>
<p>On February 7, 2014, General Motors (GM) recalled about 800,000 of its small cars due to faulty ignition switches, which could shut off the engine during driving and thereby prevent the airbags from inflating.</p>
<p>In this instance, the ignition was faulty and ‘turning off’ the vehicle whereas QDRIVE does not have the ability to do so.  The only thing QDRIVE can do is prevent a vehicle from starting, not turning it off.</p>
<p><b>What about automotive legislation requirements for QDRIVE?  </b>In Canada, automobiles are now equipped with immobilization technology via chipped keys, active RFID fobs, and for older cars, aftermarket immobilizers meeting ULC-S.338 standard under Transport Canada's National Standard CMVSS114.  In the USA, a similar picture, but rather 49 USC CHAPTER 331.  </p>
<p>These legislative requirements have been developed as minimum guidelines (of which in today’s sophisticated security realm, are very minimum).  QDRIVE will be approved by an accredited laboratory (e.g. CSA, UL), for the appropriate standard of both Canada and the USA (further countries to be explored) to ensure that if this is the only immobilizer mechanism (older model cars), that it meets the legislated standard.  Currently, there is no legislation in place for a relatively new concept of having multiple layers of immobilization.</p>

</div></div>","What is QDRIVE?


 QDRIVE is a smartphone-driven vehicle immobilizer, whereby starting the car automatically locks the phone's screen.  
It's designed to not only stop texting and driving, much like Breathalyzer immobilizers do with drunk drivers, but provide proof to insurance companies that the policy holder cannot text and drive, justifying lower insurance premiums.





Features Of The App

Phone Lockout: The biggest feature of QDRIVE is smartphone lockout controlled by vehicle ignition. This feature is designed to block the user from mobile input during driving by requiring lockout in order to start the vehicle.








Valet Mode:Literally, no one can start your car now without locking out their phone, but don't worry, we'll built in the back end for user-ability without compromise.  Share your ride with valet mode. Simply set a timer, walk away, and let someone else do the driving. As a precautionary measure, the timer will prematurely end when the user's device reconnects.



Additional Features




Circumvention Prevention:

Where the App can stop you, it will.  Where the app cannot defend itself, it
will report you.  It is a simple
mechanism of QDRIVE will stop you, or catch you.
Where phone use cannot be locked out (someone bypasses the
App, iOS constraints) an exception report is sent our QDRIVE server.  Should anomalies occur in the exception
reporting (multiple battery removals, abuse of valet mode, etc.), SYNQ reports
the abuse and potential risk to the parent (if applicable), insuring party
and/or governing road safety authority.


Road Safety and Insurance Premiums:

Rear end collisions are on the rise, and in addition, personal
injuries claims as a result of rear end collision have reached an all-time high.  Very few drivers are implicated in
charges or refusals of insurance coverage when a Smartphone contributes to an
accident.  Police generally do not
attend in instances of rear end collisions, the exact scenarios where
Smartphones are the leading cause. 

People are not rear ending people at 15 and 20km (6-10mph)
anymore, they are rear ending folks at 50km (30mph).  Why?  There is
no reaction time, they are rear ending people with their eyes in their lap.


What We Need & What You Get

 QDrive needs your help to succeed in making the roads safer. If we reach our goal, we will push to deliver by May 2015.  Your funds will help us develop more robust software and hardware so we can get QDrive ready for road use.









What sets QDrive ahead of the competition?
Currently, all Smartphone while Driving mitigation technologies (apps) recognize an event (generally speed of travel), and then prompt the user to lockout.  For all apps that rely on speed of travel, their solution will always be reactionary; reacting to an occurring event.
As a result, this assumption, must build in back doors and exits for those in passenger seats or using transit.  
Now ask yourself a question, 
Patent Pending:
A patent has been submitted and update has been made to that patent during the course of prototype development.  
Legislation:
We’ve brought this in front of Provincial and Federal government members of parliament in Canada, and their response was that this should be part of legislation as a driver rehabilitation initiative for distracted driving.  Stay tuned for our updates.
Partnerships:


Those with partnership inquiries regarding telematics,
remote vehicle start, vehicle alarm, can contact SYNQ at qdrive@synqtech.com
The Impact
We ourselves admit, it can be really challenging sometimes not to check out that text, that email, that NFL notification.  Like a lot of things we shouldn’t do, unless someone stops us, we’re going to continue that activity.  





We all agree, Smartphones are addictive, and using them while driving is danagerous…QDRIVE is the solution.

   Risks & Challenges Feasibility of iOS and Windows Phone:Lockout functionality on iOS and Windows Phone is currently not possible due to existing limitations of the operating system. We are currently exploring other ways of reporting mobile use as a workaround, such as logging time spent outside of the QDrive app.


OBD Port:
We're currently working on reducing installation strain by powering and connecting the module via the OBD port.  Many obstacles are needed to overcome not from starter interlock, but, the circumvention concerns of the user simply 'pulling the plug'.

<h2><strong>What is unique with Four4?</strong></h2>
<p>The main reason the idea was brought to life is that i have never been satisfied with multi port chargers. They are built with cheap components and lack functions that i believe are prerequisite for safe and smart charging. Many of them are told to deliver high power but when they are put to the test, many of them fail in different aspects. Throttling the power output is most common, overheating or having very high voltage ripple are issues often found! </p>
<p>So I decided to design a charger having all safety functions possible including data integrity protection. It delivers the specified power, has a innovative touch sensor as UI and a display showing important charging and system information. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590999459/tutqnohfsbwoed1wrdni.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Data integrity protection/ Firewall</strong></h2>
<p>Use the Four4 as a standalone power splitter and USB condom. If you often charge your devices in public USB outlets you are always exposed for data intrusion and harmful spyware! Four4 isolates the data communication between your device and the public outlet. It analyses so that the USB voltage is within the correct limits before enabling charging to your device.  To connect the Four4 to a public outlet use a standard USB to DC jack adapter cable. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590999586/owei7ljnuphzqvn1n9vu.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h2><strong>Information is vital</strong></h2>
<p>The OLED display can be used to see if charging is ongoing but with time, the user will probably use it even more to monitor each channel, and make sure that charging is optimized. A good example is that you can compare different USB cables and how they affect charging current and time. You will be able to sort out good and bad cables. </p>
<ul>
<li> Input voltage. Check if you have correct input voltage. If it's on the lower end it will affect charging</li>
<li> Total power. Get information of how much power is delivered by the Four4</li>
<li> Current. Charging current for each channel is presented. Note that if current is below 100mA it's considered as maintenance charging and not shown in display</li>
<li> Active port. Active ports are marked with a pointer</li>
<li> Temperature. Show internal charger temperature with 5 degree resolution</li>
<li> Charging indicator.  Battery bar showing that charging is ongoing</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590999734/eecofaijz1intl5bwt4p.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>Always full power</strong></h2>
<p>All 4 channels are independent and each channel optimizes the charging current to be as high as possible to the connected device. Maximum current per channel is 2A. When many multi port devices throttle the power, Four4 will deliver 2A in each channel simultaneously.  </p>
<p>The Four4 can also be used as a 5V power supply to any non intelligent device and can deliver up to 3.2A/ port.  Only two ports with each 3.2A can be used at the same time. The two remaining ports will share 1.6A still available. </p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Compatible with most single board computers</strong></h2>
<p>Four4 is the perfect power supply for most single board computers. It delivers clean high power without any disruption. The 3.2 power supply mode can deal with the most power demanding board! </p>
<p> </p>

<li>Local manufacturing gives total control of the total product chain. Four4 is manufactured in Sweden by Alma Electronics. Only high quality components from well known suppliers are used. The charger has gone thru extensive testing with very good results. This increases chances for a product lasting long and not becoming electronic waste shortly after purchase. Four4 will ship from local storage, which results in shorter travel distances that are less carbon-intensive. All this reduces the environmental footprint. The factory follow Swedish employment laws and the working conditions are high!</li>
<li>The charger is designed to have as high efficiency as possible. As much power as possible is delivered into the connected devices. Therefore the whole system is powered with 5V and have extremely low internal resistance. The total power loss when charging at full power is around 2.5%</li>

Hopefully the world has better control of the virus sometime around late summer!</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","What is unique with Four4?
The main reason the idea was brought to life is that i have never been satisfied with multi port chargers. They are built with cheap components and lack functions that i believe are prerequisite for safe and smart charging. Many of them are told to deliver high power but when they are put to the test, many of them fail in different aspects. Throttling the power output is most common, overheating or having very high voltage ripple are issues often found! 
So I decided to design a charger having all safety functions possible including data integrity protection. It delivers the specified power, has a innovative touch sensor as UI and a display showing important charging and system information. 
 

 

 
Data integrity protection/ Firewall
Use the Four4 as a standalone power splitter and USB condom. If you often charge your devices in public USB outlets you are always exposed for data intrusion and harmful spyware! Four4 isolates the data communication between your device and the public outlet. It analyses so that the USB voltage is within the correct limits before enabling charging to your device.  To connect the Four4 to a public outlet use a standard USB to DC jack adapter cable. 

 


 
Information is vital
The OLED display can be used to see if charging is ongoing but with time, the user will probably use it even more to monitor each channel, and make sure that charging is optimized. A good example is that you can compare different USB cables and how they affect charging current and time. You will be able to sort out good and bad cables. 

 Input voltage. Check if you have correct input voltage. If it's on the lower end it will affect charging
 Total power. Get information of how much power is delivered by the Four4
 Current. Charging current for each channel is presented. Note that if current is below 100mA it's considered as maintenance charging and not shown in display
 Active port. Active ports are marked with a pointer
 Temperature. Show internal charger temperature with 5 degree resolution
 Charging indicator.  Battery bar showing that charging is ongoing

 

Always full power
All 4 channels are independent and each channel optimizes the charging current to be as high as possible to the connected device. Maximum current per channel is 2A. When many multi port devices throttle the power, Four4 will deliver 2A in each channel simultaneously.  
The Four4 can also be used as a 5V power supply to any non intelligent device and can deliver up to 3.2A/ port.  Only two ports with each 3.2A can be used at the same time. The two remaining ports will share 1.6A still available. 
 

 
Compatible with most single board computers
Four4 is the perfect power supply for most single board computers. It delivers clean high power without any disruption. The 3.2 power supply mode can deal with the most power demanding board! 
 

 
                 Why ECO designThere are two aspect of the Four4 Eco design philosophy.
Local manufacturing gives total control of the total product chain. Four4 is manufactured in Sweden by Alma Electronics. Only high quality components from well known suppliers are used. The charger has gone thru extensive testing with very good results. This increases chances for a product lasting long and not becoming electronic waste shortly after purchase. Four4 will ship from local storage, which results in shorter travel distances that are less carbon-intensive. All this reduces the environmental footprint. The factory follow Swedish employment laws and the working conditions are high!
The charger is designed to have as high efficiency as possible. As much power as possible is delivered into the connected devices. Therefore the whole system is powered with 5V and have extremely low internal resistance. The total power loss when charging at full power is around 2.5%
As a result of the low internal resistance the heat that is developed in the charger is one of the lowest on the market. Measurements below show the heat maps when charging with 40W for more than 3h, in 25°C / 77°F ambient temperature. The hottest spot internally is 59°C / 132°F and externally 39°C / 102°F.   Development journeySince the idea was born many prototypes were built and rejected. Both electronics, mechanics and software has been redesigned several times to achieve the desired quality. The product has matured to that state that several beta testers have used it for months without any complaints!  Extensive verification and redesigns based on best measurements has resulted in components from the suppliers below. Featured on  Feedback from early testers #Johan: ""I bought an electronic device that i charged with Four4.

<li>One clip is used to fasten the earphones in
the upper part of your clothes, ensuring that they don’t fall down and the
cable doesn’t bounce around. </li>
<li>The other clip is fastened either to the bottom

is the place you hold your mobile phone or MP3 player. </li>
<li>You stretch the cable
between the 2 clips so it isn’t bouncy and leave as much as you want before the
upper clip. </li>
</ul>

<b>Who</b><b> are we?</b>
</h3><div>
<p></p>
<p>We are a team of two
professionals each with specific experience in different field. </p>
<p>I am Vladimir Vladimirov –
business consultant with more than a hundred successful business and EU funded projects,
developed for different companies among which are banks, manufacturing companies
and service providers in our home country Bulgaria </p>
<p>The other member of our team
is Kalin Georgiev – a professional designer with extensive experience in
interior design, 3D design of furniture and other products, photography
enthusiast and keen biker. Kalin has a good track record in projects for SPA centers, interior design and furniture for offices as well as the design of
personal apartments.</p>
<p>Both of us have succeeded in
implementing projects for different clients and up to this moment our job was
to help people make their ideas happen. But we decided it is time to bring our
own crazy idea to life. We have many friends with start-ups and we grew
passionate of establishing one ourselves. </p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>We are committed to deliver!</b></h3>
<p>We have helped companies to bring dozens of projects and
products to
market over a period of 7 years. These
happened both through
licensing and through acting as the intermediary with the manufacturer. We have serious experience
with every aspect of the process. We have a track record of success and are
committed to integrity and excellence. Most of
all we are passionate and want to make things happen.</p>
<h3>
<b>Why Indiegogo?</b>
</h3>
<p>We as individuals or part of
other companies typically work on other people's amazing ideas and
designs to help bring
them to the market. We have worked with many contractors
and established contacts in the manufacturing industry due to our previous
experience. Thinking of new and innovative things sometimes makes us wonder how
we can facilitate our everyday life with simple design but yet smart concept
decisions. Thus we are now at the stage where we are excited and crave for the
challenge of making our own item

<p>We believe crowdfunding will allow us to
produce our very own product, rather than licensing it to another
manufacturer - again. Being in charge of the whole
process will ensure that the product we offer will live up to our vision and
our perception of real quality implementation.<br/></p>

<h3>Risks and challenges

</h3>
<p>With a product that consists
of only one piece, the main challenge is producing the basic tool for our manufacturing
– molding matrix. This is important moment because the whole production depends
on the tooling. We have arranged meetings and spoke with main manufacturers of
such equipment and manufacturers of plastic products as well and every single
one of them ensured us that the preparation of such instruments and equipment
can be done in up to 14 weeks time.</p>
<p>The second challenge is the
quality control of the
production and the materials. We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that our
manufacturing and supply partners offer the preparation of a molding matrix, initial tests, material
suggestions, excellent quality and compliance with the necessary legislative
requirement for the production of product such as The StereoClip. </p>
<p>Another challenge is the
size of our order. With larger orders the production cost can be reduced due to
economies of scale. The fact that the product is a single piece will facilitate
the production of additional quantities in short periods of time but will
however delay the production a bit. This delay is taken into consideration
while developing our plan.</p>
<p>In any case we will duly
inform all our backers on the progress of the project and when to expect the
product.</p>
<h3>
<b>What We Will Use the Funds For</b><b>?</b>
</h3>
<h4>We need $14,500.00 to
     reach our goal! We will use this money to pay for the tooling, molding, cover the cost of The StereoClip campaign
     perks, and pay for packaging, marketing
     and advertisement of this cool product as well as all the administrative costs
     related with the legislation. You can
     see the planned distribution of funds on the picture below:

<p><b>FAQ</b></p>
<p><b>Does The StereoClip support any type of cable?</b></p>
<p>Our current design fits almost
all cables of earphones – single, double, round and flat up to 2.5 mm thick. We
are planning special design for thicker cables once we reach our target so stay
tuned!</p>
<p><b>Does The StereoClip fit on any cloth?</b></p>
<p>The clip is currently designed
to fit on most of the materials. However it is not suitable for materials
thicker than 4 mm or thin slippery materials as we cannot guarantee it will
hold upside down without falling.</p>
<p><b>Do the perks include shipping?</b></p>
<p>Shipping is free only to
Bulgaria. Transport charges for all other countries are calculated automatically
when you add a perk. The couriers and postal services we have contacted promise
delivery within 5 to 20 days for all destinations.</p>
<p>Backers are responsible for
import duties and taxes if any. These are different depending on each country’s
import/export legislation. </p>
<p><b>Do you ship worldwide?</b></p>
<p>Yes we do, see the previous

So far we have tested the design and functionality of the product but there is still some work to be done in March 2016. We will keep updates if any changes occur.Technical specifications
   





The StereoClip is made of injection
molded high quality colored plastic. It is given a matte finish and is designed to last long enough to become your best friend while using your earphones. A pair of 2
clips weighs a mere 8 grams. It may also be used as a fashionable accessory, usable in your everyday
life without damaging your style.
Basic colors:




Key functions of The StereoClip:



Holds your phones to your
clothes, pockets, bag etc. not allowing them to fall on the ground;

Holds the phones cable
stretched so it doesn’t bounce around when you move, run, ride bicycle etc.;

Has a unique fashionable
design;

The StereoClip is extremely light
thus not stretching the clothes and not obstructing any movements.


Risks and challenges


With a product that consists
of only one piece, the main challenge is producing the basic tool for our manufacturing
– molding matrix. This is important moment because the whole production depends
on the tooling. We have arranged meetings and spoke with main manufacturers of
such equipment and manufacturers of plastic products as well and every single
one of them ensured us that the preparation of such instruments and equipment
can be done in up to 14 weeks time.
The second challenge is the
quality control of the
production and the materials. We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that our
manufacturing and supply partners offer the preparation of a molding matrix, initial tests, material
suggestions, excellent quality and compliance with the necessary legislative
requirement for the production of product such as The StereoClip. 
Another challenge is the
size of our order. With larger orders the production cost can be reduced due to
economies of scale. The fact that the product is a single piece will facilitate
the production of additional quantities in short periods of time but will
however delay the production a bit. This delay is taken into consideration
while developing our plan.
In any case we will duly
inform all our backers on the progress of the project and when to expect the
product.

What We Will Use the Funds For?

We need $14,500.00 to
     reach our goal! We will use this money to pay for the tooling, molding, cover the cost of The StereoClip campaign
     perks, and pay for packaging, marketing
     and advertisement of this cool product as well as all the administrative costs
     related with the legislation. You can
     see the planned distribution of funds on the picture below:






Stretch goal: $ 20 000 – We
will add some cool new colors in order to match different lifestyles and
personal desires. They are selected taking into consideration the main colors
of popular accessories – phones, cables, MP3 players, etc. and will be:

Our time plan


FAQ
Does The StereoClip support any type of cable?
Our current design fits almost
all cables of earphones – single, double, round and flat up to 2.5 mm thick. We
are planning special design for thicker cables once we reach our target so stay
tuned!
Does The StereoClip fit on any cloth?
The clip is currently designed
to fit on most of the materials. However it is not suitable for materials
thicker than 4 mm or thin slippery materials as we cannot guarantee it will
hold upside down without falling.
Do the perks include shipping?
Shipping is free only to
Bulgaria. Transport charges for all other countries are calculated automatically
when you add a perk. The couriers and postal services we have contacted promise
delivery within 5 to 20 days for all destinations.
Backers are responsible for
import duties and taxes if any. These are different depending on each country’s
import/export legislation. 
Do you ship worldwide?
Yes we do, see the previous
question.
If there are any changes concerning The StereoClip, we will
communicate these changes to our contributors in a timely manner.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

into a kid-friendly, worry-free device</i></b></p>
<p>Here’s a
familiar scene: one afternoon your child wants to watch Cookie Monster on
Netflix. You set it up, turn it on, and hand it to your child. Within <i>five seconds</i> your kid has accidentally
stopped the show and burst into tears. You restart the show and return it to
your hysterical child – only to have to repeat this cycle another five times!
Feeling very frustrated, you start looking for an app to lock your phone while
allowing your kids to use a chosen app, like Netflix. Then you see that <i>nothing </i>with amazing ratings shows up.
We want to change that.</p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>Video Coming Soon!</i></b></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Turn your Android phone or tablet into a kid-friendly, worry
free device</b></p>
<p>We want to
take the frustration out of that familiar scene. We want to create an app that
will let kids use your phone or tablet to play games, watch shows, look at
pictures, and more without the tantrums. We want to make an app that lets you
pick which app you want to use while locking the rest of the phone. No more
accidental exits, no more restarting the movie, and no more screaming.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,
there’s no app like this in the Play store. We’ve looked. There are a few
lock-screen apps available, but the majority of those are to keep your phone
locked – and unusable.  The other apps
keep your phone in “kid-mode” but those apps do not lock everything so your kid
or you can watch a movie without accidentally touching the screen and/or
buttons and turning it off. </p>
<p>We want to
make this app available for you and your kids. We want this app to be easy and
seamless. We want your kids to be able to watch their movie, play their game,
or look in your photo gallery. Furthermore, we want them to do it without the
screaming or hassle of “oops!” </p>
<p><b>How will it work?</b></p>
<p>After
copious research and talks with our development team, we have the plans,
designs, and know-how to make Lock It Baby a reality. Our Android app will lock
your phone but leave it as usable as you set it to be.  Lock It Baby will make it safe for your child
to borrow your phone or tablet. We have drafts of the interface and design of
the app, so be sure to look through the designs. </p>
<p>Need to
unlock your phone again? No worries. The app can be set to run on a timer, turn
off when both the home and power buttons are depressed simultaneously, or be
password protected. We’re still working on the exact details of this feature,
so be sure to voice your opinion!</p>
<p><b>Save time and money – while avoiding frustration</b></p>
<p>You’ll be
able to choose an app – like a movie or a game – to keep running once you
activate Lock It Baby. Once you start Lock It Baby your phone locks – and only
that predetermined app can run. </p>
<p>• 
Does your child want to watch a movie? Great! Start up the show and
then activate Lock It Baby. The screen will lock and the movie will play. No
more worrying about accidental pauses or exits. </p>
<p>• 
Does your child want to play a game? Start the game and Lock It, Baby!
Your child will be locked into that game. The screen controls will still work,
but that’s it.</p>
<p>• 
Plans for additional app styles are in the planning stages.</p>
<p>No more
frustrated children. No more screaming during car rides to the store, at the
restaurant, or during home computer time. Peace and quiet – all thanks to Lock
It Baby.</p>
<p><b>“I need this app! When can I get it?”</b></p>
<p>We have the

González, an electronic engineer by profession, born in Venezuela and currently
living in Chicago, IL.  I came to this
country to develop several of my ideas, since I also enjoy inventing. A few months
ago I obtained my first patent, which is for the project I present here.</p>
<p>The invention is called ""SWITCH AUDIO PC 5.1"" and
it is a switch that allows two or more computers to be connected to the same
audio system, and to select which computer will be heard at any given time. So,
for example, if you have a computer for general use and another for gaming, you
will not need an audio system for each, nor will it be necessary to disconnect
the speakers from one to connect the other, since both are connected to the
SWITCH AUDIO PC 5.1. At the touch of a button you can select the computer you
want to hear in the 6 speakers making up the 5.1 system.</p><p><span></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456196616/pbjzsarwalplqwtykutq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In this stage, contributors will help me develop a physical
model we will call ""Prototype B,"" which will be the basis for the
next stage, which is mass production.</p>
<p>I currently have a prototype I built myself. I used it for
three years in my country, before I came here, and it has never malfunctioned
on me. In the photo you can see it is totally homemade, analog and rudimentary.
I call it ""Prototype A."" If I am successful in reaching my estimated
target, the funds will allow me to take this rudimentary, analog and homemade
""Prototype A"" to being a good looking, sleek, digital ""Prototype
B."" According to my estimates, these funds will completely cover the
phases in the development stage, which are: Research, Sketching Concepts, 3D
CAD, Technical Specs, Prototype, Patent Drawings &amp; Text, Sourcing and
Agreement. Each of these phases has its own cost, and they add up to the amount
I hope to raise. So, the funds I raise in this campaign will be used to
complete this initial objective. If I do not reach my target, I will complete
as much as the funds allow me to do, and if instead I raise more than planned,
the additional funds will be used to build the first units.</p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456191950/pyb3o61kcrr2ilqrxs4i.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 625.959px;height: 355px;""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456192028/vtxoqbxsbxpjql5dghj5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456192080/pdhuu8b5wfwzogsj0fpm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/>
<p></p><p>Since I started using ""Prototype A,"" I have asked
many people: ""How many computers do you have at home?"" The answers I
have received, along with posts I have read on online forums dealing with the
same question, have surprised me, leading me to the conclusion that despite increasingly
prevalent new technologies such as smartphones and tablets, PCs are an
essential tool in our lives, so much so that it is now common to see two or
more in every home and even for a single user. A statistic published by Intel
towards the end of 2014 caught my attention: there are more than 700 million PC
gamers in the world. I know from experience that a PC assembled or purchased
with the latest technology for gaming is really used just for gaming. So, in
most cases, another, less powerful PC is needed for general day-to-day use, and
for mothers to google recipes and sisters to listen to Justin Bieber while
doing their homework. </p>
<p>Also, despite advances in wireless technology, as of right
now there is nothing on the market that can transmit an audio signal to the six
speakers that make up a 5.1 system. The technology that consumers are most
familiar with and that manufacturers generally use is Bluetooth, which only
supports two channels. Some of these manufacturers offer 5.1 wireless systems
for PCs, but they just use sound effects to produce what they call virtual 5.1 sound,
which isn't the real thing. To sum up my experience with this, I can say that
people who use their computers to enjoy the excellent 5.1 sound of a movie or song,
or to get into a game where you need to hear what's happening next to you or
behind you, use real 5.1 systems, consisting of a center speaker, two front
side speakers, two rear speakers and a subwoofer. These speakers are arranged
to create true surround sound and they are connected to the PC through
connectors and cables, and not wirelessly. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456192419/eiwniscezpqz3jxxzyap.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 195.244px;height: 157px;""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456192467/pqvfjwhe9tc5zmuysqcg.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 232.308px;height: 110px;background-color: initial;""/>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456192556/cmukwanuwpmcfl0iqahm.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 83.6757px;height: 129px;background-color: initial;""/></p><br/>

<p>Hola a todos, permítanme presentarme, mi nombre es Henry González, de
profesión  Ingeniero Electrónico, nací en
Venezuela  y vivo actualmente en Chicago,
IL, USA.  Me vine a este país para
desarrollar algunas ideas que tengo en mente, ya que también me gusta inventar
cosas, hace unos meses obtuve mi primera patente y se trata del proyecto que
aquí les presento.</p>
<p>El invento lleva por nombre “SWITCH AUDIO PC 5.1” y se trata de un switch
que permite tener dos o más computadoras conectadas a un mismo sistema de audio
y seleccionar que computadora  emitirá el
sonido en determinado momento,  de esta
forma si se tiene por ejemplo, un computador de usos generales  y otra para juegos, no será necesario tener
un sistema de audio para cada uno, como tampoco será necesario desconectar los
altavoces de uno para conectar el otro cada vez que lo requiera, al estar todas
conectadas al SWITCH AUDIO PC 5.1  con
solo oprimir un botón se podrá seleccionar la computadora que queremos escuchar
en los 6 altavoces que componen el sistema 5.1.</p>
<p>Esta campaña es de vital importancia para mí porque estoy dando a conocer
mi invento al mundo, y al ser el primero tiene un mayor significado. Con esta
campaña busco medir el nivel de aceptación y recaudar fondos para una etapa
inicial la cual llamo etapa de desarrollo. </p>
<p>En esta etapa los contribuyentes me ayudaran a desarrollar un modelo físico
que llamaremos “Prototipo B”, el cuál será la base para la siguiente etapa de
fabricación en serie.</p>
<p>Actualmente tengo un prototipo que hice yo mismo, lo usé en mi país antes
de venirme durante tres años y nunca presentó falla alguna, en la foto se puede
ver que es totalmente hecho en casa, análogo y rudimentario, lo llamo
“Prototipo A”. Si logro alcanzar  la meta
estimada esos fondos me permitirán llevar ese rudimentario, análogo y hecho en
casa “Prototipo A” a un bonito, estilizado y digital “Prototipo B”, según el
estimado que tengo, con ese monto cubriré cada una de las fases de la etapa de
desarrollo las cuales son: Research, Sketching Concepts, 3D CAD, Technical
Specs, Prototype, Patent Drawings &amp; Text, Sourcing and Agreement, cada una
de ellas tiene un costo por separado y juntos suman el monto que espero
recaudar, así que todo lo que logre obtener en esta campaña será destinado a
cumplir este objetivo inicial, de no llegar a la meta avanzaré hasta donde los
fondos me permitan y si por el contrario logro recaudar más de lo estipulado
será destinado a la fabricación de las primeras unidades.</p>
<p>Desde que comencé a usar el “Prototipo A”, he preguntado a mucha gente
¿Cuántas computadoras tienes en casa?, las respuestas las he comparado con
foros online de personas que han tenido la misma inquietud, los resultados me
han asombrado y me llevan a la conclusión que, pese al incremento de nuevas
tecnologías como los Smartphones y tablets, las computadoras son una
herramienta primordial en nuestra vida, tanto así que ya es normal ver dos o
más en cada hogar e incluso para un mismo usuario. Algo que llamo mucho mi
atención fue una estadística que publico Intel 
a finales del 2014  donde aseguran
que existen más de 700 millones de PC gamers en el mundo y sé por experiencia
que al ensamblar o comprar una PC con lo último en tecnología para jugar, es
solo para eso, para jugar; por lo que en la mayoría de los casos se requiere de
otra PC de menores prestaciones para las funciones más cotidianas, donde
también mamá busca la receta de cocina y la hermanita oye a Justin Bieber
mientras hace su tarea. </p>
<p>Por otra parte, y pese al avance de la tecnología inalámbrica, no existe hasta
la fecha ninguna que pueda trasmitir una señal de audio a los seis altavoces
que componen un sistema 5.1. La más conocida y empleada por muchos fabricantes
es la tecnología Bluetooth y esta soporta solo dos canales. Algunos de estos
fabricantes ofrecen sistemas 5.1 inalámbricos para las PC, pero son solo
efectos sonoros con el cual dicen conseguir un sonido 5.1 virtual, nada que ver
con la realidad. De esto último puedo resumir 
que las personas que usan sus computadoras para disfrutar del excelente
sonido 5.1 de una película, pieza musical o introducirse en un juego donde se
necesita oír que hay detrás o a los lados; usan altavoces 5.1 reales compuestos
por un altavoz frontal, dos laterales, dos traseros y el subwoofer; todos
dispuestos de tal forma que crean un verdadero sonido envolvente y estos se
conectan a las PC mediante conectores y cables, y no de forma inalámbrica. </p>
<p>Todo lo anterior
me impulsan a llevar a cabo este proyecto con el propósito de poner al SWITCH
AUDIO PC  al alcance de todos estos
usuarios que tienen o necesitan usar dos computadores o más, y a la vez
disfrutan del excelente sonido que un sistema 5.1 real puede ofrecer.</p>
<p></p><p>Te invito a que
participes en este nuevo proyecto, y te invito desde ya, desde antes de su
nacimiento. Tendrás la ventaja única de ser parte de su creación, vas a recibir
información del proceso, vas a estar al tanto de los pasos y objetivos  logrados; y 
podrás ser parte del equipo de trabajo donde tu opinión en cuanto al
diseño, colores, tamaño, forma, etc., será muy importante y tomada en cuenta. Además
podrás tener ofertas únicas solo para esta primera etapa de desarrollo, ya que
todos los descuentos serán calculados sobre el precio de fábrica y no sobre el
precio de venta que tendrá luego.</p>
<p>Cualquier duda,
pregunta, sugerencia, consejo, burla o lo que desee expresar, me pueden
contactar cuando gusten, su opinión será de mucha importancia para mí.  Debo aclarar que todavía no habló ingles con
fluidez, pero si leo y escribo lo suficiente para comunicarme, también las
herramientas de traducción me ayudan en determinado momento, por lo que no será

lo contrario me va a ayudar en el proceso de aprendizaje.</p>
<p> Muchas gracias por visitar mi campaña, mucho
éxito y que tenga un excelente día.</p>
<br/><p></p><p></p><br/></div>","Hello all. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Henry
González, an electronic engineer by profession, born in Venezuela and currently
living in Chicago, IL.  I came to this
country to develop several of my ideas, since I also enjoy inventing. A few months
ago I obtained my first patent, which is for the project I present here.
The invention is called ""SWITCH AUDIO PC 5.1"" and
it is a switch that allows two or more computers to be connected to the same
audio system, and to select which computer will be heard at any given time. So,
for example, if you have a computer for general use and another for gaming, you
will not need an audio system for each, nor will it be necessary to disconnect
the speakers from one to connect the other, since both are connected to the
SWITCH AUDIO PC 5.1. At the touch of a button you can select the computer you
want to hear in the 6 speakers making up the 5.1 system.

In this stage, contributors will help me develop a physical
model we will call ""Prototype B,"" which will be the basis for the
next stage, which is mass production.
I currently have a prototype I built myself. I used it for
three years in my country, before I came here, and it has never malfunctioned
on me. In the photo you can see it is totally homemade, analog and rudimentary.
I call it ""Prototype A."" If I am successful in reaching my estimated
target, the funds will allow me to take this rudimentary, analog and homemade
""Prototype A"" to being a good looking, sleek, digital ""Prototype
B."" According to my estimates, these funds will completely cover the
phases in the development stage, which are: Research, Sketching Concepts, 3D
CAD, Technical Specs, Prototype, Patent Drawings & Text, Sourcing and
Agreement. Each of these phases has its own cost, and they add up to the amount
I hope to raise. So, the funds I raise in this campaign will be used to
complete this initial objective. If I do not reach my target, I will complete
as much as the funds allow me to do, and if instead I raise more than planned,
the additional funds will be used to build the first units.
Since I started using ""Prototype A,"" I have asked
many people: ""How many computers do you have at home?"" The answers I
have received, along with posts I have read on online forums dealing with the
same question, have surprised me, leading me to the conclusion that despite increasingly
prevalent new technologies such as smartphones and tablets, PCs are an
essential tool in our lives, so much so that it is now common to see two or
more in every home and even for a single user. A statistic published by Intel
towards the end of 2014 caught my attention: there are more than 700 million PC
gamers in the world. I know from experience that a PC assembled or purchased
with the latest technology for gaming is really used just for gaming. So, in
most cases, another, less powerful PC is needed for general day-to-day use, and
for mothers to google recipes and sisters to listen to Justin Bieber while
doing their homework. 
Also, despite advances in wireless technology, as of right
now there is nothing on the market that can transmit an audio signal to the six
speakers that make up a 5.1 system. The technology that consumers are most
familiar with and that manufacturers generally use is Bluetooth, which only
supports two channels. Some of these manufacturers offer 5.1 wireless systems
for PCs, but they just use sound effects to produce what they call virtual 5.1 sound,
which isn't the real thing. To sum up my experience with this, I can say that
people who use their computers to enjoy the excellent 5.1 sound of a movie or song,
or to get into a game where you need to hear what's happening next to you or
behind you, use real 5.1 systems, consisting of a center speaker, two front
side speakers, two rear speakers and a subwoofer. These speakers are arranged
to create true surround sound and they are connected to the PC through
connectors and cables, and not wirelessly.             
The above reasons have inspired me to do this project, to
bring the SWITCH AUDIO PC to all those users who have or need to use two or
more computers and who enjoy the excellent sound that a real 5.1 system can
offer.
I invite you to participate in this new project, and I
invite you to do so now, before the product is created. You will have the
unique advantage of being part of its creation; you will receive information
about the process; you will be kept informed of the steps and objectives
achieved; and you will have the opportunity to be part of the team, where your
opinion in terms of design, colors, size, shape, etc., will be very important
and will be taken into account. You will also have access to one-time special
offers for this first stage of development, since all the respective discounts
will be calculated on the factory price and not the retail price.
If you have any questions, concerns, suggestions, advice,
ridicule or anything at all you would like to say, you can contact me whenever
you'd like. Your opinion is very important to me.  I should mention that I do not speak English
fluently, but I read and write sufficiently well to communicate. I also use
translation tools to help when the need arises, and so communicating will not
be a problem; far from it, actually – it will help me in my learning process.TIMELINE

WeeWee Proto Site

What is WeeWeeFree?

WeeWeeFree is a restroom app for iPhone (android will be available in December) that lists free nearby restrooms in major US metropolitan areas (starts from New York City).  WeeWeeFree uses the current location of your mobile device to determine which restrooms are closest to you. WeeWeeFree also includes entertaining features such as jokes and games to read or play.

Why am I doing this?
After I graduated last year, I began searching for an opportunity to apply my hard earned computer science degree to real life, so I decided to stay home and watch TV for the next six months.….
After five months of being a couch potato and having gained 40 pounds, I came across a story on local news, (Read Here) : a 2-Year-Old was fined 50 dollars for public urination. I was furious, went straight to zen-it-off in my toilet bowl, and there it was, my light bulb moment: After hours of Googling and Binging around, public restrooms websites are freaking everywhere (results from binging are actually better! huh, how bout that). They are all very useful, but with one common problem, they look mad BORING….
The big question was, how to make peeing and doo-dooing more interesting? 
Light bulb moment numero dos: how about something funny to read instead of crying about why my roommate is such an @$$#*&~% (means Angel in high Valyrian)…
Here comes the glorious and majestic light bulb numero tres: ….Build the dang App …Duhh… 
What is different about WeeWeeFree?
Not a one way street: It is open to all users to rate the quality of restrooms with non-conventional rating system.

Restroom direction

Filtering options
WeeWee Drop rating:

1 drop: I would rather hold it and take my business somewhere else 
2 drop: Quick in and out.
3 drop: Pretty clean and gets the job done.
4 drop: Feel like home with birds chirping.
5 drop: I would come back with a Jane Austen book!

Not a one-trick pony: WeeWee app has daily jokes and games to pass time while doing your business.


Essentially, we are building something that is FUN and useful!!

<h3>Introducing prch</h3>
<h3>A MODERN SHADE STAND + MORE</h3>
<p>Greetings Crowdfunders,</p>
<p>We're JETPAK and it's finally time to launch our prch to the masses.</p>
<p>We've all got some killer glasses, yet we carelessly toss them on the counter or by our desks without even thinking about it. It's funny how we've all become accustomed to modern desktop organizers for items like pens and paperclips. Yet, to date - nothing has ever addressed the pair of shades pushed back on your head or hanging from your v-neck.</p>

These shades really need a home...so we designed one for them. Taking cues from minimalist design best practices and an appreciation for flowing curves and clean lines - the prch came to life right here in Columbus, Ohio.</div>

<p>To move beyond our 3D printed prototypes, we are looking to raise money here to start a small batch production run using injection molded plastic and a local manufacturer here in Columbus - not China.

The big issue is that sometimes I come up with things that I think have a wide applicability, but it's too costly to build a bunch of widgets up front, where scale can result in greater efficiency.</p>
<p>The problem at hand is the Raspberry Pi power problem. The Raspberry Pi comes with a surface-mount micro-USB socket. You're supposed to connect up a high amperage 5 volt supply to that. There are a variety of problems with this. Among them, the surface mount connector is relatively weak. It's also fiddly (can't rotate the plug), and good quality, high current USB supplies are not always easy to come by (by contrast, crappy ones are common).</p>
<p>Pi Power is a switching DC-DC converter that will accept any DC input voltage from 6 to 15 volts and convert it to up to 2 amps at 5 volts. It connects to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO connector, and comes with a stacking header so you can ""piggyback"" other things (and power them) as well.</p>
<p>Pi Power works with all current models of Raspberry Pis. On the model B units, you can make use of the extra power for USB peripherals. On model A units, to use high powered USB peripherals you still need to either modify your Pi or use a powered hub. On B+ models with the 40 pin GPIO header, you can add a 14 pin stacking header to the bottom of the GPIO header next to Pi Power to raise the complete GPIO header up to the same level, or you can use the 24 pins above PiPower with peripherals that don't use the extra pins.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I want to fund a volume purchase and build of Pi Powers. At this point, I have a working prototype. In fact, I sell them for $15. But each one of those I have to hand-assemble. If you include my time, I'm definitely losing money doing it that way.</p>
<p>Here's what building 1000 of them would cost:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>DigiKey BOM: $3900 (T&amp;R or DigiReel).<br/>
</li>
<li>PCB Fab: $1600 (OSHPark medium-run order for 100 panels of 10 boards)</li>
<li>Stacking headers: $370 (4uconnector)</li>
<li>Assembly: $1410 (Small Batch Assembly)</li>
</ol>
<div>Total: $7280. Total cost per unit: $7.28.</div>
<div>The laws retail pricing say that that's what I have to do to be able to price them at $15.</div>
<p>There's really only one perk on offer here - a Pi Power for $15. Anyone who contributes that or more will get one. They'll be supplied just as they come off the panels, plus a stacking header for you to solder on yourself. If and when 486 people do that, the campaign will be fully funded. From there, Pi Power should be self-sustaining at the thousand-unit per batch level.</p>
<p>My initial estimate on the timing is that from the moment I shout ""Go!"" initial deliveries of the completed product should be within 3 months. I believe the PCB fab requires 4 weeks lead time, and that the assembly does as well. That leaves a month of slack for delays.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I believe Pi Power is a good product. The major reason I am going through this is that I believe large numbers of Raspberry Pi users would buy a Pi Power if they knew about it, and the visibility of the project and the efficiency gains from volume purchasing are the goals here.</p>
<p>With a total investment of $7280, I could build 1000 of them and purchase the parts in whole-reel quantities for maximum savings, and have parts left over on some of the reels to reduce the per-unit costs of the next batch even more.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There's very little risk. I'm building these one-at-a-time right now, I'm just not very efficient at it. If it all falls through, then I just go back to making them by hand in my garage.</p>

<p>• Due to copyright differences between media and item production, the logo for the RackPeace is being updated, and this is how the new logo probably looks.</p>
<p>• The final material’s off-white color may differ  in reality to the pictures and movies due to the difference between simulation and real product. Over time, white rubber colors can change giving it a more natural tone.</p>

<h1>Indiegogo</h1>
<p>What’s so amazing about crowd funding is that it is changing the world. Working out an initial idea and presenting it to the public for funding has never been this way before. Indiegogo's approach of international crowd funding with fixed or flexible funding methods fits to so many more cases. For idea developers this is an ideal platform: work out the idea, present it to a community, prove that there is demand, build the right relationships for manufacturing and shipping, and if the campaign is successful, create the product and deliver it to the people.<a name=""shipping"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>

To keep  shipping distances and costs low,   RackPeaces will be imported to multiple  local warehouse centers in the U.S., Canda, Europe and Asia.  <strong>Please note, shipping costs should NOT be part of your pledge.</strong> We'll inform you of your shipping costs after production of the RackPeace. Click to enlarge the  example matrix of shipping costs on the right, so you have an idea for your destination.</p>
<p>You've may been wondering about the RackPeace bulk sizes of 48, 96, 240 pieces, instead of for  50, 100, 250 pieces. This is because adding those additional pieces, disproportionally scales packing and would cause higher shipping costs for all items in the shipment.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Invoice</h1>
<p>A deductible invoice for your pledge will be enclosed to your shipment. Local sales taxes and / or VAT may occur, which we’d email you for payment, so we can prepare your order accordingly.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Funding Use</h1>
<p>The funding proceeds will be used for production costs including tooling, manufacturing and packaging. Additionally, the funds will be used for shipping to and storing at the fulfillment centers, customs duties, taxes and all other related costs.<br/><br/>
The RackPeace has been developed with the highest quality standards in mind. The prototype has been finalized and the requirements established with the manufacturers and order fulfillers. Now your help is needed to achieve the funds necessary to start the production. Indiegogo pledgers will receive the RackPeace ahead and at a lower price than retail, and will be eligible for later Special Pledger Offers at RackPeace.com. </p>

<h1>Press &amp; Media</h1>
<p>List in progress and to be updated.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><span style=""background-color: #F63; color: #FFF;""> To You </span></h1>
<p>Thank you for checking out the campaign. The RackPeace is a labor of heart. In my little atelier I’m passionate about bringing ideas to life. I design material or immaterial items, create visualization, build prototypes, research and source and  set up funding campaigns. It was a great time working through the RackPeace project with lots of fun and inspirations from many sides, which I hope will be transmitted to you when using your RackPeace.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Spread the Word</h1>
<p>Please help to spread the word. In our online world using social networking to share a campaign has enabled developers like never before to approach and inspire people.</p>
<p>Please take a moment and use the social links below to share the RackPeace campaign with your friends. That would tremendously help this project to succeed.</p>

Feature-Packed Piece
The RackPeace is a rack with thought through features.


The RackPeace is independent of brand/make and fits any smartphone or small tablet. It has a high and wide tray that allows you to place your smart device at a convenient viewing height and at variable viewing angles, either vertically or horizontally.
Its surface around a hard material core, is made from thick, robust and sturdy skateboard wheel rubber for an ideal grip on the table and for your device's great grip on the RackPeace.
The deep crease in the middle fits any current and future charger jack designs and accommodates any kind of device cables with enough space to suit even thick or stiff cables.
You can keep using the RackPeace when your device is wired and cables can be plugged from the top, the side, front or rear whether it is the charging cable, headset, audio or data cable.
The structure of the RackPeace with its pillar fingers, the corrugated tray with stopper nobbles, and the stretched bottom rim in the back, shifts the balance point of the posted smart device to the outer edge of the RackPeace giving your smart device great grip and stability when working on its touchscreen.
The rubber material of the RackPeace is sturdy, tough and long lasting. Its surface can be easily cleaned and keeps its neat appearance for a very long time.
The rubber material prevents your device’s sensitive surface from being scratched. Placing your device on the RackPeace, instead of laying it on the table top, protects it from scratches or even accidental liquid spills.
Because the RackPeace doesn’t have any wired connections, there is no need to plug or unplug it before re-locating.
The RackPeace has a 1/4""-­20 mounting thread at the bottom center, to use your smartphone or tablet with any standard tripod for occasional filming, presentation, picture taking or creating panoramic photos, etc.

• Due to copyright differences between media and item production, the logo for the RackPeace is being updated, and this is how the new logo probably looks.
• The final material’s off-white color may differ  in reality to the pictures and movies due to the difference between simulation and real product. Over time, white rubber colors can change giving it a more natural tone.
• The lettering and logo will be embossed on the rear of the RackPeace.
• A fine beveling is planned to run around all edges, like it is at the bottom.
 
Indiegogo
What’s so amazing about crowd funding is that it is changing the world. Working out an initial idea and presenting it to the public for funding has never been this way before. Indiegogo's approach of international crowd funding with fixed or flexible funding methods fits to so many more cases. For idea developers this is an ideal platform: work out the idea, present it to a community, prove that there is demand, build the right relationships for manufacturing and shipping, and if the campaign is successful, create the product and deliver it to the people.
 
Shipping

To keep  shipping distances and costs low,   RackPeaces will be imported to multiple  local warehouse centers in the U.S., Canda, Europe and Asia.  Please note, shipping costs should NOT be part of your pledge. We'll inform you of your shipping costs after production of the RackPeace. Click to enlarge the  example matrix of shipping costs on the right, so you have an idea for your destination.
You've may been wondering about the RackPeace bulk sizes of 48, 96, 240 pieces, instead of for  50, 100, 250 pieces. This is because adding those additional pieces, disproportionally scales packing and would cause higher shipping costs for all items in the shipment.
 
Invoice
A deductible invoice for your pledge will be enclosed to your shipment. Local sales taxes and / or VAT may occur, which we’d email you for payment, so we can prepare your order accordingly.
 
Funding Use
The funding proceeds will be used for production costs including tooling, manufacturing and packaging. Additionally, the funds will be used for shipping to and storing at the fulfillment centers, customs duties, taxes and all other related costs.
The RackPeace has been developed with the highest quality standards in mind. The prototype has been finalized and the requirements established with the manufacturers and order fulfillers. Now your help is needed to achieve the funds necessary to start the production. Indiegogo pledgers will receive the RackPeace ahead and at a lower price than retail, and will be eligible for later Special Pledger Offers at RackPeace.com. 
 
Press & Media
List in progress and to be updated.
 
 To You 
Thank you for checking out the campaign. The RackPeace is a labor of heart. In my little atelier I’m passionate about bringing ideas to life. I design material or immaterial items, create visualization, build prototypes, research and source and  set up funding campaigns. It was a great time working through the RackPeace project with lots of fun and inspirations from many sides, which I hope will be transmitted to you when using your RackPeace.
 
Spread the Word
Please help to spread the word. In our online world using social networking to share a campaign has enabled developers like never before to approach and inspire people.
Please take a moment and use the social links below to share the RackPeace campaign with your friends. That would tremendously help this project to succeed.

</div></div>","NODZ is the next generation social network. Specifically designed to safeguard our privacy, simply eco-responsible.

Developed by independent minded people for independent minded people. It’s an alternative social platform, powered by Peer-to-Peer distribution and protected by End-to-End Encryption. NODZ offers an affordable, intuitive and eco-responsible solution allowing everyone to share personal memories and communicate without jeopardizing its privacy.PEER-TO-PEER DISTRIBUTIONAt the heart of NODZ is a decentralized network, based on the Torrent Open Source protocol. Thanks to the Peer-to-Peer technology, we bypass immense carbon footprint hungry Data Centers. Your data is stored on your network node, a little device connected to the Internet that you simply keep plugged in to your home network.
Whenever you make a post, the data is sent to your network NODE which then directly distributes the post to the nodes of the members of your community bypassing any unknown intermediary servers.




END-TO-END ENCRYPTIONCryptography is the key element in NODZ network security. We use state-of-the-art symmetric and asymmetric cryptography technics based on Open Source PGP standard to provide true End-to-End Encryption.
All published data is firstly encrypted on your smartphone or tablet, then transmitted via the P2P network and finally decrypted on the mobile device of the members of your community. Meaning that your data is fully encrypted throughout the entire storing and transporting process over the Internet.
There is no need to worry about the encryption and decryption processes, as they are fully automated.








THE APPNODZ is designed to be as simple as possible. Based on a straightforward newsfeed, you will be able to share photos, videos and comments as well as schedule events and communicate with instant messaging.



In order to access the NODZ network, you will need to download a free app for your smartphone or tablet, running iOS or Android.


DATA EXPIRATION & RIGHT TO OBLIVIONBy default, a  post’s life span is 7 days. However, if you benefit from particular attention from your community, your post’s life span will increase.
In addition, you can cancel your user account at any time. This will immediately erase all of your data from the NODZ network.







THE NODEA NODE is a little device connected to the Internet that you simply keep plugged in to your home network. It is your personal micro-server and every member of the NODZ network must have their own or alternatively, run BeagleBone Black Rev. C. Board 100% compatible gear. 
The NODE comes with a 32G microSDHC memory card. It stores, manages and distributes your data to every members of your community. Furthermore, it is equipped with an USB 2.0 Port to which you can plug in an external hard drive to increase your storage capacity.






To bring the best possible product to the market we collaborated with Swiss industrial designer Davide Oppizzi from DCUBE and together we successfully brought the concept to fruition.



The finishing color of the NODE Standard Edition will be voted for by crowdfunding contributors.

THE  MAIN BOARDObviously, we have opted for Open Hardware technology since its development is shared and supported by a large passionate community worldwide.




We entrusted the production of the main board to our Swiss partner Gigatec S.A. who specializes in development and production of cutting-edge technologies.
Our customized main board is based on the open specifications of the BeagleBone Black Board Revision C. from the BeagleBone.org foundation. However, the specifications are accessible to all, so you could build your own “hacker style” in your garage.

<i>It's
 been a long road for BearTek and we reached $60,000 in our campaign 
which was well above our goal!  Most of that was within the first 5 days
 of the campaign.  However, additional challenges have come up where we 
have to take BearTek into hibernation for a little while until we find 
the right partners/investors to help take this to the next level and 
beyond. <br/><br/></i><p><i>We want to be as transparent with this campaign, and true to our last 4 years of delivering a great 
product and making deliriously happy customers. Stay tuned as you should
 not be surprised to see BearTek resurface shortly stronger than ever,</i></p>
<p><i>In
 the meantime, we have processed refunds for all the contributions on the campaign so no one will be charged until we are sure we can deliver as 
promised.</i></p>
<p><i>Stay tuned - Team BearTek!</i></p>

your fingers together. And, that’s not all... Gen II also provides developers
with the freedom to customize BearTek remote control gloves to control any App,
device, machinery or piece of equipment. Now that’s a SMART glove that gives

 been a long road for BearTek and we reached $60,000 in our campaign 
which was well above our goal!  Most of that was within the first 5 days
 of the campaign.  However, additional challenges have come up where we 
have to take BearTek into hibernation for a little while until we find 
the right partners/investors to help take this to the next level and 
beyond. We want to be as transparent with this campaign, and true to our last 4 years of delivering a great 
product and making deliriously happy customers. Stay tuned as you should
 not be surprised to see BearTek resurface shortly stronger than ever,
In
 the meantime, we have processed refunds for all the contributions on the campaign so no one will be charged until we are sure we can deliver as 
promised.
Stay tuned - Team BearTek!

<p><span>About Labx</span></p>
<p>Labx is a design company focused on innovative, beautifully crafted products. We are on a mission to create happy, meaningful lives for the people that everyday carry.</p>
<p>The origin of Labx comes from Ryan---the founder of Labx. Like many people who work at a desk, Ryan suffers from Spondylodynia – pain in the vertebra of the spine caused by working for long periods of time in uncomfortable positions. In fact, with one’s head angled at 30°, the spine will suffer from pressure equivalent to 18 kg. With one’s heads at 60°, the spine will suffer from pressure that is equivalent to 27 kg.</p>
<p>However, if the workstation screen can be raised and placed at the proper viewing angle, it will effectively relieve pressure on the spine. Although there are all kinds of laptop stands on the market, there aren't many products that can act as both a laptop stand and sleeve in one.

</div></div>","Labx is transcending the traditional laptop sleeve with an innovative 3-in-1 design. It provides the safety and protection of a sleeve, the ergonomy of a laptop stand, and a look that lets you commute in style.  Labx greatly improves the user experience while working with a laptop. It provides comfortable viewing and typing angles by raising the laptop and helps to effectively relieve the pressure on the cervical vertebra that results from uncomfortable working angles.
 
 
Designed with a sleek and foldable structure, Labx can be folded up into a stand from a laptop sleeve in literally one second. The stand raises your laptop for a better viewing and typing angle.  How to Turn Labx Sleeve into A Stand 
 

 Hands On Review
Check this unbiased Labx Hands-on Review from OSReview. Thanks so much for his awesome work!
 
 Unique Structure for Both Laptop and Surface
Featuring a unique solid architectural structure, Labx can be used for laptops and surfaces in completely different ways.

 
The Most Sleek Laptop Sleeve You’ve Ever Seen
Labx is supremely sleek, has a modern aesthetic, and is perfect for daily commuting.
 
  

Labx fits all laptops and tablets on the market. It can be used in any location such as the office, home, library, cafe or on the go. You can even use it to create a comfortable workstation on the couch or in bed without carrying an extra stand.
 
 
 
 
 
 

Architectural Structure
Featuring a sturdy triangle structure, Labx is stable enough to support your devices up to 6kg, providing a comfortable typing experience that keeps your laptop securely in place while working.
 
 
 
Supreme Soft-touch Feeling
Thanks to its ultra-smooth inner microfiber material, the interior has a soft-touch feel and protects your laptop from scratches. By using a high-quality PU leather, it’s more eco-friendly and sustainable than traditional animal leather. Labx is also waterproof so you can safely travel in any weather.
 
 
Magnetic Closure Design
To keep your laptop secure inside the sleeve, there is a magnetic closure at the top. It also helps to maintain support of your laptop when you fold the sleeve to transform it into a stand.  
 
 Adjustable angle for Various Devices

Labx boosts your comfort and productivity with three adjustable angles. You can choose to put your surface pro in a different angle you like.

 
 

 
 
 
  
  
 

 
 

About Labx
Labx is a design company focused on innovative, beautifully crafted products. We are on a mission to create happy, meaningful lives for the people that everyday carry.
The origin of Labx comes from Ryan---the founder of Labx. Like many people who work at a desk, Ryan suffers from Spondylodynia – pain in the vertebra of the spine caused by working for long periods of time in uncomfortable positions. In fact, with one’s head angled at 30°, the spine will suffer from pressure equivalent to 18 kg. With one’s heads at 60°, the spine will suffer from pressure that is equivalent to 27 kg.
However, if the workstation screen can be raised and placed at the proper viewing angle, it will effectively relieve pressure on the spine. Although there are all kinds of laptop stands on the market, there aren't many products that can act as both a laptop stand and sleeve in one. As a result, Ryan decided to design an innovative product that cleverly combines the two together--Labx.",34.0,2,"1 Campaign

But most of the times these moments don't last long, by the time we walk back to our office or library desk we realize that our beverage has gotten cold. And what's more unpleasant than the bitter taste of coffee when it gets cold?MEET LAVACLIP
LAVACLIP is a revolutionary coffee warmer that will re-define our drinking coffee experience. It is designed to attach to the bottom of most paper cups and heats your beverage using rechargeable batteries. With an advanced clipping mechanism in place, LAVACLIP attaches to the bottom of various paper cup sizes while the heater is in direct contact with the bottom surface of the cup. Because of its light weight, LAVACLIP stays attached to the bottom of your cup while you walk around, run errands, shop, along performing other activities.The micro-USB port enables you to charge LAVACLIP using any standard USB outlet whether that's your laptop, PC or you cellphone charger. Among all the devices that keep beverages warm, LAVACLIP is the only one that is portable and rechargeable and made specifically for beverages served in paper cups.Wait, your taste buds react to different temperatures?In a recent study, scientists discovered how taste receptors inside our taste buds react to molecules at different temperatures.The research has found that ""certain taste receptors are most sensitive to food molecules that are in the 20 to 35 degree Celsius, in other words, molecules that are at or just above room temperature. The taste receptors in question don’t always register molecules that are much hotter or colder than this range, and thus we don’t taste them.They concluded that ""hot coffee around 60-70 degree Celsius range may seem less bitter than room-temperature coffee because our bitter taste receptors aren’t as sensitive to bitter molecules in the coffee when those molecules are hot. Ofcourse, the same goes for other hot beverages.""  
Existing beverage warmers consist of a wide flat hot plate surface which is not suitable for paper cups. Due to the elevated base of paper cups, the heater won't be in direct contact with the bottom surface. Hence, resulting in ineffective heat transfer and failing to keep beverages warm. 
USB Beverage WarmerOn the other hand, electric mugs can only be used to heat up beverages that are served in them. For the 'to go' coffee buyers, this leaves us with no option but to carry a bulky device with us wherever we go, not to mention that we'd need to wash it after each and every use.
We addressed all of the above problems by creating LAVACLIP. A portable & rechargeable coffee warmer designed specifically for ""to-go"" cups. With it's elevated heating plate, accustomed to fit cups of various sizes, LAVACLIP maximizes the amount of heat transferred to the beverage.FEATURES
LAVACLIP is so light that you'd barely notice that it's attached to the bottom of your disposable cup.At less than 3"" tall, LAVACLIP packs easily in a purse, backpack or carry-on bag so you never have to worry about your beverage getting cold. For working professionals, you can always keep it in your office on your desk.LAVACLIP makes drinking your Mocha, Hot Chocolate, Latte, Coffee, & Tea beverage more enjoyable. You no longer need to chug on your drink just so you can catch up with your drink getting cold.And it’s particularly a great accessory to have in the winter; a beverage warmer would certainly come in handy!
Some of us may want to enjoy our hot beverage for a much longer time before the battery drains. Which is why we introduced LAVACLIP Premium. With a built-in wireless receiver accompanied with a custom-made wireless charger that uses a standard USB port, you can simply place your cup of hot beverage & LAVACLIP on top of the wireless charger, so that your battery is continuously being charged while you sip on your hot beverage. 






PREMIUM: WIRELESS CHARGING

$500K MILESTONE! Whether you'll be placing LAVACLIP in your purse or carry-on bag. A pouch will protect it from scratches and will keep it clean.

We can’t wait to deliver LavaClip but there are inherent challenges in building hardware. Though we've been methodical in our design process, have built and tested several prototypes, and believe our timeline is realistic, we won’t ship LAVACLIP until it meets our high quality standards.LavaClip team benefits from experts in the field of heat transfer and experienced designers to bring the final product to perfection. The efficiency of the heater used in our product has been optimized while keeping the product's weight minimal. Lavaclip is waterproof and heat resistant, and has been tested in our labs against accidental coffee spills. The amount of heat needed to keep the coffee warm at optimal drinking temperature have been meticulously measured in different ambient temperatures and conditions.

HOW WE GOT HEREWe went through tens of different sketches and selected a few for rapid prototyping. Among all the tested prototypes, we have chosen the perfect design which is not just a functional product but is so eye catching that you would love to carry it wherever you go!

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Why is this campaign US only?</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to telecommunication hardware (mobile phones), most countries have their own regulatory bodies that must approve each product. This approval process is costly, and as a small startup, we can only afford to enter one country at a time. Since we're based in the US, it only makes sense we start here.</p>
<p>Also, if we start selling internationally, it will be very hard to provide sufficient customer support across different regions and languages.</p>
<p>If you would like to see the V1SION in your country, please let us know. If we receive enough interest to provide a dedicated regional support team, we will expand accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Why is there sales tax?</strong></p>
<p>Every Indiegogo campaign that gives contributors a product or service as a perk will be subject to regional tax laws. Most perks already include this tax bundled within the price of the product or service. Why are we taking sales tax separately? Couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Regional sales tax differs substantially, and because we make so little on each phone, we can't bundle the cost of the tax in our price and hope it's enough to cover the overall cost of delivering the phone.</li>
<li>We want to provide our potential-contributors with a clear comparison between our phone's pre-tax price versus other devices on the market. </li>
</ol><p><strong>How much will I have to pay for sales tax, and when do I pay?</strong></p>
<p>Since we're based in California, we will collect sales tax on devices shipped to a California address. How much you pay for sales tax varies depending on where you live. We will let you know what your tax is and collect it before we ship the phone.</p>
<p>Remember, sales tax is calculated as a percentage of the final price - not necessarily what you contribute up-front. Unless of course you're receiving a perk with a guaranteed price.</p>
<p><strong>Is $299 the floor price?</strong></p>
<p>Nope! Once we approach 10,000 units, we will renegotiate prices with our manufacturer and suppliers for a better price.</p></div>","Capturing the individual spirit...

<p>Using standard Wi-Fi technology, your smart phone or tablet screen is displayed on TV via MirrorBox without the need for cables stretching across your room. Furthermore, IEEE 802.11 n can improve network throughput over the two previous standards with a significant increase in the maximum net data rate from 54 Mbit/s to 300 Mbit/s, which largely optimizes data input and output.</p>
<h1><strong>Operating range up to 16.4 feet (5 meters)</strong></h1>
<p>This gives you the freedom to pick out a comfortable place where you sit in front the TV.</p>
<h1><strong>Compact and light design</strong></h1>
<p>You might need to do the presentation in different places. MirrorBox was so small you could pop it in your pocket, simply plug the dongle to the projection system and do your presentation from your phone.</p>

<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p><strong>Why we made this?</strong></p>
<p>Dating back to 2008, we feel it’s quite inconvenient to switch over computers when we are having meetings, so the idea to connect note with projector runs into our mind. </p>
<p>Through a period of hard working, based on Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g and Sigma Design platform, we finished a prototype of this product with VGA, CVBS interface. It can transmit the whole image of Windows desktop to remote projector, play low-definition video stream, and display text and image content. This prototype shown as below:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In 2009, 802.11n has become the mainstream. Based on 802.11 n，we improved the transmission quality by connecting FPGA and RGMI Interface directly. Thanks to this improvement, we can transfer data with high performance, with HDMI interface videos and music can transmit at same time. Simply connect to HDMI, your PC’s screen can directly mirror to the wall with 1080p HD, you can also transmit your game images with low delay (about 200ms), it looks like this:</p>

<p>We start to develop on Android platform at year 2011. Until the end of 2012, Android 4.2 debuted, it helped us successfully make Miracast Receiver come into being. By the means of accelerating GPU in ARM Cortex A9, we optimize H.264 to reduce the time for delay on a large scale, achieving the goal of playing smooth APP games on HDTV. All above eventually formed what MirroBox is today:</p>

<p>Our team members have been focusing on developing wireless products for over five years. The experiences in video coding and decoding algorithm have brought us awards in the startup contests. Thanks to Miracast and the hardware upgrade, we have successfully updated previous projects in a few months, so that MirrorBox could have excellent multi-screen interaction under the Miracast framework. This simple box will bring the power of Android to living rooms everywhere. Now that we have completed prototype and the final design, including a fascinating shell of MirrorBox, our team hopes to raise funds to put MirrorBox into massive production so that more people could enjoy the endless fun brought by our product. </p>
<h1>Production Plan</h1>
<p>We have selected a manufacturer with good capacity and quality in Shenzhen, China. We feel confident for an August 2013 ship date.</p>

</div></div>","What is MirrorBox?
MirrorBox is a portable and low-cost device that lets you wirelessly echo the display from a Miracast-ready Android phone or tablet onto your HDTV, bringing you the fun of multi-screen interaction with super smooth animation. 
You can browse the Internet, play your favorite online videos, and enjoy a slide show of your photos wirelessly on your big screen TV. In this case our phone/tablet will be used as a remote controller. This will improve the visual user experience of mobile devices a lot. It is perfect for older TV’s that no Internet and USB port ready. All you need is a TV with HDMI input and you are good to go for a wonderful journey.



Miracast Supported
MirrorBox supports the Miracast standard that is a very recent open standard form of wireless screencast. The most outstanding feature of Miracast is its mirror function like apple AirPlay Mirroring. With it, not only the videos and music from your phone or tablet, but also the complete screen can be mirrored to the HDTV, which makes it possible to play App games from your phone or tablet on TV.

 


Low Delay
No matter you are a hardcore or a casual game player, the most frustrated thing must be the continuous delays. When the delay is over 300ms, it is hardly for you to continue with the game. Now it’s time to say goodbye to them. We optimized the H.264 standard to make sure MirrorBox can perform fantastic real time transmission. This guarantee an awesome game playing experience.

 



Hi-quality transmission
MirrorBox is able to transmit the content up to 1080p HD.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIl2mMtQLCU
No extra software needed
Simply connecting the MirrorBox with your HDTV, after a quick setup on your phone/tablet, you can play fast-action games from your phone/tablet on HDTV and enjoy it as smooth as you want.
 



Browse the Internet and play your favorite online videos
When you come across an awesome video on the web, don’t let yourself end up staring at the smaller screen. MirrorBox allows you to navigate a web page. You can plop down on the couch, turn on the TV and spend the long day on a soap opera.

Wi-Fi supports for IEEE 802.11 b/g/n
Using standard Wi-Fi technology, your smart phone or tablet screen is displayed on TV via MirrorBox without the need for cables stretching across your room. Furthermore, IEEE 802.11 n can improve network throughput over the two previous standards with a significant increase in the maximum net data rate from 54 Mbit/s to 300 Mbit/s, which largely optimizes data input and output.
Operating range up to 16.4 feet (5 meters)
This gives you the freedom to pick out a comfortable place where you sit in front the TV.
Compact and light design
You might need to do the presentation in different places. MirrorBox was so small you could pop it in your pocket, simply plug the dongle to the projection system and do your presentation from your phone.
