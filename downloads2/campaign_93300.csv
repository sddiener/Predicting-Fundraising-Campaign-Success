about, then?</b></p>
<p>As the MM romance genre has grown over the past few years,
so has the demand for stock imagery to be used in cover art. </p>
<p>One of the main problems we all face as authors is that
dreaded moment when we look at a cover spec sheet and realise our dream cover
is never going to happen, because there simply isn’t any stock photography of
two (or more!) men together in a romantic or intimate pose. </p>
<p>The project aims to plug this gap in the market and create a
bank of stock photographs. We don’t want hundreds of images of buff guys with
their shirts off – the plan is to have a very broad range of looks, ages, and
ethnicities, in both a studio setting and “on location”. </p>
<p>As well as providing images to the MM romance novel
industry, we think there’s a market to sell these photographs to LGBT
charities, magazines, websites, newspapers internationally, non-fiction and
educational books… there’s really a very broad scope that we aim to target.</p>
<p><b>Okay, I’m interested.
Why should I give you my hard-earned money?</b></p>
<p>If you’ve ever looked at a cover spec sheet and sighed,
knowing that the perfect image to convey the romance in your story just doesn’t
exist – well, this is your chance to change that. You can choose to purchase
credits which can be cashed in for actual pictures. Or, if you know what you
want and have the cash to spare, you can commission photographs to your exact
specifications. Tell us you want a red-headed guy kissing a dark-skinned man,
and we can make that happen.</p>
<p><b>I’m not quite
convinced.</b></p>
<p>No problem. Give us ten bucks and you’ll get access to a
locked tumblr account, meaning you can browse the photos at your leisure and
let us know if there’s an image you want to purchase.</p>
<p><b>Okay, what will that
cost me?</b></p>
<p>Between $50 and $150, depending on the picture.</p>
<p><b>Bloody hell! That’s a
lot more than most stock photos!</b></p>
<p>Yes. There’s a premium involved for how specific this
project is, and because, frankly, there isn’t much (if any) stock photos out
there of gay men in romantic poses. As we build up the bank of images we hope
to be able to offer bundles and deals – you’ll be able to buy five, ten,
twenty-five credits for a fixed price.</p>
<p><b>Well, how do you know
what authors want?</b></p>
<p>Because I am one. Because I’ve been in that position,
knowing that even though MM romance is a huge industry and growing rapidly,
there isn’t any stock photography that accurately depicts my characters and
their relationship. </p>
<p>Because I’ve talked to them, my colleagues and peers, and
asked them what it is they’re looking for that they can’t get from the existing
stock photography sites.</p><p>If you want to weight in and share your opinion, there's a Survey Monkey now live - please do share your thoughts! We are definitely looking to take on board as much feedback as possible. <a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/ZHT2NXF"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/ZHT2NXF</a></p>
<p><b>Who else is involved?</b></p>
<p>I’m working with the main Gay/LGBT romance publishers to
establish their needs and to make those critical connections. I’ve got a
fantastic Marketing and Social Media manager on board who I have a lot of faith in. I’m currently interviewing photographers to make sure they’re
not going to turn up to a shoot and squick out when they find out what we want
to do. A website is currently under design and we’re looking to launch
branding, the website, and an advertising campaign in due course.</p>
<p><b>How much money are you
going to be making out of this?</b></p>
<p>One of the things that is important to me in this project is
that everyone gets paid. We are all aware of the horror stories in the creative
sector where people are expected to work for free – this isn’t going to be one of
those projects. I want to make sure the models, photographers, marketing
manager and creative director all get paid for their time and work.</p>
<p><b>What happens if you
make more than the target?</b></p>
<p>If we make more than the $4k at the top of the page it’ll all
get re-invested back into the project. That means more models, more studio
time, more variety for the end consumer (ie, you.)  We’ve got a projected breakdown of costs (see
below) and we do raise over and above our target, investing in models is going
to be my main priority. The more models we have, the more options we have, and
more options means a more diverse bank of photographs.</p>
<p><b>Uh,  I think the covers of a lot of MM romance
covers are pretty good, actually. You’re rude.</b></p>
<p>There’s MM romance covers out there that are stunning,
please don’t misunderstand me. I have covers that I wouldn’t change even if you
paid me. The cover artists working in this genre do amazing things with, let’s
face it, not very much to work from. Nor am I trying to put the drawn cover
artists out of business. </p>
<p>What I want is for us to have the option – if we so wish –
to have the sort of covers that are considered normal, even boring, in the M/F
romance world. Pictures of men <i>interacting</i>
with each other. </p>
<p><b>Tell me more about these
models, then…</b></p>
<p>To be honest, the number and quality of models we can hire
on the initial shoot completely depends on how much money we raise. I’d like to
start out with a minimum of six models – if they all work with each other, that
means we get 20 couple combinations. If I can get ten models, we get 45 couple
combinations. Add throuples in there, too, plus “secondary” imagery (think
hands, feet, headless torsos, backs, arms, holding hands – basically anything
that doesn’t show faces) and we’re going to start out with a massive variety of
images from the first weekend of shooting alone. </p>
<p>In my ideal, dream world, we’d hire professional models from
an agency. However, the cost of doing this is enormous, and unless we totally
smash the fundraising target, that’s not going to happen. So, my plan is to
scout models locally. </p>
<p>I live and work in Bristol, England, right in the middle of
the city’s “gay district” Old Market (coincidence, I promise). I feel fairly
confident I can find half a dozen or more attractive gay men who would be
willing to strip off and get cosy with each other in return for a reasonable
fee.</p>
<p><b>I like the sound of
this but man, I’m broke.</b></p>
<p>My friend, we’ve all been there. Donations start from a
dollar – everything helps! You can help by sharing this on
social media – the more people that know about it, the more chance we have of
succeeding. Then you win anyway, because the options I talked about earlier now
exist. </p>

<p></p>
<p>After a lot of thought and prayer, I have registered to fly to Washington state this summer for something called the Delight Retreat. Let me explain a little! :) Delight is a ministry that is very dear to my heart and something i've been involved with for over 2 years. Delight is a community of young women all pursuing Jesus and the creative arts (whether it be photography, graphic design, painting, or culinary!) Delight was founded by Kristin Wall (and is now run by her and several other amazing, Godly leaders) and her goal is to help us grow in our relationship with Jesus while also growing in our skill and building relationships with other girls all over the country who have similar interests. This ministry has blessed me SO much over the past several years - I have learned so much more about photography and how to better develop my business (as well as gotten awesome feedback many times). But even more than that, I've been able to connect with some of the most amazing women all over the country and they've encouraged me, challenged me, and helped me grow in the Lord. It's been incredible. </p>
<p>This retreat is an incredible opportunity to learn from others and better develop my skills (there will be 24 other girls there and many of them are photographers!!), but it will also be an amazing time to grow personally and experience Jesus in the gorgeous setting of Washington State. </p>
<p>I would like to ask you to please consider supporting me in this learning opportunity! My goal is to raise $1,000 dollars by March 1st to cover the remaining expenses. If you can't support me financially, I would be so very grateful for your support in prayer. Thank you so much! xoxo Micaela </p>
<p>If you want to learn more about this ministry check out their website here! <a href=""http://www.delightandbe.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.delightandbe.com</a> - God is doing amazing things through this. :)</p> </div> <div> <h3>Where the money will go:</h3> <p>The $1,000 will be used to cover the rest of the expenses for the retreat/travel. I need another $400 to finish paying for the retreat itself and then I will have to purchase a plane ticket to WA state and check a bag which is where the rest of the money will go.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I have been running my own photography studio since 2007. In that time, I have gained extensive knowledge of everything photography. The only thing I need now is the most important: your support. 2012 is going to be the year that I truly take off and become a huge success, but I can't do that without the help of generous folks like yourself. You can help me fulfill my dreams by contributing in any way you can (even the smallest contribution makes a huge difference!)</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have a unique and inspired vision that I can spread to the world. Through my photography, I bring to life the true beauty of our planet and the diverse people and critters that inhabit it. This coming year is the time when I am going to bring my photography to the next level and spread it on a global scale. Imagine you are looking for a photographer for a wedding or for professional photos of your first child, would you want the same old boring style or would you want a truly unique experience that you can cherish for years to come? </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $5000. All contributions will be used solely for improving my company (purchasing more equipment and spreading the word about my photography across multiple markets). Even the smallest contribution will help in some way, so don't feel like you have to contribute a lot in order to make a difference. Even if I don't meet my monetary goal, I will still be using the donations to better my company.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For what you get, see the Perks below.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand the situation of the world we live in today, so even if you can't contribute any money to my cause, you can still spread the word about my photography. You can post about my work on Facebook, MySpace, or Twitter. If you know someone who is in need of a skilled, professional photographer, send them my way! Again, anything helps my cause a great deal! </p>

<p>PANELS set the stage for your creativity. Pick and choose background and floor sheets that take your photos to brand new levels of expression and showmanship.</p>
<p>Simply insert the PANEL Base into your SHOTBOX and lift the back PANEL into place. Now choose your desired custom-sized Prints to build your scene. The base PANELS are magnetic so you can easily keep the back Print in place with the included magnets. Once the prints are in place, you're ready to stage with objects and props. This is where it gets fun. Let your imagination run wild! Impress your clients, customers, and friends with your unique creativity.</p>
<p>Prints are custom-sized and we'll include 8 select images in the Essential Kit.</p>

still have yet to find closure to their loss.  My goal is that this project raises awareness and raises the
need to find closure.
 
Your
contribution?
In an effort
to reach my goals, I am hoping to raise $5,500 to help put exhibitions in US,
Bosnia, and Canada. The money raised from this campaign will directly support
the exhibition of this project.
 
This is a big
goal. But I’m a believer. And with your help it will be easier. So help me
reach my goal.  Spread the word about this video. Share it with your
friends.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>How did I get to be here asking for your help</h3>
<p>For the past few years, I have been photographing small islands. The project is self-funded and over the years I have accumulated a solid body of work that now needs to see the light of day. Islands are often described as fragile and vulnerable. That is true only to a point. Islands and islanders are also very resilient, adaptive and immensely adept at finding new modes of survival in difficult circumstances. In the work I am planning to exhibit soon, I tried to capture some of those qualities in photographs of island landscapes. I will be starting work on the next phase of the project this summer. What I need your help with is the upcoming series of exhibits. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While magazines and on-line publications are a good way to show one's work, in photography, the actual final product of the photographic process is a print. In our visually saturated culture, there is an ever smaller number of people who get to see photographs as prints. I have been invited to exhibit at an international conference on islands in St. John's, Newfoundland, this October (<a href=""http://www.naf2011.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">http://www.naf2011.com</a>) and at an exhibition space owned by the City of Saint John in New Brunswick. I am also hoping to arrange exhibits on Change Islands and on Fogo Island in Newfoundland, on Grand Manan Island in New Brunswick and on Vis Island in Croatia. I believe that it is very important to share my work with those who made it possible for me to create it by imagining and creating the landscapes and places I have photographed over the years. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Making prints of a sufficient quality for an exhibit is a very expensive endeavour. The cost of good, fiber-based photographic paper alone is in hundreds of dollars. Renting adequate darkroom facilities is also quite expensive. And, if you ever tried to get a professional framing job done on a 16x20 or even 14x17 inch print, you know how expensive matting and simplest of frames can be. Your contributions will cover the production expenses for the exhibit. They will not cover the cost of my time, subsistence or anything along those lines. I am raising money so that I can spend some time printing in adequate facilities and with adequate supplies of photographic paper and chemicals. At the end of the day, I am hoping for a collection of professionally framed prints that you would be happy to hang on the wall of your living room. </p>
<p>And that is why I am giving the prints out as incentives. They will be just as high quality as the stuff hanging at the exhibits, but also at about half the price I would usually sell them for. For example, an unframed 11x14 fiber-based, handmade silver print is normally $300. You can have it for as little as $150.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Money is important, but it's not the only way to help. Spread the word. Ask your friends to pitch in. Say ""Hi!"" if you see me on the street. </p>
<p>If you live in St. John's and have darkroom facilities you'd like to share, get in touch. That would be just as valuable as any cash donation. If you own a framing business and are willing to consider a discount - that would be amazing. If you know that the company you work for would like a print in exchange for financial support, I would be happy to oblige. If you think of something I haven't thought of, send me an e-mail.</p>
<p>If you are an editor interested in publishing a story around this work - and paying for it ;) - that would be fantastic, too. </p>

Journey to discover, celebrate and share the stories of strong, inspiring women through photography.
When you look in the mirror, what do you see?
As a photographer, I am passionate about helping others to recognize the truest depths of their beauty, inside and out.
So often I have gorgeous and powerful women in front of me who are blind to their unique beauty. Sometimes they wear veils; other times masks. Yet all are carrying some distorted view of reality whereas their personal image is concerned.




I have launched this page to raise funds for Project Discovering Wings: A Journey to Discover, Celebrate and Share Stories of Strong, Inspiring Women Through Photography.
The idea behind this project was born out of watching my mother work her entire life, 2-3 jobs at a time, caring for everybody except herself. Now I want to honor her and all the women in the world who are caretakers and may not take the time to pamper themselves, self indulge or feel like they matter. 
Every photo session will be offered at zero-cost to the participants. I am seeking funding to cover the costs associated with the shoots, equipment, insurance, and related road travel from New York City to California and back. 
On the road, I will have the assistance of someone who will not only record the journey for each of you to see watch throughout the trip, but will also assist me with all aspects of the personal photo shoots.

Every amount helps and ensures you can help make a difference in another’s life.
Every woman's experience can affect the future of every female in her family. This could be a catalyst transformation and it starts with just one person.
Good karma to everybody involved!

<p><span></span></p>
<p>During several  years I've been photographing sleeping parents-to-be in Russia to complete a project called ""Waiting"". Being a documentary photographer, in 2009 - 2012 I worked in a rescue division and quite often photographed a lot of horrible things: car crashes, injuries, fires, big and small catastrophes. Most of the ""Waiting"" series was done during these years, and although I started it because of a very different reason (<i>see a  video and a ""Fairytale"" below</i>), this project became a very important ""life"" parallel to my main documentary work at that time. </p>
<p><span>""Waiting"" series took part in many exhibitions worldwide, was published in a lot of magazines, spread around the internet in many countries — and finally will be published as a book! This campaign is an opportunity to support the publication and pre-order the book that you'll get by July 2015!</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>

</div><h3><span>A fairytale about five years of ""Waiting"", spiderman photographer and Masha, who forgot to tell her husband</span></h3><h4><b>Chapter one, where you'll find out about the ""end of era""</b></h4><p><b></b></p><p style=""display: inline !important;""></p><p><span>This project started from a photograph that was made almost by accident: I took a picture of my sleeping friends who at that moment were expecting their daughter to be born in one month.

<p></p>
<p><span>After making several photographs of my friends I switched to their friends, and when there were no more pregnant people around - I started to look for expecting families in different social networks. I would say it was the most difficult part. I sent hundreds and hundreds of letters asking: ""can I photograph you sleeping?"" and in 99%  the reply was: ""you're insane!"". Very often people thought I'm going to steal something, or I want to show ""Russian people from a bad perspective"" (this is still a big mystery to me) or they were sure I'm going to damage their ceiling by installing a camera to it. But almost from the very beginning I had a goal to photograph 40 couples resembling 40 weeks in pregnancy and will not stop unless I make it. I was lucky to find really open minded people who would agree not only to let a stranger into a house, but also to stay asleep while this stranger is climbing the ladder, making noise, holding a camera right over their heads and — waiting.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>I would say this is the most anxious part — to be in a room with sleeping people, waiting — and this is also a huge part of ""Waiting"" — for a couple to turn, waiting for a blanket to move from a belly, waiting for them to wake up after the shoot, when you drink coffee in the kitchen (that was thoughtfully left for you beforehand), being not really sure if they heard you, if they know it is over.</span></p>

<p><span>In spite of the fact that everything looks so easy: find a family, come to their house either at night or early in the morning, climb the ladder and shoot — the whole process includes a lot of danger. </span></p>
<p>Danger one: heaviness. Monopod, camera, remote control device — all together they weigh several kilograms. If you don't do special arm workout — which I don't do — then holding it right above someone's bed for a long time is totally not possible. You start sweating like hell, your elbows curve in unexpected directions and your legs tremble like in cartoons. If you only imagine what happens if you drop all these equipment on innocent sleeping people — the trembling goes away under the pressure of responsibility. But no longer than for one minute.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Danger two: pets. Just think about it: a lot of people have cats. You can find them in many photographs from the project — they are resting somewhere around the bed, either between legs or on someone's belly. They create this special touchy atmosphere and raise the “'Awwww!” in an occupied room. But sometimes you don't know what happens after the shot is done, or just before it. Some pets (not understanding what’s happening up there) become very protective and start fighting with the camera, with the photographer or with the ladder. I lost several times to fights with cats, dogs and even one ferret. </span></p>

<p><span><span>And danger three: bad memory. Once I made an agreement with a pregnant lady that I will come to photograph her with her husband early in the morning. She opened the door for me, showed where to find  tea and went back to sleep. After half an hour waiting I entered the room, climbed the huge ladder that lead me almost to 3,5 meter high ceiling and started to shoot. At some point, the husband, sleeping peacefully nuzzling his pillow just before I started pressing the shutter, opened one eye, then the another one. There was  real fear in his eyes. I think at this moment there was something even more terrifying on my face, because I had no idea what to do: to run or to explain. Staring at me, he touched his wife's arm, asking: ""Masha, who is this?"". Masha was not surprised at all, she said with a sleepy voice: ""It's a photographer, darling, go back to sleep"". And ""darling"" turned around and fell asleep. Later I found out that he never recalled this situation, being sure it was just a dream.</span></span></p>

<p><span>And the main question — what is it all about?

We 144% DID IT!!!!!!!!!!Thank you everybody for all your help and support!! Big update is coming soon!!!""Waiting"" photobook. The sleep of parents-to-be

During several  years I've been photographing sleeping parents-to-be in Russia to complete a project called ""Waiting"". Being a documentary photographer, in 2009 - 2012 I worked in a rescue division and quite often photographed a lot of horrible things: car crashes, injuries, fires, big and small catastrophes. Most of the ""Waiting"" series was done during these years, and although I started it because of a very different reason (see a  video and a ""Fairytale"" below), this project became a very important ""life"" parallel to my main documentary work at that time. 
""Waiting"" series took part in many exhibitions worldwide, was published in a lot of magazines, spread around the internet in many countries — and finally will be published as a book! This campaign is an opportunity to support the publication and pre-order the book that you'll get by July 2015!




A fairytale about five years of ""Waiting"", spiderman photographer and Masha, who forgot to tell her husbandChapter one, where you'll find out about the ""end of era""This project started from a photograph that was made almost by accident: I took a picture of my sleeping friends who at that moment were expecting their daughter to be born in one month. To make this photograph early in the morning I had to climb a ladder that was standing right near their bad, symbolizing the remodeling they were doing getting the flat ready for the child. Here I must say that 2009 was a very difficult year for me — suddenly all of my friends became involved one way or the other in the ""expecting"" process, and all of our conversations got this special ""parent"" flavour, which very often had a panic taste. But no more late night beer drinking, nor spontaneous adventures nor meaningless chit-chats.My friends Julia and Mikhail

By that time, I worked as a photographer in different mass media and was trying to develop my own projects — I also got used to the idea that you can trust your camera with all of your problems. This is how ""Waiting"" started — from ""the end of era"", from the moment when everybody around me suddenly became adults, while staying vulnerable, hesitating and unguarded as they were before.

Chapter Two, which shows how to sleep with a stranger looking at you



After making several photographs of my friends I switched to their friends, and when there were no more pregnant people around - I started to look for expecting families in different social networks. I would say it was the most difficult part. I sent hundreds and hundreds of letters asking: ""can I photograph you sleeping?"" and in 99%  the reply was: ""you're insane!"". Very often people thought I'm going to steal something, or I want to show ""Russian people from a bad perspective"" (this is still a big mystery to me) or they were sure I'm going to damage their ceiling by installing a camera to it. But almost from the very beginning I had a goal to photograph 40 couples resembling 40 weeks in pregnancy and will not stop unless I make it. I was lucky to find really open minded people who would agree not only to let a stranger into a house, but also to stay asleep while this stranger is climbing the ladder, making noise, holding a camera right over their heads and — waiting.

Chapter Three where Masha forgot

In spite of the fact that everything looks so easy: find a family, come to their house either at night or early in the morning, climb the ladder and shoot — the whole process includes a lot of danger. 
Danger one: heaviness. Monopod, camera, remote control device — all together they weigh several kilograms.

Chapter Four where you’re looking for greater meaning
And the main question — what is it all about? While looking at photographs that appeared as an attempt to get used to the new stage of my life, by showing them to friends and colleagues, I realized that I was looking not only at different poses people sleep in, but mostly at things that surround them: all these slippers, sofas, mobile phones, toys on pillows, laptops, ""Star Wars"" bedsheets — all this is telling an amazing story about the generation to which I also belong — about people who were born just before the fall of the Soviet Union, about young families in big Russian cities, about ""here and now"".

And that the collaboration between funders and recipients, speakers and listeners will enliven our visual culture.Website: http://dhakaphotostories.wordpress.com/about/               http://carlottacentre.blogspot.com//",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

what we do: PHOTOGRAPHY
WORKSHOPS AND ART SHOWS FOR / BYFORMERLY TRAFFICKED WOMEN IN ITALY



lead by two italian photographers, Ippolita Franciosi e Letizia Rossi who believe that giving creative skills in digital photography to women is a way to share tools for empowerment and freedom. 


In Winter 2014- 15 two workshops were held Northern Italy,   very successful.

At
the end of each workshop, the Association  organized with the
cultural commission of the city of Ferrara,  a photo show titled
PATCHWORKS-
THE FACE OF FREEDOM IS FEMALE, which opened in Ferrara on March 8th
,with
the female artists presenting their view of the city to the Italian
public and a fundraising auction to fund the next workshop 
The city of Trieste hosted the second show  in May 2015

PROJECT background:



Instead
of doing another journalistic “expose’” on trafficked women in Italy, the two photographers gave cameras to the freed women.
Instead
of seeing the trafficking victims as ‘objects’ of our visual
attention, the workshop  engages  the immigrants women living in  
protected homes in Milan, Modena, Florence, Turin, creating a space
for their view of the world to emerge. During the workshop the women
document their point of view of the cities where they are now
patching a life together after years of enslavement.
 Their
 subjectivity emerges strongly in the choice  not to offer their
faces to be consumed in a photo, but rather to choose to photograph
details of life, friends and to take shots of their ‘new’ daily
life in the protected houses.

What We Need & What You Get




Each
workshop cotsts  $1200  approx 1000 euros
We need support to cover travel, installation costs to make the workshops and exhibits visible across the country, and internationally.  
keep in mind that only 30%  goes to  cover organizational costs, most funding raised for the trafficking victims and purchasing cameras  and organizing the exhibit
 each workshop is three days long
produces  30  to 45 prints  40cmx50cm on forex 
some prints are property of the participants and can not be sold


The Impact

We  gave trafficked women technical skills in digital photography, thus opening opportunities to work
We raised awareness among Italians that trafficking happens in their own town and such violence is too often invisible
We used photography to heal through the women's creativity, expressing their point of view instead of being seen as passive victims.

  Risks & Challenges Coprire almeno le spese di stampa della mostra per noi sarebbe già un buon obiettivo, per il resto crediamo nel lavoro di volontariato di una bella rete di persone che già credono in questo progetto.

I need your help to publish ""Florida Colors and Poetry”. This book is going to make a significant contribution to one of the most provocative issues today, preservation and restoration of nature and wildlife. Florida is a State of intense colors and natural beauty. Our mission is to help conserve and protect ecosystems and biodiversity. This means not only protecting wildlife, but also the land and water sources they use in order to thrive. 

                


My poems aim to create visual imagery in the mind of the reader and combine his imagination with actual pictures. To be able to express the emotions of the words from the poems and create a moving and provoking collaboration with the photographs we need your participation and support.  


This is how you can help
The budget has to cover some of the travel expenses, as well as the production and publishing of a high quality photography book. 


I am raising $5,000 that will cover the cost of publishing of 500 books. 70%
The books are going to have a hard cover with over 250 pages Over and 250 beautiful pictures that will let us see the miracles in the life around us.                                               



I have many
pictures, but I still have to complete the project and the budget has to cover
some travel expenses, 10%

I will use a professional editor and proofreader, for this project. 10%.
5% of my budget has to cover the beautiful perks, fees and bank charges. 
Distribution and marketing of the book will be 5% of the budget. 


     


  The Impact to Florida's natural beauty


Florida is Colorful and beautiful. One of the most rewarding gifts that we can enjoy is to see the power of colors in nature. 

This photography book allows you to explore amazing photos of birds going about their day and the natural beauty of flowers, sunsets and the Florida skies.          

The combine results of poetry with photography raises its own particular questions about the rich possibilities for incorporating linked languages and artistic expressions.
This book is going to display a different perspective of the preservation of the environment, with poetry and a touch of history.  
We are going to make a donation of the book sales to a Florida conservation or wildlife preservation organization to ensure that nature will be around for future generations to enjoy.
 

        
           


This project started in my heart   
Be a part of the movement to make Florida a better place. I have been a Florida resident for over 30 years, taking pictures and participating in numerous exhibitions and community base artistic organizations. When I travel around Florida, I have to take pictures of flowers, sunsets, birds and wildlife, wondering sometimes if my great grandsons will be able to see what my eyes are seeing.    I love taking pictures and writing, it is my passion and I have fun with it.
When I shoot I have to be aware of everything if I want to capture it. You can't be thinking to much, but feeling and blend with the surroundings.
 But I need your help, I can't make this project without you.

<p>As an artist and young mother of two, my funds are very modest at 
best. I have always learned to adjust and achieve the best quality with 
what I am given to bring the ideas in my head to life. I am at the point
 in my life, where I want to create a finished piece of an idea that I 
have dreamt about since I was a young girl. </p>
<p>I have always been an
 ""Urban Explorer,"" starting very young in high school exploring the 
local abandoned buildings, tunnels, and houses that were easily 
accessible. To me these locations were beautiful despite others 
considering them eyesores. These locations were our past; our history. I
 wanted to capture it all eternally. So as that when they were gone, and
 the world had moved on, others to come after us would know what once 
existed in magnificence even after it was abandoned and left to decay. I
 want to show how there is still youth appreciation for what our 
forefathers had created before us; wonders that seem impossible even 
compared to our standards today. Visualize the beauty that is still left
 in the decay that was left to this generation and those that will 
follow us before it is demolished from existence. Each of these 
locations has a vivid history still left in it's remains with new 
memories to create. To bring this visualization to life, I want to take 
various models and talented artists and place/ photograph them in these 
locations to allow others to see the beauty and ideas that exist through
 our stylization of the space. I want to show the beauty of the decay 
such as we see beauty in the age of even ourselves. I want to evoke all 
feelings whether it be happiness, admiration, love, hope, or on the 
opposite spectrum; fear, anger, or despair. </p>
<p>The funds I am 
seeking are to purchase a much more capable camera and lens, the cost of
 shooting (permits, equipment, travel, etc) as I will not be charging 
the subjects in these photos, and the cost of producing  the completed 
book. <br/></p>
<p>Even if I do not raise all the specified funds I will still be pooling the money to purchasing a new camera or finding a gently used one and continuing pursuing my passion. I will still push towards the goal of completing the book of photographic imagery based on Urban Exploring by 2015. </p>
<p>I want this project to become part of the legacy I leave to my children. I am a young woman that has been faced with many trials from a young age. I have undergone many surgeries and I am currently missing 6 organs in my body. I have life long incurable medical conditions that affect me daily and yet I still push myself to do more and to make the most out of the time I am given here on earth. I could have given up but instead I find my hope and my light through two beautiful little girls and the art that I am able to create. I am thankful to the higher beings who have blessed me with the gift of optimism and determination. I am asking for the support of others to make my dream a reality by helping me fund my goal to further my photography and aspirations to be the best that I can be. </p>
<p>Even if you may not be able to contribute financially, I will take any assistance i can get! From information on locations that fit the criteria, to models and talented artists, to passing on this page to others who may be able to contribute or possibly even donate some of the required materiel.  Anything and everything is much appreciated!!! <br/></p>

<h3>About the Bonfire of the Inanities Project and its Creator</h3>
<p>I am Michael Bugard, a Detroit based actor and artist.  I have worked on many independent horror features including <em>13th Sign</em> starring Waylon Reavis and Jeff Hatrix of Mushroomhead, and can be seen as an elilte Hunt Club client in <em>Hostel: Part III</em>.  I have also written an article about horror film production in Michigan, published in issue X of Michigan Movie Magagzine.</p>
<p>I am a lifelong fan of cinema (especially horror) and comic books.  I am bringing these passions together in an upcoming photo shoot that will be controversial, bizarre, and completely original, inspired by the above quote from Robin Wood's essay, ""An Introduction to the American Horror Film"".</p>
<p>I will be bringing together much local talent, including the photographer Sean Graham, known for his work with Noir Leather,  and Donna Terwilliger and Melody Montiel of Melodonna Beayty/FX.  Most exciting of all, this will feature <strong>Tom Sullivan</strong>, creator of the iconic <strong>Book of the Dead</strong> for the <strong>Evil Dead</strong> movie franchise, as a model!</p>
<p>This is significant because it brings together two generations of Michigan horror artists.  It is an opportunity for horror fans to pay homage and support a person who contributed significantly to one of the most popular horror franchises in history.  We need your help to do this right.  It will mean the difference between bringing shame or glory to our horror freak community. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need about $800 to do this right.  We need nun outfits, a priest costume, and a monk outift.  We need religious props.  Most of all, we need food and gas, which acounts for over half the budget!  This shoot will be located at two points about halfway across the state from each other.  We will also have to feed about 15-18 people each day.</p>
<p>Depending on how much you give, you will receive a thank you in our production credits all the way to producer credit, several autographed prints and free online access to the entire shoot!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal we will still have the shoot, but unfortunately we will have to forage for food and siphon gas out of some unsuspecting farmer's tractor.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We hope to create something truly unique.  We are creating a photographic story, very similar to a comic or graphic novel, that will be available online with a musical soundtrack.  We may also have a print version available.  With the diverse group of talent I have assembled for this project I am confident that, with your help, we can help put Detroit and Michigan back on the cultural map.</p>

<div><strong>THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!</strong></div></div>","The release of sexuality in the horror film is always presented as perverted, monstrous, and excessive (whether it take the form of vampires, giant ants, or Mrs. Bates), both the perversion and the excess being the logical outcome of repression. -- Robin Wood
About the Bonfire of the Inanities Project and its Creator
I am Michael Bugard, a Detroit based actor and artist.  I have worked on many independent horror features including 13th Sign starring Waylon Reavis and Jeff Hatrix of Mushroomhead, and can be seen as an elilte Hunt Club client in Hostel: Part III.  I have also written an article about horror film production in Michigan, published in issue X of Michigan Movie Magagzine.
I am a lifelong fan of cinema (especially horror) and comic books.  I am bringing these passions together in an upcoming photo shoot that will be controversial, bizarre, and completely original, inspired by the above quote from Robin Wood's essay, ""An Introduction to the American Horror Film"".
I will be bringing together much local talent, including the photographer Sean Graham, known for his work with Noir Leather,  and Donna Terwilliger and Melody Montiel of Melodonna Beayty/FX.  Most exciting of all, this will feature Tom Sullivan, creator of the iconic Book of the Dead for the Evil Dead movie franchise, as a model!
This is significant because it brings together two generations of Michigan horror artists.  It is an opportunity for horror fans to pay homage and support a person who contributed significantly to one of the most popular horror franchises in history.  We need your help to do this right.  It will mean the difference between bringing shame or glory to our horror freak community. 


What We Need & What You Get
We need about $800 to do this right.  We need nun outfits, a priest costume, and a monk outift.  We need religious props.  Most of all, we need food and gas, which acounts for over half the budget!  This shoot will be located at two points about halfway across the state from each other.  We will also have to feed about 15-18 people each day.
Depending on how much you give, you will receive a thank you in our production credits all the way to producer credit, several autographed prints and free online access to the entire shoot!
If we do not reach our goal we will still have the shoot, but unfortunately we will have to forage for food and siphon gas out of some unsuspecting farmer's tractor.


The Impact
We hope to create something truly unique.  We are creating a photographic story, very similar to a comic or graphic novel, that will be available online with a musical soundtrack.  We may also have a print version available.  With the diverse group of talent I have assembled for this project I am confident that, with your help, we can help put Detroit and Michigan back on the cultural map.

<p>JNH and Beaux Mort desperately need your help. We're trying to raise $1,000 to split two ways, equally.</p>
<p>JNH's (Jess)  camera (nikon d2x) suffered a fall and will no longer turn on. This is pretty devastating as photography is her passion and without her camera she cannot pursue it. The camera will take $400 to fix, and one of the batteries also needs replaced so the extra $100 of her share will go towards a new battery.</p>
<p><a href=""http://facebook.com/jnhphoto"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://facebook.com/jnhphoto</a></p>
<p>Beax Mort (Kat) is an incredibly talented woman with a passion and love for photography who finds herself at a standstill working with substandard, home-made equipment and a starter camera. In order to break away from the daily grind and advance in her career she needs a boost, all of her half of the funding will be put with the selling of her old starter camera and used to purchase a camera that will help her advance and really begin creating!</p>

<div>Both of us are photographers for a group called Grotesque Burlesque. Based in Ohio, GB showcases sexy undead Zombabes and demons from hell called Legion.

<h2>ILNAMIQUI: Preserving our cultural memories</h2>
<p>Ilnamiqui, a word from the Nahuatl language of the Aztecs, means “to remember.” It also means, “reflect upon” or to “recall” things such as songs, ancestors, revenants.</p>
<p>In the Maldives, there is an indigenous calendar called <i>nakaiy, </i>which follows the changes in weather and the rising and the setting of the stars. For centuries it has determined the best time to fish, travel, plant crops, build a house, or even get married. However, because of climate change, this traditional method is no longer reliable for the Maldivians.</p>
<p>In Peru, the Huacapunco dance at the foot of their lagoon. Dressed in typical costumes to the beat of a pair of flutes and drums, they thank the Pachamama (goddess) and his apus that the water will not be foreign to them during the dry months. However, their prayers and offerings seem no longer enough as the lagoon where they get water from continues to dry up.</p>

<p><br/>In the Himalayan Region of Nepal, the Dhe Village has struggled with their agricultural practices like grazing. There is less snow today than in previous years, drying up other water sources as well as their grass fields. This translates to livestock such as goats and cattles dying. For centuries people of the region have been celebrating festivals called <i>loshar</i> and <i>yartung</i>. Each house contributes grains to make food and <i>chang</i> (local beer) for the whole village. Eating, drinking, singing and dancing used to be the part such festivals. As the food-production is decreases and livestock dwindles, villagers are finding hard to continue these traditions.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>These are only some stories where climate change is dramatically changing centuries old cultures and traditions. What happens when our indigenous knowledge and ways of life can no longer adapt to climate change? What happens when we need to leave the land and the seas we used to live in and navigate? Culture is ever changing, but the need to adapt to climate change is making these changes happen faster. Before everything completely changes and vanishes because of climate change, this book wants to keep our cultural memories alive.</p>

So, I started traveling to Europe and experience what the world has to offer while my photographic skills were growing day by day.</p><p><strong>In 2010, western culture was not enough anymore</strong> and just like in my childhood years I stormed out of the “door” of Europe and <strong>found my self in Uganda</strong>. <strong>No plan</strong>, no idea, <strong>no reservations</strong>.

So <strong>“In touch” was born.</strong></p><p>Since then <strong>I have traveled in over 40 countries around the world</strong>, with no plan, almost no money, but with a thirst <strong>to find my self and capture the world in a way that expresses how I feel and how I dream about reality</strong>. I wanted to meet people and see the world from a <strong>different perspective</strong> every single day.

</h4><h4><br/></h4><h4><b>The 100 Cameras Project</b></h4>With anticipation, I watched Nicole lift her left elbow up and push down on the large blue button that was attached to her wheelchair with a strap of Velcro.  The sound of the camera shutter went off and an image instantly appeared in the viewfinder.  Nicole shook with excitement and yelled out to the room full of on-lookers, “My very first picture!” <br/><br/>Nicole (second from left, front row) is one of the 10 photographers who participated in the very first photography workshops for the 100 Cameras Project, held in Springfield, MA.  And Nicole, along with many of the other project participants, had the opportunity to take pictures for the first time that day.  She had never been able to physically do so prior to the 100 Cameras Project. <br/> <br/><p>My name is Courtney Bent and it's been my dream, since the premiere of my award-winning documentary film, <a href=""http://www.shootingbeauty.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shooting Beauty</a>, which chronicles a photography program I developed at United Cerebral Palsy in Boston, MA, to create a national initiative to help people with intellectual and developmental disabilities express themselves through photography.  Hence, the 100 Cameras Project!  The 100 Cameras Project will put modified camera systems into the hands of 100 people with disabilities ranging from autism to down syndrome to Alzheimer's to cerebral Palsy, throughout the U.S., bringing the vision of these new photographers to life while building awareness of disability, diversity and inclusion through art.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/598416/files/20140522191401-groupBaystate.jpg?1400811241"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p>I will travel throughout the United States and conduct photography workshops  and provide these new photographers with a life changing opportunity to explore an art-form that for many, up until this project, has not been physically or monetarily accessible.  With cameras in hand, the project photographers are given the chance to overcome invisibility and tell the stories of their lives- their struggles, their accomplishments, their loves, losses and simply what they think is beautiful- through their eyes alone.  No one else’s.<br/></p><br/>The National photography exhibitions and public events resulting from the 100 Cameras Project will help to amplify these new photographers’ voices, ultimately enabling the broader community to identify with these individuals in a way never before.  If successful, the project will not only empower and build confidence in the new photographers, but will stand as an example of the potential of art to heal, to inspire, and to prove to all of us that no matter what our ability levels or differences are, we have more in common than what meets the eye.<br/> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/421563/files/20140309072520-Kickpics4c.jpg?1394375120"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/526344/files/20140422155430-100CamerasLOGOpg2.jpg?1398207270"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>How it will work: <br/>
</h3>Since the film’s premiere, the Shooting Beauty team 
has seen an overwhelming interest in continuing the photography workshop
 featured in the film. Unfortunately, there are very limited resources 
for access to the arts for individuals with disabilities. Seeing the 
empowering effect of photography on the group I worked with in Shooting 
Beauty, let alone the effect that their work had on the broader 
community, I felt the need to create the 100 Cameras Project. <br/><br/>With this 
project, I will replicate the photography workshop featured in the film and work with partner organizations throughout the U.S. to identify photographers for the project.  I will then conduct physical assessments of each photographer to determine what adaptive equipment will be needed to to create a camera system that can accommodate each photographers unique abilities.  
I will then travel to the new photographersʼ communities and provide a 2-3 day photography workshop
 that will culminate in an exhibition of photographs and a series of 
public events conducted in schools, universities, businesses and art 
venues aimed at breaking down barriers of communication and encouraging a
 community-wide conversation around disability, tolerance, diversity and
 the possibilities of what we can all do when given a camera, a voice

The 100 Cameras ProjectWith anticipation, I watched Nicole lift her left elbow up and push down on the large blue button that was attached to her wheelchair with a strap of Velcro.  The sound of the camera shutter went off and an image instantly appeared in the viewfinder.  Nicole shook with excitement and yelled out to the room full of on-lookers, “My very first picture!” Nicole (second from left, front row) is one of the 10 photographers who participated in the very first photography workshops for the 100 Cameras Project, held in Springfield, MA.  And Nicole, along with many of the other project participants, had the opportunity to take pictures for the first time that day.  She had never been able to physically do so prior to the 100 Cameras Project.  My name is Courtney Bent and it's been my dream, since the premiere of my award-winning documentary film, Shooting Beauty, which chronicles a photography program I developed at United Cerebral Palsy in Boston, MA, to create a national initiative to help people with intellectual and developmental disabilities express themselves through photography.  Hence, the 100 Cameras Project!  The 100 Cameras Project will put modified camera systems into the hands of 100 people with disabilities ranging from autism to down syndrome to Alzheimer's to cerebral Palsy, throughout the U.S., bringing the vision of these new photographers to life while building awareness of disability, diversity and inclusion through art.I will travel throughout the United States and conduct photography workshops  and provide these new photographers with a life changing opportunity to explore an art-form that for many, up until this project, has not been physically or monetarily accessible.  With cameras in hand, the project photographers are given the chance to overcome invisibility and tell the stories of their lives- their struggles, their accomplishments, their loves, losses and simply what they think is beautiful- through their eyes alone.  No one else’s.The National photography exhibitions and public events resulting from the 100 Cameras Project will help to amplify these new photographers’ voices, ultimately enabling the broader community to identify with these individuals in a way never before.  If successful, the project will not only empower and build confidence in the new photographers, but will stand as an example of the potential of art to heal, to inspire, and to prove to all of us that no matter what our ability levels or differences are, we have more in common than what meets the eye. How it will work: 
Since the film’s premiere, the Shooting Beauty team 
has seen an overwhelming interest in continuing the photography workshop
 featured in the film. Unfortunately, there are very limited resources 
for access to the arts for individuals with disabilities. Seeing the 
empowering effect of photography on the group I worked with in Shooting 
Beauty, let alone the effect that their work had on the broader 
community, I felt the need to create the 100 Cameras Project. With this 
project, I will replicate the photography workshop featured in the film and work with partner organizations throughout the U.S. to identify photographers for the project.  I will then conduct physical assessments of each photographer to determine what adaptive equipment will be needed to to create a camera system that can accommodate each photographers unique abilities.  
I will then travel to the new photographersʼ communities and provide a 2-3 day photography workshop
 that will culminate in an exhibition of photographs and a series of 
public events conducted in schools, universities, businesses and art 
venues aimed at breaking down barriers of communication and encouraging a
 community-wide conversation around disability, tolerance, diversity and
 the possibilities of what we can all do when given a camera, a voice 
and a chance. How You Can HelpAND.....we need your help to make this all possible!   The cost for each photographer to participate in the workshop and receive a customized camera system is $850.  In order to successfully launch this project, the Shooting Beauty team needs to raise $85,000.  $20,000 has already been raised and we hope to raise the additional funds through Indiegogo!The project funds will go towards the cost of all workshop expenses including cameras for each participant, adaptive equipment to allow cameras to be accessible to individuals with even the most significant disabilities,  workshop supplies, photographs for exhibitions, national travel expenses for Courtney Bent and production time for the Shooting Beauty team.  We hope you’ll consider being a part of the project!Workshop Partners: We are excited to announce that Velcro USA, Inc. is an official product and financial sponsor of the 100 Cameras Project!

Ihr kennt mich vielleicht aus der deutschen Internet-und-Fotoszene, wo ich seit 2010 als Blogger und Fotograf aktiv bin. Vielleicht habt ihr schon einmal was von mir gelesen oder gesehen – vielleicht aber auch nicht. In den letzten 8 Jahren habe ich unzählige Fotografen kennenlernen dürfen, viele Fotografen auf meinem Blog mit ihrer Arbeit vorgestellt und selber den Weg in die Fotografie gefunden. 2016 habe ich mit Eurer Hilfe meinen ersten eigenen Bildband mit dem Titel ""DAS LEBEN UND STERBEN DES BENHAMMER"" hier auf Indiegogo realisiert. Ein analoger Bildband über meine Leidenschaft zur Fotografie  und meine ganz persönliche Sicht auf meine Mitmenschen. Jetzt möchte ich den damals bereits angekündigten Nachfolger mit Eurer Hilfe ebenfalls wahr werden lassen.</p><h3>Und genau dafür brauche ich jetzt Eure Hilfe!</h3><p>Hier findet ihr ein paar Interviews aus den letzten Jahren, die vielleicht noch ein bisschen mehr über mich und meine Arbeit erzählen.

</ul><h3>Wie ihr mir helfen könnt?</h3><p>Ganz einfach. Ich brauche Euer Geld, damit ich dieses Buch produzieren kann. SO, wie ich es mir vorstelle und ohne Kompromisse. Dafür brauche ich nach Absprache mit Layouter und Druckerei ca. 8700 Euro. Außerdem nehmen sich Steuern, Indiegogo und Banken natürlich noch ein bisschen vom Kuchen. Je mehr Geld wir hier zusammensammeln, desto schöner und exklusiver werden wir dieses kleine Herzensprojekt gestalten und es zu etwas besonderem für jeden von Euch machen.</p><p>Und deswegen brauche ich Euer Geld. Aber ich will es nicht geschenkt haben! Nein, ich will, dass ihr für Euren Support einen Gegenwert erhaltet. Und ihr in meine Welt der Fotografie eintaucht, um danach Eure eigene Arbeit vielleicht aus einer ganz neuen Perspektive zusehen. Darum habe ich mir wieder ein paar PERKs ausgedacht, die hoffentlich für jeden von Euch irgendeinen kleinen oder großen Mehrwert. <u><strong>Ganz wichtig:</strong></u> <u>Sollte dieses Funding aus irgendeinem Grund nicht funktionieren – was ich natürlich nicht hoffe, weil ich irgendwie auf Euch setze – bekommt ihr alle die Kohle von Indiegogo wieder!</u></p><h3>Und was ist ""DAS LEBEN UND STERBEN DES BENHAMMER - Teil 2"" jetzt?</h3><p>Am 13. April 2017 ist ""DAS LEBEN UND STERBEN DES BENHAMMER"" erschienen. Ziemlich genau vor einem Jahr. Ein komplett analoger Bildband mit Bildern aus einer Olympus Mju 2, die ich 2016 jeden Tag dabei hatte. Er zeigt einen ungeschönten und intensiven Blick auf mein ganz persönliches 2016. </p><p>Nachdem Crowdfunding zog ich mich eine lange Zeit zurück. Arbeite mit der Designerin 4 Monate am Layout, presste die Flut an Bildern in eine Geschichte und zog mich aus dem ganzen Party- und Projektleben etwas zurück. Ich verbrachte 2017 oft in Gedanken versunken und ließ nebenher die Ideen für den Nachfolger Teil entstehen.</p><p>Da sich auch meine freien Strecken zunehmend in Schwarz-Weiß Portraits verschoben haben, entschied ich Ende letzten Jahres den Nachfolger auch in analogem Schwarzweiß zu fotografieren. Wie bei ""DAS LEBEN UND STERBEN DES BENHAMMER"" wollte ich mich wieder auf eine Kamera festlegen und kaufte mir Ende des Jahres eine Contax G2. <a href=""http://www.benventures.de/mein-neues-spielzeug-contax-g2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dazu schrieb ich etwas ausführlicher im Blog</a>.

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>After growing up in the countryside I have a passion for the outdoors. I am in my final year of my photography degree. My project will be exhibited in both Surrey and London.</p>
<p>The project explores a persons connection to the land. A landscape is often a place of escapism from everyday life. I have photographed my sitters in their the comfort of their own home then I ask them to choose an outdoor location that is personal to them in some way. This photographs are then merged together to create a space individual to each sitter.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding reasied will be put towards the presentation of my work. I am shooting medium format film on my beautiful Hassleblad camera. Please note that the photo preview is a digital test as it is a long process shooting on film. I aim to present the work on acrylic and light them with back lit led display panels. This will ight up the photographs as if lit by daylight beautifully to bring out the layers and locations with in the photograph. </p>
<p>Even if I do not reach the entire goal I will be grateful for everything I recieve as it will still go towards my exhibitions. </p>

opening up this opportunity to young offenders, 
young people that have been excluded from schools or are at risk of exclusion  and young people in the wider community from
disadvantaged backgrounds, but it will not be completely exclusive. Most of these
groups will be sourced from specific youth projects, alternative schools,
PRU’s, Mainstream schools and youth clubs, using the strong connections and
experience our staff have in this sector. These programs will aim to encourage
creativity and provide engaging avenues for learning through experience and
inspiration.

-Kigali Guard, KigaliThe Impact Of your Support goes beyond the Exhibition

This exhibition Promotes, increased tourism and
investment into Rwanda through the positive images presented.
It reaches out through a cutting edge cultural
event and educational program to a younger more diverse demographic who would
not otherwise necessarily access information about Rwanda or Photography.
The showing of these
images open up a new dialogue related to Rwanda and allows for positive interventions
highlighting Rwanda's achievements on the occasion of this Anniversary.
Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help the campaign and let people know how the their contribution will make a differenceAsk folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!
Thank you so much for your support, we hope to see you all
at the Exhibition and if you can’t make it we hope you enjoy the perks for
giving. Salon Africa and Harrison Thane look forward to making this exhibition
a reality and to share these beautiful images with the world during a time of commemoration.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm currently raising funds to replace my camera that recently broke. It was getting old and used so much -- it actually stopped functioning *while* I was on a shoot. Most embarrassing moment as a photographer ever. Luckily, my client had a backup camera that I was able to use to finish the job. Alas, that backup camera isn't always there for all the work I have to do/finish.</p>
<p>I'm an internationally exhibited photographer, my work's been featured in Vice, Out Magazine, Urb, etc, and I'm currently producing two human rights documentaries.</p>
<p>Having a camera is essential to my livelihood. Without one, I can't finish my films or even commission work to pay my bills/survive. Due to recent financial hardships, I'm not able to afford a replacement. I've started this campaign in hopes that I can raise enough money to replace my camera and continue working.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of my work, please consider donating towards my fund -- any amount helps!</p>If you'd like to learn more about me, here are some links to my work.

<h4>About the Photographer<br/>
</h4>
<p>Hi, I'm Courtney Slade, a photographer living in Austin, Texas. My
 entire life I have surrounded myself with water. Growing up in the Texas Hill Country I always found one lake beginning to cross my path as another had just ended. Moving an hour east to study photojournalism at The University of Texas at Austin, I 
was still captured by water’s presence. Lake Austin became my escape. </p>
<p>After graduating from UT I started my photography business centered around travel and water sports. Shortly after, I launched a website called <a href=""http://sladeswake.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Slades Wake</a>, a one-stop-shop lake resource for Lake Austin, Lake Travis and Lady Bird Lake.</p>
<h4>The Campaign<br/>
</h4>
<p>This fall I will be leaving for a photographic road trip. Combining my love for documenting water and those who build and enjoy their lives around it, I'll hit the road. Loading up my Land Cruiser and preparing it to be my home, I'll begin my travels and documentation of different bodies of water throughout the western part of the United States. <br/></p>
<p>I'll be traveling to various lakes, both those well known and others not so known. Camping at state and national parks, my purpose will be to document and share all that I come across while on the trip. Taking boards along with me I'll SUP, surf and explore life along the water's edge. My travel route will consist of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado. The end result will be a self-published photography book filled with images and text from what I see to who I meet along the way.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>It's Importance and Impact<br/>
</h4>
<p>Do you ever feel like you just need to go? There is a pull. Your heart is on one end while the unknown is on the other. It's the people you've never met, the places you've never been, an experience you'll have forever. <br/></p>
<p>Life is an adventure. It's leaving all comfort and routine in the rear view mirror. It's finding your passion and running straight towards it, not looking back.</p>
<p>Just like every other person, I've searched for a purpose. Something that puts a smile on my face every day, something that makes me want to be a better person, something I can give back to this world.<br/></p>
<p>I believe photography is my key to the answer. It's what makes me tick. It's what makes me feel alive.</p>
<p>To me, life is about the moments, the experience. <br/></p>
<p>With your help and belief I'll be able to turn this dream, this passion into a reality to share with the rest of the world. Your contribution will bring more knowledge of the natural beauty we are surrounded by each day to others.<br/></p>

About the Photographer

Hi, I'm Courtney Slade, a photographer living in Austin, Texas. My
 entire life I have surrounded myself with water. Growing up in the Texas Hill Country I always found one lake beginning to cross my path as another had just ended. Moving an hour east to study photojournalism at The University of Texas at Austin, I 
was still captured by water’s presence. Lake Austin became my escape. 
After graduating from UT I started my photography business centered around travel and water sports. Shortly after, I launched a website called Slades Wake, a one-stop-shop lake resource for Lake Austin, Lake Travis and Lady Bird Lake.
The Campaign

This fall I will be leaving for a photographic road trip. Combining my love for documenting water and those who build and enjoy their lives around it, I'll hit the road. Loading up my Land Cruiser and preparing it to be my home, I'll begin my travels and documentation of different bodies of water throughout the western part of the United States. 
I'll be traveling to various lakes, both those well known and others not so known. Camping at state and national parks, my purpose will be to document and share all that I come across while on the trip. Taking boards along with me I'll SUP, surf and explore life along the water's edge. My travel route will consist of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado. The end result will be a self-published photography book filled with images and text from what I see to who I meet along the way.

It's Importance and Impact

Do you ever feel like you just need to go? There is a pull. Your heart is on one end while the unknown is on the other. It's the people you've never met, the places you've never been, an experience you'll have forever. 
Life is an adventure. It's leaving all comfort and routine in the rear view mirror. It's finding your passion and running straight towards it, not looking back.
Just like every other person, I've searched for a purpose. Something that puts a smile on my face every day, something that makes me want to be a better person, something I can give back to this world.
I believe photography is my key to the answer. It's what makes me tick. It's what makes me feel alive.
To me, life is about the moments, the experience. 
With your help and belief I'll be able to turn this dream, this passion into a reality to share with the rest of the world. Your contribution will bring more knowledge of the natural beauty we are surrounded by each day to others.

This publication is a photographic nature book of unparalleled quality, featuring shots of bizarre, rare and endangered reptiles and amphibians. Through Matthijs’ enigmatic photographs, you will witness the savage and breathtaking beauty of these animals.   This book is an incomparable collection of some of the most peculiar species that have ever crawled or slithered on the Earth; some of which are carefully dwelling in the most hidden crevices of the Planet! From top to bottom: Giant monkey frog, Two-headed corn snake, Green Keel-bellied lizard, Plumed basilisk, Smooth helmeted iguana
   Fierce but fragile, this book allows you to see these animals in their true form: explore the shocking diversity of the herpetofauna through more than 70 captivating portraits of cold blooded species.   The COLD INSTINCT book has two foldout spreads: one featuring photographs of lizards and another one featuring four cobra portraits
  THE GOAL Our vision: we want to publish an art book on nature of the highest quality, a collectable coffee table book with dramatic and captivating photography. Support us so you can release the sought after book by Matthijs. All Indiegogo pledges are introduction prices to The Cold Instinct Series, so you can be sure that you will get an exceptional deal in the funding phase.  Matthijs is an award-winning photographer who has been published worldwide on National Geographic, BBC wildlife magazine, Netflix, The Guardian, Time Magazine and Discovery Channel - just to name a few. 
 Fuelled by his childhood passion, Matthijs left school to go to Madagascar and work with reptiles and amphibians; 27 years on Matthijs has become an expert photographer in his field. He is relentless, never failing to pick up his camera despite the number of dangerous encounters he has incurred.    Armoured giants, venomous toads and other crawling creatures: Matthijs owns a vast collection of reptile and amphibian photographs; and by vast... we mean really immense: he has photographed an impressive 1500 species and counting. He’s one of the few people owning such a powerful compilation of coldblooded fauna.   Incredibly diverse and rarely seen: In COLD INSTINCT, Matthijs has selected his greatest shots and the most extraordinary species he came across, to showcase a comprehensive selection of his body of work. His aim is to capture the pure essence of the animals, and he does that by completely removing the environment and habitat.  During this photographic project, Matthijs has a mission: he wants to counteract the common stereotypes associated with these colourful animals. He would like us to abandon the fear and negative thoughts that often surround them. What’s left is the bizarre beauty of the reptiles and amphibians, in their simplest form, no backgrounds and no distractions. 
  Matthijs creates a close relationship with his subjects when photographing  - but you will be astonished rather than fearful, and you might just find yourself feeling intrigued. Matthijs is the Dutch Crocodile Dundee. He is one of the most passionate herpers out there. He has traveled the world through mountains and deserts to capture the rarest and most endangered cold blooded specimens, from the rain forests of Cameroon to the Dragon island of Komodo. He’s been on the trail of the most venomous and poisonous reptiles on the planet. A true master of camouflage: mossy frog (Theloderma corticale) This snake charmer’s lifestyle needs special equipment, so Kuijpers has two portable studios for different situations. One is for extreme locations without electricity and one is for travelling light. The other studio is a little bigger, (still portable), equipped with studio lights and used for conservation parks.Matthijs and his wife and two daughters also care for a number of diverse animals at home and they share his passion by fully supporting him on his endeavors. From top to bottom: Collet snake, Mount Hanang chameleon, Malayan horned frog 
Did you know that about 86% of species on Earth are still waiting to be found? Most of those creatures could become extinct before we get a chance to discover them. Every year, approximately 18,000 new species are discovered and classified. We believe that about 20,000 species go extinct annually.   
The geographic range of the coldblooded animals featured in the bookAmphibians might look scary at first, but they are much more vulnerable than they appear. Their survival is challenged daily by threats of climate change, pollution and poaching. Habitat loss is the greatest threat to cold species in Europe. Some reptiles and amphibians have cleverly adapted to the threatening conditions, but they are in constant need of protection. Our hope is to create awareness of just how much these little guys need our attention. We need to know how we can help protect them; but for that, we must learn more about them. The Eastern collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris collaris).They are able to run on their hind legs and reach 25 km/h!

 For centuries Italian bookbinders have been world famous for being the best in their field. From monastic scriptures to encyclopedia they produced masterpieces through attention to quality and details.Despite heritage, one of the many reasons we chose an Italian supplier, rather than a cheaper one abroad, was the ability to verify the quality of the product itself.We have a  lot of trust in our producer, Kappadue. They followed us all the way through our first book campaign, CHICken!. Thanks to their great support and collaboration during the book's design process, we have made a book that we are truly proud of and that inspired us to experiment with book publishing again. We chose certified paper, produced exclusively with cellulose fibers from sustainably managed forests. Our suppliers guarantee the usage of 100% FSC® wood. All our rewards are printed, bound and packaged in Italy, for an optimum quality of the final product. We don't compromise.

<h3>What is the Alpine Exposures Photo Book?</h3>
<div>The Alpine Exposures Photo book is a coffee table book that will showcase Jon Griffith's work over the last ten years in the mountain sports industry. True to Jon's work ethic the book only shows photos taken in real situations in order to offer readers an in-depth experience of the world of extreme mountain sports. Featuring shots from around the European Alps from the Eiger North Face to Mont Blanc, there are detailed captions accompanying every shot- there is a real focus here on inspirational photography not just eye candy.</div>
<div>Scattered throughout the book are longer photo essays that showcase certain big or classic climbs and that we feel deserve more than just one photo to describe the climb. In a way the book is a photographic guide to what we feel are the Alps's most beautiful climbs, ski descents, and flying terrains, and will hopefully inspire the reader to add a few more climbs/descents to their tick list.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Excerpt from the Foreword by Ueli Steck: </b></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p><i>The one thing that will always be hard for
me to accept is when we pack our bags and Jon puts in his heavy camera – I’m
quite a stickler when it comes to keeping weight to a minimum, and my consolation
for that now is in this book. Life in the present moment is what counts.
Experiences and encounters are what we keep and what shapes us. Jon’s
photography conveys these experiences. He captures the authenticity and spirit
of these moments in time and I’m glad that he at least is keeping a record of
them.</i></p>

<div><h4>About</h4></div>
<div>Hinter dem ganzen Buch - angefangen von der Grundidee über die Fotografien, Texte, Layout und Grafik bis zu der Vermarktung - stehe ich, Eva Frischling, selbstständige Fotografin und Islandnarr aus Salzburg / Österreich.</div>
<div>Angefangen hat alles mit einem harmlosen Islandaufenthalt, der dann so viel mehr war als ich mir vorstellte. Also konnte ich nicht anders als die wunderbaren Momente festhalten und die Geschichten dazu in der ganzen Welt verteilen.</div>
<div>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Erstauflage</h4>
</div>
<div>Das Buch wird mit einer Erstauflage von 500 Stück auf Deutsch erscheinen - hochwertig hergestellt wie ein Bildband auch sein soll. So etwas kostet aber auch, und deshalb bin ich auf euch angewiesen.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Kosten</h3> <p>Ihr alle könnt mir helfen, einen Teil der Druckkosten abzudecken und so meinenTraum von Island zu verwirklichen.</p>
<p>Die Druckkosten für die erste Auflage beziehen sich auf ca. 7.000 Euro, also rund 9.400 USD.</p>
<p>Wird das finanzielle Ziel bei Indiegogo erreicht, dann sind ca. 4.000 Euro, also 5.400 USD, in der Tasche, und der Druck kann sofort beginnen.</p>
<p>Wird das Funding-Ziel von den 5.400 USD nicht erreicht, dann wird das Projekt trotzdem umgesetzt. Es ist zwar schwieriger, aber nicht unmöglich. Die Finanzmittel die bis dahin eingelangt sind, gehen selbstverständlich direkt in die Druckkosten-Sparkasse über.<br/></p> <div>Als Gegenzug für euer Geld bekommt ihr sogenannte ""Perks"". Die Perks für ""Lebensgefühl Island"" gehen von Postkarten und Kunstdrucke über ein auf Glas geprintetes  Panoramabild bis hin zu den Bildbänden.</div>

<br/><p></p>
<ul><li>Der erste Text nennt sich Hreindýr - also Rentiere:<br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>""</b> Wie bekannt, gibt es in Island 13 Weihnachtsmänner. Ob es jetzt purer Zufall ist oder eine arrangierte Sache, dass im Jahre 1771 genau 13 Rentiere aus Skandinavien importiert wurden, wird wohl unbeantwortet bleiben.</p>
<p>Fakt ist jedoch, dass diese Rentiere nach Island geholt wurden, um vermehrt zu werden und als zusätzliche Nahrungsquelle zu dienen.</p>
<p>Erst nach 87 Jahren war die Population dieser Tiere so hoch, dass sie durch ein Jagdgesetz zum Abschuss freigegeben werden konnten.</p>
<p>Weil diese Tiere jedoch keinen großen Beitrag zur Nahrungsversorgung darstellten, eher schon eine Belastung waren, da sie immer in großen Herden ankamen und alles niedertrampelten, wurden alle Rentiere in den östlichen Teil der Insel verjagt. Dort sind heute noch ca. 3000 Exemplare zu Hause. Den Sommer verbringen sie in den Bergen und sind für kaum jemanden zu Gesicht zu bekommen. Im Winter jedoch, wenn das Futter auf der hohen Lage wenig wird, kommen sie ins Tal und treiben dort ihr Unwesen: sie springen über alle Zäune und reißen diese auch teilweise nieder, zertrampeln die Wiesen und Acker und fressen die übrig gebliebene Ernte bis zur Wurzel ab.</p>
<p>Nichts desto trotz ist es ein einmaliges Erlebnis auf der Ringstraße zu fahren und neben sich Hunderte von diesen stolzen, riesengroßen Tieren mit atemberaubenden Geweihen zu sichten.<b>"" </b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/784533/files/20140812225243-Rentiere.jpg?1407909163"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><br/></div>
<ul><li>Der zweite Text nennt sich Hestar í Hornafirði und berichtet über die Zuchtlinie des Islandpferdes im Südosten Islands, in Gebiet Hornafjörður.</li></ul>
<div>
<b>""</b> Hornafjörður ist wie bereits bekannt eine Gemeinde im Südosten Islands, aus der auch eine Zuchtlinie entsprungen ist.
<p>Das Gebiet rund um und im Hornafjörður ist vom Gletscher Vatnajökull und dessen Gletscherzungen geprägt. Durch die unzähligen Schmelzwasserflüsse ist dieses Gebiet regelrecht vom Rest Islands abgeschnitten. Erst seit es Brücken gibt, kommt man problemlos von A nach B.</p>
<p>Bevor es Brücken, Autos und andere moderne Fortbewegungsmittel gab, war man auf die Pferde angewiesen, um über die Flüsse zu gelangen.</p>
<p>Schon als Fohlen wurde den Hornafjörður-Pferden das Schwimmen beigebracht. Man ging mit den Muttertieren und den Jungtieren in Gewässer und schwamm immer wieder ein Stück. So lange, bis das Schwimmen so etwas Natürliches wie Laufen war.</p>
<p>Somit konnte man, wenn man zu einem Gebiet außerhalb des Hornafjörður wollte, über das Land reiten und über die Flüsse auf dem Pferderücken schwimmen.</p>
<p>Der Körper der Pferde war kräftig und hochgewachsen. Dies ist auf die Bewältigung der schwierigen Hindernisse zurückzuführen. Denn war ein Pferd groß, dann musste es möglicherweise gar nicht durch den Fluss schwimmen, sondern konnte durchgehen.</p>
<p>Die Pferde aus dem Hornafjörður waren regelrechte Wasserratten.</p>
<p>Eine Stute aus dem Gebiet des Hornafjörðurs wurde verkauft und sollte mit dem Schiff in die neue Heimat gebracht werden.</p>
<p>Nach einer langen Autoreise von über 500 Kilometern von Hornafjörður bis Reykjavik wurde diese Stute mit vielen anderen Pferden, die exportiert werden sollten, auf ein Schiff gebracht.</p>
<p>Das Schiff legte vom Hafen ab und fuhr auf die offene See hinaus. Nach einigen Kilometern Fahrt geschah etwas, das eigentlich kein Problem darstellen sollte: die Stute riss aus dem Container, in dem sie unterbracht war, aus und lief auf dem Schiff umher. So etwas geschah schon mal und war nichts Dramatisches, denn das Pferd wurde einfach wieder eingefangen. Auf einem begrenzten Raum wie auf einem Schiff war dies eine einfache Angelegenheit.</p>
<p>Die Stute fand es jedoch nicht so toll, dass Menschen auf sie zukamen und sie in die Ecke trieben. Panisch suchte sie einen Ausweg, um sich nicht von den Angst einjagenden Personen gefangen nehmen zu lassen.</p>
<p>Plötzlich lief die Stute flink zwischen den Menschen hindurch, nahm Anlauf und sprang über die Reling ins offene Meer – viele Kilometer entfernt vom Land.</p>
<p>Weil die Hornafjörður-Stute keine Scheu vor dem Wasser und dem damit verbundenen Schwimmen hatte, schwamm sie ganz gemütlich zurück – in Richtung Land.</p>
<p>Als sie kurz vor der Küste war, schwamm sie nicht bis zu dieser und ging auf das Land, sondern schlug in Richtung Osten (also Richtung Hornafjörður) ein und schwamm entlang der Küste viele Kilometer weiter. Erst als sie keine Lust mehr zum Schwimmen hatte, ging sie auf das Festland, um zu fressen und schlafen. Nach einer Weile setzte sie dann ihre Reise fort.</p>
<p>Manchmal ging sie auf dem Land, manchmal schwamm sie entlang der Küste, bis sie nach vielen Tagen wieder bei ihrem Besitzer ankam – dem die Kinnlade hinunter fiel, als er sein als ertrunken geltendes Pferd vor sich stehen sah. <b>""</b></p>

About
Hinter dem ganzen Buch - angefangen von der Grundidee über die Fotografien, Texte, Layout und Grafik bis zu der Vermarktung - stehe ich, Eva Frischling, selbstständige Fotografin und Islandnarr aus Salzburg / Österreich.
Angefangen hat alles mit einem harmlosen Islandaufenthalt, der dann so viel mehr war als ich mir vorstellte. Also konnte ich nicht anders als die wunderbaren Momente festhalten und die Geschichten dazu in der ganzen Welt verteilen.


Erstauflage

Das Buch wird mit einer Erstauflage von 500 Stück auf Deutsch erscheinen - hochwertig hergestellt wie ein Bildband auch sein soll. So etwas kostet aber auch, und deshalb bin ich auf euch angewiesen.
   Kosten Ihr alle könnt mir helfen, einen Teil der Druckkosten abzudecken und so meinenTraum von Island zu verwirklichen.
Die Druckkosten für die erste Auflage beziehen sich auf ca. 7.000 Euro, also rund 9.400 USD.
Wird das finanzielle Ziel bei Indiegogo erreicht, dann sind ca. 4.000 Euro, also 5.400 USD, in der Tasche, und der Druck kann sofort beginnen.
Wird das Funding-Ziel von den 5.400 USD nicht erreicht, dann wird das Projekt trotzdem umgesetzt. Es ist zwar schwieriger, aber nicht unmöglich. Die Finanzmittel die bis dahin eingelangt sind, gehen selbstverständlich direkt in die Druckkosten-Sparkasse über. Als Gegenzug für euer Geld bekommt ihr sogenannte ""Perks"". Die Perks für ""Lebensgefühl Island"" gehen von Postkarten und Kunstdrucke über ein auf Glas geprintetes  Panoramabild bis hin zu den Bildbänden.

  Einblick in das Buch Um eine bessere Vorstellung von dem Buch zu bekommen, gibt es hier das Buchcover und zwei Texte inkl. Layout:



Der erste Text nennt sich Hreindýr - also Rentiere:


"" Wie bekannt, gibt es in Island 13 Weihnachtsmänner. Ob es jetzt purer Zufall ist oder eine arrangierte Sache, dass im Jahre 1771 genau 13 Rentiere aus Skandinavien importiert wurden, wird wohl unbeantwortet bleiben.
Fakt ist jedoch, dass diese Rentiere nach Island geholt wurden, um vermehrt zu werden und als zusätzliche Nahrungsquelle zu dienen.
Erst nach 87 Jahren war die Population dieser Tiere so hoch, dass sie durch ein Jagdgesetz zum Abschuss freigegeben werden konnten.
Weil diese Tiere jedoch keinen großen Beitrag zur Nahrungsversorgung darstellten, eher schon eine Belastung waren, da sie immer in großen Herden ankamen und alles niedertrampelten, wurden alle Rentiere in den östlichen Teil der Insel verjagt. Dort sind heute noch ca. 3000 Exemplare zu Hause. Den Sommer verbringen sie in den Bergen und sind für kaum jemanden zu Gesicht zu bekommen. Im Winter jedoch, wenn das Futter auf der hohen Lage wenig wird, kommen sie ins Tal und treiben dort ihr Unwesen: sie springen über alle Zäune und reißen diese auch teilweise nieder, zertrampeln die Wiesen und Acker und fressen die übrig gebliebene Ernte bis zur Wurzel ab.
Nichts desto trotz ist es ein einmaliges Erlebnis auf der Ringstraße zu fahren und neben sich Hunderte von diesen stolzen, riesengroßen Tieren mit atemberaubenden Geweihen zu sichten."" 


Der zweite Text nennt sich Hestar í Hornafirði und berichtet über die Zuchtlinie des Islandpferdes im Südosten Islands, in Gebiet Hornafjörður.

"" Hornafjörður ist wie bereits bekannt eine Gemeinde im Südosten Islands, aus der auch eine Zuchtlinie entsprungen ist.
Das Gebiet rund um und im Hornafjörður ist vom Gletscher Vatnajökull und dessen Gletscherzungen geprägt. Durch die unzähligen Schmelzwasserflüsse ist dieses Gebiet regelrecht vom Rest Islands abgeschnitten. Erst seit es Brücken gibt, kommt man problemlos von A nach B.
Bevor es Brücken, Autos und andere moderne Fortbewegungsmittel gab, war man auf die Pferde angewiesen, um über die Flüsse zu gelangen.
Schon als Fohlen wurde den Hornafjörður-Pferden das Schwimmen beigebracht. Man ging mit den Muttertieren und den Jungtieren in Gewässer und schwamm immer wieder ein Stück. So lange, bis das Schwimmen so etwas Natürliches wie Laufen war.
Somit konnte man, wenn man zu einem Gebiet außerhalb des Hornafjörður wollte, über das Land reiten und über die Flüsse auf dem Pferderücken schwimmen.
Der Körper der Pferde war kräftig und hochgewachsen. Dies ist auf die Bewältigung der schwierigen Hindernisse zurückzuführen. Denn war ein Pferd groß, dann musste es möglicherweise gar nicht durch den Fluss schwimmen, sondern konnte durchgehen.
Die Pferde aus dem Hornafjörður waren regelrechte Wasserratten.
Eine Stute aus dem Gebiet des Hornafjörðurs wurde verkauft und sollte mit dem Schiff in die neue Heimat gebracht werden.
Nach einer langen Autoreise von über 500 Kilometern von Hornafjörður bis Reykjavik wurde diese Stute mit vielen anderen Pferden, die exportiert werden sollten, auf ein Schiff gebracht.
Das Schiff legte vom Hafen ab und fuhr auf die offene See hinaus. Nach einigen Kilometern Fahrt geschah etwas, das eigentlich kein Problem darstellen sollte: die Stute riss aus dem Container, in dem sie unterbracht war, aus und lief auf dem Schiff umher. So etwas geschah schon mal und war nichts Dramatisches, denn das Pferd wurde einfach wieder eingefangen. Auf einem begrenzten Raum wie auf einem Schiff war dies eine einfache Angelegenheit.
Die Stute fand es jedoch nicht so toll, dass Menschen auf sie zukamen und sie in die Ecke trieben. Panisch suchte sie einen Ausweg, um sich nicht von den Angst einjagenden Personen gefangen nehmen zu lassen.
Plötzlich lief die Stute flink zwischen den Menschen hindurch, nahm Anlauf und sprang über die Reling ins offene Meer – viele Kilometer entfernt vom Land.
Weil die Hornafjörður-Stute keine Scheu vor dem Wasser und dem damit verbundenen Schwimmen hatte, schwamm sie ganz gemütlich zurück – in Richtung Land.
Als sie kurz vor der Küste war, schwamm sie nicht bis zu dieser und ging auf das Land, sondern schlug in Richtung Osten (also Richtung Hornafjörður) ein und schwamm entlang der Küste viele Kilometer weiter. Erst als sie keine Lust mehr zum Schwimmen hatte, ging sie auf das Festland, um zu fressen und schlafen. Nach einer Weile setzte sie dann ihre Reise fort.
Manchmal ging sie auf dem Land, manchmal schwamm sie entlang der Küste, bis sie nach vielen Tagen wieder bei ihrem Besitzer ankam – dem die Kinnlade hinunter fiel, als er sein als ertrunken geltendes Pferd vor sich stehen sah. ""




Herausforderungen, Augenmerke und weitere Aktivitäten
 Dieses Projekt hat eine enorm große Herausforderung an mich gestellt. Es gehört so viel mehr dazu als nur fotografieren und schreiben, um ein erfolgreiches Buch heraus zu bringen. Irgendwann kam der Punkt, an dem ich realisierte, wie viel Arbeit das alles war und stand somit am Scheidepunkt von zwei Entscheidungen: mache ich das Buch so wie ich gerade Lust darauf habe und bringe ein gute Buch heraus, das sicher den meisten gefällt, oder hole ich das Beste aus allem heraus, so dass es nicht nur gut oder perfekt ist, sondern perfektioniert in allen Arbeitsrichtungen ist?
Ich hab mich für die zweite Möglichkeit entschieden.  Von da an war keine Nacht zu kurz und keine Arbeit zu viel. 
Das Hauptaugenmerk wurden darauf gelegt, dass das Buch für wirklich jeden interessant ist. Egal wie gut er sich bis jetzt mit Island auskennt, ob er überhaupt einen Bezug zu der Insel hat oder schon sein ganzes Leben dort lebt. Die Texte sind einfach geschrieben und sehr unterhaltsam. Da das Buch in viele Kapitel aufgeteilt ist, kann man die Texte nach und nach lesen - so wie man Zeit hat - oder alles auf einmal in sich saugen.
Der nächste Schritt, wenn das Buch in der Erstausgabe aufgelegt ist, wird das Übersetzen auf Englisch und Isländisch sein.

Vermutlich werden sich viele angesprochen fühlen, und dieses Projekt unterstützen wollen, aber es wird nicht jeder das nötige Kleingeld parat haben, um dies auch in diesem Sinne zu tun.Es muss aber nicht immer Geld sein um zu helfen, denn ein wichtiger Teil um zu dem Endergebnis zu kommen, ist, das Projekt unter so vielen Leuten wie nur möglich zu verbreiten.

<p>I am a Computer Scientist with an artistic passion. I have had the privilege to have my education across three continents (BE- India, MS- USA, PhD - Netherlands). Being a researcher, I get to travel across the world for various professional activities. I consider myself fortunate to have witnessed different cultures during these travels. <span>Being a scientist, I am a keen observer of the world around me, and always try to reason my observations. Photography allows me to capture my observations through the precise moments.</span></p>
<p><b>Photography credentials - </b>Being an avid painter (all India level gold medalist) during school days, I have a great eye for photo composition. I am a self taught photographer. I have contributed my photographs to exhibition in Istanbul, front covers of a UK based book publisher, coffee table book editorials in India, Getty image invitations for stock photography, friend's wedding albums in Netherlands and India, my scientific institute's magazine and library archives in Amsterdam. </p>

<h3><span>                               What do you get?</span></h3>
<p>My ultimate aim is to share my experiences of witnessing the beauty across various cultures, through my photographic journeys, in the form of a beautiful photo-book.  Each book is printed individually from the individual contributor's contribution, so the funding goal is just to make sure that the book reaches as many people as possible.</p>
<p><b>The book conveys a strong socio-economic message comparing different cultures, to create public awareness. I have been actively involved in related work in the past, and want my photos to narrate these stories. 1% of the amount raised after all the expenditure deductions will be donated to this campaign on Indiegogo to improve the Indian farmer's crisis. </b></p>

<p><b>The photo-book is an ideal gift for <b>socio-economic-thinkers, </b>cultural explorers, <b>travel lovers, and </b>architecture lovers, as the festive season approaches. It could be also used as a coffee-table book.</b> Some of the photo-stories could be very intriguing and will definitely leave you pondering, and question the way societies across the world function, especially from socio-economic perspective. So essentially, you get some food for thought. The stories might also inspire you to visit these new places, or might bring back those fond memories, if been there already. </p>
<p><b>Costs - </b>Book publishing through crowdfunding is a tremendous collaborative effort from the conception of the idea until it reaches its audience in its final form. After meticulous planning I have managed to keep various costs involved such as DTP, proof-reading, printing, marketing, distributing, shipping, the Indiegogo platform  fees and credit / debit card fees, to their minimum. </p>
<p><b>However, I can not do the publication process without your valuable contributions. By pledging your support, you are going to become a part of this unique experience, to create such a unique document covering diverse locations with their cultural and natural world juxtapositions. </b></p>

</div></div>","Even though the campaign has ended, still you can order your copy by                                                            selecting a perk below. 
        Order your own collage, gift it during the festive season, and follow our                                                     journey through cultures!
    Update:-  All the books have been delivered to their happy contributors. 



Though cultures differ, the humanity across the world is still bound by a common thread of kindness, helpfulness, love, and various such qualities.
Though natural and manmade beauties such as bodies of water, forests, mountains, institutes of learning, architectures change across different geographical boundaries, similarities can still be found in their abstract forms.  
The world is like a large collage connected through the threads binding the humanity, the natural and the manmade schemes in their different manifestations. 
Having witnessed these amazing stories across the world, I feel a strong urge to share the experience with a larger audience. A photo-book depicting a collage of these stories with different progressive themes feels like the right step. While the stories progress, I crave for similarities and contrasts between them. 


             


I am a Computer Scientist with an artistic passion. I have had the privilege to have my education across three continents (BE- India, MS- USA, PhD - Netherlands). Being a researcher, I get to travel across the world for various professional activities. I consider myself fortunate to have witnessed different cultures during these travels. Being a scientist, I am a keen observer of the world around me, and always try to reason my observations. Photography allows me to capture my observations through the precise moments.
Photography credentials - Being an avid painter (all India level gold medalist) during school days, I have a great eye for photo composition. I am a self taught photographer. I have contributed my photographs to exhibition in Istanbul, front covers of a UK based book publisher, coffee table book editorials in India, Getty image invitations for stock photography, friend's wedding albums in Netherlands and India, my scientific institute's magazine and library archives in Amsterdam. 
                   
                               What do you get?
My ultimate aim is to share my experiences of witnessing the beauty across various cultures, through my photographic journeys, in the form of a beautiful photo-book.  Each book is printed individually from the individual contributor's contribution, so the funding goal is just to make sure that the book reaches as many people as possible.
The book conveys a strong socio-economic message comparing different cultures, to create public awareness. I have been actively involved in related work in the past, and want my photos to narrate these stories. 1% of the amount raised after all the expenditure deductions will be donated to this campaign on Indiegogo to improve the Indian farmer's crisis. 
1 farmer commits suicide in India every 30 minutes. 250,000+ farmer  suicides in 15 years.
https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/save-indian-farmers-yes-you-can/x/11621885#/  
The photo-book is an ideal gift for socio-economic-thinkers, cultural explorers, travel lovers, and architecture lovers, as the festive season approaches. It could be also used as a coffee-table book. Some of the photo-stories could be very intriguing and will definitely leave you pondering, and question the way societies across the world function, especially from socio-economic perspective. So essentially, you get some food for thought. The stories might also inspire you to visit these new places, or might bring back those fond memories, if been there already. 
Costs - Book publishing through crowdfunding is a tremendous collaborative effort from the conception of the idea until it reaches its audience in its final form. After meticulous planning I have managed to keep various costs involved such as DTP, proof-reading, printing, marketing, distributing, shipping, the Indiegogo platform  fees and credit / debit card fees, to their minimum. 
However, I can not do the publication process without your valuable contributions. By pledging your support, you are going to become a part of this unique experience, to create such a unique document covering diverse locations with their cultural and natural world juxtapositions. 
In return for your help you get to choose from the photo-book, the e-book, and other form of rewards (perks) as listed on the right section of this web-page. 


Expect the best- While the snapshots from the book's first draft copy are showcased below, an almost final proof copy of the book is getting ready.  The book incorporates feedback from artists, designers, writers, and researchers. It has gone through multiple design revisions, and proof-reads. The sample images showcased below (and in the Gallery tab) offer a glimpse into the quality of the photographs. So expect the best. Be ready to be intrigued.  

My sincere thanks that you are reading this. Please pledge your support, contribute, share and let the word spread amongst your friends on the social media, so that the campaign turns out to be a huge success. Be a part of this success. 
The rest of the section provides more details about the photo-book and its contents.
                        Photo-book specifications 

The book has a soft cover with matte finish. It contains 146 pages in 8.5 x 11 inches (almost A4) calendar  style landscape format, with 1 photo per page, printed on 60-pound smooth white offset paper. Each photo has a descriptive caption that gives a unique perspective of the story being told in a concise manner. 

  Some preview snapshots from the book's draft copy under revision are here.  




In the final book copy the captions will appear below the images, have a different font, size, color, alignment, and are more descriptive.



                          The photo-book theme 
The photo-book exhibits the juxtaposed collection of photos from my travels across selected places from the four continents (Australia, Asia, Europe, and North America). The images below offer a glimpse into the offering, as the theme progresses. 
Humanity in its various forms across different cultures as could be witnessed with daily activities of people doing business, prayers, policing, protesting, entertaining, having fun.  


The power of people- The awareness march at Marine Drive in Mumbai, India after 26/11 terrorist attacks that killed 164 people. India has been witnessing many civic movements targeting corruption, violence against women, in recent years, lead by its strong civil society organizations.

Cities host the majority of the world population where its inhabitants live and work. The look and feel of the cities symbolizes the quality of life on the offer to its citizens. 


Monaco- The richest city state, sandwiched between Italy and France, with an area of around 2.02 square km. It has the highest density of world's millionaires and billionaires.  
Architecture- Since centuries cities have served as a platform to exhibit the craftsmanship of its inhibitors.  Most cities tend to have architectural marvels that define their identity on the global map. 

Gopuram - The monumental tower entrance to the South Indian temples. The wall carvings portray the Hindu mythological stories. 
Oceans occupy 71% of the earth's surface area and form one of the most important links in the survival of life on the earth. The book covers the life around the beaches across the three main oceans, the Pacific, the Atlantic, and the Indian ocean. It also covers the beaches across the Mediterranean sea, the Arabian sea, and other water bodies such as the Bosphorous in Istanbul, Lake Tahoe in California, Kerala backwaters in India, etc.   

               The sea fountain at Santa Cruz, California. 

The roads act as culture connectors and symbolize the societal progress, allowing the seamless movements of people and goods across geographical boundaries.  This section of the book depicts roads in various shapes, sizes, and forms, as they span across cultural and geographical boundaries. 




       The long road to India’s remote places, in the greens. India has less                     than 3.8 kilometers of roads per 1000 people. For context, United States           has 21 kilometers of roads, while France has 15 kilometers of  roads per               1000 people. 



Transportation- The ability to move across the geographical boundaries using different modes of transportation made numerous explorations possible. The book portrays different such possible modes of transportation in different contexts.



The agility matters - Ferry boat vs police patrol boat in Bosphorous, Istanbul.  Bosphorous is a strait that separates Europe and Asia in Istanbul. It is amazingly beautiful.

<p>We are the Dawson College Commercial Photography Graduates of Winter 2012. The goal of this program is to give graduating students the technical, visual &amp; business skills to perform commercial tasks typically done by self-employed or staff photographers in a manner that meets industry &amp; professional standards. We have been instructed in various aspects of professional photography including advertising &amp; editorial illustration, portraiture, catalogue photography, architectural photography, fashion photography, industrial photography &amp; digital imaging. In courses designed to cover both theory &amp; practice, we learned to use small &amp; large format cameras, tungsten &amp; electronic flash for studio or location lighting, &amp; computer imaging software for output &amp; media applications. Throughout the program, a mature &amp; disciplined approach to commercial photography was emphasized &amp; at the same time, we were encouraged to develop a personal creative vision of the world.</p>

<p><strong>THE VERNISSAGE</strong></p>
<p>We have finally reached the culmination of all of our work – it is time to graduate, &amp; exhibit our work to friends, fans, potential clients &amp; buyers.

<h3>Limited-edition Hawaii landscape print sale benefiting Aloha Harvest</h3>
<p>100% of net proceeds will be donated to Aloha Harvest.</p>
<p><br/>The COVID-19 crisis has deeply affected Hawaii. Due to our tourism industry shutdown, our state has a 22% unemployment rate — the second highest in the nation. Aloha Harvest is one of the many amazing nonprofits who have stepped up to support Hawaii's needy and hungry families.</p>
<p><br/><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>I created this project as a way to support Aloha Harvest. I’m selling a limited edition of 100 prints, featuring twelve of my favorite Hawaii landscape photographs.</p>
<p>The photographs are richly detailed and of the highest quality, taken with a medium format Fujifilm GFX 50s camera. I'm printing these images on 17 X 22” archival paper with a Canon imagePROGRAF PRO-1000. The total number of prints will be limited to 100.</p>
<p>Individual prints are priced at $75, with a set of two for $140.</p>
<p>100% of net proceeds will be donated to Aloha Harvest.</p>
<p>At the end of the campaign, I'll send out a survey and you may choose any of the images below.</p>

<p>Now in its 21st year, Aloha Harvest is the largest food rescue and redistribution organization in Hawaii. A 501c3 nonprofit, Aloha Harvest picks up excess food from more than 250 donors and delivers it to more than 175 agencies that feed the hungry per year. All of their services are provided free of charge to both donors and recipients. Food donors include grocery stores, wholesale distributors, and restaurants. Food recipients include social service agencies, nonprofits, rehabilitation shelters, and food pantries. COVID-19 has intensified food insecurity in our state, making their work especially critical.

100% of net proceeds will be donated to Aloha Harvest.
The COVID-19 crisis has deeply affected Hawaii. Due to our tourism industry shutdown, our state has a 22% unemployment rate — the second highest in the nation. Aloha Harvest is one of the many amazing nonprofits who have stepped up to support Hawaii's needy and hungry families.
The Project
I created this project as a way to support Aloha Harvest. I’m selling a limited edition of 100 prints, featuring twelve of my favorite Hawaii landscape photographs.
The photographs are richly detailed and of the highest quality, taken with a medium format Fujifilm GFX 50s camera. I'm printing these images on 17 X 22” archival paper with a Canon imagePROGRAF PRO-1000. The total number of prints will be limited to 100.
Individual prints are priced at $75, with a set of two for $140.
100% of net proceeds will be donated to Aloha Harvest.
At the end of the campaign, I'll send out a survey and you may choose any of the images below.

Pololu Valley, Hawaii Island​

You can now purchase it at <a href=""http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/2078686"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/2078686</a>. All of it was funded by me.</p>

It will also have tutorials, convention lists, articles, photography and other cosplay related stuff. We hope that it will be ready by Sakura Con 2013. Then we will be selling it every convention we go to, which is about 4-6 cons a year.</p>
<p>This time I do not have to funds to print the book and so I’ve turned to Indiegogo to get some help. Your contribution goes towards printing the book which will also help keep my costs down for the resale and I need funds to be able to sell the book at a convention.</p>

<p>About Me:</p>
<p>My name is Danielle but I always introduce myself as Dea since that is what my friends call me and that is the name I love. I’ve been a casual cosplayer for 10years (only one costume and con a year) only in the last 3years have I been doing 4-6 costumes and cons a year. I first stated out with being in front of my camera but then I wasn’t too happy with the sets my photographer was doing so I decided to be the photographer and I loved it more. So in order to help me be a better photographer and get my name out there I created NW Cosplay and started to do personal photo shoots and photo shoots at conventions. My greatest joy in life is to cosplay, to take photos of cosplayers and going to conventions and I want to share that with the world.

Our courses tend to produce work that sits more comfortably toward the fine art end of the creative spectrum while still embedding the vocational skills integral to the independent fulfillment of such creative endeavours. Alumni have gone on to win the Bar Tur photobook award, the Leica newcommer photography award and many more, as well as exhibiting in the Folkestone Triennial, Why Free Range?Free Range has become an integral aspect of the photography course at UCA Rochester, offering new graduates the celebration and recognition their work deserves. Comprised of 18 universities from across the country, the atmosphere of creative talent and potential acts as a strong draw for many figureheads within the photographic and creative arts world. Past exhibitors from UCA Rochester have gone on to exhibit in shows in China, New Zealand and across the UK; others have been published in i-D, The British Journal of Photography and Portrait Salon; others have even gone on to sign contracts with galleries and leading agencies - all as a direct result of showcasing their work at Free Range.Blind Book SaleFor the first time in our history of fundraising, we have decided to offer backers the opportunity to own some fabulous photobooks for a fraction of their value. We have received donations of bumped, returned, signed and rare books from photobookstore, MACK books and Mörel books, many of which are out of print. With so much choice we thought it'd be kind of us to assist with the decision making by introducing an element of chance.

<h3>Introduction </h3>
<p>Since
the dawn of photography and its evolution, photography has come a
long way. The time  of going into the darkroom to process and print
our image has passed (although that was fun and we still do it from
time to time). Today the ability to do all of that is now in
something as small and as powerful as a smart phone. <br/><br/>To
celebrate this new technology, five photographers with very different
cultural backgrounds  - Asian, European, Latin American have
organized  the “#BMP Exhibition” by Bangkok Mobile Photographers
as a part of the “Siam Project”. <br/><br/>One city connects us,
these five photographers: Bangkok. We will present our version of
what we see in Bangkok under the following hash tags: #abstract, the
#comical, or the #strange.<br/><br/>The exhibition will take place at
the Neilson Hays Library, Suriwong Road in Bangkok from January 6-
25, 2015, Opening reception on January 8, 2015.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What we seek for funding<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>
The
exhibition will present 50 pictures (10 by each photographer), that
have been taken  and mostly edited on a smartphone or a mobile
device. For the exhibition, they will be printed on high quality
paper at the size of 20 cm x 20 cm (8 inch x 8 inch) and framed in 40
cm x 40 cm  frames for display. 
</p>
<p>
Press,
Public Relations material and Information material will be produced
and sent out to news outlets. The materials will include a pamphlet
about us and the exhibition, postcards, posters and a catalog. They
need to be designed, printed in high quality and sent out to
newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>
And
there will be an opening reception on January 8, 2015, which needs
support for food, drinks and (live?) music.</p>
<p>
Right
now, our budget consists of our own private money, so any funding we
can raise through Indiegogo will help us not only alleviate the cost
for ourselves, but also to make the exhibition a bigger event,
especially the opening reception.</p>
<p>
All
money that we raise above our goal will be invested into opening
reception, and possibly into the next exhibition by #BMP and the Siam
Project.</p>

First for a biopsy and CT and since they had a time slot available for surgery the day after (cheaper for me) they have now also performed the surgery. They think the outgrowth in her ear is a polyp, which is removable, and it was rooted only in the outer ear which lead to an easier procedure than if it had been rooted further in. She will now eat pills for 20 days and next week we will do a check up on her wound. Final cost seems to be around 730$ 

Update 15/12: Nefertiti's wound from the surgery is healing up perfectly and everything is paid and done. We still don't know exactly what it was in her ear and hope to get specific answers any day now. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP!Pic from our visit at the veterinary before they investigated her: After the veterinary, she is very very close all the time because the cone makes her feel weak :PAll prints are ordered once a payment is received and will be dispatched asap.To check all available prints, you can go to: http://kyawolfwritten.deviantart.com/ or https://www.facebook.com/KyaWolfwrittenSome of all available prints are seen in the gallery here on Indiegogo too.Thank you in advance!All LoveKya",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

2001 wurde von den Flying Piston Studios Berlin das Magazin Smokin’ Shutdown ins Leben gerufen. Zu dieser Zeit gab es keine Hot Rod Szene, keine Kustom Kulture Szene, ein Magazin schon gar nicht.

<h3> Chicago, Philly, Portland, LA &amp; Kansas City Dates are now open!</h3>
<p><span>The 4th Trimester Bodies Project is an ongoing photo documentary created by Chicago photographer and mother of three, Ashlee Wells Jackson. </span>This project is dedicated to embracing the beauty inherent in the changes brought to our bodies by motherhood, childbirth and breastfeeding.</p>
<p>What started as a passion project for Ashlee to learn to accept the physical aftermath of a traumatic pregnancy and birth experience has become a platform to encourage all mothers to love and accept the stretches, scars and stripes that come from bearing and raising our little loves. </p>
<p>We are currently photographing women in and around the Chicago area and hope to soon travel to additional cities in order to include a larger and more diverse group of women. The end goal of this project is a community website, gallery show and ultimately, a published book of collected stories and captured photographs. </p>
<p>We hope to change the way women look at their physical selves postpartum and by supporting this project you're helping us do just that. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We need to raise a bare minimum of $35k to make this whole project a reality.We will be traveling across the country to capture women in their best light (with no post processing other than color adjustments). Here is a brief breakdown of costs:</p>
<p>1. Travel, studio rentals, assistants, hair and make up artists and transporting gear all require funding.</p>
<p>2. We will be self publishing the final product which requires a significant budget.</p>
<p>3. It costs money to edit, copyedit, typeset, and design a book—even before you actually print and ship the copies—and photography books require the right kind of paperstock and printing expertise to show the photos in their best light.</p>
<p>By asking you to buy your copy or copies <em>before</em> they're printed, we not only make sure we don't waste paper by printing exactly the number we need, but we save money.</p>
<p>If we don't meet our funding we will have to cancel the travel portion of this project. However, if we meet or exceed our budget any additional funding will allow us to expand our travel schedule including even more women in the project. We will be able to print more books and invest even more money in our beautiful community. </p>
<p>We’re offering many ways in which you can invest in this project. Have a look and thanks so much for taking part!</p>
<p>Not able to fund this project at the moment but want to help anyway? Please share this campaign widely. Let every parent, woman, grandmother, aunt and compassionate person you know about this exciting project. Help us make some noise!</p>
<p>If you'd like to participate please email us! 4thTrimesterBodies@gmail.com </p>

2. We will be self publishing the final product which requires a significant budget.
3. It costs money to edit, copyedit, typeset, and design a book—even before you actually print and ship the copies—and photography books require the right kind of paperstock and printing expertise to show the photos in their best light.
By asking you to buy your copy or copies before they're printed, we not only make sure we don't waste paper by printing exactly the number we need, but we save money.
If we don't meet our funding we will have to cancel the travel portion of this project. However, if we meet or exceed our budget any additional funding will allow us to expand our travel schedule including even more women in the project. We will be able to print more books and invest even more money in our beautiful community. 
We’re offering many ways in which you can invest in this project. Have a look and thanks so much for taking part!
Not able to fund this project at the moment but want to help anyway? Please share this campaign widely. Let every parent, woman, grandmother, aunt and compassionate person you know about this exciting project. Help us make some noise!

</div></div>","The Important Story
Get published without any money is not so easy in these days. In Czech Republic does not exist publishers or organisations supporting young (and not so well-known) photographers in making books. Also to get a grant to self-publish a book is almost impossible without back up of any big organisation. Due to this I decided to self-publish the Disturbation photos.

The Disturbation is shot on middle format analogue camera so the whole project is quite expensive. The amount of money I was able to give to the project is a half of full price. I need your help with another half to realised the remaining photos and to make a book.

More about my plans and visions available in MULL IT OVER interview.


Artist statement for Disturbation
In the recent series I retell in pictures several stories that should never be seen. The photos capture different people during various intimate situations in a ""caught in the act"" way. It made us unwanted spectators of strange rituals and obscure moments as simply everyday routine. Because it is. But 'disturbation' is not artless opening of locked or semi-closed doors to children's rooms, toilets or massage salons. Forget voyeurism and fetishism cliché. These photos aspire to reflect not just actual social issues. Politics, pop icons, pope... Therefore to speak only about intimacy as an act is deficient. It is also about what people hide inside themselves. In their inner space full of opinions, attitudes, thoughts, dreams and taste. It represent a study of privacy. Because privacy is where the most of the global problems rise from. Undercover, unobtrusively. That's why 'disturbation' is here. To think about this fact. 
Although most of the visual stories are mockumentary or reconstruction of true and sometimes false memories, the rest remains truly authentic.
The final collection will be presented as a book and exhibition in the first half of 2012.

View the already published photos of Disturbation on MY SITE. 

The Impact

With your help I'm going to complete the collection of photos and make a serious photo publication that will support the exhibition in the first half of 2012. It will help to spread the concept in physicl way to the wide audience and represent the state of contemporary photography in photo/book fairs and shops. The money earned from retail will help to finance the other projects of mine.


What We Need
I need 8900$ to finish the project. Yea, it's a lot. But I want to make it the best I can. The best for you all who help me make it happened. I need to create shots that are still only in my mind and then bind it all together in a beautiful book.

<h3><strong>Project Background</strong></h3>
<p>Photography is an avenue for learning about the planet around you.<br/>For as long as I have been a photographer, I have made the study and photography of liquids my passion. <br/>This type of photography has taught me more than I could have imagined about light, fluid physics, water and how we see the world infront of us. <br/>This book is the culmination of all my liquid photography projects. I want to share the beauty of these rare moments, in a book that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/2qkJrOM.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;""/> </p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>The book is currently set to the following:</p>
<p><strong>Product:</strong> Coil Bound Book<br/><strong>Coil colour:</strong> Black<br/><strong>Number of pages:</strong> 60<br/><strong>Size:</strong> A4<br/><strong>Colour/BW:</strong> Colour<br/><strong>Inside Pages:</strong> 115gsm Gloss<br/><strong>Cover thickness:</strong> 300gsm<br/><strong>Cover finish:</strong> Gloss<br/><strong>Portrait/landscape:</strong> Landscape</p>
<p>The book will contain the finest specimens of my liquid photographs, and will have some beautiful quotes to go along with them.<br/> </p>
<h3>Why Water?</h3>
<p>Water: Natures Miracle, life giving, makes up over 50% of our bodies, and stunning to look at under these circumstances.<br/><br/></p>
<p>Using a studio setup, an old paint tray, and some fresh water, you can produce an image which sparks your imagination and seems so magical.</p>
<p>Sitting in an uncomfortable position, waiting to capture that moment might make some of you think I am a little crazy.<br/>Personally I think it all pays off in the end, when you can produce something so awesome to look at.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/oFb13Pz.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;""/></p>
<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>The book will be created by one of the UK's leading book printers, on high quality paper to really make my images pop.<br/> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I need the funds to publish the book, and without your support it simply can't happen.<br/> By purchasing a copy of the book through this IndieGoGo campaign, you will help in the book's creation, and helping an aspiring artist to get his work out there!<br/>I will need to apply for an ISBN (so I can retail them in shops) and get a barcode created, that runs at around £75-100, so I really do need every penny.</p>
<p>Without your help, all I can do is offer scattered images throughout the internet, this will make it possible to show it to a whole new audience.<br/>I would love to have this published and in every library out there, on every coffee table, having people enjoy the work I strive so hard to create. <br/><br/></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/IbvTBPW.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;""/></p>
<h3>Extra Perks</h3>
<p><strong>1080p Resolution Desktop Wallpapers:</strong> A selection of some of my favourite images, processed into a 1080p format ready for any monitor or desktop.</p>
<p><strong>A signed print of one of my photos:</strong> Never know, it could be worth alot of money in the future :P.<br/> </p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>If I receive more than the £750 in funding for my project, there are a few enhancements I'd like to do to the final product.<br/><br/>Perhaps hire a layout designer to improve the composition on each page, aswell as additional pages to host even more content and images.<br/>I would LOVE to produce more copies as well, the more funding I get, the more I can order, getting an even bigger discount.<br/>It would allow me to offer the book at major retail locations, and give copies away to libraries.<br/> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Get the word out! Share this campaign with everyone - at the very least they'll enjoy the liquid images.<br/> Spreading the message for this campaign is integral to its success, and I appreciate every little bit of help you can offer! </p>

By purchasing a copy of the book through this IndieGoGo campaign, you will help in the book's creation, and helping an aspiring artist to get his work out there!I will need to apply for an ISBN (so I can retail them in shops) and get a barcode created, that runs at around £75-100, so I really do need every penny.
Without your help, all I can do is offer scattered images throughout the internet, this will make it possible to show it to a whole new audience.I would love to have this published and in every library out there, on every coffee table, having people enjoy the work I strive so hard to create. 

Extra Perks
1080p Resolution Desktop Wallpapers: A selection of some of my favourite images, processed into a 1080p format ready for any monitor or desktop.
A signed print of one of my photos: Never know, it could be worth alot of money in the future :P. 
Stretch Goals
If I receive more than the £750 in funding for my project, there are a few enhancements I'd like to do to the final product.Perhaps hire a layout designer to improve the composition on each page, aswell as additional pages to host even more content and images.I would LOVE to produce more copies as well, the more funding I get, the more I can order, getting an even bigger discount.It would allow me to offer the book at major retail locations, and give copies away to libraries.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>I will be organizing a photographic workshop for a group of young local people involved in digital and internet media distribution focusing on political and social aspect of Saharawi people living in refugee camps in Algeria. </p>
<p>This project is a continuation of the previous one which was photographing and creating my first photographic book “40/the place which does not exist” about situation in the refugee camps in Algeria. Saharawi people have waited 40 years to return to their homeland of Western Sahara. A land occupied by Moroccans. Here is the latest BBC report: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38717078"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38717078</a></p>
<p>This project for me is the next step. The idea of making photographic workshop was in my mind from the time when I left camps while taking photos for the book. I want to support these young people and share all the knowledge I’ve got about photography because I believe that communicating about the situation of Saharawi people is extremely important especially for a young generation --  gives them hope that their voice still can be heard. If not the only solution for them to would be to go for a war. By organising this workshop I want to support non war solution.  </p>
<p>The group of young local people I will be working with is already very seriously engaged with information distribution about the situation of the Saharawi people. They focus on english speaking audience as the situation from that region (Western Sahara) is relatively unknown among english speaking countries. </p>
<p>The workshop will take place in Smara refugee camp close to Tindouf from 28 of February to 8 of March 2017. </p>

<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>This is non profit project and I am looking for people who could contribute to the costs of return flights from London to Tindouf in Algeria and also could help me to cover costs of accommodation when living in the camps. I need approximately £500 for the tickets and transportation and £300 to cover costs of living and accommodation.   In return I can offer prints and may photo book from the last trip to the camps. I enclose the selection of the images as well as the link to on line presentation of the book. <a href=""http://www.tomasz-laczny.com/3126755-publications#1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.tomasz-laczny.com/3126755-publications#1</a></p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>My aim is to trigger the development of the photographic skills of the participants which are already involved in digital distribution of the visual and written information about the situation in the camps and occupied territories of Western Sahara to the world.  I would like to develop their following skills: shooting, editing, storytelling using visual language, post production as well as more abstract understanding of the of the visual language eg composition, framing, negative space. I believe that the participants will use gained knowledge in real life shooting situation.</p>
<p>The outcome of the workshop will be shown as a slideshow during opening exhibition The Best German Photobook 2016 on 11 of March at Forum fur Fotografie Gallery in Cologne. The opening will start at 16.00 the address of the gallery:  </p>

</div><div><p> </p></div></div>","Short Summary
I will be organizing a photographic workshop for a group of young local people involved in digital and internet media distribution focusing on political and social aspect of Saharawi people living in refugee camps in Algeria. 
This project is a continuation of the previous one which was photographing and creating my first photographic book “40/the place which does not exist” about situation in the refugee camps in Algeria. Saharawi people have waited 40 years to return to their homeland of Western Sahara. A land occupied by Moroccans. Here is the latest BBC report: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38717078
This project for me is the next step. The idea of making photographic workshop was in my mind from the time when I left camps while taking photos for the book. I want to support these young people and share all the knowledge I’ve got about photography because I believe that communicating about the situation of Saharawi people is extremely important especially for a young generation --  gives them hope that their voice still can be heard. If not the only solution for them to would be to go for a war. By organising this workshop I want to support non war solution.  
The group of young local people I will be working with is already very seriously engaged with information distribution about the situation of the Saharawi people. They focus on english speaking audience as the situation from that region (Western Sahara) is relatively unknown among english speaking countries. 
The workshop will take place in Smara refugee camp close to Tindouf from 28 of February to 8 of March 2017. 

What I Need & What You Get
This is non profit project and I am looking for people who could contribute to the costs of return flights from London to Tindouf in Algeria and also could help me to cover costs of accommodation when living in the camps. I need approximately £500 for the tickets and transportation and £300 to cover costs of living and accommodation.   In return I can offer prints and may photo book from the last trip to the camps. I enclose the selection of the images as well as the link to on line presentation of the book. http://www.tomasz-laczny.com/3126755-publications#1

The Impact
My aim is to trigger the development of the photographic skills of the participants which are already involved in digital distribution of the visual and written information about the situation in the camps and occupied territories of Western Sahara to the world.  I would like to develop their following skills: shooting, editing, storytelling using visual language, post production as well as more abstract understanding of the of the visual language eg composition, framing, negative space. I believe that the participants will use gained knowledge in real life shooting situation.
The outcome of the workshop will be shown as a slideshow during opening exhibition The Best German Photobook 2016 on 11 of March at Forum fur Fotografie Gallery in Cologne. The opening will start at 16.00 the address of the gallery:  
Forum für Fotografie
Schönhauser Str. 850968 Köln
http://www.forum-fotografie.info
I will also post the slideshow on my webpage. http://www.tomasz-laczny.com

<h3>Tears</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My name is Jackson Cox, and I own Coffee Boy Photography. I've been doing photography and film for 6 years, since I was 14, and professionally for around a year now. The Tears project started with a Facebook message to Karen Lis, the owner of Icon makeup school asking whether her students might be interested in participating in a creative project. The response was overwhelming. 7 make up artists and over 30 models later, 'Tears' was finally finished... but I don't plan to stop here.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I want to get this project onto canvas and into an art gallery for public exhibition, but being the epitome of the starving artist, I cannot afford to do this and eat as well. If all goes well, this will be my first exhibition and definitely not the last.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are based in Newcastle and would love to see more projects like this here, it is often the hurdle of funding that many fall over and I don't wish to be one of those people this time. So I'm coming to you guys asking for $2000 to get them printed onto canvas, and to hire a space in a gallery.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you can't help out with pledges, please share amongst your friends and let them know what's going on. The more publicity we can get for this project the better.</p>

<h3>What we're doing</h3>
<p>My friend and I are travling the country for one month during the summer. We plan on going down the east coast, across the south, up the west, and across the north. We have a lot of driving to do, and there's so much of the country that I want to artistically capture with my camera.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>My name is Casey Robertson, and I am a photography student at SUNY New Paltz. I am currently concentrating in photographing Upstate New York. My idea with this trip is to take what I've learned from photographing this smaller area, and using it to my advantage while I photograph the country. You can find my work at <a href=""http://www.caseyrobertsonphoto.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.caseyrobertsonphoto.com</a></p>
<p>My friend who will be traveling with me is Anthony Raucci. He is a music major, and an amazing assitant who comes with me all the time while I work on my current project: Middle of Nowhere, New York</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money you donate will be going towards:</p>
<p>// 85% of the funds will be going towards the creation and publishing of a book that summarizes the photos I took during our trip. </p>
<p>// The remainder of the money will help us in our traveling; Gas, food, a place to stay for a night. We plan to keep our expenses to a minumum, which is why we are only using a small portion of the funds to help us personally.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Laura Cobb. I received a Bachelors of Fine art in photography from the Kansas City Art Institute in 2013.  Since then I have been applying to various juried shows and residencies, as well as other photographic opportunities. </p>
<p>Recently, I was awarded my first artist in residence at the Ucross Foundation in Wyoming!! I will be photographing the ranch lands and nature, the serene and the quiet qualities of the land, while exploring the connection and discord between humanity and the natural world. I believe if you are willing to listen the land can speak.</p>
<p> The residency will be about a month long. Lodging will be covered by the foundation, however supplies and travel are not. This is such an amazing opportunity! Being given the time and freedom to focus solely on art is a gift I cannot refuse. However, in order to attend, I had to make some tough decisions, including quitting my job. So, I am trying to raise money to cover expenses relating to attending, such as: gas, 4x5 and 8x10 film and other necessities, like rent and bills while I am gone and until I am working again.</p>
<p>As my way to thank everyone that donates and to show how very much I appreciate every little bit, I am going to be gifting some of my favorite photographs I make at the residency.</p>
<p>For $5, you will have with my gratitude.</p>
<p>For $10, I will mail a postcard sized photograph of my work thanking you for your support.</p>
<p>For $25, I will mail a hand written thank you letter with a series of three postcard-sized photographs of my work.</p>
<p>For $50, I will mail a handwritten thank you letter, a series of seven postcard-sized photographs of my work.</p>
<p>For $75, I will mail a handwritten thank you letter, a series of five postcard-sized photographs of my work and (1) 8”x10” signed print.</p>
<p>For $100, I will mail a handwritten thank you letter, a series of five postcard-sized photographs of my work and (2) 8”x10” signed prints of my work.</p>

<p>For $1,000, I will mail a handwritten thank you letter, a series of seven postcard-sized photographs of my work and (2) 8”x10”, (2) 11”x14”, (2) 16”x20” signed limited edition prints of my work.</p>
<p>For $2,000, I will mail a handwritten thank you letter, a series of 15 postcard-sized photographs of my work and (4) 8”x10”, (4) 11”x14”, (5) 16x20 signed limited edition prints of my work. I will also drive up to 200 miles to meet you in person to tell you how much I appreciate your support and answer any questions you have about my art.</p>
<p>Gifts will be sent out in December. Your support will allow me to take advantage of this opportunity and follow my dreams. I am familiar with taking risks for my art. In 2015, I traveled over 2 months exploring national parks and other monuments, photographing my surroundings with my large format camera, similar to photographers in the 19th century. It was such a transformative experience and I know this could be as well. Viewing the American landscape through the ground glass of my large format camera gives me a sense of purpose. I know my art can make a difference and influence others to take more interest in the state of our planet. Please help me in my goal to do so.</p>
<p>I know donating is not possible for everyone, however just sharing my campaign on Facebook or other media sites would make the world of difference for me! With your support, we can do it. You can view my past work at laura-cobb.com</p>

<h3>Why Don't You Smile More?</h3>
<p>It's a question everyone who experiences depression has probably heard at some point in their lives. We've come a long way in how we treat mental health issues, however either through ignorance or naivety, these hurtful questions can still be asked from time to time.</p>
<p>This is what this project wishes to address. We recruited some models, and told them that they have to smile for five minutes in a darkened room. The results are the images that you see in this series.</p>
<p>With your backing, we will be able to cover the material costs of putting on an exhibition, such as the mounting and printing of the photos, and we appreciate any pennies that we can get. </p>
<p>The focus of this project is education. We hope to encourage those who live or work with people with mental health to think about the impact of what they say, and to think of more constructive conversations that they can have.</p>
<h3><strong>What Your Money Goes Towards</strong></h3>
<p>Your donations will go towards the printing costs and cost of hardware necessary for the exhibition. This includes the price of printing fine art prints, a projector for the video installation, and the cost of entertainment and additional costs of the opening night. <strong>All money received past our target will be passed onto My Discombobulated Brain as a charitable donation. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Who Are My Discombobulated Brain?</strong></p>
<p>My Discombobulated Brain are a Cardiff-based charity, who aim to tackle the stigma associated with mental health head on, whilst offering a source of support and education to those who are affected by these issues.</p>
<p>Their aims are :</p>
<ul>
<li>To support young people, their friends and families in their mental health conversation; to help them learn how to speak about how they feel and to provide tools to recognise and approach the topic of mental health</li>
<li>To raise awareness about mental health issues, and to help society overcome the stigma attached to mental health</li>
<li>To provide insight and GUIDANCE to public and private organisations on their approach to mental health</li>
<li>To work with like minded people, charities and businesses to achieve these goals.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>My name is Karolina Gembara, I am a photographer, researcher and an educator. </p>
<p>I want to introduce you to my photobook which I am planning to publish this year together with <a href=""https://gostbooks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GOST Books</a>. This work is a result of my decade long difficult relationship with Delhi. </p>
<p>In 2009 I went to India to learn photography and stayed there for a long time. It was a fascinating journey and I gained a lot of experience but at the same time I felt homesick. At times it was very challenging. My relationship with Delhi was simply one of love and hate. </p>
<p>I never felt comfortable taking pictures on the street. So I needed to find a visual language - a language that would reflect my abilities but prevent me from simply being an onlooker. I turned to my friends, people I could identify myself with, with whom I could talk. With them I looked for quiet, isolated moments. These moments we shared were precious as the city doesn't offer much peace. </p>
<p>I moved around a lot, and found it hard to establish a home, a place I would feel comfortable in. Many people I met shared the same feelings. Our houses were temporary and even our romantic relationships were somehow superficial. The word that could describe that state of mind and life was “makeshift”.</p>
<p>The pictures I took during those years speak about that craving for comfort in the big city, and the loneliness that accompanied us every day. They also reveal my own need for a home and an attempt to create one. </p>

7milamiglialontano è un viaggio unico, suddiviso in sette tappe
diverse per itinerario, partecipanti, tempi e luoghi, ma riunite in un unico
intento, un unico scopo: ritrarre l'umanità.

L'idea di questo progetto è di Giuliano Radici, fotografo che da
anni organizza sfide nel mondo per dare un aiuto concreto ed originale ad
associazioni che sposano cause sociali.
Questo tour supporterà infatti 7 diverse associazioni, una per
ogni tappa: Emergency, Cesvi, Centro aiuti per l'Etiopia, Amici della Zizzi,
Fondazione Ant, Casa delle donne, Coopi
50 professionisti (fotografi,
giornalisti, videomaker) hanno creduto nell'idea e deciso di mettere passione,
tempo e impegno per metterla in pratica.


Lo scopo è fornire una mappa unica ed originale dell'umanità
concentrandosi in particolare sulle abitudini alimentari dei vari paesi. Alla
fine del viaggio verrà realizzato un cofanetto con libro e dvd dove sarà
possibile, attraverso immagini e i testi, vedere tutto il mondo.
 “Un viaggio di mille miglia comincia sempre con il primo passo”
Lao Tze
 Il viaggio è iniziato a giugno e le prime due tappe sono già
andate a buon fine.
Italia – Kazakisthan – team under 25




Kazakisthan-Cina 





Alaska - Panama
Le macchine sono ora arrivate in Alaska e il nostro terzo team
sta percorrendo la terza tappa


Potete seguire il viaggio leggendo gli articoli e guardando foto
e video sul Facebook 7mml



Sud Africa-Etiopia Etiopia-Milano, due tappe che hanno bisogno
di supporto 




“Ciò che non hai mai visto lo trovi dove non sei mai stato”
(Detto Africano)
Grazie alla fiducia dei nostri sponsor e all'aiuto di diverse
persone siamo riusciti a programmare la maggior parte delle tappe ma le ultime
due hanno bisogno del vostro aiuto.
Il viaggio arriverà comunque a Milano, la campagna infatti è
Flexible Founding (comunque avrete quello che prenotate) ma sarebbe bello avere
a bordo con noi abbastanza persone per completare sereni il progetto.
Dall'esperienza accumulata in altri viaggi stimiamo che le due
tappe africane costeranno 16000 euro (solo dogane, permessi, diesel).
Riceverai sicuramente quello che prenoti
Per venire incontro alle esigenze di tutti offriamo pacchetti
con diverse cifre. Ci teniamo a sottolineare che anche se non raggiungiamo i
16000 euro comunque il viaggio verrà completato e comunque riceverai quello che
hai prenotato che sia una cartolina dall'Africa o il cofanetto completo.

7milamiglialontano (7 thousand miles
afar) is one journey, consisting of seven stages which differ in itinerary,
duration and places, but are united in one single intent, one objective: to
portray humanity.



The inspiration for this project
came to Giuliano Radici, a photographer who has been organizing challenging
undertakings worldwide, to provide tangible and original help to associations
who support social campaigns.

This tour will, in fact, support 7
different associations, one for each stage: Emergency, Cesvi,
Centro aiuti per l'Etiopia, Amici della Zizzi, Fondazione Ant, Casa delle
donne, Coopi 
50 professionals (photographers,
journalists, video-makers), believe in this project and have devoted passion,
time and efforts to make it a reality.
The objective is to present a unique
and original map of humanity, focusing in particular on the eating habits of
various nations. At the end of the journey, we will prepare a casket containing
a book and a DVD where, through images and texts, one can see the whole world.
“The thousand-mile journey always begins with the first step” Lao Tze
The journey started last June and
the first two stages have been successfully completed.
 
Italy –
Kazakhstan (under-25 team)
Kazakhstan - China
Alaska - Panama


 
Our vehicles
have now arrived in Alaska and the third team is travelling along the third
stage.

South Africa-Ethiopia and Ethiopia-Milan, two
stages in need of support
“What you’ve never seen, is found where you’ve
never been” (African saying)
Thanks to our sponsors’ commitment,
and the help of several people, we’ve been able to plan most stages, but the
last two trips need your help.
The journey will end in Milan
anyway, in fact the campaign is Flexible Funding (you always get what you book)
but it would be nice to have enough people on board to complete the project
with ease.
Drawing from the experience gained
in other journeys, we expect the two African travels to cost 16.000€ (just for
customs, permits and fuel).
You will surely receive what you have booked
 
To
accommodate everyone’s needs, we offer packages at different prices. We want to
point out that, whether we collect 16.000€ or not, the journey will be
completed and you will receive what you have reserved, be it a postcard from
Africa or a whole casket.

<h3><b>GLORY DAYS - a high gloss magazine picture book</b></h3>
<p>Two years ago I startet concepting with graphic designer Paul Bowler. Editing followed just one rule: Every page should be a new confronting, confusing view. Out of every juxtaposition results an unexpected association, and we avoided repetition of motifs or even colour schemes. So it was clear to us that it should be a pure and simple book, much like a children's picture book. The only suspension are some black pages, where the index is hidden. We decided to show the pictures all over the pages, right from the first to the last. We wanted it to look like a magazine, so paper and cover have a high gloss shimmer. For the double page it is important to open the book easily, so it comes with American binding.<br/></p>

<p>Eduardo y Gabriela, Colombianos, de la ciudad de Bucaramanga. Soñadores insistidos, apasionados por la diversidad de culturas y naturaleza que hay en nuestro entorno, perseverantes y enamorados de la fotografía, así como mutuamente. Hace poco menos de dos años empezamos a hacer una serie de recorridos en nuestro país, a bordo de La Diabla, nuestra motocicleta, con la intención de conocer más profundamente y retratar las distintas idiosincrasias de nuestro país. En uno de estos viajes pensamos lo provechoso que sería para ampliar nuestros objetivos, dejar todo a un lado y conocer algunos rincones del continente. Desde ese momento la proyección de nuestro viaje se extendía cada vez más. Ya con un proyecto fotográfico en mente y pensando inicialmente en llegar hasta Perú, decidimos extender nuestro propósito y llegar a todos los rincones del continente. Comenzamos a trabajar, reducir gastos, vendimos accesorios, ropa y comida, buscamos cualquier ingreso para salir a nuestra aventura en la fecha propuesta: 18 de Noviembre de 2017; y así fue – aunque con un día de retraso. Ansiosos, llenos de expectativas y con una sonrisa que nada nos quitaba, empezamos con La Ruta de Fuego.</p>

<p><i>We are Eduardo and Gabriela, two Colombians from the city of Bucaramanga. Passionate<br/>dreamers and passionate about the difference and diversity of cultures and nature that<br/>surround us, we love photography as much as we love each other. Less than 2 years ago we<br/>started to travel around Colombia in our motorcycle, La Diabla), wanting to gain a deep<br/>knowledge of the country’s idiosyncrasies. In one of those trips we thought that it will be<br/>fruitful to amplify our objective, leave everything behind and travel around our continent.<br/>Since that moment the idea of such journey got stuck in our minds. At first, we planned to<br/>drive South and get to Peru, and then, we decided to make even bigger, it was to reach all<br/>the corners of the continent. We started by getting jobs to save as much as we could, we<br/>sold food, clothes and accessories. Tried everything we could to have everything we<br/>needed to start our adventure in the planned date: november 18th of 2017; we did it- but on<br/>the next day. Anxious, full of expectations and with a huge smile in our faces, we started<br/>with &amp;#39;La Ruta de Fuego&amp;#39; (The Route of Fire).</i></p>

<h3>NUESTRO PROYECTO / <i>OUR PROJECT</i>
</h3>
<p>LOS COLORES DEL SUR, en concreto, propone reunir fotografías de la belleza que nos encontramos en esta ruta, desarrollada a lo largo de todos los países Sur Americanos (exceptuando, lastimosamente, Venezuela por la situación actual del país) para mostrar con orgullo lo que somos, lo que nos diferencia y principalmente, lo que nos acerca, dejando a un lado cualquier debate social y político que se nos ha grabado de manera inconsciente. Y así, demostrar que las fronteras que nos dividen no son estructuras que separan, sino barreras mentales que nos distancian y debilitan.</p>
<p>El concepto de 'Los Colores del Sur' es un espacio en el que confluirá la representación de Sur América: su biodiversidad en paisajes, gente, agricultura y animales, de la mano con la armonía de los colores que cada espacio representa. De esta forma serán distribuidas las imágenes, por las paletas de colores y la sensación que genera cada espectro de color al verlo. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p><i>The main purpose of &amp;#39;Colors of the South&amp;#39;, is to gather photographs of the beauty that<br/>surrounds our route across South America on a Book (unfortunately omitting Venezuela<br/>due its current situation) to show with pride what we are as South Americans, our<br/>differences and especially, what unite us, leaving aside any social or political difference,<br/>that might be unconsciously embedded in our minds. And in that way show that the borders<br/>that divided us are not solid structures that can separate us, but just a mental just mental<br/>construction.<br/>The concept of &amp;#39;The Colors of the South&amp;#39; is to have a space to show all that represents South<br/>America: biodiversity in its landscapes, the people, agriculture and animals, and the<br/>sensations that they cause on us. All distributed by a color harmony for each place.</i></p>

<p>Nuestra forma de solventar el viaje económicamente ha ido de la mano de la gente que nos permite entrar a su cotidianidad, abriéndonos las puertas para llevar a cabo nuestro trabajo de ventas (fotografías postales, comidas, entre otros) y los ahorros que reunimos antes de emprender el viaje. Ahora, después de 210 días de viaje, 13.000 km marcados por el tacómetro de nuestra moto y una serie de pérdidas inesperadas (pantalla del computador partida, un accidente en carretera, que no nos afectó a nosotros pero nos obligó sacar nuestro presupuesto para los arreglos de la motocicleta, y pequeños inconvenientes mecánicos) nos vemos en la necesidad de un apoyo que permita cumplir con la etapa de desarrollo de ‘LOS COLORES DEL SUR’.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><i>We are living on the help that people is offering by opening their doors for us so we can do our<br/>sales (post cards and food) and with the savings that we had before starting the trip. Now, after 210 days, with 13000 km on the odometer of our motorcycle, and some unexpected losses (as a broken pc screen, and an accident, that didn&amp;#39;t affect our wellbeing, but it made us spend our emergency cash to fix the motorcycle, and work on some mechanical issues).<br/>So we are on the need to ask for some support that will help us fullfill with &amp;#39;The Colors of the South</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529165426/uog686bdrdvfpwypj0js.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><b>¿POR QUÉ INDIEGOGO? / <i>Why INDIEGOGO?</i></b></p>
<p>Seguros de que la cifra buscada en indiegogo no es para solventar el total de nuestros gastos, ya que continuaremos trabajando a lo largo de la ruta, acudimos a este medio por dos razones: la primera, queremos conseguir un lente gran angular (Lente Sigma 10-20mm F4-5.6) que tiene valor aproximado de $500 USD porque nos hemos encontrado en la necesidad de ampliar la vista a tantas cosas por capturar y a veces no es suficiente el equipo con el que contamos, y aunque es nuestra meta lograr la realización de ‘LOS COLORES DEL SUR’ con equipo promedio, adquirir este lente nos permitiría aumentar la calidad de nuestras imágenes, aprovechando así el impactante espacio que nos rodea; y la segunda, a lo largo de nuestro viaje por Bolivia tuvimos una serie de problemas mecánicos y el accidente mencionado anteriormente, que implicaron un gasto acelerado del ahorro de que teníamos. Ahora, entrando a los países con la gasolina más costosa (Brasil, Argentina, Uruguay y Chile) buscamos tener un respaldo.</p>
<p>De acuerdo a nuestra experiencia durante estos 7 meses y teniendo claro la forma en la que gastamos el dinero, concluimos que el mayor, y casi único gasto económico presentado es la gasolina, su precio en los diferentes países de Latinoamérica es muy irregular. Por galón (4 litros) desde $1,50 USD en Ecuador, hasta $6 USD en Brasil. Calculamos para la finalización de nuestro viaje, de acuerdo a que los precios se mantienen en línea aproximadamente, ($6 USD x galón) en los países restantes, un total aproximado de 20.000 km gastaría 73 tanques llenos, y da un total de $1.200 USD.</p>
<p>En ese órden de ideas, la forma en la que distribuiremos el dinero será entre adquirir el lente como prioridad y lo restante será nuestra reserva de gasolina. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529127287/fad0dpgyutqffbvcenya.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>We are sure that the money we get in indiegogo isn’t for solving all our needs, and we’ll<br/>continue working along the route. We came to this page for two reasons: first, we want to<br/>get a wide aperture lens a Sigma 10-20mm F4-5.6 that has a value of approximately.<br/>$500 USD. We feel in the need of making our view bigger, there’s so much things to show<br/>and sometimes our kit is not good enough to make it, although we want to make ‘The<br/>Colors of the South’ with basic equipment, getting this lens will make our quality higher.<br/>The second reason is because while we were in Bolivia we got some mechanical issues and<br/>the accident we already mentioned, which forced us to spend our money. And now, we will<br/>be riding into countries where the gas is the most expensive (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay<br/>and Chile) we look for a support.</i></p>
<p><br/><i>Based in our experience along this 7 months and knowing the way we spend money, we are<br/>sure that our higher cost is the gas, it’s value in South America is very irregular. One<br/>gallon (4 liters) can go from $1,50 USD in Ecuador, to $6 USD in Brazil. We calculate for<br/>our travel’s financing, considering that the value keeps almost the same that in Brazil: with<br/>a approximate of 20.000 km for73 gallons. It will have a cost of $1.200 USD total.</i></p>
<p><br/><i>Therefore, the way we use your donations will be, first, to buy the lens, and the rest for gas<br/>money.</i></p>

<h3>NUESTROS RETOS / <i>OUR CHALLENGES</i>
</h3>
<p>En la medida que avanzábamos más y más fuera de nuestra zona de confort encontramos todo tipo de cambios, el primero y más notorio las carreteras que hemos recorrido hasta el momento las cuales han representaron un gran reto, al enfrentarnos a todo tipo de terrenos, desde las amplias vías ecuatorianas, pasando por el inclemente desierto peruano hasta alcanzar mayores alturas rodeadas de nevados sometidos a granizo o lluvia, a pistas destapadas de un solo carril poniendo a prueba nuestra pericia para no dejar nada al azar, aprendiendo así a conocer la resistencia y alcances de nuestra fortaleza mental y física, recibiendo como mayor recompensa estar rodeados de los mejores paisajes, los mismos que hacen impensable la idea de dar marcha a atrás y así continuar capturando y acumulando en nuestro archivo las gamas de colores q se nos presentan</p>
<p>Aún más significativo ha sido para nosotros el reto de aprender a desenvolvernos entre las diferentes culturas, ya que si bien con la mayoría de pueblos compartimos el mismo lenguaje, en otros casos no, como el caso del altiplano peruano y boliviano donde muchos hablan quechua, hasta nuestra actual ubicación en Brasil donde se habla el portugués, y como no solamente nos interesa el simple acto de transitar por un lugar, si no de compartir de manera ávida un contexto social diferente que nos permita retratar adecuadamente las maneras en que una persona o una comunidad se desenvuelve, nos sobran las ganas de aprender el idioma para comunicarnos debidamente, como adecuar nuestra forma para relacionarnos de mejor manera, permitiéndonos entablar una estrecha relación que nos permite plasmar de manera más cercana la realidad de lo que nuestros sentidos perciben.</p>
<p>Consideramos como un desafío para la ejecución de nuestro proyecto la clase de equipos con los que contamos, ya que hay momentos en los que se hace necesario un lente de mayor amplitud y luminosidad que permita aprovechar de mejor manera entornos de poca luz y de poco espacio focal.</p>
<p>Equipos con los que contamos:</p>
<p>Cámara canon EOS T3, Lente 50 mm F 1.8, Lente zoom EFS 55 – 250 mm 1:4 – 5.6, Lente zoom EFS 18 – 55 mm 1:3.5 – 5.6, Cámara Gopro Hero 4</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529170597/mucno6a1fjwulrqaa5cs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>At the time that we go far away from our comfort zone, find all kind of changes, the first<br/>and notorious are the roads that we go that have represent a big challenge. Starting with<br/>the huge Ecuadorian highways, then the ruthless desert in Peru that guided us to the top of<br/>snowy peaks, riding on hailstorms and hard rain. We also got into one-way unpaved roads,<br/>all this make us prove our physic and mental resistance, getting the reward of enjoying the<br/>best landscapes, the ones that made us think of the impossibility of going quitting. This way<br/>we will attain all the color spectrum that passes in front of us.</i></p>
<p><br/><i>The most meaningful thing for us has been the challenge of learning to delve into the<br/>different cultures. On mostly of which our language is spoken, but in other places in Peru,<br/>Bolivia they speak Quechua, the traditional Inca language, and Portuguese in Brazil. We<br/>do not want just to get in and out of the places that we visit, but to explore in to the context<br/>so we can truly capture the things that we get to discover.</i></p>
<p><i>Our photography kit: Camera CANON EOS T3, 50mm F1.8 Lens, 55 – 250mm 1:4 – 5.6 Zoom Lens EFS, 18-55mm 1:3.5 – 5.6 Zoom EFS Lens, Camera Gopro Hero 4.</i></p>

The main purpose of &#39;Colors of the South&#39;, is to gather photographs of the beauty thatsurrounds our route across South America on a Book (unfortunately omitting Venezueladue its current situation) to show with pride what we are as South Americans, ourdifferences and especially, what unite us, leaving aside any social or political difference,that might be unconsciously embedded in our minds. And in that way show that the bordersthat divided us are not solid structures that can separate us, but just a mental just mentalconstruction.The concept of &#39;The Colors of the South&#39; is to have a space to show all that represents SouthAmerica: biodiversity in its landscapes, the people, agriculture and animals, and thesensations that they cause on us. All distributed by a color harmony for each place.

Nuestra forma de solventar el viaje económicamente ha ido de la mano de la gente que nos permite entrar a su cotidianidad, abriéndonos las puertas para llevar a cabo nuestro trabajo de ventas (fotografías postales, comidas, entre otros) y los ahorros que reunimos antes de emprender el viaje. Ahora, después de 210 días de viaje, 13.000 km marcados por el tacómetro de nuestra moto y una serie de pérdidas inesperadas (pantalla del computador partida, un accidente en carretera, que no nos afectó a nosotros pero nos obligó sacar nuestro presupuesto para los arreglos de la motocicleta, y pequeños inconvenientes mecánicos) nos vemos en la necesidad de un apoyo que permita cumplir con la etapa de desarrollo de ‘LOS COLORES DEL SUR’.

We are living on the help that people is offering by opening their doors for us so we can do oursales (post cards and food) and with the savings that we had before starting the trip. Now, after 210 days, with 13000 km on the odometer of our motorcycle, and some unexpected losses (as a broken pc screen, and an accident, that didn&#39;t affect our wellbeing, but it made us spend our emergency cash to fix the motorcycle, and work on some mechanical issues).So we are on the need to ask for some support that will help us fullfill with &#39;The Colors of the South

¿POR QUÉ INDIEGOGO? / Why INDIEGOGO?
Seguros de que la cifra buscada en indiegogo no es para solventar el total de nuestros gastos, ya que continuaremos trabajando a lo largo de la ruta, acudimos a este medio por dos razones: la primera, queremos conseguir un lente gran angular (Lente Sigma 10-20mm F4-5.6) que tiene valor aproximado de $500 USD porque nos hemos encontrado en la necesidad de ampliar la vista a tantas cosas por capturar y a veces no es suficiente el equipo con el que contamos, y aunque es nuestra meta lograr la realización de ‘LOS COLORES DEL SUR’ con equipo promedio, adquirir este lente nos permitiría aumentar la calidad de nuestras imágenes, aprovechando así el impactante espacio que nos rodea; y la segunda, a lo largo de nuestro viaje por Bolivia tuvimos una serie de problemas mecánicos y el accidente mencionado anteriormente, que implicaron un gasto acelerado del ahorro de que teníamos. Ahora, entrando a los países con la gasolina más costosa (Brasil, Argentina, Uruguay y Chile) buscamos tener un respaldo.
De acuerdo a nuestra experiencia durante estos 7 meses y teniendo claro la forma en la que gastamos el dinero, concluimos que el mayor, y casi único gasto económico presentado es la gasolina, su precio en los diferentes países de Latinoamérica es muy irregular. Por galón (4 litros) desde $1,50 USD en Ecuador, hasta $6 USD en Brasil. Calculamos para la finalización de nuestro viaje, de acuerdo a que los precios se mantienen en línea aproximadamente, ($6 USD x galón) en los países restantes, un total aproximado de 20.000 km gastaría 73 tanques llenos, y da un total de $1.200 USD.
En ese órden de ideas, la forma en la que distribuiremos el dinero será entre adquirir el lente como prioridad y lo restante será nuestra reserva de gasolina. 

We are sure that the money we get in indiegogo isn’t for solving all our needs, and we’llcontinue working along the route. We came to this page for two reasons: first, we want toget a wide aperture lens a Sigma 10-20mm F4-5.6 that has a value of approximately.$500 USD. We feel in the need of making our view bigger, there’s so much things to showand sometimes our kit is not good enough to make it, although we want to make ‘TheColors of the South’ with basic equipment, getting this lens will make our quality higher.The second reason is because while we were in Bolivia we got some mechanical issues andthe accident we already mentioned, which forced us to spend our money. And now, we willbe riding into countries where the gas is the most expensive (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguayand Chile) we look for a support.
Based in our experience along this 7 months and knowing the way we spend money, we aresure that our higher cost is the gas, it’s value in South America is very irregular. Onegallon (4 liters) can go from $1,50 USD in Ecuador, to $6 USD in Brazil. We calculate forour travel’s financing, considering that the value keeps almost the same that in Brazil: witha approximate of 20.000 km for73 gallons. It will have a cost of $1.200 USD total.
Therefore, the way we use your donations will be, first, to buy the lens, and the rest for gasmoney.

NUESTROS RETOS / OUR CHALLENGES

En la medida que avanzábamos más y más fuera de nuestra zona de confort encontramos todo tipo de cambios, el primero y más notorio las carreteras que hemos recorrido hasta el momento las cuales han representaron un gran reto, al enfrentarnos a todo tipo de terrenos, desde las amplias vías ecuatorianas, pasando por el inclemente desierto peruano hasta alcanzar mayores alturas rodeadas de nevados sometidos a granizo o lluvia, a pistas destapadas de un solo carril poniendo a prueba nuestra pericia para no dejar nada al azar, aprendiendo así a conocer la resistencia y alcances de nuestra fortaleza mental y física, recibiendo como mayor recompensa estar rodeados de los mejores paisajes, los mismos que hacen impensable la idea de dar marcha a atrás y así continuar capturando y acumulando en nuestro archivo las gamas de colores q se nos presentan
Aún más significativo ha sido para nosotros el reto de aprender a desenvolvernos entre las diferentes culturas, ya que si bien con la mayoría de pueblos compartimos el mismo lenguaje, en otros casos no, como el caso del altiplano peruano y boliviano donde muchos hablan quechua, hasta nuestra actual ubicación en Brasil donde se habla el portugués, y como no solamente nos interesa el simple acto de transitar por un lugar, si no de compartir de manera ávida un contexto social diferente que nos permita retratar adecuadamente las maneras en que una persona o una comunidad se desenvuelve, nos sobran las ganas de aprender el idioma para comunicarnos debidamente, como adecuar nuestra forma para relacionarnos de mejor manera, permitiéndonos entablar una estrecha relación que nos permite plasmar de manera más cercana la realidad de lo que nuestros sentidos perciben.
Consideramos como un desafío para la ejecución de nuestro proyecto la clase de equipos con los que contamos, ya que hay momentos en los que se hace necesario un lente de mayor amplitud y luminosidad que permita aprovechar de mejor manera entornos de poca luz y de poco espacio focal.
Equipos con los que contamos:
Cámara canon EOS T3, Lente 50 mm F 1.8, Lente zoom EFS 55 – 250 mm 1:4 – 5.6, Lente zoom EFS 18 – 55 mm 1:3.5 – 5.6, Cámara Gopro Hero 4

At the time that we go far away from our comfort zone, find all kind of changes, the firstand notorious are the roads that we go that have represent a big challenge. Starting withthe huge Ecuadorian highways, then the ruthless desert in Peru that guided us to the top ofsnowy peaks, riding on hailstorms and hard rain. We also got into one-way unpaved roads,all this make us prove our physic and mental resistance, getting the reward of enjoying thebest landscapes, the ones that made us think of the impossibility of going quitting. This waywe will attain all the color spectrum that passes in front of us.
The most meaningful thing for us has been the challenge of learning to delve into thedifferent cultures. On mostly of which our language is spoken, but in other places in Peru,Bolivia they speak Quechua, the traditional Inca language, and Portuguese in Brazil. Wedo not want just to get in and out of the places that we visit, but to explore in to the contextso we can truly capture the things that we get to discover.
Our photography kit: Camera CANON EOS T3, 50mm F1.8 Lens, 55 – 250mm 1:4 – 5.6 Zoom Lens EFS, 18-55mm 1:3.5 – 5.6 Zoom EFS Lens, Camera Gopro Hero 4.

<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p>Hella Positive Pin Up specializes in radically inclusive sexiness. We're crowd-funded so we can shoot for free, allowing anyone who wants to feel sexy and share their story to participate. We've been going full time for two years now, well over 100 sets shot and shared with our backers, and stories and images shared with the entire world. We've had people from all walks of life, different backgrounds and ethnicities and ages and sizes and genders and orientations, all showing off what makes them feel sexy in the hopes that more and more we can all learn to accept ourselves as beautiful. We don't need what conventional media tells us is hot.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This last year has been our best year yet, but we've also encountered a few hurdles recently. In October we purchased a fancy new camera and a professional battery powered lighting kit, spending about $6k that we had managed to squirrel away on side gigs. But the time has come to replace the laptop that we've been doing all our editing and retouching on as we spend 6+ months of the year on the road, as well as new hard drives to keep everything securely backed up, new memory cards, and a few other bits and bobs needed to keep everything running smoothly. All told, we just put $4000 on credit cards in the name of a more efficient and less stressful operation. It's not a huge sum of money, but it's enough for a company that operates on a shoestring budget. We're hoping to pay off that debt sooner rather than later, and that's where you come in.</p>
<p>We aren't asking for a hand out we don't need. We're lucky enough that we can afford to pay this bill if we have to. But it is a burden on a small company, and if we can get it paid of sooner we're more than happy to give you some sweet swag in exchange.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Let's get transparent on the numbers here. HPP makes give or take $2200 a month from our backers. That money pays for travel expenses, website hosting and other services, and the living expenses of our owner (me, why did I write all this up to now in the 3rd person?) It's my job, and as it stands I still need the occasional side gig to get by. I can pay of this debt, slowly, but it's a very real impact on my livelihood. Every dollar we raise is one less I have to pay off, with interest, to keep this project going.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have dollars to give, believe me I get it. There's a lot you can still do to help though. Sharing this campaign is huge. Sharing the blog (<a href=""http://hellapositivepinup.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://hellapositivepinup.com</a>) is huge, as the increased traffic will lead to more subscription pledges that will help keep the lights on for years to come.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This series is inspired by art from the middle ages as well as Pre-Raphaelite paintings set during that time. This series references real historical figures, iconography, and traditions of the times but is not based on 100% historical accuracy-it is my artistic interpretation.  </p>
<p>Here is a sample of a self portrait I shot in this vein in Paris, as a Joan of Arc figure, which gives you an idea what the work will look like:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546399867/q9hfiqrlinswkyecgxk1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This series combines my love of history with my appreciation of the subjects of the work who are all admirable individuals in their passions and vivid personalities. I want to with the images, empower them through them playing various characters of these times.</p>
<p>The intention is to create a body of work that will be turned into both an exhibition in Los Angeles, possibly also abroad, as well as a book that will be printed in limited edition.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
<p>I have already started to get things together-I have my roundtrip plane tickets, a few clothing items, and a 3 rolls of expired medium format Agfa film (and non-expired Portra as back-up).</p>
<p>The funds I raise will be going towards:</p>
<p><i>Pre-production and production</i></p>
<ul>
<li>the purchasing of<strong> early-late medieval era costumes</strong> for the shoot (for 10 subjects-includes ARMOUR, CHAINMAIL, CROWNS): $1,400 </li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is an inherent risk in making a passion project being shot in two foreign countries with a lot of moving pieces, which when complete I need to pitch to an art gallery to exhibit.</p>
<p>As an artist with a background since pursuing photography seriously in high school, with working 'guerilla style' and self financing my passion projects, I am used to finding solutions to challenges that I face when making this work, as well as knowing when to compromise. For example- if I do not raise the total I hope to raise I will certainly have to make compromises-whether it is having less images in the series or printing smaller for the exhibition. I am prepared to deal with these challenges if I end up facing them! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I’ve also been fascinated myself by knights and princes, but wished there was more representation in medieval art of those existing outside of the gender binary in positions of power or women in typically “masculine” roles in medieval art. For example, women are often delegated to the love interest of a strong heroic man and without regard to their own strength and individual personality. Those depicted as strong willed were often met with unfortunate ends (think of Mary Queen of Scots and Joan of Arc).</p>
<p>In the historical research I’ve already been doing, I’ve discovered there have been gay and lesbian stories was in the middle ages which were erased from the art of the times due to censorship-for example, the story of the “girl king”, queen Christina of Sweden who was involved in a relationship with another woman Ebba Sparre. This project will in using the visual language and settings of the past, shed light on the present with how society defines gender and gender roles.</p>

FOREWORDIn the late summer of 2016, I spent six weeks in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, making photos to document the transformation process of the most important cities in the region: Ordos, Hohhot, and Baotou. Surprisingly, these images recalled me the post second world war Italian film season that wished to raise awareness on the booming developments surrounding the historic cities of Italy.The shocking similarity between images made over 50 years away, testify to a dominant, globalized and normalized character of these settlement processes. There is a common denominator, which seems to cancel the geography and the temporal distance between the events told by my visual-journey. The gaze moves in silent and mysterious places that seem to push the viewer beyond the empirical evidence towards an almost dreamlike dimension. Or a ""post dream"" scenario.
THE BOOKDuring my journey in the Inner Mongolia region, I discovered that no matter the scale, the definition of habitat tends to be homologated. What I was experiencing, was the impact of the present geological era, the Anthropocene, where landscape, as well as earth system processes and dynamics, are altered by humans. The question posed by the project is if there is still space for another image of the city, beyond the apocalyptic dystopia laid ahead by the great metropolis of the twenty-first century.
It is no surprise the abrupt acceleration that urbanism has achieved at the beginning of the new millennium. The post-war urbanization responded to the need for real house policies in an increasingly industrial society that was huddled at the gates of ancient cities. What we observe in China, on the other hand, is a projection of needs not entirely expected, which foreshadow the construction of a priori housing complexes often empty. This is why the few people we see appear to us more like mannequins, or puppets of a show that got out of hand, victims like mythological shadows of a stage from whose destiny they are excluded. My wish is to stimulate to an historical thinking, in order not to be dazzled in the future by the easy clamor of an inexistent present, and therefore to position our gaze in a critical perspective as when photography becomes a project.

<h3>Photohive is my latest labor of love</h3>
<p>Photohive will be a student centered photographic non profit enabling students from across the country to propose solo exhibitions, participate in themed group exhibitions, curate a group student exhibition as well as lecture about their photography. </p>
<p>I've been teaching photography since 2007 after completing my MFA at Parsons in New York. I experienced first hand the challenge of finding my first exhibition outside the academic setting. I felt frustrated having to compete with emerging photographers/artists for the same few slots galleries, museums and non profits offered yearly. Now as a professor, I witness my students' frustrations in trying to find exhibitions and funding to help participate in their first exhibition.</p>
<p>Photohive will be dedicated to exhibiting high quality student work while financially suppoting students in their endeavors to produce, print and ship their artwork to our gallery space through awards and scholarships.<br/></p>
<p>Photohive will also offer semester long internships for college credit.</p>

<h3>Why San Antonio, Texas??</h3>
<p>San Antonio is the 7th largest city in America. I know shocking–yet we have no dedicated photography gallery space albeit profit or non profit. Additionally, San Antonio is home to Fotoseptiembre an annual festival showcasing international, national and local photography talent. Although the events are well attended we still lack a main gathering location to host and promote this event and all photography related exhibitions throughout the city.</p>
<p>Furthermore, San Antonio offers photography degrees and photo courses from institutions such as Trinity University, Incarnate Word University, UTSA, Southwest School of Art, SAC, Our Lady of the Lake, The Art Institute of San Antonio to name but a few. Texas State is 40 minutes away, UT Austin an hour and other smaller colleges near by which could all benefit from Photohive's existence.</p>
<p>Additionally Photohive could collaborate with the Austin Center for Photography which I co-founded in 2008 and the Houston Center for Photography on special events.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As most of you know, I love taking pictures. And, as it turns out, I’m pretty good at it. In fact, I’ve started building a base of clients who like my pictures enough to pay for them.</p>
<p>The more work I get, the more I learn about photography; and the more I learn, the more I know that I want to be a professional photographer.</p>
<p>A professional photographer needs a professional camera. I know it sounds simple, but there’s a little thing called “money” that’s been standing in the way of getting the camera I should be using.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m coming to you — my family and friends, people who know me and love me and want to see me succeed — to support me in making a career out of my passion.</p>
<h3>Exactly What I Need</h3>
<p>The camera I need is a Nikon D90 12-Megapixel Digital SLR Camera with 18-105mm DX VR Lens (see photo above), as well as certain essential accessories. Here is the complete list, along with their prices:</p>
<p>Camera body ($1,100)</p>
<p>Accessories:<br/>Nikon 55-200mm f/4 5.6G ED-IF AF-S Camera Lens w/ Vibration Reduction ($300)<br/>Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight Unit ($120)<br/>Spare Nikon EN-EL3E Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery ($45)<br/>Vidpro STU-25 Camera Bag ($20)<br/>Davis &amp; Sanford Vista Fusion Tripod (Black) ($35)<br/>SanDisk 8GB Ultra Secure Digital (SD) Memory Card ($14)<br/>Multi-Optical Cleaner Kit ($16)<br/>Adobe Photoshop Lightroom ($150)</p>
<p>This camera is lightweight and very user-friendly, with both manual and auto modes as well as HD video. I’ve worked with other cameras and this one just feels “right”.</p>
<h3>What You Get for Helping Me</h3>
<div>Aside from my deep gratitude, I will gladly offer a high-resolution photo that you can use to present yourself or promote your business!</div>
<p>If I don’t reach my entire goal, your contribution will still be put to good use: I'll purchase as much as I can with what I have, and will continue to work toward obtaining the rest.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>
<p>You might not have money to give, but here are some other ways you can help me reach my career goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please help me get the word out by sharing my campaign with your circle of friends. (Using the Indiegogo share tools makes it really easy!)</li>
<li>When I do get my camera, please keep me in mind for any projects for which you’ll need a photographer.</li>

The Impact
 Local German settlers want the Church restored for the high regard many German families have for the Black families who built and attended services in this old church. It should be known that many Fredericksburg German settlers did not believe in slavery and sided with the Union during the Civil War, There is also a sense of home that Black families feel for Fredericksburg, as seen in their efforts to restore the church. This church was one of their first assets, as a people, and it was a symbol of local racial tolerance and the American dream. Possibly, the greatest impact of this campaign is the realization of how far we have come as a community and as a nation since segregation persisted over so many years.
    Risks & Challenges The greatest challenge is securing the funds for the materials and professional services to ensure the church stands strong and open to others for the current and future generations.

<h3><strong>My Story: </strong></h3>
<p>I am a Spanish professor and photographer from San Diego, CA. I will be leading a month long photography workshop for youth at Casa Amarela (Yellow House) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. My vision for this 100cameras Snapshot Project is to see local youth learn photography and engage in creative expression as a means to grow both personally and professionally in the neighborhood of Morro da Providência, a favela in Rio. I have a deep passion for photography, teaching, and Brazilian culture. I have lived and worked in Brazil as a volunteer for extended periods of time, and I have also taught Spanish at the university level for over fifteen years. I have already spent time in the Providência neighborhood in Rio, and I recently had a photo exhibition showcasing these photos. I am hoping to give back to the community through the 100cameras project in order for the kids to grow creatively and personally.</p>

<h3><strong>The Project:</strong></h3>
<p>I was privileged to spend time in Rio de Janeiro with photographer and human rights activist Maurício Hora (when I did a workshop with Magnum photographer David Alan Harvey during the spring of 2014). While I was at Morro da Providência, I was impressed by Maurício Hora and the way he connected with and cared for the kids at Casa Amarela (a community center for youth donated by the French artist JR in 2009). In 2008, JR did a project in Providência called Women are Heroes (to celebrate the women in the neighborhood and also raise awareness about the demolition of houses and people being removed from their homes). In a gesture to help the community and specifically youth through art projects and educational activities, JR founded Casa Amarela for local kids to have a place to take interactive art classes, read books in a library, and also act as an activity center. I especially like how the community focus at Casa Amarela is specifically for the youth of the neighborhood, and this has been its purpose since it was started. I will come alongside both 100cameras and CoFondation (JR’s non-profit) in a collaboration to lead a workshop in Morro da Providência in which the kids in the neighborhood can learn about photography and visual storytelling, and also give back to their own community. Since I have experience with photography, teaching, and I also speak fluent Portuguese, I feel that I have some of the foundational elements to help create a meaningful project. I look forward to organizing, teaching classes, and offering a celebration of art and wholeheartedly dignifying the children and their potential during this project. This Snapshot project has the potential to have a profound effect on the kids’ lives and futures.</p>
<p>While I personally have covered many of the costs for this project, I still need your help! Would you consider donating to this wonderful cause? I am a volunteer, the people who lead both 100cameras and CoFondation volunteer their time for the projects they do. Your donation and support will help the kids at Casa Amarela have an amazing, life-changing experience! Please consider helping and sharing this cause with others!</p>
<h3><strong>100cameras:</strong></h3>
<p>100cameras is a non-profit organization based in New York City, and has successfully completed photography projects with youth around the world.

As the Snapshot Project Leader for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, I will live, breathe, and thrive in facilitating a project in a community that I am passionate about and am committed to. The proceeds raised from the kids’ photos in Rio will go directly back to Morro da Providência and Casa Amarela educational projects in the future. This is a win-win combination, for sure!

<h3>Hey, I'm Lucia and this is my story.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Today our nature is in danger, and climate change is dangerously threatening the most cold regions of the planet. When you see the Arctic on TV, its frozen seas and vast expanses of ice and snow look like they belong on another planet. But the damage climate change is causing to the region could have catastrophic consequences much closer to home.</p>
<ul>
<li>&gt;10% - rate at which summer sea ice is disappearing per decade, threatening species like polar bears</li>
<li>¼ - estimated proportion of the world’s untapped oil and gas reserves found in the Arctic. As the ice moves out, oil companies are moving in.</li>
<li>25,000 – polar bears in the wild today</li>
</ul>
<p>As a Landscape Photographer and nature-lover I cannot stay in my Southern European comfort zone and watch our world disappear little by little. This is why I have decided to travel to the western most land of Europe, to Tasiilaq in the south-east of Greenland adventure.</p>
<p>This summer, 2017, I’ll leave for this solo at 37 years old I'm taking a risk to step out of everyday life, while I follow this dream and accomplish something both scary and exciting. My goal is for this expedition to spread awareness, a message of hope, and ultimately to sensitise people to take positive actions for themselves and for our planet - and to understand that they might be one and the same.</p>

We are supporting SOS Children's Villages, Leh and Dharamsala, to care for and educate Tibetan Refugee Orphans.</strong></em></p>
<p align=""center"">Here's a brief on the project from my orientaleye.co.uk website</p>
<p align=""center"">'This summer ,2013, I will be returning to Ladakh, high in the Himalayan Mountains, near to Tibet, for two months, with a special project in mind.<br/> I will be travelling for 10 weeks with my photographer friend 'daffy', by motorcycle (50's classic Enfields) and Horseback, trekking too, through some of the most awe-inspiring landscapes on this beautiful planet. <br/> We will produce a boook which not only contains beautiful images and written word too, but will also illustrate our efforts, choices and decisions in the process of the adventure. Some of the images will, unusually, portray the photographer at work, with an explanation of all that was involved to make the shot - the DNA of the shot if you like. Also included will be the 'exif info' the camera and lens settings, which may help developing photographers (pun intended!) to understand the effects of different technical choices.<br/> It won't be a technical manual, nothing like it, but I do think that some understanding of the whole story of the shots enables one to connect with and to 'feel' the shots a little more.<br/> Funds raised through the project will help to support Tibetan Refugee Orphans'</p>
<p>Who are we?</p>
<p> Dave Davies, builder, photographer &amp; student of philosophy &amp; psychology at The Open University, UK</p>

<p>Irwin ‘Daffy’ Smith, builder, photographer, musician.</p>
<h3 align=""center""><em>‘’The call of the wild; that wondering of what lies beyond the horizon, that inner voice urging to venture where few others will go…listen…’’</em></h3>
<p>Often-times our own sense of presence in this life is subdued…dormant almost, but there are places on this Earth that somehow, through sheer majestic beauty, bring forth a feeling of overwhelming wonder and amazement – and a deep sense of connection. Our hope is to capture this feeling by venturing high into the challenging and magnificent landscape of Ladakh, and to share the experience through photography and words. We are particularly interested in the idea of introducing the work of the photographer to you, the adventure of the project, the choices and decisions we make and to experiment with incorporating this into some of the shots, hopefully it'll make the work more enjoyable, more accessible and perhaps a little instructive too.</p>
<p>High in the Himalayas, in the far north of India, Ladakh is one of Earth's most isolated and remote regions, culturally rooted more in Tibet than India. Over two months in summer 2013, we plan to explore this region by motorcycle, pony and on foot.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Bikers in Chandra River Valley, Ladakh"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/708050/pictures/full/20130316080221-Bikers_Chandra_River_Valley__Ladakh.jpg?1363446144"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: text-bottom;"" title=""The Awesome Manali-Leh Highway""/></p>
<p>There is a special urgency to the project - recently work has begun on the construction of a road tunnel through the Rohtang Pass, to open up access to the region, and the rail network is expanding northwards. The isolated uniqueness of the region may soon be diminished, and with it the opportunity for the adventurer to experience such a wilderness.</p>
<p align=""center""><em><strong>Rivers run deep, mountains climb high</strong></em></p>
<p>Join us as we travel by motorcycle along the challenging and awe-inspiring Manali-Leh highway…over dangerous Rohtang La, the “Pile of Dead Bodies Pass”...up into the high Himalayan mountains and valleys… traversing ancient trade routes and gorges on horseback and by foot... staying with local people in remote communities and camping out beneath expansive crystal skies. Via camera and journal we will be recording both the awe-inspiring and the intimate moments as we face the hazards and joys of high altitude, avalanches, hairpin bends and vertical drops, fast flowing melt-water floods, local beer and... who knows...? </p>
<p>Through your contribution and engagement with us on this project and through our regular photographic and written updates on our Facebook page we hope to transport you to the heart-place of our adventures as the on-going development of the project and book.

<h3>Who the hell is Ivana?</h3>
I'm a struggling artist and college student with all of the debt and mediocre credit that comes with it. I'm interested in art, traveling, pop culture, animals, and documenting these things through photography.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've studied photography in school for five years and have been taking pictures since I was old enough to hold a camera.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>What good will this do anyway?</h3>
<p>This campaign will help me raise the funds needed to fix my current photo equipment which has recently become unreliable and hard to use. If successful, the campaign will also enable me to buy upgraded equipment which will provide the tools needed for furthering my photographic skills. <br/><br/>New equipment would allow for: Higher resolution images and better lighting (great for sharper pictures and large prints!), high speed and continuous shooting (good for important events or hyper kids!), and so many more options for artistic expression and learning! </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
<div>Perks! Choose a donation level and get stuff in return, from my gratitude and e-mail updates to posters or even wedding packages! I don't expect you to help me without getting something in return, so look through the options on the right and find something that interests you.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For clarification, I'd like to note that photoshoots and wedding packages paid for through this Indiegogo campaign will actually get you a voucher you can use to pay for those services at the time. This way you are protected in case your plans/dates/locations change. The voucher will have no expiration and be good for the specific services listed (rather than a specific price) OR for other services worth up to the price paid. Therefore you will be guaranteed no extra costs for change of date/venue, OR you could choose a replacement of any other service I offer (valid up to the price you paid) in the event your plans for the original package selected change.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Can't afford to contribute but still like to see more of my work?</h3>
<p>No problem! You can still access my photos at several places around the web.</p>

I've studied photography in school for five years and have been taking pictures since I was old enough to hold a camera.
 
What good will this do anyway?
This campaign will help me raise the funds needed to fix my current photo equipment which has recently become unreliable and hard to use. If successful, the campaign will also enable me to buy upgraded equipment which will provide the tools needed for furthering my photographic skills. New equipment would allow for: Higher resolution images and better lighting (great for sharper pictures and large prints!), high speed and continuous shooting (good for important events or hyper kids!), and so many more options for artistic expression and learning! 
 
What's in it for you?
Perks! Choose a donation level and get stuff in return, from my gratitude and e-mail updates to posters or even wedding packages! I don't expect you to help me without getting something in return, so look through the options on the right and find something that interests you.
 
For clarification, I'd like to note that photoshoots and wedding packages paid for through this Indiegogo campaign will actually get you a voucher you can use to pay for those services at the time. This way you are protected in case your plans/dates/locations change. The voucher will have no expiration and be good for the specific services listed (rather than a specific price) OR for other services worth up to the price paid. Therefore you will be guaranteed no extra costs for change of date/venue, OR you could choose a replacement of any other service I offer (valid up to the price you paid) in the event your plans for the original package selected change.
 
Can't afford to contribute but still like to see more of my work?
No problem! You can still access my photos at several places around the web.

<p>I’m a photo-memoirist-or-something-crazy-like-that, who has produced two books, one, “Flame Spirals” as a P.O.D., and the second, a fine-art quality lithography book through a local Tucson printer, called “Hoop Dancing.” Lithography is much superior to Print-On-Demand, but it is expensive. My last books were under 100 pages and financially manageable to me, but “The Transpersonal Papers: 1861-2010” is coming in at 200 plus pages. The cost of printing 200 to 300 limited edition copies of this book runs between $9,000 to $12,000. Yikes. I am a pretty well known nocturnal photographer and writer (or at least in my own zip-code) and I’m not just some egomanical artist who thinks what I do is SO important, but I am driven, and I do hope to bring a little healing and magic into the World. (OK, my ego is pretty big, but I do try to be a good and giving man.) I’m not broke but I’m not rich. And I could use your help.</p>
<p>That’s it. Just an artist who could use a little coin.</p>
<p>Needless to say, all who donate funds will be mentioned in the Acknowledgment pages of ‘The Transpersonal Papers"" and I will think good and loving thoughts about all of you, for many months to come. Donate what you can. It really is a pretty special book, about everything from The Apache Wars in Southeastern Arizona over 100 years ago, and the Standing Stones of Callanish in Scotland, to the Flame Spirals I drew in the desert last month, and my mother’s dying of dementia, right here and right now.</p>
<p>Finally, thanks for reading this and give if you can. I could really use the help.</p>

I saw an incredible landscape; a wilderness stretching for hundreds of </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">miles. I followed the line of tree tops back from the horizon, tracing the curve of rock up </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">to my own two feet. And then, to the people standing beside me.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I saw in their eyes the same view I had seen, but reflected in their own experience. We </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">were all looking at the same thing, but each of us was seeing something different. It was </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">in that moment that I knew the Appalachian Trail wasn't just about craggy mountains, </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">deep valleys and beautiful vistas. It was about the sweat, the laughter, the sore bodies, </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and the bright eyes of ordinary people who had decided to do an extraordinary thing. </span></p><p>The Appalachian Trail, AT for short, stretches nearly 2,200 miles from Springer <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine, traversing the entire Appalachian </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">mountain range across 14 states up the Eastern seaboard.

It <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">took less than a week for me to realize that hiking the Appalachian Trail was so much </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">more than reconnecting with nature. I started hearing the AT referred to as a ""The </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">People's Trail"" which truly resonated with me. It became clear that what I was most </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">interested in on the trail were the people; their adventures, mishaps and triumphs. I </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">never grew tired of the landscapes, the views, the cleanest air and the most refreshing </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">water, but the whole time I remained most fascinated with my fellow hikers. </span></p><p>I sought to capture in my photos how an unchanging landscape can instill deep <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">change in the individuals who dare to explore it.

In March 2015, I was given a quantity of outdated photographic paper from the darkroom of the late Bret Sampson, artist and teacher. Numerous boxes and packets, the majority of which had ceased production years ago. Most were 20 to 30 years old, some far older. Given that this material had been stored for so long, it was a welcome surprise that after testing, some encouraging results were produced. Many papers seemed unusable and degraded with conventional photographic processes but responded well to more specialist and alternative techniques. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534956048/dpmwefloxqtj7nyx6p16.jpg"" src=""""/>Andrew Whittle</p><p>I then wondered what others could do with this material and appealed to a wider community of photographers and artists to accept the challenge to produce original and creative work using this paper. It was distributed to over 60 participants, purposely with an open brief, so was up to each photographer to consider how to use their selected material. Over a period of months, prints were returned using a wide variety of processes including silver gelatin, lith printing, wet collodion, paper negative and several hybrid analogue/digital techniques.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://obsolete-discontinued.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://obsolete-discontinued.com</a></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534877976/qas8crfnf6b0gyqsxijo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Almudena Romero</p><h2>Exhibitions</h2><p>Obsolete and Discontinued was launched in May 2016, at the Revela-T festival of photography in Vilassar de Dalt, Catalonia, Spain.

In March 2015, I was given a quantity of outdated photographic paper from the darkroom of the late Bret Sampson, artist and teacher. Numerous boxes and packets, the majority of which had ceased production years ago. Most were 20 to 30 years old, some far older. Given that this material had been stored for so long, it was a welcome surprise that after testing, some encouraging results were produced. Many papers seemed unusable and degraded with conventional photographic processes but responded well to more specialist and alternative techniques. Andrew WhittleI then wondered what others could do with this material and appealed to a wider community of photographers and artists to accept the challenge to produce original and creative work using this paper. It was distributed to over 60 participants, purposely with an open brief, so was up to each photographer to consider how to use their selected material. Over a period of months, prints were returned using a wide variety of processes including silver gelatin, lith printing, wet collodion, paper negative and several hybrid analogue/digital techniques.https://obsolete-discontinued.comAlmudena RomeroExhibitionsObsolete and Discontinued was launched in May 2016, at the Revela-T festival of photography in Vilassar de Dalt, Catalonia, Spain.

<h3>Support An Early Career Journalist</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Kimberly and I am about to embark on my first reporting trip abroad. I've been a journalist for just over a year and have had photography and illustration in such publications as the Playboy, Foreign Policy, the Seattle Globalist and small town newspapers in Western Washington. </p>
<p>As of right now, a colleague and myself will be in the Middle East reporting together and separately on different issues impacting the region. I will be reporting on the effects of drought and pollution on agriculture and water security in Northern Iraq, as well as other climate change and environmental issues as I come upon them.</p>
<p>It has always been my greatest dream to report from the Middle East and now I have finally been given the opportunity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As any freelance photographer and/or writer will tell, finances can get tight. I maintain another job, but given I need to cover some expenses for the trip out of pocket while still paying bills, there isn't much room in my budget for additional camera gear.</p>
<p>What I need consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>An additional camera body</li>
<li>A telephoto lens</li>
<li>A point and shoot camera</li>
<li>A harness to accommodate two DSLRs</li>
<li>Lighting equipment</li>
<li>And (finances permitting) funds to fix my broken Minolta X-700 and 50mm lens to shoot film</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Now more than ever, we are in need of unbiased quality journalism and given the nature of the industry right now, not many of us are offered the support we need in order to do the quality of work our viewers and readers deserve.</p>
<p>Becoming a freelance journalist is easily one of the most difficult undertakings I have committed to in my life, but with devotion and passion, I am absolutely set on creating the best possible work I can and doing these issues the justice they need.</p>
<p>By supporting me, you not only help ensure that great journalism can continue, but are also helping a young female journalist break into the field.</p>
<p>No part of this is easy, but journalism is something I have devoted my whole heart to and I am earnestly committed to great success in the field.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate, there are other ways to support me in meeting my goals!</p>
<p>If you own old camera equipment you aren't using anymore, I will happily accept anything offered. </p>
<p>Spreading the word is also very significant and can go a long way! </p>
</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p><p>I am grateful for any help that I receive and greatly appreciate all of you!</p></div>","Support An Early Career Journalist

Firstly, and the main, we found the way to print small run of the book. We chose Flexible Funding campaign with flexible goal. It's means that we keep all funds even if we do not meet the goal. And the book will be printed in any case (even if the campaign will not reach the goal).2. Secondly, we changed the cover (we don't have a prototype of the cover so you can see a digital mockup)3. And because to print a small edition is quite expensive, unfortunately the price of the book has increased .Hi all,  I am Ilya and I am from Russia. Me and my friends, we live in Moscow and we are into photography, graphic design and book design; apart from that, we have a collection of designer vinyl toys.  Today we would like to present a project, which is unique for our country – an art book fully dedicated to designer collectibles. The book is a collection of fantastic photographs made by our good friend, one of the most well-known Russian toy collector and toy photographer Roman Shevchenko, aka AlPred on the net. Roman started collecting designer toys in 2009 and his collection had been growing bigger and bigger up to 2014. Within five years he created a unique collection featuring a lot of rare and exclusive action figures. Some of them were produced as a single copy and some were even custom made personally for Roman. Roman was an active member of the toy community; he visited fairs all around the world, talked to designers. He was so open, communicative and enthusiastic that he got along with everyone who had a chance to get to know him. He became quite well-known in the global toy community; so after he passed away in 2014, Coarsetoys released an action figure of Omen Fade as a tribute to him. We are grateful to the company founders Mark and Sven for granting us the right to use the sketch of Omen on our book cover. It is extremely important for us.    Roman was the biggest contributor to the popularity of designer toys in Russia, largely thanks to his photographs. He did not just take photos of the action figures, every time he told a little story and introduced the figure from a very special, different angle. The figures were not just part of Roman’s collection, in his photos they came to life and acted as characters of lots of stories. His pictures always stirred interest and motivated the others not just to collect figures, but to be creative while doing it. This book contains photographs of toys by various designers, from mass produced figures by Ashley Wood and Coarse to single custom-made ones by Jon-Paul Kaiser and Squink.  The book is truly valuable because many of the figures in it are rare or unique, it is not easy to find their photos even online. Moreover, the book is made up not just from standard catalogue shots, these are awesome pictures – at times funny, at times sad, at times gloomy, at times romantic, but never leaving the viewer indifferent. We also included in the book Romans ideas on collecting, photography and on his own collection.  The following designers can be found in the book: Ashley Wood, Angry Woebots, Blamo Toys, Captain HH, Coarse, Ferg, Jon-Paul Kaiser, Kenny Wong, Luke Chueh, Michael Lau, Mr. Clement, Squink and many others.  The main goal of our project is to treasure Roman’s memory, show and share his creative work with the public. Besides, we are hoping that the funds that we manage to collect will not only cover the printing, but will be enough to pass on to Roman’s family, his wife and children. At the moment the book has already been made up, a proof copy has been printed and we are ​gathering money to start printing the whole lot. Specs:
