<p>My name is Dr. Kim Perkins and I am the author of <i>Winner Take None</i>. I have always been attracted to subjects that evoke strong feelings and rarely get talked about, and my experience and research in competition has shown me there's a great need for us to talk about what happens socially and personally when you win and when others lose.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a new consideration of competition and the role it has played in your life. I hope to spark in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for both character-building games and for inclusive community. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you be less hard on yourself and to fully engage in the possibilities open to humanity at this crucial point in our history.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about four different approaches to competitive situations and how to make your experiences and tastes work better for you. You'll hear ...</p>
<ul>
<li>How the body interprets and reacts to cues that someone is competing with you </li>
<li>How to manage people's competitive fire without your office going full Machiavelli</li>
<li>What factors make competition healthy vs. traumatic for kids and adults </li>
<li>How people are using “meta-gaming” to get the joy of playing hard without the problem of creating winners and losers </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Winner Take None</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to organizational leaders and cultural critics who want to look at competition and society in a new way. Whether you love competition or loathe the very idea, you'll find something in this book to that speaks to your heart and helps you get more of what you want.</p>
<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Dr. Kim Perkins is an organizational psychologist specializing in positive psychology, leader development, and motivation. She’s also former journalist and winning pro inline skater and has delivered keynotes at conferences all over the world.<br/><br/>With <i>Winner Take None</i>, Dr. Perkins connects meaningful stories of people competing - or assuming they're competing - with research in organizational psychology, economics, and human evolution. <i>Winner Take None</i> will give readers a fascinating perspective on competition as a phenomenon, and new ways to motivate themselves and others to create sustainable results.<br/><br/>Dr. Perkins coaches people in tech, science, entertainment and non-profits to help leaders develop and organizations to align incentives. She shares a Craftsman house with her badass husband, and works out of her home-office yurt with the aid/hampering of two fluffy cats. <br/><br/>For more information, connect with Dr. Kim Perkins at kimperkins.com, and at @imperativeform on Twitter and @thisiskimperkins on Instagram.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 (Introduction + Chapters 1-4) discusses about how we got here - the social and biological forces that make competition part of our everyday lives, whether we acknowledge it or not. We’ll identify four ways people motivate themselves around competition and how to get the most out of your method. And we’ll talk about mental models: the unspoken rules to the game that you can -and should - update as times change.<br/><br/>Part 2 (Chapters 5-7) focuses on stories and personal experiences in competition - the great and the terrible, and the lasting impact of both winning and losing. We’ll talk about rivalries and how to tame them, and how to spark a competitive fire if you‘re feeling flat. <br/><br/>Part 3 (Chapters 8-12) considers competition in organizations - how meritocracy often goes wrong, and what you can do to tame politics while tapping into people’s natural desires to do well. There will be case studies from organizations doing it right, and reimagining approaches for the 21st century.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. <br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>

<p>El <b>Encuentro Feminista
Latinoamericano y del Caribe</b> se lleva celebrando en nuestro continente desde el
año 1981, cuando miles de mujeres decidieron reunirse en Bogotá en un canto
colectivo a la lucha organizada de los movimientos feministas latinoamericanos.
</p>
<p>Desde aquel momento se
han celebrado ya 12 encuentros en diversos países de nuestra región. D<b>el 22 al
25 de noviembre de 2014, 33 años después de aquel primer encuentro,
celebraremos el XIII EFLAC en Lima, Perú. </b></p>
<p>Con cada encuentro
buscamos contribuir al fortalecimiento de los movimientos feministas en América
Latina para afianzar una democracia que incluya en la agenda de los Estados y
de las sociedades, los derechos humanos de las mujeres desde una perspectiva
feminista. </p>
<p>Nos proponemos hacer del
XIII EFLAC un acontecimiento político que reafirme ante un país conservador
como el Perú, la lucha de las mujeres y los avances logrados desde que surgió
como un movimiento revolucionario que busca transformar y politizar tanto lo
más privado de nuestras vidas como los espacios y  ámbitos públicos.</p>
<p>Este EFLAC tiene como
paraguas el título de:<strong><span>“Encuentros
en la diversidad: rebeldías, creaciones y transformaciones”. </span></strong>Una rebeldía que también se orienta a
transformar el sistema capitalista, neoliberal, colonial, patriarcal,
heteronormativo y racista, lo que hemos llamado la trenza de dominación que
oprime nuestras vidas, cuerpos y territorios. Entre los varios marcos o enfoques
que orientan y dan sentido a nuestras luchas feministas en América Latina y el
Caribe hoy, destacamos tres:<b> la mirada intercultural crítica, la sostenibilidad
de la vida y la perspectiva política sobre el cuerpo.</b></p>
<p>El XIII Encuentro se
desarrollará escuchando y acogiendo la multiplicidad de vivencias de nuestros
cuerpos y prácticas políticas feministas. Sera un espacio para propiciar
talleres, actividades lúdicas, paneles, performances, diálogos, conferencias,
actividades de calle, grafitis, manifestaciones, conciertos, proyecciones,
tertulias y propuestas, que dejen fluir los diferentes saberes, desde
metodologías animadas por la conjunción necesaria entre razón y emoción. </p>
<p><b>Un llamado al a solidaridad feminista</b></p>
<p>Desde el comité organizador del XIII EFLAC queremos
hacer<b> un llamado a la solidaridad internacional feminista</b> para contribuir a la
autogestión de nuestro encuentro.</p>
<p></p><p>Como saben nos enfrentamos a una situación difícil,
el monto conseguido para la realización de este evento es mucho menor que en otros encuentros anteriores.  No
obstante, desde el comité consideramos que la falta de fondos no puede, ni debe
poner en riesgo la celebración de este encuentro histórico. Es por ello que
consideramos de vital importancia repensar la forma de realizar nuestra
actividad, considerando esta situación un reto y una oportunidad para trabajar
de manera autogestionaria. </p>
<p>La autogestión ha sido una forma de trabajar que
garantiza nuestra autonomía como movimiento de feminismos diversos. <b>Los
colectivos y organizaciones feministas de todo tipo hemos hecho de la
autogestión una dimensión central dentro de lo político</b>, ya sea a través de
actividades para la recaudación de fondos o con nuestro trabajo cotidiano, como
activistas y mujeres, muchas veces invisible y subvalorado. </p>
<p>Es por ello que desde las múltiples comisiones que
conforman la organización del Encuentro estamos buscando incorporar formas
autogestionarias como la creación de una red de alojamiento solidario, la
realización de ferias y campañas como esta para la recaudación de fondos. Dado
el carácter regional del Encuentro, que convoca a mujeres feministas de toda latinoamericana,
las invitamos a colaborar también con esta campaña de recaudación de fondos
mediante su aporte solidario. </p>
<p><b>El dinero recaudado será destinado a apoyar la participación de compañeras de
organizaciones de base peruanas con poco acceso a recursos económicos. </b></p><p><b><b>Con cada 70 dólares recaudados estarás garantizando el alojamiento solidario y la alimentación  de una compañera  de bases de organizaciones feministas del Perú, </b><b>durante los cuatro días que dura el encuentro. </b></b></p>
<p><b><i>¡Anímate a colaborar con este encuentro, cada

<p>Since 1981, when for the first time, thousands
of women from all parts of the continent met in Bogotá to strengthen the
collective struggle of Latin American feminist movements, the “<b>Latin American and
Caribbean Feminist Encounters” </b>(EFLAC) have become an important place for
forging connections between our diverse struggles. </p>
<p>33 years later, twelve Feminist
Encounters have been organized in different countries in our region. <b>This
november, from the 22nd to the 25th, the 13th EFLAC will take place in Lima,
Peru.</b></p>
<p>Every Feminist Encounter seeks to
contribute to the strengthening of the feminist movements in Latin America
fighting for a democracy that puts women’s human rights from a feminist
perspective on the agenda of state and society.</p>
<p>We strive to make the 13th EFLAC a
political gathering that reaffirms the centrality of women’s struggles as well
as celebrates the advances gained since Latin American feminist movements
emerged as revolutionary movements seeking to transform and politicize the most
private spaces of our lives as much as the public space – goals even more
central in a conservative country like Peru.</p>
<p>The 13th EFLAC bears the title<strong><span>“Encounters in Diversity: Insubordination,
Creations, and Transformations”.</span></strong> Our insubordination is geared towards transforming
the capitalist, neoliberal, colonial, patriarchal, heteronormative, and racist
system that oppresses and exploits our lives, bodies, and territories. From
the varied frameworks and approaches that orient and give meaning to our
feminist strugggles in Latin America and the Caribbean today, we focus on three
in particular: <b>This Feminist Encounter will be guided by a critical
intercultural perspective, depart from a political perspective on our bodies,
and engage with the sustainability of life.</b></p>
<p>The 13th Feminist Encounter will be a
space for listening to and learning from the multiplicity of ways to experience
our bodies and feminist political practice. It will bring together workshops,
activities, panels, performances, dialogues, conferences, street art, grafittis,
manifestations, concerts, showings, conversations, and proposals, stemming from
different knowledges and from different methodologies merging reason and
emotion in distinct ways.</p>
<p><b>A Call for

<p>As the
organizing committee of  the 13th EFLAC,
<i><b>we call for your international feminist solidarity in raising funds for our Feminist

<p>Currently, we
are faced with a very difficult situation as we avail  of a much lower amount of funding than for the last two Feminist Encounters. Nevertheless, we hold that
the lack of funding should not endanger this crucial Feminist Encounter taking
place in a decisive moment in Latin American politics. This is why we consider
it of vital importance to rethink our practices, seeing this situation as a
challenge and an opportunity to work in a self-funded manner. </p>
<p>Self-Funding
has been a form of collective organizing that has guaranteed our autonomy as
diverse feminist movement. Many feminist collectives and organizations have
converted self-funding into a central dimension of our politics, be it through fundraising
activities or be it through our – often invisible – work as activists and as
women in our daily life. </p>
<p>This is why
we, from the multiple commissions that together form the organizing committee
of the Feminist Encounter, seek to incorporate and promote different ways of self-funding.
We are organizing a network for solidary accomodation during the Feminist
Encounter as well as fundraising fairs and campaigns. As the Feminist Encounter

El Encuentro Feminista
Latinoamericano y del Caribe se lleva celebrando en nuestro continente desde el
año 1981, cuando miles de mujeres decidieron reunirse en Bogotá en un canto
colectivo a la lucha organizada de los movimientos feministas latinoamericanos.

Desde aquel momento se
han celebrado ya 12 encuentros en diversos países de nuestra región. Del 22 al
25 de noviembre de 2014, 33 años después de aquel primer encuentro,
celebraremos el XIII EFLAC en Lima, Perú. 
Con cada encuentro
buscamos contribuir al fortalecimiento de los movimientos feministas en América
Latina para afianzar una democracia que incluya en la agenda de los Estados y
de las sociedades, los derechos humanos de las mujeres desde una perspectiva
feminista. 
Nos proponemos hacer del
XIII EFLAC un acontecimiento político que reafirme ante un país conservador
como el Perú, la lucha de las mujeres y los avances logrados desde que surgió
como un movimiento revolucionario que busca transformar y politizar tanto lo
más privado de nuestras vidas como los espacios y  ámbitos públicos.
Este EFLAC tiene como
paraguas el título de:“Encuentros
en la diversidad: rebeldías, creaciones y transformaciones”. Una rebeldía que también se orienta a
transformar el sistema capitalista, neoliberal, colonial, patriarcal,
heteronormativo y racista, lo que hemos llamado la trenza de dominación que
oprime nuestras vidas, cuerpos y territorios. Entre los varios marcos o enfoques
que orientan y dan sentido a nuestras luchas feministas en América Latina y el
Caribe hoy, destacamos tres: la mirada intercultural crítica, la sostenibilidad
de la vida y la perspectiva política sobre el cuerpo.
El XIII Encuentro se
desarrollará escuchando y acogiendo la multiplicidad de vivencias de nuestros
cuerpos y prácticas políticas feministas. Sera un espacio para propiciar
talleres, actividades lúdicas, paneles, performances, diálogos, conferencias,
actividades de calle, grafitis, manifestaciones, conciertos, proyecciones,
tertulias y propuestas, que dejen fluir los diferentes saberes, desde
metodologías animadas por la conjunción necesaria entre razón y emoción. 
Un llamado al a solidaridad feminista
Desde el comité organizador del XIII EFLAC queremos
hacer un llamado a la solidaridad internacional feminista para contribuir a la
autogestión de nuestro encuentro.
Como saben nos enfrentamos a una situación difícil,
el monto conseguido para la realización de este evento es mucho menor que en otros encuentros anteriores.  No
obstante, desde el comité consideramos que la falta de fondos no puede, ni debe
poner en riesgo la celebración de este encuentro histórico. Es por ello que
consideramos de vital importancia repensar la forma de realizar nuestra
actividad, considerando esta situación un reto y una oportunidad para trabajar
de manera autogestionaria. 
La autogestión ha sido una forma de trabajar que
garantiza nuestra autonomía como movimiento de feminismos diversos. Los
colectivos y organizaciones feministas de todo tipo hemos hecho de la
autogestión una dimensión central dentro de lo político, ya sea a través de
actividades para la recaudación de fondos o con nuestro trabajo cotidiano, como
activistas y mujeres, muchas veces invisible y subvalorado. 
Es por ello que desde las múltiples comisiones que
conforman la organización del Encuentro estamos buscando incorporar formas
autogestionarias como la creación de una red de alojamiento solidario, la
realización de ferias y campañas como esta para la recaudación de fondos. Dado
el carácter regional del Encuentro, que convoca a mujeres feministas de toda latinoamericana,
las invitamos a colaborar también con esta campaña de recaudación de fondos
mediante su aporte solidario. 
El dinero recaudado será destinado a apoyar la participación de compañeras de
organizaciones de base peruanas con poco acceso a recursos económicos. Con cada 70 dólares recaudados estarás garantizando el alojamiento solidario y la alimentación  de una compañera  de bases de organizaciones feministas del Perú, durante los cuatro días que dura el encuentro. 
¡Anímate a colaborar con este encuentro, cada
aporte, cada mano solidaria cuenta! ¡Contribuye con la defensa de los derechos
de las mujeres, y al fortalecimiento de los diversos movimientos feministas de

<p>Canada: F*ckin’ Eh! is our class project, started because we had to do something, but finished out of love. We’re seeking funding to have it brought to life. Currently it’s in a pile of different papers, and we need help to get it out to those that share our love… For Canada!</p>
<p>One day in Canadian Studies, our professor gave us what seemed like an easy assignment. Write a pamphlet on why Canada is great. Well, Canada IS great, so it seemed like a simple process to put it down on paper. But then the old Canadian nemesis reared its ugly head. I have stared into the face of my downfall, and named it politeness, the demon that kills with kindness. Neither I nor any of my classmates wanted to be seen as arrogant or rude, so every time we wrote something for the project we started it with ""in my humble opinion"". Some of us even started apologizing within our writings!!!</p>
<p>In order to resolve this seemingly insurmountable problem, we adjourned to the local pub and started in on the pitchers of (Canadian) beer. After a sufficient number of pints and a spirited hockey debate (only a small amount of blood; real fights require someone to be carted off to the hospital), we started writing in earnest. Screw pamphlets, we were each writing epic novels! So why not really make it a book? We got together and spoke to our Prof about combining our works into a much larger project.</p>
<p>Which is what brings us here. Your funding will go towards a competent editor (I ramble when drinking), formatting, printing, and getting the word out to all and sundry (an editor would know what that means. I don't. Just read it somewhere and always wanted to use it).</p>
<p>So stop by, read a little, fund a lot, and be not afraid to tell us why you see Canada as amazing. Whether you're Canadian, love one, like one, barely tolerate their presence, or secretly want to be one, it would be great to hear from you!!!!</p>
<p>Any monies gathered will go towards making this project a reality. While the creative has been taken care of, the print and distribution aspects are where the funding will go. Should the target not be reached we will simply print enough books to take care of the perks, instead of printing and distributing extra copies for sale in the book market.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Adam Fortier, and I am a Canadian. I've been one for as long as I can remember, and instead of kicking the habit, I've decided to embrace it. After all, there's nothing I'd rather be. I've worked and travelled abroad for a number of years, and in all that time my heart has remained here. It's with this spirit in mind I wanted to put together a love letter to my country of birth and choice.</p>
<p>You may ask why I chose this manner to present my book, and there are a couple of reasons. First off, I'm Canadian, and we're all a little odd (perhaps it's the cold, it does something to us). Secondly, I wanted to share everything in an unapologetic way, shouting it from the rooftops, and felt this was the best way to keep things unfiltered. So enjoy the writings of the lovely students over at Flurry University, and bask in their love of this country.</p>
<p>While the University and Students are fictional, the sentiments expressed are real. This is a project that is from my heart, but is comprised of many of my own observations, researching, as well as others’. I love this country, but a large part of what makes it great is the people I share it with.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’ve worked in publishing for a number of years, and given the choice of doing anything with my time, this is where I’d prefer to be. Too often do I see people create properties for the “North American” audience, and not just for Canadians, or those close to us. THIS project is for Canadians first, North Americans second.</p>

I’ve worked in publishing for a number of years, and given the choice of doing anything with my time, this is where I’d prefer to be. Too often do I see people create properties for the “North American” audience, and not just for Canadians, or those close to us. THIS project is for Canadians first, North Americans second.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I am an autistic  adult, an autism and disability rights activist and I run the first ever neurodiversity community lending library.   I am also a parent to an amazing autistic kid and I know how hard it is to find books that will help him to find a sense of pride in his autistic identity.   In my work with the library, I come across a lot of books about autism.  Children's books about autism are mostly written for classmates or siblings and are authored by non autistic people.  These books generally talk about autism as a negative thing and are not at all reflective of autism acceptance or the neurodiversity paradigm.    I want to change that, so I wrote a children's book featuring the Neurodivergent Narwhals.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The narwhals started as a way for me to bring short, accessible information about autism acceptance in the form of posters and infographics to people who are mostly unfamiliar with neurodiversity or the social model of disability.  They have become very popular and have been purchased by school districts, children's therapists, parent groups and more to help teach people about autism.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Autistic children hear so many negative and harmful messages about autism.  It is so important for them to know that they are amazing and loved.  It is my hope that this will be a book that is not only for autistic children but also for the people who love them and accept them for exactly who they are. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The library needs to raise $2500 for initial printing, getting an ISBN for the book, printing and acquiring a separate ISBN for a companion coloring book,  editing, and paying to convert the print book into an e-book.</p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal, I will split the funds between neurodiversity community lending libraries and to help purchase existing books for people to start one in their communities.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I realize that not everyone can contribute to this campaign financially but  it is easy to support us by sharing information with your friends and family and on social media.  Please help to get the word out about the Neurodivergent Narwhals Book!  </p>

<p>In March 2015, Copper Canyon Press and Richard Siken launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for independent nonprofit poetry publishing. Over 500 donors in 33 countries helped us to reach over 300% of our goal in just one month.

<p><b>THE BOOK </b></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>War of the Foxes</i> tells an artist’s story, asking what it means to be called to make—whether it is a self, love, war, or art—and what it means to answer that call. The opening poem asks an essential question: To supply the world with what?</p>
<p>In the ten years since the publication of <i>Crush</i>, Siken has been exploring this question and many others, pushing paint around on a canvas until he found something worth keeping. As a supporter of this campaign, you will be among the first to read the new poems, the first to see the paint strokes and discover what they can mean. </p>
<p>Your contribution to the success of this campaign will enable Copper Canyon Press, a nonprofit independent publisher, to supply the world with more extraordinary books of poetry like <i>War of the Foxes.</i></p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Our goal was to raise $10,000 towards our 2015-2016 publishing seasons while reaching hundreds of poets, poetry readers, and Richard Siken fans. With your help we have raised over $30,000 and counting. </p>
<p>As Siken says, “The role of independent publishing is to be an open channel. There’s not a lot of money in it and there’s not a lot of money for it, and so the people who are dedicated to it are dedicated to the author, and the reader, and the work. That’s significant. Copper Canyon Press is an independent publisher, and independent publishing needs our help.” </p>
<p></p>
<p>Indeed—as a nonprofit poetry publisher, sales revenue covers only half of the annual publishing expenses at Copper Canyon. That means we rely on the generosity of people like Richard Siken and you; those who believe in poetry’s potency and importance. Your donations enable us to supply the world with extraordinary books like <i>War of the Foxes</i>; reaching our goal and beyond will allow us to publish 18-20 books in 2016. </p>

At the time I tagged ""Vol. 1"" onto the end of the title, which was a private joke meaning that I had SO MUCH MORE to say. Well, my joke was so private that I was the only one that got it, and ever since, people have been asking me when Vol. 2 was coming. Because they wanted MORE.</p><p><b>Well, the time is upon us.

</p><p>
</p><p><i>Then there were the clothes and bed clothes.
People washed their shirts every two weeks or so, but their underclothes far
less frequently. There was this one man, for instance, who was known to wash
his underclothes once a year, at Christmas. He would then wear them until the
summer, at which point he would take them off, turn them inside-out, and wear
them that way until it was time for another washing.</i></p><i>

Apparently
people didn't wear their underwear to bed, so that may have helped slightly, although
that meant their bedding was the recipient of the dirt. The bedding was washed
maybe once a year, in the spring. It was washed in, um, urine, which was considered to be a very good cleanser on account
of the ammonia. The downside was that the smell stayed in for weeks afterwards

""raking them up to their asses,"" or </i>að gelda þá<i>, ""to castrate them."" Whoa. Not hard to

On this book I have decided not to work with a traditional publisher like I did on the last Little Book, which means that I have to bear all the costs of production by myself. This includes the cost of illustrations and the printing of a first print run of 3,000 copies. Those will be mailed to those of you who pre-order a book, and the rest will be distributed to book stores in Iceland. (My plan now is to hit the ring road and distribute the book myself while blogging the experience ... more on that later.) The printing and illustration part alone costs around USD 9,000, and Indiegogo takes a substantial cut of whatever is collected. So all in all I need to raise a minimum of USD 10,000.</p><p>I am producing this book on an absolute shoestring: a group of amazing volunteers have helped, or are helping, with the editing, and my wonderful husband is designing the book and (like me) won't get paid until all the other costs have been paid. </p><p>What I am asking you to do is to <b>pre-order a copy of the book</b> and/or to <b>help by pledging</b>. A list of perks may be found off to the right here. In the event that I don't raise the full amount needed, I will still use what comes in to print as many copies as possible (in other words you will <i>definitely</i> get your book). If I exceed my goal (oh happy day), the proceeds will be used to pay a little extra to my illustrator (who is keeping her costs to an absolute minimum), to pay the graphic designer (EPI), and to print more copies. </p><p>
</p><p>I should mention that the
printed version of the first Little Book of the Icelanders has not been readily
available outside of Iceland. It is possible to order it from the publisher,
but the shipping and handling fees are higher than the cost of the book, so it
is expensive. A lot of people have voiced their dissatisfaction with this, and unfortunately
it has been beyond my control. If you order the new book through this campaign,
however, I will be happy to ship it to you – whether you live overseas or in
Iceland. I am keeping the shipping fees to an absolute minimum … you pay only
what I pay for shipping, and the handling is free. </p>
<p>One more thing: I
cannot guarantee that overseas shipping will be possible after this initial
print run – or, indeed, if there will be another print run. That all depends on
how this venture works out. In other words, if you want to make sure that you
get your hands on a copy of the book, you should definitely order now, and not
wait until later.  </p><p></p><p>The estimated delivery time is May-June.</p><p><b>Thanks in advance for your help - you rock!</b></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>I realize that not everyone is able to contribute financially. If that's you and you still want to help, I would love it if you could help get the word out there and make some noise about this campaign. If you want you can use the sharing tools provided by Indiegogo.

<p> </p>
<p>In 2006, Kurt Angle changed jobs, from wrestling for World Wrestling Entertainment to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. The character he played—using his own name, his own credentials as an Olympic Gold Medalist, and his own family—was a daring expose on classic pro wrestling tropes.

<p>Angle's characteristics lean heavily towards superheroism or supervillainy, and has been known to shift between the two in the span of weeks. It's not uncommon for pro wrestlers to change from being heroes to villains, but rarely without altering aspects of their personality or character. Angle is capable of being both without changing <em>anything</em><em>. </em></p>
<p>This essay will chronicle the shifts in Angle's character from 2006 to the autumn of 2011.

<li>We want to be able to pull news from literary blogs and sites to our front page. </li>
<li>We want the ability to create writing ""groups,"" whether as a collaboration on a single project, or just a quiet corner for writers who know and trust one another to workshop their earliest of drafts. </li>
<li>We'd like to have Facebook Connect enabled, which would play well with our Facebook page for the Velvet. </li>
<li>Specialized sections for reviews and interviews, editorials and the like. </li>
<li>And then, quite frankly, we'd like to make it look good. No one wants to go to a site that's ugly, and the whole point of the Velvet is for people to want to be here. </li>

<div>If we don't meet our goal and it's not enough to hire a developer, all proceeds will go to operating costs for the site. </div>

We want to be able to pull news from literary blogs and sites to our front page. 
We want the ability to create writing ""groups,"" whether as a collaboration on a single project, or just a quiet corner for writers who know and trust one another to workshop their earliest of drafts. 
We'd like to have Facebook Connect enabled, which would play well with our Facebook page for the Velvet. 
Specialized sections for reviews and interviews, editorials and the like. 
And then, quite frankly, we'd like to make it look good. No one wants to go to a site that's ugly, and the whole point of the Velvet is for people to want to be here. 


If we don't meet our goal and it's not enough to hire a developer, all proceeds will go to operating costs for the site. 

If we go over our goal, or if we find that our needs don't require the full amount of what we do receive, whatever is left over from the redesign will be split 50/50 between operating costs for the site (hosting fees, etc.) and to Child's Play Charity.




Other Ways You Can Help


Spread the word - send people to The Velvet proper, or to our Facebook community page, or to our pitch here. 
If you know a web developer who could provide us with a deal, we'd love that, too. 


We didn't build the infrastructure for this site, but it's our home. And a home that we'd like to share with you. Help us make this into a place where people from all walks of life - all ages and backgrounds - can come together as one and help one another achieve the success we wish for ourselves and everyone around us.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

I have been asked to help write a book about the only survivor of the infamous ""Freeway Killer"", William Bonin, who murdered at least 21 young men and boys between 1979 and 1980 in Southern California. David McVicker, whom you can meet in the video above and who was only 14 at the time Bonin picked him up hitch-hiking, raped him anally and actually began to strangle him to death, said he ""called out to God to save him,"" and Bonin--who had never shown any remorse for any of his killings--suddenly released him, drove him close to his home and let him escape alive. <br/><br/>Months later, David was hitch-hiking again--but this time it was because he was going to testify at Bonin's trial, the only victim who could ever do so, and had no ride to the courthouse.<br/><br/>However, that was not the end of the story, for David has since suffered terribly from nightmares and PTSD, and you can see signs of these effects in his video, above. During the 16 years that Bonin was on California's Death Row, David was often vilified for his testimony, which helped to send this monster to his death. He has been abused by those who believe that his experience has left him somehow unworthy of compassion. He has been beaten, cursed, and threatened for his continuing work to see that Bonin's accomplices, who are also doing time for the murders they participated in, do not get back to the streets, where they can harm anyone else. <br/><br/>One of those accomplices, James Michael Munro, is going up for parole January 28th, and David will be present to encourage the Parole Board not to release this man who has said that he will kill again if he is granted his freedom, and has even stated that he is hoping to have David killed to prevent his appearance at this hearing.<br/><br/>Despite beatings, threats and many other kinds of trauma, David has always maintained that--as two of the victims' mothers pleaded with him to do at Bonin's trial--it was up to him to speak up for all of the boys who did not escape, and for every victim of horrific abuse, because he knows first hand how hard it is to bear the stigma of being so treated. David says that he never got the help he needed to let him recover from that barely-missed appointment with death, and prays that his story might help parents and loved ones of other victims to understand that surviving doesn't just mean you live through it... it means you live through it over and over again.<br/><br/>Bonin's story was retold in 2010, in a movie entitled ""The Freeway Killer"", which can be found at <a href=""http://www.hulu.com/watch/291064"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.hulu.com/watch/291064</a>. David's book will be entitled ""Raped Again, by David McVicker"" and we are desperately trying to make it available before Munro's parole hearing in late January. If you believe David's story should be told, please help us to do so, and tell others about this need, as well.<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Our goal is to get the book finished and published by January 25th, 2014.

I have been asked to help write a book about the only survivor of the infamous ""Freeway Killer"", William Bonin, who murdered at least 21 young men and boys between 1979 and 1980 in Southern California. David McVicker, whom you can meet in the video above and who was only 14 at the time Bonin picked him up hitch-hiking, raped him anally and actually began to strangle him to death, said he ""called out to God to save him,"" and Bonin--who had never shown any remorse for any of his killings--suddenly released him, drove him close to his home and let him escape alive. Months later, David was hitch-hiking again--but this time it was because he was going to testify at Bonin's trial, the only victim who could ever do so, and had no ride to the courthouse.However, that was not the end of the story, for David has since suffered terribly from nightmares and PTSD, and you can see signs of these effects in his video, above. During the 16 years that Bonin was on California's Death Row, David was often vilified for his testimony, which helped to send this monster to his death. He has been abused by those who believe that his experience has left him somehow unworthy of compassion. He has been beaten, cursed, and threatened for his continuing work to see that Bonin's accomplices, who are also doing time for the murders they participated in, do not get back to the streets, where they can harm anyone else. One of those accomplices, James Michael Munro, is going up for parole January 28th, and David will be present to encourage the Parole Board not to release this man who has said that he will kill again if he is granted his freedom, and has even stated that he is hoping to have David killed to prevent his appearance at this hearing.Despite beatings, threats and many other kinds of trauma, David has always maintained that--as two of the victims' mothers pleaded with him to do at Bonin's trial--it was up to him to speak up for all of the boys who did not escape, and for every victim of horrific abuse, because he knows first hand how hard it is to bear the stigma of being so treated. David says that he never got the help he needed to let him recover from that barely-missed appointment with death, and prays that his story might help parents and loved ones of other victims to understand that surviving doesn't just mean you live through it... it means you live through it over and over again.Bonin's story was retold in 2010, in a movie entitled ""The Freeway Killer"", which can be found at http://www.hulu.com/watch/291064. David's book will be entitled ""Raped Again, by David McVicker"" and we are desperately trying to make it available before Munro's parole hearing in late January. If you believe David's story should be told, please help us to do so, and tell others about this need, as well.What We Need & What You GetOur goal is to get the book finished and published by January 25th, 2014.

<p>The overwhelming majority of U.S. military members serve our country with honor and integrity. Many risk their lives on a daily basis to protect and defend not only our great nation and people, but also the nations and peoples of the world. I have had the honor and privilege to serve with the men and women of the U.S. Navy for the majority of my life, and I can say without reservation that they are the most amazing, dedicated, and courageous people you will ever meet.</p>
<p><i><b>This book is not about them.</b></i></p>
<p>This book is instead about the practices of the commercial sex industry near a few overseas U.S. military bases, and how a small number of servicemen have been lured into participating in this evil business.</p>
<p><i>A Few Bad Men</i> will present a brutally accurate account of sex trade operators near some of our overseas locations, and of U.S. servicemember’s participation in their exploitation of sex-trafficked victims and forced prostitutes. While most people are no doubt familiar with the tales of foreign prostitutes and our servicemen stationed overseas, few are likely aware of the extent to which sex traffickers are operating just outside our base gates, or of the physical and psychological damage inflicted upon the victims of their appalling business.</p>
<p>Weaving together a wide variety of sources – case reports and field research from international organizations, U.S. State Department reports, recent military cases involving human trafficking and prostitution, interviews of servicemembers and victims, and personal anecdotes - <i>A Few Bad Men</i> will expose this outrageous business and its destructive consequences to not only the victims and their families, but also to the reputation of our military forces abroad and to the strategic interests of the United States.</p><p></p>
<h1>Why Tell This Story?</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, there exists a subculture near some of our overseas military that not only condones sexual depravity but revels in it. Near bases and liberty ports in The Philippines, Thailand, Korea, Japan, and many others, sailors and soldiers are lured into engaging in reprehensible behavior with prostitutes and victims of sex trafficking. While senior military leadership and the majority of servicemembers are repulsed by this ugly business and are committed to ending its operations, it still continues to infect the morality and behavior of a few servicemembers.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of writing <i>A Few Bad Men</i> is to expose this
abhorrent business and document the destructive consequences to both the victims and to the reputation of the United States abroad. My hope is that this will lead to a discussion about how to bring this repugnant behavior and the subculture that enables it to an end.</p>
<p>However, there is a second and equally worthy purpose for writing this book. There is a disturbing epidemic of sexual misconduct currently
sweeping through our military. In the fiscal year ending in September 2013, more than 5,000 sexual assault complaints were filed, a 60% increase over 2012, when 3,374 were filed!</p>
<p>Why is this happening? Some DoD representatives deny the
numbers represent an actual increase, instead suggesting the rise is due
primarily to increased reporting while the number of incidents has remained
relatively steady.</p>
<p>Perhaps this excuse accounts for some of the increased
reporting, but it leaves unanswered the far more important question. Why are
there so many incidents occurring in the first place? An anonymous survey conducted in early 2013 indicated that as many as 26,000 service members encountered some type of unwanted sexual contact or sexual assault!</p>
<p>The second purpose of this book is to illustrate the link
between this subculture of depravity and the behavior of some servicemembers
when they are at work. Any person who believes it is ok to victimize young
girls who are forced into prostitution by poverty and hopelessness (or even trafficked into it), quite obviously has a lack of respect for all women. Of course he is going to carry that lack of respect and his objectification of women into the workplace, and then treat his female coworkers with the same lack of respect.</p>
<p>By exposing this destructive subculture, I hope to help bring an end to the epidemic of sexual misconduct in our military.</p><p></p>

during our bedtime routine of reading books and telling stories to our 3 young
kids. I made up a story about a purple dragon named Purpee, and his
friends.  My kids loved the story and
started asking for Purpee stories every night. 
Each night Purpee seemed to become a little more adventurous.</span></p>
<p>One night my daughter
Brianna had an idea, “Why don’t we turn these stories into a kids book
series?”… and building on her inspiration I tried to think of a way we could
make these books different from all of the other great children’s books out
there, and then it hit me.</p>
<p>We got to work right away. Brianna
started writing the manuscript and brainstorming more adventures. Then we
started sketching. First Brianna, then me, and then we hired an illustrator to
bring our characters to life. The next thing we knew; Purpee the Purple Dragon,
Stinky the Skunk, Shelly and Sunny, twin turtles, and
Smokey the Dragon were alive……</p>

this dragon, making
these books different from most other children’s books.</p>

the children and then spend time asking them what adventures they would like to
see Purpee and his friends go on next. </p>
<p><b>What adventures would they
go on if they could? </b></p>
<p>We will encourage their
imaginations, collect their ideas, and even have them create some of the
scenes, just like my 7-year-old daughter did for the first 2 books.</p>
<p>Then, we will collect the

will include the names of those children that contributed. These sick children
will live through Purpee and his friends….</p>

<p>And if you think this
project couldn’t be any more special – here’s another memorable part of it.  Late last year a brave 10-year-old boy from
our town, Michael Feeney, sadly passed away after struggling with a rare form
of cancer.  Not only did he inspire a
community, but he inspired Brianna and I in planning this project and also led
us to a great organization, Go 4 the Goal, that has helped
us to coordinate with the 12 hospitals that we will be visiting.  Michael exhibited many of the qualities of our
adventurous Purpee the Purple Dragon and we will be dedicating the first book
in our series to his memory.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/496454/files/20140409124506-Mike_Feeney_edited-1.png?1397072706"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Each book

<p></p></div>","***  Our campaign has ended, but the journey has just begun, follow us here for updates and photos from our hospital visits:www.Facebook.com/PurpeeTheDragon ***Purpee the Purple
Dragon is the the main character in our new children’s book series. Purpee will serve
to inspire kids around the world and allow children with pediatric cancer to
live vicariously through an adventurous purple dragon and his friends.
Here’s our story, our
project details and how you can help us make it happen….It all started one night
during our bedtime routine of reading books and telling stories to our 3 young
kids. I made up a story about a purple dragon named Purpee, and his
friends.  My kids loved the story and
started asking for Purpee stories every night. 
Each night Purpee seemed to become a little more adventurous.
One night my daughter
Brianna had an idea, “Why don’t we turn these stories into a kids book
series?”… and building on her inspiration I tried to think of a way we could
make these books different from all of the other great children’s books out
there, and then it hit me.
We got to work right away. Brianna
started writing the manuscript and brainstorming more adventures. Then we
started sketching. First Brianna, then me, and then we hired an illustrator to
bring our characters to life. The next thing we knew; Purpee the Purple Dragon,
Stinky the Skunk, Shelly and Sunny, twin turtles, and
Smokey the Dragon were alive……
Our
project is to produce the first 2 books in the Purpee the Purple Dragon series
and print 2,500 copies to give out to pediatric cancer patients in hospitals
across the US – your backing will help us to do this.
This
book series will inspire children with cancer allowing them to live through
this dragon, making
these books different from most other children’s books.
 
We will read the books to
the children and then spend time asking them what adventures they would like to
see Purpee and his friends go on next. 
What adventures would they
go on if they could? 
We will encourage their
imaginations, collect their ideas, and even have them create some of the
scenes, just like my 7-year-old daughter did for the first 2 books.
Then, we will collect the
thoughts and pictures and use them to write more books in the series, which
will include the names of those children that contributed. These sick children
will live through Purpee and his friends….

And if you think this
project couldn’t be any more special – here’s another memorable part of it.  Late last year a brave 10-year-old boy from
our town, Michael Feeney, sadly passed away after struggling with a rare form
of cancer.  Not only did he inspire a
community, but he inspired Brianna and I in planning this project and also led
us to a great organization, Go 4 the Goal, that has helped
us to coordinate with the 12 hospitals that we will be visiting.  Michael exhibited many of the qualities of our
adventurous Purpee the Purple Dragon and we will be dedicating the first book
in our series to his memory.
Our plan is to visit the following hospitals, but we will expand to the west coast and other parts of the US if
funding allows....
Yale New Haven Children's
Hospital
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
Massachusetts General Hospital
The Children's Hospital at Albany Medical Center
Joseph M. Sanzari Children's Hospital 
St Peter's University Hospital 
Cohen Children's Medical Center of NY
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia
St. Christopher's Hospital for Children
Nemours/Alfred I. DuPont Hospital for Children
Children's National Medical Center
Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center
Did you know that more than
11,000 young people are diagnosed with cancer every year?? And many of them
will spend most of their lives in and out of hospitals lonely and
depressed.  While Brianna and I can’t
cure cancer, we can bring Purpee’s adventures to these children, and then,
through the book series, help them to create their own adventures, even if they
are in a hospital.

So now we need your help!!
The first two manuscripts are written (see descriptions below), the illustrator
is ready to go, and hundreds of kids in 12 hospitals are waiting to be inspired….  
Your financial support will
fund the production and printing of the first two books and our trips to the hospitals.
Our goal is to print 2,500 books. If we exceed our goal, we will go to more
hospitals, give out more books, and inspire more children. 
We plan on giving these sick
children the chance to experience adventures that they may never get to live
out. 
Not only will you feel good
about supporting this project, but we have created some great rewards (see
below). 
We have one
month to fund this project - we hope you’ll join us today. 
Purpee the
Purple Dragon is the main character in this new and exciting children’s
books series.
The cast of
characters in Purpee’s world are Stinky the Skunk, Shelly and Sunny – sister
and brother twin turtle’s, and Smoky the Dragon who invariably can be found
accompanying Purpee on his adventures.
Each book
contains a moral lesson, which is cleverly hidden within the words of the
story. Through my own lessons of hands-on parenting, I have learned that
entertaining a child with a story that is engaging and exciting is more
effective than simply lecturing them on the ‘right’ thing to do.
For most pledges you will receive in return perks/rewards.  In addition to the two books
described above, perks/rewards for pledges also include a cool Purpee hologram
bookmark as well cool kids t-shirts.  These are perfect
gifts for all children.  What kid wouldn't like a dragon
t-shirt?
Details of each perk are listed along the entire right column of this page. You can see images of all perks/rewards below. You should receive your awards in September....

<p>Hi, I’m Esther Mathieu. 
I’m 18, and I’m a college student living in New York City.  Every summer for the last three years, I’ve
attended the Rena’s Promise International Creative Writing Camp.  I’ve taken poetry and fiction classes, gone
to shows, talked to writers, engaged with the literary world, and grown an incredible amount
in my own writing.  This year, I’m going
back as a counselor, but for every one of the times I’ve attended the camp as a

Rena’s Promise Foundation.  Many of my
friends and I would never have been able to go at all if we hadn’t had the
financial support.  This year, the
foundation really needs help raising money for scholarships for the
camp’s students.  I’m trying to raise
$600 to support the camp.  Rena’s Promise
is the place in which I have most grown, and I have watched the other campers
grow—in themselves, in their voices, in their writing—just as much.  I hope you’ll be able to help us help new
young writers find their voices, help them grow and learn and have just as much

In June of 2013 while on a vision fast in the wilderness with Animas Valley Institute I emerged from my cocoon and I have not been the same since. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">I transformed from caterpillar to butterfly...from girl to woman...from being hidden to being seen...and from Julia to Ruby. I have come into my wholeness, my Dharma, and my Soul's purpose. I feel ripe and overflowing, ready to offer what I do to the larger World in service of something much larger than me.

I channel Ancient feminine mysteries through my writing, art, and performance. I am a voice for the unheard voices!

I am to go to the Mediterranean (the vagina of the World) to connect to the history of the land in relation to the Dark Goddess and channel messages for my next book. My book will be a combination of channeled messages from the Dark Goddess, my personal memoir, Heroine's journey, and the marriage/symbiosis of the divine masculine and divine feminine working together.</font></p><p><font color=""#6a6a6a"">Who is the Dark Goddess?</font></p><p><font color=""#6a6a6a"">To me, the Dark Goddess is the aspect of creation that most people fear, thus, she is highly ""taboo"", repressed, and projected onto with hate. She is Kali, the Black Madonna, Mary Magdalene, Medusa and the sacred whore. She is the Earth, the soil, the mud, the Soul, the death of lies, the death of what's fake and primmed to look pretty. She is the place from which we form from and the place we dissolve back into when we die. She is ecstatic and orgasmic; she is ultimate desire, the desire that has us longing to live in our purpose and in our aliveness. She is the dance, the unknown, and the vaginal canal to the witchy wise cauldron of feminine mysteries. She is the aspect of creation that is typically called the ""witch"", ""bitch"" or ""whore"" yet, she is desired by everyone and we deeply long for her. She is boundless love...ultimate cosmic compassion!</font></p><p><font color=""#6a6a6a""></font></p><p><font color=""#6a6a6a""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">""The dark goddesses represent the hidden and suppressed archetypal aspects of a woman AND man’s psyche that lives unseen in the shadows of the personality. These dark aspects contain all the characteristics that have been ‘demonized’ by the patriarchal society. It is evident that these aspects are regarded as chaotic and even anarchistic by society, both modern and ancient. In order to know oneself, one needs to intimately know and understand both light and dark aspects. As an authentic being, you are empowered and free to allow both the dark and light aspects of self to alchemize. The alchemical process of transformation needs the initial step of acceptance. Acceptance entails the suspension of the judgement of what is dark and light, or good and bad, or desirable and undesirable. In the alchemical process the polarities or opposites dissolve and a third way of being is born."" -Jalaja Bonheim</span></font></p><p><font color=""#6a6a6a""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">My GOAL, WHY this is important to me and HOW this relates to the larger World:</span></font></p><p><font color=""#6a6a6a""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">My Goal is to write and perform about this ""taboo"" and to speak from her in order to help the ""shadow"" areas of existence become more integrated in the World and thus more BALANCE can occur between the masculine and feminine working in symbiosis. When the shadow is ""disowned"" we act towards it in unconscious ways. In the current world we live in, the masculine energy is oftentimes acting without the balance of, or respect for, the feminine. I personally believe that the magnification of masculine energy and simultaneous disregard of the feminine leads to unconscious grasping, raping, disconnection, corruption, competition, arrogant independence, dominance, over-production and greed.</span></font></p><p><font color=""#6a6a6a""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">In present day society this can be seen in the objectification of women, violence towards gay men, inequality in financial support for jobs related to art, shamanism or right brain vs. jobs related to investment banking, oil or left brain, fear-driven methods of political and religious control, unchecked consumerism, cultural appropriation, spiritual bypassing, racial prejudice, and environmental degradation. This magnification of the ""masculine"" without the balance of the ""feminine"" feeds linear, hierarchical and dichotomous ways of thinking that lead to oppression. This may be why natives to the land as well as male or female bodied people who feel more fully connected to the feminine aspect of creation in terms of life path and/or way of being are also feeling forgotten, unappreciated, degraded, and stripped of resources.</span><br/></font></p><p></p><p><font color=""#6a6a6a"">Why the Mediterranean?</font></p><p><font color=""#6a6a6a"">Since my Soul's path is that of a channel, when I am in a location I can allow my system to merge with the area around me, and I deliver the messages that flow through me in the process. The Mediterranean is rich with our ancestor's history, early civilizations, the Etruscians, early paganism, the black virgins, the Gnostic-Christian underground, the Knights Templar, the crusades, and the protection of the Holy Grail. I am on a quest to uncover lost feminine wisdom and reveal what pours through me in service of the larger collective. This book is meant to inspire the feminine revolution that is already taking place. To shed light on the aspects of duality and collective consciousness that we often avoid, dismiss, rape, grasp, hate or fear. The more we interact with and engage with the repressed aspects of creation, the more we embrace them and are less likely to unconsciously act out towards them.</font></p><h1><font color=""#6a6a6a"">Creative Travel Partner:</font></h1><p><font color=""#6a6a6a"">I am looking for a creative travel partner to share this experience with and co-create something together in service of the larger cause of the feminine revolution.</font></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">If the statements below resonate with you, then you may be my creative travel partner!

My Story:I entered the cocoon of my Soul's journey in August of 2011. I quickly became a cellular soup of dismembered parts not knowing who I was. With the support of my therapist, Somatic Therapy cohort, spiritual practices, and community, I worked with my dismembered parts, shadows, sexuality, anger, power, roles, identities, and insecurities. Transformation began taking place; old parts of me started dying and I began to heal and come into my wholeness. During this time, I connected to my Soul's imagery through dance, expressive arts, body-based awareness, Jungian inquiry, dreamwork, spiritual channeling, and by talking to the creatures that showed up at my doorstep. In June of 2013 while on a vision fast in the wilderness with Animas Valley Institute I emerged from my cocoon and I have not been the same since. I transformed from caterpillar to butterfly...from girl to woman...from being hidden to being seen...and from Julia to Ruby. I have come into my wholeness, my Dharma, and my Soul's purpose. I feel ripe and overflowing, ready to offer what I do to the larger World in service of something much larger than me. I am ready to step into the revolutionary that I am in service of manifesting balance on this planet.My Soul revealed to me, that my purpose is that of a ""channel"". I channel Ancient feminine mysteries through my writing, art, and performance. I am a voice for the unheard voices! I also connect to people at a Soul level and inspire them into their Soul's purpose like a Dharma Doula, and I connect to those who are dying (or have already passed) and need help transitioning into the spirit world as a Death Doula. Please go to www.rubyreveals.com if you would like to learn more about me, my story, my writings, my offerings and my spoken word.Because Channeling is my Soul's purpose and my reason for living...it comes natural to me. I have been ""training"" for lifetimes!Side note: I realize not everyone experiences the safe spaces, opportunities, and privilege to do the kind of work that allows them to live in their purpose. To me, acknowledging my privilege does not mean sitting back in gluttony, greed, and presumed power. To me, acknowledging my privilege means getting my hands dirty, standing up for those whose voices are repressed, and doing something big that changes the World! My Campaign: Through my recent dreams, meditations and channeled messages, I have been given my next task. I am to go to the Mediterranean (the vagina of the World) to connect to the history of the land in relation to the Dark Goddess and channel messages for my next book. My book will be a combination of channeled messages from the Dark Goddess, my personal memoir, Heroine's journey, and the marriage/symbiosis of the divine masculine and divine feminine working together.Who is the Dark Goddess?To me, the Dark Goddess is the aspect of creation that most people fear, thus, she is highly ""taboo"", repressed, and projected onto with hate. She is Kali, the Black Madonna, Mary Magdalene, Medusa and the sacred whore. She is the Earth, the soil, the mud, the Soul, the death of lies, the death of what's fake and primmed to look pretty. She is the place from which we form from and the place we dissolve back into when we die. She is ecstatic and orgasmic; she is ultimate desire, the desire that has us longing to live in our purpose and in our aliveness. She is the dance, the unknown, and the vaginal canal to the witchy wise cauldron of feminine mysteries. She is the aspect of creation that is typically called the ""witch"", ""bitch"" or ""whore"" yet, she is desired by everyone and we deeply long for her. She is boundless love...ultimate cosmic compassion!""The dark goddesses represent the hidden and suppressed archetypal aspects of a woman AND man’s psyche that lives unseen in the shadows of the personality. These dark aspects contain all the characteristics that have been ‘demonized’ by the patriarchal society. It is evident that these aspects are regarded as chaotic and even anarchistic by society, both modern and ancient. In order to know oneself, one needs to intimately know and understand both light and dark aspects. As an authentic being, you are empowered and free to allow both the dark and light aspects of self to alchemize. The alchemical process of transformation needs the initial step of acceptance. Acceptance entails the suspension of the judgement of what is dark and light, or good and bad, or desirable and undesirable. In the alchemical process the polarities or opposites dissolve and a third way of being is born."" -Jalaja BonheimMy GOAL, WHY this is important to me and HOW this relates to the larger World:My Goal is to write and perform about this ""taboo"" and to speak from her in order to help the ""shadow"" areas of existence become more integrated in the World and thus more BALANCE can occur between the masculine and feminine working in symbiosis. When the shadow is ""disowned"" we act towards it in unconscious ways. In the current world we live in, the masculine energy is oftentimes acting without the balance of, or respect for, the feminine. I personally believe that the magnification of masculine energy and simultaneous disregard of the feminine leads to unconscious grasping, raping, disconnection, corruption, competition, arrogant independence, dominance, over-production and greed.In present day society this can be seen in the objectification of women, violence towards gay men, inequality in financial support for jobs related to art, shamanism or right brain vs. jobs related to investment banking, oil or left brain, fear-driven methods of political and religious control, unchecked consumerism, cultural appropriation, spiritual bypassing, racial prejudice, and environmental degradation. This magnification of the ""masculine"" without the balance of the ""feminine"" feeds linear, hierarchical and dichotomous ways of thinking that lead to oppression. This may be why natives to the land as well as male or female bodied people who feel more fully connected to the feminine aspect of creation in terms of life path and/or way of being are also feeling forgotten, unappreciated, degraded, and stripped of resources.Why the Mediterranean?Since my Soul's path is that of a channel, when I am in a location I can allow my system to merge with the area around me, and I deliver the messages that flow through me in the process. The Mediterranean is rich with our ancestor's history, early civilizations, the Etruscians, early paganism, the black virgins, the Gnostic-Christian underground, the Knights Templar, the crusades, and the protection of the Holy Grail. I am on a quest to uncover lost feminine wisdom and reveal what pours through me in service of the larger collective. This book is meant to inspire the feminine revolution that is already taking place. To shed light on the aspects of duality and collective consciousness that we often avoid, dismiss, rape, grasp, hate or fear. The more we interact with and engage with the repressed aspects of creation, the more we embrace them and are less likely to unconsciously act out towards them.Creative Travel Partner:I am looking for a creative travel partner to share this experience with and co-create something together in service of the larger cause of the feminine revolution.If the statements below resonate with you, then you may be my creative travel partner! Contact me at ruby@rubyreveals.com* I am an Earth Guardian.* I feel inspired by this Revolution and want to support balance on this planet.* I have done a great deal of healing work, have come into a place of wholeness, and am living in my Soul's purpose.* I feel inspired to create for a larger cause (film, photography, writing, performance, poetry etc.)* I am creative. I understand artistry and the creative mind. I feel inspired to create something on my own in addition to a co-collaboration with Ruby.* I enjoy the beauty of life and enjoy slower-paced traveling in which I really get to soak in a location and the local way of living.* I am at ease alone AND in relationship. I practice conscious communication and know how to say yes, no, express my needs, and honor my boundaries.* I know how to take personal responsibility for my feelings and needs. In other words, I don't play the Blame/Shame game.* I am attracted to traveling to the Mediterranean. I have been drawn their for my own reasons.* I am honest, playful and responsible.* I don't have any addictions to substances and I'm not a big partier...but that doesn't mean I don't like to dance!Financial Support: Please contribute to this cause! It will help me and my creative partner be big voices for the suppressed voices. It will help us change the World through art.Your contributions will go to both my creative partner and I's plane tickets, food and lodging while we work on our individual and collaborative creative projects.The goal is 23,339. This goal showed up as reasonable when I sat down to calculate plane tickets, lodging and food.If I do not reach my goal, them my creative partner and I will create something in the United States. It may have a different flavor, but it will certainly be for the same cause...this Revolution in BALANCE.Other Support:While reading this campaign...if anything comes to mind around locations to travel to or people you know that may be willing to host us. This kind of support is also greatly welcomed and appreciated!Also, please share this campaign, get the word out, and make some noise! The Impact:You supporting this campaign will help get some momentum going in the Feminine Revolution. It will help catalyze change that supports the reciprocal nature of the divine masculine and divine feminine working in symbiosis. It will honor Kali! It will also help those people around the World whose voices are suppressed and repressed to be heard through the art that my creative partner and I create.When my book is published and I am financially rich...I will certainly pay this forward to continue supporting others in their contributions to this revolution!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Lol i love u </i>is a book about all things online dating—and I don’t just mean dating apps. Today, more than ever, people are finding love online, whether on Tinder, Instagram, Snapchat, etc., and I’m here to tell some hilarious, horrific and hopefully helpful stories that will give you some clarity in your digital search for “the one.” <br/><br/>My name is Isabella Vaccaro and I am the author of <i>Lol i love u</i>. I wrote this book because I found myself thrust into the world of online dating without a clue as to how it worked or, rather, if it really worked at all. Writing this book has opened my eyes to the pitfalls as well as the wonders of the digital love era and how exactly we should navigate it. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to date intentionally online. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I now have for online dating, because I know it can be a source of stress and anxiety. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you view dating apps and online dating with a positive attitude, as well as arm you with examples and specific tips to maximize your time on these apps and make some amazing connections. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about dating apps and how to use them according to dating app CEOs, dating coaches and other experts, and how sometimes too many options can be detrimental to your happiness. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>My own dating app experiment, where I go on a month-long Hinge swiping spree and tell you about the outcomes of my dates.</li>
<li>How two roommates found themselves in a Snapchat-group-turned-gay-dating app as boys from around the east coast attempted to meet people in the Covid-19 pandemic.</li>
<li>The story of two strangers who fell in love on OkCupid and decided to make their own dating app—Curius—to help others date with intention, too.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you feel completely overwhelmed logging onto the seven different dating apps on your iPhone, are looking to find a relationship (or even just a hook-up) in the era of Covid-19 and digital love, or simply can’t get enough juicy gossip on hook-ups gone wrong, ghost-town stories, or catfish disasters. </p>
<p><i>Lol i love u</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to college-aged students or really anyone looking for love online and are running out of interesting ways to say “Hey” to their 800 matches on Tinder, Bumble, Hinge...well, you get the point.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Lol, i love u </h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + Chapters 1 and 2. Chapter 1 will take you on a journey through the dating scripts, starting from the calling era of the 1900s all the way through today’s murky waters of hooking up and running away from labels. And that’s exactly why I am writing this book—to further define this confusing time in the history of dating. In Chapter 2, I put it all on the line and swipe furiously for a month straight, go on dates and tell you all the nitty gritty details of my infamous Hinge Experiment.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains Chapters 3-10. In the bulk of the book, you will learn the best practices for using dating apps, how to transition smoothly from messaging online into a date, the do’s and don’ts of meeting romantic partners on apps like Snapchat and Instagram, how to date with intention, the risks of sexual violence from dating apps and even a phenomenon called “choice burnout,” which can set in after you’ve been swiping a little too much. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains Chapter 11, the conclusion, in which I reflect on my own performance in using the tips in this book and encourage you to get on these apps and make it happen. </p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>The Boroughs is a satirical comedy book about New York City.<br/><br/>My name is Cristian Vargas and I am the author of The Boroughs. I wrote this book because I wanted to write something more down to earth to the experiences of New Yorkers outside of the portrayed dichotomy of the “crime/drug-dealing/trenches” type of New York and “the suburban girl moving to NYC to find herself” type of New York. I wanted to make something reminiscent of my own experiences within the city.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will just...laugh. I wrote this based on a series of skits, some even inspired by true stories. I then turned those skits into a coherent plotline. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with themes of change and how change can be different, bad, good, or indifferent. In all honesty, the deeper you think, the more you’ll get out of this book, but if you just want something surface level funny, then this is the right book for you.<br/><br/>The world is set in a fictional, yet realistic New York where the overarching themes of change, gentrification, politics, class, comedy, and a lil bit of booty, interact with the characters. The Boroughs is a coming of age story imbued with surrealist undertones of- sigh. Man...it’s a comedy exemplifying contemporary NYC culture. It’s wild. It’s bold. It's highly inappropriate at times, but it's New York.<br/><br/>This book follows the rotating perspectives of 4 college students, Abel, Marcus, Jordan, and Alex, as they navigate an everchanging city that seems to be leaving some of them behind. Abel is a comedian from the Bronx that is more than meets the eye. Marcus is a Ivy league college student dealing with the duality of progress and looking back to where he came from. Jordan is a heart on his sleeves kid dealing with an ever changing Brooklyn, unable to find himself within the place which once was so familiar. Alex is a college student activist from Queens who is overzealous in her mission for “justice.” These characters clash to give you a perspective not often seen in the portrayals of New York. Within their rotating perspectives, you’ll catch a glimpse into the crazy world that is The Boroughs.<br/><br/>The Boroughs speaks to the soul of the unheard and those who want to grapple with the existential crises of belonging. You will love this book if you love to live, love, laugh. But seriously, if you grew up watching shows like the Boondocks and love social commentary pieces then you’ll like this.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that The Boroughs, outside of trolling, inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Damn, do we really care about s*** as much as we say we do?</li>
<li>Can we only engage in activism through a lens of aesthetic?</li>
<li>Why can’t I find a job in my own city?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing these questions will make us do absolutely nothing, but at least we tried. </p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Cristian Vargas is a 21-year-old Dominican genius from Brooklyn. Upon being disillusioned by the mundaneness of college and the lack of belonging in his own city, he became passionate in comedic escapism, where “If [He] jokes about everything, then nothing can really harm [him].” This, propelled forth by his desire to anger people, inspired him to write The Boroughs. He hopes to show people a side of NYC that they may not be familiar with and to question our contemporary social tone. In his free time, he likes to apply to “entry level” jobs on LinkedIn in hopes he can find a job to afford the rising rent. For fun, he likes to write skits exemplifying the social zeitgeist of our contemporary times.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Cristian Vargas at imcristianvargas@gmail.com and on IG @imcristianvargas</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Love Story: An Encounter with God</i> is about my experiences of not waiting and waiting until marriage to have sex, and the role that my faith played in the journey towards abstinence.<br/><br/>My name is Mellie Napolitano and I am the author of <i>Love Story: An Encounter with God.</i> I wrote this book to give readers hope that abstinence before marriage is an attainable and worthwhile endeavor.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how abstinence enables you to grow as a person. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to explore a challenging but exciting alternative to the hook-up culture.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of romance, faith, and love through narratives like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How college campus life challenged my beliefs regarding purity;</li>
<li>How physical intimacy, even with a committed partner, led me to feel distant from myself and from God; and,</li>
<li>How the sacrament of reconciliation forced me to be honest with myself and my partner about boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Love Story: An Encounter with God </i>speaks to young adults and their mentors who are grappling with the themes of romance, love, and faith. The book inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is abstinence from sexual activity really possible in today’s hook-up culture?</li>
<li>Why would someone wait until marriage to have sex?</li>
<li>What’s the point in waiting if you are someone who’s not a virgin anymore? </li>

We immediately decided to join forces and start creating 3D prototypes to launch a crowd-funding campaign. We're super excited about making our dream a reality, and thanks to everyone who has supported LegacyPop we've surpassed our goal.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Female Empowered Fashion is about the ways in which fashion promotes female empowerment. This includes how fashion has been used to promote inclusivity in body image, build supportive and educational programs for girls, and show how young women have broken into the industry and gained success. It includes insights, tactics, and solutions from industry CEOs, VPs, stylists, designers, and influencers.<br/><br/>My name is Ariana Dimitrakis and I am the author of Female Empowered Fashion. I wrote this book because these are two topics that I am passionate about. I believe they are relevant and important to society today, so I thought it would be interesting to put them together and see how they are affecting each other.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that the fashion industry does promote female empowerment. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for fashion in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand ways to break into the industry, rise to high-ranking positions, and support the movement to empower girls.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how fashion promotes female empowerment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Women, with or without prior industry knowledge, break into the fashion industry and build successful careers.</li>
<li>Women use their positions in the industry to create scholarships and programs for girls.</li>
<li>From magazines to the runway, the fashion industry promotes inclusivity and body image positivity for girls.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you are a young woman who is interested in fashion and wants to hear the different perspectives and insights on fashion and female empowerment from strong female figures of the industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Female Empowered Fashion</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts....</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1 contains the introduction + an additional chapter. This includes the history of the fashion industry in relation to female empowerment. It touches on how style has changed over time, gender inequality in terms of employment, and how the media has impacted inclusivity.</li>
<li>Part 2 contains Chapters 2-8. This includes insights from women who have broken into the industry and risen to high ranking positions. It also shares stories of women who use their positions to empower young girls through the creation of campaigns, programs, rewards and networking platforms. Additionally, it offers perspectives on gender and body image inclusivity.</li>
<li>Part 3 contains Chapter 9. This reflects on the information in previous chapters and gathers perspectives from sources interviewed to suggest solutions for the fashion industry to promote more girls in the future.<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July, 2020.</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this summer.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook.</p>
<p>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<br/>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish</p>
<ul>
<li>A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</li>

</ul>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Ariana Dimitrakis is a sophomore at Lehigh University majoring in journalism with a double minor in marketing and graphic design. She is the deputy lifestyle editor of Lehigh’s student-run publication, The Brown and White, and the campus editor-at-large from Lehigh for Thrive Global.<br/><br/>I wrote this book because I am passionate about both fashion and female empowerment, and I wanted to explore how they affect each other. Most people believe that fashion hinders female empowerment, but I wanted to highlight all of the ways that fashion is actually promoting it.<br/><br/>My interest in fashion comes from my love for clothes, the fashion design classes I took in high school, and the fashion blog I write in my free time. This industry is one that I aspire to grow a career in, and the different perspectives from female figures analyzed in this book will provide insights to young women with the same goal.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Ariana at arianadimitrakis@gmail.com and arianadimitrakis on Instagram.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<p>Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #FemaleEmpoweredFashion and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so we can help amplify your efforts.</p>
<p>You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page</p>
<p>Please share my book to 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it. Please do this as a text message or Direct Message on social media.</p>

This includes how fashion has been used to promote inclusivity in body image, build supportive and educational programs for girls, and show how young women have broken into the industry and gained success. It includes insights, tactics, and solutions from industry CEOs, VPs, stylists, designers, and influencers.My name is Ariana Dimitrakis and I am the author of Female Empowered Fashion. I wrote this book because these are two topics that I am passionate about. I believe they are relevant and important to society today, so I thought it would be interesting to put them together and see how they are affecting each other.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that the fashion industry does promote female empowerment. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for fashion in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand ways to break into the industry, rise to high-ranking positions, and support the movement to empower girls.In this book, you'll learn about how fashion promotes female empowerment:

Women, with or without prior industry knowledge, break into the fashion industry and build successful careers.
Women use their positions in the industry to create scholarships and programs for girls.
From magazines to the runway, the fashion industry promotes inclusivity and body image positivity for girls.

 
You will love this book if you are a young woman who is interested in fashion and wants to hear the different perspectives and insights on fashion and female empowerment from strong female figures of the industry.
 
The Book - Female Empowered Fashion
The book is written in 3 parts....

Part 1 contains the introduction + an additional chapter. This includes the history of the fashion industry in relation to female empowerment. It touches on how style has changed over time, gender inequality in terms of employment, and how the media has impacted inclusivity.
Part 2 contains Chapters 2-8. This includes insights from women who have broken into the industry and risen to high ranking positions. It also shares stories of women who use their positions to empower young girls through the creation of campaigns, programs, rewards and networking platforms. Additionally, it offers perspectives on gender and body image inclusivity.
Part 3 contains Chapter 9. This reflects on the information in previous chapters and gathers perspectives from sources interviewed to suggest solutions for the fashion industry to promote more girls in the future.

About the Author
Ariana Dimitrakis is a sophomore at Lehigh University majoring in journalism with a double minor in marketing and graphic design. She is the deputy lifestyle editor of Lehigh’s student-run publication, The Brown and White, and the campus editor-at-large from Lehigh for Thrive Global.I wrote this book because I am passionate about both fashion and female empowerment, and I wanted to explore how they affect each other. Most people believe that fashion hinders female empowerment, but I wanted to highlight all of the ways that fashion is actually promoting it.My interest in fashion comes from my love for clothes, the fashion design classes I took in high school, and the fashion blog I write in my free time. This industry is one that I aspire to grow a career in, and the different perspectives from female figures analyzed in this book will provide insights to young women with the same goal.For more information you can connect with Ariana at arianadimitrakis@gmail.com and arianadimitrakis on Instagram.

The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use.

As she is stolen from everything that she knows, she is forced to overcome her own anxiety and learn to become the queen she was meant to be against all odds.<br/><br/>My name is Jaelynn Hart and I am the author of Of Thrones and Thieves. I wrote this book because, as a lesbian woman, I don’t often see myself reflected in the heroes of most stories. For example, in Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, and The Hunger Games, there are these fantastical stories of heroes and heroines — and none of them look like me. Percy falls for Annabeth, Harry has Ginny, and Katniss finds Peeta. I made this book so that, just once, I could be the hero, because I believe representation is important. If I had picked up Harry Potter at eleven years old and Hermione had fallen in love with Luna Lovegood instead of Ron Weasley, I wouldn’t have struggled the way I did with my own identity. So my stories are for the young girls that need to see a hero that looks like them — you’re just as extraordinary as anybody else.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will find yourself between the pages. This is a story about discovering who you are and learning to love yourself along the way. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to escape from a world of prejudice and learn alongside Elara — to find yourself and realize that it doesn’t matter who you love or what you look like. We’re all capable of being the hero in our own stories.<br/><br/>You’ll follow Princess Elara of Metanoia as she is kidnapped on the day of her coronation. Unsure if she is even fit to take over her mother’s place as Queen, Princess Elara finds herself completely in over her head with her new situation as pandemonium breaks out over her castle. She is whisked away from her home and everything she knows, taken aboard a ship of pirates hired to kidnap her by a mysterious third party whose identity is kept a secret. Princess Elara is unwilling to admit defeat, however, and will do whatever she can to escape her captors, even if it means battling the pirate captain, Kai, herself. As tensions rise, it becomes clear to Elara that these pirates aren’t what they seem to be; their secrets are hidden behind tight lips, and the princess finds herself drawn to their mystery — especially that of Captain Kai. As answers force their way to the surface, Elara realizes she must choose between two sides — will she hold loyalty to her kingdom, or will she be drawn in by the sudden, surprising freedom she’s been granted as a prisoner?<br/><br/>You will love this book if you love enemies-to-lovers stories, enjoy fantasy fiction about pirates, or want to see strong heroines conquer their stories. Of Thrones and Thieves speaks to the LGBT+ community and women who want to grapple with strong heroines and lesbian romances in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Of Thrones and Thieves inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>
<li>Why do so many LGBT+ fiction books focus on coming out, rather than on us as people?</li>
<li>How does familial pressure affect your ability to believe in yourself and your position?</li>
<li>Is it easier to find yourself when you’re surrounded by people similar to you?</li>
</ul><p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.

On the day of her coronation, pandemonium breaks out in Metanoia and Princess Elara is kidnapped by a band of pirates. The finale of part 1 is where we meet her companion, Captain Kai.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 4-9. Here, we see Princess Elara struggling with life on the pirate ship. She is trying to find answers and a way to escape, but to no avail. Here, she makes a few alliances.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 10-13. In this part, the princess is finally starting to get her sea legs and has found her place among the crew when disaster strikes that sweeps her feet out from under her.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> contains chapters 14-18.

I've produced a previous children's book so I have some experience.
I've been working in a creative field for over 15 years. So I got thick skin.
Sticking to a strict(ish) schedule will help with the time aspect.

<h2>The Story of My Book</h2>
<p><br/>Return to Pō is a series of essays about my young adult life in Hawaiʻi. I left the familiar home of my upbringing behind to confront a innate desire to explore the source of life and its purpose. This brought me to Hawaiʻi, one of the remotest places on Earth, and even beyond to the uninhabited island of Kure Atoll. This is a coming-of-age story, a collection of personal essays weaved together to unravel some of humanity's greatest questions: Who are we? Where did we come from? And where are we going?<br/><br/>My name is Jon-Erik Jardine and I am the author of Return to Pō. I was compelled to write this book because throughout my life I have been sensing a kind of crisis of meaning in our modern world. I have become concerned about the growing disconnect between people and nature and spiritual malnourishment. In a secularizing world where our relationship to each other and the world is occuring more and more through technological interface, we are losing the embodied experience of who we are and what we are.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the connection we as humans share with nature, and what this connection can teach us about being human. To be human is to observe the universe both within and without, unbound by the limitations of a singular point of view. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to dive deeper into topics on death, personal identity, adulthood, and social responsibility, and how what truly informs us about these topics can be found in a more-than-human world.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of Rites of Passage and environmentalism through narratives like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Departure and Arrivals</strong> - A shrinking team faces a growing problem when a heatwave strikes on a tiny wildlife refuge in the middle of the pacific ocean.</li>
<li>
<strong>Death of Our Lives</strong> - An attempt to introduce a population of endangered ducks faces unforeseen challenges that illuminates how precious life is.</li>
<li>
<strong>Answering the Call</strong> - When death hits and we slip out of the world, how do we return to the living? In this essay, I face the greatest challenge of my life, realizing everything I have learned has prepared me for this moment.</li>
</ul>
<br/>You will love this book if you are:<ul>
<li>fascinated by the natural world and your place in it.</li>
<li>interested in the permeability of identity and the path toward becoming one’s own self.</li>
<li>interested in what it is like to live on an uninhabited island with six other people for half year at a time, and what effect this can have on a person’s perspective of humans and the world at large.</li>
</ul>
<br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Return to Pō</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>What does it mean to mature into a true adult?</li>
<li>What can we learn about our role in society from an other-than-human world?</li>
<li>What can we learn about the modern world from an ancient past?</li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing what a connection to nature has to do with our relationship and responsibility to the world will change us all for the better.</p>

<p>i have had the misfortune of meeting and welcoming into my life individuals that wrote my relationship guidebook for me. this guidebook was full of all the things relationships should never be; abuse, rape, confinement, and isolation. it wasn’t written all at once. one person wrote a chapter and months later the next chapter was written by another. so on and so on until the pages were full and i couldn’t find my way out. i began to think that this was the normality of relationships and without a thriving relationship to look up to, i actively sought out people who would continue this pattern of learned behavior.</p>
<p>that was until i reconnected with the person i’d been in love with since the day i met him. through him i began to rewrite my guidebook. i began to understand what i learned as normal was neither normal nor acceptable. i began to recognize what it was to be respected, trusted, seen, and loved.</p>
<p>while he fostered this growth and change within me, he couldn’t see any of the good and beauty in himself. i set out to write this book not only as my confession to him of my past and my feelings for him, but to remind him how amazing and exquisite he is and how beneficially he impacts all those whom his light touches.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Jan Kotouč. I am an author of thirteen novels published in the Czech Republic by Fantom Print and Brokilon. My genre is sci-fi and also alternate history. Several of my books have become bestsellers and won several awards.</p>
<p>I am a fairly successful and established author in the Czech Republic, but I have decided to expand and move to the English-speaking market. I have hired a translator and with the blessing of my publishers, my novels will be available in both printed and electronic versions.</p>
<p>And here is where I need your help. I need your help raising money to translate my books into English. I already have a very talented translator who I work with, but I need your support.</p>
<p>You might – rightfully – ask yourself why support an author like me since there are dime a dozen sci-fi authors out there. That’s a very good question.   I have attached the first few chapters from my novel in a link at the bottom of this page, so you can look at them and see if you like my novel . Another reason to support me is that one of the rewards is the option to include you in my novel. Would you like to have a character named after yourself? No problem. Is a character too small for you? How about a planet named in your honor?Or a big corporation, or a ship? Or, you can have a whole novel dedicated to you.</p>
<p>Thank you and I have complete trust in you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>What will happen if you don’t collect all the money?</strong></p>
<p>I will still be able to pay some of the expenses and I’ll give rewards to everyone who’s donated. That’s why I’ve chosen Indiegogo. I will still give all perks to the backers.</p>
<p><strong>Isn’t the target amount too small?</strong></p>
<p>It probably is, then again, I’m also financing the translation partially myself, it would not seem fair to ask only for your contribution and be unwilling to contribute anything myself.</p>
<p><strong>What will happen if you’ll collect more money than the target amount?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on how much more it’d be. Depending on the amount, I can give extra goals, like hiring an extra translator to start working on another series of mine.</p>
<p><strong>Why hire a translator? Can’t you translate it yourself?</strong></p>
<p>I probably can, I’ve translated several shorter works of mine. But I am also a professional writer, I need to write new stories, not only because I can then publish them, but because that’s my passion. If I were to translate it, it would take away from the time I could use to write instead.</p>
<p><strong>If I get a character named after me, how will it be included in the book since you are translating a book that is already finished and published in different language?</strong></p>
<p>I constantly write new books and there’ll always be room for names. Also every book of mine has many secondary and tertiary characters and it’s no problem to change some of the names in a different language edition. Translators often change names of characters and places if they have some special meaning in a given language. This is similar.</p>
<p><strong>Is Czech sci-fi different from the mainstream English-language sci-fi?</strong></p>
<p>I think every author is different and has a different approach to things. But in the end, every story is about people and that’s universal. I don’t consider myself to be a Czech writer, I consider myself to be a science fiction writer.Or just a writer.</p>
<p><strong>Is publishing online through Amazon better than traditional publishing?</strong></p>
<p>It’s not mutually exclusive, many successful writers have traditional publishers and have their older out-of-print books up on Amazon. Or they‘ve started on Amazon and then been picked up by traditional publishers. Once you have the text in English, the sky is the limit.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think your books can make it through as an „indie“?</strong></p>
<p>The hard truth is that 99 % of all independent books published on Amazon are not successful and they sell a few dozen copies.</p>
<p>My advantage is that I’m not a newbie. I’ve written thirteen novels, plus many novellas and short stories on the Czech market with traditional publishers Brokilon and Fantom Print (who also publish Czech editions of books by Jack Campbell, Larry Correia, Marko Kloos, Robert Jordan, Patricia Briggs or John Ringo).

<p><strong>Justificación:</strong></p>
<p>Recientemente, el Gobierno Peruano publicó el Decreto Supremo 006-2013-IN (Sábado 13 de Abril de 2013), que reglamenta la ley No. 29954 publicada el 4 de Diciembre del 2012 a través del cual se norma la fabricación, comercio, posesión y uso por particulares de armas y municiones que no son de guerra.  La Asociación Peruana de Propietarios Legales de Armas de Fuego (APPLAF) ha hecho conocer su más enérgico rechazo a esta inconstitucional medida y lidera un esfuerzo, junto a otras organizaciones y asociaciones de tiro deportivo y caza del Perú, para impedir que las medidas que se describen en esta normativa se hagan efectivas.</p>
<p>En resumen, la normativa hace dificilísimo que los ciudadanos puedan adquirir armas legalmente, a la vez que disuade a los que tienen licencias de renovarlas, arrojándolos a la informalidad (Rospigliosi 2013). Adicionalmente:</p>
<ul>
<li>Se reduce la vigencia de las licencias de uso de armas de cinco a un año calendario.</li>
<li>Se reduce a 2 armas por persona para defensa personal, 2 armas por persona para deporte (2 por modalidad) y  2 armas por persona para caza.</li>
<li>Se prohíbe el uso de armas de calibre 9 mm Luger o Parabellum, obligando a transferirlos a miembros de las Fuerzas Armadas y Policía Nacional en actividad, en un plazo de 180 días calendario, debiendo entregar a la SUCAMEC sus armas en custodia hasta la transferencia. (Castañeda 2013).</li>
</ul><p>El gobierno con un mero DS, atenta contra el derecho a la PROPIEDAD, consagrado por nuestra Constitución; el gobierno quiere obligar a muchos ciudadanos peruanos, propietarios de armas legales, con licencias vigentes emitidas por la anterior DICSCAMEC que certifican su propiedad, a vender sus bienes en un plazo de 180 días; incluso en el caso de pistolas calibre 9mm Luger o PB, sólo se pueden transferir a miembros de las fuerzas armadas o policiales en actividad. y mientras se venden, el gobierno quiere que entreguemos nuestras armas a la SUCAMEC para que las guarden en “custodia”, cuando es conocido que armas depositadas en estos almacenes, se pierden, les cambian piezas o acaban en manos de delincuentes.</p>
<p>El Gobierno Peruano está vulnerando el principio de la seguridad jurídica al pretender desconocer y anular licencias legalmente emitidas con anterioridad a este absurdo DS. La supuesta obligación de venderles las pistolas 9mm Luger solo a miembros de las fuerzas armadas o policiales, vulnera la libertad de contratar, al obligar a algunos usuarios legales a vender su propiedad a un reducido grupo, a precios que por la necesidad, podrían ser irrisorios.</p>
<p>El gobierno con un simple DS atenta contra el derecho a la igualdad ante la ley, pues ahora obtener una licencia, se debe justificar documentariamente la necesidad de su obtención; es decir, nosotros debemos de documentar que el gobierno es incapaz de defender a sus ciudadanos y por eso necesitamos un arma de defensa. También debemos documentar la necesidad de practicar cualquier deporte de tiro, o la necesidad de practicar la caza deportiva. Personas de bajos recursos, que no pueden documentar estas necesidades, son discriminadas por esta nueva ley y su reglamento.</p>
<p>El gobierno con este DS ha incluido como armas (y por lo tanto hay que tramitar licencias) las neumáticas y las eléctricas. Las carabinas de aire comprimido y los aparatos de shock eléctrico, ahora para ser legales, deben de tener licencia, lo que implica sacar certificados de antecedentes penales, judiciales y policiales, certificado de salud mental (que ahora no solo será psicológico sino también psiquiátrico, y solo será emitido por centros de salud públicos) y perder horas en el engorroso y complicado trámite en la SUCAMEC.  </p>
<p>¿Dónde adquieren los delincuentes sus armas para sus fechorías? ¿de dónde sacan fusiles AKM, FAL, granadas, pistolas y chalecos antibalas? del mercado negro,  el cual se abastece con armas de contrabando, con armas producto de delitos, armas no registradas, armas alquiladas o vendidas por algunos malos miembros de la Policía Nacional y Fuerzas Armadas (Castañeda 2013).</p>
<p>¿Será que el objetivo es otro, inconfesable  por lo que esconde, como viene ocurriendo en Venezuela, Ecuador y Argentina? ¿No será que el verdadero propósito es desarmar a la población civil pensante, digna, democrática y cumplidora de la ley? (Couturier 2013)</p>
<p><strong>¿Qué es APPLAF?</strong></p>
<p>APPLAF es una asociación sin fines de lucro establecida el 17 de Enero, 2012 y registrada en los Registros Públicos de Lima Asiento No. 12820437 cuyos principales objetivos son promover la Educación en el uso Correcto, Legal, Seguro y Responsable de las armas de fuego de uso civil; abogar por una legislación favorable que preserve el derecho a la propiedad; y vigilar y de ser posible participar activamente en los procesos judiciales que se deriven del uso legítimo de armas de fuego para salvaguardar la garantía del debido proceso.</p>

El gobierno con un mero DS, atenta contra el derecho a la PROPIEDAD, consagrado por nuestra Constitución; el gobierno quiere obligar a muchos ciudadanos peruanos, propietarios de armas legales, con licencias vigentes emitidas por la anterior DICSCAMEC que certifican su propiedad, a vender sus bienes en un plazo de 180 días; incluso en el caso de pistolas calibre 9mm Luger o PB, sólo se pueden transferir a miembros de las fuerzas armadas o policiales en actividad. y mientras se venden, el gobierno quiere que entreguemos nuestras armas a la SUCAMEC para que las guarden en “custodia”, cuando es conocido que armas depositadas en estos almacenes, se pierden, les cambian piezas o acaban en manos de delincuentes.
El Gobierno Peruano está vulnerando el principio de la seguridad jurídica al pretender desconocer y anular licencias legalmente emitidas con anterioridad a este absurdo DS. La supuesta obligación de venderles las pistolas 9mm Luger solo a miembros de las fuerzas armadas o policiales, vulnera la libertad de contratar, al obligar a algunos usuarios legales a vender su propiedad a un reducido grupo, a precios que por la necesidad, podrían ser irrisorios.
El gobierno con un simple DS atenta contra el derecho a la igualdad ante la ley, pues ahora obtener una licencia, se debe justificar documentariamente la necesidad de su obtención; es decir, nosotros debemos de documentar que el gobierno es incapaz de defender a sus ciudadanos y por eso necesitamos un arma de defensa. También debemos documentar la necesidad de practicar cualquier deporte de tiro, o la necesidad de practicar la caza deportiva. Personas de bajos recursos, que no pueden documentar estas necesidades, son discriminadas por esta nueva ley y su reglamento.
El gobierno con este DS ha incluido como armas (y por lo tanto hay que tramitar licencias) las neumáticas y las eléctricas. Las carabinas de aire comprimido y los aparatos de shock eléctrico, ahora para ser legales, deben de tener licencia, lo que implica sacar certificados de antecedentes penales, judiciales y policiales, certificado de salud mental (que ahora no solo será psicológico sino también psiquiátrico, y solo será emitido por centros de salud públicos) y perder horas en el engorroso y complicado trámite en la SUCAMEC.  
¿Dónde adquieren los delincuentes sus armas para sus fechorías? ¿de dónde sacan fusiles AKM, FAL, granadas, pistolas y chalecos antibalas? del mercado negro,  el cual se abastece con armas de contrabando, con armas producto de delitos, armas no registradas, armas alquiladas o vendidas por algunos malos miembros de la Policía Nacional y Fuerzas Armadas (Castañeda 2013).
¿Será que el objetivo es otro, inconfesable  por lo que esconde, como viene ocurriendo en Venezuela, Ecuador y Argentina? ¿No será que el verdadero propósito es desarmar a la población civil pensante, digna, democrática y cumplidora de la ley? (Couturier 2013)

<p>We are a team of ""freedom-lovers"" passionate about travelling to Burma, the heart of this radical transition. Our intention is to document the insights and stories of the less known leaders in their long march toward freedom: former political prisoners; dissident writers, musicians, journalists, filmmakers, poets and comedians; Buddhist monks and nuns; reformed government leaders; shop owners; returning refugees; farmers; students; and possibly Aung San Suu Kyi herself, along with her esteemed colleagues, mentors and teachers.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 240px;"">The Why?</h2>
<p align=""center""><strong>Aung San Suu Kyi's message has been consistent from the time she entered politics: “Be free. Nobody can imprison your mind. They can imprison your body, but they cannot imprison your mind. We must always remember this. Free your mind.”</strong></p>
<p>But how? How have the people done this for the past 24 years of revolution? That is precisely what we want to ask these courageous activists and more, and in so doing, bring their voices of freedom out from Burma into the world.</p>
<p>These revolutionary voices - the many expressions of the strength and effectiveness of nonviolent strategy - are a GIFT to us all and will support  the struggles for freedom going on in so many other places in the world today, and in our own hearts and minds as well. </p>

<h2 style=""margin-left: 240px;"">The Impact</h2>
<p><em>The (New) Voice of Hope </em>will not only carry Aung San Suu Kyi's illuminated vision, in which politics and spirituality are inseparable, it will for the first time bring forth the courageous stories of many other freedom fighters from over two decades of nonviolent resistance.

<p>This PROJECT is in solidarity with the Occupy movements, the Arab Spring, the student strikes, the immolations in Tibet, and austerity demonstrations the world over.

<h3>Second Tier Goal: $35,000 </h3>
<p>Alan spent six months in Burma in 1995 when producing the original edition of “The Voice of Hope.” The initial $25,000 is just the beginning of this project, covering the most basic costs of a 28 day stay in Burma. In other words, every dollar received beyond $25,000 grants us the privilege of continuing to document as many Voices of Freedom as possible. Thus preserving the priceless insights on nonviolent revolution from some of the most courageous activists alive.    </p>
<p>In addition, we need several full time professionals to transcribe the interviews and a couple of great audio/ video editors. In addition, we need a talented web developer and graphic artist.

<h3><strong>Third Tier Stretch Funding: $50,000 + </strong></h3>

Burma (called Myanmar, by some) is undergoing one of the most epic reforms in human history: after decades of authoritarian military rule we're seeing the dawn of a compassion-inspired democracy born from love and nonviolence.  
This next phase of Burma’s ""revolution of the spirit"" is  being led by former political prisoners, artists and dissidents, including Nobel Peace laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, “an icon of democracy...all around the world,” as declared by President Barack Obama during his historic visit to Burma just days after his reelection.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>The Silver Lining</i> is an intersection of sexual assault and anxiety in the world of gymnastics.  I venture through the intricacies of the silver medal, the silver between the black and white of life and best of all, the silver lining. I explore how the culture influenced my experiences both inside and outside of the gym's four walls. I welcome you into my most intimate stories and invite you to follow me on my journey of discovering my silver lining, in the hopes that I can help you find your silver lining too.<br/><br/>My name is Serena Pergola, and I am the author of <i>The Silver Lining</i>. I wrote this book to share my story with the world and inspire others to share their stories. I want to build a community of support and empowerment.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your silver lining, just like I have. In this book, I want to instill the same passion for sexual assault awareness and prevention, as well as, mental health awareness in you that I have within myself. And ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you find your silver lining.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about trust and empowerment through stories such as:<ul>
<li>I’m Cured! Oh Wait, There’s No Such Thing</li>
<li>The Jagged Path Of Coping And Healing In The Wide World Of Therapy</li>
<li>In a World Where You Can Be Anything, Be Kind</li>
</ul> I want to share this journey with anyone and everyone who is willing to open themselves up to letting me in. I specifically want to connect with those young gymnasts and parents of gymnasts who share my passion for the invaluable sport of gymnastics. The Silver Lining is a non-fiction book that speaks to athletes and parents who are looking at sexual assault and mental health.<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - The Silver Lining</h2>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts:<br/><br/>Part One: Looking Backward contains the Introduction, Prologue and Chapters 1 through 10. These chapters narratively set-up my story and explore how gymnastics inside the four walls of the gym sculpted my life. I then delve into how those vulnerabilities led to the three counts of sexual assault I experienced. This section includes How My First Love Became My Undying Addiction and The Break That Changed My Life.<br/><br/>Part Two: Looking Deeper contains Chapters 11 through 17. In these chapters I take a step back to analyze how these vulnerabilities have affected me on a deeper level outside of the gym. I talk about my journey of finding a therapist that was right for me and coping with my experiences in order to uncover them in a new light. This section includes How a Manipulative Doctor and an Inspiring Patient Helped Me Share My Story and We’ve Only Just Scratched the Surface.<br/><br/>Part Three: Looking Forward contains Chapters 18 through 21. This last section brings everything full circle and discusses how to truly and fully identify and embrace your silver lining. This section includes A Letter From My Mom: Open Your Hearts... And Your Ears and Love Yourself and the Others Will Follow.</p>

<p><i>Last Flight Home</i> is a fantasy novel, the
first in a trilogy set on a planet called<em> Axis Solan.</em></p>
<p><em> T</em><em>he
Austringers </em>are falcon-worshipping mountain dwellers who live just
fine in their secluded world atop some pretty tall cliffs. Their world is being threatened, however — first by their
dying sun and second by an invading force from the north whose land is no
longer habitable. <br/></p>
<p><i>Last Flight Home </i>is the story of a warrior prince who must race home to warn the king — his father — of a treasonous plot and an imminent attack from their displaced northern
enemy. But he faces numerous obstacles along the way, including the threat of a menacing
troll-like character that’s caught right in the middle of everything.  <br/></p>
<p><strong>Who’s the audience?</strong></p>
<p>This novel can appeal to anyone who loves a good old-fashioned
fantasy yarn. It’s filled with action and adventure, a bit of horror, epic battles,
and a scary, demented hill-giant who can morph into various creatures and loves
to drink the blood of his victims.</p>
<p>What more could you want from a fantasy story?  </p>
<p>The story’s main action is a direct result of natural
disasters that force two societies to be at odds with each other. For the main
character, it’s also a coming-of-age story. <br/></p>
<p>The
audience ranges from those who like a good <em><span>man
vs. nature </span></em>story to those who like to see an unlikely hero come
out on top. Among the novel's themes is the notion of
bullying. I’ve created a band of characters who — due to their young age and
lack of physical strength — are overlooked by the corrupt powers-that-be. <br/></p>
<p>These
young people are strong due to their ability to use their brains as much as, if
not more than, their brawn. Despite not being the best of warriors, they still
find their place in defending their people and culture from the invading forces. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I wanted to create a hero who survives mostly by his wits
and brains — and the help of like-minded friends — and explore the notion that
the mind is more powerful than the sword.</p>
<p><strong>Why the campaign?</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.possibilitiespublishingcompany.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Possibilities Publishing Company</a> will release my book in
2015. I am raising money to help supplement the production costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Artwork </b>for the cover and a map of Axis Solan. </li>
<li>
<b>Professional editing.</b> Having a book professionally edited is essential to its success. My publisher requires professional editing before it will publish a book, but it's also the only way to make sure my book is as strong as it can be. </li>
<li>
<b>Marketing. </b>Although there are a lot of free or low-cost ways to market (social media, for example), many activities cost money, including attending conferences and festivals, upgrading the video trailer, creating signs and other marketing materials for those events, and buying book stock to sell at events. </li>
</ul>
<p>I plan to use any extra money I might generate to visit
libraries and schools around the country and host readings, performances and
Q&amp;As about the novel. I would love it if young readers find my novel
interesting and entertaining, especially if it keeps them reading. </p>
<p>If this book launch is successful, the revenue from its sales will enable me to cover the costs of producing the second book and then the third book in the trilogy. So by supporting this campaign, you are making an investment in me and my work and helping me get started on a new and fulfilling path. </p>

first in a trilogy set on a planet called Axis Solan.
 The
Austringers are falcon-worshipping mountain dwellers who live just
fine in their secluded world atop some pretty tall cliffs. Their world is being threatened, however — first by their
dying sun and second by an invading force from the north whose land is no
longer habitable. 
Last Flight Home is the story of a warrior prince who must race home to warn the king — his father — of a treasonous plot and an imminent attack from their displaced northern
enemy. But he faces numerous obstacles along the way, including the threat of a menacing
troll-like character that’s caught right in the middle of everything.  
Who’s the audience?
This novel can appeal to anyone who loves a good old-fashioned
fantasy yarn. It’s filled with action and adventure, a bit of horror, epic battles,
and a scary, demented hill-giant who can morph into various creatures and loves
to drink the blood of his victims.
What more could you want from a fantasy story?  
The story’s main action is a direct result of natural
disasters that force two societies to be at odds with each other. For the main
character, it’s also a coming-of-age story. 
The
audience ranges from those who like a good man
vs. nature story to those who like to see an unlikely hero come
out on top. Among the novel's themes is the notion of
bullying. I’ve created a band of characters who — due to their young age and
lack of physical strength — are overlooked by the corrupt powers-that-be. 
These
young people are strong due to their ability to use their brains as much as, if
not more than, their brawn. Despite not being the best of warriors, they still
find their place in defending their people and culture from the invading forces. 


I wanted to create a hero who survives mostly by his wits
and brains — and the help of like-minded friends — and explore the notion that
the mind is more powerful than the sword.
Why the campaign?
Possibilities Publishing Company will release my book in
2015. I am raising money to help supplement the production costs:


Artwork for the cover and a map of Axis Solan. 

Professional editing. Having a book professionally edited is essential to its success. My publisher requires professional editing before it will publish a book, but it's also the only way to make sure my book is as strong as it can be. 

Marketing. Although there are a lot of free or low-cost ways to market (social media, for example), many activities cost money, including attending conferences and festivals, upgrading the video trailer, creating signs and other marketing materials for those events, and buying book stock to sell at events. 

I plan to use any extra money I might generate to visit
libraries and schools around the country and host readings, performances and
Q&As about the novel. I would love it if young readers find my novel
interesting and entertaining, especially if it keeps them reading. 
If this book launch is successful, the revenue from its sales will enable me to cover the costs of producing the second book and then the third book in the trilogy. So by supporting this campaign, you are making an investment in me and my work and helping me get started on a new and fulfilling path. 
   

Risks and rewards
For every writer who makes a profit from his or her book, there are hundreds of equally talented writers who don't make a cent of profit. The fact that I'm planning a trilogy increases the odds that I'll be profitable because series typically do better than individual books, and the final book in a trilogy is often the best seller that then spurs sales of the first two books. 
I also have some advantages over self-published or subsidy-published authors. First and foremost, I have an innovative, flexible and passionate publishing company supporting me. Aside from expert guidance and advice, it has additional marketing platforms and tools that will expand my reach.

My campaign is quite straightforward - write a non-fiction book on the life of Shemp Howard, one of the original Three Stooges but sadly remembered as the Forgotten Stooge. Through research and contacts with his remaining friends and family members, I will look at his career in the early days, before, during and after his stint(s) with the trio.  He was an innovator and responsible for many of the trio's trademark moves and in addition billed himself as 'the ugliest man in Hollywood.' That last strange description made him a much sought after commodity in the business. Shemp is apparently also Jeopardy's Alex Trebek's favorite Stooge. I will need about $2,500, none of which will cover my expense in terms of time spent researching and writing. Firstly there is a copyright license to be purchased from C3 Entertainment Inc. in Los Angeles. I bought one for a fiction I wrote about Larry Fine - it imagines him winning the junior lightweight boxing championship of the world, weeks before the Great Depression hits. In addition there will likely be some travel to do research and possibly acquire materials, photos for the book.The perks, again quite simple: the joy of reading a book on the life of a man few know anything of - a vaudevillian who helped transform comedy in the early 20th Century and a pioneer in entertainment. More tangible perks - I will attempt to get a reduced rate of purchase for supporters - whether the book is published or self-published.  If I don't reach my goal, I will make up the difference with my own funds. Your contribution will make it possible to pass the first step - acquiring the necessary license. Beyond that, it will allow me to spend the needed time on the project, which I hope to finish writing in a year. If there is enough funding, it will go to a professional editor. In the end I hope my book will fill a gap - provide people interested in popular culture with a slice of real history. I've been a writer for nearly 40 years and this project is a genuine passion. With your help, I can get started. Many thanks in advance for your time and consideration. - Geoff</p><p><br/></p></div>","My name is Geoff Dale, a writer based in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada.

ConlaOrejaRoja nace de la necesidad de una ventana a la opinión, que le permitiera a otras personas con unos puntos de vistas igualmente válidos salir al debate público y contribuir con sus argumentos o hipótesis a la construcción de una sociedad más crítica, que analiza y cuestiona lo que otros callan. Surgimos ante la necesidad de un espacio para la promoción del respeto por el otro y la diferencia, porque aquí no nos interesa cual es la ideología del columnista, sino que tenga el derecho a expresar sus ideas y entienda que podemos convivir con la diferencia si tenemos una actitud tolerante, incluyente y pluralista.Ha sido un primer año donde han escrito más de 300 columnistas de distintas partes de Colombia y el mundo (España, Argentina, México, Estados Unidos, Venezuela, Canadá, etc) Aportando su visión a una discusión abierta que nos ha llenado de experiencias gratificantes, conocimientos nuevos y aprendizajes que hemos ido aplicando al mejoramiento continuo de este medio, de este vehículo para potenciar la libertad de expresión.También realizamos en alianza con distintas instituciones Conversatorios ConlaOrejaRoja, eventos para el encuentro de la sociedad con los expertos donde generamos discusiones tales como: “¿Estaría preparada Colombia para el posconflicto?“, “¿Cómo se está haciendo Periodismo de opinión en Colombia?”, “¿Ser madre es un impedimento para educarse?”. Eventos que nos han permitido sostener de algún modo los gastos que devienen de un proyecto como estos.   Sin embargo, el crecimiento de nuestro flujo y el incremento de los lectores (más de medio millón de usuarios único al mes) han generado la necesidad de implementar distintas mejoras tanto en la página web (pago de un servidor dedicado que permita mayor estabilidad y mejor respuesta, diseño de site a medida, implementación de mejoras en la experiencia de usuario) como en los implementos de trabajo (adecuación de oficina).De igual modo, nuestro objetivo también es poder recompensar a los columnistas que han confiado sus textos en nuestra iniciativa, convencidos de que una sociedad más crítica se logra a través de una libertad de expresión realmente libre, donde nadie estorbe por ser de esta o aquella ideología, por pensar una cosa o criticar otra; y  a todo el equipo de trabajo (director, dos editores, relacionista público, diseñadora y community manager) que día a día trabajan en este proyecto porque creen en su causa, sin esperar nada a cambio.Para todo esto necesitamos tu colaboración, no importa que tan grande sea el monto que puedes donar, sino la intención de contribuir y valorar lo que hacemos como un producto valioso y que merece continuidad en el tiempo.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This indiegogo fundraiser would help raise enough money to pay for a full campaign with Jack Jones Literary Arts. The indiegogo goal is the exact cost of a full campaign. If this fundraiser does not reach its goal, Aisha will hire JJLA for a limited campaign ($5,000) and any extra money raised beyond that will go toward book design for the book's cover and interior by the fabulous Sarah Gzemski. If there are still extra funds she will try to embark on a book tour.</p>

<h2><strong>PERKS</strong></h2>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>We all know that funding for the arts in this country isn't what it should be, and it's getting worse. But we <strong><i>do</i></strong> have each other. And through campaigns like this we can do some of the work to support one another that our institutions can't or won't-- knowing we'll be supported the next time. Because that's what community does.</p>

</div></div>","Support a Writer of Color in this ABSURD CULTURAL MOMENT
 
When it comes to promoting books by writers of color, publicity is both a necessity and an art. If this campaign succeeds, Aisha will be able to hire Jack Jones Literary Arts for a full campaign. By contributing, you won't just be helping to bring Aisha's work to more readers, you'll be supporting a literary initiative that aims to bring more women of color to the forefront of the literary world.
Kima Jones' Jack Jones Literary Arts has successfully helped authors of color (Khadijah Queen, Tyehimba Jess, and Desiree Cooper, among others) play a more powerful role in our cultural conversations. 
ABOUT AISHA 


Dreaming of Ramadi in Detroit was chosen by Maggie Nelson as the winner of the 1913 Open Prose Contest. Aisha's first book, The Fluency of Light: Coming of Age in a Theater of Black and White was deemed ""One of the most original, startling memoirs I have seen in the past ten years"" by Dinty W. Moore. Fanny Howe called it ""a very valuable contribution to the literature of mixed race identity in America."" Aisha is a contributing editor for Guernica: A Magazine of Art and Politics and a staff writer for Autostraddle. Read more of her work here.
ABOUT KIMA 

Author and publicist Kima Jones began Jack Jones Literary Arts in 2015. She works with big presses and small presses, but says, ""I prefer to publicize books that don’t have a big engine behind them even though they deserve the big engine. I want to see those books win."" To see and hear more of Kima's good work and to ENJOY yourself because SHE'S WICKED SHARP AND HILARIOUS, read about her on NPR's Code Switch blog; read this tiny interview on Cosmo Avenue; read this interview or watch this C-SPAN video about Jesmyn Ward's anthology The Fire This Time which includes one of Kima's essays; or read this or this or this. Know that two of the authors up for a PEN award this year work with Kima. 

 
What I Need & What You Get
This indiegogo fundraiser would help raise enough money to pay for a full campaign with Jack Jones Literary Arts. The indiegogo goal is the exact cost of a full campaign. If this fundraiser does not reach its goal, Aisha will hire JJLA for a limited campaign ($5,000) and any extra money raised beyond that will go toward book design for the book's cover and interior by the fabulous Sarah Gzemski. If there are still extra funds she will try to embark on a book tour.
 
PERKS
The perks for this campaign are flat out magic. Friends and family have donated an abundance of arty things that collectively exceed the value of this fundraiser. Here is a glimpse of some of what's on offer:
 
Photography
Matted Photographs of Cultural Icons from the Archives of Former Newsweek Photojournalist Lester Sloan:

Impact
We all know that funding for the arts in this country isn't what it should be, and it's getting worse. But we do have each other. And through campaigns like this we can do some of the work to support one another that our institutions can't or won't-- knowing we'll be supported the next time. Because that's what community does.
Other Ways You Can Help
Tell your friends! Share this indiegogo on social media. Take a look at the perks and tell a friend if you think something might float their boat. Like, do you know someone who needs a huge print of Marvin Gaye on their wall? I hope so.

<p>Hi Friends! I'm Marissa Nofer and writing has been my lifelong passion.  After losing a loved one, I realized that we never know how long we truly have to accomplish our goals in life. I spent a little over a year researching and planning before launching my publishing career in 2019. I have three books coming out this year (June, August, November), and plans for three in 2020 as well.  Royalties from my first three books will not be seen until much later in 2019, and by that time there will be no slots left to commission covers for my 2020 books. </p>

<p><span><strong>(not so) Short Summary</strong></span></p>
<p><span>My name is Sarah Corbett &amp; I've been an activist for most of my life. </span>From squatting in houses targeted for demolition as a 5 year old, to being employed by international charities to reduce global poverty, activism has always been what I do. But 3 years ago I had a crisis. I was burnt out. I'd lost my energy, hope and optimism as an activist. I couldn't go on doing the same things in a rut. Plus I'd just got into cross-stitch (as you do!) and thats when I found craftivism (I Googled craft &amp; activism), and it changed my life – cheesy but true. </p>
<p><span>Craftivism is ""a way of looking at life where voicing opinions through creativity makes your voice stronger, your compassion deeper &amp; your quest for justice more infinite” (Betsy Greer, who coined the term in 2003). </span><span><em>   </em></span></p>
<p>Under Betsy's blessing, I started a blog – 'A Lonely Craftivist' (yes, very emo!). People got in touch. Many had felt burnt out by traditional activism or didn't feel they belonged in traditional activism groups like me and wanted to do something different. 1year later and we became the Craftivist Collective. Now we have hundreds of active members and thousands of supporters all over the world. </p>
<p><span>So what's so great about craftivism?</span></p>
<p><span>When you are doing cross-stitch or hand-embroidery it's hard not to take your time over it, to think about the issues one stitch at a time. I suddenly felt less like a Robot-Activist and was discussing global problems with other Craftivists, drinking tea, and using my talents. </span></p>
<p><span>I like encouraging people. I want people to be their best, to use their role in life for good. We need demonstrations and petitions, but we also need positivity. We don't demonise or shout. But we do support. We've made hankies for bankers and MPs, willing them to use their influence for the most vulnerable in society. We embroider quotes, facts, and questions on mini-banners that inspire thought and don't push an answer. </span></p>
<p><span>Craftivism is an alternative for people who don't find the traditional, more extrovert forms of activism comfortable. We do our craft in public, in cafes, on public transport, and in squares and parks. People like to come up and ask us what we're up to, and have a chat. We don't flyer, or hold placards, or use megapones. Because of that we get publicity. We've been in magazines, national newspapers, on French TV, and images of our work are tweeted, uploaded, and blogged to stimulate discussion on global issues. For and introverted activist it's the perfect way to go.</span></p>
<p>Craftivism is a tool in the box of activism. Sometimes we need to kick and shout. Sometimes we need to sit alongside and whisper something beautiful. </p>
<p><span><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We need £6,000 to produce a small book of craftivism. It sounds like a lot but we want a high quality beautiful thing people will keep and share. It will </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>explain the and benefit of craftivism for maker, viewer and reciever</span></li>
<li><span>have a gallery of things we've done for people to do or be inspired to do their own stuff</span></li>
<li><span>and a selection of how-to projects</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We've got all the contents of the book pretty much sorted, and, in the spirit of Craftivism, are dreaming of putting something out in the world that is beautiful, cherished, shared, and inspires people to do something similar. If you have any suggestions of content and style, send us an email.  </p>
<p><span>Cicada Books, the publishing company, are supporting us, by putting up half of the money. That gives us the chance to grow this little book from the roots up. We want your support, and we would be proud to have your name in a list of Craftivists and supporters at the back of the book. Craftivism is a movement, for anyone to be part of. </span></p>
<p>Cicada specialise in high-end art, craft, and design books. They create quirky, alternative books that reflect the  unique voices of the artists. They're a perfect fit for our small but ambitious project.  </p>
<p><span>Cicada focuses on collaborations with new and emerging design talents from all over the world. the books have a quirky, alternative edge that reflects the individual voices of the artists and writers involved.  Cicada captures the essence of movements and scenes in the artworld that are happening right now.</span></p>
<p><span>Cicada Books will then put the book together (we've already been dreaming about paper stock!), and distribute into bookshops worldwide with the help of Thames &amp; Hudson Publishers. </span></p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong> </p>
<p><span>Currently there are no little accessible introductory books to craftivism.</span></p>
<p><span>We want to create something that you can leave next to the toilet, give as a cheap gift to a friend, or pick up at the till of an art bookshop. We want people to be able to make their own project, and think about global issues of justice in while putting something beautiful out there in the world. </span></p>
<p><span>In the words of the collective ‘A spoonful of craft helps the activism go down’. </span></p>
<p><span>We’d like you to help us administer this rather delightful medicine! :)</span> </p>
<p><span><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Spread the word about our project (obvs;p) and this campaign on your google+, facebooks and twitters and all those other social media sites you might be a part of. There are little ""share"" and ""like"" buttons under the title image of this campaign, you can use those, and the short URL.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for taking time to hear us out. </span></p>

When you are doing cross-stitch or hand-embroidery it's hard not to take your time over it, to think about the issues one stitch at a time. I suddenly felt less like a Robot-Activist and was discussing global problems with other Craftivists, drinking tea, and using my talents. 
I like encouraging people. I want people to be their best, to use their role in life for good. We need demonstrations and petitions, but we also need positivity. We don't demonise or shout. But we do support. We've made hankies for bankers and MPs, willing them to use their influence for the most vulnerable in society. We embroider quotes, facts, and questions on mini-banners that inspire thought and don't push an answer. 
Craftivism is an alternative for people who don't find the traditional, more extrovert forms of activism comfortable. We do our craft in public, in cafes, on public transport, and in squares and parks. People like to come up and ask us what we're up to, and have a chat. We don't flyer, or hold placards, or use megapones. Because of that we get publicity. We've been in magazines, national newspapers, on French TV, and images of our work are tweeted, uploaded, and blogged to stimulate discussion on global issues. For and introverted activist it's the perfect way to go.
Craftivism is a tool in the box of activism. Sometimes we need to kick and shout. Sometimes we need to sit alongside and whisper something beautiful. 
What We Need & What You Get
We need £6,000 to produce a small book of craftivism. It sounds like a lot but we want a high quality beautiful thing people will keep and share. It will 

explain the and benefit of craftivism for maker, viewer and reciever
have a gallery of things we've done for people to do or be inspired to do their own stuff
and a selection of how-to projects

We've got all the contents of the book pretty much sorted, and, in the spirit of Craftivism, are dreaming of putting something out in the world that is beautiful, cherished, shared, and inspires people to do something similar. If you have any suggestions of content and style, send us an email.  
Cicada Books, the publishing company, are supporting us, by putting up half of the money. That gives us the chance to grow this little book from the roots up. We want your support, and we would be proud to have your name in a list of Craftivists and supporters at the back of the book. Craftivism is a movement, for anyone to be part of. 
Cicada specialise in high-end art, craft, and design books. They create quirky, alternative books that reflect the  unique voices of the artists. They're a perfect fit for our small but ambitious project.  
Cicada focuses on collaborations with new and emerging design talents from all over the world. the books have a quirky, alternative edge that reflects the individual voices of the artists and writers involved.  Cicada captures the essence of movements and scenes in the artworld that are happening right now.
Cicada Books will then put the book together (we've already been dreaming about paper stock!), and distribute into bookshops worldwide with the help of Thames & Hudson Publishers. 
The Impact 
Currently there are no little accessible introductory books to craftivism.
We want to create something that you can leave next to the toilet, give as a cheap gift to a friend, or pick up at the till of an art bookshop. We want people to be able to make their own project, and think about global issues of justice in while putting something beautiful out there in the world. 
In the words of the collective ‘A spoonful of craft helps the activism go down’. 
We’d like you to help us administer this rather delightful medicine! :)

<p><strong>Selling in the South</strong> is a fun and informative book that helps explain some of the cultural differences that makes Americas a great place to live. We are very diverse country and we all have things that make us special… the way you shake hands with someone or talk to a lady in public you may think is the same all over the country, but there are certain things you could be doing that may be seen as offensive by someone here in the south.</p>
<p>Southern hospitality is a topic we cover in great detail in this book. You will learn that bless your heart will have a bunch of meanings and I will give you some pointers on how you should respond to this little comment</p>
<p>As a true southern salesman who has worked selling a variety of products that range from personal and business insurance to high tech 3-D engineering software, my experiences will help you see that all sales training does not work the same in all areas of the country.</p>
<p>I am a student in the art of selling and I have spent tens of thousands of dollars personally to learn everything I could about selling. I have attended tons of seminars, read hundreds of books (yes, folks in the south do really read) , I have also listened to thousands of hours of tapes and cd’s of by the so called masters of sales.</p>
<p>One of the things that stood out to me was the idea that people are exactly the same across the country and they should respond the same way to these generic sales tactics. What that sound like to me is ONE SIZE FITS ALL… and in my experience, the one size fits all approach to anything doesn’t fit anybody to well.</p>
<p>Now I will be the first to tell you that there are some basic fundamentals that do work all across the country but what you will learn in this book are the things that make selling in the south different. My focus is not what is right and wrong but just to point at how things appear to people who may not share your same life experiences…</p>
<p>I believe that this book had to be written to clear a few things up and to help us all communicate better.</p>
<p>I have some real good yankee buddies and they have a view of the world and life that I never will understand and I’m sure the feeling is mutual.  This book celebrates the differences and shows ways we can work together.</p>
<p>This book is not just for Yankees who have been transplanted in the south but it is for everybody. If you are not directly in sales, you may ask why you should read this book, well let me tell you… In life you may have the pleasure of dealing with a Southerner while you are in New York, now he or she will probably still have some of the traits and ideas that are discussed here.</p>
<p>You will be playing a big part in helping our country grow and be more successful by supporting this project. It is simple and easy to donate.</p>
<h3>Thank you in advance for your support, and if you have an interest in having me speak to your organization about selling in the south, just give me a call.</h3>

with Your Beloved,”©
and now that it’s finally self-published, I have a fabulous opportunity to get
it seen Nation-wide:  Steve
Harrison’s Publicity Summit in NYC this spring, will train me and put me
face-to-face with the top 100 US media producers for five minutes each.  One good interview on a TV show like
“Oprah” or “Good Morning America” could shoot my book to the top of the charts
and make it an “overnight success.”  This Campaign will be just the beginning of creating media exposure.</p>
<p>Having been a well-known cover girl, actress, producer, and
best-selling author, I’ve been in the public eye for years:  Just to name
a few, I’ve appeared on CBS’s “Morning Show,” ABC’s “Good Morning America,” and

<p>With contributors like you pledging to pre-buy a copy of ""Heartgasm!"" (either for yourself or a loved one  you <i>know </i>can benefit from the book's content), is just the beginning!</p>
<p><b>The Impact You Can
Make &amp; How You Benefit </b></p>
<p>I visualize this campaign as the beginning of a movement
that will help to transform relationships throughout the world — and <i><u>you</u></i> can be part of that
movement.  You can be the hero/heroine
that forges the way to replace the old dysfunctional paradigm of our parent’s
world, into partnerships in which compassion, communication, love, trust, and
intimacy are the key words.  Wouldn't you love to participate in making this happen?  We can go for <i>total
global transformation</i>!</p>
<p><u>Unique Perks</u></p>
<p>Many of our perks are identical to what we offered in our
last Indiegogo campaign to self-publish ""Heartgasm!""  However, several people have asked for
perks related to my career as a supermodel, so we've created two perks that
will help a beginner-model to get started — both of them Skype-coached by me
personally!</p>
<p>We also have a few unique items that have been contributed
by our supporters, including a verified hand-signed framed Dali print, some cool collector's items, and a ""surprise"" perk that is on its way.</p>
<p>BOOK PLEDGES of $25 or more will earn you a soft-cover
AUTOGRAPHED copy of my book to be mailed to you on within a few weeks of the
closing of this campaign.  Add $20
to any of the other higher pledges and you’ll also get an autographed copy (please mention that you want this when you pledge).</p>
<p>ANY PLEDGE OF OVER $100 ALSO INCLUDES: Your name as a
“patron” in the Acknowledgements section of the newest version of ""Heartgasm!,"" an invitation to the
Media-book-launch party; and a framed print of the book cover personalized for
you.</p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>In order to accomplish our goal of raising $30,032 for me to
attend the spring Publicity Summit, we expect to pre-sell somewhere between
1,700 and 2,000 books — So the lion’s share of the budget goes to paying for
the printing and shipping of these books. </p>
<p>The other really important items in this budget include
paying our team of interns/virtual assistants who are helping us <i>immeasurably</i> to be seen in social media,
to update our Indiegogo page, and to shoot and edit video as needed. They are
the ""engine"" that is getting us out to more and more people every
day.</p>
<p>Also, we are giving a 5% donation of gross funds collected,
to The WIN, the Women's Information Network (<a href=""http://www.thewinonline.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thewinonline.com/</a>), because of the amazing work that
they are doing with women all over the world.</p>
<p>If we raise more money than we’d anticipated, and people
order more books, than we planned, then any excess funding will go into additional marketing and promotion of ""Heartgasm!,"" including <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">printing and shipping costs of the book. However, if
we </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">don't</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> raise our entire goal, we
plan to use as much of what we've raised to partially pay for the Publicity
Summit, and we’ll start another campaign to complete the balance needed to make sure that this
happens.  You can see the entire
budget by clicking <a href=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/1055525/files/20131001100739-Budget.Pub.Sum.Indiegogo.Campaign.08-16-13.doc?1380647262"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</span></p>
<p><b>Heartgasm! Facts </b></p>
<p>If you’ve seen or have a
copy of “Heartgasm!,” I’m sure you’ll agree that not only does it just <i>‘feel good in your hands,’</i> but that it’s
beautifully produced and most importantly, the content is even better than I’d
originally visualized:</p>
<p>Due to the suggestion from a genius in the book-publishing
arena, I discovered how to re-frame “Heartgasm!” with the “H.E.A.R.T. System” which
I subsequently created.  If this
method and its processes are sincerely followed and practiced, it promises to
transform relationships into amazingly satisfying, sacred, and successful
partnerships.  (To find out more
about what’s in the book click <u><a href=""http://images.indiegogo.com/medias/1059387/files/20131003130552-Heartgasm_Overview_10-03-13.doc?1380830755"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a></u>).</p>
<p>We were also very lucky to obtain testimonials from people
like long-time CNN talk-show host, Larry King;  Michael Butler, the producer
of Broadway Musical, and film “Hair”; and
multiple-best-selling author, Robert Allen.</p>
<p>Thanks to those who participated in my 2011 campaign to
self-publish “Heartgasm! — Increasing Intimacy &amp; Ecstasy with Your
Beloved.”  We successfully raised <i>over</i> our goal, the amount of $4,333, to
fund my newly published book!  You
can <i>still</i> see that campaign here: <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/heartgasm/x/304725"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/heartgasm/x/304725</a>.</p>
<p><b>Hey folks, please
help us to get a shout out and make some noise about this campaign!</b></p>
<p>For this round of crowd-funding, we’re partnering with
several other like-minded groups. 
Among them are:  The NPO, Revitalization
Ministry; and The WIN (Women’s Information Network mentioned above), both of whom
have goals similar to that of the spirit of “Heartgasm!,” which is to promote
extraordinarily compassionate, communicative, and truthful bonds in all our
relationships, including our own ‘beloveds’ (whether or not it is our own
higher-inner-selves, or our chosen partners).  [Click <u></u><a href=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/1059405/files/20131003131457-Our_IGG_Partners_10-03-13.doc?1380831299"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> to see a
list of our partners and their Websites].</p>
<p>Partnerships like these will enable us to reach even greater
numbers of people — very much like having an extended family who can help us to
share the benefits of “Heartgasm!” with their friends, family, business, or
their lifestyle-associations.</p>

<p><b>How We Can Get “Most
Popular” Status/Exposure on Indiegogo</b></p>
<p>We need to raise 25 to 30% of our goal from “my inner
network” in approximately the first couple of weeks, to achieve a “most
popular” status, thereby being seen “up-front” when entering Indiegogo’s home
page.  Otherwise it might be difficult to find us if we didn’t personally send you to our page.</p>
<p><b>PLEASE USE PayPal TO
MAKE YOUR PLEDGES</b>.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I <b>strongly</b>
encourage you to pre-buy “Heartgasm!” (or our other pledges) through <b>PayPal</b> because that way <u>WE CAN ACCESS
THE FUNDS RIGHT AWAY</u> to pay for the Summit. 
Otherwise, when the campaign competes on November 11th, it then takes two more weeks to be paid<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> — </span>thus having to wait to receive “non-PayPal” pledge payments until November 25<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Please understand that you <u>DO NOT</u> need to have a
PayPal account to pay — PayPal will bill your debit or credit card.  VERY
EASY to do — taking less than five minutes of your time!!!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks so much for making my even greater dream — that of
having more people discovering and benefiting from the transformations in their
lives provided by “Heartgasm!” — come true.</p>
<p>Many thanks for <i><u>sharing

Due to the suggestion from a genius in the book-publishing
arena, I discovered how to re-frame “Heartgasm!” with the “H.E.A.R.T. System” which
I subsequently created.  If this
method and its processes are sincerely followed and practiced, it promises to
transform relationships into amazingly satisfying, sacred, and successful
partnerships.  (To find out more
about what’s in the book click here).
We were also very lucky to obtain testimonials from people
like long-time CNN talk-show host, Larry King;  Michael Butler, the producer
of Broadway Musical, and film “Hair”; and
multiple-best-selling author, Robert Allen.
Thanks to those who participated in my 2011 campaign to
self-publish “Heartgasm! — Increasing Intimacy & Ecstasy with Your
Beloved.”  We successfully raised over our goal, the amount of $4,333, to
fund my newly published book!  You
can still see that campaign here: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/heartgasm/x/304725.
Hey folks, please
help us to get a shout out and make some noise about this campaign!
For this round of crowd-funding, we’re partnering with
several other like-minded groups. 
Among them are:  The NPO, Revitalization
Ministry; and The WIN (Women’s Information Network mentioned above), both of whom
have goals similar to that of the spirit of “Heartgasm!,” which is to promote
extraordinarily compassionate, communicative, and truthful bonds in all our
relationships, including our own ‘beloveds’ (whether or not it is our own
higher-inner-selves, or our chosen partners).  [Click here to see a
list of our partners and their Websites].
Partnerships like these will enable us to reach even greater
numbers of people — very much like having an extended family who can help us to
share the benefits of “Heartgasm!” with their friends, family, business, or
their lifestyle-associations.
So whether or not you choose to contribute by making a
pledge, 
here are some ways you can help to forward this campaign:
*  Connect us
with other like-minded groups, organizations, and/or non-profits.
*  Suggest
contact with an organization needing a speaker for their events - perhaps we can parlay this into a
partnership now (or for future campaigns).
*  Please use
the Indiegogo ‘Share Tools,’ to connect on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,
Pinterest and other social media venues.
*  Please sign up here http://RelateLoveSex.com/ or on       the http://www.tonidemarco.com/ Website
(up, but still under construction), to become part of our contact list and continue
receiving updates on the progress of Heartgasm via my blog,  http://relatelovesex.blogspot.com/ 
How We Can Get “Most
Popular” Status/Exposure on Indiegogo
We need to raise 25 to 30% of our goal from “my inner
network” in approximately the first couple of weeks, to achieve a “most
popular” status, thereby being seen “up-front” when entering Indiegogo’s home
page.  Otherwise it might be difficult to find us if we didn’t personally send you to our page.
PLEASE USE PayPal TO
MAKE YOUR PLEDGES.  


I strongly
encourage you to pre-buy “Heartgasm!” (or our other pledges) through PayPal because that way WE CAN ACCESS
THE FUNDS RIGHT AWAY to pay for the Summit. 
Otherwise, when the campaign competes on November 11th, it then takes two more weeks to be paid — thus having to wait to receive “non-PayPal” pledge payments until November 25th.
Please understand that you DO NOT need to have a
PayPal account to pay — PayPal will bill your debit or credit card.  VERY
EASY to do — taking less than five minutes of your time!!!

Thanks so much for making my even greater dream — that of
having more people discovering and benefiting from the transformations in their
lives provided by “Heartgasm!” — come true.
Many thanks for sharing
this with everyone you know who can use “Heartgasm!”  in their lives! 
Love & blessings,

<p><em><i>Flashpoint</i> </em>is an anthology of 
original speculative fiction, the fourth volume in the popular <i>Speculative Elements </i>series. Publication is scheduled for late 2014. <br/></p>
<h3>Who is Third Person Press?</h3>
<p>We are a small, independent publisher based on Cape 
Breton Island, Nova Scotia. We have a proven track record of producing 
quality publications while nurturing and promoting the writers we work 
with. It's important to us to be able to pay our writers decent rates

region. Your support will help us keep doing that, and you'll get some 
great perks into the bargain!</p>

including some to be used for reviews, giveaways, and promotional 
purposes. We'll pay for the perks for our kind supporters, and other 
costs involved in the production, launch, and promotion of the book. If we have 
anything left over (a pretty big if!), we'll put it toward other Third 
Person Press projects and goals, like future anthologies and 
collections.</p>
<p>We think you'll like our cool perks for this campaign.
 In addition to the usual thank-yous and recognition, we have copies of 
the book and/or ebook, bookmarks, and <i>Flashpoint</i>-themed jewelry, as well as some special perks for our writer

Flashpoint is an anthology of 
original speculative fiction, the fourth volume in the popular Speculative Elements series. Publication is scheduled for late 2014. 
Who is Third Person Press?
We are a small, independent publisher based on Cape 
Breton Island, Nova Scotia. We have a proven track record of producing 
quality publications while nurturing and promoting the writers we work 
with. It's important to us to be able to pay our writers decent rates 
for their work, and to promote great speculative fiction from our 
region. Your support will help us keep doing that, and you'll get some 
great perks into the bargain!




What We Need & What You Get


First and foremost, the funds we receive will go to pay our contributors for their stories in Flashpoint. Beyond
 that, we'll be paying to print and ship the actual physical copies, 
including some to be used for reviews, giveaways, and promotional 
purposes. We'll pay for the perks for our kind supporters, and other 
costs involved in the production, launch, and promotion of the book. If we have 
anything left over (a pretty big if!), we'll put it toward other Third 
Person Press projects and goals, like future anthologies and 
collections.
We think you'll like our cool perks for this campaign.
 In addition to the usual thank-yous and recognition, we have copies of 
the book and/or ebook, bookmarks, and Flashpoint-themed jewelry, as well as some special perks for our writer 
friends. All this is in addition to other books from our catalogue, printable artwork, a detailed 
critique of your own writing--even dinner out with the editors!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need at least 10K to get this project started.  While full project may cost more, the 10K will at least allow the bathroom renovations to happen.  </li>
<li>We are providing church T shirts, which are black, to those who donate at least $200.  </li>
<li>If we do not reach this goal, however we are praying that we do, then we will continue to raise funds until we have enough for the bathroom renovations.  </li>

Thanks TIM</p><p>The Population Bomb will explode early in the 22nd Century as incredible advances in medicine and biotechnology – ranging from cloning, cell revitalization and nanotechnology – significantly increase human longevity. These advances will result in many of our future great-great-grandchildren living to be 150-years old and beyond. Thus, by 2150, as many as seven generations of one family may be living at once - from a 150-year-old matriarch to a new-born baby. </p><p>This phenomenon will replicate the life of the Phoenix, the mythical bird that rose from the ashes to live a much longer life. Thus: The Phoenix Condition. Sadly, it is this condition that will swell population densities in an already overpopulated world and lead to billions in the 22nd Century and beyond living in abject poverty. </p><p>Key4hope is a social media think tank that offers a blueprint for a positive future. My name is Tim Donohue and I’m the executive director of Key4hope. My team and I firmly believe that for the first time in human history, we possess the technology and the ingenuity to control our future. Key4hope, located at <a href=""http://www.key4hope.com,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.key4hope.com,</a> offers over 100 predictions for a better tomorrow including possible solutions to ending world hunger, defusing the Population Bomb and rebuilding much of the Amazon Rainforest. </p><p>And your support can help promote this thank tank and get these ideas published in book form so together we can save lives and make a better future for our future generations. </p><p>As for the Phoenix Condition, it is important to add right away that 150-year olds in the mid-22nd Century won’t look and feel like 150-years old. Fortunately, face transplants and age disguising (coupled with safe energy modules inserted into the body that will systematically release “energy”) will keep even senior, senior citizens looking and feeling young.  </p><p>How will the Phoenix Condition come about and what are the repercussions of this impending and enormous population growth? Michael Crichten, the author of the best-selling novel “Jurassic Park” wrote in the book’s forward: “Biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history...it will outdistance atomic power and computers in its effect on our everyday lives."" </p><p>Advancements in this field alone over the next 100 years will be astounding. Specifically, scientists are on the verge of routinely cloning internal body parts from a person's own cells. This will be among the greatest medical advancements this century. It cannot be over-emphasized that once we can clone our OWN organs - such as our kidneys or heart - we have overcome the tremendous problems of organ rejection and organ availability. With younger versions of our own organs in our bodies, well, think of the obvious health benefits – and, of course, how long we will eventually live. </p><p>It’s important to note that all diseases ranging from cancer to AIDS to diabetes will be cured within the next 50 years – thanks to advances in biotechnology aided by computers much more powerful than today’s models. Again, these advances will add significantly to future generations’ life spans.</p><p>However, bionics will eventually overtake cloning. Sophisticated bionic kidneys, livers, eyes and hearts will compete with cloned organs in the 2040s and beyond but bionics will win out because bionics with intricate backup systems using nanotechnology will eventually prove superior to nature’s models. Someday there will be awe-inspiring mechanical hearts that will always keep a person's blood flowing - even after death. Someday there will be artificial kidneys that never fail, bionic eyes that will always see, and artificial lungs that will always keep us breathing. </p><p>By 2060, bionics will allow the average recipient to run faster than Jerry Rice, lift heavier items than Arnold, and be able to leap over -- well, maybe not tall buildings in a single bound -- but certainly over tall objects, and, most importantly, death rates will plummet.  These advancements will lead to people in the industrialized world in the 22nd Century living to be 150-years and beyond.</p><p>Looking At History</p><p>To Preview The Future</p><p>Most people don’t seem to realize how quickly technology advances. But a short history lesson should help. Between the Wright Brothers' first flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina in 1903 and the inaugural launch of the Space Shuttle in 1981 stood 78 years. During that time, in the field of aviation technology, miraculous advancements were achieved. Three-quarters of a century saw a box-kite-like machine that floundered like a fish out of water transform into a sleek, efficient vessel capable of making multiple journeys into space -- all this in 78 years!</p><p>In 1982, Dr. Barney Clark, who suffered from a severe case of heart disease, was the recipient of the world's first artificial heart. His life was prolonged an additional 112 days. A mere 78 years later, the ""Space Shuttle"" of artificial hearts was perfected. The machine was hailed by the citizens of 2060 as ""more reliable than the real thing."" Shortly thereafter, the whispers of immortality grew.</p><p>Death As A Rare Event</p><p>Let’s think about this. When death becomes an endangered species, what will happen to our planet? </p><p>According to a United Nations’ report: “World Population Prospects: the 2012 Revision”,  this world’s population is expected to peak at 9.6 billion by 2050, and then begin a slow decline. But this report is wrong because it does not take into account extreme increases in longevity. </p><p>While The Phoenix Condition will never fully take root in developing countries because bionics and replacement parts are expensive, the trickle down effects will significantly increase longevity in vast areas of this planet currently in population trouble.  But certainly, as each generation of biotechnology improves, the cost of these life-extending devices will decline. Eventually, a market of cheaper or used biotech hearts and kidneys will thrive in many developing countries.</p><p>Today, Mexico’s population density is approximately 62 people per square kilometer compared to the United States’ population density of 34 (World Bank, 2013). But what will Mexico’s population density be by 2150 as The Phoenix Condition trickles down over the Rio Grande? True estimates of population densities nearly 150 years from now currently don’t exist. So allow me: Mexico’s population density will be a lot higher than 62 people per square kilometer – keeping in mind that Mexico is currently overpopulated. Will Mexico’s population density be over 100 per square kilometer? Will it be over 150? And if so, what will the quality of life be like in Mexico?</p><p>The Phoenix Condition will also lead to much misery in the Industrialized World. Overpopulation has always been a Third World ailment but imagine the quality of life in the United States if huge numbers of people stopped dying and our population eventually doubled or tripled. Could it be that some cities in our country will be so tightly packed that privacy is no longer a right, that most city streets become gigantic parking lots (filled with people, not cars), and rates of madness climb exponentially? Where will we put all these people?</p><p>The 500 Year Old Human</p><p>Allow me to go one step farther in my forecasts. There is the possibility that humans in the 23rd Century and beyond could live up to 500 years as some residents of that time opt to have their brains transplanted into robot bodies. Okay, a moment to recover from the shock. 200 years from now, citizens can choose to have their brains placed into robot bodies impossible to distinguish from real human bodies. They can also choose the physical characteristics they desire – such as height, race, sex, freckles, dimples or a sly smile. To help people live even longer and more lucidly, “Brain pumps” – that habitually send vitamins and nutrients to the brain – will keep that organ healthy for many centuries. </p><p>Some residents will periodically change their robot bodies – just having a technician (a robot) remove their encased brain and place it into another robot body. Just a short note: the connections between the encased brain and the robot’s nervous system are too complicated to explain here but suffice it to say – the connections are astonishing.  </p><p>Please remember I’m only the messenger – not the advocate. Transferring brains from one robot body to another robot body is Frankensteinism. Inhuman! I’m not saying we should do this, I’m saying that many citizens in the 23rd Century and beyond will choose this option. Of course, this will lead to even higher population densities.</p><p>The Phoenix Condition Is Coming!</p><p>The Phoenix Condition Is Coming!</p><p>If Paul Revere were alive today, it would be obvious what he would be shouting. </p><p>Our society is not very foresighted. For those who were adults in the year 2000, many can recall the Y2K problem, also known as the millennium bug, which involved computer programs that could not accurately change the date when 1999 changed into the year 2000. No one foresaw this challenge and thus panic arose in the late 1990s. Today, few realize that The Phoenix Condition is coming and thus have not considered the possible implications of a world where death rates drop significantly.

TIM</p><br/></div>","Will The Phoenix ConditionBe The Death of Us?This is the last week. Please help. Thanks TIMThe Population Bomb will explode early in the 22nd Century as incredible advances in medicine and biotechnology – ranging from cloning, cell revitalization and nanotechnology – significantly increase human longevity. These advances will result in many of our future great-great-grandchildren living to be 150-years old and beyond. Thus, by 2150, as many as seven generations of one family may be living at once - from a 150-year-old matriarch to a new-born baby. This phenomenon will replicate the life of the Phoenix, the mythical bird that rose from the ashes to live a much longer life. Thus: The Phoenix Condition. Sadly, it is this condition that will swell population densities in an already overpopulated world and lead to billions in the 22nd Century and beyond living in abject poverty. Key4hope is a social media think tank that offers a blueprint for a positive future. My name is Tim Donohue and I’m the executive director of Key4hope. My team and I firmly believe that for the first time in human history, we possess the technology and the ingenuity to control our future. Key4hope, located at www.key4hope.com, offers over 100 predictions for a better tomorrow including possible solutions to ending world hunger, defusing the Population Bomb and rebuilding much of the Amazon Rainforest. And your support can help promote this thank tank and get these ideas published in book form so together we can save lives and make a better future for our future generations. As for the Phoenix Condition, it is important to add right away that 150-year olds in the mid-22nd Century won’t look and feel like 150-years old. Fortunately, face transplants and age disguising (coupled with safe energy modules inserted into the body that will systematically release “energy”) will keep even senior, senior citizens looking and feeling young.  How will the Phoenix Condition come about and what are the repercussions of this impending and enormous population growth? Michael Crichten, the author of the best-selling novel “Jurassic Park” wrote in the book’s forward: “Biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history...it will outdistance atomic power and computers in its effect on our everyday lives."" Advancements in this field alone over the next 100 years will be astounding. Specifically, scientists are on the verge of routinely cloning internal body parts from a person's own cells. This will be among the greatest medical advancements this century. It cannot be over-emphasized that once we can clone our OWN organs - such as our kidneys or heart - we have overcome the tremendous problems of organ rejection and organ availability. With younger versions of our own organs in our bodies, well, think of the obvious health benefits – and, of course, how long we will eventually live. It’s important to note that all diseases ranging from cancer to AIDS to diabetes will be cured within the next 50 years – thanks to advances in biotechnology aided by computers much more powerful than today’s models. Again, these advances will add significantly to future generations’ life spans.However, bionics will eventually overtake cloning. Sophisticated bionic kidneys, livers, eyes and hearts will compete with cloned organs in the 2040s and beyond but bionics will win out because bionics with intricate backup systems using nanotechnology will eventually prove superior to nature’s models. Someday there will be awe-inspiring mechanical hearts that will always keep a person's blood flowing - even after death. Someday there will be artificial kidneys that never fail, bionic eyes that will always see, and artificial lungs that will always keep us breathing. By 2060, bionics will allow the average recipient to run faster than Jerry Rice, lift heavier items than Arnold, and be able to leap over -- well, maybe not tall buildings in a single bound -- but certainly over tall objects, and, most importantly, death rates will plummet.  These advancements will lead to people in the industrialized world in the 22nd Century living to be 150-years and beyond.Looking At HistoryTo Preview The FutureMost people don’t seem to realize how quickly technology advances. But a short history lesson should help. Between the Wright Brothers' first flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina in 1903 and the inaugural launch of the Space Shuttle in 1981 stood 78 years. During that time, in the field of aviation technology, miraculous advancements were achieved. Three-quarters of a century saw a box-kite-like machine that floundered like a fish out of water transform into a sleek, efficient vessel capable of making multiple journeys into space -- all this in 78 years!In 1982, Dr. Barney Clark, who suffered from a severe case of heart disease, was the recipient of the world's first artificial heart. His life was prolonged an additional 112 days. A mere 78 years later, the ""Space Shuttle"" of artificial hearts was perfected. The machine was hailed by the citizens of 2060 as ""more reliable than the real thing."" Shortly thereafter, the whispers of immortality grew.Death As A Rare EventLet’s think about this. When death becomes an endangered species, what will happen to our planet? According to a United Nations’ report: “World Population Prospects: the 2012 Revision”,  this world’s population is expected to peak at 9.6 billion by 2050, and then begin a slow decline. But this report is wrong because it does not take into account extreme increases in longevity. While The Phoenix Condition will never fully take root in developing countries because bionics and replacement parts are expensive, the trickle down effects will significantly increase longevity in vast areas of this planet currently in population trouble.  But certainly, as each generation of biotechnology improves, the cost of these life-extending devices will decline. Eventually, a market of cheaper or used biotech hearts and kidneys will thrive in many developing countries.Today, Mexico’s population density is approximately 62 people per square kilometer compared to the United States’ population density of 34 (World Bank, 2013). But what will Mexico’s population density be by 2150 as The Phoenix Condition trickles down over the Rio Grande? True estimates of population densities nearly 150 years from now currently don’t exist. So allow me: Mexico’s population density will be a lot higher than 62 people per square kilometer – keeping in mind that Mexico is currently overpopulated. Will Mexico’s population density be over 100 per square kilometer? Will it be over 150? And if so, what will the quality of life be like in Mexico?The Phoenix Condition will also lead to much misery in the Industrialized World. Overpopulation has always been a Third World ailment but imagine the quality of life in the United States if huge numbers of people stopped dying and our population eventually doubled or tripled. Could it be that some cities in our country will be so tightly packed that privacy is no longer a right, that most city streets become gigantic parking lots (filled with people, not cars), and rates of madness climb exponentially? Where will we put all these people?The 500 Year Old HumanAllow me to go one step farther in my forecasts. There is the possibility that humans in the 23rd Century and beyond could live up to 500 years as some residents of that time opt to have their brains transplanted into robot bodies. Okay, a moment to recover from the shock. 200 years from now, citizens can choose to have their brains placed into robot bodies impossible to distinguish from real human bodies. They can also choose the physical characteristics they desire – such as height, race, sex, freckles, dimples or a sly smile. To help people live even longer and more lucidly, “Brain pumps” – that habitually send vitamins and nutrients to the brain – will keep that organ healthy for many centuries. Some residents will periodically change their robot bodies – just having a technician (a robot) remove their encased brain and place it into another robot body. Just a short note: the connections between the encased brain and the robot’s nervous system are too complicated to explain here but suffice it to say – the connections are astonishing.  Please remember I’m only the messenger – not the advocate. Transferring brains from one robot body to another robot body is Frankensteinism. Inhuman! I’m not saying we should do this, I’m saying that many citizens in the 23rd Century and beyond will choose this option. Of course, this will lead to even higher population densities.The Phoenix Condition Is Coming!The Phoenix Condition Is Coming!If Paul Revere were alive today, it would be obvious what he would be shouting. Our society is not very foresighted. For those who were adults in the year 2000, many can recall the Y2K problem, also known as the millennium bug, which involved computer programs that could not accurately change the date when 1999 changed into the year 2000. No one foresaw this challenge and thus panic arose in the late 1990s. Today, few realize that The Phoenix Condition is coming and thus have not considered the possible implications of a world where death rates drop significantly. Most certainly this world is unprepared for the extremely high population densities that will swell nations such as Nigeria, Brazil and the Philippines within the next 200 years. Will the quality of life in these developing nations where obese overpopulation limits jobs, school opportunities, stable governments, and dreams resemble the seventh layer of Dante’s Hell? And what will occur if our world experiences a global financial meltdown or a major environmental catastrophe that strikes an entire continent? Will we enter a new Dark Age?Much Of The Developing WorldIs Headed In The Wrong DirectionNow that we’ve identified the problem, what is the solution?

AFSP’s mission is to “save lives and bring hope to those affected by suicide”, focusing on funding research, education, advocacy, and supporting survivors.  https://afsp.org/ Story of My Book:I wrote this book because I see a need for change. Everyday, young people are losing classmates, peers, friends, partners, and siblings to suicide and mental illness. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for my age group. For young people ages 10-34, the second leading cause of mortality is death by suicide. As a country, we need to do more to look at suicide through a public health lens and to address the fragmentation that is our current mental health care system.News articles about college students have hit the media hard, referring to a “college student mental health crisis.” Suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, excessive alcohol use, and mental illness are often joked about on a college campus. Universities, large and small, across the nation are struggling with how best to keep up with an increasing demand for services.Articles are quick to focus on problems, rather than focusing on potential solutions. As a college student, with lived experience of mental illness, a clinical fellow, and a young researcher passionate about studying suicide risk in adolescents and young adults, it is evident that there is a crisis. However, I aim to bring a unique perspective by speaking to what it is that we can be doing. In this book, you'll learn about:
Research on the current state of mental illness and suicide on college campuses. 
Themes and insights in suicide prevention from leaders who I interviewed including: 

Alison Malmon from Active Minds

Patrick Kennedy from The Kennedy Forum

John MacPhee from The JED Foundation

Dr. Rosie Phillips Davis from American Psychological Association

Dr. Tom Insel from MindStrong

Robert Gebbia from American Foundation for Suicide Prevention

Kelly Davis from Mental Health America

Jennifer Rothman from National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)

Dr. Daniel Reidenberg from Suicide Awareness Voices of Education

Amy Kulp from American Association of Suicidology

Dr. Beth Ann Griffin from RAND Corporation

Dr. Benjamin Locke from Collegiate Center for Mental Health and Penn State University

Case study of student experiences at the University of Rochester.

<p><i>Farm (and Other F Words)</i> is a book that explores why we farm the way we do, and how we might grow farms differently to grow more good food, create good jobs, and achieve good environmental outcomes.<br/><br/>My name is Sarah Mock and I am the author of <i>Farm (and Other F Words)</i>. I’m a freelance agriculture and rural issues reporter, who grew up on a small family farm in Wyoming. I’ve spent the last decade traveling across the country and around the world to better understand why we farm the way we do in America. I’ve learned how the most ambitious and progressive farm and food entrepreneurs are offering healthier, more affordable food while using less exploitative farm work, and working to be land and resource protectors.<br/><br/>In reading this book, you’ll discover that you know a lot more about food and farming than you might think. Together, we’ll interrogate the origin of the small family farm in America, understand why we call some people who work on farms “farmers” and others “farm workers” (and why it matters), and build a playbook to help current and aspiring farmers, investors and entrepreneurs, policymakers and non-profits, and regular people support a more beneficial and just food system every day.<br/><br/>You’ll learn from dozens of farmers, entrepreneurs, founders, and funders what a radically different food system might look like, and how we get there, together. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How a California company revolutionized canned tomatoes by eliminating all managers and embracing self-management.</li>
<li>How a pair of young, first generation cattle grazers are turning a hundreds of years old ranching model on its head to professionalize regenerative beef.</li>
<li>How BIPOC farming communities have kept alive agricultural traditions that offer a true alternative to our modern farming system.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>You will love this book if you have questions about where your food comes from, and felt like you haven’t gotten the full story. You’ll love this book if you’re a skeptic who enjoys the farmers market, but wonders how accessible high-priced, healthy food is to all. And you’ll love this book if you dream of hanging up your office job one day, finding a few acres somewhere, and learning how to grow food.<br/><br/><i>Farm (and Other F Words) </i>speaks to current and aspiring farmers (and those who support them) who want to grapple with questions of growing food and supporting communities in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Farm (and Other F Words)</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can I really do to support a more just food system?</li>
<li>What should we expect from the people and organizations that feed and clothe us?</li>
<li>Are small family farms really the best way to grow food?</li>
<li>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.</li>
</ul> <h3>The Book - Farm (and Other F Words)</h3>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1, The Rise and Fall of the Small Family Farm</strong>, contains the author’s note + chapters 1-7. In this section, we’ll dive into the mystery of the missing farms, we’ll meet current farmers from all around the country and understand how they’re succeeding or failing to provide good food, good jobs, and good environmental outcomes. We’ll trace the small family farm all the way back to its earliest origins in the US, and learn about the alternative models we didn’t choose then, but could now.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2, Big Team Farms</strong>, contains chapters 8-12. This section will explore farming models that focus specifically on creating good food, good jobs, and good environmental outcomes. Current farm and food business do this, not by prioritizing small scale and family ownership, but by pursuing landscape-level management, finding profitable market opportunities, and valuing their employees, rather than exploiting them. Chapter 12 discusses how technology fits into a future of farming that emphasizes human outcomes, rather than economic ones.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3, The Big Team Farm Playbook </strong>contains chapters 13-17. In these highly tactical chapters, we’ll discover quick insights from the book’s characters to help guide anyone looking to participate in supporting Big Team Farms, from policymakers and non-profits to current farmers and everybody else. This section is the brief chaser for those looking to take action (and is riddled with fun Easter eggs!), and will be information you’ll want to return to again and again.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>The <strong>editor</strong> I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April, 2021.</li>
<li>The <strong>cover design</strong> of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The <strong>layout design</strong> for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The <strong>copy editing</strong> for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The <strong>launch &amp; promotion</strong> efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this coming Spring.</li>
</ul>
<br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<p>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish (and I mean personal).</p>

<p>And much more!</p> <h3>About the Author</h3>
</div><p>Sarah Mock splits her time between freelance farm and rural issues reporting (find her work at The Guardian, Civil Eats, AgFunderNews, and others) and advising progressive farm businesses on marketing, strategy, and business development.<br/><br/>Sarah has been plumbing the agricultural world for nearly three decades, looking for answers to fundamental questions about how to make farms pay, what drives decision-making at the farm level, how to farm without damaging environmental resources, and how to grow food exploiting humans. Farm (and Other F Words) is the culmination of much of that work, and will also act as a playbook for her career going forward, as she strives to nurture and support the Big Team Farms of tomorrow.<br/><br/>Since volunteering as tribute from Wyoming, Sarah now lives in Washington, DC with her partner Bryan and her dog Sagan. She enjoys not only trying to piece together the existential puzzles of farming, but also real jigsaw puzzles as well. She’s a connoisseur of obscure ice cream/custard flavors and is an amateur self-taught vacuum clean repair enthusiast.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Sarah at sarahkmock1@gmail.com and at @sarah_k_mock on Twitter.</p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use.

I’m here to reinvent an old, familiar tale into something topical, relatable, and cringey that takes nostalgia and adds a thick coat of modernism to it.

We have outlined a specific goal for a specific number of books. However, as stated earlier, the more we raise, the more we print. This also goes for the opposite, in that if we don’t hit our goal, we print fewer. But, we'll focus on the positive for now, and aim sky high!  OH, THE REASONS TO CREATE!Morals never change, but the stories always do. Since humans first learned how to communicate, we’ve been telling stories to entertain, frighten, comfort, warn, and evoke emotion. Now we live in an age of never-ending remakes, adaptations, and regurgitated art. So instead of trying to convince an audience I’ve made something never-before-seen, why not embrace it and make something originally derivative. I’m not here to tell a new story... I’m here to reinvent an old, familiar tale into something topical, relatable, and cringey that takes nostalgia and adds a thick coat of modernism to it. I want people to feel like they can look at topical issues and not be afraid to talk about them, while also giving a good laugh along the way. Truth is easier to swallow when it rhymes and tickles your funny bone.OH, THE WAYS YOU CAN HELP!Any little bit helps, but if you find yourself strapped at the moment, the best thing you can do is spread the word. Email this to a friend, share it on your Facebook/Twitter/Instagram, talk about it with your next Tinder date. If every person shares with at least two others... well, you can imagine the places it will take us.  I’ve poured my heart & soul into this project, and now, I’m excited to not only to take the next step, but to invite others on this journey.For updates on the campaign and snippets of the book, follow this page, or my Instagram @wiechipedia",9.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We believe Lit Camp should be a conference for talented writers...not rich writers. So we work very hard to keep the cost of attending Lit Camp as low as possible...without compromising our commitment to staffing our conference with the best authors, literary agents, and editors in the country. We are equally committed to never turning away a writer we accept because of money.</p>
<p>To make all this possible, we're turning to this campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising funds to pay the travel expenses for the stellar faculty we've assembled for 2019...Jonathan Lethem, Dana Spiotta, Alexander Chee, and NY literary agent, Brettne Bloom. </p>
<p>We are also hoping to have enough money left to offer scholarships to Lit Camp for at least 2 (and possibly more) deserving writers.</p>
<p>Every cent we raise will go toward the conference.</p>
<p>Lit Camp is a nonprofit. No one on the Lit Camp Board draws a salary. In fact, each board member contributes $500/year to remain on the board.</p>
<p>To make contributing painless, we're offering some pretty amazing literary perks. Manuscript reviews, help with query letters, literary coaching...and our awesome new Lit Camp baseball jerseys.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Getting a book (in any genre) out into the world isn't easy...even for the most talented writers. Lit Camp helps facilitate the journey from aspiring writer to published author. Our workshop faculty has years of experience as teachers of creative writing, and the agents and editors we invite are experts on the world of publishing.</p>

I wrote this book because I realized that there are a myriad of opportunities for us to harness language in our everyday lives, but we often don’t know how. I wanted to learn how successful professionals in a variety of fields use rhetoric to help them achieve their goals, and also dig into research on how we can all learn to be more effective communicators. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover practical tips and tricks for how you can better utilize language in your everyday interactions, and also learn to better understand how rhetoric impacts your life. This book will serve as a guidebook for how you can get a better hold on your life by getting a better hold on rhetoric. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how to use rhetoric to achieve success. You'll hear stories such as:</p><ol>
<li>How Ancient Greek and Roman academics viewed rhetoric, and taught it</li>
<li>How rhetoric can have a life or death impact on patients in the medical field </li>
<li>How you can use rhetoric to become a better leader and negotiator </li>

Convinced that despite what some say, words do matter, Rachel set out on a research journey to learn more about rhetoric and how it impacts our everyday lives. <br/><br/>Rachel is an avid musical theater fan, and is disheartened that Broadway is still shut down. While she’ll be one of the first audience members streaming into theaters when they open back up, she’s been keeping herself busy by reading almost one book a week and learning how to knit during the pandemic.

<h2>What is Glitter Husk?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>GLITTER HUSK is a chapbook of poems exploring the links between pleasure, grief, &amp; memory. A chapbook if a short collection of poems centered on uniting themes (25-30 pages). While this is not a full-length book, the chapbook will serve as a sampling of what poems I've been writing for the past two years. </p>
<p>GLITTER HUSK is also a POETRY &amp; PERFORMANCE TOUR. With GLITTER HUSK, I want to tour the southeast to perform collaborative shows at coffee shops, bookstores, poetry slams, music halls, dive bars, back porches, museums, &amp; elsewhere. </p>
<p>GLITTER HUSK is also an audio book. In the interest of making the poetry project accessible to as many people as possible, purchases of the GLITTER HUSK chapbook will include an audio book of the poems (read by me!)</p>
<p>GLITTER HUSK is what happens when you bejewel the shucked shedding of a cicada.</p>
<p>GLITTER HUSK is more than just a book, but rather also an artistic project inviting collaboration, community building, &amp; serious conversation about mental health, addiction, &amp; surviving grief.</p>

<h3>Why is Glitter Husk important to me?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>GLITTER HUSK is a community-publishing project.</p>
<p>I want this project to rely on the people I love. You, the friends I've made along this crazy journey. You, the folks who have uplifted &amp; taught me, who have buoyed me into greater heights of joy &amp; understanding.</p>
<p>I want this book to be one created, produced, &amp; funded by my community. </p>
<p>This is my ""Big Ask.""</p>
<p>Let's put a new chapbook of poetry into the world. Let's help these poems travel across the country &amp; perhaps the world. The poems included in this slim collection are some of the most important poems I've written in my life. Some of them have appeared in journals, which you can read on my website, and some of them will be brand new.</p>
<p>Let's make this gorgeous anomaly into a book.</p>

</div></div>","What is Glitter Husk?
 
GLITTER HUSK is a chapbook of poems exploring the links between pleasure, grief, & memory. A chapbook if a short collection of poems centered on uniting themes (25-30 pages). While this is not a full-length book, the chapbook will serve as a sampling of what poems I've been writing for the past two years. 
GLITTER HUSK is also a POETRY & PERFORMANCE TOUR. With GLITTER HUSK, I want to tour the southeast to perform collaborative shows at coffee shops, bookstores, poetry slams, music halls, dive bars, back porches, museums, & elsewhere. 
GLITTER HUSK is also an audio book. In the interest of making the poetry project accessible to as many people as possible, purchases of the GLITTER HUSK chapbook will include an audio book of the poems (read by me!)
GLITTER HUSK is what happens when you bejewel the shucked shedding of a cicada.
GLITTER HUSK is more than just a book, but rather also an artistic project inviting collaboration, community building, & serious conversation about mental health, addiction, & surviving grief.

Why is Glitter Husk important to me?
 
GLITTER HUSK is a community-publishing project.
I want this project to rely on the people I love. You, the friends I've made along this crazy journey. You, the folks who have uplifted & taught me, who have buoyed me into greater heights of joy & understanding.
I want this book to be one created, produced, & funded by my community. 
This is my ""Big Ask.""
Let's put a new chapbook of poetry into the world. Let's help these poems travel across the country & perhaps the world. The poems included in this slim collection are some of the most important poems I've written in my life. Some of them have appeared in journals, which you can read on my website, and some of them will be brand new.
Let's make this gorgeous anomaly into a book.

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p>My name is Tino Chibebe, and I am the author of The Black Opportunity. I was inspired to write this book because, from the outside looking in, there was a lack of people that looked like me in the venture capital space. Venture capital is a type of financing that startup companies with high long-term growth potential receive from investors. I believe that this space will continue to shape the world for generations to come. I want black voices to be included in that vision of the world. I want to see a world that includes products by them and for them and to see businesses by black people getting the investment and attention they deserve.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the challenges that black people in Belgium are facing, challenges that exclude them from the venture capital (VC) space in Belgium. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with the intersection of VC, entrepreneurship and Afro-Europeans and learn what the current landscape is like in Belgium and what needs to be done to get black people a seat at the table.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you’re interested in VC, entrepreneurship, and inclusion.<br/><br/>The Black Opportunity speaks to venture capitalists and entrepreneurs in Belgium who want to grapple with inclusion and innovation in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that The Black Opportunity inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p>How do we tap into the underrepresented black community in Belgium?</p>
<p>What are the challenges that black entrepreneurs face?</p>
<p>How do we create inclusive environments within VC?</p>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing venture capital, entrepreneurship, and minority participation will change us all for the better.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Book - The Black Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. In this section, the reader will learn about the situation in Belgium, regarding black entrepreneurs and VCs. The reader will be introduced to VC, how it came to be, and what it looks like right now in Belgium. Belgium is one of the most innovative hubs for entrepreneurship in Europe but is still behind in terms of black inclusion.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 4-6. Within these chapters, the reader will learn about how to create inclusive spaces within VCs and gain insight into how to approach some of the socio-economic situations black people face in Belgium and beyond. In one case, a black female founder’s fortune only changed when she got a white male founder on board. The unexpected consequences, however, were that VCs thought he was the brains behind the operation and ignored her in meetings. We find out what causes some of these prejudices and how to recognize them.</p>
<p>Black Belgians are one of the most qualified communities when it comes to tertiary education but fail to find jobs that align with their qualifications. We find out why this is, how this affects the way VC teams look and what the way forward is from industry experts.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters 7-9. In this section, there will be case studies on the effect of diversity in VC teams. We will also get insights into what diverse VC teams investing in diverse founders can do for the startup community and the marginalized communities themselves. We also look into the unicorn effect and how that can create start up mafias like the PayPal and FlipKart mafias. Diversity is valuable. It results in better decisions and yields better returns.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book.

<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>
<p>I am a talented communicator, all-around ""good guy"" and digital native who makes any work environment more enjoyable and efficient. I am deeply involved in life at the KU Leuven, formerly holding responsibilities on behalf of the university as President of Capitant Brussels, ""the student's gateway to financial markets in Belgium,"" and also a former member of the Business Student Society of Brussels, an organization that empowers future business leaders.<br/><br/>In addition to university life, and always having wanted to make a difference, I have involved myself in non-profit organizations. Previously, I held the position of Lead Mentor at MCW Global, a social entrepreneurship incubator. In the past at The Best of Both Charity, I was Head of Marketing, and at Sight - Impact Brand, I held the position of Digital Brand Manager and Media Specialist and later Marketing Director. Both projects were geared to developing underdeveloped regions, especially where education and entrepreneurship in Africa is concerned.<br/><br/>Being a creative and innovative thinker, I have applied these qualities to both developing effective marketing collateral for organizations and successfully communicating them across multiple digital media platforms. In addition to socially driven projects, I also enjoy writing, and so here we are :) I have written for Complex's Greenlabel, was previously LinkedIn Campus Editor, part of the Brussels Writer's Circle, and have a Medium following of 200+ fans.<br/><br/>In addition to writing, I love rap music especially Drake. Maybe I like Drake a little too much.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with me at tfchibebe@gmail.com and through LinkedIn at<br/><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinochibebe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinochibebe/</a>.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3><strong>About <i>Tolkien’s Overture</i></strong></h3><p>In <strong><i>Tolkien’s Overture</i></strong><i>,</i> writer and podcaster John Carswell continues his exploration of Tolkien’s lesser known works by turning his attention to “Ainulindalë”, also known as “The Music of the Ainur.”</p><p>Originally published as part of <i>The Silmarillion</i> in 1977, “Ainulindalë” is the creation story of Middle-earth. Like the biblical creation account, it begins mysteriously with one great Divinity, but from there goes down a far different path. Whereas the biblical story involves speaking creation into being, Tolkien’s vision involves the creation of lesser gods who then create a great music that brings Middle-earth into reality.</p><p>In <i>Tolkien’s Overture</i>, John conducts a close reading of the text of “Ainulindalë”, and then goes on to explore the role of music in Middle-earth’s history, from the creation of Elves, Dwarves, and Men in the First Age to the great events of the late Third Age as recounted in <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Furthermore, it delves into the mystery of evil, as embodied in the mighty Melkor, the great villain of the First Age and the mentor of Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor.</p><p>From the mystical song of the seas to the voice of Lúthien to the strangely musical ways of Tom Bombadil, the reader will come away with a far deeper understanding of Tolkien’s imaginary world, and see clearly how music is truly the preternatural fabric from which Middle-earth is made.</p><h3>Act Now to Be a Part of <i>Tolkien’s Overture</i> <u>Forever</u>...</h3><p>Thank you so much for considering supporting <strong><i>Tolkien’s Overture</i></strong>. “Ainulindalë” is an incredible legend, and I can’t wait to share my insights on it with the world! Like <i>Tolkien’s Requiem</i>, this book will be self-published. That means I need to cover the up-front costs, including the cover art creation, pre-printing production, and the finalization of the manuscript.</p><p>For anyone who supports the project financially, you will get some freebies along the way (see <strong>Other Reasons You Should Contribute</strong> below). For those able and willing to contribute at a higher level, there are some great perks available.</p><p>In addition to the paperback, e-book, MP3 audiobook, and PDF versions that will be available at publication, the following perks are available for those who financially support this fundraising campaign for <strong><i>Tolkien’s Overture</i></strong>:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>BOOK PATRON</strong>: Have your name listed in all copies of the book as a “Patron”.</li>
<li>
<strong>LIMITED EDITION SIGNED COPY</strong>: Limited to 150 numbered and specially-sealed copies. They will be autographed (and personalized if you would like). Furthermore, you will be given a special designation in the list of Patrons. Finally, you’ll get an extra paperback copy so that you don’t have to risk damaging this copy when you read the book.</li>
<li>
<strong>EXECUTIVE EDITOR</strong>: Limited to 14. All the above perks PLUS you will be listed as 1 of 14 Executive Editors on one of the first pages of the book. Additionally, you’ll receive 5 paperback copies to sell, give as gifts, or whatever else you’d prefer.</li>
<li>
<strong>EXECUTIVE EDITOR + PROOF</strong>: Only 1! Get the one-of-a-kind PROOF copy. You receive all the perks of the previous tiers AND be listed above the 14 Executive Editors on one of the first pages of the book.</li>
</ul><p>Additionally, there will be several special “<strong>BOOK PATRON AND ABOVE</strong>” giveaways through the course of this fundraising campaign.</p><h3><strong>About John Carswell</strong></h3><p>John Carswell is the co-host and producer of <i>The Tolkien Road</i> podcast (<a href=""http://tolkienroad.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TolkienRoad.com</a>), which is dedicated to the in-depth exploration of JRR Tolkien’s works from <i>The Silmarillion</i> to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.

</ul></div>","About Tolkien’s OvertureIn Tolkien’s Overture, writer and podcaster John Carswell continues his exploration of Tolkien’s lesser known works by turning his attention to “Ainulindalë”, also known as “The Music of the Ainur.”Originally published as part of The Silmarillion in 1977, “Ainulindalë” is the creation story of Middle-earth. Like the biblical creation account, it begins mysteriously with one great Divinity, but from there goes down a far different path. Whereas the biblical story involves speaking creation into being, Tolkien’s vision involves the creation of lesser gods who then create a great music that brings Middle-earth into reality.In Tolkien’s Overture, John conducts a close reading of the text of “Ainulindalë”, and then goes on to explore the role of music in Middle-earth’s history, from the creation of Elves, Dwarves, and Men in the First Age to the great events of the late Third Age as recounted in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Furthermore, it delves into the mystery of evil, as embodied in the mighty Melkor, the great villain of the First Age and the mentor of Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor.From the mystical song of the seas to the voice of Lúthien to the strangely musical ways of Tom Bombadil, the reader will come away with a far deeper understanding of Tolkien’s imaginary world, and see clearly how music is truly the preternatural fabric from which Middle-earth is made.Act Now to Be a Part of Tolkien’s Overture Forever...Thank you so much for considering supporting Tolkien’s Overture. “Ainulindalë” is an incredible legend, and I can’t wait to share my insights on it with the world! Like Tolkien’s Requiem, this book will be self-published. That means I need to cover the up-front costs, including the cover art creation, pre-printing production, and the finalization of the manuscript.For anyone who supports the project financially, you will get some freebies along the way (see Other Reasons You Should Contribute below). For those able and willing to contribute at a higher level, there are some great perks available.In addition to the paperback, e-book, MP3 audiobook, and PDF versions that will be available at publication, the following perks are available for those who financially support this fundraising campaign for Tolkien’s Overture:

BOOK PATRON: Have your name listed in all copies of the book as a “Patron”.

LIMITED EDITION SIGNED COPY: Limited to 150 numbered and specially-sealed copies. They will be autographed (and personalized if you would like). Furthermore, you will be given a special designation in the list of Patrons. Finally, you’ll get an extra paperback copy so that you don’t have to risk damaging this copy when you read the book.

EXECUTIVE EDITOR: Limited to 14. All the above perks PLUS you will be listed as 1 of 14 Executive Editors on one of the first pages of the book. Additionally, you’ll receive 5 paperback copies to sell, give as gifts, or whatever else you’d prefer.

EXECUTIVE EDITOR + PROOF: Only 1! Get the one-of-a-kind PROOF copy. You receive all the perks of the previous tiers AND be listed above the 14 Executive Editors on one of the first pages of the book.
Additionally, there will be several special “BOOK PATRON AND ABOVE” giveaways through the course of this fundraising campaign.About John CarswellJohn Carswell is the co-host and producer of The Tolkien Road podcast (TolkienRoad.com), which is dedicated to the in-depth exploration of JRR Tolkien’s works from The Silmarillion to The Lord of the Rings. His first book, Tolkien’s Requiem: Concerning Beren and Lúthien, was published in 2015, and has received widespread acclaim. He writes about Tolkien and other matters at TrueMyths.org.Praise for Tolkien’s Requiem

<p><em>Jersey Shore</em>, <em>Brooklyn 11223</em>, and <em>Mama’s Boys of the Bronx</em> are currently the only representations of Italian Americans in our culture. So, if you’re Italian American you have very few positive images to identify with, and if you’re a woman, these positive images are even less.

<p>It’s time to take back our voice. </p>
<p>I am of Italian descent, and I lived in Rome for 6 months. While in Rome, I completed a research project on Italian women's responses to visual culture. It was a truly informative project.  </p>
<p>After this experience, I attended grad school for Women's &amp; Gender Studies at DePaul University. While at DePaul, I had my first vision about this project. I had to put it on the backburner, however, while I finished my thesis. </p>

</p><h3>Briefly</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Remember those five-year plans from the old Soviet Union? Well, this is nothing like them, except that it's a
five-year plan. I'm Dan Smith, a field archaeologist at Jamestown, Virginia, and I have a number of projects I'm trying to
complete over the next five years. I'm writing two books, one fact and one
fiction, developing a many-year dream of making an animated film about the
first permanent English colony in the New World, and trying to buy my
late brother's farm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In short, the Indiegogo funding will be used for
four main goals:</p>
<p><span>-<span>  </span></span>Finishing my second nonfiction book: The biography
of Dr. William M. Kelso (2014)<br/></p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Finishing my first fiction novel (first half of 2016)<br/></p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Creating an animated film about the founding of  Jamestown, Virginia (by 2019)<br/></p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Purchasing my late brother’s farm (which the first three depend on) (2014)</p>
<p>Any funds raised by this campaign will be used for
purchasing my late brother's farm. I'm really hoping to keep his farm in the family. If the full amount isn't met, I will use
whatever is available as part of a down payment and will again try traditional
lenders. Hopefully, that will convince them of my sincerity and determination
to purchase the farm. If they still are not interested, my sister-in-law, Lynn,
has suggested she might consider owner financing. That will still require a down
payment, though, so please be assured that the funds from this campaign will be
used for the farm purchase. That is my primary goal and it is taking all of my
free time. I really want to get back to my writing and get my next two books
finished! If you'd like more details, please read on. . . .</p>
<p>
</p><h3>Details, details, details</h3><p>Note: The video above is being used because Indiegogo said folks really want to see who is running the campaign. It's the best one I have so far, but I'll add one with details about the farm soon. In the meantime, please enjoy some information about what we archaeologists find and do!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Writing</h4>
<p>The nonfiction book is a biography of the preeminent
practicing historical archaeologist today, Dr. William M. Kelso. The working title
is “<strong>Phoenix Summoned: Resurrecting
Lost Worlds from the Ashes</strong>,” and it covers his life and over 50 year
career of excavating and interpreting the origins of the United States, most
notably Jamestown and the original 1607 James Fort site. I've discussed the
project with a literary agent who has handled similar works before, some with
excellent sales records, and she is very interested in this title. I expect to
have this written by the end of the year. (The graphic below is for
illustration only--not the real cover. The image is from Microsoft's free
clipart collection, and is supposed to be a phoenix.)</p>

<p></p><p>
</p><p>Speculative fiction best describes my other current book
project. I've already written about 20,000 words for it, most of them in a
couple creative writing classes. Its working title is “<strong>The Wanderer</strong>,” and it's
about a man with an unusual ability who travels the world anonymously, for
various reasons, but his power makes him noticed and sought after by those who
wish to exploit it. I like it because I get to use my graduate degree in
international relations and security issues, but it also explores the
psychology and motivations of individuals as they choose to do good or bad, at
both personal and agency levels. It's much more complex, and interesting, I
think, than I'm making it seem here, and I'll be glad to provide excerpts
before it's published to those who help fund these plans. I'm expecting to have
this finished in the first half of 2016. (Once again, the image below is not the real
cover, just another Microsoft clipart.)</p>

<p>
</p><h4>Filming</h4>
<p></p><p>Philip L. Barbour edited a three-volume set titled <i>The
Complete Works of Captain John Smith</i>. Included are the known writings of
John Smith, one of the founding colonists for the first permanent English
colony in the New World, which grew into the present-day United States. There
have been many books and movies about Jamestown
and John Smith, but too many myths have grown from the previous works--most
notoriously the completely unfounded story that John Smith and Pocahontas were
romantically involved. For many years I've wanted to make a film, or films,
based on the best sources we have for the early years of the founding of Jamestown--the
written record left behind by the people who were actually there. Barbour's
work is the best place to start because Smith's writings tell such an exciting
story that no myth or rumor is necessary to make it thrilling--from his time as
a slave in Hungary, to defeating and beheading three Turkish soldiers in
single, hand-to-hand combat, to being one of the founders of what became the
most powerful nation the world has ever known. I'd like to use Smith's own
words to tell this story, and CGI animation is the best vehicle for the
project in mind. I have a couple decades of IT experience, but very little with computer animation. Part of my five-year plan is to try to interest an established studio in the project or, if not, then learn that art and assemble
a team to help bring Smith's words to life. This is where the five years come
in--it will probably take that long to bring this to fruition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p><h4>Farming</h4>
<p></p><p>The fourth immediate goal of this plan is to buy my late
brother's farm. The writing listed above was proceeding well, but a few months
ago my sister-in-law decided she wanted to sell the farm, which is where I
live. Since then, all of my free time has been dedicated to trying to find funding
to make the purchase, so my writing has ground to a halt.</p>
<p>My brother and I worked his small farm for over 20 years
(we were raised on our parents' farms), and we had many projects we wanted to
do, once we had the time. One major goal was to build greenhouses and try to
grow warm weather crops all year. This we hoped to accomplish by incorporating
solar energy to keep the houses heated at night and in the cold months. Related
was experimenting with solar “double cropping,” which allows solar energy
collectors and field crops to share the same space (see the map below for the
locations of this and other farm plans). We wanted to try to make the farm and residence run
entirely on sustainable, renewable energy, and in this location in Virginia,
solar energy is the best option so far.

</p>
<p>Some of the ideas for winter crop production are based on
a system being developed by Eliot Coleman and detailed in <i>The Winter Harvest
Handbook</i>. He describes raising cool weather crops in Vermont
throughout the year, even without a heating system. We believed that if he
could do that in Vermont, we
could do even more in the relatively temperate climate of Virginia.
We also wanted to establish orchards and vineyards which, with the greenhouses,
would allow us to supply local markets with fresh produce all year. And because the local honeybee populations have been severely diminished, we planned to set up hives on the south side of the farm to help increase their numbers. My brother,
Donny, passed away before we could realize those plans, and now I'm trying to
reach those goals by buying his farm from his widow, but it's not easy to find
the funds needed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/373692/files/20140216105004-farm_plan_big.jpg?1392576604"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>As can be seen in the graphic above, there are many plans
for the 11 acre farm. On the right can be seen the animal paddock. Here I hope
to have open range for dogs, and maybe a few other animals, I’ll get from
shelters. We always had many animals on my parents’ farms, but I never liked
the idea of raising animals just as food sources. I hope to provide space for
animals to live their lives as they want, with no threat of being sold for
slaughter. The rest of the graphic is fairly self-explanatory.

<p>
</p><h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>As an archaeologist, I earn very little money. All of us on
the crew realize that the real reward for excavating at Jamestown is
rediscovering, understanding, and sharing what endures of one of the most
important and exciting historical sites in North America. We've already found
thousands of features, or places where humans dug in the ground and left
""signs"" we can read, and between 1.5 and 3 million artifacts,
depending on how they're quantified. In addition to the evidence from the early colony years, we've also found many other occupation remnants, including from the Revolutionary War and Civil War, and  thousands of Native American
artifacts, some dating as far back as at least 8,000 years. All of this is
helping us to understand the beginnings of what grew into the United States.</p>
<p>This leads to my Indiegogo campaign. Traditional funders
aren't as interested in archaeology, no matter what it's revealing, as they are
in salaries, so I haven't been able to find funding to help purchase my brother's farm. I've been living on the farm as a kind of caretaker, but now my
sister-in-law wants to sell it. She's offered it to me for $100,000 but, as noted,
traditional lenders aren't interested because of my salary. I've been scraping
by on what I earn, but it isn't enough to fund the farm purchase. Because my
other three main projects depend on being able to purchase the farm, I'm trying
to raise $75,000 with this campaign, hoping that traditional lenders will be
willing to finance the rest.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p><h4>The other projects depend on the farm purchase for a few
reasons:</h4><p></p>
<p>- One is that I need to stay near Jamestown
to continue to help save and understand what we can there while we still have
the chance--the iron, pewter, and bone artifacts are constantly deteriorating,
and we need to get them into the lab's controlled environment.</p>
<p>- I also need to stay at Jamestown
while working on Dr. Kelso's biography. He is the Director of Archaeology for
the site, and direct and frequent access to him is crucial for writing his biography.</p>
<p>- Another reason is that if I can't find funding, I'll
either have to try to find a much higher paying job, translated as moving away
from the area, or get a second job. Two jobs would make it very difficult, if
not nearly impossible, to finish my next two books (my first was as coauthor of
<i>Jamestown</i><i> Colony: A
Political, Social, and Cultural History</i>), and it wouldn't allow time to
develop the Jamestown film(s), or
even continue the farm plans. So, the first step is getting the farm purchased.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p><p></p><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/373700/files/20140216105612-Jamestown_Colony.jpg?1392576972"" src="""" style=""width: 195.588px; height: 253px;""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As mentioned above, my writing has been pretty much put on
hold for the past few months while I’ve been trying to find funding. With such
a tight deadline, any free time has been devoted to the farm purchase. The
increasing stress of the looming deadline and lack of interest from funders is,
as can be imagined, leading to extreme distraction—whenever I try to write, the
thought of having the farm being sold to someone other than me always intrudes
on my thoughts. Not only is there so much potential for the farm and solar/greenhouse
research projects I’m planning, but it also has tremendous sentimental value
for me—my brother and I worked on it together for 20 years, and it’s my last
connection to my only brother, who was also my best friend. I really hope to
keep his farm in the family.</p><p>So, if you can see the importance of telling the
story of the many contributions Dr. Kelso has made to the archaeological and
historical record of the earliest years of what became the United States, or
the additions the nonfiction book and film will make to the historical record, or
the potential of the solar and crop research, or even the fun the fiction book
might be to read, please consider helping support these efforts.<br/></p>

there, archaeology (I worked at prehistoric sites before my current work), or
anything else I understand well enough to talk about. I’ll provide my transportation
up to 150 miles from Jamestown, and we can discuss details about anything beyond
that.</p>
<p>$5000 – Dinner and discussion. I’ll come to your location, or you can come to
the Historic Triangle area here in Virginia, and we’ll have breakfast, lunch, or dinner and
discuss archaeology, writing, and solar/greenhouse farming (or almost anything

Briefly

Remember those five-year plans from the old Soviet Union? Well, this is nothing like them, except that it's a
five-year plan. I'm Dan Smith, a field archaeologist at Jamestown, Virginia, and I have a number of projects I'm trying to
complete over the next five years. I'm writing two books, one fact and one
fiction, developing a many-year dream of making an animated film about the
first permanent English colony in the New World, and trying to buy my
late brother's farm.

In short, the Indiegogo funding will be used for
four main goals:
-  Finishing my second nonfiction book: The biography
of Dr. William M. Kelso (2014)
- 
Finishing my first fiction novel (first half of 2016)
- 
Creating an animated film about the founding of  Jamestown, Virginia (by 2019)
- 
Purchasing my late brother’s farm (which the first three depend on) (2014)
Any funds raised by this campaign will be used for
purchasing my late brother's farm. I'm really hoping to keep his farm in the family. If the full amount isn't met, I will use
whatever is available as part of a down payment and will again try traditional
lenders. Hopefully, that will convince them of my sincerity and determination
to purchase the farm. If they still are not interested, my sister-in-law, Lynn,
has suggested she might consider owner financing. That will still require a down
payment, though, so please be assured that the funds from this campaign will be
used for the farm purchase. That is my primary goal and it is taking all of my
free time. I really want to get back to my writing and get my next two books
finished! If you'd like more details, please read on. . . .

Details, details, detailsNote: The video above is being used because Indiegogo said folks really want to see who is running the campaign. It's the best one I have so far, but I'll add one with details about the farm soon. In the meantime, please enjoy some information about what we archaeologists find and do!

Writing
The nonfiction book is a biography of the preeminent
practicing historical archaeologist today, Dr. William M. Kelso. The working title
is “Phoenix Summoned: Resurrecting
Lost Worlds from the Ashes,” and it covers his life and over 50 year
career of excavating and interpreting the origins of the United States, most
notably Jamestown and the original 1607 James Fort site. I've discussed the
project with a literary agent who has handled similar works before, some with
excellent sales records, and she is very interested in this title. I expect to
have this written by the end of the year. (The graphic below is for
illustration only--not the real cover. The image is from Microsoft's free
clipart collection, and is supposed to be a phoenix.)



Speculative fiction best describes my other current book
project. I've already written about 20,000 words for it, most of them in a
couple creative writing classes. Its working title is “The Wanderer,” and it's
about a man with an unusual ability who travels the world anonymously, for
various reasons, but his power makes him noticed and sought after by those who
wish to exploit it. I like it because I get to use my graduate degree in
international relations and security issues, but it also explores the
psychology and motivations of individuals as they choose to do good or bad, at
both personal and agency levels. It's much more complex, and interesting, I
think, than I'm making it seem here, and I'll be glad to provide excerpts
before it's published to those who help fund these plans. I'm expecting to have
this finished in the first half of 2016. (Once again, the image below is not the real
cover, just another Microsoft clipart.)




Filming
Philip L. Barbour edited a three-volume set titled The
Complete Works of Captain John Smith. Included are the known writings of
John Smith, one of the founding colonists for the first permanent English
colony in the New World, which grew into the present-day United States. There
have been many books and movies about Jamestown
and John Smith, but too many myths have grown from the previous works--most
notoriously the completely unfounded story that John Smith and Pocahontas were
romantically involved. For many years I've wanted to make a film, or films,
based on the best sources we have for the early years of the founding of Jamestown--the
written record left behind by the people who were actually there. Barbour's
work is the best place to start because Smith's writings tell such an exciting
story that no myth or rumor is necessary to make it thrilling--from his time as
a slave in Hungary, to defeating and beheading three Turkish soldiers in
single, hand-to-hand combat, to being one of the founders of what became the
most powerful nation the world has ever known. I'd like to use Smith's own
words to tell this story, and CGI animation is the best vehicle for the
project in mind. I have a couple decades of IT experience, but very little with computer animation. Part of my five-year plan is to try to interest an established studio in the project or, if not, then learn that art and assemble
a team to help bring Smith's words to life. This is where the five years come
in--it will probably take that long to bring this to fruition.




Farming
The fourth immediate goal of this plan is to buy my late
brother's farm. The writing listed above was proceeding well, but a few months
ago my sister-in-law decided she wanted to sell the farm, which is where I
live. Since then, all of my free time has been dedicated to trying to find funding
to make the purchase, so my writing has ground to a halt.
My brother and I worked his small farm for over 20 years
(we were raised on our parents' farms), and we had many projects we wanted to
do, once we had the time. One major goal was to build greenhouses and try to
grow warm weather crops all year. This we hoped to accomplish by incorporating
solar energy to keep the houses heated at night and in the cold months. Related
was experimenting with solar “double cropping,” which allows solar energy
collectors and field crops to share the same space (see the map below for the
locations of this and other farm plans). We wanted to try to make the farm and residence run
entirely on sustainable, renewable energy, and in this location in Virginia,
solar energy is the best option so far.


Some of the ideas for winter crop production are based on
a system being developed by Eliot Coleman and detailed in The Winter Harvest

throughout the year, even without a heating system. We believed that if he
could do that in Vermont, we

Donny, passed away before we could realize those plans, and now I'm trying to
reach those goals by buying his farm from his widow, but it's not easy to find
the funds needed.


As can be seen in the graphic above, there are many plans
for the 11 acre farm. On the right can be seen the animal paddock. Here I hope
to have open range for dogs, and maybe a few other animals, I’ll get from
shelters. We always had many animals on my parents’ farms, but I never liked
the idea of raising animals just as food sources. I hope to provide space for
animals to live their lives as they want, with no threat of being sold for
slaughter. The rest of the graphic is fairly self-explanatory.




Why Indiegogo?

As an archaeologist, I earn very little money. All of us on
the crew realize that the real reward for excavating at Jamestown is
rediscovering, understanding, and sharing what endures of one of the most
important and exciting historical sites in North America. We've already found
thousands of features, or places where humans dug in the ground and left

depending on how they're quantified. In addition to the evidence from the early colony years, we've also found many other occupation remnants, including from the Revolutionary War and Civil War, and  thousands of Native American
artifacts, some dating as far back as at least 8,000 years. All of this is
helping us to understand the beginnings of what grew into the United States.
This leads to my Indiegogo campaign. Traditional funders

The other projects depend on the farm purchase for a few
reasons:
- One is that I need to stay near Jamestown

the chance--the iron, pewter, and bone artifacts are constantly deteriorating,
and we need to get them into the lab's controlled environment.
- I also need to stay at Jamestown

not nearly impossible, to finish my next two books (my first was as coauthor of
Jamestown Colony: A

develop the Jamestown film(s), or
even continue the farm plans. So, the first step is getting the farm purchased.




As mentioned above, my writing has been pretty much put on

The PERKS!

Now a little about the perks! Since it will be
at least a couple years before I’ll have both books finished and start having
produce from the farm projects, and a few more years for the film, I’ll offer
some perks that are available now, with promises for the rest when they’re
ready.$1 - My everlasting gratitude. Contribute at this level and I will be forever grateful for your help in achieving these goals. Heck, I'll even throw this one in at all of the rest of the levels, too!



$5 – Email or tweet thank you. You’ll have my everlasting
gratitude, and I’ll send you a personal email or tweet saying so—no automated
responses here! This will accompany the rest of the perks, too.


$25 – A personal piece of history. I’ll send you a personalized,
handwritten thank you on a postcard postmarked at Jamestown,
 Virginia. This will accompany the rest of the perks, too. (Please include your mailing address with the other perks, too, if you'd like the postcard.)$50 - You're appreciated! At this funding level, I'll add your name to the list of contributors on my website. Everyone will know of your generosity!
$75 - YOUR arrowhead! Contribute at this level and I'll flintknap a quartzite arrowhead just for you! I learned the art of ""knapping"" on my first archaeology site, and I'll be happy to make one for you to show my appreciation! It won't be like any found at archaeology sites (because I'm not that good at it), but it'll be your own arrowhead.
$100 – You’re famous! – I’ll put your brief biography on my
website—a paragraph or two about why people find you so fascinating!
$100 - More pieces of history. I'll send you a signed Marshalltown
trowel like the ones we archaeologists use. It'll be signed thanking you personally!

$100 – Your haiku. Give me a few details about you, or a
subject that interests you, and I’ll compose a haiku for you. I never thought
about writing poetry, but we had to in one of my creative writing classes, and
I actually won second prize in one of the categories and an honorable mention
in another! I’ll send it by email or postcard (or both), your choice.
$150 - Phone call. If you'd like, and you're in the U.S.,
I'll call you at a mutually agreed upon time for
a conversation about anything you'd like (almost!). We can discuss my books,
the writing process, archaeology, the films I'm planning to make, the farm,
solar technology experiments I'm working on, etc.$150 – My first fiction book signed. After it’s published,
I’ll send you a personalized, signed copy of “The Wanderer.” I plan to finish
writing this book by the end of 2015.
$250 – My first book signed. You’ll get a personalized,
signed copy of my first book, Jamestown Colony, a Political, Social, and Cultural History.
$500 – My second nonfiction book signed. After it’s published, I’ll 
send you a signed copy of “Phoenix Summoned, Resurrecting Lost Worlds 
from
the Ashes,” the biography of Dr. William M. Kelso. Dr. Kelso has agreed 
to sign
your copy! (I'll sign it, too, if you'd like.) I plan to finish writing 
this
book by the end of 2014.
$500 – Thank you in “Phoenix Summoned.” I’ll thank you in
the acknowledgements of “Phoenix Summoned.”
$500 – Thank you in “The Wanderer.” I’ll thank you in the
acknowledgements of “The Wanderer.”$2500 – Your short story. Provide some details about you for
a short biography, or tell me something you’d like to have a short story
written about, and I’ll write that for you.
$5000 – Lecture at your place. I’ll come to your location and give an informal
lecture about my books, the farm and the solar and greenhouse research ongoing
there, archaeology (I worked at prehistoric sites before my current work), or
anything else I understand well enough to talk about. I’ll provide my transportation
up to 150 miles from Jamestown, and we can discuss details about anything beyond
that.
$5000 – Dinner and discussion. I’ll come to your location, or you can come to
the Historic Triangle area here in Virginia, and we’ll have breakfast, lunch, or dinner and
discuss archaeology, writing, and solar/greenhouse farming (or almost anything
you’d like!). I’ll provide my transportation up to 150 miles from Jamestown, and we can discuss details about anything beyond
that.

$150,000 – I'll help you write YOUR book! Ever wanted to write a book but didn't
have the time or patience? Fund all of the projects I'm working on and I'll help you write it! It can be about almost anything you'd like, if I can understand the
subject (no advanced particle physics, please). Maybe even your biography!
Purchasing the farm is only the beginning of these projects—they’ll all require
quite a bit of equipment and materials. I love to research and write, and making it all possible means you
deserve to have the world know your story! I have many years of writing, proofreading, and editing experience, and I'll be happy to work with you to get your book heading to the publisher. We can discuss the details of time and timeframe if you choose this option--just email me at dboydsmith@hotmail.com if you're interested in this contribution level.

<h3>Di quanto abbiamo bisogno, Come verrà speso, Cosa avete in cambio</h3>
<p>Di seguito, alcune informazioni sull'aspirante viaggio:</p>

<li>
<b>Chi dona decide</b> quali libri, film e personaggi aggiungere alla lista! E ottiene anche, a seconda del contributo, cartoline, video, GIF di ringraziamento, souvenir da New York e altro ancora. Cose simboliche, ovviamente, ma speriamo gradite.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sì, ok, ma perché?</h3>
<p>Siamo entusiasti di questo progetto perché, nelle intenzioni, si tratta di un'esperienza peculiare. È un qualcosa di molto personale ma anche in grado di esaltare persone di gusti e sensibilità diverse: chi non si è innamorato di una storia ambientata a New York?</p>
<p>Preciso: <b>ogni contributo è essenziale</b>. Non dovendo trovare fondi per un film o un'opera esosa, è tutta questione di singole donazioni. Alla fine <b>se potremo scrivere dalle strade di New York City</b>, arrivando a una percentuale di completamento soddisfacente, sarà grazie a persone innamorate della fiction ambientata nella Grande Mela.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Possiamo farcela?</h3>
<p><b>Noi pensiamo di sì</b>, altrimenti non ci avremmo provato. Ma se non riuscissimo a partire ad aprile, proveremmo comunque a trovare una soluzione, magari con altri aiuti. E state tranquilli, faremo in modo di <b>mantenere la promessa di consegnare tutti i perk</b>. (Logicamente non potremo mandare subito cartoline o souvenir da NY se non ci andiamo ad aprile perché i fondi non lo consentono, ma avete capito: faremo contenti tutti, ad aprile o dopo).</p>
<p>Ovviamente se non raccoglieremo abbastanza fondi per poter fissare una data di partenza, il progetto sarà dichiarato fallito e risarciremo tutti coloro che hanno contribuito.</p>
<h3>""Non posso fare contributi in denaro ma vorrei aiutarvi. Come?""</h3>
<p>Se non puoi contribuire un singolo centesimo alla nostra causa, andremo d'accordo comunque. Ecco <b>qualche altra cosa che puoi fare per me e Serena</b>. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Fornire una sistemazione a NY</b> (beh, non c'è da precisare che saremmo eternamente grati, ovviamente, ma ammetto che siamo in zona ""speriamo in una botta di fortuna"");</li>
<li>Passare a salutare a NY, se hai la fortuna di viverci;</li>

È tutto nel titolo, in pratica: un viaggio letterario. L'idea la dobbiamo a un pezzo pubblicato dove lavoro. L'autore descriveva una lunga passeggiata nei luoghi di Milano in cui sono ambientati alcuni classici della letteratura del XX secolo, accostando ai brani delle opere la realtà della metropoli odierna. Perché non farlo a New York?, ci siamo chiesti io e la mia compagna di viaggio.

Chi dona decide quali libri, film e personaggi aggiungere alla lista! E ottiene anche, a seconda del contributo, cartoline, video, GIF di ringraziamento, souvenir da New York e altro ancora. Cose simboliche, ovviamente, ma speriamo gradite.

Sì, ok, ma perché?
Siamo entusiasti di questo progetto perché, nelle intenzioni, si tratta di un'esperienza peculiare. È un qualcosa di molto personale ma anche in grado di esaltare persone di gusti e sensibilità diverse: chi non si è innamorato di una storia ambientata a New York?
Preciso: ogni contributo è essenziale. Non dovendo trovare fondi per un film o un'opera esosa, è tutta questione di singole donazioni. Alla fine se potremo scrivere dalle strade di New York City, arrivando a una percentuale di completamento soddisfacente, sarà grazie a persone innamorate della fiction ambientata nella Grande Mela.


Possiamo farcela?
Noi pensiamo di sì, altrimenti non ci avremmo provato. Ma se non riuscissimo a partire ad aprile, proveremmo comunque a trovare una soluzione, magari con altri aiuti. E state tranquilli, faremo in modo di mantenere la promessa di consegnare tutti i perk. (Logicamente non potremo mandare subito cartoline o souvenir da NY se non ci andiamo ad aprile perché i fondi non lo consentono, ma avete capito: faremo contenti tutti, ad aprile o dopo).
Ovviamente se non raccoglieremo abbastanza fondi per poter fissare una data di partenza, il progetto sarà dichiarato fallito e risarciremo tutti coloro che hanno contribuito.
""Non posso fare contributi in denaro ma vorrei aiutarvi. Come?""
Se non puoi contribuire un singolo centesimo alla nostra causa, andremo d'accordo comunque. Ecco qualche altra cosa che puoi fare per me e Serena. 


Fornire una sistemazione a NY (beh, non c'è da precisare che saremmo eternamente grati, ovviamente, ma ammetto che siamo in zona ""speriamo in una botta di fortuna"");
Passare a salutare a NY, se hai la fortuna di viverci;
Dirci dove mangiare i migliori hot dog del posto (ma non soltanto gli hot dog);

Diffondere questo progetto like no tomorrow. Aiuta molto.

<p>Because we do so much exploring, we figured we should put the most interesting routes in a book for everyone to enjoy! And the proceeds of the book could then be donated to charity.  The drivers of the project (Sandra and Pleun) both work for charities in Singapore, so it was decided to donate the books to RDA (Riding for the Disabled) and NCA (Netherlands Charity Association).

<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>To make sure as much money as possible goes to charity, we are raising money to get the book printed. And this is where you could help. We would like to have 2,000 copies of the book printed professionally, which would cost about S$ 3,600 (all the money we don’t spend on printing, will go directly to RDA and NCA). We then need to spend some money on postage (for the copies we sell during the campaign) and we would also like to throw a small launch party for everyone who helped making the book and to officially handover the book to NCA and RDA. We guestimate that we’d need about S$ 400.00, making it a total of S$ 4,000.-- (which in Euros is +/- 2,650.--)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the book</strong></p>
<p>The book will contain about 15 walks through all areas of Singapore. It will have point by point instructions on how to walk and what to look out for. The picture below is not the definitive layout, we are working on that as we speak, but it does give you an idea of where we are going with it!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What's Next?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, we would like to sell as many books as possible through this campaign. After we ship the books that are sold here on Indiegogo, we will donate the rest to RDA and NCA (50% each), who are planning to sell the books for around S$ 15.00 each.</p>

</h3><h3>Who am I and why I wrote this book</h3>
<div>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My name is Sahil Jaswal and I am an author and a copywriter for a leading firm in India. I hail from the military background, so I have travelled all my life accumulating knowledge from various regions and societies. Through my travels I realised that i liked people a lot and different kinds of people and over the years it became my strength to read into every single thing a person does and then it evolved from a person to society and to religions, countries, the world, the infinite. I have faced all the cultures and harsh reality the people bring about and I would like to expose people for they really are in order to inspire change, because sometimes all we need is a hard look at ourselves, to know where we changed and became what we are. </span><br/>
</div>
<h3>Short Summary of my Book</h3> <p>A journey through life of a lone soul. The pangs of the world, the nuances of communities, the politics of religions, the death of dreams, end of life as it is. This book inspires fantasy and dreams, it tells you what you can already see but can't look at. It's like air that you breathe constantly but don't take notice of. The book tells you exactly how heavy the is the burden of education, jobs, family, relationships and life itself. </p>
<p>A journey of a boy from when he was a child to when he grows and graduates from the most reputed college and then gives everything up for a higher path. How the values and ethics instilled in him by his simple-minded folks lead him to carry not only his burden but that of the worlds'. The loss of life, the rapes and molestations, the political dogma, the religious tacts, the wars, how they all end up in his basket of burden and how he tries to find salvation while bringing salvation to the world. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Your contributions will help to pay for the publishing  and promotion of the book. This involves designing the book cover and the cover art, creating the inner book design, editing, and copy editing, and then printing the book as well as advertising and publicity.  If we don’t reach our goal, the money that is raised will still help us with the cost and is very important to getting this project of the ground. And we have some wonderful and unique perks for you when you contribute.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>There are some gruesome and wildly inappropriate people in this world. People who don't know the difference between right and wrong and people who are incapable of judging one from another. A small mistake can lead to consequences that can't be reversed. We have come in a world where we see people making egregious comments on television that they can not support but still we will listen to them and in some countries even worship them because we are powerless. All the power that leaders say we have is make believe, we do not control anything. I realised this long back and realised we have gone so deep into the filth that people have forgotten how illuminated we once were. My book is a way to remind them of days where we were our own masters and we could get answers for anything we wanted, when we wanted because it wasn't complicated, it was just the truth, it was plain, simple, sometimes hard, but at least it was the truth. </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I have the first copy of the book ready with me that I got printed on my own. Finishing a book of 260 pages already, some say is commendable, I disagree, but I have. And then getting it published on my own without anyone's help is another thing I have accomplished. I have done everything I can do with the funds I have, I just need a little help to put my book out there and carry my message across to the world. </p>
<p>The risks I may face:</p>
<p>1. Even with all the money I put into the marketing and promotions of my book, it still may not be received well and I might not make any money out of it to promise anyone any accolades or free copies. (I hope I can though) </p>
<p>2. This industry is shaky and sometimes takes a toll. I think I can tackle it and hope I never crumble, but who knows the future. I have come this far on my own just a few painstaking steps more to go. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Every other detail is already thought of and weighed upon. I have a team of designers waiting to be paid for the book and a team of editors and hopefully some more will join the team for PR and marketing of the book.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>I urge you more to please spread the word about my book and the message it carries. I just want the world to be a better place. As cliched as it may sound and it may be unoriginal but it succinctly delivers my message. I have seen the harsh reality and I hope no one goes through it. Please use the tools that Indiegogo also provides to help me with my journey of making this world safer and secure for all of us. </div>

I hail from the military background, so I have travelled all my life accumulating knowledge from various regions and societies. Through my travels I realised that i liked people a lot and different kinds of people and over the years it became my strength to read into every single thing a person does and then it evolved from a person to society and to religions, countries, the world, the infinite. I have faced all the cultures and harsh reality the people bring about and I would like to expose people for they really are in order to inspire change, because sometimes all we need is a hard look at ourselves, to know where we changed and became what we are. 

Short Summary of my Book A journey through life of a lone soul. The pangs of the world, the nuances of communities, the politics of religions, the death of dreams, end of life as it is. This book inspires fantasy and dreams, it tells you what you can already see but can't look at. It's like air that you breathe constantly but don't take notice of. The book tells you exactly how heavy the is the burden of education, jobs, family, relationships and life itself. 
A journey of a boy from when he was a child to when he grows and graduates from the most reputed college and then gives everything up for a higher path. How the values and ethics instilled in him by his simple-minded folks lead him to carry not only his burden but that of the worlds'. The loss of life, the rapes and molestations, the political dogma, the religious tacts, the wars, how they all end up in his basket of burden and how he tries to find salvation while bringing salvation to the world.    What We Need & What You Get Your contributions will help to pay for the publishing  and promotion of the book. This involves designing the book cover and the cover art, creating the inner book design, editing, and copy editing, and then printing the book as well as advertising and publicity.  If we don’t reach our goal, the money that is raised will still help us with the cost and is very important to getting this project of the ground. And we have some wonderful and unique perks for you when you contribute.


  The Impact There are some gruesome and wildly inappropriate people in this world. People who don't know the difference between right and wrong and people who are incapable of judging one from another. A small mistake can lead to consequences that can't be reversed. We have come in a world where we see people making egregious comments on television that they can not support but still we will listen to them and in some countries even worship them because we are powerless. All the power that leaders say we have is make believe, we do not control anything. I realised this long back and realised we have gone so deep into the filth that people have forgotten how illuminated we once were. My book is a way to remind them of days where we were our own masters and we could get answers for anything we wanted, when we wanted because it wasn't complicated, it was just the truth, it was plain, simple, sometimes hard, but at least it was the truth.   Risks & Challenges I have the first copy of the book ready with me that I got printed on my own. Finishing a book of 260 pages already, some say is commendable, I disagree, but I have. And then getting it published on my own without anyone's help is another thing I have accomplished. I have done everything I can do with the funds I have, I just need a little help to put my book out there and carry my message across to the world. 
The risks I may face:
1. Even with all the money I put into the marketing and promotions of my book, it still may not be received well and I might not make any money out of it to promise anyone any accolades or free copies. (I hope I can though) 
2. This industry is shaky and sometimes takes a toll. I think I can tackle it and hope I never crumble, but who knows the future. I have come this far on my own just a few painstaking steps more to go. 

Every other detail is already thought of and weighed upon. I have a team of designers waiting to be paid for the book and a team of editors and hopefully some more will join the team for PR and marketing of the book.
