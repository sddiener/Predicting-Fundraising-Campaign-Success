Musicians are very lucky in this sense, but not everybody has the opportunity to make music.  We wanted to give everybody the opportunity to create music the same way musicians do. With OddBall, making beats is easy, intuitive, fun and can be done where ever you are.  
 
  Oddball comes in two parts, the ball, and the app. The ball behaves as the percussion trigger. Every time you bounce it off a surface, sensors at the heart of the ball communicate with the app via Bluetooth to play a sound through your headphones, speakers, or just the internal speaker on your phone. Oddball is pressure sensitive – The harder you bounce it the more intense the sound, the lighter you bounce it the more delicate.  
 You can loop your beats to make complex, intricate tunes, play over your favourite songs and add effects. Since Oddball is inherently shareable, the app will have it’s own social environment, where you can post your latest beats and share them with your community.  Oddball is the most versatile way to play music. Get bouncing, throwing, smashing, flicking, tapping – which ever way you choose to use it, have fun and see what you come up with. 
 Put your headphones, get outside and explore different ways to play with your surroundings.  
 
 
 One of the great things about Oddball is that you can play with multiple balls at the same time. Simply plug in a speaker, choose different sounds and jam with your mates. 
 
 Techno tennis anyone? How about augmenting your basketball game with a bass drum? 
  Or turn your office into a banging playground. 
 
 
 Use the ball in original ways. Challenge yourself to create new tricks. Use your imagination, let yourself discover unexpected grooves. 
 
 Oddball is ideal for people of all ages. The level of craft within the design make it a pleasure to use – whether you are a teenager, adult, or preteen kid with big ambitions, Oddball is for you. 
 We see Oddball as a fashion statement, choose the style that suits you. Oddball will come in different colours, so whether you are a 'Deep Purple' kind of person, a 'dance the blues' guy, or a 'want to paint it black' kinda gal there is a colour for you. 
 Vote here! We are running a poll to find out which are the most popular colours. The designs with the highest votes will become the first colours we will deliver to you. Do you like it load proud and proud, or cool dark and subdued? You choose.Also be sure to check out the Pimp your Oddball reward where you can really get nuts with the finish of your ball.We are really excited about this final stretch goal, which we are keeping secret for the moment. Stay tuned to find out exactly what it will be.

 To get all the experimental musicians excited, we made it possible to use Oddball as a velocity sensitive Bluetooth MIDI controller, so you can connect it to any DAW software on your laptop (such as: Ableton, Logic Pro, Pro Tools, etc.) and control your favourite plugins. 
 The app allows you to have complete control over the sounds you play. With expansive audio libraries you can choose between traditional or electronic drums, melodic instruments, or any other ‘Odd’ sound under the sun.

 The app has been designed to be super intuitive, so you can focus your time on making your beats. Here are some of the features:
Choose and play sounds from a large sound library. 
Loop, record and overdub your beats. 
Play over your favourite tunes.
Connect multiple balls and assign different sounds. 
Add your own sounds. 
Add sound effects onto your loops. 
Share your tunes with your friends.
Oddball is easily rechargeable by USB. The charging cable is inspired by the iconic jack cables you usually see plugged into famous electric instruments, such as the Fender Stratocaster. 
 Oddball can also be charged on the go with a common USB portable battery pack. 
 
 
 
 The Oddball standard pack comes with one ball and one charging cable delivered in a beautifully crafted box. You also get the app with preloaded sounded libraries and effects for free. 
 
 
  Why not turn the volume up to eleven and pledge for our two, three pack or even six pack.  
 If you are looking for something really special, let your imagination go wild, choose a special finish or custom colour, you name it and we will personally make it for you. Pledge for a bespoke Oddball and we will get in touch to pimp it up for you.  
 
 
 Oddball has a series of sensors at it's heart that are protected by a strong core, that helps withstand the craziest of bounces.  
 
  It has been a long but fulfilling journey to get where we are today, here are just a few picks of the development of the project across the two years.

Genki in the Press

How will you use it? GENKI is the first and only Bluetooth audio transmitter built to the USB Type-C standard.
Fits flush and designed for the Nintendo Switch
Why USB Type-C? There have been some workaround solutions that we’ve tested but none of them were a satisfying solution for the Nintendo Switch. These workarounds introduce extra latency, static noise, lower fidelity and volume and many do not support newer devices such as the Apple AirPods. This led us to create a better solution - through the USB-C port we're able to simply remove the redundant audio conversions providing gamers the best latency and audio quality.
You never know who you’ll meet out there
One of the things we love is detaching the Joy-Cons for an instant transformation into a two-player portable console. But chances are you’re waiting around in a pretty noisy place so one of the coolest features we have is multiplayer support.Where do I insert the quarter into this thing?
With this setup we actually stream stereo audio to two separate headphones, neat huh. So you can better enjoy SnipperClips or Hulu with loved ones.There’s so many awesome indie co-op games on the Switch Cutting the cord prevents accidents like this
Supporting the Bluetooth 5.0 standard, GENKI is compatible with all the Bluetooth headphones out there today (and tomorrow).Apologies this animation of your favorite headphones rotating broke(note this image is of an older prototype without USB-C passthrough) But what if you wanted to unleash the full potential of your Bluetooth speakers? We know those built-in speakers are pretty weak so we got you covered.And did we mention there’s a lot of range? We got more than 60 feet in our field tests but that’s probably further than your Joy-Cons will ever work anyway. Latency matters
If you’ve ever experienced audio where voices don’t seem to synchronize with what you’re watching you know it can be quite distracting. This is even more important in games where your reaction to a sound can mean success and game over.To combat this, we made sure GENKI included the fastest industry leading audio codecs. With aptX Low Latency we can achieve sub 40ms latency. Typically, the human ear can not distinguish below 100ms so rest assured you’ve got the best.
GENKI follows the Nintendo’s USB audio protocol and therefore receives power directly from your Nintendo Switch. But don’t worry, it only draws 0.02 Watts. To get an idea that’s like 1% of your Nintendo Switch’s battery, which is less power than if you had used the built-in speakers.And because a battery isn’t needed, there is absolutely no risk of bricking or damaging your console. And when you're traveling a passthrough PD (power delivery) port allows you to safely charge so that you can keep gaming on-the-go for longer periods of time.
The combo pack comes with three additional accessories:
All in one sleek package
The dock adapter is a simple USB adapter enabling you to use GENKI with your Nintendo Switch docked. Just plug it into any of the three USB ports in the dock; it can even be safely tucked inside the back panel to be hidden.

The portable kickstand is made to support a better tabletop experience when you’re playing on-the-go with friends. Its collapsible and built with a sturdy metal frame. We think we’ve improved on the original built-in kickstand in every way.Portable Stand is a solid upgrade to the built-in kickstandDoesn’t everyone pack Joy-Con steering wheels?We explored three voice chat options since the dawn of Fortnite. Each method had its pros and cons and we found the analog microphone is simple yet efficient. Since your voice is analog it doesn't have to be converted and it can maintain the best quality and latency for quick voice chat responses in portable mode.
  
Option 1 has really bad sound quality and Option 2 made Genki way too big
The microphone gives the best quality without getting in the way Together, we founded Human Things in 2017 on the idea that real objects could be special like those found in video games – you know the ones where you open treasure chests filled with enchanted items that give your character special abilities.It all started with the journey of building the first-ever drone flight academy for Toys”R”Us. Eddie met Chris at innovation consultancy IDEO and at a local makerspace they found Andrew hosting a workshop teaching makers how to make carbon fiber racing drones. The rest is history.

<p>We position our Bluetooth technology and battery in the middle of the tangle free cord. Product testing has proven having the battery and wireless technology hanging off the ear is excessive weight and bounces during movement. Once you try our products you will not want to use other heavier devices. For added stability, you will receive a neckband for the battery pack. Our aluminum case plugs directly into our device.

<br/><h2><b>Stream Any Music Imaginable With Bluetooth</b></h2>
<p>Traditional Bluetooth speakers are great but being waterproof with a built-in rechargeable battery and a microphone, this Bluetooth gadget really is a little phenomenon. Featuring a non-permanent suction cup that mounts onto almost any flat surface, this waterproof speaker can be used on metal, plastics, glass or the guy in front of you in the line at the bank. You can mount this on a variety of surfaces thanks to a strong but gentle grip that holds with ease, leaving your hands free and happy. </p>
<p>Producing great sound, this speaker is perfect to keep the party going wherever

these speakers will blow minds and provide awesome, pumping beats for you to

The shell is made of a two phase polymer blend, ABS plastic; a

rigidity, hardness &amp; heat resistance. The toughness of ABS is the result of
submicroscopically fine polybutadiene rubber particles uniformly distributed in
the SAN matrix.

<p>The main

<p>Due to our thorough testing we are unlikely to encounter any problems. Should something come up, we have the network and know-how to

inventory. Our deadlines are conservative and our priority is to deliver your perks. The plan is to
produce and ship the first 1000 units by mid-December</p>
<p>One of the
things we feel still needs work is the packaging design which we are working on
at this point in time but cannot start producing the new packaging until we
have some additional funds.</p>
<p>As we are far
in the development process, I don't foresee any other risks which we are not
already aware of. We have already overcome a lot of obstacles to get to this
point, such as the necessary certifications required by the law for which we
have already been certified.</p>

We've spent a lot of time and effort setting up our manufacturing and distribution channels before bringing it to Indiegogo and our goal is to produce and have stock by early or mid-December, so we can send your perks to you as quick as possible.
We are a small company and placing large orders is beyond us right now.
This is where you come in!

It would be greatly appreciated if you could please spread the word and contribute to this project. Every dollar contributed counts! 
Go contribute NOW and get your perks!





  Risks & Challenges  
Due to our thorough testing we are unlikely to encounter any problems. Should something come up, we have the network and know-how to
overcome it quickly. Now it comes down to the challenges of cash flow and
inventory. Our deadlines are conservative and our priority is to deliver your perks. The plan is to
produce and ship the first 1000 units by mid-December
One of the
things we feel still needs work is the packaging design which we are working on
at this point in time but cannot start producing the new packaging until we
have some additional funds.
As we are far
in the development process, I don't foresee any other risks which we are not
already aware of. We have already overcome a lot of obstacles to get to this
point, such as the necessary certifications required by the law for which we
have already been certified.
With your
support, we know that this project will truly be a success!
Choose your perk and contribute NOW. Thanks for

We put a lot of time and resources to talk and listen to our users, while and trying to spot the most deep-seated, yet the most original need they have for a wireless headphone. Taking this feedback and thought into consideration, we re-designed and honed our idea to deliver Air by crazybaby ⁽ᴺᴬᴺᴼ⁾  to the market. This new product from crazybaby introduces 10 vibrant colors, while embodying a more compact, simple to use and truly affordable form factor. What we’ve never compromise on is delivering the product that clicks with you the most.</p><p><strong>What’s the difference between Air (NANO) crowdfunding campaign?</strong></p><p>Allen: Crazybaby is a verifiably mature company with the capacity and reputation of delivering products to market. Based on the experience and lessons from the launch, production and delivery of Mars, and Air, we’ve learned from and continuously work to improve our logistics and manufacturing management and operation. To deliver better services and a world-class purchasing experience for the Air (NANO) crowdfunding campaign, we’ve started the pilot production of Air (NANO) two weeks before the launch, so that mass production begins at the same time as the launch. What we are doing is offering a wireless headphone at a truly affordable price point, in a form factor that doesn’t skimp on features found in Air by crazybaby. We hope that in taking this approach, we’re rewarding our backers and the community that’s offered us continuous support in our vision to deliver best-in-class technology to all, as we continue to push the boundaries of personal wireless acoustic devices.</p><p><strong>What have you learned from the Air by crazybaby program?</strong></p><p>Allen: The biggest issue with Air by crazybaby was the unanticipated delay in the product’s shipment schedule. It was mainly because my team and I had been too optimistic in our project cycles, and had to overcome innumerable challenges. However, we finally made it and began shipping Air by crazybaby starting in July of this year. Until today, more than 100,000 units of Air have been shipped globally, and more orders are being shipped. Having learned from our mistakes, we’ve moved up the development and production period for Air (NANO) so that a delay in Air (NANO)’s shipment deadline won’t be a concern anymore.</p><p>A second lesson learned revolved around our poor customer service. As a startup, we’d underestimated the volume of inquiries we’d receive, which meant fewer resources dedicated to customer service and resulted in inefficiencies in our customer service capabilities. However, we’ve recognized the importance of being responsive and value our backer’s and customer’s feedback. Learning from our misstep, we’ve grown our customer service team to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of our communication with our customers. We might not be perfect, but we will never stop improving and evolving.</p><p><strong>What do you want to say to your backers who continuously support crazybaby?</strong></p><p>Allen: Indiegogo and our early backers have not only bred crazybaby, but also witnessed the growth of our brand from the very beginning. All your support and patience are invaluable to this team, which drives us to continually push the envelope. With your support, we’ve once again decided to make our latest product, Air (NANO), available on Indiegogo, with the  hope to hit a new record and join our journey toward revolutionizing the wireless music experience with the help of this amazing community.</p><p><strong>What You Care About, We Also Care for. </strong></p><p>We believe that boldness and innovation is deeply rooted in the DNA of crazybaby, and will carry crazybaby forward. However, we listen and care about every word of encouragement or feedback from you, our backers. The strong bond crazybaby has with Indiegogo and our backers here inspires us to bring the best affordable products to all of you.</p><p>We never stop pushing the boundary of innovation and creativity, by delivering products with best-in-class acoustics and a futuristic aesthetic, centered around the beauty of simplicity and an ergonomic design.

We put a lot of time and resources to talk and listen to our users, while and trying to spot the most deep-seated, yet the most original need they have for a wireless headphone. Taking this feedback and thought into consideration, we re-designed and honed our idea to deliver Air by crazybaby ⁽ᴺᴬᴺᴼ⁾  to the market. This new product from crazybaby introduces 10 vibrant colors, while embodying a more compact, simple to use and truly affordable form factor. What we’ve never compromise on is delivering the product that clicks with you the most.What’s the difference between Air (NANO) crowdfunding campaign?Allen: Crazybaby is a verifiably mature company with the capacity and reputation of delivering products to market. Based on the experience and lessons from the launch, production and delivery of Mars, and Air, we’ve learned from and continuously work to improve our logistics and manufacturing management and operation. To deliver better services and a world-class purchasing experience for the Air (NANO) crowdfunding campaign, we’ve started the pilot production of Air (NANO) two weeks before the launch, so that mass production begins at the same time as the launch. What we are doing is offering a wireless headphone at a truly affordable price point, in a form factor that doesn’t skimp on features found in Air by crazybaby. We hope that in taking this approach, we’re rewarding our backers and the community that’s offered us continuous support in our vision to deliver best-in-class technology to all, as we continue to push the boundaries of personal wireless acoustic devices.What have you learned from the Air by crazybaby program?Allen: The biggest issue with Air by crazybaby was the unanticipated delay in the product’s shipment schedule. It was mainly because my team and I had been too optimistic in our project cycles, and had to overcome innumerable challenges. However, we finally made it and began shipping Air by crazybaby starting in July of this year. Until today, more than 100,000 units of Air have been shipped globally, and more orders are being shipped. Having learned from our mistakes, we’ve moved up the development and production period for Air (NANO) so that a delay in Air (NANO)’s shipment deadline won’t be a concern anymore.A second lesson learned revolved around our poor customer service. As a startup, we’d underestimated the volume of inquiries we’d receive, which meant fewer resources dedicated to customer service and resulted in inefficiencies in our customer service capabilities. However, we’ve recognized the importance of being responsive and value our backer’s and customer’s feedback. Learning from our misstep, we’ve grown our customer service team to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of our communication with our customers. We might not be perfect, but we will never stop improving and evolving.What do you want to say to your backers who continuously support crazybaby?Allen: Indiegogo and our early backers have not only bred crazybaby, but also witnessed the growth of our brand from the very beginning. All your support and patience are invaluable to this team, which drives us to continually push the envelope. With your support, we’ve once again decided to make our latest product, Air (NANO), available on Indiegogo, with the  hope to hit a new record and join our journey toward revolutionizing the wireless music experience with the help of this amazing community.What You Care About, We Also Care for.

However, we listen and care about every word of encouragement or feedback from you, our backers.

hundreds of kids from a variety of backgrounds and ages.  Starting with its debut at the NAMM Show (National Association of Music Merchants), and continuing through Maker’s Faire just last month, as well as many smaller events in between, we’ve witnessed first hand the number of kids who love playing with the Blipblox.  Many kids, even those with no music experience, take to the Blipblox quickly and continue a focused play for an extended period of time.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:quicksand,verdana,sans-serif;""><strong>What age group is the Blipblox target market?</strong><br/>While every kid is different, these are our general observations for what aspects of the Blipblox will attract which age groups:</span></p><p><i><span

style=""font-family:quicksand,verdana,sans-serif;"">Younger kids are attracted to the Blipblox light show and its brightly colored knobs and buttons.  But the most popular controllers are the vibrant red levers.  Many kids love to incorporate the Blipblox into imagination play, so it becomes a spaceship controller or lava flow meter.  We have seen some more musically-oriented kids at this age start to twist the knobs in a more deliberate way and able to get some really cool sounds from the Blipblox.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:quicksand,verdana,sans-serif;""><i>5-8 years</i><br/><span style=""font-family:quicksand,verdana,sans-serif;"">Kids at this age still like the lights and levers, but many are also starting to understand that they are controlling and creating sound.  As kids start to use the Blipblox more, they develop the skills to follow the signal flow lines and connect them to the sound they are hearing.

The manual describes these in detail.How do the control signals work?There 3 modulation sources: LFO1, LFO2 and Modulation Envelope.  Any 3 of these can be routed to Oscillator Modulation 1, Oscillator Modulation 2, and Low Pass Filter Modulation.  This forms a 3x3 modulation matrix. There is also the Amplifier Envelope dedicated to controlling the release time of each note.",12.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<strong>THE </strong>BACKGROUND</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p><strong>Music recording and production is an art that involves a lot of skills</strong></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505390165/ho25rvhqnfnmaqxkhctm.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>In order to create a perfect mix of your song you have to involve different skills such as setting up a whole band, putting microphones in the right positions and distances, adjusting gains, adding effects and mixing all the tracks.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional music recording setup does not allow to capture your creativity</strong></p>
<p>With traditional microphone and recording systems musicians have to spend a lot of time setting up microphones and repeating every take in order to get good quality and balanced final mix. This leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focusing on microphone setup rather than music performing</li>
<li>Losing a good take</li>
<li>Moving a recording session to time consuming recording studios</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 align=""center""><strong>ZYLIA SOLUTION </strong></h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p>The ZYLIA Portable Recording Studio is a combination of a physical microphone ‘ZM-1’ and advanced software processing tools included in ‘ZYLIA Studio’, ‘ZYLIA Studio PRO’ and ‘ZYLIA Ambisonics Converter’.</p>

<h3>ZYLIA VIRTUAL MICROPHONE TECHNOLOGY</h3>
<p>‘Virtual Microphones’ is a spatial audio filtering technique based on advanced ‘beamforming’ and sound source separation algorithms.</p>
<p>A virtual microphone can have different spatial characteristics, width or shape depending on recording use case and user needs and is defined in software taking into account both phase and amplitude differences between signals captured by the 19 capsules in the ZM-1. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h2>
<p><br/><strong>- GENERAL -</strong><br/> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS THE TYPICAL USE CASE?</strong><br/>ZYLIA ZM-1 was designed first and foremost for recording music artists and bands. It drastically simplifies the multitrack recording process and with just a single microphone you can record a performance and afterwards extract/separate the individual instruments/vocals/audio sources from the stereo mix. In addition you can use it for 3D audio production.</p>
<p><u>ZYLIA ZM-1 is an excellent companion for:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Musicians &amp; Bands</li>
<li>Composers and songwriters</li>
<li>Teachers &amp; students in music schools</li>
<li>Jam session lovers</li>
<li>Fans of old fashion one-mic-recording</li>
<li>Sound designers/recordists fascinated with ambient &amp; ambisonics recording (<strong>3rd order Ambisonics</strong>)</li>
<li>3D / Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality creators</li>
<li>360˚ movie production companies<br/> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CAN I USE ZYLIA PORTABLE RECORDING STUDIO TOGETHER WITH MY DAW?</strong><br/>Yes, ZYLIA ZM-1 is compatible with all DAWs currently on the market. The microphone is visible as a 19 channel source input device. In addition, separated tracks of audio sources and instruments can be exported directly into any DAW of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>DO I GET A WARRANTY?</strong><br/>ZYLIA's hardware products are covered with warranty against defects in materials and workmanship - under normal use - for a period of ONE (1) YEAR from the date of purchase by the original end-user / purchaser.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>- USE CASES -</strong><br/> </p>
<p><strong>WOULD THE ZYLIA ZM-1 WORK WITHIN LARGE VENUES?</strong><br/>ZYLIA ZM-1 was designed to work in a huge variety of environments - from living rooms and home studios to rehearsal rooms and larger venues.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>COULD IT BE USED FOR RECORDING MULTIPLE VOICES IN VIDEO PRODUCTION?</strong>Absolutely! the ZM-1 can be used for recording many speakers/voice actors simultaneously. At the output you would get a stereo, binaural or 19 channels recording and after processing, a separate audio track of each speaker/voice actor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CAN I USE ZYLIA AS A REGULAR MICROPHONE WITHOUT ZYLIA STUDIO SOFTWARE?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can. From operating system point of view, ZYLIA ZM-1 is visible as a 19 track audio interface. Therefore. you can treat it as a typical USB microphone with additional benefit of high quality microphone capsules.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>MAY I USE ZYLIA FOR AS A LIVE SOUND MICROPHONE?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can. During the live performance you have several options. First, use ZYLIA as a USB microphone. Second, you can record a 3D audio in a binaural way. Third, by using a ZYLIA Studio PRO you can use a virtual microphone technology and pass only selected sounds to PA system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CAN I USE ZYLIA FOR LIVE RECORDING?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can output from virtual microphones to create a surround sound, binaural or just a stereo recording. The beuty of ZYLIA is that you can make this decision AFTER the recording due to 360 format that we use - you can separate or filter sounds using ZYLIA Studio or ZYLIA Studio PRO software.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>- TECHNICAL -</strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW DOES ZYLIA STUDIO EXTRACT MULTIPLE INSTRUMENTS FROM A SINGLE MIC REC?</strong><br/>The technology behind 'extraction of sound sources' is a technique developed by our internal R&amp;D department. We use a combination of spatial filtering (beamforming) and blind sound source separation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CAN I CONTROL THE LEVEL OF SEPARATION?</strong><br/>Yes, you have two options included in 'ZYLIA Studio' related to virtual microphones.</p>
<p>Preset no.1 : filters and cut a specific section of the 3D sound preserving the ambience and room acoustic.</p>
<p>Preset no.2 : takes into account the localization of interfered sources which leads to removing unwanted noises and ambience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CAN YOU DO LIVE MONITORING OF THE RECORDING?</strong><br/>Sure, we found this a must-have in order to achieve an optimal work-flow. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE RECORDING SPECIFICATIONS?</strong><br/>The current version of ZYLIA ZM-1 has 19 built-in microphones - or microphone capsules to be exact. The system records 19 tracks from these physical microphone capsules + an arbitrary number of 'virtual microphones' defined in the ZYLIA Studio software by the user. Each virtual microphone is recorded as a separate track. Audio is recorded in 48 kHz/24 bit quality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE VIRTUAL MICROPHONES?</strong><br/>These are software defined microphone beams that can be directed in any position in the 3D space. ZYLIA ZM-1 can detect audio sources within 3D space and steer appropriate virtual microphone beams towards them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW MANY TRACKS OF SEPARATED AUDIO CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM A RECORDING?</strong><br/>To obtain a decent separation of sound sources there should be 6-8 of them located around a microphone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CAN YOU DO 5.1/7.1/22.2 AUDIO RECORDINGS WITH ZYLIA?</strong><br/>Thanks to our 'virtual microphone technology' it is possible to set microphone beams in many directions simultaneously! In this way you can record in mono, stereo, 5.1, 7.1 or any other arrangement you might need. You can also define your own setups. Moreover, it is possible to do a binaural recording.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CAN I USE ZYLIA WITHOUT INTERNET CONNECTION?</strong><br/>Yes, it does its magic perfectly without being online.</p>

THE BACKGROUND
 
Music recording and production is an art that involves a lot of skills

In order to create a perfect mix of your song you have to involve different skills such as setting up a whole band, putting microphones in the right positions and distances, adjusting gains, adding effects and mixing all the tracks.
Traditional music recording setup does not allow to capture your creativity
With traditional microphone and recording systems musicians have to spend a lot of time setting up microphones and repeating every take in order to get good quality and balanced final mix. This leads to:

Focusing on microphone setup rather than music performing
Losing a good take
Moving a recording session to time consuming recording studios

 
ZYLIA SOLUTION 
 
The ZYLIA Portable Recording Studio is a combination of a physical microphone ‘ZM-1’ and advanced software processing tools included in ‘ZYLIA Studio’, ‘ZYLIA Studio PRO’ and ‘ZYLIA Ambisonics Converter’.

The beuty of ZYLIA is that you can make this decision AFTER the recording due to 360 format that we use - you can separate or filter sounds using ZYLIA Studio or ZYLIA Studio PRO software.
 
- TECHNICAL -
HOW DOES ZYLIA STUDIO EXTRACT MULTIPLE INSTRUMENTS FROM A SINGLE MIC REC?The technology behind 'extraction of sound sources' is a technique developed by our internal R&D department. We use a combination of spatial filtering (beamforming) and blind sound source separation.
 
CAN I CONTROL THE LEVEL OF SEPARATION?Yes, you have two options included in 'ZYLIA Studio' related to virtual microphones.
Preset no.1 : filters and cut a specific section of the 3D sound preserving the ambience and room acoustic.
Preset no.2 : takes into account the localization of interfered sources which leads to removing unwanted noises and ambience.
 
CAN YOU DO LIVE MONITORING OF THE RECORDING?Sure, we found this a must-have in order to achieve an optimal work-flow. 
 
WHAT ARE THE RECORDING SPECIFICATIONS?The current version of ZYLIA ZM-1 has 19 built-in microphones - or microphone capsules to be exact. The system records 19 tracks from these physical microphone capsules + an arbitrary number of 'virtual microphones' defined in the ZYLIA Studio software by the user. Each virtual microphone is recorded as a separate track. Audio is recorded in 48 kHz/24 bit quality.
 
WHAT ARE VIRTUAL MICROPHONES?These are software defined microphone beams that can be directed in any position in the 3D space. ZYLIA ZM-1 can detect audio sources within 3D space and steer appropriate virtual microphone beams towards them.
 
HOW MANY TRACKS OF SEPARATED AUDIO CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM A RECORDING?To obtain a decent separation of sound sources there should be 6-8 of them located around a microphone.
 
CAN YOU DO 5.1/7.1/22.2 AUDIO RECORDINGS WITH ZYLIA?Thanks to our 'virtual microphone technology' it is possible to set microphone beams in many directions simultaneously! In this way you can record in mono, stereo, 5.1, 7.1 or any other arrangement you might need. You can also define your own setups. Moreover, it is possible to do a binaural recording.
 
CAN I USE ZYLIA WITHOUT INTERNET CONNECTION?Yes, it does its magic perfectly without being online.

It combines the convenience of a single box design with the full-range powerful sound of a big HiFi stereo system. With deepblue2 you'll experience irresistible sound that you can easily move from room to room.In 2013 Peachtree Audio launched the original deepblue. It received rave reviews from the media and customers alike and quickly established itself as the answer to the question ""What's the best sounding Bluetooth speaker I can buy today?"" Scot Hull theabsolutesound.com ""...the little deepblue system suddenly pounded out some shockingly deep bass... I’m still flabbergasted.""Chris Connaker computeraudiophile.com ""No matter what music I put through deepblue I was impressed by the sound quality. deepblue produces sound that's far larger than its physical size...""Michael Mercer thedailyswarm.com ""I don't know how Peachtree got this bass, but its damn impressive.

It plays loud enough to fill my entire 2,220 square-foot house with sound. It hits 102dB at one meter with my usual ""Kickstart My Heart"" test - that's 5 to 10dB more than usual, which is a lot.""  Raising the performance bar  With deepblue2 our design team has committed to raise the performance bar even higher. The technical challenge is to get controlled, deep and loud bass extension out of a small cabinet - and to do that without a wallet devastating price tag. Most wireless speakers use two or three small speaker drivers operating at their maximum potential to try to achieve full range sound. The result is thin and compressed sound that is fatiguing to listen to at high volumes. They simply run out of gas. For truly life-like sound you need a speaker capable of producing deep bass and the only way to do that is to move lots of air. You need to have the right combination of power, surface area, driver excursion and correct enclosure all working together. We're not breaking the laws of physics. We're exploiting them to make the biggest sounding Bluetooth speaker ever made.  deepblue2 uses a custom developed 440-watt amplifier that is 5X more powerful than the home Bluetooth speakers currently on the market.A massive long excursion 6.5-inch woofer moves a serious amount of air and creates deep impactful bass. You not only hear full bass, you feel it. deepblue2 uses a total of five speakers in a three-way configuration to create a powerful balanced sound so every instrument and voice can be easily heard. Two 3"" mid-range drivers and two 1"" soft-dome tweeters flank deepblue2's woofer to create a wide natural sound that fills an entire room.   A very carefully designed acoustic suspension enclosure separates deepblue2 from everything else on the market. Our sealed box approach outperforms the typical ported box and passive radiator designs by creating clean deep bass that doesn't distort at high volume.  aptX® Bluetooth audio streaming    Stream all of your favorite music and apps to deepblue using its built-in aptX® Bluetooth audio receiver. You can pair your Android, iPhone, iPod touch, Macbook and most PCs for high quality wireless audio streaming. With Bluetooth you don’t need any proprietary apps - you can use the ones you already love and are familiar with. iTunes, Windows Media, Pandora, Spotify, LastFM, just to mention a few, are easily streamed wirelessly.  Digital and analog inputs deepblue2 features two wired inputs: one optical and one 3.5mm analog. Want to connect an Apple TV or Amazon Fire TV? No problem. Sonos Connect? Ditto. Dig vinyl? You can do that too by using a turntable with a built-in or external phono preamp. deepblue2's optical digital input even accepts high-resolution 24/96 digital audio for better-than-CD-quality sound. If your HDTV has an optical digital output (most do) you can even use deepblue2 to listen to TV, movies and games! Awesome.  Play in any room at any volume Play it low or play it loudThe human ear is less senstive to bass frequencies at low volume. Smart Volume automatically adjusts frequency response at the low end of the volume range to compensate for the ear's lower sensitivity. This means you get full and clear sound even at very low volumes.For those times you need to let loose and turn up the volume to party level, Smart Volume will lower peak signals when playing at high volume to ensure great distortion-free sound and the long lasting performance of your deepblue2.Perfect sound in any roomdeepblue2 is voiced out of the box to produce the most balanced bass response in the places where it'll be most commonly placed. However, it's impossible to predict every situation where a speaker is going to be located. You may also prefer more or less bass.

Bluetooth works with iOS, Android, Windows and Mac OS X.We also chose it for its simplicity. Bluetooth is a point A to point B connection. That means no router or proprietary network with complex setup is needed.We also considered the cost and go-to-market timeline. Bluetooth itself is relatively easy and affordable to implement which allowed us to spend more money and time on the sound quality of deepblue2.If you'd like to add Airplay capability we suggest connecting either an Apple TV or Airport Express to one of deepblue2's optical or analog inputs.What is its wireless range?Bluetooth has a range of 10 meters (33 feet) open air. Distance will vary with walls and your device’s capability.Can I connect to more than one deepblue2 at a time - for example, stream from one phone to multiple deepblue2s?You can connect to one deepblue2 at a time.",23.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<h3>The motivation behind Boxie<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>    This project arose from the frustration that came with trying to find
 a speaker which lit up the room with music.  Few exist on the market 
today, and all have poor light synchronization with the audio.  Boxie 
changes this by providing the best digital processing available, in an 
elegant package, and at an affordable price.</p>
<p>    Boxie works with all 
genres of music, and gives you the illusion that the speaker is feeling 
the emotion behind the song.  Boxie reacts to tempo, cadence, and 
patterns the same way that your ears and brain do.</p>
<p>    All that is 
needed to get going is the Boxie speaker, any audio source with a 
standard 3.5mm aux cable, and power.  Boxie was designed to be a desktop
 or bookshelf speaker, not a portable speaker, so there are no batteries
 or Bluetooth connections to deal with.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Why Boxie needs your help<br/>
</h3> <p>    For Boxie to become available to the general consumer, funding needs to be raised so that components can be bought in bulk orders to keep costs low (each LED can be acquired for less than a 1/4th of the price if they are all purchased at once for many orders).  The prototype Boxie can be replicated and distributed at just shy of $200, but with crowdfunding, Boxie can be refined and distributed for less than 75% of that.<br/></p>

 Why choose Wearbuds™?  
 
 
-Jun 29, 2019 Published on YouTube channel randomfrankp: Cool Tech Under $100!
 Most true wireless earbuds have very limited battery life and can't be taken too far from their bulky charging case. No matter how compact the buds are, your pocket is always going to be bulging with the case. 
 With Wearbuds™, everything you need is right on your wrist, and you can charge your earbuds even while jogging, cycling, or hiking. When you want to listen to music there's no need to dig around in your pocket or backpack, the buds are already at your fingertips.

We believe everyone with ears to hear should listen to their music at its best. So, each of our earpieces contains two balanced armature drivers, one dedicated and tuned as a tweeter and one as a woofer. The drivers are fed your music through a device called a crossover that separates the high and low sounds in your music allowing the earphone to produce both spectrums of sound to you in perfect cohesion.</p><p><b><em style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Most headphones are tuned to highlight the bass or to sound flat.</em><em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""> </em></b></p><p>What if your music could come alive? </p><p>LIFE headphones are precision tuned to present your music dynamically, highlighting the parts of music your ears crave the most. With a slightly U-shaped tuning, LIFE places a slight emphasis on the bass and treble. The result is a warm, lively sound that energizes your music. With a slight de-emphasis on the mid range, LIFE can be listened to for extended periods of time (like running a marathon) without the listener fatigue you would experience from other headphones.</p><p></p><p><b>Most headphones don't create a realistic soundstage.</b></p><p> LIFE's sensitive audio technology, curved construction, and sound isolation combine to create a listening experience that transports you into an authentic sonic environment, giving extra dimension to your music.</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""-Keanex, headphone reviewer and blogger, Reddit and Headfi.com"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/169/380/33b2bd1ab1a00cef44fc184864ac2302_original.png?v=1437194583&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=57cae23951b92ecad39aae2611bdaca7"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/life-the-first-audiophile-exercise-headphone/edit/www.head-fi.org/t/775430/review-life-acoustics-iems"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>-Keanex, headphone reviewer and blogger, Reddit and Headfi.com</i></a></figcaption><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><br/></figcaption></figure><div>

<p>As a social business, LIFE Acoustics is on a mission to help the 100,000+ deaf children living in poverty. Without hearing aids, many of these children can't hear well enough to go to school, much less enjoy the simple pleasures of music. By partnering with organizations like <a href=""http://www.lifeacoustics.com/#!help-me-hear/c13mv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ayúdame a Escuchar</a> (Help Me Hear), we want to give hearing to as many deaf children living in poverty as we can.</p>
<p>Through our relationship with Help Me Hear, we have learned that many charitable organizations who donate hearing aids ignore the fact that the recipients of those hearing aids often cannot afford to buy the batteries needed to continue to power them.</p>
<p>Our solution to this problem lies in harnessing the sun to charge the batteries hearing aids run on. We can give children a long term, environmentally sustainable solution to their hearing impairment by sourcing solar chargers from an award winning social business called <a href=""http://www.solarear.com.br/solar/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Solar Ears</a> and donating them along with hearing aids to deaf children living in poverty.</p>

Social Business:
We want LIFE to do more than just enhance your relationship with music, so we paired our headphones with a purpose: to change the lives of deaf children living in poverty by giving them solar powered hearing aids. This campaign will help us launch our first product, the LIFE headphone, graduating our company from a startup to a full fledged social business! Read more below.


So far! More to come. Links to articles and reviews.-David Freeburg, avid runner and blogger for MinneapolisRunning.com Using a patented design shaped like the crevices in your ear, LIFE anchors itself comfortably for long term active use. Four parts of your ear are harnessed to varying degrees, based on the size and shape of your ear, to hold LIFE in place:1 - The Top of your ear holds the custom shaped cord end and directs cord tension so that the earpiece is pulled forwards rather than out.2 - The Helix hooks around the tail of the earpiece and keeps it from twisting3 - The Crevice hugs the body of the earpiece and holds it close to your head4 - The Canal holds the ear bud firmlyThe LIFE headphone replaces the need for a custom earpiece and fits so securely and comfortably that it is perfect for use in all activities, including running, dancing, or lifting weights.-Dave Ford, audiophile and LIFE beta testerLIFE headphones do what other headphones don't:Most headphones aren't capable of producing your music's nuances. LIFE's sound technology is normally reserved for the in-ear monitors professional musicians wear on stage. We believe everyone with ears to hear should listen to their music at its best. So, each of our earpieces contains two balanced armature drivers, one dedicated and tuned as a tweeter and one as a woofer. The drivers are fed your music through a device called a crossover that separates the high and low sounds in your music allowing the earphone to produce both spectrums of sound to you in perfect cohesion.Most headphones are tuned to highlight the bass or to sound flat. What if your music could come alive? LIFE headphones are precision tuned to present your music dynamically, highlighting the parts of music your ears crave the most. With a slightly U-shaped tuning, LIFE places a slight emphasis on the bass and treble. The result is a warm, lively sound that energizes your music. With a slight de-emphasis on the mid range, LIFE can be listened to for extended periods of time (like running a marathon) without the listener fatigue you would experience from other headphones.Most headphones don't create a realistic soundstage. LIFE's sensitive audio technology, curved construction, and sound isolation combine to create a listening experience that transports you into an authentic sonic environment, giving extra dimension to your music.-Keanex, headphone reviewer and blogger, Reddit and Headfi.com

As a social business, LIFE Acoustics is on a mission to help the 100,000+ deaf children living in poverty. Without hearing aids, many of these children can't hear well enough to go to school, much less enjoy the simple pleasures of music. By partnering with organizations like Ayúdame a Escuchar (Help Me Hear), we want to give hearing to as many deaf children living in poverty as we can.
Through our relationship with Help Me Hear, we have learned that many charitable organizations who donate hearing aids ignore the fact that the recipients of those hearing aids often cannot afford to buy the batteries needed to continue to power them.
Our solution to this problem lies in harnessing the sun to charge the batteries hearing aids run on. We can give children a long term, environmentally sustainable solution to their hearing impairment by sourcing solar chargers from an award winning social business called Solar Ears and donating them along with hearing aids to deaf children living in poverty.

Before then, I had started writing poetry as a way to deal with my hardships; I was starting to get more into music and I was looking for artists like me. Artists that had grown up in a broken home, artists who were able to rise from it and openly speak about their pasts. In the dark hours of the night, those were the people who got me through it. Now, I want to be that artist for someone else. I have written 5 tracks that I feel combine strong melodies, interesting chord progressions, potent lyrics, and most importantly have a message of empowerment but I need your help to make them sound as great as possible. I am currently a student at the University of Miami's Frost School of Music with a major in Musicianship, Artistry Development, and Entrepreneurship and a minor in both Music Business and Creative American Music (fancy name for songwriting).  While I do work part-time at school, it's not enough to cover all the finances that go into creating an EP. In order to pay the musicians, the producer, the sound engineer, and the cover art artist, I need all the help I can get.  By donating to this project, you are not only supporting independent artists but students as well.

LDAC maintains maximum bit depth and a frequency range of 96kHz/24-bit during transmission and is capable of high compression efficiency and reproduction.Unlike any other Bluetooth® compatible encoding technology, LDAC allows you to listen to high-resolution audio content in exceptional sound quality, transmitting at a maximum transfer rate of 990 kbps. This is approximately two times the data available with Qualcomm® aptX™ HD and three times the data available with Bluetooth® compatible audio technology (SBC).LDAC supports different transmission frequencies, depending on the wireless environment, providing the optimized listening experience that music lovers seek and which artists want to produce. It is literally the best wireless sound you can get for your lossless high-resolution audio library and comes close to matching the capability of Tidal Hi-Fi MQA.With Android Oreo 8.0, Sony's LDAC codec has been integrated into the Bluetooth stack and users can pick their preferred Bluetooth codec. amplify uses the high-quality Qualcomm aptX HD technology, which is the high definition version of the original aptX classic audio codec.aptX HD is an enhanced audio codec that allows you to receive 48KHz/24bit audio via Bluetooth and has been engineered to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in lower background noise. This improved technology helps listeners to hear even the smallest details in their music and is designed to provide realistic audio quality that is hard to distinguish from the actual live sound. Featuring support for transmitting 24-bit audio over Bluetooth with aptX HD along with external Hi-Fi DAC with an amplifier that reproduces high-quality sound up to 384KHz/32bit, amplify has the capability of delivering high-res sound that is much closer to analog sound even through Bluetooth.  Designed to reproduce high-fidelity audio, amplify is equipped with the advanced 384KHz/32bit AKM AK4376 Digital-Analogue Converter (DAC) with an integrated headphone amplifier. With an impressively high 125dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low distortion, amplify delivers sound quality generally heard only in more expensive DAC's.  The integrated high-performance headphone amplifier is designed for driving the most demanding of headphones and will satisfy even the most demanding headphone enthusiast with its high output and revealing sound.amplify is designed with a “driving” concept that focuses on boosting weak signals, so it doesn’t get caught out when powering high-impedance headphones.   Designed for a seamless experience to complement the technology you use every day. amplify supports voice calls and features a built-in microphone that enables you to receive calls when using your normal wired headphones without a microphone.  Equipped with a 300mAh rechargeable lithium polymer battery, amplify will give you up to 12 hours of playtime so you can enjoy your music on the go for longer.   With a micro USB charging cable, amplify can easily be connected to a power source and recharged in 3 hours – well in time for its next adventure. Sync two amplify’s together and share your favorite song with your bestie. Enjoy the same music in hi-res audio with separate headphones/earphones.amplify is the perfect way to get great-sounding wireless audio not only from your smartphone to headphones but also from your smartphone to any audio system.  Encased in premium anodized aluminum housing, the compact and lightweight amplify is designed for optimum portability, comfort and durability.      At Auris, our philosophy is about empowering our innovative creative streak to enhance user experience. Team Auris wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for backers like you who not only kick-started our first product but have continued to support us through the years.We are a team of friends, designers, engineers, audio geeks, and operations experts bound together with one sole purpose in mind: creating audio solutions that simplify and enhance modern lifestyle.Our team at Auris has extensive experience in design, electronics, manufacturing and supply chain.

<p>Hi Indiegogo, we’re PUMP Audio.</p>
<p>In 2014 we came in to existence thanks to the power of Crowdfunding with ""PUMP In-Ear"".</p>
<p>They sounded like <u>no other</u> headphones on the planet, and were especially appreciated by people who love Electronic and Dance music, due to their incredible Bass Response.</p>
<p>Since then, we’ve gone from strength to strength, having received <a href=""http://pump-audio.com/what-people-are-saying/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hundreds of official 5 star reviews</a>, and <i>thousands</i> of unofficial ones from users in 59 countries around the world.</p>

<p><i>MIX Wireless</i> is our latest in ear headphone design.</p>
<p><strong>It gives you the revolutionary PUMP Audio sound signature, in Wireless Bluetooth</strong>.</p>
<p>Unlike many new headphone innovations that appear on crowdfunding sites, which often focus on a gimmic or new technological idea, PUMP Audio headphones are all about <u>one thing</u>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477350706/wsr0tr5an8okgdw4zajq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>At PUMP Audio, we <u>truly</u> believe that <strong>sound</strong> is by far the most important element in any set of headphones. So much so that it's our official company slogan.</p>
<p>After sound comes <strong>comfort</strong>, <strong>usability </strong>and <strong>style </strong>in that order, with manufacturing quality a given.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478212583/g4uurlwqod7qbx6nyvid.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>The sub-bass reproduction and unique sound signature of MIX Wireless is something that we’ve developed from the ground up over the course of over two years, and it’s something we’re <u>very</u> proud of.</p>
<p><strong>The obvious difference between PUMP Audio headphones and other brands is the <u>quality</u> and <u>depth</u> of the bass and sub-bass reproduction.</strong></p>
<p>There have been some other brands who have tried this approach, including a very famous one you are no doubt familiar with beginning with a ""b""...</p>
<p>However, the <i>other </i>big difference between PUMP Audio and those other brands is what we've done with <i>the rest</i> of the frequency range.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479531732/m3ptndn8djmm4juk61gu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We haven't simply sacrificed the rest of the range so that all you hear is heavy bass.</p>
<p>Instead we've painstakingly created a totally unique sound signature that gives you <i>immense</i> bass, but with balance, clarity, and high fidelity Audiophile quality sound through the entire range.</p>

<p>We started by creating Amazing Bass™, and then tuned the mids and highs to what we think is perfection.</p>
<p>With many top-end headphones, you have to turn the volume up very high to really get the bass you want, because they give the mid range a lot of priority.</p>
<p>And when you do that, the highs become too harsh (for Electronic music in particular).</p>
<p>We tuned PUMP <i>specifically</i> for lovers of Electronic and Dance music, although they sound pretty incredible with ALL genres according to our Artist and User reviews.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479189785/e3jzaii4rxdtsivefipy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Bluetooth chip in MIX Wireless is is an <strong>all new</strong> exclusive chip we developed together with ISSC Technologies.</p>

<p>We couldn't achieve perfect replication of the PUMP sound signature with the off the shelf CSR chipset we started out with, which led us early on in development to switch to developing a custom chip exclusively for MIX Wireless.</p>

<div> </div>
<div>We decided early on in development to go against the recent trend of ""true wireless"" headphones.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Indeed, back in April 2016 we had communication from Darren F (a DJ), who was a <i>Bragi Dash</i> ""true wireless"" backer on Kickstarter, and subsequently became an Investor in PUMP Audio.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><i>(This email is from <u>before</u> Darren became an Investor)</i></div>
<p><i>----------------------------------------</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479092019/jvgnnctyczcmkbjuqxsv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>""I am returning my Bragi Dash today of which I was part of the kick-starter Group due to their disappointing sound quality! It is the most important feature of any sound producing device with wireless being a close second now"". And I feel like you have nailed both I am eagerly awaiting your wireless launch""</strong></i></p>
<strong><i>""in my opinion they have overstretched sacrificing volume and sound quality for whistles and bells. True quality sound with sufficient volume seems to be lacking throughout the wireless market at present. The others all seem to be blaming a mixture of Bluetooth capabilities and regulatory restrictions for their failings. Your demo model at GSL""</i></strong><strong><i> </i></strong>(Gadget Show Live, April 2016)<strong> <i>""seemed to have overcome these issues.""</i></strong><p><br/><i>- Darren (PUMP User and Investor)</i></p>
<p><i>----------------------------------------</i></p>
<p>Darren accurately identified the issues of reproducing the ""PUMP Sound"" accurately via Bluetooth, which -- through <i>months</i> of development -- we were able to overcome.</p>
<p>The other main reason we decided to go with Wireless rather than ""true wireless"" was that we think that current ""true wireless"" headphones are too easy to lose and in some cases can also pose a choking hazard for small children.</p>
<p>In fact since the launch of Apples ""Airpods"" there has been something of a backlash on social media. There has even been at least one company spring up who offer to convert Airpods to ""Wireless"" from ""True Wireless"":</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479088800/ibp8qj4ern12lnrpdx9u.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This trend appears to give validation to our view that Wireless earphones are the way to go, and indeed part of the reason for offering the 90 day trial is to prove this to Indiegogo backers who are tempted by the recent trend of pure wireless.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479250864/wvksmbr4to5eouwedpey.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>MIX Wireless comes with 2 sizes of silicone eartips, and 3 sizes of Memory Foam eartips:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477341055/ve9uqdex4mcxzpbq9bbg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Each set has been <u>specifically designed</u> to work with the internal architecture of MIX Wireless to ensure they sound the same, no matter what size ear canal you have.</p>
<p>It's not just a case of choosing any old eartips, as this can <i>ruin</i> the sound quality!</p>
<p>It's really important to choose <strong>the right</strong> eartips for your ears, otherwise your PUMPs won't sound <i>quite right</i> and you may start to wonder what all the fuss is about…</p>

Hi Indiegogo, we’re PUMP Audio.
In 2014 we came in to existence thanks to the power of Crowdfunding with ""PUMP In-Ear"".
They sounded like no other headphones on the planet, and were especially appreciated by people who love Electronic and Dance music, due to their incredible Bass Response.
Since then, we’ve gone from strength to strength, having received hundreds of official 5 star reviews, and thousands of unofficial ones from users in 59 countries around the world.



MIX Wireless is our latest in ear headphone design.
It gives you the revolutionary PUMP Audio sound signature, in Wireless Bluetooth.
Unlike many new headphone innovations that appear on crowdfunding sites, which often focus on a gimmic or new technological idea, PUMP Audio headphones are all about one thing:

At PUMP Audio, we truly believe that sound is by far the most important element in any set of headphones. So much so that it's our official company slogan.
After sound comes comfort, usability and style in that order, with manufacturing quality a given.



The sub-bass reproduction and unique sound signature of MIX Wireless is something that we’ve developed from the ground up over the course of over two years, and it’s something we’re very proud of.
The obvious difference between PUMP Audio headphones and other brands is the quality and depth of the bass and sub-bass reproduction.
There have been some other brands who have tried this approach, including a very famous one you are no doubt familiar with beginning with a ""b""...
However, the other big difference between PUMP Audio and those other brands is what we've done with the rest of the frequency range.

We haven't simply sacrificed the rest of the range so that all you hear is heavy bass.
Instead we've painstakingly created a totally unique sound signature that gives you immense bass, but with balance, clarity, and high fidelity Audiophile quality sound through the entire range.


PUMP Audio vs Beats:74% preferred PUMP / 26% preferred Beats.Models tested: PUMP IEM V1 vs Beats Tour

PUMP Audio vs BOSE:89% preferred PUMP / 11% preferred BOSE.Models tested: PUMP Zeus vs BOSE QC15 and BOSE QC25

PUMP Audio vs Sennheiser:85% preferred PUMP / 15% preferred Sennheiser.Models tested: PUMP Pure vs Sennheiser Momentum On-Ear

PUMP Audio vs SoundMAGIC:95% preferred PUMP / 5% preferred SoundMAGIC.Models tested: PUMP IEM V2 vs SoundMAGIC E50S
PUMP Audio vs SMS Audio:96% preferred PUMP / 4% preferred SMS Audio.Models tested: PUMP Zeus vs SMS Audio Street by 50 over ear
Full results and methodology at:http://pump-audio.com/blindfold-test-results/
In fact we’re so confident in the immense sound they produce that we’ve decided to offer a 90 day trial to all Indiegogo Backers who order during the launch campaign (see the bottom of this campaign page for full offer and terms).

They sound just like ""PUMP V2"" -- our much loved wired in-ear headphones -- unless you have extremely sensitive ears, in which case you might notice the even wider frequency response range, which is now 12hz – 28Khz.
PUMP Audio headphones all have a sound signature that's totally unique.
No other headphones on the planet sound quite like them.

We started by creating Amazing Bass™, and then tuned the mids and highs to what we think is perfection.
With many top-end headphones, you have to turn the volume up very high to really get the bass you want, because they give the mid range a lot of priority.
And when you do that, the highs become too harsh (for Electronic music in particular).
We tuned PUMP specifically for lovers of Electronic and Dance music, although they sound pretty incredible with ALL genres according to our Artist and User reviews.

Many more Artist reviews can be seen at:http://pump-audio.com/artist-endorsements/
Here's a video of our Founder Adam Blair talking about the PUMP Audio Sound Signature and what genres of music our Friends have been listening to on them...



The Bluetooth chip in MIX Wireless is is an all new exclusive chip we developed together with ISSC Technologies.

We couldn't achieve perfect replication of the PUMP sound signature with the off the shelf CSR chipset we started out with, which led us early on in development to switch to developing a custom chip exclusively for MIX Wireless.
Our new chip (which we're calling the ""BR1"" chip) connects quickly, has extremely reliable connection and crucially, can handle the bass and sub bass reproduction we needed, as well as having perfect reproduction through the rest of the range.

 

 
We decided early on in development to go against the recent trend of ""true wireless"" headphones.
 
Indeed, back in April 2016 we had communication from Darren F (a DJ), who was a Bragi Dash ""true wireless"" backer on Kickstarter, and subsequently became an Investor in PUMP Audio.
 
(This email is from before Darren became an Investor)
----------------------------------------

""I am returning my Bragi Dash today of which I was part of the kick-starter Group due to their disappointing sound quality! It is the most important feature of any sound producing device with wireless being a close second now"". And I feel like you have nailed both I am eagerly awaiting your wireless launch""
""in my opinion they have overstretched sacrificing volume and sound quality for whistles and bells. True quality sound with sufficient volume seems to be lacking throughout the wireless market at present. The others all seem to be blaming a mixture of Bluetooth capabilities and regulatory restrictions for their failings. Your demo model at GSL"" (Gadget Show Live, April 2016) ""seemed to have overcome these issues.""- Darren (PUMP User and Investor)
----------------------------------------
Darren accurately identified the issues of reproducing the ""PUMP Sound"" accurately via Bluetooth, which -- through months of development -- we were able to overcome.
The other main reason we decided to go with Wireless rather than ""true wireless"" was that we think that current ""true wireless"" headphones are too easy to lose and in some cases can also pose a choking hazard for small children.
In fact since the launch of Apples ""Airpods"" there has been something of a backlash on social media. There has even been at least one company spring up who offer to convert Airpods to ""Wireless"" from ""True Wireless"":

This trend appears to give validation to our view that Wireless earphones are the way to go, and indeed part of the reason for offering the 90 day trial is to prove this to Indiegogo backers who are tempted by the recent trend of pure wireless.

MIX Wireless comes with 2 sizes of silicone eartips, and 3 sizes of Memory Foam eartips:

Each set has been specifically designed to work with the internal architecture of MIX Wireless to ensure they sound the same, no matter what size ear canal you have.
It's not just a case of choosing any old eartips, as this can ruin the sound quality!
It's really important to choose the right eartips for your ears, otherwise your PUMPs won't sound quite right and you may start to wonder what all the fuss is about…

We suggest trying all five earbud sizes to see which ones best fit your ear size. Using the best size for your ear makes a BIG difference!


Answering or hanging up on a call is as simple as pressing the centre button.

Your music will automatically fade out when you receive a call and if you're not available to talk, just hold the Centre button down for a couple of seconds and your music will be instantly resumed!
To redial your last number, press the Centre button twice;
To cancel a call, press the Centre button and that will cancel the call;
To decline a call, hold the Centre button down for a couple of seconds.
It all becomes second nature after a very short time.

We’ve designed MIX Wireless to be perfect for the gym – no more cables waving around and unlike some so called “true wireless” headphones, they stay in your ears due to the seal they form in your ear when the correct earbud size is used, and the incredibly light weight.


The battery and control module are tiny, weighing at just 3.6g (making a total weight of just 11g!) but will last for 4 hours+ constant use (dependant on volume)between charges.




You can get your MIX Wireless in our signature PUMP Orange:
Or in the slightly more understated Jet Black:

Both colour options come with machined aluminium casing:



If you damage or break your PUMPs, fear not… We definitely don’t want to leave you in the lurch just because you had an accident or lent them to someone who’s a bit too heavy handed.
That’s why we offer PUMPreplace.

Just get in touch with a copy of your receipt and a picture of your damaged PUMPs and we’ll arrange another set for you (minus the packaging, accessories, manuals etc. that you already have) at a heavily subsidised price.
This price may change a little from time to time, but it will always be a fraction of the “new” price, so just ask us what it is currently.
Your 5 Year PUMPreplace Warranty does not effect your standard PUMP 2 Year full product warranty.
 * you must register your Warranty on at pump-audio.com to be eligible (it’s free!).

We appreciate that there are some pretty major claims made about the sound quality of MIX Wireless in this Launch campaign.
If you are already a Friend of PUMP then you will know that these claims are no exaggeration.
However, if you're new to the PUMP Family we understand that there may be some scepticism; after all, how different can one set of headphones sound from another?
Well the answer is a LOT (as you will see from our Artist Reviews and User Reviews), and to prove that to you, we're offering all Indiegogo Launch Backers a 100% no quibble 90 Day Trial on MIX Wireless.

The world is full of unknown. Have you ever been mesmerised by Sci-Fi and curious about what outer space and future might be like? Everytime you watch a movie or read a book on this topic, do you wander off a bit to another dimension, anywhere away from the current place and current time?Gravastar speakers  all have a unique and futuristic design. They were born to infuse creativity and craziness to the speaker market. Gravastar family has two members so far: big brother Mars, and little brother Venus. Put Mars and Venus together, they are the coolest scenery in your room.Mars and Venus serve different purposes. Mars is designed for desks and bookshelves, adding a futuristic touch to your room. Venus is designed to be portable to explore the world with you.Unlike the big brother Mars, Venus is very small. But it inherits the futuristic design and crazy bass.Gravastar Venus Bluetooth Speaker is a warrior from the future. It has traveled through time and space. And its crazy bass can also take you to musical expeditions. Moreover, telepathy in their tribe enables sounds to come out of two speakers at the same time, providing you an immersive theater experience at home. The size of Venus can allow you to hide it at any corner in your bag and is ready to explore the world with you at any time, and party from day to night. Venus is a ballistic soldier from the future who wears a zinc alloy armour, which provides strength and toughness, adding a futuristic touch to your room. The armour provides Venus higher stability when playing crazy bass. Your windows might shake with the sound wave, but the speaker won’t.Venus came from a city where cyberpunk is the mainstream. The never ending dark nights are illuminated by neon lights. Spaceships shuttle among skyscrapers. Venus embodies its home culture by adding 4 different shell colours and 6 RGB lights into its armour.Never underestimate a speaker because of its size. Venus is small but it has dynamite inside. The bass comes from a movable diaphragm at the back of Venus, pumping a large volume of air to boost bass.Turn it on, the dreadful thunderous bass will rock you to death.Therefore, it is essential to equip Venus with a metallic shell and rubber shock absorbers on tripods. With this support, Venus can show you the bass you’ve never experienced before.Having Gravastar Venus in your room is like having an invincible robotic warrior with an AoE attack. It's super loud soundwave will hunt you down to every corner in the room, leaving you nowhere to hide.The 1.75in 10W full-range speaker transfers the powerful sound from the cyber heart to your heart. Venus is adorable yet hardcore: its movable diaphragm produces the sound waves you can see.Gravastar Venus is full of mechanical charm. You can not only enjoy it in your room but carry it to parties. Connect two Venus together, the stereo sound will turn everywhere in the party to the center, and their loud volume will never let you down.Venus has a long Bluetooth connectivity range of 15m. You can lip-sync in the shower room with Venus while leaving your phone in the bedroom.The audio delay is only 60ms, which is so trivial that even skilled gamers wouldn’t notice. Venus helps you avoid the least thing you wanna see when playing games: lose a game because of the sound latency. And the stereo from two speakers can totally immerse you to the game world.Venus can be connected easily with any bluetooth devices. Immerse yourself in the powerful sound in games, music, movies and parties.The stereo experience of Venus is almost invincible. The only thing that can beat Venus is 2 Venus teaming up. The telepathy between two speakers provides you with an even more powerful and immersive stereo experience.Venus is a stamina fighter. With the same amount of charging time, Venus can fight longer in the battlefield, up to 10 hours. You can bring Venus anywhere and party till whenever they want. It is never a party pooper.Venus is tough and low maintenance. It won’t die from a few drops of water. You can be carefree when using it near water. Venus is splashproof and has a waterproof USB-C charging port. You can soak yourself in music when taking showers or going to a pool party without worrying about water leaking damages.Weighing only 410g, the equivalent of two apples, Venus could be easily carried around, in the city, to the seaside, or take an excursion to the desert. Venus is a good companion. Bring it with you on a sunny day to a park or pack Venus in your backpack and go explore the world with music.Mars was launched last year. It brings you the destroyer vibe when you first see it. The illuminating green light in the center looks like a fusion reactor. The solid zinc alloy shell is prepared for risky missions. And the foldable tripods are so neat and forceful that you know they can land on another planet precisely. It has been a great success. It is well received by YouTubers and users.This time when we are launching Venus, we also bring back Space Gray Mars and introduce Sci-Fi Blue Mars for the first time. Tech Blue is a special offer to our backers and has limited numbers.GravaStar Mars is more than just another Bluetooth speaker. We have reinvented how speakers are designed: tight, Zinc Alloy and sleek angles with built-in psychedelic lights, inspired by futuristic science fiction movies and games.  The metal robot appearance doesn't just look cool, but its spherical body allows the sound waves to resonate, which enhances its audio on top of the tripod legs that forms its stable structure.

<h2>Nicholas The Voice</h2>
<p>Are you ready to slow down, listen with an open heart, and find yourself in another form of awareness?</p>
<p>We are pioneering with the creation of “Nicholas The Voice”, a unique collection of deep and meaningful poems, spoken by the author himself while blended with the sacred sounds of Himalayan singing bowls, planetary gong Venus, koshi chimes and the vibrant sounds of nature. The sound is blended in a manner that gives a deeper experience for the listener.</p>
<p>This profound combination has helped us personally to understand more about ourselves, and the nature of life. We are beyond excited to now share it with you!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Poems</strong></h2>
<p>Passion and spirit driven writing and speaking emerges instantly, prolifically, without forethought. It comes directly from the very core of what I am. This is when I enter a zone of awareness where the creative material can then flow into the world, and perhaps change a bit of the world. This kind of inspired writing is what I wish to express from my core as a way of getting clarity out of what was otherwise hidden within.</p>
<p>I wrote most of the material used in the recordings when I lived in the in the wilderness. I lived there for six years. Often I reflect on the ""wilderness"" and what it means, again as a metaphor, for “the dark night of the soul” or, perhaps, the “rising of the sun”, or “transformation of the seasons”. There is a lot revealed in the quiet of the night where much was written. It was part of my communion with the Creator there in the wilderness of my life.</p>
<p>The writing reveals a lot of myself. In is my observation that to find a relationship, transparency reduces entropy. All relationships require transparency, whether friends, family or lovers, transparency is the core of repentance, forgiveness, and unconditional love.</p>
<p>I believe we meet the image and likeness of God in each person as we remember who we are; we remember the divinity of others also. We also rise up into the essence of our created birthright as co-creators.</p>

<p><i>Himalayan singing bowls</i> also known as Tibetan Singing Bowls are sacred instruments crafted from seven different metals.  Singing bowls are vessels that make a musical “singing” sound when struck or played with a mallet. In addition to a primary tone, singing bowls produce a complex series of subtle <i>overtones</i> that create a uniquely soothing sound. They are used for meditation and sound vibrational therapy.</p>

<p>The <i>Gong</i> is one of man’s most powerful tone producers on the planet and the oldest transformational and therapeutic instrument. The Gong sound is organic, deep and nurturing. The “living tones” build upon each other and evolve on their own, producing a sea of sound that is both timeless and alive. The <i>Planetary Gongs</i> are tuned in conformity with the natural harmonic series based in the orbital properties on the Earth, the Moon, the Sun, and the Planets according to calculations of Hans Cousto. Thus, they resonate in harmony with the cycles of the celestial bodies and communicate a distinct aspect of the “music of the spheres”</p>

<h2>Our Story </h2>
<p>We are very excited about each of you joining together with us in this effort. The project grew organically out of the shared enthusiasm of our team, which includes myself, Nicholas Begich (Alaska, USA), Sabrina Miklavcic (Amsterdam, Nederland), Heikki Savolainen (Helsinki, Finland), and now each of you as our underwriters. </p>
<p>The ideas expressed in my words are the focal point of my current, and I believe, my most important writing and recording project ever, a project I was not intending. Yet, here we are.  </p>
<p>I shared my writing with several friends over the years and they all encouraged me to keep writing. Then in early 2017, I sent several poems to Sabrina Miklavcic who I met at a conference in 2012. She immediately was touched by the words and, having also heard my actual voice thought that these verses should be read aloud and recorded. She suggested that the reading, if combined with the sounds of Tibetan singing bowls, gongs, and other unusual sounds, would amplify the depth of the thoughts within the words. </p>
<p>I considered the idea of frequency matching my voice with the sounds Sabrina would generate. The idea that a resonance effect might be created with the combination of the spoken words, emotional texture within them, and the sounds utilized in the compositions was exciting and interesting. The thought was that if they could be composed in such a way as to push the voice modulations into greater power and form. Through the power of resonance, a much greater effect might be realized in the combined word and sound compositions. </p>
<p>The idea of a frequency matched composition and the arrangement of the sounds with the spoken words required a much higher level of technical knowledge in the area of recording engineering. The resourceful Sabrina knew just such a person that could round out the team, Heikki Savolainen, a world recognized expert in sound recording and arrangement with thirty-seven years of experience. </p>
<p>In October 2017 I traveled to Amsterdam to record the first versions utilizing a Dutch recording studio located in the south of Holland. We completed the initial recording and sent them to Helsinki, Finland for Heikki’s. After listening to the recorded words, and being familiar with the sound work of Sabrina he too was hooked and the project team took form in January 2018. </p>
<p>As a collaboration of the three of us in this project our talents and skills are blended into something unique and very different for each of us in the way we approached this project together as a team.  </p>
<p>I believe we are all that esoteric, that hidden thing, we are seeking. It was always there. It is in each of us forming our very essence. It is the created image, created in us and through us, and projected into the world to express something. They say a picture paints a thousand words, which is true indeed. At the same time the words paint a different picture. Those images are projected to the reader, by the composer, as “thought-forms” in words. Those words are tools for transfer with even greater emphasis when combined with sound. There is the art of it. So poetry and verse written can carry deeper information in the pulse of it, and through the flow of it, in the very vibration of it, when it is spoken authentically, from our core. </p>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<p>This crowdfunding effort is intended to help us cover the costs associated with the project. Your funds will help produce, print and ship our CD and Poetry book to you worldwide.</p>
<p>There are over sixty separate selections of original poetry from which ten to twelve are being chosen for the final mastered CD. The remainder of the poems will be used in future work. If we exceed our funding goals in this effort the balance of the funding will be used to produce the additional material into other CDs in the same way as the first one.</p>
<p>With the success of this crowdfunding effort we will produce two initial imprints of the CD one in Europe and one in the USA to facilitate distribution.</p>
<p>We have been busy on this project and have completed the recording of the voice work and the cover are for the CD we are producing. The sounds and pure tones that are used in the compositions have been recorded.</p>
<p>We still need to complete the musical overlays that match the words and vibration carried in them. The first sample recording fully blended has been completed to promote the work and is available here<a href=""https://youtu.be/URpqeNKDbAk"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Nicholas The Voice</a>. CD booklets and inserts need to also be completed.</p>
<p>The Poetry book is in its final stages requiring editing, then must be prepared for printing and the cover design completed.</p>
<p>The initial funding will allow us to take what is in our hearts into the world.</p>

I shared my writing with several friends over the years and they all encouraged me to keep writing. Then in early 2017, I sent several poems to Sabrina Miklavcic who I met at a conference in 2012. She immediately was touched by the words and, having also heard my actual voice thought that these verses should be read aloud and recorded. She suggested that the reading, if combined with the sounds of Tibetan singing bowls, gongs, and other unusual sounds, would amplify the depth of the thoughts within the words. 
I considered the idea of frequency matching my voice with the sounds Sabrina would generate. The idea that a resonance effect might be created with the combination of the spoken words, emotional texture within them, and the sounds utilized in the compositions was exciting and interesting. The thought was that if they could be composed in such a way as to push the voice modulations into greater power and form. Through the power of resonance, a much greater effect might be realized in the combined word and sound compositions. 
The idea of a frequency matched composition and the arrangement of the sounds with the spoken words required a much higher level of technical knowledge in the area of recording engineering. The resourceful Sabrina knew just such a person that could round out the team, Heikki Savolainen, a world recognized expert in sound recording and arrangement with thirty-seven years of experience. 
In October 2017 I traveled to Amsterdam to record the first versions utilizing a Dutch recording studio located in the south of Holland. We completed the initial recording and sent them to Helsinki, Finland for Heikki’s. After listening to the recorded words, and being familiar with the sound work of Sabrina he too was hooked and the project team took form in January 2018. 
As a collaboration of the three of us in this project our talents and skills are blended into something unique and very different for each of us in the way we approached this project together as a team.  
I believe we are all that esoteric, that hidden thing, we are seeking. It was always there. It is in each of us forming our very essence. It is the created image, created in us and through us, and projected into the world to express something. They say a picture paints a thousand words, which is true indeed. At the same time the words paint a different picture. Those images are projected to the reader, by the composer, as “thought-forms” in words. Those words are tools for transfer with even greater emphasis when combined with sound. There is the art of it. So poetry and verse written can carry deeper information in the pulse of it, and through the flow of it, in the very vibration of it, when it is spoken authentically, from our core. 
 
What We Need & What You Get

 
This crowdfunding effort is intended to help us cover the costs associated with the project. Your funds will help produce, print and ship our CD and Poetry book to you worldwide.
There are over sixty separate selections of original poetry from which ten to twelve are being chosen for the final mastered CD. The remainder of the poems will be used in future work. If we exceed our funding goals in this effort the balance of the funding will be used to produce the additional material into other CDs in the same way as the first one.
With the success of this crowdfunding effort we will produce two initial imprints of the CD one in Europe and one in the USA to facilitate distribution.
We have been busy on this project and have completed the recording of the voice work and the cover are for the CD we are producing. The sounds and pure tones that are used in the compositions have been recorded.
We still need to complete the musical overlays that match the words and vibration carried in them. The first sample recording fully blended has been completed to promote the work and is available here Nicholas The Voice. CD booklets and inserts need to also be completed.
The Poetry book is in its final stages requiring editing, then must be prepared for printing and the cover design completed.
The initial funding will allow us to take what is in our hearts into the world.

<p>“The headphones have arrived!</p>
<p>Loving them so far! Paired with my devices immediately, and great sound straight out of the box. I can actually notice the difference from the dual drivers, the clarity is amazing! Solid bass too, which is always important.</p>

<p>“35 years ago I bought a Nakamichi tape deck - it was one of the best available. When I saw the Edge headphones available on crowd-funding I decided to see how good Nakamichi was in this area.</p>
<p>After the initial 4 hour charge I wore them for a solid 3 hours, listening to a random play list on my iPhone via Bluetooth. They were super comfy for the whole period and blocked out much of the external noise.</p>
<p>The sound was clear and sharp and not heavy on the bass - they were a delight to use. I am looking forward to further testing but I am very pleased I made the purchase.</p>
<p>Nakamichi, not just a trusted name, also a great product.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>“When I found out about the Nakamichi EDGE Headphones on IndieGoGo, I grabbed the opportunity and have been using them for many hours now.  No fatigue, no discomfort.  For me, the over-ear comfort and weight of these headphones are ideal.  </p>
<p>My music library ranges from A to Z (**A**madeus to **Z**eppelin).  Each of my several other headphones are favorites depending on the type of music.  These EDGE headphones faithfully reproduce ALL my favorite types of music.  Wow!  They incorporate the best of my other headphones, and more. </p>
<p> From build quality to AI enhancement to Noise canceling to Dual speaker drivers to Wired/wireless; all the advertised specs and features combine perfectly and intelligently.  You know a good thing when you hear it!  The sound stage is smooth and linear.  The musical clarity is crisp and natural; no noticeable coloration as with most headphones.  Using them is like sitting “front row center.” </p>
<p>These are the ones that will be traveling on the road with me, competing sound-wise with my electrostat speakers at home.  I kid you not!”</p>
<p><strong>~ Bruce Smith, California, USA (Order ID#12)</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504864223/s6atvst0xtdajiibbpcp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ever been thrilled with a product because it actually made your life a little better? Well, I'm experiencing that after receiving my EDGE headphones. The agency I work just last week transitioned my team to an ""open office"" environment. For those of you that don't know what that means, you are stacked like cattle with almost ZERO consideration for privacy or noise levels. I was miserable. Now? I can focus. My neighbor can be talking to me and I don't hear a thing. I'm lost in my own world of music and comedy. My headache isn't here and I can focus again. Thank you, EDGE!</p>
<p>For sound quality, these headphones are easily among the best I've used, and I have used quite a few professional/studio level headphones. The dual drivers really do make a difference. The mid doesn't get muddy with even the bassiest music and the highs are nice and clear. And the music AI? I know, it sounds like marketing hype. It actually works. For the first time ever, I have the EQ on my phone turned off. I have no idea how it works, it just does.”</p>

However, do note that after we have sent your headphones to our shipping partner for international fulfillment, there will always be a chance of short delays depending on shipping traffic to your location, storage capacity, etc. This is beyond our control.</p><p data-ce-key=""1847"">A major advantage in creating the EDGE headphones was Nakamichi having a base in Shenzhen, China, labeled by many as the ""manufacturing capital of the world"". This has allowed us to be on the ground, close to the source of production, as well as be highly selective, working with only the best suppliers and manufacturers.</p><p data-ce-key=""1848"">We are working with a top-tier manufacturing partner who owns 27 patents in their noise cancellation technologies. They also manufacture headphones for numerous top brands. Our team in Shenzhen works closely with them, overlooking all factory processes and operations, ensuring both quality and control over the manufacturing process and that every EDGE component is optimized.</p><p data-ce-key=""1849"">Having said that, we cannot completely eliminate any risk of delays. After the campaign ends, we will place a new purchase order of headphones in addition to the 2,700 units with our manufacturing partner. Because factories, in general, are busy producing for the end-of-year shopping seasons (Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas, etc.), and the fact that factories will only begin dedicating resources after receiving a new purchase order, there is a chance that our 2nd order will coincide with orders by other brands, and lead to a delay of 2-4 weeks.</p></div>","“The headphones have arrived!
Loving them so far! Paired with my devices immediately, and great sound straight out of the box. I can actually notice the difference from the dual drivers, the clarity is amazing! Solid bass too, which is always important.
Thanks again for everything!”
~ Si Edwards, Ireland (Order ID #3)

 
“35 years ago I bought a Nakamichi tape deck - it was one of the best available. When I saw the Edge headphones available on crowd-funding I decided to see how good Nakamichi was in this area.
After the initial 4 hour charge I wore them for a solid 3 hours, listening to a random play list on my iPhone via Bluetooth. They were super comfy for the whole period and blocked out much of the external noise.
The sound was clear and sharp and not heavy on the bass - they were a delight to use. I am looking forward to further testing but I am very pleased I made the purchase.
Nakamichi, not just a trusted name, also a great product.”
~ Michael Tyndall, Australia (Order ID #19)

 
“When I found out about the Nakamichi EDGE Headphones on IndieGoGo, I grabbed the opportunity and have been using them for many hours now.  No fatigue, no discomfort.  For me, the over-ear comfort and weight of these headphones are ideal.  
My music library ranges from A to Z (**A**madeus to **Z**eppelin).  Each of my several other headphones are favorites depending on the type of music.  These EDGE headphones faithfully reproduce ALL my favorite types of music.  Wow!  They incorporate the best of my other headphones, and more. 
 From build quality to AI enhancement to Noise canceling to Dual speaker drivers to Wired/wireless; all the advertised specs and features combine perfectly and intelligently.  You know a good thing when you hear it!  The sound stage is smooth and linear.  The musical clarity is crisp and natural; no noticeable coloration as with most headphones.  Using them is like sitting “front row center.” 
These are the ones that will be traveling on the road with me, competing sound-wise with my electrostat speakers at home.  I kid you not!”

The agency I work just last week transitioned my team to an ""open office"" environment. For those of you that don't know what that means, you are stacked like cattle with almost ZERO consideration for privacy or noise levels. I was miserable. Now? I can focus. My neighbor can be talking to me and I don't hear a thing. I'm lost in my own world of music and comedy. My headache isn't here and I can focus again. Thank you, EDGE!
For sound quality, these headphones are easily among the best I've used, and I have used quite a few professional/studio level headphones. The dual drivers really do make a difference. The mid doesn't get muddy with even the bassiest music and the highs are nice and clear. And the music AI? I know, it sounds like marketing hype. It actually works. For the first time ever, I have the EQ on my phone turned off. I have no idea how it works, it just does.”

The Proof is in the Sound

 

For 70 years, Nakamichi has been delivering top-quality audio products to consumers around the world. A passion for music combined with an unwavering commitment to quality and performance are the principles that have preserved Nakamichi's place as one of the most innovative electronic brands to date.   


Combining Nakamichi's AI logic, dual speaker driver configuration, and new generation speaker drivers, the sound quality is clean, clear and dynamic. With the Nakamichi EDGE, we created a custom logic board with built-in intelligence that responds to both the environment and music to elevate your listening enjoyment. Experience sound enhancement tailored to each song in your playlist for more clarity, depth, and spaciousness.
 


 



The first of its kind, Nakamichi has incorporated new, patented distortion-free speakers into a dual driver configuration. The magnetic field confinement of the internal voice coil has been upgraded for more accurate audio reproduction, resulting in the clearest sound and cleanest bass.

Research-Backed Results
Nakamichi speaker drivers have shown up to 3x less total harmonic distortion (THD) when compared to market-leading high-performance speaker drivers.
Speaker Driver Comparison*

*Near-perfect conversion of electrical signal into sound results in greater accuracy.
 
Total Harmonic Distortion Comparison*

*Delivers up to 3x less Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) when compared to similar, high-performance speaker drivers
 


Technology has changed the way we listen to music. Today, we listen to music longer, louder and from an earlier age than ever before. The AI logic not only enhances audio quality to new levels, it also intelligently monitors your audio exposure to protect your hearing without sacrificing enjoyment or quality.AI gives you complete listening freedom and a lifetime of healthy hearing! Up until now, headphones that help protect against noise-induced hearing loss host non-intelligent software that regulates and limits volume without user input. A simple analogy: How many people want to own a car that can only go up to 65mph? Answer: Not many.  The most recent US data shows: 



 

 


 

Tune Out, So You Can Tune In
 

Using 4 synchronized noise-sensitive microphones, the EDGE's advanced noise cancellation actively harmonizes your surroundings by blocking out unwanted noise, setting you up with pure music enjoyment. We have chosen to combine both ""Feed Forward"" and ""Feedback"" methods for superior ANC performance. Each earcup has TWO noise-sensing microphones—one on the exterior and one inside.  We have chosen to utilize a ""Hybrid"" approach to noise cancellation, combining both ""Feed Forward"" and ""Feedback"" methods for superior ANC performance. Each earcup has TWO noise-sensing microphones, one on the exterior and one inside.Benefits of our Advanced Noise Cancellation technology:
Cancels noise at a broader range of frequencies
Cancels even more noise (up to 30dB reduction)
The Feedback microphone inside earcup provides an additional step of improving noise cancellation accuracy
Not sensitive to how the listener wears the headphones
Clearer phone calls

In a partnership with Nakamichi, an audio company with almost 70 years of acoustic and engineering experience, the EDGE was able to evolve from a concept to reality. Through this crowdfunding campaign, the EDGE team hopes to combat the ever growing threat of noise induced hearing loss by introducing technology that will result in a lifetime of healthy hearing. Production Has Already Begun!

 
A month ago, we started producing our first batch of EDGE Headphones. Being the 5th production run since the project's inception, we have already optimized many procedures that occur during production and assembly, ensuring top-quality construction and efficiency. With a 70-year legacy of innovation and audio excellence, we at Nakamichi have successfully integrated Artificial Intelligence with cutting-edge, exclusive hardware technology. We have created a pair of smart headphones that elevate your listening experience and guards your ears from noise-induced hearing loss simultaneously, in real-time. Our many decades of experience in design, product development, engineering, manufacturing and international fulfillment makes us the best candidate to taking this new breed of headphones to your doorstep, in pristine quality and by the most efficient way possible.Partners:Marketing partner: Joe Johnston (Crowdlift), PR partner: PRserve, Videographer: Rumpus Creative, Photographer: Anthony Pontillas What is the sound quality like?Combining our proprietary AI logic, dual speaker driver configuration, and new generation speaker drivers, the sound quality is clean, clear and dynamic. However, we all know that sound quality is subjective. This is why we organized a Nakamichi demo event for blind-testers to try the headphones, as well as produced sample units for reviewers and journalists to test out. Please see our Nakamichi demo event and expert testimonial videos on the campaign page.How are your dual speaker drivers superior to having only one?Our dual speaker driver configuration has a 40mm driver and a 23mm driver. Their different sizes mean that each of them are better suited to reproduce audio from different spectrums of the entire frequency range. The larger (40mm) driver reproduces low-mid frequencies more accurately, while the smaller (23mm) driver excels at the high frequencies. After our AI logic aggregates the audio elements of your music, it channels each and every bit of output audio to the most suitable driver. This unlocks new and unheard-of details in your music.What is the battery life?14 hours (when LED lights are off).Are these headphones comfortable?The EDGE was designed and built with long term comfort in mind. The ear cushions and headband feature extra-soft durable protein leather, allowing you to wear it for extended listening sessions. The headband is adjustable, allowing the headphones to conform easily to your head.What is the Bluetooth version?4.0.How many Bluetooth devices can be simultaneously connected to the headphones?Two Bluetooth devices can be simultaneously connected to the headphones, but of these only one device can be used to listen to music or make phone calls at any time.How many devices can the headphones remember?The headphones' Bluetooth functionality will remember up to 8 devices. It will automatically connect to the last device it was paired to when it is powered on, provided that device's Bluetooth is switched on.How long is the warranty?Parts = 1 year. Labor = 90 days.Do you accept returns? What is your return policy?Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns here on IndieGoGo. We will, however, repair or replace a defective unit at no cost. Thanks for your understanding.What does the cost of shipping cover?Overseas shipping from China, thus the shipping cost was calculated based on the origin of manufacturing. For 90% of locations (USA, Europe, Canada, Australia, etc.), we have chosen to ship using DHL. Otherwise, we will use a shipper of similar standards to DHL.Are the headphones firmware upgradeable?No. Risks & ChallengesWith 2,700 units already produced, there is no other way to prove that this product will be a success. Furthermore, we have already gone through 5 production runs and optimized many procedures along the way prior to this. Assuming that all backers provide timely shipping info, we will be able to provide immediate fulfillment once the campaign ends. However, do note that after we have sent your headphones to our shipping partner for international fulfillment, there will always be a chance of short delays depending on shipping traffic to your location, storage capacity, etc. This is beyond our control.A major advantage in creating the EDGE headphones was Nakamichi having a base in Shenzhen, China, labeled by many as the ""manufacturing capital of the world"". This has allowed us to be on the ground, close to the source of production, as well as be highly selective, working with only the best suppliers and manufacturers.We are working with a top-tier manufacturing partner who owns 27 patents in their noise cancellation technologies. They also manufacture headphones for numerous top brands. Our team in Shenzhen works closely with them, overlooking all factory processes and operations, ensuring both quality and control over the manufacturing process and that every EDGE component is optimized.Having said that, we cannot completely eliminate any risk of delays. After the campaign ends, we will place a new purchase order of headphones in addition to the 2,700 units with our manufacturing partner. Because factories, in general, are busy producing for the end-of-year shopping seasons (Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas, etc.), and the fact that factories will only begin dedicating resources after receiving a new purchase order, there is a chance that our 2nd order will coincide with orders by other brands, and lead to a delay of 2-4 weeks.",49.0,6,"1 Campaign

No hay un límite por persona. Toda donación es importante y toda donación es bienvenida. Una donación de $5.00 podría ser un Uber para llegar a un show, un almuerzo, o una porción de un pasaje. 
¿Qué recibiras a cambio del donativo?
Hemos diseñado cierto premios como incentivos a esta causa. 
Donaciones de $20.00 recibirán el SXSW 2017 ""playlist"", un grupo de canciones brutales, excesivamente sabrosas y jugosas que durará 2 horas. 
Donaciones de $60.00 podrán obtener una clase de guitarra de una hora.
Donaciones de $100.00 tendrán la opción de usar el estudio de grabación por 5 horas, o tomar 2 clases de guitarra de una hora cada una.
Al donar $400.00 el donante podrá organizar un show, o evento en donde la banda participaría y tocaría en vivo para sus invitados. El donante proveerá el local y se coordinará la fecha. También existe la opción de tener un paquete de 10 clases de guitarra, cada clase de una hora. Si no deseas nada a cambio de tu donación, no hay problema ;P.

<h3><strong>Mystery in small sound chamber</strong></h3>
<p>There is a great mystery in Mugo’s small sound chamber. By introducing professional paper tuning to control the airflow of the sound chamber, the bass performance of Mugo achieves deeper dove, making each drumbeat in music seem like a resonance within your chest.</p>

<h3>Fits perfectly and comfortably, just like “growing” in ears</h3>
<p>Based on human engineering analysis, the in-ear design makes the end of Mugo fit the outline of ears tightly; while the diagonal design of the front cavity sound mouth matches the structure of human’s acoustic meatus better. Through the double-fitting design, Mugo fits as comfortably as “growing” in ears. It will not fall when in movement and brings no wearer discomfort even after long use.</p>

<p style=""font-style: italic;"">So.... and I'm sure you know where we are headed with this, if you send us 5 people who back Piggyback by Cimorelli, we'll give you your SINGLE set for free.

The same cannot be said from a cheap dollar store Y splitter. Also they do not allow you to share a conversation. You could hear one, but if you spoke, no one would hear you. Also, with Piggyback by Cimorelli, everyone connected can operate the controls. Anyone can answer a call, play or pause the music or even skip a song. Everybody’s controls work. Basic splitters don't have that level of control. </p>

<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">We have already secured the financing for tooling and have established a supply chain that can handle a production volume of 1,000,000 units a year. We have started our plastic injection tooling and are currently gearing up for a trial run of 500 units that will happen during January. The trial run will be held in strategic locations in Africa and Asia. <br/><br/>We now need about $80,000 to jump start our mass manufacturing that is scheduled for March next year. This amount needed is equivalent to about 3,000 units which is a decent batch size to get KULUMI mobilized for the Developing World. Our mass manufacturing will start at a slower rate if we fall short on reaching our fund raising target.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #008000;""><strong>Your support to our project will make KULUMI a reality for people living in the Developing World, and you will be one of the first to enjoy the benefits that KULUMI offers!</strong></span><br/><br/></p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<h3><strong><img alt=""HTG logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.hopetechglobal.com/CFpics/HTG-logo-final-01.png"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;""/></strong></h3>
<p>Hope Tech Global has been in business for 4 years and we have a vast network of suppliers. We have developed products for many customers over the years, however, we came to the point where we realized that we can make better use of our resources and time. Thus we decided to focus our efforts on creating products that can make a difference for people living in the Developing World.</p>
<p>KULUMI is the result of our passion. The combination of a battery powered powerful LED Light and a high quality Audio Player provides several benefits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Use Case 1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.hopetechglobal.com/CFpics/UseCase1.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p>The LED Light enables children to study at night, prevents accidents in home and helps one get around in the dark.<br/><br/>The Audio Player provides a platform for Audio Education and Entertainment. Many people in the Developing World are still illiterate and this capability enables them to study.  Content can be downloaded via a USB interface and you can quickly access different kinds of contents via 5 customizable segments of content.</p>
<p><img alt=""Use Case 2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.hopetechglobal.com/CFpics/UseCase2.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">KULUMI includes a Li-Ion battery which means you can use it anywhere. It has a flexible recharge setup which allows you to either charge it via a solar panel or 9V - 20V DC input. So whether you are in the outdoors or connected to a stable or unstable grid you can always be sure that you can use KULUMI.<br/><br/>KULUMI also comes with a convenient feature that can allow you to recharge your phone via a 5V USB output. Most people in Developing World went from no access to a land-line to a mobile phone. There are many places where the mobile network is up but no grid is available to recharge their phone. KULUMI caters for this need.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #008000;""><strong>KULUMI is ready, and with your help we are going to make a dent in their universe. Pick a perk located on the right hand side and lets make it happen!</strong></span></p>

<h3><strong>The Last Mile</strong></h3>
<p><img alt=""Last Mile"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.hopetechglobal.com/sites/default/files/H_hope.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: right;""/>We realize that one of the most significant challenges of helping people in the Developing World is to cover the last mile and get the help to them. HTG is answering this challenge by working with organizations based in the Developing World. We are also in the process of creating a distribution system. This distribution system is built around empowering a like-minded individual who will be able to distribute products that bring Hope in their community. With this model HTG can control costs and ensure that the people who most need the product can actually get it at the best price.</p>
<p align=""LEFT"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The first wave of KULUMIs distributed in the Developing World will be targeted at urban centres. These areas typically have access to some power. It is also likely that rural families here have a member or a relative living in an urban center. Thus KULUMI has a chance to reach rural areas via these relationships.

<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can you tell me more about Kulumi's battery life? </strong><br/><br/>Kulumi has a rechargable 10Wh Li-Ion battery. It is possible to CHOOSE the degrees of illuminations depending on your circumastances. Being tri directional, you can illuminate one, two or all 3 sides, and then have the option to have them at 10% , 25% , 50% and 100% fullly illuminated. For each one of these the battery life will differ.<br/><br/>Below is a breakdown of the battery life using lamp at various brightness settings:</p>
<p><img alt=""Battery Life"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.hopetechglobal.com/CFpics/BatteryLife.JPG"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 120px; margin-right: 120px;""/><br/><br/>The Audio Player can be used for 14h at 100% volume if the light is not used.<br/><br/>Kulumi should charge two phones to 100% capacity (phone dependent).<br/><br/><strong>What is the bulb life like?</strong><br/>Kulumi consists of high power LEDs that have a long life. The minimum life of the LEDs at 100% brightness is 5 years. At lower brightness settings you can easily stretch the life of the lamp to more than 10 years. The above estimates is based on using the lamp for 4h everyday.</p>
<p>Kulumi has 3 sides that produce light output which adds to its robustness. Should one side fail after 5 years then the other sides will continue to work.<br/><br/><strong>Why is the solar panel not integrated into the Kulumi enclosure?</strong><br/>Kulumi has a large Li-Ion battery (10Wh) and a small built-in solar panel can not sufficiently charge it. Thus an external solar panel allows you to fully charge the battery. You can locate the solar panel in a convenient place and you do not have to leave your Kulumi in the sun. This allows you to continue using it indoors while it is charging.<br/><br/><strong>Does Kulumi have a strap or handle?</strong><br/>The 3 metal rods actually forms a very good handle. You can also use the metal rods to hang it on from a hook, nail or branch.<br/><br/><strong>What is the weight and size of Kulumi?</strong><br/>Weight: 400g (0.9 pounds)<br/>Size: 115mm x 105mm x 155mm (4.5"" x 4.1"" x 6.1"")</p>

Hope Tech Global is staffed by a multinational team from 6 countries. This provides us with a strong global network. Our team is committed to deliver services and products with excellence through continued innovation and persistence. Our mandate is clear: to continuously strive to provide Hope through Technology on a Global scale.
Our goal for 2013 is that KULUMI will impact 100,000 families in the Developing World by providing them adequate lighting, audio education and training in their own language.
You can help us achieve this goal by picking a perk located on the right hand side. Every contribution counts, no matter how small it is!

 
What We Need & What You Get
We have already secured the financing for tooling and have established a supply chain that can handle a production volume of 1,000,000 units a year. We have started our plastic injection tooling and are currently gearing up for a trial run of 500 units that will happen during January. The trial run will be held in strategic locations in Africa and Asia. We now need about $80,000 to jump start our mass manufacturing that is scheduled for March next year. This amount needed is equivalent to about 3,000 units which is a decent batch size to get KULUMI mobilized for the Developing World. Our mass manufacturing will start at a slower rate if we fall short on reaching our fund raising target.
Your support to our project will make KULUMI a reality for people living in the Developing World, and you will be one of the first to enjoy the benefits that KULUMI offers!

 
The Impact

Hope Tech Global has been in business for 4 years and we have a vast network of suppliers. We have developed products for many customers over the years, however, we came to the point where we realized that we can make better use of our resources and time. Thus we decided to focus our efforts on creating products that can make a difference for people living in the Developing World.
KULUMI is the result of our passion. The combination of a battery powered powerful LED Light and a high quality Audio Player provides several benefits.
 

The LED Light enables children to study at night, prevents accidents in home and helps one get around in the dark.The Audio Player provides a platform for Audio Education and Entertainment. Many people in the Developing World are still illiterate and this capability enables them to study.  Content can be downloaded via a USB interface and you can quickly access different kinds of contents via 5 customizable segments of content.

 
KULUMI includes a Li-Ion battery which means you can use it anywhere. It has a flexible recharge setup which allows you to either charge it via a solar panel or 9V - 20V DC input. So whether you are in the outdoors or connected to a stable or unstable grid you can always be sure that you can use KULUMI.KULUMI also comes with a convenient feature that can allow you to recharge your phone via a 5V USB output. Most people in Developing World went from no access to a land-line to a mobile phone. There are many places where the mobile network is up but no grid is available to recharge their phone. KULUMI caters for this need.
KULUMI is ready, and with your help we are going to make a dent in their universe. Pick a perk located on the right hand side and lets make it happen!
 
The Last Mile
We realize that one of the most significant challenges of helping people in the Developing World is to cover the last mile and get the help to them. HTG is answering this challenge by working with organizations based in the Developing World. We are also in the process of creating a distribution system. This distribution system is built around empowering a like-minded individual who will be able to distribute products that bring Hope in their community. With this model HTG can control costs and ensure that the people who most need the product can actually get it at the best price.
The first wave of KULUMIs distributed in the Developing World will be targeted at urban centres. These areas typically have access to some power. It is also likely that rural families here have a member or a relative living in an urban center. Thus KULUMI has a chance to reach rural areas via these relationships. This will be one of the many distribution strategies we will be implementing.  The goal is to first establish a beach head in area where there is some resources before moving deeper into the rural areas.Your support towards KULUMI is very important. By picking a perk you are helping us launch KULUMI, scale mass manufacturing and gain the needed momentum to go deep into the Developing World!

My goal is for Plasmonic to approach the depth and detail of an acoustic instrument, while making it easy to shape the sound into anything you want. Its deep modulation capability and MPE support make it very playable and expressive. </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578914843/jkso5prziu6n3kejhjrm.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><h3> </h3><h3>Filters</h3><p>The heart of Plasmonic is a self-oscillating waveguide/multimode ladder filter pair, which can be configured in parallel or in series. Each filter can take any combination of the audio sources as input. This creates some very interesting sonic interactions between the audio source and the feedback loop of the waveguide.</p><h3>Sources</h3><p>Audio sources include two wavetable oscillators, a sample-based impulse generator (built-in samples only), and a filtered noise generator. Both oscillators have waveform transformations which nicely complement the waveguide. The impulse generator is especially suited for making the waveguide ring. </p><h3>Master Channel</h3><p>The master section contains a 3-band EQ, a saturator which can be polyphonic or monophonic, modulated delay effects and a final resonator effect. Like the waveguide, the delay effects are capable of self-oscillation, which can lead to all kinds of sonic mayhem.</p><h3>Modulation</h3><p>Modulation is deep and makes it easy to add detail and life to the sound. Each parameter has a popup panel displaying the depth, polarity and inversion of each modulation source, allowing unprecedented control. Currently there are 5 ADSR envelopes, 3 LFOs, a triggered random source, as well as midi control inputs. Development of the modulation section is evolving rapidly, and I intend to make it as fun and flexible as possible.</p><h3>Interface</h3><p>A resizable, single-panel user interface makes it easy to see where the dynamics of the patch are happening. </p><h3>Sounds</h3><p>I have already been contacted by many top-level sound designers who want to create sounds for Plasmonic. Plasmonic always surprises me when creating my own patches, and I can’t wait to hear what others will come up with! </p><h3>Specs</h3><p>* 4 audio sources:</p><p>    * 2 wavetable oscillators with dynamic wave transformations</p><p>    * A special impulse generator for making the waveguide ring</p><p>    * A noise generator with its own resonant lowpass filter</p><p>    </p><p>* 2 interacting filters:</p><p>    * A self-oscillating waveguide provides organic resonance</p><p>    * A multimode self-oscillating ladder filter: LP, HP, BP, 1, 2 and 4 pole </p><p>    * Each filter can take any combination of audio sources</p><p>    * Can be configured in series or parallel</p><p> </p><p>* Polyphonic saturation</p><p>* Self-oscillating delay effects</p><p>* Deep, precise modulation system</p><p>* Multiple ADSR and LFOs with unique features</p><p>* 6 configurable control macros</p><p>* MPE support</p><p>* NKS compatible</p><p>* Resizable single-panel graphic interface</p><p>* macOS: AU, VST 2 and 3, standalone, 64 bit</p><p>* Windows: VST 2 and 3, standalone, 64 bit</p><p> </p><h3>About Rhizomatic and Brian Clevinger</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578922752/hzsdwyeunal1huuxzqv0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>I’m the creator and primary developer of Native Instruments Absynth 1-5.

Its deep modulation capability and MPE support make it very playable and expressive.  FiltersThe heart of Plasmonic is a self-oscillating waveguide/multimode ladder filter pair, which can be configured in parallel or in series. Each filter can take any combination of the audio sources as input. This creates some very interesting sonic interactions between the audio source and the feedback loop of the waveguide.SourcesAudio sources include two wavetable oscillators, a sample-based impulse generator (built-in samples only), and a filtered noise generator. Both oscillators have waveform transformations which nicely complement the waveguide. The impulse generator is especially suited for making the waveguide ring. Master ChannelThe master section contains a 3-band EQ, a saturator which can be polyphonic or monophonic, modulated delay effects and a final resonator effect. Like the waveguide, the delay effects are capable of self-oscillation, which can lead to all kinds of sonic mayhem.ModulationModulation is deep and makes it easy to add detail and life to the sound. Each parameter has a popup panel displaying the depth, polarity and inversion of each modulation source, allowing unprecedented control. Currently there are 5 ADSR envelopes, 3 LFOs, a triggered random source, as well as midi control inputs. Development of the modulation section is evolving rapidly, and I intend to make it as fun and flexible as possible.InterfaceA resizable, single-panel user interface makes it easy to see where the dynamics of the patch are happening. SoundsI have already been contacted by many top-level sound designers who want to create sounds for Plasmonic. Plasmonic always surprises me when creating my own patches, and I can’t wait to hear what others will come up with! Specs* 4 audio sources:    * 2 wavetable oscillators with dynamic wave transformations    * A special impulse generator for making the waveguide ring    * A noise generator with its own resonant lowpass filter    * 2 interacting filters:    * A self-oscillating waveguide provides organic resonance    * A multimode self-oscillating ladder filter: LP, HP, BP, 1, 2 and 4 pole     * Each filter can take any combination of audio sources    * Can be configured in series or parallel * Polyphonic saturation* Self-oscillating delay effects* Deep, precise modulation system* Multiple ADSR and LFOs with unique features* 6 configurable control macros* MPE support* NKS compatible* Resizable single-panel graphic interface* macOS: AU, VST 2 and 3, standalone, 64 bit* Windows: VST 2 and 3, standalone, 64 bit About Rhizomatic and Brian ClevingerI’m the creator and primary developer of Native Instruments Absynth 1-5. I have 20 years experience developing synthesis software which is used by thousands of musicians in countless major music productions and films. I am always thinking about how to maximize the sonic and creative potential of my instrument designs. I know what it takes to develop reliable, cpu efficient software of the highest audio quality.Risks and challengesI’m very aware of what it takes to produce a professional software instrument, as well as what can go wrong! There are still many details to complete, but Plasmonic is at an advanced stage now and the most challenging work is done. There is always a chance release could be delayed a couple of months, I do not wish to release an unfinished product. I will keep backers informed of the progress and let them know of any delays. Release TargetSummer 2020.  Videos:Plucked/hammered sounds with polyphonic pitch bend

<h2><span style=""color: #222222;"">Not your typical crowdfunding campaign</span></h2>
<p>We are a successful but small company that has developed high-end digital music servers since 2005. So why are we asking for your help? The answer is simple: We believe the idea behind Olive ONE is big--too big for our existing audiophile channel. Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We want to build ONE to YOUR specification:</strong> Not only should you be able to get ONE in your favorite color and pattern, but also with the features you want. The hard- and software platform of ONE is very powerful. So powerful that we cannot envision all its possibilities. We want you to be part of our development team, and help us realize its potential.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Help speed up go-to-market:</strong> Your feedback is crucial to guide our development team, and help us to get it to market quickly. Your input will make the ONE instantaneously successful, because you'll be the driving force behind it!<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Audiophile quality at an affordable price:</strong> We have only used best-in-class audio components and finest aluminum and glass materials for ONE. If we sell it through our regular distribution channel, the price will more than triple.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt=""Build it like YOU want it, get it faster, save $800!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://downloads.olive.us/indiegogo/3Points.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;"" title=""Three key points!""/></p>
<hr size=""3""/>
<h3><span style=""color: #222222;"">ONE is different</span></h3>
<p>There are hundreds of networked music players, docking stations and other digital music players out there. But none of the other combine all these incredible features:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""#allmusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Access to all your music through one simple touchscreen interface</a></li>

<h3><span style=""color: #222222;"">A true Wireless HD docking station. No docking required.</span></h3>
<p>When designing ONE we thought it would be nice to connect all your portable gadgets and music libraries, and never ever have to deal with connectors and adapters again. So we simply packed it with the latest-and-greatest wireless technologies: </p>
<p><img alt=""Packed with the best in wireless technologies"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://downloads.olive.us/indiegogo/wireless_indiegogo.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;"" title=""Packed with the best in wireless technologies""/></p>

<p><em>Never worry about connectors again. ONE connects wirelessly to all your favorite gadgets and your network!</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<hr size=""3""/>
<h3><span>Got a stereo? No problem.</span></h3>
<p>The Olive ONE has a digital out (RCA, coax) and analog out connector (3.5mm) so you can connect ONE to your amplifier, receiver, or external DAC. Gigabit Ethernet connectivity is now also built-in!</p>

<h3><span style=""color: #222222;""><a name=""allmusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Plays all the music in the world.</span></h3>
<p>If you are like us, you love music. So we made sure ONE plays all of it:</p>
<ul>
<li>We plan to support all major music services like e.g. Pandora or Spotify. ONE is easily upgradeable through the internet, so you can tell us which services we should add next.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Play music from cloud services like Amazon Locker, iTunes Match and Google Play. Or use ONE as your own — subscription free — home music cloud (see built-in HDD below).<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Streaming is great, if your network is stable. Music stored on ONE’s internal HDD (optional) plays instantly, and can be mixed any way you like. No buffering, no advertising breaks. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Services"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://downloads.olive.us/indiegogo/Services.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Services""/></p>
<p><em>Plays all your music. Even the bad one.</em></p>
<hr size=""3""/>
<h3><span style=""color: #222222;"">ONE + ONE + ONE...</span></h3>
<p>If you have more than one room — and we hope you do — you can simply add ONE to each room and play the same or different songs. It takes one simple button-click to connect ONE to your network (via WPS).</p>
<p><img alt=""Multiroom view"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://downloads.olive.us/indiegogo/Multiroom.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;"" title=""Multiroom view""/></p>

<h3><span style=""color: #222222;""><a name=""control"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Control from anywhere.</span></h3>
<p>Like most other music players (yawn!) we will offer iPhone, iPad or Android Apps to control ONE (<strong>Update:</strong> Due to the many requests we have received from our backers we have added Windows Phone 8 to our app development roadmap). We also plan to offer a web interface, so you can display the user interface on your TV.</p>

<h3><span style=""color: #222222;""><a name=""musicos"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Smart. Social. Open. The ONE Music OS.</span></h3>
<p>We believe the Music Operating System is one of the key benefits of ONE, and where you will have the biggest impact in its development. It is revolutionary in three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Smart:</strong> ONE learns from your listening habits. So the more you play, the smarter it gets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Social:</strong> Connect ONE to your social networks, and post or tweet your favorite music discoveries.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Open:</strong> As a true crowd-powered device, ONE is built on open architecture and engages everyone that cares about music. </li>

<p><em>Working together to build the best music experience for your home.</em></p>
<p><strong>Music lovers:</strong> As a backer of the project you are an active member of our development team. We'll ask you for feedback frequently and let the community vote on key features, design issues and other exciting stuff. Your involvement doesn't stop once the product is shipped to you. We have put a ""Hotline"" function directly into the user interface, allowing you to submit feedback right from your Olive ONE touchscreen and directly to our engineers in San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>Artists:</strong> Our vision is that Olive ONE will become the platform of choice for you — beloved jazz ensembles, garage bands, and rock stars — to deliver Studio Master Quality recordings directly to their fans. The Open Music Platform serves as the backbone. We even plan to integrate crowdfunding functionality so you can fund your projects directly through ONE. A crowdfunded music player doing crowdfunding. How cool is that?</p>
<p><strong>App Developers:</strong> Geeks unite! We will be providing a Software Development Kit that will allow you to take advantage of the powerful hard- and software platform and build the coolest music apps.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Designers and Creative artist:</strong> Our goal is to make ONE completely customizable (we need special machinery for this). So you can design your ONE in the most amazing colors and designs you can imagine. We are already in talks with some famous designers that would love to wrap ONE in their distinctive design patterns, but more about this later ...</p>
<p><strong>Industrial Designers:</strong> Don't like our design? Tough luck (just kidding). While the first ONE is already designed, we are open to feedback from industrial designers on how to design our roadmap of great new products. So if you are one of the many talented designers out there. We love to hear from you, and will put your proposal up for vote! </p>

<h2><span style=""color: #222222;"">The People Behind Olive ONE</span></h2>
<p>We are a team of music lovers, engineers and scientists that have built audiophile-grade HD Music Servers since 2005. Today Olive products are sold in more than 50 countries around the world, and we have developed a small but loyal fan base. Our company is based in the heart of San Francisco, at the intersection of technology, design, and music. And as crazy as it sounds, we also hand-built all our products here. With the introduction of Olive ONE we plan to bring our award-winning audiophile sound quality to everyone, and evolve into a truly customer-driven development and design center.</p>
<hr size=""3""/>
<h2><span style=""color: #222222;"">FAQ</span></h2>
<p><strong><em>Which countries do we ship to?</em></strong></p>
<p>Olive ships to more than 220 countries worldwide.  If you are unsure that we ship to your country please contact us at info [at] olivehd.com and we will confirm. Please always add international freight costs to your perk (specified at each perk level).</p>
<p><strong><em>Why does the Olive ONE sound better than any other digital music player out there?</em></strong></p>
<p>If you’re an audiophile, you’ll be impressed by our 32-bit/384kHz Burr-Brown DAC and its dual HD amplifiers. If you’re not an audiophile, here’s all you need to know: Wow.</p>
<p><em> Home Entertainment (USA)<strong><br/></strong></em>""The Olive sounded absolutely superb!""</p>
<p><em>WhatHi-Fi?, Editors' Choice (UK)<strong><br/></strong></em>""This is 21st century hi-fi: Superb to live with and listen to.""</p>
<p><em>Financial Times (UK)<strong><br/></strong></em>""A whole-house audio system capable of delivering top-quality sound.""</p>
<p><em>AudioVideo revolution (USA)<strong><br/></strong></em>""Excellent, punchy bass, plenty of soundstage depth, and great musical flow!""</p>
<p><em>STEREO, Reference Class (Germany)<strong><br/></strong></em>""Sound quality and design are top notch!""</p>
<p><em>The Sunday Morning Herald (Australia)<strong><br/></strong></em>""iPod-style convenience and optimum quality!""</p>
<p><strong><em>How far are you in the development of Olive ONE and when will it be ready?</em></strong></p>
<p>Pretty far. The hard- and software platform and the industrial design are basically done, and we have the first production samples already at our SF office (come by and see us!). Now we need your help to finish the software, buy tooling and expand our manufacturing capabilities. If all goes well we plan to ship the first ONE in July 2013.</p>
<p><strong><em>How can I control the Olive ONE?</em></strong></p>
<p>The Olive ONE can be controlled via the built-in touchscreen or our free iPhone, iPad and Android apps. Additionally you can view the user interface on the big screen, if your TV supports a standard web browser interface.</p>
<p><strong><em>How do I know if I need a hard drive? </em></strong></p>
<p>If you have an existing digital music library (e.g. on your Mac or PC) and you don’t want to stream it, then get the version with the hard drive. If you have lots of CDs we recommend to take advantage of our pre-load service (we use a bunch of robots to load all your CDs onto your ONE.). At the end of the day, the hard drive makes you independent from the network. We are also working on a subscription-free Home Cloud Service that will let you access the music on your ONE, anywhere in the world. </p>
<p><strong><em>How can I customize my Olive ONE?</em></strong></p>
<p>If we reach the $1M benchmark we will buy special machinery that allows you to define the color and pattern of the enclosure, glass surface and digital wallpaper. We have developed a cool customization tool that allows you to preview how your customized design will look like. You can even save those designs and share them with other backers (and enter a contest to win a prize).</p>

Designed by you.
We love music, and it's everywhere. On our smartphone, our Mac/PC, or in the cloud. Olive ONE gives you convenient access to all your music, through one simple touchscreen interface. And it features our award-winning audiophile sound technology so you can enjoy your music in amazing quality.

No need to fumble for your smartphone. ONE comes with a gorgeous touchscreen!


Not your typical crowdfunding campaign
We are a successful but small company that has developed high-end digital music servers since 2005. So why are we asking for your help? The answer is simple: We believe the idea behind Olive ONE is big--too big for our existing audiophile channel. Here’s why:


We want to build ONE to YOUR specification: Not only should you be able to get ONE in your favorite color and pattern, but also with the features you want. The hard- and software platform of ONE is very powerful. So powerful that we cannot envision all its possibilities. We want you to be part of our development team, and help us realize its potential.


Help speed up go-to-market: Your feedback is crucial to guide our development team, and help us to get it to market quickly. Your input will make the ONE instantaneously successful, because you'll be the driving force behind it!


Audiophile quality at an affordable price: We have only used best-in-class audio components and finest aluminum and glass materials for ONE. If we sell it through our regular distribution channel, the price will more than triple.



ONE is different
There are hundreds of networked music players, docking stations and other digital music players out there. But none of the other combine all these incredible features:

Access to all your music through one simple touchscreen interface
Navigate & play music on your TV
Audiophile sound quality
Open architecture for app developers and artist
Customizable design with fine aluminum and glass materials

The Olive ONE does. And with your help it can become even better.
 
It smiles with every track you play!


A true Wireless HD docking station. No docking required.
When designing ONE we thought it would be nice to connect all your portable gadgets and music libraries, and never ever have to deal with connectors and adapters again. So we simply packed it with the latest-and-greatest wireless technologies: 

 
Never worry about connectors again. ONE connects wirelessly to all your favorite gadgets and your network!
 

Got a stereo? No problem.
The Olive ONE has a digital out (RCA, coax) and analog out connector (3.5mm) so you can connect ONE to your amplifier, receiver, or external DAC. Gigabit Ethernet connectivity is now also built-in!


Plays all the music in the world.
If you are like us, you love music. So we made sure ONE plays all of it:

We plan to support all major music services like e.g. Pandora or Spotify. ONE is easily upgradeable through the internet, so you can tell us which services we should add next.

Play music from cloud services like Amazon Locker, iTunes Match and Google Play. Or use ONE as your own — subscription free — home music cloud (see built-in HDD below).

Streaming is great, if your network is stable. Music stored on ONE’s internal HDD (optional) plays instantly, and can be mixed any way you like. No buffering, no advertising breaks. 

 

Plays all your music. Even the bad one.

ONE + ONE + ONE...
If you have more than one room — and we hope you do — you can simply add ONE to each room and play the same or different songs. It takes one simple button-click to connect ONE to your network (via WPS).

Fill your home with music. Wirelessly!

Control from anywhere.
Like most other music players (yawn!) we will offer iPhone, iPad or Android Apps to control ONE (Update: Due to the many requests we have received from our backers we have added Windows Phone 8 to our app development roadmap). We also plan to offer a web interface, so you can display the user interface on your TV.

Cool apps, even cooler TV interface. Let us know what you want to see on your big screen!

Smart. Social. Open. The ONE Music OS.
We believe the Music Operating System is one of the key benefits of ONE, and where you will have the biggest impact in its development. It is revolutionary in three areas:


Smart: ONE learns from your listening habits. So the more you play, the smarter it gets.



Social: Connect ONE to your social networks, and post or tweet your favorite music discoveries.


Open: As a true crowd-powered device, ONE is built on open architecture and engages everyone that cares about music. 


Working together to build the best music experience for your home.
Music lovers: As a backer of the project you are an active member of our development team. We'll ask you for feedback frequently and let the community vote on key features, design issues and other exciting stuff. Your involvement doesn't stop once the product is shipped to you. We have put a ""Hotline"" function directly into the user interface, allowing you to submit feedback right from your Olive ONE touchscreen and directly to our engineers in San Francisco.
Artists: Our vision is that Olive ONE will become the platform of choice for you — beloved jazz ensembles, garage bands, and rock stars — to deliver Studio Master Quality recordings directly to their fans. The Open Music Platform serves as the backbone. We even plan to integrate crowdfunding functionality so you can fund your projects directly through ONE. A crowdfunded music player doing crowdfunding. How cool is that?
App Developers: Geeks unite! We will be providing a Software Development Kit that will allow you to take advantage of the powerful hard- and software platform and build the coolest music apps.
Graphic Designers and Creative artist: Our goal is to make ONE completely customizable (we need special machinery for this). So you can design your ONE in the most amazing colors and designs you can imagine. We are already in talks with some famous designers that would love to wrap ONE in their distinctive design patterns, but more about this later ...
Industrial Designers: Don't like our design? Tough luck (just kidding). While the first ONE is already designed, we are open to feedback from industrial designers on how to design our roadmap of great new products. So if you are one of the many talented designers out there. We love to hear from you, and will put your proposal up for vote! 
 
Everyone can participate! ONE looks good in any color.

Your personal Home Cloud
We have built HD music servers for more than 7 years, and love the benefits that come with an internal hard drive. That is why you can choose to get your ONE with an ultra-quiet 2.5” AV drive:

Enjoy instant access to your music, without buffering or relying on your internet connection, Mac or PC.


Use the Olive Home Cloud Service* to access all the music on your ONE, anywhere in the world. No monthly subscription fee.


Add time-shifting* to your internet radio. Play, pause, forward and rewind at any time. Or schedule recordings of your favorite show. Try this with your radio at home!


Automatically sync ONE* with your music libraries on your PC or Mac.


*Some features will be implemented via software update at a later point in time.

Sounds Amazing
Our team of audio engineers combines an impressive 150 years of experience in perfecting sound quality at Olive, and other leading audiophile brands. And they don't even look that old.   

The Abso!ute Sound, Editors' Choice ""The coolest thing since crushed ice!""What HiFi?, Editors' Choice ""Superb Hi-Fi sound quality!""
New York Times, David Pogue ""Olive has made an offer you can't refuse.""
WIRED magazine ""Olive has arrived to save us from mediocrity.""Rolling Stone magazine ""Gear of the year!""
With your help the new Olive ONE can deliver the same stunning sound quality, at an affordable price. The press thinks the same:

 

Designed by you. With the finest materials.
Can't argue about taste? We beg to differ and wrapped ONE in a solid aluminum and glass construction, not cheap plastic. The real cool thing however is that you can give it your personal touch by choosing a color, pattern or your own digital wallpaper. If we reach our extended goal of $1M we will buy some of the specialized machinery and equipment to custom-design the ONE to your liking. It’s your own limited edition ONE.

Customize your ONE with different colors and patterns!

We’re just getting warmed up.
If you like what we do and this campaign is successful we have many other great ideas: from a stackable speaker system to beautiful LED modules to invisible mounting. Join us to make them happen. 
 
The Olive ONE BOX is a single cabinet full-range stereo speaker. Add another Olive ONE BOX and experience stereo sound with perfect channel separation and soundstage. 

 ONE looks even good on your wall. Speakers can be mounted as well. 

Where Are We In the Development Process?
Though we were already working on a multi-room player in late 2008, the current design and open platform idea was born in October 2011. Today Olive ONE's revolutionary hard- and software platform and its beautiful design are almost finished, but it's ""only"" the infrastructure (or backbone). We need your ideas and direct participation to bring it to live. Here is what we have done so far and plan to do in the upcoming months:
 
ONE is not our first project. We have it all planned out.

We Need You
Without your help we will need to sell Olive ONE through our existing audiophile channel. This means it will ...

Be sold a considerably higher price,


At a much later time,


With much less features,


And without any customization possibilities.

By backing us now, you will become an active member of our development team, and help us realize the full potential of this great product concept.

Use of Funds
We have working prototypes and a supply chain that’s ready to go. We need your help to take the next step. We see the following funding milestones:

We will use the first $200,000 raised through the campaign to buy tooling and enhance our manufacturing. For cost-efficient manufacturing of the aluminum enclosure we need an expensive die cast tooling, and there are additional tools for the glass plate, connectors and cabling that add up quickly.


Get us to $650,000 and we will give every ONE free shipping.*


At $750,000 we will upgrade every backer to an extended 2 year warranty, up from the standard 1 year.*


At the goal of $1,000,000 we will we able to purchase some of the specialized machinery, equipment and hire additional staff required to customize some components of the Olive ONE to your personal preference.

 

Give the gift of crowdfunding!
The participation in creating Olive ONE is a great gift to give for any occassion. We have many perks at all price levels. All of them have one thing in common: they let you (or your loved one) participate in the greatest music revolution since Apple's iPod!
Here is a quick summary of our coolest perks:


$50 Gift Card: Your entry ticket to join the music revolution! You will be part of our development team and we will include you in all the decisions we put up for vote. Apply it to the purchase of an Olive ONE once it ships.



$100 Gift Card: Same as the $50 Gift Card, just twice the fun!


Limited quantities: Get your ONE for only $379. Plus FREE US shipping and Olive Care Program that extends the warranty to two years ($100 value). 

And by the way, we ship to 220 countries world-wide!


The People Behind Olive ONE
We are a team of music lovers, engineers and scientists that have built audiophile-grade HD Music Servers since 2005. Today Olive products are sold in more than 50 countries around the world, and we have developed a small but loyal fan base. Our company is based in the heart of San Francisco, at the intersection of technology, design, and music. And as crazy as it sounds, we also hand-built all our products here. With the introduction of Olive ONE we plan to bring our award-winning audiophile sound quality to everyone, and evolve into a truly customer-driven development and design center.

FAQ
Which countries do we ship to?
Olive ships to more than 220 countries worldwide.  If you are unsure that we ship to your country please contact us at info [at] olivehd.com and we will confirm. Please always add international freight costs to your perk (specified at each perk level).
Why does the Olive ONE sound better than any other digital music player out there?
If you’re an audiophile, you’ll be impressed by our 32-bit/384kHz Burr-Brown DAC and its dual HD amplifiers. If you’re not an audiophile, here’s all you need to know: Wow.
 Home Entertainment (USA)""The Olive sounded absolutely superb!""
WhatHi-Fi?, Editors' Choice (UK)""This is 21st century hi-fi: Superb to live with and listen to.""
Financial Times (UK)""A whole-house audio system capable of delivering top-quality sound.""
AudioVideo revolution (USA)""Excellent, punchy bass, plenty of soundstage depth, and great musical flow!""
STEREO, Reference Class (Germany)""Sound quality and design are top notch!""
The Sunday Morning Herald (Australia)""iPod-style convenience and optimum quality!""
How far are you in the development of Olive ONE and when will it be ready?
Pretty far. The hard- and software platform and the industrial design are basically done, and we have the first production samples already at our SF office (come by and see us!). Now we need your help to finish the software, buy tooling and expand our manufacturing capabilities. If all goes well we plan to ship the first ONE in July 2013.
How can I control the Olive ONE?
The Olive ONE can be controlled via the built-in touchscreen or our free iPhone, iPad and Android apps. Additionally you can view the user interface on the big screen, if your TV supports a standard web browser interface.
How do I know if I need a hard drive? 
If you have an existing digital music library (e.g. on your Mac or PC) and you don’t want to stream it, then get the version with the hard drive. If you have lots of CDs we recommend to take advantage of our pre-load service (we use a bunch of robots to load all your CDs onto your ONE.). At the end of the day, the hard drive makes you independent from the network. We are also working on a subscription-free Home Cloud Service that will let you access the music on your ONE, anywhere in the world. 
How can I customize my Olive ONE?
If we reach the $1M benchmark we will buy special machinery that allows you to define the color and pattern of the enclosure, glass surface and digital wallpaper. We have developed a cool customization tool that allows you to preview how your customized design will look like. You can even save those designs and share them with other backers (and enter a contest to win a prize).

<h2>HOW WAS THE HiFiCUBE CREATED?</h2>
<p>Our team was brainstorming new ideas when someone pointed out a photo cube and asked, “What if this wasn't just a photo cube, but also a speaker? We could use the Acryliprint™HD process and combine art and music to make something truly unique.” </p>

<p></p>
<p>We loved the idea, so our graphic art manager was tasked with coming up with a design. We all agreed that on top of just personalization, we wanted to bring to the market a high quality speaker. The three main attributes we identified as essential were stereo speakers, a great bass sound, and wireless connectivity.</p>

<h2>RISKS</h2>
<p>Through the years we’ve had several products manufactured overseas. With as much experience as we have under our belts, we have seen the ups and downs of overseas manufacturing. We feel we have done our due process in finding a reliable manufacturing partner that can deliver our HiFiCube speaker in time and with our established quality control levels.</p>
<p>There are always risks in production and delivery time. We have visited our manufacturing partner’s facility and have gone through great lengths to feel assured that the 3 to 4 week production time is reasonable and doable. We have verified that our manufacturing partner currently manufactures other high quality products and trust that the production of our product will have the same treatment. From past experiences we also feel that having one of our team members overseeing the production run and doing a final inspection of the HiFiCube before shipping will give us and our supporters added confidence for our expectations.</p>
<p>Possible delays not under our control could include minor delays in customs or unforeseen delays with shipping couriers. We have given ourselves enough of a cushion in our production and shipping schedule to allow for any issues or delays that may arise so that our product can reach our backers in time.</p>

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","CUBiCtunes is a division of AcrylicPress.com, a leading manufacturer of acrylic photo decor and full-color personalized acrylic keepsakes. We are an international team of photographers, graphic artists and acrylic manufacturers, representing over 60 years of photo art, design and acrylic manufacturing experience.
We'd like to introduce you to our first project, the HiFiCube™ - The first fully personalizable Bluetooth® speaker. The HiFiCube allows you to express yourself through your art, your style, and your music. We want to make a unique entertainment device that people will love, travel with, get excited about, and use regularly. To create this experience, we have to manufacture it with the best quality inside and out.

WHAT WILL THE HiFiCUBE HAVE?A sleek, futuristic, lightweight, and compact design that opens with a simple press
Multiple speakers for enhanced sound quality and boosted bass
High quality acrylic top binding a high-resolution acrylic print to the speaker
The ability to personalize your speaker like you would a mug or T-shirt
Bluetooth and auxiliary inputs with user-friendly controls and multiple pairing capability
The ability to charge from a miniUSB input


WHAT WILL MAKE THE HiFiCUBE UNIQUE?A unique innovation of the HiFiCube is its personalization capability. The top side of the cube can be customized to order, displaying any digital image professionally printed on high quality photographic paper. The image is then fused to crystal clear acrylic, a gorgeous, durable substrate.


Looking good only takes you so far, so we've made sure the HiFiCube sounds just as good as it looks. After several rounds of testing, our engineers felt confident giving our speaker the green light. We've shown our prototypes to a number of sound producers, musicians, and audiophiles and everyone's been very excited. The sound quality really shines through the speakers we've put into the HiFiCube and its audible range and volume are excellent.



WHAT ARE THE SPECS?Bluetooth® v2.1 wireless connection up to 30 feet
2x3W amplified speakers
Super bass enhancing subwoofer
60db Signal to Noise Ratio
100Hz - 20kHz Frequency Response
Long-lasting built-in lithium battery (10 hours of play time, rechargeable via included miniUSB to USB cable)
Microphone input
AUX 3.5MM audio input
User friendly controls for track selection, volume, and play/pause


WHAT IS THE PERSONALIZATION PROCESS?We create the top layer of the cube using an incredible process called Acryliprint HD, which uses a propietary technology to fuse a high-res inkjet photo print to a crystal clear acrylic substrate. The process is efficient and affordable using a specialized machine, which we already have in house. The prints come out consistently beautiful with amazing picture quality. The Acryliprint HD process also doesn't produce any byproducts harmful to our environment.


The square shape of the plate lends itself perfectly to album art, while patterns, photographs, Instagram shots, and artwork prints look just as great on it. If you can digitally upload it, we can incorporate it onto the HiFiCube.


WHERE CAN I USE THE HiFiCUBE?Sleek and inconspicuous, the HiFiCube's bluetooth capabilities and audio inputs make it incredibly versatile to use, as does its portability. Here's a few ways we've made use of the prototypes:
Create ambience while working or studying
Play energetic music at parties, and control the ""jukebox"" from anywhere in the house. Yeah, you'll hear it!
Get great sound quality for movies on your tablet
Listen to audiobooks and podcasts by the pool
Have a clearly audible speaker phone in a cellular conference call


WHY WE NEED INDIEGOGOAs mentioned above, we’ve manufactured our first run of sample prototypes.  Through IndieGoGo we are looking to raise funds for our first large scale production. Funds will be allocated to pay for materials and manufacturing costs with our partner overseas.  This first large production run will also be personally supervised by one of our team members. Complete shipment will be inspected before leaving our partners manufacturing facility to ensure the highest quality control.
STRETCH GOALS


$59,000 - ""Does it come in Black?"" If we achieve our first stretch goal, it will! At this goal, we'll begin production of the HiFiCube in black, with the same great personalization options.
$100,000 - Additional Colors - If we reach or exceed this goal, we'll develop HiFiCubes in different, vibrant color options with the same awesome personalization capabilities. We take requests!
$200,000 - Padded Carrying Case - If we reach this goal, we'll begin research and development on soft, padded carrying cases designed specifically to fit the HiFiCube and featuring the CUBiCtunes logo. 

TESTIMONIALS
We showed our prototype HiFiCubes to a number of musicians, sound engineers, and music fans and got an incredibly positive response. Check out some of the reactions in this video!

HOW WAS THE HiFiCUBE CREATED?
Our team was brainstorming new ideas when someone pointed out a photo cube and asked, “What if this wasn't just a photo cube, but also a speaker? We could use the Acryliprint™HD process and combine art and music to make something truly unique.” 



We loved the idea, so our graphic art manager was tasked with coming up with a design. We all agreed that on top of just personalization, we wanted to bring to the market a high quality speaker. The three main attributes we identified as essential were stereo speakers, a great bass sound, and wireless connectivity.



Having previous experience working with manufacturing partners overseas, we began looking for a dependable partner with a solid background in sound engineering to help us finalize our designs.






The design we ultimately settled on involves a sleek, minimalist cube shape which opens when pressed to reveal three speakers, user-friendly controls, and a futuristic suite of tones to communicate with the user. The speaker has tones to indicate when it is searching for a signal, when it has acquired one, and when its volume limit has been reached. 



Soon afterwards we were able to secure funds to manufacture the first shipment of prototypes. The response to these prototypes was absolutely awesome. Our speaker is fantastic. The quality of the sound, crisp and clear with an amazingly full-sounding bass range, not only blew us away but everyone we've shown it to as well. Having such a wonderful product with great personalization capability encouraged us to create our new division for audio technology products.

 The Board of the Joué Play comprises a body made of beech wood from sustainably managed forests. It’s designed, manufactured and assembled in France. It doesn’t contain any battery or perishable components. As for the silicon Pads, they are highly resistant and washable with water.Safely stored in its bag, your Joué Play will stay by your side for many years. 
 No need to be a computer whiz to use the Joué Play app!Everything is accessible from the main screen:

 The Joué Play comes in two different color schemes: Fire and Water. There is no functional difference between both, it's only aesthetic.Pleas note that having 8 Pads allows to add up to 8 instruments in a project (1 Pad = 1 instrument in the app).   
 Three years ago, we launched our first product: an expressive and modular MIDI controller for seasoned musicians, which is used today by many artists around the world.But lots of amateur musicians wanted to get their hands on it as well, and we felt frustrated that we couldn’t satisfy them, as current music software remains too complex to be apprehended easily.So we decided to create a new instrument that would enable anyone to start making music. An instrument that’s really easy to use and fun, while being sufficiently powerful and evolutive to take you far into your music creation. Introducing the Joué Play.  
  We are a team of passionate musicians scattered around the globe, with a base camp in Bordeaux, France. 
  Since childhood, I have been passionate about two things: music and technology. I co-designed my first instrument 15 years ago, the legendary Lemur, which has been used by many great artists around the world throughout the years.In 2015, at a turning point in my life, I came back to my piano that I hadn't touched for 8 years and started playing. The emotion I felt that day was so strong I thought that everyone should be able to feel it at some point in their life.So I started working on a new instrument that everyone could play regardless of their musical or technical background. An instrument combining the power and ease of the digital world with the beauty and feeling of the traditional world.The Joué Play was on its way.   

 
  
 At the crossroads of electronic machines and traditional instruments, Joué creates new types of instruments having the power & ease of the digital world coupled with the expressivity & beauty of the traditional world.Its modular Pads and lightweight but durable Boards can be used right out of the box in combination with the Joué Music app or plugged to any MIDI software.Based in Bordeaux, Joué designs and manufactures its instruments and components out of environmentally friendly materials in France.Its culture and production practices reflect a deep commitment to human creativity and environmental sustainability.Connect with us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube & LinkedIn.   
 At Joué, we’re used to work remotely, as our team has always been scattered around the world, across several locations in France and in the USA, and even in a van traveling around the world for some of us!The Covid-19 crisis mainly impacts us from a business point of view, like everyone else.However, we believe there has never been a better time to share our passion for making music and playing an instrument, as we are all stuck at home with more and more overlap between our professional and personal lives.Regarding the production of the hardware, all our suppliers are functioning and able to produce the devices, so we don’t expect much delay in our supply chain.",41.0,6,"1 Campaign

<li>Use Dubler to give<strong> human expression</strong> to digitally tracked instruments.</li>
<li>Train Dubler to <strong>non-vocal sounds</strong> such as <strong>clicking, clapping and stomping</strong> — Dubler’s training is sensitive enough to tell the difference between your left and right hand-click. </li>
<li>Manipulate 4 control dimensions, <strong>at the same time as playing a melody</strong> and <strong>simultaneously crafting the envelope</strong> of the audio. Only the voice can capture that level of expression!</li>
<li>Vocally <strong>control multiple MIDI effects whilst sending pitch information.</strong> You could map vocal sounds to control different chord effects in your DAW. For example, you can set it up so an ‘ooohhh’ makes a single note into a Major chord and 'eeeeeee’ makes a single note into a Minor chord. Then if you sing “ooohhh eeeeeee ooohhh ooohhh” You’ll get Major, Minor, Major, Major.</li>

Watch Liam demo how to create a whole track with JUST YOUR VOICE! Dubler Studio Kit is a real-time vocal recognition MIDI controller. Our kit offers up a never seen before way to translate your musical ideas into reality, using the one instrument you’ve been practising since birth— the voice. The kit comes as—
 The Dubler software — a virtual MIDI instrument (a desktop application for Mac + PC) Compatible with any production software [DAW]. It is not a plugin or VST. 
 The Dubler microphone  — a low latency custom USB mic, tuned for the Dubler software.
 

 All you need to make music is a computer, a DAW, headphones and Dubler Studio Kit.
  As musicians we all sing, hum, and record voice memos to track snippets of ideas – but that’s often where that idea ends, never making it into the studio or onto the stage. Our goal: To help you to release the stems of musical ideas trapped inside your head and get them directly into your production software— simply by vocalising them. Now anyone can turn their voice directly into MIDI— quickly, easily, intuitively and LIVE.  
Here we're using the Dubler Studio Kit with Native's Battery 4 sampler to trigger organ and drum sounds simultaneous with beatboxing.

 Whilst our campaign is live, we’ll be continuing to test Dubler Studio Kit with musicians in their daily, music-making lives to ensure that we get the best product possible to you. Keep an eye out in our updates and across our social channels for more >>>     
 With Dubler Studio Kit, effects, notes and samples are controlled absolutely live based on the timbre of your voice, not applied by post-processing like some other voice-to-MIDI solutions. Dubler Studio Kit the ultimate multi-dimensional MIDI controller— think of it as a MIDI keyboard and an MPC rolled into one, but controlled using the voice! 
Dubler learns your voice in under 60 seconds. 

 
That enables you to: Select and trigger samples: Use beatboxing sounds to trigger drum samples or click, clap, or tap to trigger any virtual instrument or sample in your DAW. This includes velocity control and envelope following. ?


 
Synth control: Control pitch, velocity, envelope and pitch bend all totally live by singing and humming. ?

 
Effects control: The timbre of your voice (eg; ‘hmmm’, ‘laaa’ and ‘ooohh’) control 4 CC MIDI dials. Map these to any effects, filters, synth or DAW parameters you like. ?

Advanced control: Use in conjunction with loops, other MIDI instruments, for post produced automation... and loads more! ?

 


Dubler Studio Kit allows you to capture things that would otherwise be impossible with traditional desk-bound MIDI inputs. 


Take ideas for beats, melodies and musical compositions from your head directly into your production software [DAW]. 

Augment live beatboxing performances with virtual instruments and synths. 

 Vocally control multiple parameters and effects of a synth, in real-time, as you lay down the melody two-handed on a MIDI keyboard.

Play a guitar part and simultaneously sketch out the rhythm for the corresponding drum track, vocally.


Luna Neptune- [Left to right] 1. Triggering synths with her voice, whilst playing guitar. 2. Micing up a guitar and using it's output as a MIDI trigger. 3. Using clicking as a trigger.

Use Dubler to give human expression to digitally tracked instruments.
Train Dubler to non-vocal sounds such as clicking, clapping and stomping — Dubler’s training is sensitive enough to tell the difference between your left and right hand-click. 
Manipulate 4 control dimensions, at the same time as playing a melody and simultaneously crafting the envelope of the audio. Only the voice can capture that level of expression!
Vocally control multiple MIDI effects whilst sending pitch information. You could map vocal sounds to control different chord effects in your DAW. For example, you can set it up so an ‘ooohhh’ makes a single note into a Major chord and 'eeeeeee’ makes a single note into a Minor chord. Then if you sing “ooohhh eeeeeee ooohhh ooohhh” You’ll get Major, Minor, Major, Major.

​These are just a few examples - we can’t wait to see how much further you will take it!




Note: Packaging design is yet to be finalised and may differ slightly from this.

It also allows you to map triggers to different MIDI events. Planning to use Dubler on stage? We’ve built in noise resistance algorithms to avoid accidental drum triggers in noisy environments. 10ms LATENCYWe get lots of questions on latency. We’ve run several end-to-end tests, and land at a mean latency of approximately 10ms. [Note: This is before sending out MIDI — the MIDI and the DAW will likely add a further 5-10ms on top of that.]The example test below lands at 11.5ms, which is low enough to feel unnoticeable.Simulation of end to end latency in Dubler. These are used in our tests to maintain our app quality in new builds. The two humps happen when an onset sounds falls at the end of a prepared audio buffer. Minimum System Requirements:
macOS X 10.12 or later
Windows 7 or later (Windows 10 recommended)
Intel Core i5 CPU or equivalent
4GB RAM (8GB or more recommended)
OpenGL-capable graphics 
100MB free disk space
To ensure the best possible experience on Windows, we are creating a custom low-latency ASIO driver for the Dubler microphone. This will make the user experience much simpler and avoid the issues associated with using a generic driver like ASIO4ALL.Our low-latency USB microphone has been custom designed for use with Dubler software. We use a high-end microphone capsule and a built-in audio interface. This enables us to fine-tune the Dubler software for a known input. This way we can ensure a reliable, accurate and low latency out-of-the-box experience for our users. We are working with a highly respected microphone manufacturer to produce the devices and have selected components that are optimal for our use case. For example, the Dubler microphone has a double shock housing to reduce accidental MIDI triggers resulting from handling noise.Being USB it’s great for being at home, in the studio or on the road— and you don’t need a separate audio interface to use it. The Dubler Microphone.

We’ve now finalised all functionality and our most recent pre-launch beta kits are already in use with a bunch of international artists and producers. It’s been a long process of R&D, building, testing, long nights and music-filled days, but, with a lot of excitement, we can now say we’re truly ready for launch. We can’t wait to see the Dubler Studio Kit in the hands of musicians, producers and performers all over the world. The idea for Dubler Studio Kit started out as a university project for Vochlea Music founder, George, whilst studying at the Royal College of Art in London. Since then, he’s been an Enterprise Fellow at The Royal College of Engineering (‘17-’18), been a finalist in the Interaction Design Awards (‘17), a SXSW Audio & Music Innovation finalist (‘17) and won the SXSW Accelerator Pitch (‘18)— all with his vocal recognition technology for music making, Dubler.  George presenting Dubler at the Abbey Road Demo Day 2018 Some imagery from our development over the past 3 years.George's original idea sketches for the Dubler Microphone from 2015.

<p><strong>BIG AIWA SOUND</strong><br/>The Exos-X8 is two things - Big.  And loud. It pushes major wattage through a reflex-ported 8” woofer and high-performance 3” tweeter. But Aiwa sound doesn't sacrifice sound quality for volume - with a wide, even frequency response and low distortion, you’ll hear every detail… even down the street.</p>
<p>With a high-accuracy class-D amplifier, custom-designed dual-magnet woofer, tweeter, and crossover, and 12+ hours of battery, the X8 will fuel the fun wherever you go!</p>
<p>We have a very simple formula for delivering better products: we put your money into what matters, into the hardware itself.  We don't waste money on fancy packaging, inefficient sales channels or celebrity endorsements, and you can hear the difference. </p>

<p><strong>WHO IS AIWA?</strong><br/>Aiwa is a small team with decades of experience in consumer electronics and audio. We're not the Aiwa you might remember from decades past - we have no affiliation with the ""old"" Aiwa or their corporate parent Sony. We relaunched the brand in 2015 to give the brand a new home to honor the ethos of creating incredible sounding audio products. We did that with some of the top-rated speakers and headphones on Amazon, including the Exos-9 (shown below), and we'd encourage you to read the reviews of both our products and our customer service.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT WE BELEIVE</strong><br/>Aiwa believes that music is at the core of what makes us human.  For thousands of years, all music was a group activity - whenever there was music, we sang, danced, or played instruments together. There were no musicians or audiences, it was just us. This inspires our approach to speakers - they are for bringing people together, getting involved with the music, and making memories.</p>

<p><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>The Exos-X8 is not a one-off, luxury-grade, handcrafted speaker. It's a speaker for everyday life, real parties, and bringing with you wherever you go. It's a product Aiwa is bringing to market with the full benefit of its mature supply chain and full economies of scale (and the bang for your buck reflects that).  So why Indiegogo?  Feedback from our customers is extremely valuable. We want to give special benefits to the early adopters who get in first and help guide the direction of the product and company.  Indiegogo is the best way to do that.  We're raising $40,000 in early orders to help speed up delivery of the X8 to your doorstep. </p>

</div></div>","Nanoplug is 100% invisible hearing aid, instant-fit,   appropriate for people with mild to moderately-severe hearing loss. 
 Nanoplug is a high-tech product adjustable in the privacy of your own home. Suitable for use with mobile  phones,  as well.  Most  importantly,  affordable.Nanoplug allows you to keep your hearing loss secret with no noticeable  change to your appearance.No one will know why you’re hearing better except you.
  




  
 
A huge leap forward in design, eliminating embarrassment and social stigma.
    



 Change lives by revolutionizing the Hearing Aid Industry. 


To do so, we aimed at eliminating the top complaints people have with current hearing aids.            
     

     

The goal at Nanoplug was change lives by creating an affordable, invisible, instant-fitting, user programmable and better quality hearing aid than ever seen before.

    
Nanoplug team was founded with the belief that the hearing aid industry needs a reinvention and refresh. With technological progress of the 21st century, hearing aids
shouldn’t cost $2,000, come in antiquated designs, or be tedious to obtain. 




Nanoplug is comprised of micro-components and nano-battery, allowing for a hearing aid  at a fraction of the size of  the next  smallest on the market.  





With a cell that is only nanometers in dimension, the nanobattery can be configured and connected to scale the output of power by accessing groups of cells into different sized banks, allowing for a variable output that transcends all boundaries and spans all applications. 
Additionally, with its extremely high surface to volume ratio, it provides a virtually instantaneous recharge. Batteries contain no toxic chemicals or heavy metals providing safety  while being  eco-friendly. They are  integrated and  rechargeable.
Battery would give 138.888 hours runtime (6 days before recharging).

 




Nanoplug  captures sound in the same way that your ears were designed to do.  
 
Device gently preserves and amplifies sounds so that what you hear is always clear, and you will be able to participate confidently in all situations.
 
Nanoplug positioning reduces the risk of internal feedback and wind noise, allowing active users to comfortably enjoy the sounds around them.





The benefit of the Nanoplug is that it keeps your ear canal open which is important for localizing sounds because the perception of sounds depends heavily on whether it comes from the back, the side or the front as the sound is influenced by the pinna and the ear canal.    


 









Acous-Tap technology allows you to program your Nanoplug for up to 4 different environment (noise) settings.
Simply pat your ear and Nanoplug will switch through your personal, preset programs to adapt to your current situation and noise levels.



Nanoplug could be programmed for a noisy restaurant, walking or enjoying the outdoors, watching TV, etc.





Before your Nanoplug hearing aids are sent to you, they are programmed to meet your specific hearing requirements.
Making Nanoplug unique, you will also receive a Hearing Aid Programmer, allowing for adjustments in the privacy of your own home.







Nanoplug's high tech adjustable hearing aids places the ability to make programming adjustments in the hands of the consumer. 





Hearing aid manufacturers will not provide this kind of programming option because they do not want you to have control of your own hearing aids.

 You need to enter your audiogram. Based on the audiogram information entered,  ""auto fit"" program will automatically provide a ""first fit"" for the sound settings. Then you can make adjustments to the hearing aids. It really couldn't be easier.




A comfortable fit, no matter what size your ear canals are, even for people with small, thin and short ear canals.






Easy to insert and easy to remove.
  





Nanoplug is very powerful device based on the latest generation of microchips. It was built by a team of audiologists, engineers, and industrial designers.
Nanoplug device guarantees high quality sound,  while lasting for  6 days without recharging.


Nanoplug hearing aid has three basic parts: a microphone, microchip and  receiver. 


Small microphone collect sounds from the environment. A microchip converts the incoming sound into digital code. Then it analyzes and adjusts the sound based on your hearing loss, listening needs and the level of the sounds around you. The signals are then converted back into sound waves and delivered to your ears through receiver.




Nanoplug also reduced the size of the cover by micro  injection molding. Micro injection molding is a processing technology using extremely high pressure and speed in  producing very small  and  accurate molded  parts. 
       


Micro injection molding is widely suited for most of raw materials ranging from high-temperature resistant engineering plastics to commodity resins. Thin wall injection molding can produce walls as thin as 0.3 mm.




Nanoplug is not a mere project.  The frame prototype is already fully developed.  

We have spent more than a year designing and developing Nanoplug with the leading  audiologists, engineers, and industrial designers. 




Your  support is crucial for  Nanoplug to get through the next  steps of  tooling  and commercial production, outlined in our schedule below.






Nanoplug is more than just a product: it is a step in the right direction to change  the lives of people everywhere, for the better.

</div></div>","The Most Advanced WiFi Speaker, JookBox Broadcasts Its Own Network
JookBox WiFi speakers are custom designed to fill every room in your home with vibrant sound. Our cutting-edge, full-range drivers deliver deep, crystal-clear high fidelity acoustics. Each JookBox broadcasts its own dedicated WiFi network which is used to communicate with other JookBox speakers. The best part? You don’t need to connect JookBox to your home WiFi network or buy additional hubs. Just use the JookBox app to stream all the music on earth, on up to 10 JookBox speakers at the same time. You can even create a collaborative playlist and let your friends effortlessly queue and play their own music by enabling  party mode!""While I think the JookBox app itself would have been a sufficient innovation, the creators weren't content with stopping there, so they also invented the JookBox speaker."" - CNET
""In the cut-throat market of wireless speakers, the trick of the trade is being original."" - Digital Trends

""JookBox social speaker shifts the music sharing paradigm by allowing guests and hosts to fine-tune the playlist socially."" - PSFK




Don't let the small size fool you. The crystal-clear acoustics that emit from JookBox make every other speaker on the market sound flat and one-dimensional. The two-driver setup with dedicated Class-D digital amplifier delivers rich and full-bodied sound for a true HiFi music experience. These incredibly versatile, full-range drivers allows for high resolution audio playback, with no loss in quality.


Unlike our competition, we did not want to create a compact speaker that only utilized a combination of tweeter, mid-range driver or mid-woofer. We could never settle for a speaker that sounded dull and boring. Our goal was clear and simple; to create an acoustic marvel. And that's exactly what we did. The pitch-perfect sound of JookBox is achieved by engineering state-of-the-art, dual 2.5’’ full-range drivers from the ground up.








Full-range drivers allow JookBox to re-create acoustics that stretch across the entire audible sound spectrum. Reaching deep for those heart-felt lows, all the way up to angelic highs, JookBox makes music feel like it's being performed live, right in your home. We also made sure that JookBox did not suffer from the typical negatives of full-range drivers, like low output abilities and limited frequency response. We custom designed our drivers to have:





Best in-class frequency response.

Powerful loudspeaker output.

Next to no distortion.










While designing JookBox we knew it could be so much more than just a great sounding speaker, so we put our heads together and created something incredible. What we developed is a revolutionary new way to stream audio on multiple speakers simultaneously over WiFi without connecting to your router. 



Our cutting-edge WiFi chipset allows each JookBox speaker to broadcast its own dedicated 2.4GHz WiFi network that we call JookNet. Using a dedicated network ensures a consistent audio experience without delays, skips, or drops caused by streaming music on overcrowded home networks. JookBox also supports Apple AirPlay and DLNA.







The JookBox App connects to each JookBox speaker through JookNet on a separate wireless channel so you don't have to connect to your home WiFI network. Use the app on your smartphone, tablet, or WiFi enabled device to control the music from up to 100 feet away.





JookBox is the only WiFI speaker that is truly portable. Since you don’t need to connect JookBox to a WiFi network, you can listen to your favorite music everywhere, even while you’re hanging out at the pool.









JookBox is the most advanced multi-room speaker system ever developed. You can listen to a different song in each room, group rooms together, or hear the same music everywhere. JookBox can play music on up to 10 speakers at the same time without external hardware. Connecting multiple JookBox speakers forms a secure AES encrypted, dynamic peer-to-peer wireless mesh network.







JookBox was designed to be beautiful, highly functional, and sound incredible with the versatility to adorn any space. Its vibrant color scheme, compact size, and lack of messy cords makes JookBox the perfect accessory to compliment any decor.



JookBox is very easy to set up through the JookBox App. Press and hold the logo on the front of the speaker for 3 seconds and JookBox will show up on the app. Then tap to connect. After JookBox is connected you can create a room to quickly access and control what music is playing. Expanding your JookBox speaker system is even easier. Just connect your new speakers, select which rooms they go in, and you’re all set.








The JookBox App lets you manage your playlist queue and set the mood around your home. Choose how loud you want each room, which song is playing, and edit the play queue for each room on the fly.




JookBox is the only WiFi speaker system that gives you complete control of your home listening experience without connecting to an external hub. When connected to a WiFi network, each JookBox speaker can act as a WiFi repeater  and increase the range of JookNet by 100 feet. This means that you can play the same song on every speaker from up to 1000 feet away. 





JookBox speakers can be paired with near perfect sound channel synchronization for true stereo sound. Each speaker can stream separate Left & Right channels to create an immersive 5.1 surround sound, home theatre experience.




JookBox can also stream from today's most popular streaming services like Netflix and Hulu or internet videos on YouTube, JookBox can play audio from any video source your WiFi enabled smart device can access. You can even plug your Apple TV, cable box, or Playstation into JookBox and your TV for captivating home theatre audio performance.





The JookBox App is what really sets JookBox apart and is the best way to organize and enjoy the music you love from any device. Play your favorite songs, explore new music, and create collaborative playlists at your next party.
Activate party mode and invite friends to queue and play their own music by adding their favorite songs to your collaborative playlist. You have control over who gets to access your playlist and how many songs they can submit to the queue. If you don’t like a song one of your friends added, you can quickly remove it from the playlist or slide it down to play it later. 



The party is just a tap away with the JookBox App. Search and play any song from your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Check who added the next song, get all the info on the song that's currently playing, and see which songs have already been played.












Check out this quick video that shows how your friend can request access to your party playlist and play their own song.



Play all the music on earth or quickly search for the next song. Find anything you want to hear from your local library or across all the music services you use in one place, at the same time. The JookBox App currently integrates with the most popular music streaming and internet radio services like Spotify, iTunes, 8tracks, and Pandora. More streaming service integrations are coming soon!

It had to sound great, look stylish, play music for hours, and it couldn’t cost an arm and a leg. Our original vision hasn’t changed from the time we came up with the concept and drafted our initial sketches.




Achieving our goal began with turning our concept sketches into working prototypes. After months of intense research, multiple prototype designs, and numerous meetings with sound engineers, we finally knew what we had to do. 


The first JookBox prototype is born.

Aldo is also our lead graphic designer whose eye for design and photoshop skills are second to none. Aldo is working on the PCB layout and manufacturing preparation for JookBox, as well as overseeing the engineering design process.


Mike has a long history of strong leadership practices and a deep practical engineering experience that helps provide direction for our team. Even though Mike is a zealous free thinker, and inspires some of our most innovative ideas, he always manages to keep our priorities clear and in focus.



Jesse Caruso is the man behind the scenes connecting all the dots to keep BSX running efficiently. He is extremely detail oriented and meticulously crafts the organizational architecture and flow of BSX. Jesse leverages his extensive business knowledge and experience to handle every aspect of the business.


Moe balances marketing, operations, and brand awareness like a true boss. He helps create everything behind the curtains at BSX in every aspect of the business from constructing the system architecture to creating Facebook ads.

Sinisa is an extremely detail oriented designer that has created everything from the appearance of JookBox’s enclosure to the experience of opening the packaging. Although he excels in rapid prototype development and facilitating collaboration among the team, Sinisa never skips a step in the design process.


Hudson's impeccable ear for audio imperfections and passion to fix them has magnified the sound quality of JookBox to levels we did not think were possible. He’s a true artist at positioning hardware components inside audio device enclosures to deliver vibrant sound that is both immersive and moving. Hudson is a classical music audiophile, and will only endorse the final speaker design when it can produce a sound experience with the realism of live music.

Streaming crystal-clear audio from a range of over 30 feet and a play time of 8 hours on a single battery charge.</p>
<p><strong>Rugged, Waterproof and Tough Design</strong></p>
<p>Your Big Turtle Shell Ultra is built with a rugged, waterproof housing so you no longer have to be afraid of taking your speaker off of your coffee table and into the wild. The Big Turtle Shell Ultra was built for adventure, it's begging you to take it to the extreme corners of the world, but it will settle for your summer pool party if that's the best you can throw at it. That is right, drop it in the pool and listen away.</p>

<p>The Big Turtle Shell Ultra is capable of 360° omnidirectional stereo sound.

This primary beam is then emitted by the loudspeaker, propagates in the air and self-demodulates to reconstitute the audible audio signal.<br/><br/>Now you may ask yourself, how can sound be emitted through a constrained zone, instead of going in every direction ? Well, because of the self-demodulation effect that appears on each point of the primary beam, the demodulated waves act as a virtual array, interacting with each other inside a secondary beam that keeps the same directivity properties than the ultrasonic primary beam.<br/><br/>In the end, sound travels out from the <b>« A »</b> speaker in a narrowly focused column, like a flashlight beam.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457545472/rsp0ajylpsxvdre2gw8y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457878418/rxaggdsk4p0zdutacn0q.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457725088/o8vxing0mrbmgvlxeu2y.png"" src="""" style=""width: 504.452px;height: 594px;""/><br/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457725448/jigbbnrrqn2mfxovvszy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457880302/dgxvbebotpbhgn3uljuk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457878448/p2a8pprxusqknxdcrvod.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457878561/ayrflplbd2vn4iew52hh.png"" src="""" style=""width: 508.25px;height: 598px;""/><br/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457878613/ymhljlvewqiwohisb5vv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457880330/vmcqexvi1xxy63lfxhxj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457546656/bmhcr1ksijqhaijlowpq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Whether you'd like to set <b>« A »</b> on your desk or fix it to a wall, it's all possible with our accessories.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457624468/gg8aorlzehkbsdx9dt6y.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 447.598px;height: 271px;""/><br/> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  <br/><b>NOTE</b> : <b>« A »</b> automatically comes with a stand.

<p><i>Purchasers</i> are responsible for any VAT or customs duties levied by their own countries.<br/><br/>UE residents, VAT costs (20%) are added directly to shipping costs.</p> <strong>What’s in the box ? </strong> <br/>Here’s a list of everything that comes with your « A » :<br/>« A » Speaker<br/>Charging cable<br/>3.5mm stereo mini-jack<br/><br/><b>What are the main differences between « A » Original and « A » Junior ?</b><br/>The main difference is that Junior is half the size of Original. Therefore, its beam of sound is tighter and volume is less loud. Junior is more adapted for a proximity use (on a desk for instance). Original can be used for longer distances.<br/><br/><b>I can't read the Directivity Diagrams. Can you help ?</b><br/>These diagrams are an illustration of the sound level (in decibels) depending on your position from the axis of the speaker (in degrees).<br/>Let’s take the Original’s diagram as an example : at approx. 20° from the axis of the speaker, we measure a 30dB loss.<br/><br/><b>I can’t read the Frequency Response tables.

</div></div>","Imagine a speaker that only you can hear, even if there are a bunch of other people in the room. Akoustic Arts' « A » speaker is the world’s most advanced directional speaker. It creates a narrow beam of sound, the same way that a laser creates a beam of light to focus on a precise area, allowing you to blast sound directly into your ears from across the room without anyone else hearing it.                                             ""A speaker that only you can hear, even if there are a bunch of other people in the room."" – Wired""The « A » speaker is one of those fabulous creations that your brain tells you is completely impossible, even while you’re listening to it. (...) When the speaker isn’t aimed directly at you, you don’t hear it at all."" – Stuff""When I was a foot away from that speaker, I was off to the side. But, when I walked a couple steps and got directly in front of the speaker, I could hear the audio clearly and loudly. That’s the awesome part about this speaker — you can crank up the volume without disturbing anyone else."" – Chipchik""This speaker allows you to listen to music alone, without bothering anyone else around. Out of the sound beam, it’s impossible to hear anything, even if you are in the same room."" – Le Figaro""You don’t need headphones anymore to stay in a bubble in the middle of the living-room !"" – Science&Vie(Retrouvez une revue de presse en français ici) Whether you’re at work, in your bedroom, or in your living room, the possibilities are endless. Here are just a few ways to enjoy « A » :                               Watch a late night movie without disturbing anyone                        Enjoy music quietly while staying alert to your surroundings             Enjoy your contents privately at work without distracting your colleagues                                  Play to your games without those annoying headphones                                             Enjoy your music discreetly in your bedroomNOTE: The version used for the photos is « A » Original.         
 
 
  « A » is available in two versions :- Original (20x20cm / 8"" sq.)- Junior (9x9cm / 3.5"" sq.)  In the back, you can easily fix « A » to a stand or wall-mount.« A » gets plugged through its core. There are two line input/output so you can plug in your smartphone to the first one and link up another « A » through the second.       Nothing's easier than setting up your « A »
Open the box
Connect the battery
Plug in the charging cable to the speaker
Connect the speaker to your device (smartphone, tablet, laptop...)
  Like any other external speaker, you can connect « A » to any of your audio devices through a 3.5mm mini-jack : smartphones, tablets, computers, stereos, TVs, mp3 players…  (Version française ici)What’s the secret behind the « A » speaker ? « A » uses revolutionary ultrasonic technology to point sound directly at one listener, while excluding everyone nearby.Inside the beam, you hear sound.Outside, you hear nothing.       Let’s get scientific !The « A » speaker works in an entirely different way from conventional loudspeakers. The biggest difference is it does not produce ordinary sound waves with a single, moving electromagnetic coil and cone. Instead, it generates ultrasonic waves (high-frequency sound waves) that are then turned into audible sound waves.                                           As you can see on the above figure, the primary beam is generated by transposing the audio signal into the ultrasonic domain. This primary beam is then emitted by the loudspeaker, propagates in the air and self-demodulates to reconstitute the audible audio signal.Now you may ask yourself, how can sound be emitted through a constrained zone, instead of going in every direction ? Well, because of the self-demodulation effect that appears on each point of the primary beam, the demodulated waves act as a virtual array, interacting with each other inside a secondary beam that keeps the same directivity properties than the ultrasonic primary beam.In the end, sound travels out from the « A » speaker in a narrowly focused column, like a flashlight beam.                                                    Whether you'd like to set « A » on your desk or fix it to a wall, it's all possible with our accessories.                                  NOTE : « A » automatically comes with a stand. If you want a wall-mount instead, please send us an email after your purchase at contact@akoustic-arts.comIMPORTANT : Le « A » arrivera chez accompagné d'un stand. Si vous voulez une fixation murale à la place, merci de nous en informer après votre achat sur contact@akoustic-arts.com                                          Soon, you will also find « A » outside your house, because we truly believe in the power of sound. In fact, we're on a mission to finally get sound to ease and enhance our daily lives, while avoiding sound pollution : We’d love to adapt « A » to your ideas and give you the best private listening experience possible. Leave us a comment with your suggestions !      Akoustic Arts is a French startup created in 2010 by Ilan Kaddouch and headquartered in Paris, France. The « A » speaker is its first consumer product and is based on significant acoustic engineering experience. After three years of intensive R&D, they are proud to introduce you to « A », the world's most advanced directional speaker.

<p><span>While on a trip to San Francisco, Dhaval had a long conversation with a friend who told him about his experiences with working in a co-working space. He told Dhaval about his habit of listening to podcasts during work and about the many times that someone had come up to him to talk to him while he was in the middle of a podcast. Naturally, he would then take out his earphones and talk to whoever came up to him, but he would always get frustrated when realizing that his podcast had progressed to a completely different part in the meantime. That’s when Dhaval had the idea for SenCbuds - earphones that would pause what you were listening to once you take them out of your ears!</span></p>
<p>The more Dhaval thought about his idea, the more it became evident that this would not just be convenient during working hours, but also in the gym, outdoors or while travelling.</p>

<p><span><b>When will I receive my SenCbuds?</b></span></p>
<p><span>Our goal is to process and ship all rewards within six months of being funded. This will give us time to make sure everything is in order, that we have all necessary materials in-hand and that the earphones we’re sending out to our backers are of the best quality possible.</span></p>
<p><b>Which devices can I use my SenCbuds with?</b></p>
<p>We’ve equipped SenCbuds with a handy iOS/Android switch, which enables you to use them with virtually any smartphone, tablet or laptop. Just plug SenCbuds into your device, flip the switch to the appropriate platform and enjoy!</p>
<p><b>Do my SenCbuds come with a warranty?</b></p>
<p>Yep! SenCbuds will be shipped including a one-year warranty covering any defects or malfunctions. The warranty will not cover misuse or user-inflicted damages, such as modifications, however.</p>
<p><b>What’s all included in the box?</b></p>
<p>When you receive your SenCbuds package, it will include the reward you selected, one cord housing component, one pair of silicone cap replacements for the earbuds, and, of course, a set of instructions.</p>
<p><b>What is the average battery life of my SenCbuds?</b></p>
<p>SenCbuds were designed to last longer than two weeks on a single battery charge! In our initial stages of testing, we’ve even experienced lifespans of up to 17 days.</p>
<p><b>Will my SenCbuds still work once the battery died?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely! When the battery is low or dead, SenCbuds revert to being regular earbuds! The sensor will not detect your motions once the battery is drained, but you can still pause and play manually, when listening to your tunes or watching Netflix.</p>
<p><b>How do I charge my SenCbuds?</b></p>
<p>There is a USB charging port built into the housing frame of the cord coil. All you need to do to charge your SenCbuds, is using the included USB adapter with your available power source!</p>
<p><b>How is the sound quality of SenCbuds?</b></p>
<p>SenCbuds were designed to be more than just intuitive - we also wanted to create earphones that have the most excellent audio quality possible. That’s why we equipped SenCbuds with 9mm drivers, sensitivity to 98DB, an impedance of 16Ω and a frequency range of 5Hz to 25kHz.</p>
<p><b>Do my SenCbuds have a microphone?</b></p>
<p>Yes, SenCbuds have a built-in microphone. It allows you to use them as a headset for all your smart devices!</p>
<b>What is the Smart Sense Technology (SST) that powers SenCbuds?</b><p>The sensor that gives your SenCbuds their unique functionality is a patent-pending, proprietarily designed smart sensor.

Join us and take the way you listen to music to the next level!Headphones and earphones have been improved and optimized immensely in the past few years. It is nowadays common that you can play and pause your music by pushing a built-in button and that you can use most earphones as a headset as well. Now, it’s time for earphones to reach their next evolutionary step!Meet SenCbuds, the first earphones that can automatically detect when to pause your music. Using patent pending sensor technology, SenCbuds recognize when they are taken out of your ear, and pause the music you are listening to, or the movie you are watching, accordingly!




Smart Sense Technology
SenCbuds unique functionality is powered by motion-sensitive, patent pending Smart Sense Technology (SST).




Smart Sense Technology allows SenCbuds to instantly pause your music when you take them out of your ear, and to restart it when you put them back in.
 
Cable Management System
All SenCbuds come with a convenient management system to avoid tangled cables! It also comes with buttons that you can use to control your music and accept calls manually in case the battery of your SenCbuds died.

 

Superior Sound Quality
When creating SenCbuds, we wanted to produce earphones that offer the most excellent audio quality possible. We wanted to equip SenCbuds with the most advanced compatible technology in order to provide clear and powerful sound! 
SenCbuds' Audio Specifications:

9mm Drivers
Sensitivity to 98DB
Impedance of 16Ω
Frequency Range of 5Hz to 25kHz

SenCbuds Plus

If you get our SenCbuds Plus, your earphones will also be equipped with a gold plated audio jack, a do-not-disturb light and noise isolation through memory foam earbuds!








Shipping Costs

While on a trip to San Francisco, Dhaval had a long conversation with a friend who told him about his experiences with working in a co-working space. He told Dhaval about his habit of listening to podcasts during work and about the many times that someone had come up to him to talk to him while he was in the middle of a podcast. Naturally, he would then take out his earphones and talk to whoever came up to him, but he would always get frustrated when realizing that his podcast had progressed to a completely different part in the meantime. That’s when Dhaval had the idea for SenCbuds - earphones that would pause what you were listening to once you take them out of your ears!
The more Dhaval thought about his idea, the more it became evident that this would not just be convenient during working hours, but also in the gym, outdoors or while travelling.


Now, approximately one year later, the basic development of the earphones is done and we are ready to bring SenCbuds to all the people who share our daily frustrations! Join us, and become part of the SenCbuds story!


Dhaval is a software engineer from New Zealand and the inventor of SenCbuds. Besides coming up with the idea, Dhaval is in charge of having SenCbuds become a reality, which means that he handles project management, fulfilment and everything else that comes up!

Bas is an industrial designer from the Netherlands and responsible for SenCbuds’ amazing product design. He has spent hours and hours on ensuring that your SenCbuds provide the best user experience, durability and aesthetics possible!



















Earphones are as much a matter of style and preference as they are bound to the technology that powers them. We want to provide a product that is of the best possible quality in every aspect, which is why we have allowed sufficient time for testing in our timeline. Nonetheless, we do face risk that the prototype tests reveal bugs or errors resulting in optimizations, and thus leading to delays in our delivery plan.
While we are confident that our team’s vast experience in all relevant fields is extensive to overcome all challenges that might come up, we have lined-up partnerships with leading specialist in all critical areas of our fulfilment process. Therefore, we are confident that we can handle all the risks associated with the development of SenCbuds.





When will I receive my SenCbuds?
Our goal is to process and ship all rewards within six months of being funded. This will give us time to make sure everything is in order, that we have all necessary materials in-hand and that the earphones we’re sending out to our backers are of the best quality possible.
Which devices can I use my SenCbuds with?
We’ve equipped SenCbuds with a handy iOS/Android switch, which enables you to use them with virtually any smartphone, tablet or laptop. Just plug SenCbuds into your device, flip the switch to the appropriate platform and enjoy!
Do my SenCbuds come with a warranty?
Yep! SenCbuds will be shipped including a one-year warranty covering any defects or malfunctions. The warranty will not cover misuse or user-inflicted damages, such as modifications, however.
What’s all included in the box?
When you receive your SenCbuds package, it will include the reward you selected, one cord housing component, one pair of silicone cap replacements for the earbuds, and, of course, a set of instructions.
What is the average battery life of my SenCbuds?
SenCbuds were designed to last longer than two weeks on a single battery charge! In our initial stages of testing, we’ve even experienced lifespans of up to 17 days.
Will my SenCbuds still work once the battery died?
Absolutely! When the battery is low or dead, SenCbuds revert to being regular earbuds! The sensor will not detect your motions once the battery is drained, but you can still pause and play manually, when listening to your tunes or watching Netflix.
How do I charge my SenCbuds?
There is a USB charging port built into the housing frame of the cord coil. All you need to do to charge your SenCbuds, is using the included USB adapter with your available power source!
How is the sound quality of SenCbuds?
SenCbuds were designed to be more than just intuitive - we also wanted to create earphones that have the most excellent audio quality possible. That’s why we equipped SenCbuds with 9mm drivers, sensitivity to 98DB, an impedance of 16Ω and a frequency range of 5Hz to 25kHz.
Do my SenCbuds have a microphone?
Yes, SenCbuds have a built-in microphone. It allows you to use them as a headset for all your smart devices!
What is the Smart Sense Technology (SST) that powers SenCbuds?The sensor that gives your SenCbuds their unique functionality is a patent-pending, proprietarily designed smart sensor. The sensor is designed to detect the precise moments in which you take your SenCbuds out of your ears, and in which you put them back in, creating a smooth playback experience!",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>One Control Pedal to Rule Them All!</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! If you know me from the Facebook Spark groups, you know I have already been hard at work on my developing an open-source Wireless control footpedal/remote for digital guitar amps, the TinderBox. If not, this is the first pedal compatible with controlling the hot new Spark 40 Amp from Positive Grid, and it works without modification to the amp (just like a universal remote does with your TV). I am very grateful for the overwhelmingly positive response from the Spark community so far. Now, I want to take this project and energy even further!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Do I Need?</h3>
<p>It is no suprise that experimentation and development costs a fair amount of money for parts and equiment. I have done well self-funding so far, but to do even more, I am going to need your help! This will enable me to explore new and innovative ideas around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rotary controls for tone and effects adjustments!</li>
<li>Different screen types and sizes!</li>
<li>Battery power and charging!</li>
<li>3D-Printed enclosures!</li>
<li>Mounting methods for on-guitar use!</li>
<li>Use with other wirelessly controlled amp brands and models!</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Do You Get?</h3>
<p>In exchange for your support, <strong>10 </strong>of you will get a chance to be intrepid navigators of uncharted tonal uses of the Spark before anyone else, and be able to buy an early prototyped version of the pedal for <strong>$75</strong>! You will also be able to help dial in pedal design, responsiveness, and user experience. Additionally, you'll receive personal support for the device from me! Lastly, you will have the choice to keep the Explorer TinderBox Pedal or exchange it towards <strong>40% off</strong> on the finalized pre-built version of the TinderBox Pedal later!</p>
<p>But what if you are not one of the first 10, and you still reaaally like what I'm doing? Pledge <strong>$10</strong> now towards my exploration efforts, and you will get <strong>10% off</strong> the finalized pre-built TinderBox Pedal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The road ahead is not without potential hazards (as any Spark owner knows). I want to address any issues as they arrise, but for the moment, the most pressing concerns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parts shipping amid COVID-19</li>
<li>Legal response from Positive Grid (so far there has been nothing but good vibes from them!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>I have been programming and experimenting with robotics since I was 11, and have spent the last four years working as a professional software developer for two Fortune 500 companies in the financial and video streaming industries. </p>

The thing about audio.Ears are less forgiving than eyes.There are so many situations where the audio quality is easily forgotten in the first place, but hard to ignore afterward. So, whenever we watch or listen to something, we rather have decent audio. Otherwise, it quickly gets annoying. To get there, there a simple thing to regard:the position of the microphone. When you film a video with your smartphone, for instance, the built-in microphone is mostly too far away from the person you actually want to hear in your video. Why? More distance means more ambient and surrounding noise. In other words, you pick up the traffic and other people’s talking and just get this: Instead, with an external microphone, you can record close to the sound source.Short distance means little surrounding noise.In other words, you record only the audio of your interest and just get this:  With Mikme, you record audio at its best. Easily, instantly, wirelessly.From now on, you only capture the best sound – for your business calls, your video memories or your voice recordings.

And we are fathers, friends, and musicians ourselves. So we know there is nothing more important than our kid's rehearsals, our friend's wedding or a new idea for a song. It is those moments we want to capture in the best and easiest possible way.We want to add the sound these moments deserve.We have a professional audio manufacturing background. Half of our team worked for the well-known microphone manufacturer AKG in Vienna, Austria. At AKG we developed, manufactured and designed dozens of professional microphones, wireless microphones, headphones and conferencing system. Since 2016, the team has steadily been growing and now we are a team of 9 persons running Mikme. We've already shipped thousands of Mikmes in more than 100 countries. We are committed to develop Mikme further and to keep the innovation going. We want you to get the best content creation toolkit on the market for the mobile generation.    Behind the ScenesAs we've already launched our first hardware product, the Mikme Gold, to customers around the world, and started production/ramp up back in Autumn 2016. We have already a lot of experience with production and shipping. With some experience and time, we've learned what is important and have already built a solid production line.We manufacture in Germany with the highest attention to detail.As the new product the Mikme Silver is 90% identical with the Mikme Gold we can reuse lots of things such as 90% of the mechanical parts, 95% of the electronics, the same ATE (measurement stuff in the production), production tools and processes which ultimately makes the production ramp up process much smoother and less risky.We have found reliable partners when it comes to shipping.  See the Mikme factory

 

FCC and CE certifications are passed and the development is finished. The Mikme OS software is stable as it is taken over and slightly changed from original Mikme OS.

<h3>Why Crowd Funding?</h3></b><p></p>
<p>We were excited about Squawk'r from the very beginning.  We decided that <b>Indiegogo</b> would be a great way to expand our reach into the market and enable us to get feedback directly from our customers about our little duck .  We value our customers and hope to have a closer relationship with those who's daily lives will be touched by our products. </p><p>Squawk’r will live in a larger family of products under the banner of start-up company XILO, a new electronics lifestyle brand that offers on-the-go, high quality portable power and audio products.  <b>XILO - Extend the Play. </b><br/></p><p>The money raised from this campaign will help us place larger orders with our suppliers to insure a stable supply chain with consistent quality and pricing.  Also, we have some new and exciting product designs waiting in the wings. This will require additional funding to take them into production. With your backing, we can successfully boost XILO to a level that enables us to expand our design, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities. Then we can realize our vision of bringing you more unique power and audio solutions for years to come. </p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Story Behind Squawk'r</span><br/></p><p></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p><p>Squawk'r was inspired by the giant, floating, rubber duck sculptures that Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman set sail in Sydney, Osaka, Hong Kong, Pittsburgh. and recently Los Angeles.  Hofman entertained the world by naming the tour “Spreading Joy Around the World.”  Through Squawk'r we hope to bring a little joy to your world too!  Read about Hofman's rubber ducks here: <a href=""http://goo.gl/xxb75H"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://goo.gl/xxb75H</a></p><p><br/></p><b><h3>Perks &amp; Stretch Goals</h3></b><p>Once we achieve our goals on IndieGoGo and take Squawk’r into the market the intended retail price will be $39.95. For a limited time only, exclusive to our IndieGoGo supporters, we will be offering Squawk’r at several discount levels. There will be two early bird specials rewarding those who contribute first and then ongoing campaign perks that will offer Squawk’r at even larger savings depending on which level you choose to contribute to our campaign. </p><p>Currently we are offering Squawk’r in three colors: Yellow, Camo and Pink. To make things a bit more interesting our two stretch goals will unlock more custom colors for you to choose from! And, each time we break a stretch goal ALL of those who contributed for a Squawk’r, no matter how many units, early bird specials included, will be able to choose any color they like, mix and match any combination they want! Before the campaign closes we will follow up with you shortly after and take your color order.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/796130/files/20140818131028-earliest_duck.png?1408392628"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/796142/files/20140818131201-early_duck.png?1408392721"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/796143/files/20140818131308-mystery_color_1.png?1408392788"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/796147/files/20140818131356-mystery_color_2.png?1408392836"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p>At XILO we are passionate about bringing exciting, new products to market, but we also have a vision of a hunger-free America.  Many of the rubber duckie regattas held across the USA raise money for their local food banks.

</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Is Squawk’r Waterproof? </b> No, it can not be submerged under water. However,  it is water resistant which means you can use it in the shower or on the side of the bathtub or near water. If water is splashed on the silicone body it will not hurt it but if water gets into the speaker holes on the bottom it may damage the Squawk’r</p>
<p><b>How long after the campaign can I expect my Squawk’r to arrive at my door? </b> Our goal is to start shipping the Yellow, Pink &amp; Camo Squawk'r 30 days from the close of the campaign using USPS Priority Mail. Depending on when stretch goals are achieved, the mystery color Squawk'rs could take 45-60 Days from the close of the campaign to begin shipment - We will do our best to keep that time frame as minimal as possible and keep you updated every step of the way. US delivery should be within 2-3 days of shipment and an email will be sent with tracking info. International shipments should be approximately 15 - 20 days from the shipment date and an email will be sent with tracking info.</p>
<p><b>How much of a range does Squawk’r have with my device? </b> Normally 30 feet without any obstructions. If there is a wall or some other obstacle between your device and the Squawk’r then the distance will be less.</p>
<p><b>Is Squawk’r compatible with my Android / iPhone handset? </b> Yes, it will work with most Bluetooth enabled devices including smartphones, tablets and Bluetooth enabled laptops and personal computers. </p>
<p><b>Will Squawk’r play my Pandora, Spotify, Google Play, iTunes music? </b> Yes. If your smartphone, handset, or tablet has Bluetooth capabilities and will connect to another device the music you are playing on your application of choice should play on the Squawk’r.      </p>
<p><b>Does the suction cup have adhesive? Will it leave a residue? </b> There is no adhesive on the suction cup. The suction cup is designed to easily attach to a smooth surface by pushing down until the suction cup is flat. Any “ring” of moisture that is left behind when you remove the Squawk’r can easily be wiped off. Be sure to release the suction by lifting up the edge of the base. Pulling  by the body may separate the suction cup base from the body.</p>
<p><b>What if my Squawk’r stops working? </b> Squawk’r has a 1 year limited warranty for manufacturing defects. Send your defective Squawk’r back within the warranty period to be considered for replacement. Remember, Squawk’r is “water resistant” and NOT “waterproof”. That means if you submerge it in water it will stop working. The warranty does not cover a Squawk’r that has been allowed to be dunked or submerged in water or any other liquid.</p>
<p><b>How much will it cost to ship my Squawk’r? </b> Shipping within the continental USA is free.  INTERNATIONAL Shipping: Please See Each Individual Perk Level and add the appropriate cost to your final perk total before you place your order.</p>
<p><b>I don’t live in the USA. Can you ship a Squawk’r to me? </b> Yes, We offer a flat rate of  $15 for Canada (1-10 units) and $30 for other International (1-10 units) Orders of 11 or more units add an additional $2  each to Canada and $3 each International. </p>

<p><b>ARCHT One is a true omni-directional speaker with a built in sub-woofer</b></p>
<p>With its patented <i>Sound Array</i> technology, the ARCHT One is the only one of its kind.

</div></div>","In the past, speakers have been characterized as directional, large, boxy objects framing a home’s entertainment system and mounted to specific corners of a room. Connected through a twist of wires and controlled with a remote often misplaced or buried between couch cushions, home audio systems of the past proved rigid, cumbersome and crude to the eye. With ARCHT One, we have developed the solution.



ARCHT One transforms audio into something that listeners can seamlessly integrate into their lifestyle and home without compromising quality. Incorporating elegant design with innovative acoustics and simple-to-use features, ARCHT One is the first-of-its-kind wireless 360 speaker that listeners can control from their fingertips.
PATENTED ACOUSTIC INNOVATION: Consistent Multi-Directional Sound Dispersion that Adapts to its Environment
ARCHT One is designed to sound acoustically perfect, regardless of where you put it in the room. ARCHT One’s stunning design architecture incorporates years of acoustic research resulting in the creation of our groundbreaking Sound Array technology, a symbiotic relationship between function and design.





ARCHT One is a true omni-directional speaker with a built in sub-woofer
With its patented Sound Array technology, the ARCHT One is the only one of its kind. It only uses 3 speakers – a full range driver for the mids and highs, a sub-woofer and passive radiator for the bass. Each of these speakers are equipped with a Sound Array module, which transforms the speakers from directional to omnidirectional. The result is consistent, distortion free audio which redefines the meaning of surround sound - it’s truly amazing.



ARCHT One adapts to its surroundings with connectivity options for everyone
At the push of a button, you can control playback of music directly on the ARCHT One wirelessly from your laptop, tablet or mobile device. Choose from connections such as WiFi, AirPlay, DLNA, Bluetooth and direct USB or AUX and stream music straight from the Internet!
WiFi capabilities, in particular, allow you to stream and enjoy your music in high quality formats (24bit/192kHz) – turn the music up and enjoy each song as it was intended to be heard. 


ARCHT One supports Multi- Zone over WiFi



Up to 6 ARCHT One speakers can also be connected over AirPlay, either in the same room or in multiple rooms, giving listeners a complete home audio experience.  

ARCHT One can be connected in True Stereo with Bluetooth Pairing

For those who live by true stereo sound, 2 ARCHT Ones can be paired together in the same room over bluetooth for double the experience!


MODERN LIFESTYLE DESIGN:  A Complete Audio System in a Single Device that Fits Any Space
Use your ARCHT One as you deem fit! Be it as a table centerpiece, at the bar, in the corner of your dining area, by your TV or for your barbeque, ARCHT One works in every scenario.ARCHT One's unique all-in-one design comes fully equipped with full range drivers, a sub-woofer, a passive radiator, amplifier, digital signal processor (DSP), digital analog (DAC) converter, and a plethora of connectivity options, eliminating wire clutter. All this is efficiently assembled into a sleek package guaranteed to turn heads. SIMPLE-TO-USE FEATURES: An Audio System with all the Tech but without the Stress!
With ARCHT One, you can once again hear each beat and lyric the musician intended it as the speaker delivers the quality of live performances straight to your living room. We intentionally crafted ARCHT One to be aesthetically-appealing and produce sound quality that is all-encompassing. ARCHT One will provide a definitive home audio experience with high-resolution sound and modern design for a more immersive and personal audio experience. 








OUR STORY: In Search of the Ultimate Audio Experience







To ensure we were creating an ultimate audio experience, we engaged a diverse group of award winning engineers and designers, who've developed and designed anything from Klipsch speakers to Sennheiser headphones. We wanted to craft a speaker that would look fantastic, sound awesome and be extremely easy for anyone to setup and use.
3 years in the making, we launched our first crowdfunding campaign and raised $242k from 500+ backers in Dec 2014. Not only did we deliver 80% of all units ordered within the first 3 months (Mar 2015). By Jul 2015, all backers received their ARCHT One.
ARCHT One can now be found here on Indiegogo Indemand, on our website and on Amazon. Check out our Amazon reviews to see what our backers think!
By purchasing an ARCHT One, you'll not only be buying a one-of-a-kind audio system, you will also be revolutionizing the audio industry, one speaker at a time. With your support, we develop our next product and take ARCHT into retail, launching in a city near you.

<p>We love the idea of crowdfunding and appreciate both Kickstarter and Indiegogo as great platforms for us to communicate with supporters/users immediately. Backers' opinions always make NEXUM's products better. Our first product AQUA was well-loved by more than 3,400 Kickstarter supporters. As always, backers' suggestions are of great importance for us.</p>
<p>AQUA's delivery was delayed mainly due to Apple certification denials. We're very sorry for the delay. Still, supporters showed understanding, trusted us, and supported our cause. We're now delivering the rewards to all the backers. Once again, thank you very much!</p>
<p>The idea of TuneBox2 actually came earlier than that of AQUA. We've invested in a great deal of time, energy, and resources, just to bring the best product to the world! TuneBox2 presents a new way of listening to music. Many details together make listening to musci more enjoyable.</p>
<p>With our lessons learned with AQUA, we'll monitor the research, manufacturing, and delivery of TuneBox2 more carefully! We guarantee you this time that TuneBox2's delivery will only be early as opposed to delayed. Please support us to help bring it to the world!</p>

<h3>BASSpak: Affordable, Powerful, Wearable Silent Subwoofer</h3>
<p>We are a group of DJs and music lovers who wanted to create a new type of affordable audio technology. With so many expensive packs on the market, we are crowd-sourcing BASSpak to make it the best and most accessible option available for the everyday concert-goer, gamer, movie buff, or music enthusiast. <br/><br/>The BASSpak's silent subwoofer will add a PUNCH to anything you’re listening to. By sending vibrations through your body that match the bass, the BASSpak creates an immersive and individualized bass experience no one else will hear or feel.</p>
<p>Every BASSpak comes equipped with an intuitive plug-and-play control module, so you can just plug in your headphones and JAM! It’s easy to use with your phone, iPod, tablet, laptop, or any other audio device.</p>
<p>The BASSpak has been in development since 2018.  Since then, there have been several prototypes with many important updates and improvements. Each BASSpak is adjustable and fits nearly all body types comfortably. Each BASSpak also has extra storage space big enough for your phone, music player, or wallet. With its sleek, compact, and portable design, you can wear our BASSpak without restricting your ability to dance or move!</p>
<p>Our expert engineers have been focusing on maximizing our components to make the most of every part of our system while saving you money. You’ll feel the bass pounding like in a club or in the pit of a concert. Anywhere you go, connect your BASSpak to a phone or MP3 player for a robust experience, or use the BASSpak to enhance a Silent Disco or your favorite video game or movie.</p>
<p>Everything is ready to do the first production run. We just need YOU! Please consider donating to help make BASSpak available everywhere!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>You Get What You Give<br/> </h3>
<p>We need to raise $5,000.00 to cover the cost of materials and production for a run of 25 BASSpaks.</p>
<p>All the funds raised through this campaign will be used to build the first production run of the BASSpak, regardless of the amount. The more money we raise, the more BASSpaks we will produce for you!</p>
<p>You can even pre-order one of our first 25 BASSpaks by donating $199 or more! Please see our Perks for details.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>More about BASSpak...</h3>
<p>BASSpak brings the quality of other audio packs at an accessible price. We want this audio technology to be available to the masses, not just a select few who can afford a more expensive model. </p>
<p>In addition, if you are deaf or hard-of-hearing, but love to dance, this is an option for you to feel the rhythm wherever you go!</p>
<p>The BASSpak is a great tool for DJs to use while performing or producing music. Clubs and venues can have poor sub-bass monitoring in the DJ booth.  The BASSpak solves this problem and allows DJs to simply and easily monitor sub frequencies, regardless of the venue.<br/><br/>BASSpak technology pairs well with Silent Discos. A Silent Disco is a dance party where each attendee gets a set of headphones tuned to DJs, bands, or other entertainment. The BASSpak team has produced Silent Discos and underground dance parties in Northeastern Pennsylvania since the summer of 2014.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div><h3>Help BASSpak by Sharing!</h3></div><p><br/>If you can't contribute financially, please help by sharing this campaign with your friends, family, and anyone else you can think of to let them know how excited you are for the Basspak!

By sending vibrations through your body that match the bass, the BASSpak creates an immersive and individualized bass experience no one else will hear or feel.
Every BASSpak comes equipped with an intuitive plug-and-play control module, so you can just plug in your headphones and JAM! It’s easy to use with your phone, iPod, tablet, laptop, or any other audio device.
The BASSpak has been in development since 2018.  Since then, there have been several prototypes with many important updates and improvements. Each BASSpak is adjustable and fits nearly all body types comfortably. Each BASSpak also has extra storage space big enough for your phone, music player, or wallet. With its sleek, compact, and portable design, you can wear our BASSpak without restricting your ability to dance or move!
Our expert engineers have been focusing on maximizing our components to make the most of every part of our system while saving you money. You’ll feel the bass pounding like in a club or in the pit of a concert. Anywhere you go, connect your BASSpak to a phone or MP3 player for a robust experience, or use the BASSpak to enhance a Silent Disco or your favorite video game or movie.
Everything is ready to do the first production run. We just need YOU! Please consider donating to help make BASSpak available everywhere!
 

You Get What You Give 
We need to raise $5,000.00 to cover the cost of materials and production for a run of 25 BASSpaks.
All the funds raised through this campaign will be used to build the first production run of the BASSpak, regardless of the amount. The more money we raise, the more BASSpaks we will produce for you!
You can even pre-order one of our first 25 BASSpaks by donating $199 or more! Please see our Perks for details.

 
More about BASSpak...
BASSpak brings the quality of other audio packs at an accessible price. We want this audio technology to be available to the masses, not just a select few who can afford a more expensive model. 
In addition, if you are deaf or hard-of-hearing, but love to dance, this is an option for you to feel the rhythm wherever you go!
The BASSpak is a great tool for DJs to use while performing or producing music. Clubs and venues can have poor sub-bass monitoring in the DJ booth.  The BASSpak solves this problem and allows DJs to simply and easily monitor sub frequencies, regardless of the venue.BASSpak technology pairs well with Silent Discos. A Silent Disco is a dance party where each attendee gets a set of headphones tuned to DJs, bands, or other entertainment. The BASSpak team has produced Silent Discos and underground dance parties in Northeastern Pennsylvania since the summer of 2014.

<p>The Fireside Audiobox is more than dancing flames. Any object you place in your home should speak to you, and those you invite inside. My goal with the aesthetics of the audiobox was to ensure that it was a beautiful addition to your home as well as a conversation starter. It needs to look elegant and intriguing, while still looking like it belongs where you place it, even when not in use. It is a functional piece of art.</p>
<p>I use one of my prototypes as my everyday music player. In the evening, I fire it up and settle into a meditative-like state after a long day. A craft beer is a nice addition, too.</p>

<p>The idea for the Fireside Audiobox was born in 2013 while I was working in a maker-space in San Diego. Trying to educate myself in prototyping and fabrication, I needed a project that required the use of all areas and most machines in the shop. With a physics background and an interest in fire, I got to work. The response to my prototype was overwhelming; people loved it. </p>
<p>Hoping to eventually produce these at scale, I started diving into the design, functionality and user experience in great detail. After three years of refinements, I'm incredibly happy with the final results.</p>
<p>In opposition to more standard go-to-market strategies, I thought it would be more fun to bring the Fireside Audiobox directly to the people via crowdfunding. Due to its visual nature, the on-trend styling and the current popularity of unique, bespoke functional design pieces, I thought this was the most direct route to my audience. After a successful Kickstarter campaign in July/August 2016, we're now parking this project here for extended direct sales and promotion. Selling directly also allows me to offer a considerably lower price and gives me a personal connection to my backers (and vice versa). So, here we are, on Indiegogo!</p>

After a successful Kickstarter campaign in July/August 2016, we're now parking this project here for extended direct sales and promotion. Selling directly also allows me to offer a considerably lower price and gives me a personal connection to my backers (and vice versa). So, here we are, on Indiegogo!
 

• Dimensions: The lightweight, self-contained audio system stands 19.5 inches high, 14 inches wide and 4.5 inches deep.
• Bluetooth-Enabled: With its built-in Bluetooth technology, users are able pair the Fireside Audiobox with any Bluetooth-enabled device for easy music streaming.
• Battery-Powered: The onboard Li-po battery provides more than 8 hours of constant music on a single charge (power adapter).
• Propane Duration: The 16.4 oz canister typically lasts about 8 hours depending on pressure, environmental variables and the intensity of your music.

Science! I mapped the audio waves within the aluminum tube and identified the spots along its length that would produce the most responsive and dramatic flame effects.
Sound waves mapped within the aluminum tube. 



You’ll get the Fireside Audiobox audio player base, the glass shield, a power charger for the internal battery, and instructions for very simple set-up and maintenance. The only thing I can’t send you in the mail is the propane canister (like what you’d use on a camping stove), so you’ll need to grab one of those at your local hardware or camping store. Usually just 3-4 bucks each.
 

Production is under way! This chart shows our medium-term production and assembly plans for our original campaign. Based on ongoing interest and sales, these development windows will adjust - as of right now, we're looking at faster timelines, which is great. Please get in touch with questions regarding the arrival time of your Fireside Audiobox.

 

You can now upgrade to BLACK or GUNMETAL GRAY anodized aluminum components! We're really excited about this one. ALL backers get this customization option for FREE! ALL CAPS BECAUSE IT'S AWESOME! We're also proud to offer a graphic customization option for those of you who'd like to dress up a custom Audiobox with your company's logo or a personal graphic. And of course we also have the Natural vs Dark finishes (already your choice upon fulfilment). Thanks for your support!

Thanks for checking out the Fireside Audiobox - I know you’re going to love it. I deeply appreciate your help as I work to surpass my goal, and any pledge amount brings us one step closer to success. Help me produce and deliver this product and there will be many more interactive, hand-made art pieces to follow!

Don't hesitate to give us your suggestions in the comments ! The EOZ Air provides a top-shelf sound experience characterised by powerful bass, and super clear and crispy mid-highs.The custom made 8mm electro-dynamic drivers deliver a fine tuned High Resolution Audio for a natural sound signature. Combined with the latest aptX® technology, that significantly reduces the bit rate without affecting audio quality, you get a pure wireless CD-like quality sound.Some brands decide to implement heart rate and fitness trackers, we don't ! We chose to emphasise on the sound quality and used the extra space to host two 8mm large custom made dynamic drivers. Yes, sound should always come first.Our team of engineers and audio professionals spent countless hours refining the sound signature of the EOZ Air to make sure that you get an audio experience on par with the best wired earphones on the market. The EOZ Air provides up to 4 hours of listening time on a single charge. The charging case gives you an additional 48 hours of listening time while on the go. The beat just goes on !  We made sure that the EOZ Air will securely stay in place in your ears in every situation. Either you Run, Dance, Workout or even take a nap, you’ll forget that you are wearing earphones !Every person has a different ear canal size and shape. To ensure a comfortable fit for everyone, the EOZ Air comes with 6 different set of ear tips:
3 size of Memory Foam ear tips (S - M - L)
3 size of Silicone ear tips (S - M - L)
Thanks to an over the ear hook engineered to gently adapt to all ears, the EOZ Air offers an extra-secure fit with zero discomfort. No more falling down your ear ! 
The EOZ Air will quickly become your favorite fitness partner. No wires will ever get in your way when working out. Sweat resistant means that you won't have to worry for if you decide to go the extra mile !

 It has never been so easy to pair your earphones with all your favorite devices. Remove the EOZ Air from its charging case and it will automatically start pairing with the last device you used. CONNECT WITH ALL YOUR DEVICES The EOZ Air is compatible with all your devices that use the Bluetooth Technology:

One-time bluetooth pairing with your smartphone or laptop sets you up to savor your music, podcasts or TV shows without interruptions.
 
 Astonishing Graphene-Enhanced AudioAlien audio drivers are coated with graphene acoustic membranes. Graphene is a thin yet sturdy material with excellent conductivity, that allows sound waves to oscillate at their precise frequency, no matter what kind of music you're listening to. The result: bass with low distortions, while mid and high tones are carried cleanly. Other earbuds use bulky and low-cost conductors such as silicon, which result in audio quality loss. That's why Alien sounds better than the other wireless earbuds that don't use graphene. Graphene also conducts electricity better than Silicon, allowing it to elongate battery life.Typically, graphene-enhanced audio products are sold at premium prices, yet we’re able to keep the costs low because we own and manage our supply chain.  All Day PlaytimeThe sleek charging spaceship uses a powerful micro-lithium ion battery that can keep your earbuds charged for up to 30 hours. Earbuds can play music for 4.5 hours on a full charge. Tight Seal Blocks Out NoisesWhen you put Alien earbuds in, you'll give it a slight twist to seal it perfectly into your ear canal. With this tight seal, you can block out ambient background noises and prevent sound leaks during calls. Comfortable Fit, Stays in Your EarAlien earbuds comes with three tip sizes so they fit comfortably into any sized ear canal. When you're active, whether you're commuting to work or jogging, you won't need to worry about these earbuds falling out.Each Alien earbud comes with three interchangeable eartip sizes. Workout, No SweatOur sweat-proof design prevents external moisture from affecting audio quality. Dust-proof encasing prevents dirt particles from building up and seeping into the equipment. Clear Calls Anywhere
Vertically-oriented mic picks up your voice only, so you can take important calls with clear audio. Take calls while on a crowded bus, outside at a coffee shop, or even on the streets while jogging.  Control Without a PhoneOnce paired to your phone, you can skip songs and answer calls without needing to look at your phone. Use the single button to control your music and calls:

With the Ayra, you can stream music wirelessly anywhere via bluetooth (Or wired with the included 3.5mm adapter). Experience a deeper and more resonant sound than you ever thought possible from such a small device.


Heres to the Little Guy
We designed the Ayra to be as beautiful as it is powerful. With only 3 buttons (Play, Next & Back) it just seems to work; Ayra is the pocket-sized speaker that will leave a room of guests wondering where the music is coming from! Its the home theatre in your pocket. The share anything anywhere speaker.
It Just Werks...Ayra is compatible with any device that has bluetooth functionality. Pair it with your mac or PC to watch movies or play music wirelessly, Apple and Android, even Palms and gaming devices work too. Simplify your Sound!
Steve Jobs put 1,000 Songs in your Pocket. We're Giving you an Entire Concert

Up to 7 Hours of Battery Life
It won't call it a day until you do
Built with the end-user in mind, Ayra has been constructed with a lithium-ion battery that will provide it up to 7 hours of continuous playback. That’s enough music to last from your morning coffee until dinner time.
Bluetooth Made Easy
Speakerphone? More like Megaphone.
Ayra is made to Simplify your Sound... NOT to make you spend 20 min trying to get your devices to pair. We created the Ayra with HeadCase Sound's EasyPair system so that it goes into pairing mode the moment it's turned on.",11.0,1,"2 Campaigns

-PAVILION WIRELESS SPEAKER-



PAVILION PROTOTYPE SOUND TEST


<Audio was recorded from 0.5m distance>Pavilion is a high-performance wireless speaker with an innovative modern design. We scrambled different materials with an existing speaker structure to redefine it to a beautiful piece of art. Pavilion sets a new paradigm in a speaker design, delivering amazing performance and fascinating experience.

DESIGNING PAVILIONWe tried to disconnect ourselves from old clichés and make an original approach from different perspectives. Our team looked through some of the greatest modern architectures designed by Mies van der Rohe, Ando Tadao, and Frank Lloyd Wright. We studied how these architectures were constructed with modern materials and designs.
In the process of designing the speaker, we were captivated by the attractive curves and a glossy finish of brass instruments. We studied the instrument's curvature and integrated it to our spiral copper port design. The spiral inside the clear wall is breathtaking and makes it attractive from 360 degrees.

Speaker base is made with a high-density concrete used in modern architectures. The base firmly holds the speaker in place preventing acoustic loss from any vibration. The elegant surface finish goes smoothly with the surrounding flow. 

The varnished oak top of the speaker is handcrafted with the finest oaks from North America. Subtle waves of the grain and the deep color translate to state of tranquility. Oak surface senses user’s touch for the speaker control. The touch is pleasing even during the short seconds of control.

PAVILION SOUND SYSTEM 


 D-SPIRAL ACOUSTIC

<Sound Velocity Simulation>Spiral copper pipe inside the clear case is not just for the design. The pipe boosts the bass frequencies by the principles of acoustic resonance. We shaped it like no other to give Pavilion its unique look while improving the performance. 


WIRELESS CONNECTION & STEREO MUSIC

Playing music and pairing two Pavilions is simple. Pavilion is compatible with iPhone, Android, and any other devices with the Bluetooth function.


DYNAMIC FULL RANGE SPEAKER 


<Prototype Frequency Response Graph>
We are using high quality 20W Peerless transducer for the best acoustic quality. We designed the cabinet to make the frequency response as flat as possible replicating unbiased sound. Boomy bass, bright treble might temporarily spice up the sound, but ears get tired after long listening with these alteration.
FUNCTION DEMONSTRATION


 <The design of working sample is different from the final version of Pavilion>TOUCH CONTROLCapacitive touch control is on top of the speaker. Simply touch the oak surface to pair a device, play/pause music, and adjust a volume. LED Indicator on the top shows you the current status of Pavilion.POWER AND PORTThree rounds are behind the back. A power button to turn-on the Pavilion; Aux port for hooking up MP3 players, classic CD players, and other wired devices; AC adapter port for charging.
-PAVILION Q LIMITED-Pavilion Q is the high-end version of Pavilion. The additional finish in the design takes the uniqueness of Pavilion a step further. 
There is a copper accent around the waist and the top control buttons. Its glossiness and light reflection makes the speaker luxurious. All these parts are hand carved and polished with precision. The quantity is limited because It takes much more time to build each parts.
Pavilion Q uses same technical parts that are used by Pavilion. It uses 20W Full-Range Peereless Transducer, D-Spiral Acoustic, Bluetooth Connection, Wireless Stereo Pairing, Rechargeable Battery, Touch Control on American White Oak and Aux Port.
Pavilion Q is another piece of architecture inside your home and the design is simple yet sophisticated. Innovative engineering makes the speaker even more beautiful.

<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With its revolutionary technology, aiFi® introduces a new way of listening to music. Thanks to its smart stackability, you can stack virtually any number of aiFi speakers together and they will transform into one larger speaker with pristine sound – without cables or any cumbersome settings. No matter how many units you stack, you will immidiately notice the difference in sound quality and loudness. </b></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The aiFi speaker is rough and tough to go with you on the road but still looks good in your living room with its award winning design. Build your own Wall of Sound, alone or together with others.</b></p>

<p> </p>
<p>aiFi®, Artificial Intelligence Fidelity, is the first truly intelligent modular sound system. Stack the units together and build in any configuration you can imagine – with no given limitation. </p>
<p>Using their intelligence, the units calculate and decide how to best shape the total sound for you. One single unit is enough to fill your room with excellent sound that gets even better the more you stack.</p>
<p>As aiFi offers true modularity and scalable sound, the product does the job all the way from the bedside table to the party . It also works perfectly as a speaker for your multi-room solution. Three stacked units easily make a soundbar for your TV using the digital optical input. And a six-stack is way enough for a party in your patio.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>The aiFi Sound</h2>
<p>Each unit is tuned to handle the deepest bass possible, with balanced and smooth mid- and high-frequency performance. One aiFi can definitely deliver firm punchy bass that is beyond what you would think was physically possible, but when you stack multiple units together – that is when the magic begins.</p>
<p>The surface of the speakers collectively adds up and pushes the actual bass performance deeper and deeper the larger stack you make. Stack them either sideways or on top of each other, and the result will give you not only louder sound – the overall sound quality also gets much better.</p>

<p>Being involved in a great number of product developments over the years, the idea of modularity has always intrigued Fredrik Gunnarsson, the Sound Wizard behind aiFi. Several of his modular product concepts have been implemented in various products over the years.</p>
<p>After working in Asia for some time, the idea of aiFi matured. When moving back to Karlstad in Värmland, Sweden, it was natural to team up with Victor Isaksen.

With its revolutionary technology, aiFi® introduces a new way of listening to music. Thanks to its smart stackability, you can stack virtually any number of aiFi speakers together and they will transform into one larger speaker with pristine sound – without cables or any cumbersome settings. No matter how many units you stack, you will immidiately notice the difference in sound quality and loudness. 
The aiFi speaker is rough and tough to go with you on the road but still looks good in your living room with its award winning design. Build your own Wall of Sound, alone or together with others.
Available at www.aifi.se
 


 
aiFi®, Artificial Intelligence Fidelity, is the first truly intelligent modular sound system. Stack the units together and build in any configuration you can imagine – with no given limitation. 
Using their intelligence, the units calculate and decide how to best shape the total sound for you. One single unit is enough to fill your room with excellent sound that gets even better the more you stack.
As aiFi offers true modularity and scalable sound, the product does the job all the way from the bedside table to the party . It also works perfectly as a speaker for your multi-room solution. Three stacked units easily make a soundbar for your TV using the digital optical input. And a six-stack is way enough for a party in your patio.
 

The aiFi Sound
Each unit is tuned to handle the deepest bass possible, with balanced and smooth mid- and high-frequency performance. One aiFi can definitely deliver firm punchy bass that is beyond what you would think was physically possible, but when you stack multiple units together – that is when the magic begins.
The surface of the speakers collectively adds up and pushes the actual bass performance deeper and deeper the larger stack you make. Stack them either sideways or on top of each other, and the result will give you not only louder sound – the overall sound quality also gets much better.
 
""There are no cables, no settings, just stack them and experience the magic""
 
 

 
Intelligent Stackability


The shape of each aiFi unit makes it easy to stack. Already 20 units make a full circle that is approximately 1.2 meters in diameter. This curved shape of each unit makes it easy to build a stable stack of a great number of units. On the top of the unit there are two grooves that make the rubber feet on the bottom fit securely. On each side of the unit is the placeholder for our aiFi Coin. This coin is what enables the units to hook together sidewise with its unique magnetic system.

The aiFi App
We provide the aiFi App that acts as a remote control of your stack and can make all the settings that you can do on the touch pannel on the back of the speaker by using your smart phone. It also provides additional features. One of these features are the mood light function of your stack – it can be set to any color.
At a click of a button the app enables you to instantly share the playback with your friends. Stack your aiFis together without any hustle sharing cables or messing around with Bluetooth pairing. This is really a social way of enjoying sound.

 
The Technology Behind
The modular sound system communicates using near field IR technology to transfer sound and the needed communication wirelessly between the aiFis at the speed of light. This ensures that the signal is distributed between the units without any losses and with high data integrity.
 
Pristine Sound
The approach of using many small speakers together makes the total performance raptor fast following every nuance of the music you are listening to or movie you are watching. This is quality you only find in true high-grade speaker systems like electrostatic loudspeakers. The aiFi Sound Dimension™ technology ensures perfect balance of the tonal, dynamic and spatial dimensions of sound. This gives you an incredible room-filling experience.
 

 
""The Dimensions of Sound Reproduced by Sound Dimension™ Technology""
 
High Performance
With our professional background we surely do not go cheap on the analog line in function. There is a high-grade input stage that can handle any source with ease. Using that together with top-of-the-line ADC converters and a 192kHz/24bit digital sound processor, nothing gets in the way of the performance you are enjoying.
The input is also an optical SPDIF input that accepts PCM signals up to 96kHz/24bit. This is primarily to enable TVs that do not have any other sound output. But it also enables the aiFi speaker to double as a high-grade DAC to optimize the performance of your desktop sound. 
 

User Interface

To the right on the back, there are three touch sense control areas. From top down there is the power button that takes the unit into operational mode when pushed for 3 seconds. Next is the middle button that puts the speaker in BT pairing mode when you want to pair with a new phone. At the bottom is the line/BT select function. Sliding your finger from bottom to top increases volume, sliding from top to bottom decreases volume.

The aiFi Story
Being involved in a great number of product developments over the years, the idea of modularity has always intrigued Fredrik Gunnarsson, the Sound Wizard behind aiFi. Several of his modular product concepts have been implemented in various products over the years.
After working in Asia for some time, the idea of aiFi matured. When moving back to Karlstad in Värmland, Sweden, it was natural to team up with Victor Isaksen. Victor has a great network all over the world in general and in Värmland in particular, which strengthened the team dramatically, making it possible to manage and carry out product development in Värmland.
It was Victor’s and Fredrik’s combined strengths that made them form a brand around this intelligent product concept. 
“Victor called me just minutes after we parted from the meeting where we decided to move on with a brand. Enthusiastically he suggested the brand name aiFi, and I just immediately felt, ‘This is it!’” says Fredrik.

<td>The Bravo Headphones were developed utilizing hybrid electrostatic technology created by VeriSonix Corp. Electrostatic headphones are universally accepted as the best in the business, with only the most hardcore professionals using them - DJs, recording studios, and film executives. VeriSonix created a solution that removes the bulk of the amplifier while still preserving the quality of the sound. The team at VeriSonix tested various materials, resulting in the current version of the hybrid electrostatic technology. Working with VeriSonix, Sharkk has created a hybrid electrostatic headphone that produces beautiful sound in a sophisticated design.</td>

</div></div>","All day, every day, we are bombarded by sound. Some sounds are desirable, but many are not because sound has no discretion. If it isn't what or who you want to hear, it is just noise - purely a distraction. Imagine if you could just focus on that slice of sound that you want to hear. With Stages, your ability to focus on what you want to hear, rather than fending off what you don't, just got a whole lot easier.  Both the Hero and Sidekick contain Stages' patented technology to narrowly identify and capture desired incoming voices and sounds based on user preferences, virtually eliminating undesired ones in the process. Both products make it possible to keep your headphones/earbuds on while listening and talking. No more lip reading and no more removing devices. Meant for mobile lifestyles, the Hero offers superior noise cancellation with wired or wireless capability. Audiophile-level sound quality with onboard low EMI Class H stereo amplifiers and integrated dual ultra-low power audio codecs. When combined with our audio array’s ambient+ and selective sound technology, it’s the last headphone you’ll need. The Sidekick offers the same premium quality audio technology as the Hero and is meant for tabletop usage. It’s compatible with nearly all wired or wireless headphones/earbuds. Rechargeable and portable, the Sidekick is your ultimate office, coffee shop, and home companion.     ​  ​   ​        ​                              The center of our Audio Processing System is the Stages microphone array, which is responsible for processing all incoming sound. The array in both the Hero and Sidekick enhances your listening experience through selective sound admittance gating (when you hear) and ambient+ audio spatialization (the direction you choose to hear from). Our technology makes it possible to keep your headphones on while listening & talking. No more lip reading and no more removing headphones/earbuds. Simply put, the Hero and Sidekick integrate with your lifestyle to remove isolation from immersive experiences. From the moment we wake up, we’re faced with noise that impacts our ability to focus on what’s important at home, work - everywhere you go. Selective sound gives you the ability to specify precise admittance criteria (such as a keyword or specific speaker profile) that will allow incoming ambient sound in when these user-specified criteria are met. With selective sound, for the first time ever, you have the ability to control your soundscape to the fullest extent. Provides users with the ability to specify the direction from which they want to hear ambient sound.

The end result? We are able to track ambient sound at a full 360 degrees so you can customize direction and admittance criteria all while listening to your favorite music. Featuring hybrid noise cancellation technology, four microphones capture unwanted noise and then produce an inverted phase of identical sound to cancel both of them out. The Hero's circumaural design, when combined with our noise cancellation processor, blocks 99.5% of ambient noise for a quiet listening experience at home, work, school, airport - wherever you go.

The WSA-1, features Amazon Alexa, while the WS-A1G is optimized for Google Assistant. These new headsets employ your mobile device's web connection, enabling continuous, hands free access to these cloud-based virtual-assistants. Whether home, or on the go, your assistant is always available.The headset is equipped with three separate microphones that feature Kenwood's proprietary voice algorithm detection. This feature increases the device’s ability to accurately transmit the user’s normal speaking voice, even in noisy environments. This eliminates user stress by allowing the user the ability to simply communicate normally and still be easily identified by both the virtual assistant and callers. The headsets incorporate a touch sensitive side panel that controls volume, tracking, and features like active noise canceling, which eliminates ambient noise, to better experience music, videos, and calls.Wearing a smart headset device all day, requires comfort, so the design of the earpiece was really important to our Kenwood creation team when designing the shape of the WSA1 earpiece. The soft ""ear pillow"" structure is uniquely shaped to promote comfort, but more importantly to provide a gentle, natural feeling surface connection with the user's ear. The double layered silicone structure provides the perfect balance of softness, but still firm enough to provide both stability, and long time wearing comfort.WS-A1 makes this idea reality. This new smart headset makes having an anytime, anywhere, voice activated assistant possible while delivering these high tech features..*The high performance microphone filters ambient noise through Kenwood's active cancelling technology, delivering crystal clear voice transmission for the user.* This comfortable, ergonomic design promotes extended use and eliminates common ear fatigue users’ experience with other headsets.* The ""Voice Focus Assist"" function promotes the virtual assistant's ability to clearly identify the user's voice. This allows your assistant increased focus and a clearer understanding of user commands in noisy environments.In my daily life, my headphones, and smartphone are always with me. I enjoy having instant access to the latest news and weather. I use my device to message friends and family, manage calls, and schedule appointments. I record notes,and reminders throughout my day, and I always have my favorite music playing in the background. My handheld device has become an important part of almost everything I do. What could be better? I began to think how nice it would be to have my very own personal assistant, to do  these things for me, without ever having to reach for my handheld device! A virtual assistant that's accessible at home or away that would speak to me, help me on the go.The Kenwood WSA1 smart headset allows complete hands free access to your mobile device, through use of a virtual assistant, without ever having to physically access your smart phone.

<p>We offer free international shipping, but EU customers please note there is a “shipping charge” added. This is because we are a Danish company and are required to charge VAT by the EU VAT system. But as VAT will also be applied on the final EU retail price (resulting in a higher price level), EU customers are still getting the discount listed in the Rewards - the same discount for all backers worldwide.</p>
<p>Duty/VAT charges: Our headphones will be shipped from Denmark, so please note that you will be responsible for any applicable duty/VAT charges. Unfortunately we can't display all possible Duty/VAT terms for international shipping, so we recommend you check with your local customs to learn more about the procedure in your country. And we will of course try to help as much as we can.</p>

Frederik Jorgensen, Co-Founder, AIAIAI: “The Modular system creates the ultimate flexibility for our business and our customers as well as a more creative way of interacting with our products. This adaptable, versatile approach to our headphones offers radical new opportunities for future product development, enabling us to expand the system to create better options for our users.""

 AIAIAI is a Danish audio design company based in Copenhagen. We are dedicated to developing high quality audio products for our users, and we’re proud to contribute to Denmark’s worldwide reputation as a leader in acoustic and electro-acoustic design and engineering.
We have an expansive network of audio technicians and DJs as part of our unique and highly collaborative development process, but most importantly, we work closely with Danish design studio Kilo. Founded and headed by Lars Larsen, Kilo is an award-winning, idea-driven industrial design studio positioned among Scandinavia’s most influential design companies. Kilo has been our design partner since 2006, when we founded our companies in neighboring offices.
We might not share an office any more, but we still build upon a set of shared values, aesthetics and design thinking, making our ongoing relationship very intuitive. We know how to work together; the expertise of both entities, our joint and thorough ideation processes and our well-tested manufacturing know-how make us confident in our collaborations and their arrival at a great outcome     

 

 

 
 

We offer free international shipping, but EU customers please note there is a “shipping charge” added. This is because we are a Danish company and are required to charge VAT by the EU VAT system. But as VAT will also be applied on the final EU retail price (resulting in a higher price level), EU customers are still getting the discount listed in the Rewards - the same discount for all backers worldwide.
Duty/VAT charges: Our headphones will be shipped from Denmark, so please note that you will be responsible for any applicable duty/VAT charges. Unfortunately we can't display all possible Duty/VAT terms for international shipping, so we recommend you check with your local customs to learn more about the procedure in your country. And we will of course try to help as much as we can.",17.0,1,"1 Campaign

which is a basic microphone for cameras, camcorders, and smartphones, and is useful for recording conversations in the front of camera In such a shooting situation, seeing an photographer installing

<p>Shortly after pledging you’ll be prompted to choose the color scheme for your SOUNDSHIELD. We’d love to offer our backers every color scheme we have tried out, sadly the cost for that is too high, so we must start small. These are the options available for now.  We will add new ones as we move forward.</p>

<p>Please contact <strong>support@unit1gear.com</strong> with any questions or requests.</p> <p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Can I use the helmet without the headphones?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Sure you can. You even have a set of ear pads to cover the holes on the side in case you get chilly. Or you can leave them uncovered too, if you want.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Are SOUNDSHIELD Headphones On-Ear of Over-Ear?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Our headphones are On-Ear but they’re pretty big and will cover your ear entirely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What colors are available?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Right now we are starting out with 3 color schemes (Original, Snow Patrol and Boreal). But we will add more  as we move forward! So stay tuned!</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Can I change my color scheme once I made my order?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Once a perk is claimed and the payment done, the order is final. Please take the time to choose your color scheme well!</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the helmet sizes?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> SOUNDSHIELD comes in 3 sizes: XS-S, M-L, and XL-XXL. But on top of that you’ll have 2 sets of inner pads for the helmet. It includes 5 individual pads you can customize to achieve a perfect fit. Please use our sizing chart to determine your size correctly.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the customizable fit work?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Each SOUNDSHIELD has 5 inner pads. But it comes with an extra set of thicker pads. You can create your own custom fit by mixing pads from both sets. For reference, an M-L Size with thin pads would be closer to a L, but with thick pads, closer to a M.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I wear a beanie and goggles under the helmet?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Totally, just remove the pads so you don’t add unnecessary bulkiness and you’re all set.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I am a journalist, who do I contact for more information?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Please contact bck@dynamopr.com</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is SOUNDSHIELD safe?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yeah it is. We designed it comply with ASTM 2040, EN1077 and EN 1078. It has a 3 mm thick ABS shell and a 15-35 mm thick EPP Liner..that’s a lot of protection, we got you covered.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How does music affect safety?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Action sports and music play well together. There's nothing like the right tune to shred some powder or hit the park. Most helmets today are audio kit compatible, but none of them have an interface that will let you pause or lower the volume as easily and as quickly. This means you'll be more accessible and less isolated. People that ride without helmets because they can't fit their everyday headphones in there, well, now they can. So we are for safety, not against :)  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is SOUNDSHIELD Waterproof?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The headphones are designed to be IP-X4 sweat proof. They can take sweat and snow without problem. Just don’t use them under heavy rain..(and don’t take them for a swim)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Are the Headphones tough?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We built them to last. They can take on your active lifestyle without problem.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong>Does this meet helmet safety in Australia</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We aim for the 3 major certifications worldwide. We won’t however, have Australian specific certifications.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Technical</strong></p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How is the sound quality?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Pretty great. The headphones have 40mm drivers backed up with hand picked electrical components  to ensure optimal sound delivery.</p> <p><strong>Shipping</strong></p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I live outside of the US, what are my shipping costs?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Once you claim your perk, you will be prompted to choose your country for shipping.</p>
<p>Unless the perk says free shipping, each country will have a shipping cost. Choose yours.</p>

<div><h3> </h3></div>
</div></div>","Audio kits only work while you are wearing your helmet..so they are useless when the helmet comes off.
Dealing with a fiddly interface (or no interface at all) to control your music is awful.
You can't wear your everyday headphones with your helmet and that`s even worse.


 

Simply dock the headphones into the helmet when you need protection, and click them out when you just want audio. 
 
LOCK
Docking the headphones: Our patented docking system secures the headphones inside the helmet using four anchor points. They’re not going anywhere while you are shredding.

And when you are done, a quick release tab will detach the headphones.
 
PAIR
One button pairing: Hold down the button and it’s done! No apps, no wires, no hassle.

CONTROL
Specially Designed Interface: This is a big deal since you obviously can’t look at the headphones while using them, and if you’re on the mountain, gloves make buttons a nightmare.

SOUNDSHIELD has you covered - even with your thickest mittens, our single button control and volume dial make music mastery a breeze.

Rotate the dial to change volume, crank it up or take down with ease.

Take calls with a tap of the button, no need to take your phone out. A built in mic will do the rest for you.

One tap of the button pauses your music so you can talk to your friends. Be it the chairlift or just a quiet moment, pausing is quick and easy.

With waterproof headphones rated IPX-4  you can con chest deep in pow without a worry in the world

Detachable headphones mean you don’t leave your music  behind when you take off your helmet.



 



 


 

Shortly after pledging you’ll be prompted to choose the color scheme for your SOUNDSHIELD. We’d love to offer our backers every color scheme we have tried out, sadly the cost for that is too high, so we must start small. These are the options available for now.  We will add new ones as we move forward.

 


 

 

 

 

 

We went ALL IN with sound quality: 40 mm speakers backed up with hand picked electrical components to deliver uncompromised quality. You’ll get crisp highs and deep lows. Wirelessly. For  16 hours straight between charges.



The SOUNDSHIELD Helmet was designed to comply with the 3 major Safety Certifications:  ASTM 2040, EN1077 and EN 1078. That makes it legally usable for snow and action sports in USA, Canada and Europe. We will go through certification once we have the first full scale manufacturing sample. 



The SOUNDSHIELD Helmet has a built in ventilation system with 2 low profile air inlets and 6 outlets.  Cool air is pushed in as you move forward, keeping your head cool.



As a fully rider owned and operated startup, we are a combination of people devoted to creating awesome products for awesome lifestyles. We got together as a team 18 months ago to apply our design background to our riding experience and create an unusual blend of innovative products: The SOUNDSHIELD is the first one.
THIS IS US:  Juan Garcia Mansilla - Founder / CEO

Juan is an Industrial Designer and Entrepreneur. When he’s not on the slopes he is designing innovative real-world products for work and crazy concepts for fun. Up here we see him hauling filming equipment up top for the Campaign video shoot. Yep, that is real sweat right there.
 
Javier Bertani - Co-founder / CTO

Javier is an Industrial Designer with more than 15 years of experience in the field of Product Design and an avid Skater as well. He has extensive experience in bringing products to market. There he is, soaking up some California sun.
 
Francisco Abelleira - Director of Operations /  COO

Francisco’s  keen eye for business and passion for building brands has ultimately led him into UNIT 1, where he is responsible for everything that transpires on the business side of things.  He has an International Business degree and an MBA in from IAE + London Business School. He has run a company-wide Product Launch Division at GSK for the past five years. So don’t be fooled for that photo chilling on the beach..this guy means business.

For over 18 months the team worked hard on SOUNDSHIELD, building an awesome experience from the ground up. Here's what we've been up to this far (and what's ahead):  

We created SOUNDSHIELD from scratch. All we started with was an experience begging to be improved. We ended up redifining it completely. After countless sketches, 3D prints, product iterations and prototypes, SOUNDSHIELD is finally here.
These images depict the ‘behind the scenes’ aspect of this process:


We've come a long way with SOUNDSHIELD. We have the necessary expertise in product design & manufacturing to make it happen.
And that's where you come in:  we need your help to move forward and make the jump to mass production.
We are aware there will be risks and challenges along the way. But we are confident our amazing  team will overcome them to ensure our backers get their SOUNDSHIELD. We will keep you guys updated every step of the way, once you back this project you become a part of this family. This truly means a lot to us. So buckle up, this is happening!

Please contact support@unit1gear.com with any questions or requests. General
Q: Can I use the helmet without the headphones?
A: Sure you can. You even have a set of ear pads to cover the holes on the side in case you get chilly. Or you can leave them uncovered too, if you want.
 
Q: Are SOUNDSHIELD Headphones On-Ear of Over-Ear?A: Our headphones are On-Ear but they’re pretty big and will cover your ear entirely.
 
Q: What colors are available?
A: Right now we are starting out with 3 color schemes (Original, Snow Patrol and Boreal). But we will add more  as we move forward! So stay tuned! Q: Can I change my color scheme once I made my order?
A: Once a perk is claimed and the payment done, the order is final. Please take the time to choose your color scheme well! Q: What are the helmet sizes?
A: SOUNDSHIELD comes in 3 sizes: XS-S, M-L, and XL-XXL. But on top of that you’ll have 2 sets of inner pads for the helmet. It includes 5 individual pads you can customize to achieve a perfect fit. Please use our sizing chart to determine your size correctly. Q: How does the customizable fit work?
A: Each SOUNDSHIELD has 5 inner pads. But it comes with an extra set of thicker pads. You can create your own custom fit by mixing pads from both sets. For reference, an M-L Size with thin pads would be closer to a L, but with thick pads, closer to a M. Q: Can I wear a beanie and goggles under the helmet?
A: Totally, just remove the pads so you don’t add unnecessary bulkiness and you’re all set.
 
Q: I am a journalist, who do I contact for more information?
A: Please contact bck@dynamopr.com
 
Safety
Q: Is SOUNDSHIELD safe?
A: Yeah it is. We designed it comply with ASTM 2040, EN1077 and EN 1078. It has a 3 mm thick ABS shell and a 15-35 mm thick EPP Liner..that’s a lot of protection, we got you covered.
Q: How does music affect safety?
A: Action sports and music play well together. There's nothing like the right tune to shred some powder or hit the park. Most helmets today are audio kit compatible, but none of them have an interface that will let you pause or lower the volume as easily and as quickly. This means you'll be more accessible and less isolated. People that ride without helmets because they can't fit their everyday headphones in there, well, now they can. So we are for safety, not against :)  
 
Q: Is SOUNDSHIELD Waterproof?
A: The headphones are designed to be IP-X4 sweat proof. They can take sweat and snow without problem. Just don’t use them under heavy rain..(and don’t take them for a swim)
 
Q: Are the Headphones tough?
A: We built them to last. They can take on your active lifestyle without problem. Q:Does this meet helmet safety in Australia
A: We aim for the 3 major certifications worldwide. We won’t however, have Australian specific certifications.
 
Technical Q: How is the sound quality?
A: Pretty great. The headphones have 40mm drivers backed up with hand picked electrical components  to ensure optimal sound delivery. Shipping Q: I live outside of the US, what are my shipping costs?
A: Once you claim your perk, you will be prompted to choose your country for shipping.
Unless the perk says free shipping, each country will have a shipping cost. Choose yours.",73.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong>SAM</strong>SYTEMS is a small, but perfectly formed company  with the specific aim of resolving an age old problem with guitar amplification.  The team, who do this for a living, had wrestled for years with the significant shortfalls of traditional ""<i>close miking</i>"".</p>
<p><strong>The problem, in a nutshell, is that <i>""close miking""</i> ... isn't. It's not close enough. </strong></p>
<p>Conventional external microphones are very exposed to physical and sound interference on stage, hence the need for long sound checks, not to mention the terrors of overspill, feedback, wandering mikes, and  ""riding the desk"".</p>
<p>So, we have developed the internally mounted <strong>IN</strong>TEGRAL series which overcomes all of these problems, and greatly improves the purity &amp; accuracy of the sound that reaches your audience. And the professionals say:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>""utter genius!""</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>""awesome tone""</strong></p>
<p>As <strong>IN</strong>TEGRAL has been awarded 4.5/5 star rating in the <strong>prestigious iGuitar reviews</strong>.

<p> </p>
<p>The campaign offers <strong>IN</strong>TEGRAL, sized to match the two most common speakers diameters of 10"" &amp; 12"", at significantly discounted prices.  Having read more, and seen the lengthening list of expert testimonials,  we hope you will take the special opportunity to move onto the next big thing for guitar amplification, and ""<i>go <strong>IN</strong>TEGRAL</i>"".</p>

<p>If you pledge for a unit, you add to the fund that will allow us to complete manufacturing of the fully tested design, and make your model for you to become one of the earliest to adopt this new approach.  You are already in good company, but we'd like to make things easier for many more fellow players and engineers serious about getting the best to their audience.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Going <strong>IN</strong>TEGRAL just needs the final manufacturing and packaging steps to be completed.  It's all ready to go.  With $100,000 we can finalise the tooling and production with our selected manufacturers and distributors.</p>
<p>To help establish this new approach, we reduced the prices of <strong>IN</strong>TEGRAL for the duration of the campaign, thankful that you are willing to invest in a new technology. We are sure you will not be disappointed, as our expert testimonials show.   Please see our websites for more information. <a href=""http://www.samsystems-uk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.samsystems-uk.com,</a> and <u><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/samsysmicrophone/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/samsysmicrophone/</a>.  </u>Also please see our worldwide media announcements in the ""Updates"" section.

<p>The 10"" <strong>IN</strong>TEGRAL (IM10) is offered at only $60 (normal RRP $99), and the 12"" IM12 is priced at $70 (normal RRP $109). This also makes <strong>IN</strong>TEGRAL much less expensive than a traditional mike and stand, but it does things much better by virtue of its precise design and position within the speaker cab or combo.</p>
<p>Your initial purchase will be shipped in February 2017 as part of the first manufacturing run you are helping to fund.  It will come to you in bespoke packaging, stickers saying you have <i>""<strong>IN</strong>TEGRAL <strong>IN</strong>SIDE""</i> so the sound team knows they can sigh with relief, and clear instructions for the simple retro-fit.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Actually it's astonishing that this method has not been developed before. We have patents pending and the ""prior art"" for the concept.  But, it did take us three years of design and testing to perfect the carefully shaped housings, and the strategic off-centre ""aim"" of the super cardioid dynamic microphone, with its unique and exceptionally high/low full range frequency response, pressure tested at extreme volumes.</p>
<p>There are many ways <strong>IN</strong>TEGRAL has a positive impact for players, engineers and audiences:</p>
<p>* Balanced <strong>analogue</strong> output.      </p>
<p>* No power supplies, or batteries required.</p>
<p>* No onstage microphones or stands.</p>
<p>* Helps prevent overspill and feedback issues.</p>
<p>* Reduces band set up time.                         </p>
<p>* Quick, clean, ‘fit and forget’ installation.</p>
<p>* Robust, lightweight (6.5 ounces /196grams)</p>
<p>While these are great advantages for owners, <strong>IN</strong>TEGRAL also has the potential to boost the industry more widely, by creating a new and unique market, but also adding value to existing stocks, models, and older amplifiers. And its priced to give it accessible appeal. Success of the campaign would mean we can also manufacture for other speaker sizes.</p>
<p>By supporting our campaign you will be one of the first to ""raise the bar"", by using improved technique,  and adding something new to the music industry tool box.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Thankfully we cannot see any major risks.  Even if our fund is not fully reached, we have some private investment to help bridge the gap.</p>
<p>The big challenge is to make enough players and engineers aware that <strong>IN</strong>TEGRAL exists, and works so well.  We have press and reviews coming out in several big journals, but we'd also be truly grateful if you could spread the word via our connected social media, website and <i>YouTube</i>.</p>
<ul></ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't pledge, we'd be so grateful if you could help spread the word, and tell your peers about the technology, <strong>SAM</strong>SYSTEMS, and this campaign.</p>
<p>And for only a $5 pledge you might be quick enough to get a limited edition T-shirt signed by Grammy awarded producer <i>Gil Norton</i>, who uses <strong>IN</strong>TEGRAL, and has advised us in so many great ways.</p>
