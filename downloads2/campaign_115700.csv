After that I will have to hire another person who would take the Word files and convert them to a different formats with all that is required by Create Space and Kindle.

</h3> <p>Primero que mi nombre es Mónica Álvarez soy madre del pequeño Santiago de 4 años de edad. Santiago nació un 13 de julio del 2010, el bebe mas hermoso que su madre pudo tener en sus brazos, pero la felicidad fue opacada con una terrible noticia el había nacido con una malformación ano rectal y tendrían que hacerle mínimo 3 cirugías y al parecer le tendrían que hacer estudios de todo por que si ya había tenido una malformación era muy probable que acarreara muchas otras situaciones. Su primera cirugía fue el 14 de julio al día de nacido y le hicieron una colostomía para que pudiera obrar, estuvo internado 9 días y desde ahí empezaron todos los cuidados, los gastos y los estudios con el cardiologo, neurologo, traumatologo, endocrinólogo, terapistas, etc. en el seguro y particular por que obviamente uno como padre siempre quiere una segunda opinión y la necesidad de saber lo mas pronto posible como ayudar a tu hijo. Inicio sus terapias a los 2 meses de nacido, estimulación temprana, patrón cruzado, equino terapia, etc. Mensualmente tenia cita con el cirujano pediatra, neurologo, cardiologo, terapista, endocrinólogo y con el tiempo también clases de lenguaje. A los 13 meses le hicieron su segunda cirugía en el cual estuvo internado 12 días, con la gracias del creador todo salio excelente. Tomaba medicina anti convulsiva, para el hipotiroidismo y antibiótico para evitar las infecciones. a los 20 meses le hicieron su tercera cirugía para la cual estuvo internado 14 días y en ayuno 9. Santi es un guerrero, un luchador incansable, nunca se a dejado vencer y a luchado siempre con una gran sonrisa. Ha sido muy enfermizo entre las diarreas, las gripas y obviamente no puede todavía ir al baño adecuadamente debido a su situación, luchamos cada día por que se valla acostumbrando hacer del baño correctamente, no le gusta es una sensación nueva para el, dice que es feo hacer popo por la colita,  ya no usa pañal siempre lo hemos tratado como un niño normal y obviamente va a una escuela normal, sigue tomando medicinas para el hipotiroidismo, gracias a dios ya no toma medicina anti convulsiva el neurologo finalmente lo dio de alta y solo lo revisa semestralmente. Pero periódicamente tiene consulta con todos sus doctores, come de todo, claro esta que tiene que llevar un balance y comer sano para que pueda obrar correctamente. </p>

<p>Estoy aquí pidiendo de su apoyo para poder realizarle todos los estudios correspondientes, con todos los especialistas el cirujano, el neurologo, el cardiologo, la terapista, ahora el traumatologo que lo veo desde los 3 años por que desgraciadamente a raíz de todos los cuidados que necesito, de todos los doctores que visitamos, de todas las terapias que se pagaron hoy estamos mas en banca rota que nunca y no nos a importado los sacrificios yo como madre deje de trabajar 2 años para cuidarlo y dedicarme a el en cuerpo y alma, hasta que ya no pudimos mas con los gastos. Estamos aquí pidiendo apoyo para culminar con todo los estudios y terapias que le faltan en especial la de lenguaje que el requiere y pagar su escuela. Mi esposo y yo trabajamos de sol a sombra y solo para cubrir pagos de doctores y requerimientos especiales, pediatra, medicinas, vitaminas y terapias  pero desgraciadamente ya no podemos sostener esto mas. Este dinero se va directamente para pagar la terapia de lenguaje anual, la equino terapia anual, los estudios neurológicos (electroencefalograma), los estudios del cardiologo, los estudios del endocrinologo, el cirujano especialista, todas las consultas y todas las medicinas y vitaminas que le den o tratamientos y la escuela, y así nosotros podamos liquidar nuestras deudas y darle a Santi una vida de calidad, que a dios gracias este angelito a venido a llenar nuestra vida de alegría.</p>

<p></p><p>I am Dan C. Ionescu and I need your
help to create an amazing book. The book will encourage people to eat
healthier, have a well balanced diet and live better. My book offers simple
solutions to start eating better and includes the required 5+ portions of
fruits and vegetables in your diet.</p>
<p>Read this page carefully to get more
details.</p>
<p><b>Fact 1:</b>
At least 2.8 million people each year die as a result of being overweight or
obese (World Health Organization<span>  - </span><a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">who.int</a>)</p>
<p><b>Fact 2:</b>
Healthy diets rich in fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of cancer and
other chronic diseases. Fruits and vegetables also provide essential vitamins
and minerals, fiber, and other substances that are important for good health.
(Center Of Disease Control and Prevention <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/fruitsvegetables/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cdc.gov</a>)</p>
<p><b>Fact 3:</b>
The average American gets a total of just three servings of fruits and
vegetables a day (Harvard School of Public Health - <a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vegetables-full-story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">harvard.edu</a>)<span>  and other nations have the same problem!
People eat less vegetables and fruits than they should.</span></p>
<p><b>Most people are overwhelmed by the amount of
information put out by the health industry. They know the best way to feed
their family is to eat at least 5 portions of fruits and vegetables each day
for good health but they don’t know how to do it. It may seem hard to follow
the food guidelines but in fact it is really simple: by adding salads in your
diet!<span>  </span></b></p>
<p><i>Salads are extremely versatile</i>: they can be eaten as a side dish, starter or
as a main course, they can be enjoyed all day long – from breakfast to supper
and yes, a salad can replace a high calorie snack, are full of nutrients providing
your body the vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids, good fats and all the
chemicals which are good for you, and finally salads taste great. Also a salad
usually requires just minutes to prepare so even the busiest people can make a
salad.</p>
<p><b>The goal of my book is to show people that
salads can not only be healthy but also delicious and exciting</b>. The book will contain the most delicious
salad and dip recipes from all around the globe. Each recipe will be paired
with a high quality photo because it is true that <span>""<em>A picture</em> is <em>worth</em> a thousand words"". </span></p>
<p>This book will show how easy it is to
eat fruit and vegetables and enjoy a healthy life. Healthy foods should not be
bland; in fact salads are also tasty and healthy.</p>
<p>I am writing this book to make people
more aware that salads can be a full meal, can provide their daily fruit and
vegetable requirements and, to offer them recipe choices. There will be a lot
of recipes to suit all taste preferences and to cover breakfast, lunch, dinner,
and snacks.</p>
<p><b>About the book, “Salad cookbook. Over
150 Delicious Salad, Dressing, and Dip Recipes With Easy to Find Ingredients”</b></p><p></p><center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/528462/files/20140423103906-salad_cookbook_600x600.jpg?1398274746"" src="""" style=""width: 400px;""/></center><p></p>
<p>The book will show readers how easy and
delicious it is to have a healthy diet and how simple salads are to prepare.</p>
<p>We eat with our eyes first, so each recipe will
include an appealing image showing what the end result should look like.<span>  </span></p>
<p>The book will feature chapters about: how to
choose the ingredients, what kitchen equipment you need, my best tips and
tricks.</p>
<p>After the introduction the reader will find the
recipes paired with images. The book will start with the most popular salads
(which are found on most restaurant menus but a lot of people don’t know how to
make them at home, although it is very simple) and will move along to some of
the less known salads which I like to call the hidden gems.</p>
<p>The book contains plenty of salad recipes which
can be prepared with common ingredients. Everyone will be able to find a few
salads they will love.</p>
<p><b>Why Am I Writing this book?</b></p>
<p>I was overweight a large part on my
adult life and my diet wasn’t always as balanced as it is today. I have to
admit I was one of the people not eating the required daily 5+ portions of
fruits and vegetables and I considered salads to be a fad and boring.</p>
<p>But one day I started asking the right
questions like: Why am I an active person yet nearly obese? What is wrong with
my diet? And, How can I eat more fruit and vegetables and become more healthy?</p>
<p>On that day I also started looking for
answers, and things began to change. I read everything I could put my hands on
about food, healthy eating and cooking and now I want to pass on all that I
learned to change from being nearly obese to being healthy.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, I
discovered that eating fruit and vegetables is not only healthy it is delicious
too. And the easy way of adding more fruit and vegetables is with the help of
salads. Salads are extremely versatile and there are countless variations. </p>
<p>To show overweight and health
concerned individuals how simple it is to eat healthier I started writing the
“Salad cookbook. Over 150 Delicious Salad, Dressing, and Dip Recipes with Easy
to Find Ingredients”.</p>
<p>I think that everyone can benefit by
having a salad book in their library. </p>
<p><b>What makes the “Salad cookbook. Over
150 Delicious Salad, Dressing, and Dip Recipes With Easy to Find Ingredients”
Unique?</b></p>
<p>My book will show readers the easy way

<br/><p></p></div>","Hi,

I am Dan C. Ionescu and I need your
help to create an amazing book. The book will encourage people to eat
healthier, have a well balanced diet and live better. My book offers simple
solutions to start eating better and includes the required 5+ portions of
fruits and vegetables in your diet.
Read this page carefully to get more
details.
Fact 1:
At least 2.8 million people each year die as a result of being overweight or
obese (World Health Organization  - who.int)
Fact 2:
Healthy diets rich in fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of cancer and
other chronic diseases. Fruits and vegetables also provide essential vitamins
and minerals, fiber, and other substances that are important for good health.
(Center Of Disease Control and Prevention cdc.gov)
Fact 3:
The average American gets a total of just three servings of fruits and
vegetables a day (Harvard School of Public Health - harvard.edu)  and other nations have the same problem!
People eat less vegetables and fruits than they should.
Most people are overwhelmed by the amount of
information put out by the health industry. They know the best way to feed
their family is to eat at least 5 portions of fruits and vegetables each day
for good health but they don’t know how to do it. It may seem hard to follow
the food guidelines but in fact it is really simple: by adding salads in your
diet!  
Salads are extremely versatile: they can be eaten as a side dish, starter or
as a main course, they can be enjoyed all day long – from breakfast to supper
and yes, a salad can replace a high calorie snack, are full of nutrients providing
your body the vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids, good fats and all the
chemicals which are good for you, and finally salads taste great. Also a salad
usually requires just minutes to prepare so even the busiest people can make a
salad.
The goal of my book is to show people that
salads can not only be healthy but also delicious and exciting. The book will contain the most delicious
salad and dip recipes from all around the globe. Each recipe will be paired
with a high quality photo because it is true that ""A picture is worth a thousand words"". 
This book will show how easy it is to
eat fruit and vegetables and enjoy a healthy life. Healthy foods should not be
bland; in fact salads are also tasty and healthy.
I am writing this book to make people
more aware that salads can be a full meal, can provide their daily fruit and
vegetable requirements and, to offer them recipe choices. There will be a lot
of recipes to suit all taste preferences and to cover breakfast, lunch, dinner,
and snacks.
About the book, “Salad cookbook. Over
150 Delicious Salad, Dressing, and Dip Recipes With Easy to Find Ingredients”
The book will show readers how easy and
delicious it is to have a healthy diet and how simple salads are to prepare.
We eat with our eyes first, so each recipe will
include an appealing image showing what the end result should look like.  
The book will feature chapters about: how to
choose the ingredients, what kitchen equipment you need, my best tips and
tricks.
After the introduction the reader will find the
recipes paired with images. The book will start with the most popular salads
(which are found on most restaurant menus but a lot of people don’t know how to
make them at home, although it is very simple) and will move along to some of
the less known salads which I like to call the hidden gems.
The book contains plenty of salad recipes which
can be prepared with common ingredients. Everyone will be able to find a few
salads they will love.
Why Am I Writing this book?
I was overweight a large part on my
adult life and my diet wasn’t always as balanced as it is today. I have to
admit I was one of the people not eating the required daily 5+ portions of
fruits and vegetables and I considered salads to be a fad and boring.
But one day I started asking the right
questions like: Why am I an active person yet nearly obese? What is wrong with
my diet? And, How can I eat more fruit and vegetables and become more healthy?
On that day I also started looking for
answers, and things began to change. I read everything I could put my hands on
about food, healthy eating and cooking and now I want to pass on all that I
learned to change from being nearly obese to being healthy.
To make a long story short, I
discovered that eating fruit and vegetables is not only healthy it is delicious
too. And the easy way of adding more fruit and vegetables is with the help of
salads. Salads are extremely versatile and there are countless variations. 
To show overweight and health
concerned individuals how simple it is to eat healthier I started writing the
“Salad cookbook. Over 150 Delicious Salad, Dressing, and Dip Recipes with Easy
to Find Ingredients”.
I think that everyone can benefit by
having a salad book in their library. 
What makes the “Salad cookbook. Over
150 Delicious Salad, Dressing, and Dip Recipes With Easy to Find Ingredients”
Unique?
My book will show readers the easy way
of moving towards a healthier diet without compromising on taste.
Only the tastiest recipes will be
included in the book. Also the recipes will be beginner friendly so even people
with no kitchen skills will benefit from this book.
The book will contain enough recipes
and dips so everyone should find some they like.

<li>
<p>I’m an independent filmmaker
creator of “Real Time”, film that brought me a Guinness World Record™, being the first movie in
film history to have
been filmed as one long sequence without any camera cuts: an 86 minutes sequence
shot.</p>
<p>Since I was a teenager I devoted myself to
photography. </p>
</li> <li>I am currently presenting a photo exhibition
     called “Feminine Minds &amp; Sensitivity” in different cities of Mexico
     and Europe. In it, the conceptualization of each set emerges from the mind
     of every actress portrayed, becoming co-authors. I have been working on
     this collection in the past six years in countries as Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Mexico and now I have the dream to publish
     it on a beautiful art book.
</li> <li>With your fantastic help I’ll see my dream come true: to dedicate
     this book to my beautiful mother, who is my inspiration. Each photo
     you’ll see in this book is a tribute to all the gorgeous women portrayed and I want
     to bring a book copy to each one of them.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/674786/files/20140625115202-MSF_Postal_6_Eng.jpg?1403722322"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</li> </ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul>
<li>
<span>I will edit my photo book using
     a </span>$6,749 full color <span>editorial package
     that it will place the book on web stores as Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble. I’ll
     also hire a professional editorial designer to make it look awesome! And I'll cover the shipping costs to send the book to the models on it in different countries. </span>I’m not looking to re-cover my production costs, shooting
     hours, post-production work on the images and beers drunk in this period, because I did it with all my
     love.
</li> <li>If you help me, you can get The Book! Or at least, I’ll send you a set of 8 different signed photos of this collection
     in different sizes, from large photo prints to small
     postcards. I also can offer you a free photo
     session if you come to Veracruz State, or if you bring me wherever you
     are!
</li> <li>
<p>If I don’t
reach my goal, I’ll get a smaller package to publish my book. I’ll print it anyway!</p>

</ul><p></p></div>","Short Summary 

I’m an independent filmmaker
creator of “Real Time”, film that brought me a Guinness World Record™, being the first movie in
film history to have
been filmed as one long sequence without any camera cuts: an 86 minutes sequence
shot.
Since I was a teenager I devoted myself to
photography. 
 I am currently presenting a photo exhibition
     called “Feminine Minds & Sensitivity” in different cities of Mexico
     and Europe. In it, the conceptualization of each set emerges from the mind
     of every actress portrayed, becoming co-authors. I have been working on
     this collection in the past six years in countries as Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Mexico and now I have the dream to publish
     it on a beautiful art book.
 With your fantastic help I’ll see my dream come true: to dedicate
     this book to my beautiful mother, who is my inspiration. Each photo
     you’ll see in this book is a tribute to all the gorgeous women portrayed and I want
     to bring a book copy to each one of them.
   What We Need & What You Get 

I will edit my photo book using
     a $6,749 full color editorial package
     that it will place the book on web stores as Amazon and Barnes & Noble. I’ll
     also hire a professional editorial designer to make it look awesome! And I'll cover the shipping costs to send the book to the models on it in different countries. I’m not looking to re-cover my production costs, shooting
     hours, post-production work on the images and beers drunk in this period, because I did it with all my
     love.
 If you help me, you can get The Book! Or at least, I’ll send you a set of 8 different signed photos of this collection
     in different sizes, from large photo prints to small
     postcards. I also can offer you a free photo
     session if you come to Veracruz State, or if you bring me wherever you
     are!
 
If I don’t
reach my goal, I’ll get a smaller package to publish my book. I’ll print it anyway!

<p><strong>THE STORY</strong></p>
<p>My third-great uncle, William Scoresby, was an Arctic explorer, whaling ship captain, naturalist, inventor, mechanical engineer, clergyman, social activist, lecturer and author. He explored new territory in the Arctic, wrote the first book of polar science, and kicked off the quest to find the Northwest Passage. Charles Darwin took his books with him on the H.M.S. <i>Beagle</i>, and in the 19th century Scoresby was as famous as John James Audubon or Marie Curie.</p>
<p>Though he is all but forgotten today, his discoveries are now helping scientists understand climate change in the Arctic. Information from his voyages 200 years ago is providing new insight for scientists to predict future changes in our environment.</p>
<p><strong>My new book about this incredible adventurer will show how his exploration and scientific innovation continue to shape our world.</strong></p>
<p>I plan to take a 10-day research trip to three British cities connected with Scoresby--Whitby, London and Liverpool--and uncover new clues about his life for this book.</p>
<p>Scoresby was born in 1789 in Whitby, a quaint coastal town in northeast England. When he passed away in 1857, he donated all of his personal letters, diaries, logbooks and other papers to the Whitby Museum. I’ll spend at least a week reading and analyzing this huge but mostly unorganized collection to learn more about who Scoresby was. I’ll be looking for correspondence with contemporary explorers and scientists, including Darwin himself. In London and Liverpool, I’ll visit maritime museums and walk the same streets as Scoresby did almost two centuries ago.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the materials I find on my trip will enrich the biography I’m writing, and reveal new stories about my own family. I’m looking forward to sharing his exciting and inspiring life with the world.</p>

<p><strong>THE BUDGET</strong></p>

<p><i>Groomed</i> looks at the unfortunate narrative of childhood sexual assault that is a reality for countless American children. The emotional book challenges readers to learn from the stories of survivors to create safer, more loving communities.<br/><br/>My name is Samantha Leonard and I am the author of <i>Groomed</i>. I wrote this book to connect with other sexual assault survivors and advocates for survivors and shed light on the issue of childhood sexual assault.<br/><br/>My hope is that by reading this book you will gain a new understanding of what childhood sexual assault means, the grooming process and how it effects survivors. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion that I have for changing the culture around sexual violence. Then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to educate readers on tangible ways to support themselves, our children and the survivors among our communities.<br/><br/><strong>In this book, you'll learn about the sexual grooming process and ways to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Speak with survivors</p></li>
<li><p>Spot the signs of sexual predator</p></li>
<li><p>Respond empathetically if someone discloses an assault to you</p></li>
<li><p>Prevent assault</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you or someone you love has been effected by sexual violence or if you are interested in healing survivors and communities.<br/><br/><i>Groomed</i> is a fictional book based on real stories that speaks to those effected by sexual violence and the #metoo movement who are interested in learning more about the status quo of childhood sexual assault and ways to be a catalyst for change.</p>
<p>The Book - <i>Groomed</i></p>
<p>The book is written in 6 main parts that break down the grooming process used to manipulate children....</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Part 1</strong> describes how sexual groomers select victims. Here, I  begin to tell a fictional story based on real experiences of survivors and point out ways to minimize children's vulnerability to abuse.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part 2</strong> explains how sexual groomers gain victims' trust. This section continues to detail a fictional account that illustrate ways survivors trust is gained and concludes with red flags to look for in the adults that children interact with.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part 3 </strong>looks at how sexual groomers fill need(s) for their victim(s) and shares how that process played a role in the fictional story of abuse shared. Here, I also list warning signs often seen in children who are already being abused.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part 4</strong> describes how sexual groomer's isolate victims in a fictional story.  The section sums up with some valuable lessons communities can learn from these stories.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part 5 </strong>details how sexual groomers sexualize the relationship they have formed. It then offers a fictional narration of how survivors have experienced that progression. Part five also lists reasons why survivors do not come forward and how law enforcement can better respond to survivors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part 6</strong> depicts how sexual groomers maintain control over their victims. Then, a story of how that control plays out for victims are introduced. Finally, I discuss empathetic ways to respond to survivors that disclose their assault to you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>

I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you.

I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

<h3>Love, Light, Joy &amp; Justice: How To Be A Christian Now</h3>
<p>When I was kicked out of my evangelical denomination for our stance on marriage equality and the full inclusion of our LGBTQ siblings and neighbors, I thought everything was over. Stripped of all our funding and support, lies and hate were spread by the very people that called us ""church family."" In my grief, I thought everything was over. But, as it turns out, our journey was just beginning... and in many ways, we received a preview of what would befall our country and churches with the election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th President. </p>
<ul>
<li>What does it mean to live out loud Jesus' call to Love amidst the division and violence of empire?</li>
<li>What does it mean to stand in the Light in a world full of lies?</li>
<li>How might we work through our grief and choose Joy?</li>
<li>What does it look like to seek social Justice when so much is stacked against all of us?</li>
</ul>
<p>In my first book, I share my story as a way to illumine a path forward for all of us. It was really important for me to get this word out quickly, and in our own way, so that we could offer free e-book previews and discounted paperback editions in order to help as many friends as possible navigate these divisive, concerning times.</p>
<p><i>Kids separated from their families and locked in cages... white supremacy on the streets of Charlottesville and Portland, and thousands of lies on the regular on our airwaves and social media... all done in the name of God?</i></p>

<p><i><strong>“Here is a book as necessary </strong>for today as breath.

<p><i><strong>In THE BOOK OF CALM, </strong>Nancy Shapiro elegantly interweaves personal experience with the hard-won wisdom of growth and transformation.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I Found Jesus Through Anxiety and Depression is all about the mental health stigma in society and faith circles alike. It begins with my personal journey and experience with the societal view of mental health and ends with information on all the pieces I touch on in my personal experience.<br/><br/>My name is Kay Smeal and I am the author of I Found Jesus Through Anxiety and Depression.

My hope is that by sharing my story I am creating the space for others to share their own stories and experience.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that you are not alone in this battle with mental illness. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for breaking the stigma around mental health and building up community not barriers. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you find the confidence and beauty that is contained in your own story.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the mental health stigmas and the shame and blame that comes alongside each. You'll hear stories such as...</p>

<p>Finding acceptance with my diagnosis and realizing I am not my diagnosis.</p>
<p>My experience in an inpatient facility and hope for those who seek help in this way.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you struggle with a mental illness diagnosis, or know someone who struggles, and are feeling alone in the community that surrounds you.<br/><br/>I Found Jesus Through Anxiety and Depression is a nonfiction book that speaks to mental health warriors and supporters of those who struggle who want to look at the mental health stigma and the consequences of harmful thoughts in a new way.</p>
<p>The Book - I Found Jesus Through Anxiety and Depression</p>
<p>IF BOOK IS DIVIDED INTO PARTS:<br/><br/>The book is written in 2 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters [1-5].

In This Part readers will find information and resources on various mental health diagnoses and what comes along with many diagnoses. I dive into topics on support systems, in-patient facilities, and much more.</p>

Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you find the confidence and beauty that is contained in your own story.In this book, you'll learn about the mental health stigmas and the shame and blame that comes alongside each. You'll hear stories such as...
My first encounter informing the church that I was struggling with Anxiety and Depression.
Finding acceptance with my diagnosis and realizing I am not my diagnosis.
My experience in an inpatient facility and hope for those who seek help in this way.
You will love this book if you struggle with a mental illness diagnosis, or know someone who struggles, and are feeling alone in the community that surrounds you.I Found Jesus Through Anxiety and Depression is a nonfiction book that speaks to mental health warriors and supporters of those who struggle who want to look at the mental health stigma and the consequences of harmful thoughts in a new way.
The Book - I Found Jesus Through Anxiety and Depression
IF BOOK IS DIVIDED INTO PARTS:The book is written in 2 parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters [1-5]. Through my personal experience with facing the mental health stigma in churches head on and battle with the stigma around mental health medication, the reader will learn there are others out there who are facing the same situations they are.Part 2 contains chapters [6-11]. In This Part readers will find information and resources on various mental health diagnoses and what comes along with many diagnoses. I dive into topics on support systems, in-patient facilities, and much more.

What We Need & What You Get
This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:
-The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2021.
-The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)
-The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
-The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
-The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring
When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.
About the Author
Kay Smeal is a current graduate student at Perkins School of Theology. She graduated from Messiah College in 2019. She is also the author of Anxious Devotions for Anxious Christians: A 30-Day Devotional.Kay Smeal wrote this book because she found the silence around the mental health stigma to be deafening. Her hope is that by sharing her story she is creating the space for others to share their own stories and experiences.When Kay is not in class or leading her youth group, she can be found blogging, napping, or curled up with a good book with my dog Hank. Her favorite animal is a sloth. And she can always be found with a colored pen.For more information, you can connect with Kay Smeal at anxiousdevotions@gmail.com and at @Kay_Smeal_Author. 
The Impact

I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:
-You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.
-Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.

-You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.
-You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.
-And much more!

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #JesusADKay and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so that we can help amplify your efforts.

<h3 style=""text-align: right;"">La Novela</h3>
<p>Tres personas están a punto de librar una entrañable confrontación luego de que la policía haya descubierto una serie de cadáveres brutalmente mutilados.

I want you to see this book as an opportunity to realize that creative thinking, resilience, and grit are, in fact, the most important factors to attaining success both professionally and personally.

This includes the story of a Big Law associate who, after years of feeling overworked and burnt out, decided to establish their own company. It includes the story of a technical writer who, after experiencing an intense bout of depression after getting fired from his dream job, was able to find solace in creative writing, which landed him a job at Google.

We might be the Underdogs, but it’s never over until we say it is.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you’ve ever been told that your chances at having a successful career were truncated due to a low grade point average, if you’ve ever felt lost in whatever academic program you decided to pursue because you thought everyone else was too smart, or if you’ve ever shied away from applying for your dream job or starting your own company because you were afraid of failure or that others would ridicule you. This story is for the underdogs who lost faith in themselves somewhere along the way because someone—a professor, counselor, or parent—told them that they weren’t enough—that they should give up and try something else. If you fall into any of these categories, I know this book will speak to you.<br/><br/>Underdog speaks to the despondent law students who came out of their first year of law school with grades that didn’t match how hard they worked or how intelligent they are. It speaks to those who want to grapple with the relationship between long-term career success and the grades they receive in school in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Underdog inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>
<li>What's stopping me from applying to the job of my dreams?</li>
<li>Are the people who make it to the top really only those who graduated first in their class? </li>

<p><u><strong>Who We Are and What We Are Doing</strong></u></p>
<p>Marshay Artrell Mitchell is an artist, poet, model and world traveler. She is moved by the impact her poetry and art has on others. For her, creating and sharing poetry is an honor and a joy because she wants to create an experience that is uplifting and enjoyable for those reading her poems, observing her art or listening to her read her stories. Through poetry, Marshay often feels like a storyteller, a student, a teacher, and an uplifter!  Click here to learn more about Marshay.</p>
<p>Kris Parfitt Travers is a writer, artist, traveler and founder of Story Launch Media. Her purpose in life is to generate a tsunami of inspiration where all people experience their greatness being expressed and acknowledged, and for them to inspire the greatness in others being expressed and acknowledged.</p>
<p>She and Marshay have similar desires to create extraordinary experiences through the written and spoken word that inspire others to be uplifted. Click here to learn more about Story Launch Media.</p>
<p>Marshay has wanted to publish a book of her poetry and Kris wants to publish books of stories, poetry and art. It's a perfect partnership - these two women are intentionally cultivating inspiration through Marshay's book of poetry.</p>
<p>They are inviting their communities to support the project by pre-purchasing a book -  or two, or more - to help raise the funds necessary to create, print and publish this project.</p>
<p><u><strong>What We Need and What You Get</strong></u></p>
<p>We are crowdfunding for $3025. This amount will be used to support the cost of creating, printing and publishing a first-run print of approximately 400 books. </p>
<p>Knowing there will be fees and taxes associated with crowdfunding, we are asking for more than we need to print 400 books. We hope that those supporting this project understand this need and will still contribute to the cost of the project.</p>
<p>The impact of your funding will be four-fold!</p>
<p><strong>  - Marshay will be a published poet! </strong></p>

Marshay Artrell Mitchell is an artist, poet, model and world traveler. She is moved by the impact her poetry and art has on others. For her, creating and sharing poetry is an honor and a joy because she wants to create an experience that is uplifting and enjoyable for those reading her poems, observing her art or listening to her read her stories. Through poetry, Marshay often feels like a storyteller, a student, a teacher, and an uplifter!  Click here to learn more about Marshay.
Kris Parfitt Travers is a writer, artist, traveler and founder of Story Launch Media. Her purpose in life is to generate a tsunami of inspiration where all people experience their greatness being expressed and acknowledged, and for them to inspire the greatness in others being expressed and acknowledged.
She and Marshay have similar desires to create extraordinary experiences through the written and spoken word that inspire others to be uplifted. Click here to learn more about Story Launch Media.
Marshay has wanted to publish a book of her poetry and Kris wants to publish books of stories, poetry and art. It's a perfect partnership - these two women are intentionally cultivating inspiration through Marshay's book of poetry.
They are inviting their communities to support the project by pre-purchasing a book -  or two, or more - to help raise the funds necessary to create, print and publish this project.
What We Need and What You Get
We are crowdfunding for $3025. This amount will be used to support the cost of creating, printing and publishing a first-run print of approximately 400 books. 
Knowing there will be fees and taxes associated with crowdfunding, we are asking for more than we need to print 400 books. We hope that those supporting this project understand this need and will still contribute to the cost of the project.
The impact of your funding will be four-fold!
  - Marshay will be a published poet! 
  - Story Launch Media will have published its first book! 
  - Our community members will know that they supported a creative gift that will uplift thousands of people! 
   - And you will be the first to receive this accomplishment before it is picked up by bookstores and offered for sale on Amazon!
We know everyone has a price for what they will pay for something extraordinary! So we have come up with incentives for people to pre-order a book.
The cost of one book and having it mailed to you will be $25. Our incentives start there and go up to $100. Incentives include a personalized note in the front of the book signed by Marshay!
Or for $5 more you can have your name mentioned in the acknowledgements shared in back of the book.
For even $5 more you can have all the above PLUS be invited to the pre-launch party!
And for a bit more extra you can receive more book amounts to give as gifts.
The final package offers the experience of being an Intentional Cultivator* for the project and having your name listed as such in the first few pages of the book!
*We define an Intentional Cultivator as someone who purposefully applies oneself to developing an exceptional person or thing.
You are welcome to pay more than $100 if you would like to support the project!
We also respect that some people aren't able to contribute financially, but can contribute time or effort! We would greatly appreciate the efforts of sharing this campaign with your own communities, or finding a place for Marshay to read her poetry before or after the book launches. And so much more!

<p>Je suis Hubert Jadotte. Juriste. Ancien inspecteur de Police. Un passionné de lecture et d'écriture. Un auteur qui s'annonce prolifique vu les œuvres existantes et des publications éparses. Ma publication la plus récente est éditée chez Edilivre France ; elle s’intitule La lune est une île, poésie disponible sur Amazon. Mes œuvres varient en des essais en sciences sociales, en littérature, etc. et abondantes en poésie.</p>
<p>Mon projet consiste en la publication de l'important ouvrage titré Police, Justice et Sécurité publique en Haïti / Comment désarmer l'insécurité? Il s'agit d'un essai de 372 pages sur la sécurité policière, judiciaire et sociétale. Le livre postule pour un type de citoyen qui prend son pays, son avenir et celui de ses enfants très au sérieux et qui incite l'Etat par le biais de son gouvernement à devenir un agent régulateur actif, réactif et proactif conformément aux aspirations de la population, grâce à une nouvelle méthode de vigilance vers la responsabilisation. </p>
<p>La campagne est un appel vibrant à l'appui de la publication du livre. Notre constat révèle que la sécurité au XXIe siècle devient une valeur globalisante. Le monde en fait n'est autre qu'un village où les hommes se déplacent incessamment. Mais quand c'est l'insécurité qui fait la loi dans n'importe quel pays de la planète, la menace concerne, qu'on le veuille ou non toute la population mondiale active. D'où soi-même, ses amis ou ses proches ne sont nullement exempts. C'est pourquoi, j'exhorte tous à supporter spontanément les initiatives visant à désarmer les insécurités, et en l’occurrence la présente campagne. Je dis les insécurités dans le sens de la délinquance, la pauvreté, le chômage, la faim, la corruption, etc. </p>
<p>Cette publication sera pour moi un vrai tremplin au point de vue de notoriété. Cela va être l'essence nécessaire au décollage de l'engin. Ce sera pour mon pays un outil qui jouera un rôle majeur dans son relèvement dans la mesure qu'elle trouverait la presse suffisante. Cette contrée d'une curiosité étonnante. Curiosité même pour moi qui suis natif de cette terre. Venir en aide à ce projet c'est participer à la concrétisation de plusieurs rêves à la fois et mieux encore des rêves grandioses. </p>
<p>Fort de cela, les contributeurs et les contributrices à cette campagne partent en champion. Champion d'une cause noble, juste et passionnante. Soyez enthousiastes et généreux. Des contributions désintéressées peuvent parfois se révéler des garanties pour les intérêts communs.</p>
<p>Les fonds recherchés pour cette campagne s'élèvent 5700 dollars américains répartis comme suit : $4000 pour l'impression de 1000 exemplaires du livre. $ 1700 pour les opérations de la publication, à savoir des tournées de conférences-débats et vente-signature à travers les principales villes du pays, dont Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haitien, Gonaïves, Port-de-Paix, Jacmel et Cayes, pour les frais de voyage, d'hôtels, consommation.  A raison de deux soirées par ville, excepté (concernant les frais de séjour) Port-au-Prince et Port-de-Paix, respectivement ville de résidence et ville d'origine de l'auteur. Y compris la couverture médiatique tant locale que nationale.</p>
<p>Il sera, on ne peut plus, fascinant pour moi de débattre avec cœur sur les perspectives de voir mon pays parvenir à atteindre un seuil de sécurité qui attirera même les personnes les plus précautionnées à venir visiter un jour ou un autre ce joyau tellement maltraité. Et aussi prendre de manière irréversible le chemin de la stabilité, de la confiance, du développement, et une destination alléchante et heureuse pour le monde entier. Du vrai bonheur!</p> <p>Au cas où cette campagne n'atteindrait pas l'objectif poursuivi, les fonds recueillis seront déposés dans un compte spécial, en attendant la remobilisation d'autres fonds complémentaires. Puisque même la nature dans son aspect peu clémente ne tolérerait pas qu'un pareil ouvrage reste dans les tiroirs. Lorsque l'objectif ultime de remobilisation sera atteint, une nouvelle campagne restitutrice à ce moment-là sera lancée en vue d'honorer toutes nos promesses de contreparties. Ce qui confirmera qu' « il n'est jamais trop tard pour bien faire »!</p> <p>C'est une évidence, dans ce monde globalisé aucun effort pour la sécurité générale n'est personnelle à un Etat ou à un peuple, même si des grands de ce monde viendraient en désaveu. Donc tout contributeur, même si on ne sent à l'instant même la nécessite d'adhérer se dira l'instant plus tard, cela vaut la peine de contribuer à cet intéressant projet. </p>
<p>Pour moi qui attends le moindre vent pour s'impulser et ce pays situé en plein cœur de l'Amérique centrale pour se renaître, du coup une valeur-ajoutée mondiale.

<p>Cette campagne qui permettra l'impression de 1000 exemplaires, sera le tout début du succès de ce livre. D'autant que c'est le minimum qu'une imprimerie réalise.

<p>We published our first print issue in March 2010 under the moniker ""Asterisk San Francisco,"" a bi-monthly, 64-page square format free publication distributed exclusively in SF. For years, we focused on the city's inspiring culture from small mom &amp; pop businesses to emerging artists and iconic communities.</p>
<p>We told hundreds of stories with sustainability, community, and compassion at heart. In 2013, we took on a new format and name; The New Asterisk. Our new quarterly magazine was sold in bookstores and newsstands nationwide and internationally in 14 countries; telling more stories beyond our 49 square mile borders. As we scaled, our approach to storytelling remained unchanged. We've been lucky to have such a supportive community of writers, photographers, creatives, and readers, to whom we are deeply grateful.</p>
<p>We hope to continue our journey with you! Whether you're a first time reader or a long time lover, welcome to The New Asterisk family.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>ISSUE XI - Happiness</h3>
<p>We started putting together this issue back in 2016. Happiness was scarce and it seemed to be getting worse every day with depressing news cycles and social media dragging people's emotions. After much contemplation, we had to freeze the issue while our community worked on the changing face of our collective existence in these trying times. Now, more than ever, we need a reminder of our optimistic vision for the future. Let us uplift our community, spread love, and work hard to create a just world in the spirit of San Francisco. A world of acceptance, equality, compassion, and creativity. To us, this is the essence of San Francisco.</p>
<p>Join us on our journey to craft a better future, together!</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
We published our first print issue in March 2010 under the moniker ""Asterisk San Francisco,"" a bi-monthly, 64-page square format free publication distributed exclusively in SF. For years, we focused on the city's inspiring culture from small mom & pop businesses to emerging artists and iconic communities.
We told hundreds of stories with sustainability, community, and compassion at heart. In 2013, we took on a new format and name; The New Asterisk. Our new quarterly magazine was sold in bookstores and newsstands nationwide and internationally in 14 countries; telling more stories beyond our 49 square mile borders. As we scaled, our approach to storytelling remained unchanged. We've been lucky to have such a supportive community of writers, photographers, creatives, and readers, to whom we are deeply grateful.
We hope to continue our journey with you! Whether you're a first time reader or a long time lover, welcome to The New Asterisk family.
 

WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT!
Once we reach our goal, we'll be able to work on our follow up issue, pay our contributors and start planning for our next publication year. 
Surpassing our goal will allow us to have the best Live Magazine Event later in the year with commissioned works from artists in a range of disciplines, activating our creative community in the Bay Area. 
We ship worldwide! Get the new issue on your coffee tables by mid-August. 
 
ISSUE XI - Happiness
We started putting together this issue back in 2016. Happiness was scarce and it seemed to be getting worse every day with depressing news cycles and social media dragging people's emotions. After much contemplation, we had to freeze the issue while our community worked on the changing face of our collective existence in these trying times. Now, more than ever, we need a reminder of our optimistic vision for the future. Let us uplift our community, spread love, and work hard to create a just world in the spirit of San Francisco. A world of acceptance, equality, compassion, and creativity. To us, this is the essence of San Francisco.
Join us on our journey to craft a better future, together!

<p>das erste Nilpferd der Welt. Vor langer Zeit erblickte ich in Ägypten das Licht der Welt. Als ich alt genug dafür war, begab ich mich auf eine Weltreise und lernte andere Tiere kennen.</p>
<p>Weil ich mit meinen dicken Füßen so schlecht schreiben kann, hat Niklas mir geholfen meine Erlebnisse niederzuschreiben und zu einem Buch zusammenzufassen. Er begleitet mich schon seit meiner Geburt.</p>
<p>Und weißt du, damals gab es noch keine Kameras. Daher musste ich mir alles, was ich erlebt hatte, merken. Allerdings verhält es sich mit dem Malen und Zeichnen wie mit dem Schreiben: meine Füße sind einfach nicht dafür gemacht. Daher hat mir Verena Geiger (<a href=""http://www.verenageiger.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.verenageiger.de</a>) geholfen, meine Erinnerung zu verbildlichen.</p>
<p>Dieses Buch, in das ich viel Zeit und Arbeit gesteckt habe, möchte ich euch gerne vorstellen. Es gibt da nur einen kleinen Haken. Da ich den ganzen Tag schwimme, esse, reise und mit meinem besten Freund Erdmannson in alten Zeiten schwelge, habe ich leider keine Geldbörse. Selbst wenn ich eine hätte, wäre da nichts drin. Glücklicherweise konnte ich mit der Hilfe von vielen Unterstützern den Druck Finanzieren. Das heißt du kannst dir jetzt schon das Buch reservieren. Im November wird es versandt und dann hast du ein passendes Weihnachtsgeschenk für viele Kinder! (Mehr dazu erfährst du weiter unten)</p>
<p>Aber ich möchte Euch natürlich nicht den Nils im Sack verkaufen (wie man bei uns so schön sagt), hier ist eine kleine Leseprobe:</p>

<p>Vor langer, langer Zeit lebten einmal zwei verfeindete Familien an dem Fluss Nil. Die Familie der Nilse und die Familie der Pferde. Warum die beiden sich bis aufs Haar nicht leiden konnten, wusste niemand so genau. Der Grund dafür war noch viel älter als die Geschichte selbst. Zu jener Zeit verliebten sich eine wunderschöne Dame der Pferde und ein stattlicher Mann der Nilse ineinander. Die beiden kümmerten sich wenig um die Feindschaft ihrer beiden Familien. Denn miteinander waren sie sehr glücklich. Nach einiger Zeit erfüllte sich auch ihr innigster Wunsch. Sie bekamen ein Kind. Das erste Nilpferd, wie wir es heute kennen. Sie nannten es Nilpferdson.""</p>

One which engages with our texts with a viewpoint beyond the standard right-wing and/or Ashkenormative frame that dominates most other Orthodox Jewish commentary.</p>
<p>Of course, that's not to say that it will be left-leaning just to be left, either.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Oil Paper Family </i>follows the story of my grandfather, Young Bok Kim, through his childhood as a farm boy in rural North Korea in the 1930s living beneath three oppressive regimes, and his eventual escape to South Korea during the Korean War. <br/><br/>My name is Melanie Kim and I am the author of <i>Oil Paper Family</i>. I grew up lingering over these stories of my grandfather’s life. There were stories of his childhood and his school, blooming azalea mountainsides and lazy afternoons eating melons in the shade of a river shack. But there were also stories of Japanese colonialism, war, near-death experiences, and loss. <br/><br/>I wrote this book because of how my grandfather looked while he was telling me the stories of his life. Immense pain and sorrow, guilt and joy were etched into the lines of his face. When he held my hand and told me about his siblings and his mother, when I saw so much passion and life and resilience... I don’t know how I could <i>not</i> write this book! <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the individual experiences of the older generations who lived through Japanese Imperialism, WWII, Korean War, and communist rule. I hope you come to feel as I do: that though my grandfather’s story weaves into the rich tapestry of my Korean heritage, his story is not just Korean; it is a story of humanity and resiliency and strength. And finally, I hope that this book inspires you to ask and take the time to listen to the stories of a loved one. I hope that you get to hold their hand when they’re crying, when they laugh, when they tell you something that they’ve never told anyone else. I hope you get to see that beautifully intimate moment when they are talking about that person that they love best in the entire world. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the life of a man who deeply loved his family, who was passionate about his education, and was bent on survival. You'll follow him through decades of conflict and war, joys and burdens. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Young Bok’s experiences in school beneath the Japanese colonialist system, specifically in a conflict with his friends over the rule against speaking Korean</li>
<li>The work of Young Bok’s mother (whom he always called a “superhero”) to tend to the farm, raise silkworms, weave clothing, and raise seven children</li>
<li>The cold early morning in 1950 when Young Bok woke with a crumbled handful of soybean cake in his hands and a pouch of paper money warm against his chest, remembering the day before when he had watched his entire family make their way back towards their northern hometown, while he struck out alone towards the south. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Oil Paper Family</i> is a creative nonfiction book that speaks to anyone interested in stories of human resilience or a part of history that is not well addressed in the US. </p>

<h3>About the Author </h3>
<p>Melanie Kim is a student at Brown University studying Medical Anthropology.<br/><br/>Melanie started writing this book because of the way that her grandfather inspired her with his stories.

Oil Paper Family follows the story of my grandfather, Young Bok Kim, through his childhood as a farm boy in rural North Korea in the 1930s living beneath three oppressive regimes, and his eventual escape to South Korea during the Korean War. My name is Melanie Kim and I am the author of Oil Paper Family. I grew up lingering over these stories of my grandfather’s life. There were stories of his childhood and his school, blooming azalea mountainsides and lazy afternoons eating melons in the shade of a river shack. But there were also stories of Japanese colonialism, war, near-death experiences, and loss. I wrote this book because of how my grandfather looked while he was telling me the stories of his life. Immense pain and sorrow, guilt and joy were etched into the lines of his face. When he held my hand and told me about his siblings and his mother, when I saw so much passion and life and resilience... I don’t know how I could not write this book! My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the individual experiences of the older generations who lived through Japanese Imperialism, WWII, Korean War, and communist rule. I hope you come to feel as I do: that though my grandfather’s story weaves into the rich tapestry of my Korean heritage, his story is not just Korean; it is a story of humanity and resiliency and strength. And finally, I hope that this book inspires you to ask and take the time to listen to the stories of a loved one. I hope that you get to hold their hand when they’re crying, when they laugh, when they tell you something that they’ve never told anyone else. I hope you get to see that beautifully intimate moment when they are talking about that person that they love best in the entire world. In this book, you'll learn about the life of a man who deeply loved his family, who was passionate about his education, and was bent on survival. You'll follow him through decades of conflict and war, joys and burdens. You'll hear stories such as...

Young Bok’s experiences in school beneath the Japanese colonialist system, specifically in a conflict with his friends over the rule against speaking Korean
The work of Young Bok’s mother (whom he always called a “superhero”) to tend to the farm, raise silkworms, weave clothing, and raise seven children
The cold early morning in 1950 when Young Bok woke with a crumbled handful of soybean cake in his hands and a pouch of paper money warm against his chest, remembering the day before when he had watched his entire family make their way back towards their northern hometown, while he struck out alone towards the south. 

Oil Paper Family is a creative nonfiction book that speaks to anyone interested in stories of human resilience or a part of history that is not well addressed in the US.

<h3>
<b>Q.</b><strong>  So if Fluorescence is so groundbreaking, why does it need funding?</strong>
</h3>
<p><b><br/>A.</b>  Good question! <b>The answer to that is simple</b> - <b>funding </b>= <b>marketing</b>. <b>Marketing </b>= the <b>ability to build a fan-base and gain an audience,</b> which in turn, can <b>= success</b>.
 Think about it: how many books/movies/TV Shows, etc. would you have 
found out about or purchased if you'd never seen a commercial/flyer/or 
other promotional blurb about it? Probably few to none.</p>
<p>No matter how good something is, if no one knows it exists, it can't 
make an impact. This doesn't mean it's not a good product, it often only
 means the marketing failed.

<h3>The Project<br/>
</h3>
<p><b>We always wanted to make a horror collection...</b></p>
<p>It was late in the evening. Christopher Earnings (DimensionBucket) got a message from his fellow writer and ""CreepyPasta"" narrator Josh Reeves (Awkward Thursdays.) He announced this idea he had, which involved taking the best writing they had, and collecting them into one huge anthology. Over the course of time, more stories were written, and other authors decided to join in. Here we are today, with a short story collection with over thirty horrifying tales of the macabre. Throughout the book, we are also including original artwork by Major Moose<br/></p>
<p>We were really happy the way the book came out, and even more joyous when Mr. CreepyPasta, WellHey Productions, LitterBot, HauntingSeason, GentlemanWalrus, and many others agreed to record guest narrations for the audiobook. Now, you can hear the stories of ""Neighborhood Kids"" brought to life in audio form.</p>
<p>Anyhow, we're really excited to present our project to the world, and hope you're as excited as we are.</p>
<p></p>

<br/><p></p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Hello Folks,</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>I’m Samuel Rhod. I’m here to tell you a little bit about this massive venture that we’re all putting together for you, the fans. We’ve painstakingly edited and written a collection of over thirty short horror stories for your pleasure. We’re very proud of what we have done and it’s a large undertaking so far. The group is facing some rather difficult odds and I know it seems like we’re asking for much. In truth we are doing what we can to keep your expenses down while making a small margin of profit to get you a copy of the book.</p>
<p>The group will be self publishing this book out to you, the fans, in various different forms. We’ll have several narrators reading for the audio book, including Murphy of WellHeyProductions and Josh from Haunting Season, a few other unconfirmed guests, and ourselves. Your funds will be used to power this well oiled machine in which will turn out the pages you will hold in your hands. We will then use the money left over to meet you all for a panel at Delta-H Con for a Theatre Obscurum panel where you can ask us all sorts of questions.</p>
<p>We are all proficient writers and we have had many others give us feedback on the stories with generally positive reviews. Between Geoffri C. Nelvon, Christopher Earnings, Josh Reeves, Jacob Emory, and myself we’re looking at a team of heavy hitters who’ll get the job done for you all. So far all of the stories are written and we are currently still editing a bit, but you’ll be happy to know that it’ll all be done far before we ship them out.</p>
<p>So send us your offerings and we’ll send you the nightmares.</p>
<p>Sincerly,</p>
<p>-Samuel Rhod</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Price Concerns</h3>You may be wondering why the price is so steep, but allow me to remedy your concerns. Obviously a 20 dollar price is quite expensive for a paperback book, but normally paperbacks run from 8-15 dollars. Count shipping and that's 13-20 dollars. We also have manufacturing costs because we are self publishing, so the things start to add up. One thing we hate to do is the 50 dollar price on the signed copies. The only issue with signing the books is that we live nowhere near each other. How we remedy this is we will have one author sign a ton of papers, send them to the next author, and go down the chain before landing at the final destination, where they will be inserted into the books. This will minimize shipping costs and keep us under budget.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/192381/files/20131112061856-bookbeatles.jpg?1384265936"" src="""" style=""width: 261.698px; height: 392px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/192386/files/20131112062137-BoaColor.jpg?1384266097"" src="""" style=""width: 268.674px; height: 392px;""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Our Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The challenges we face are somewhat daunting as they all boil down to you, the fans, to help push the bar up for us to get everything squared away and ready. The major challenge is balancing a fair price with a reasonable price. We would love it if we could make the items cheaper and more fair for you guys, but we have to account for shipping costs, production costs, and so much more. The cost may seem a bit high, but removing some for shipping and getting the book before anyone else will ever see it, I think that offsets it. </p>
<p>If the book is funded, another challenge will be actually creating some of the items from the higher tiers.

We always wanted to make a horror collection...
It was late in the evening. Christopher Earnings (DimensionBucket) got a message from his fellow writer and ""CreepyPasta"" narrator Josh Reeves (Awkward Thursdays.) He announced this idea he had, which involved taking the best writing they had, and collecting them into one huge anthology. Over the course of time, more stories were written, and other authors decided to join in. Here we are today, with a short story collection with over thirty horrifying tales of the macabre. Throughout the book, we are also including original artwork by Major Moose
We were really happy the way the book came out, and even more joyous when Mr. CreepyPasta, WellHey Productions, LitterBot, HauntingSeason, GentlemanWalrus, and many others agreed to record guest narrations for the audiobook. Now, you can hear the stories of ""Neighborhood Kids"" brought to life in audio form.
Anyhow, we're really excited to present our project to the world, and hope you're as excited as we are.



Our Goal

Hello Folks,

I’m Samuel Rhod. I’m here to tell you a little bit about this massive venture that we’re all putting together for you, the fans. We’ve painstakingly edited and written a collection of over thirty short horror stories for your pleasure. We’re very proud of what we have done and it’s a large undertaking so far. The group is facing some rather difficult odds and I know it seems like we’re asking for much. In truth we are doing what we can to keep your expenses down while making a small margin of profit to get you a copy of the book.
The group will be self publishing this book out to you, the fans, in various different forms. We’ll have several narrators reading for the audio book, including Murphy of WellHeyProductions and Josh from Haunting Season, a few other unconfirmed guests, and ourselves. Your funds will be used to power this well oiled machine in which will turn out the pages you will hold in your hands. We will then use the money left over to meet you all for a panel at Delta-H Con for a Theatre Obscurum panel where you can ask us all sorts of questions.
We are all proficient writers and we have had many others give us feedback on the stories with generally positive reviews. Between Geoffri C. Nelvon, Christopher Earnings, Josh Reeves, Jacob Emory, and myself we’re looking at a team of heavy hitters who’ll get the job done for you all. So far all of the stories are written and we are currently still editing a bit, but you’ll be happy to know that it’ll all be done far before we ship them out.
So send us your offerings and we’ll send you the nightmares.
Sincerly,
-Samuel Rhod


Price ConcernsYou may be wondering why the price is so steep, but allow me to remedy your concerns. Obviously a 20 dollar price is quite expensive for a paperback book, but normally paperbacks run from 8-15 dollars. Count shipping and that's 13-20 dollars. We also have manufacturing costs because we are self publishing, so the things start to add up. One thing we hate to do is the 50 dollar price on the signed copies. The only issue with signing the books is that we live nowhere near each other. How we remedy this is we will have one author sign a ton of papers, send them to the next author, and go down the chain before landing at the final destination, where they will be inserted into the books. This will minimize shipping costs and keep us under budget.



Our Challenges

The challenges we face are somewhat daunting as they all boil down to you, the fans, to help push the bar up for us to get everything squared away and ready. The major challenge is balancing a fair price with a reasonable price. We would love it if we could make the items cheaper and more fair for you guys, but we have to account for shipping costs, production costs, and so much more. The cost may seem a bit high, but removing some for shipping and getting the book before anyone else will ever see it, I think that offsets it. 
If the book is funded, another challenge will be actually creating some of the items from the higher tiers. We are dedicated to creating the best quality, so we are looking forward to making the props, box sets, and the book itself look as good as possible -- as well as the stories being as good as possible.

We will require appreciate an extra 10 dollars shipping to Canada (if it is a physical item, not digital) and 15 for anywhere else international.

<p>Hi guys and girls, grandpas and grandmas, men and women, kids and people who don't know where they fit! Welcome.</p>
<p>My name is Pedro and I'm a writer from the land of Portugal looking to self-publish his first book in English!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What's in it For You?</h3>
<ul><li><b>The safety of traveling</b></li></ul>
<p>A lot of people will tell you traveling is dangerous, especially when in countries like Iraq, Pakistan... especially when hitchhiking... especially when staying with locals anytime you can, especially... when anything! Well, it's not! As long as you have some social and emotional intelligence, in this book you understand how traveling isn't dangerous!</p>
<ul><li><b>Hitchhiking?<br/></b></li></ul>
<p>I'd never hitchhiked before this trip. It seemed like a strange concept and I'd never get far. I left Portugal and hitchhiked most of the way to Pakistan! In the end I did 20.000km this way. My main motivation was because it was free, it's true, but I soon realized it's such a cool way to meet random genuine people. Reading this book you can understand some of its tricks, please share yours with me when you start : )</p>
<ul><li><b>Inspiration</b></li></ul>
<p>I always feel awkward proclaiming it might inspire you, because after all, who am I, right? But turns, I'm just a guy. And people that are just people can inspire other people, as some other people inspired me. I think the way it can inspire you is by showing how easy it is once you take that decision to go, if that's what you want to do. I don't think everyone should travel, people should do whatever makes them happy. For me it's this, and who knows if by reading the steps I took to release myself from the shackles of normality you won't be closer yourself?...</p>
<ul><li><b>Traveling with little money?</b></li></ul>
<p>I spent 3300€ in 284 days, which is 11€ per day. A camera, insurance, meals, drinks, moving around... everything. I know you don't find 3300€ under a rock every day. But reading this book you can understand how I could do it with even less, since I'm not shy about explaining when I felt some expenses could be avoided.</p>

<h3>What Led Me On Such a Journey?<br/>
</h3>As someone who always loved traveling I once found myself in India in 2009 in one of those <b>I-gotta-do-what-I-gotta-do</b> moments and decided to <b>quit my job</b> as a psychologist in Birmingham, UK,and just go and <b>be happy</b>, figure out the rest as I went along. You know... I guess I simply realized that what I really, <i>really </i>wanted was to <b>travel</b>... and <b>write</b>.
<p>So I had to try.<br/></p>
<p>I traveled for 9 months and a half and at the time it was the <b>best thing I'd ever done</b> (since then I cycled from Portugal to South Africa) and what I felt and what I learned changed some parts of me.</p>
<p>I traveled through <b>34 countries</b>, hitchhiked 20.000km in 314 vehicles (green on the map), took the bus for another 20.000 (red) and the train for 10.000 (orange).</p>

<h3>What Then?<br/>
</h3>Once I was back I needed to take the next step - to <b>write </b>about all these experiences and <b>share</b> what I'd learned.<br/><br/><p>No longer wanting to be under some publisher's wing I decided to <b>print the book on my own</b>, in Portuguese. I was pretty sure it was gonna work and so I moved forward with the editing. And the first edition sold out in 3 months! It was incredible! I'd taken what I thought was a bold and perhaps risky move and it worked out!<br/></p>

<h3>What Now?</h3>
<p>Now I want to <b>publish this book in English</b>. Sure, there's a lot of people speaking Portuguese out there, but in English this book could reach so many more. People who want to travel themselves, people who want to travel vicariously, people who want to learn a bit the same way I did, friends of mine, like you, maybe, with whom I'd like to share something so important to me.</p>
<p><b>The book is already written!</b><br/></p>

<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>You know, I thought a lot about that... ""Why should anyone care about what I have to say?"" And I think it's just because I'm <b>someone who did something</b>. Not the best tagline to sell something, I know, but the truth is that <b>no one else has ever lived <i>exactly </i>what I lived those days.</b><br/></p>
<p>On top of that I consider myself to be someone invested in <b>breaking down prejudice</b> we have towards people that are not the same as us, someone who reflects on what's happened to him, someone attentive and willing to let all the kindness he receives land in his heart, <b>understanding we are all the same</b>.<br/></p>
<p>I believe this book and future ones might be <b>my best go at changing anything</b>. <br/></p>
<p>Finally, and judging from so many opinions that have been shared with me throughout time, <b>this book is an inspiring one</b>. It shows you that in order to break free you don't need much more than just wanting to do it. And once it shows you you can do it (if that's what you want, cos if you don't, that's cool too) it shows you some ways in which you can do it.</p>

</div></div>","What is

We're not just a publication that does features on local talent. We are the seen but unheard artists from Lancaster, PA. A collaboration of local talent to showcase local talent; those without money, connections or a desire to settle. The Townie is a platform for original essays, poems, short stories, photo galleries, videos, music and other mediums that tell the story of all of Lancaster's residents.

They tell us we're starving artists. We're not starving; we're hungry. Passionate creatives of every background and medium contribute their talents to showcase the hidden creativity in every corner of Lancaster city. We value our work and our community and don't acknowledge a choice between living with passion and just living.
Art for Art's (and Community's) Sake
As Townie's, we've taken on the mission to create art, create opportunities, and create a community of artists within which we create artistic opportunities for each other.
Though Lancaster's residents are primarily people of color (60%), they only comprise around 6% of the creative workforce in Lancaster City. With intentional content and hiring practices, The Townie seeks to provide creative opportunities and a publication reflective of our city's diverse make-up.
Readers will enjoy content and original works of art not available anywhere else in the world. Visitors to Lancaster reap the benefits of having a guide to the unseen. And Lancaster residents will gain exposure to a broader view of all of its neighbors.

<div>I am a fresh and freed-up individual intent on forging freedom for women who find themselves living life trapped, stuck, and in bondage.  Maybe it is a secret sin.  Maybe it is a painful past.  Maybe you live your life every day in fear.  Maybe you run yourself into the ground trying to make everything perfect.  Maybe you are just stuck in a rut.  I have a powerful life story, and through it I want to show you that the <b>FREEDOM</b> Christ died for is <b>REAL,</b> <b>AVAILABLE,</b> and <b>ATTAINABLE</b> for all of us. Through an authentic and transparent message, I will point to the truths found in scripture and prove how they are relevant today.  Whether it is speaking or writing, the message is clear, <b>FREEDOM IS WAITING</b>.<br/><br/>I lived in bondage to a secret past for more than 30 years.  My young life was wrought with abuse, sexual trauma, and human trafficking at the hands of those responsible for my well-being.  With the trauma came a myriad of coping mechanisms I used to survive and maintain some sense of sanity - eating disorders, self-harm, lying, running away, attempted suicide.</div>
<div>When I finally did escape, I moved away and started a new life.  I started a career, got married, met Jesus, had kids.  I had lots of friends, was PTO president, an IronMan triathlete, and super involved at church.  I could juggle all the balls and do it very well.  Everyone wanted the life that I had, or at least they thought they did. Inside I was lonely, scared, and trapped.</div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>pReservation32, Inc. began as the brainchild of Zane Lambert. In 2011, after returning from a road trip which took him through several American Indian Reservations, he noted a stark difference between the oral health care received by Native Americans on and off the Reservations. Zane decided that it was imperative he become involved with helping this segment of the American population. Unfortunately, after attempting to become a member of such an organization, he could not identify a non-profit group specifically focused on improving oral health care for Native Americans. As such, Zane began to mold and shape his own non-profit organization using the scope of the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pReservation32's mission is to ease the disparity of oral healthcare access, funding, and education to Native American populations on their Reservations by building charitable capital, making philanthropic grants, and more general: to preserve the vitality of these communities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through these contributions, we hope to purchase a mobile dental clinic and supplies. This clinic would be able to reach out to Native Americans on their Reservations with minimal effort to the patient and the dentist.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The great news is that 80% of the contributions will go directly to fund the mobile clinic. The remainder of these funds need to go to organizational operating costs such as business licenses, website fees, and office expenses. Per our organizational bylaws, at no time will the collected money pay an officer's salary. If our goal is not fully funded, the amount collected will be held in an interest bearing account until a new campaign can be launched.</p>
<p>We are in the process of finding a Native American artist to create one of a kind ""perks."" However, this task is proving to be much more difficult than originally anticipated. Therefore, the only perk we can offer at this time is a huge heartfelt thank you from our organization. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span>To give one a sense of urgency, a study was conducted at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The following statistics were pulled from that paper:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ninety two adults or 68 percent of the adult participants had evidence of gum disease and 16 percent showed signs of an advanced problem. Gum disease can lead to a loss of teeth and can put people at risk for other serious health problems like heart disease.</li>
<li>One child and five adults were found to have signs of a precancerous condition of the mouth. If left untreated, such a condition can progress to full-fledged cancer.</li>
<li>The high prevalence of decay and gum disease suggests that many participants had chronic pain that could interfere with daily activities.</li>
<li>About half the adults in the study had missing teeth and two had no teeth at all.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>We are reminded of the age old question; which came first? The chicken or the egg? Poor oral health has been directly linked to reduced GPA's and increased school absences. This in turn eventually leads to depressed household incomes and thereby directly oppressing future generations from obtaining good oral health and stellar grades in school. Help pReservation32 keep these kids excelling in school.</span></p>
<p><span><span>At pReservation32, we have heard the call to action and we are building our resources to respond to this crisis. However, in order to achieve any progress we must build capital. Please help us reach our first fundraising campaign goal.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot help financially, that doesn’t mean you cannot help:</p>
<p>You have friends who may not stumble upon this campaign. Please use Indeigogo share tools to get the word out that we are in need of initial funding. Thank you for reading and putting in the effort to spread the word.</p>
<p>If you are a Native American artist, or know of one, please contact us. We would love the opportunity to speak with you about creating ""perks"" for our organization.</p>

One child and five adults were found to have signs of a precancerous condition of the mouth. If left untreated, such a condition can progress to full-fledged cancer.
The high prevalence of decay and gum disease suggests that many participants had chronic pain that could interfere with daily activities.
About half the adults in the study had missing teeth and two had no teeth at all.

We are reminded of the age old question; which came first? The chicken or the egg? Poor oral health has been directly linked to reduced GPA's and increased school absences. This in turn eventually leads to depressed household incomes and thereby directly oppressing future generations from obtaining good oral health and stellar grades in school. Help pReservation32 keep these kids excelling in school.
At pReservation32, we have heard the call to action and we are building our resources to respond to this crisis. However, in order to achieve any progress we must build capital. Please help us reach our first fundraising campaign goal.

<p>Hi, I’m Mara Momsen. I have heard that our greatest challenges in life can be our greatest gifts. I am passionate about sharing my life lessons with other abuse survivors so they may recover with more ease, grace and less pain. I will share my journey, accumulated knowledge, exercises and wisdom to help others in the healing process.</p>
<p>You might be asking why my book is different from all the other self-help books. I offer a unique look into the physiology of abuse. I give the reader an understanding and insight into the mind and brain function of the abuse survivor. Knowledge is power. If we understand why we have certain behaviors it makes it that much easier to change them. Do you know every time you have a thought the body produces chemicals that are sent to every cell if your body within seconds. These are our emotions.</p>
<p>My book will stand out from the other self-help books because I am going to include a companion hypnotherapy CD. Each chapter will have a corresponding track that will help eliminate blockages and take the healing to a deeper level.  </p>
<p>The information I am sharing will help transform survivors into thrivers. We all deserve the chance to thrive. I am confident that I can help change the landscape of abuse recovery in this country. I need a platform to do this from and that platform is my book. Please help me fulfill my destiny.</p>
<p><strong>Why I need your help</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution will go directly to my book coach and nothing else. This is my first book and having guidance makes all the difference in the world. My coach has guided many people to the best sellers list and I want to be the next one. My target goal covers the cost of my book coach for six weeks. That is less than one third of my contract so anything over my target is very much appreciated. Actually, any contribution is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>I am determined to get this project done one way or another. Your help will make the next phase of the journey a little (a lot) easier. I am forever grateful; not only for myself but for all the lives you will help me touch.</p>
<p><strong>What will you get in return?</strong></p>
<p>I am just finishing a transformational phycology program at the Southwest Institute of the Healing Arts and learned some new healing modalities. I want to gift all who help me by helping you reach your goals and dreams. Life coaching helps you stay on track to reach you goals while hypnotherapy helps address any unconscious resistance. Toe reading is as fun as it is informative. You will be amazed at what your toes are trying to tell you. Stepping into your power hypnotherapy track will leave you feeling good about yourself. And you can share it with your friends if you want.</p>
<p><strong>Just a little more help : )</strong></p>

<p>
After an extensive search for writing on topics contained in this book, I
realized that for the most part, it doesn't exist, and should. Words like
‘abstract’ and ‘video’ are bandied about quite often in the art world without a
thorough examination of what these terms mean in relation to each other and how
they have changed over time. This book seeks to explore different instances and
aspects of abstraction in moving image artworks and to tell the story of the different ways the
abstract ‘means’ now in regards to the moving image. </p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>""Sidney and Vicky Dine around the World"" is a non-fiction picture book that explores table etiquette in various countries through the eyes of Sydney and Vicky- two eight year old friends.  Sydney is a book-worm who is constantly trying to gain more knowledge.  Vicky is a happy-go-lucky, adventurous girl, who possesses a special power.  The two friends embark on a magical journey around the world to discover different eating customs.  It has been written, revised, revamped, and tweaked with the authors paying attention to detail. Much love has been put into this book! The book is written in rhyming couplets utilizing a repetitive line that enables young children to join in with the chorus.  This book is the first book in our Around the World Series (5 more exciting titles are on the way!).  We have chosen to produce a limited edition author illustrated version of ""Sydney and Vicky Dine around the World"" for our Indiegogo family.  We are currently working to complete illustrations for the book and get it ready for self-publishing; although our ultimate goal is to find a publisher for our series- only our manuscripts will be submitted to publishers.</span></span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>What you will help us achieve:</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>You will help us get our book in the hands of children around the world; spreading knowledge and appreciation of a multicultural world to young learners.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>The Writers:</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Kristin Halligan is an educator and mother residing in Northern Thailand.  She holds a B.A. in Sociology and a Masters degree in International Education.  Kristin is a self acclaimed cultural anthropologist and travel enthusiast.  She is fluent in Thai and loves to explore culture through linguistics.  When Kristin has free time she enjoys writing children’s books, jogging, swimming, cooking with her family and playing with her animals.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Alana Fischer has been a lover of the arts all her life.  She grew up drawing, painting and sculpting.  Later in life she turned her interest to other forms of art such as drama, writing, and music.  She loves travel and has been exploring Asia while teaching English for the past three years.  Alana holds a B.A. in Philosophy and a B.F.A. In her spare time Alana loves studying up on vegan nutrition, practicing yoga, writing children’s books, and singing karaoke.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Funding</span></h3>
<p>We have decided that we would like to find a publisher for our series.  However, if we do not find a publisher in a specific amount of time, we will self publish.  While we look for a publisher we will be preparing the book for self publishing.  The money that we raise will cover the cost of producing our own illustrations and self publishing expenses. The contributions will also cover the expenses of hiring an editor to provide a general critique on the strengths and weaknesses of our book.  We will hire a line editor as well.  Any additional funds will be used for marketing. </p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>What You Get</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Choose from our many perk options:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Two collages of illustrations in e-poster format</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A cookbook highlighting our favorite recipes from around the world.  This cookbook includes vegetarian, non-vegetarian, vegan and raw vegan dishes.</span></p>

<p><span> </span></p></div>","Our campaign:
""Sidney and Vicky Dine around the World"" is a non-fiction picture book that explores table etiquette in various countries through the eyes of Sydney and Vicky- two eight year old friends.  Sydney is a book-worm who is constantly trying to gain more knowledge.  Vicky is a happy-go-lucky, adventurous girl, who possesses a special power.  The two friends embark on a magical journey around the world to discover different eating customs.  It has been written, revised, revamped, and tweaked with the authors paying attention to detail. Much love has been put into this book! The book is written in rhyming couplets utilizing a repetitive line that enables young children to join in with the chorus.  This book is the first book in our Around the World Series (5 more exciting titles are on the way!).  We have chosen to produce a limited edition author illustrated version of ""Sydney and Vicky Dine around the World"" for our Indiegogo family.  We are currently working to complete illustrations for the book and get it ready for self-publishing; although our ultimate goal is to find a publisher for our series- only our manuscripts will be submitted to publishers.
What you will help us achieve:
You will help us get our book in the hands of children around the world; spreading knowledge and appreciation of a multicultural world to young learners.
The Writers:
Kristin Halligan is an educator and mother residing in Northern Thailand.  She holds a B.A. in Sociology and a Masters degree in International Education.  Kristin is a self acclaimed cultural anthropologist and travel enthusiast.  She is fluent in Thai and loves to explore culture through linguistics.  When Kristin has free time she enjoys writing children’s books, jogging, swimming, cooking with her family and playing with her animals.  
Alana Fischer has been a lover of the arts all her life.  She grew up drawing, painting and sculpting.  Later in life she turned her interest to other forms of art such as drama, writing, and music.  She loves travel and has been exploring Asia while teaching English for the past three years.  Alana holds a B.A. in Philosophy and a B.F.A. In her spare time Alana loves studying up on vegan nutrition, practicing yoga, writing children’s books, and singing karaoke.
Funding
We have decided that we would like to find a publisher for our series.  However, if we do not find a publisher in a specific amount of time, we will self publish.  While we look for a publisher we will be preparing the book for self publishing.  The money that we raise will cover the cost of producing our own illustrations and self publishing expenses. The contributions will also cover the expenses of hiring an editor to provide a general critique on the strengths and weaknesses of our book.  We will hire a line editor as well.  Any additional funds will be used for marketing. 
What You Get
Choose from our many perk options:
Two collages of illustrations in e-poster format
A cookbook highlighting our favorite recipes from around the world.  This cookbook includes vegetarian, non-vegetarian, vegan and raw vegan dishes.
A coloring book based on the final illustrations from Sidney and Vicky Dine Around the World
Sidney and Vicky Dine Around the World in ebook format
Original artwork from the book
Original custom artwork of your favorite international meal

<p>How many of us have struggled with our self-image?  How many of us have found ourselves repeating the same negative and stifling thoughts, behaviors and outcomes?  All of us have, and it has affected our relationships, money, food, time or work.</p>
<p>As a life and business coach for the last 15 years, my passion has been to teach, reveal and ignite how we can take our lives back and feel a deep peace and contentment within.  </p>
<p>I have been asked for years to write a book and the idea always appealed to me, but I was always too busy coaching to dedicate the time to a book project. So instead, I would write articles when time allowed.  </p>
<p>Because balance creates health, I too had to tap into in my own creative dreams, constantly setting the example and inspiring my clients.  Still, I kept telling myself that one day I would write that book!</p>
<p>Over the years, I felt a growing need to help on a bigger scale. I have coached so many people burdened with anxiety, fear and stress, including a new wave of younger clients and realized things need to change for these kids.  I wasn't interested in public speaking, as the process of self-discovery is so personal and requires going within, asking the right questions, as well as taking time to listen and reflect. I thought, ""How can I reach more people effectively?""  Time to write the book!</p>
<p>As you can imagine, writing a book requires time and focus.  I'm still trying to coach to pay the bills, but hunkering down to make this happen is what's important.  I'm collaborating with Indiegogo.com to help me write this book in months, rather than waiting for a publishing house to get it printed and to the shelves that could take years.  </p>
<p>Self-publishing the book will take a lot of hard work, financial investment and marketing on my part, but it's in my hands and I can get it out there with your help!  If you choose to help me with this crowd-funding experience, I want you to feel valued and inspired.  With a contribution, of course you will receive the book with the option of choosing a digital edition or the physical book.  </p>
<p>Another way that I will give back to you is by offering my unique ""one liners"" that I often spout out in a session or on Facebook.  My clients love them and I wanted to share them with everyone. So I've partnered with a professional graphic designer to create sets of limited edition quotation art that you can receive for higher contributions to my project.  </p>
<p>You have the option to choose from one or more professionally printed pieces. We have created a Zen series, a Contemporary art series and a groovy Mod series that are all fabulous!  You can gift them, hang them in your home or office or use them as a screen saver.  They remind us to be great!  Please take a look at the different pledge opportunities, as there are several ways to contribute.  You can be sure I will give back and stay connected with you throughout the process.</p>
<p>I think it's important for all people to have access to the tools to create a healthy life. For the many who cannot afford a one-on-one coaching session, they will now have the opportunity to buy or be given the gift of a personal workbook that allows them to go within and take their life back.  If we can have awareness and clarity about how we happened, then we certainly need the action and tools to course correct.  ""Know Thyself"" gives us just that.  </p>
<p><strong>Are you ready to take your life back?</strong></p>

How many of us have struggled with our self-image?  How many of us have found ourselves repeating the same negative and stifling thoughts, behaviors and outcomes?  All of us have, and it has affected our relationships, money, food, time or work.
As a life and business coach for the last 15 years, my passion has been to teach, reveal and ignite how we can take our lives back and feel a deep peace and contentment within.  
I have been asked for years to write a book and the idea always appealed to me, but I was always too busy coaching to dedicate the time to a book project. So instead, I would write articles when time allowed.  
Because balance creates health, I too had to tap into in my own creative dreams, constantly setting the example and inspiring my clients.  Still, I kept telling myself that one day I would write that book!
Over the years, I felt a growing need to help on a bigger scale. I have coached so many people burdened with anxiety, fear and stress, including a new wave of younger clients and realized things need to change for these kids.  I wasn't interested in public speaking, as the process of self-discovery is so personal and requires going within, asking the right questions, as well as taking time to listen and reflect. I thought, ""How can I reach more people effectively?""  Time to write the book!
As you can imagine, writing a book requires time and focus.  I'm still trying to coach to pay the bills, but hunkering down to make this happen is what's important.  I'm collaborating with Indiegogo.com to help me write this book in months, rather than waiting for a publishing house to get it printed and to the shelves that could take years.  
Self-publishing the book will take a lot of hard work, financial investment and marketing on my part, but it's in my hands and I can get it out there with your help!  If you choose to help me with this crowd-funding experience, I want you to feel valued and inspired.  With a contribution, of course you will receive the book with the option of choosing a digital edition or the physical book.  
Another way that I will give back to you is by offering my unique ""one liners"" that I often spout out in a session or on Facebook.  My clients love them and I wanted to share them with everyone. So I've partnered with a professional graphic designer to create sets of limited edition quotation art that you can receive for higher contributions to my project.  
You have the option to choose from one or more professionally printed pieces. We have created a Zen series, a Contemporary art series and a groovy Mod series that are all fabulous!  You can gift them, hang them in your home or office or use them as a screen saver.  They remind us to be great!  Please take a look at the different pledge opportunities, as there are several ways to contribute.  You can be sure I will give back and stay connected with you throughout the process.
I think it's important for all people to have access to the tools to create a healthy life. For the many who cannot afford a one-on-one coaching session, they will now have the opportunity to buy or be given the gift of a personal workbook that allows them to go within and take their life back.  If we can have awareness and clarity about how we happened, then we certainly need the action and tools to course correct.  ""Know Thyself"" gives us just that.  
Are you ready to take your life back?

The Perks

The Contemporary Set:

""Imagine the dynamic that is uniquely you. What do you result in?""
""Your relationship with yourself determines your relationship with everything. Pretty cool, huh?""
""Thinking about the things we want rewires the brain and gives us instant excitement. Can you feel it?""

The Mod Set:

""Stop talking yourself out of what's next.""
""Your dream is where passion is ignited.""
""Redesign your experience on your terms.""

The Zen Set:

""Life is not happening to you. You are not the leaf blowing in the wind. You are the tree. Stand tall.""
""Don't expect others to behave in order for you to have a good time. Just decide to have a good time.""
""Emotions are our compass. If we listen, they can save us from pain. Listen more. Run, talk, spend less.""

<p>We are a group of five people hoping to get justice, not just for ourselves but for a host of others whose names are, as yet, unknown to us and may never be known, but they will get justice too. If we win.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It started with me, which is why I am the one writing the story, but we are all equally involved we all have the same story.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Last summer I entered what seemed to be a legit writing competition. Novels were to be submitted. It stated in the rules that they had to previously unpublished.  I received an email about it, after clicking on a link on a social networking site. I had an almost finished MS and  it was 2 months till the deadline, I finished the novel, edited it, and entered it. The first prize was a publishing contract. I never expected to win and guess what, I never heard back, so I figured I hadn’t made the cut. Fair enough.  It ought to be mentioned that the competition appeared to be endorsed by a celebrity (although looking back at it the name had been spelled slightly wrong. I admit, I never noticed at the time)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I decided to self-publish, until a friend of mine, impatient to see the book told me she had found it already on Amazon. Naturally, I told her she was wrong, I had not got around to it yet, but I took a look anyway. She was right. It was my book. The title was the same, but the author name was different. It was a slightly mangled version of my own name and it had been published by a small publishing firm. I looked at their website and my book was on sale there too. Along with a few others. Just a few I might add – maybe 10 or 12. Not very many.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I then did a title search and found it for sale on other sites too, all with the same mangled version of my name and all apparently from the same small publishing firm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I contacted them and was told the book was their property now and to drop it or risk being sued. I also received a pretty snotty email purportedly from a solicitor warning me not to publish the book myself as it no longer belonged to me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I suppose I could have left it at that, but I didn’t see why I should. I was pretty sure what they were doing was illegal and it occurred to me that the only people who had had access to my book were the one’s running that competition. The name was different, but it seemed logical. I then started to think that maybe I wasn’t the only one.</p>
<p>I searched for the other authors, using keywords from the titles of the other novels on the site, the author names (I tried a few permutations of their names, remembering how my own name had been slightly changed as the author name -  an example would be Alice instead of Alicia or Mark for Marcus) and from the synopses of the books. I was hoping to come across social networking accounts or writing blogs that mentioned the books and would give me a way to contact the real authors. It was a long shot, but it actually worked. I found someone. Their blog was all about a book they were hoping to publish, never realising that it already had been without their permission. They too had entered the bogus competition.  To cut a long story short, between us we found 3 other victims of this scam and we know there are more out there who have no idea. We haven’t given up hope of finding them, but even if we don’t, we intend to get justice for them all. But with 5 of us all with the same story, we have now got a pretty good case to present.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our lawyer thinks so too, but that doesn’t mean he is willing to represent us for free.</p>
<p>If we want to litigate we need funds. But you knew that, why else would we be telling our story here?</p>
<p>At $100 an hour legal representation does not come cheap – even splitting the costs between us. We also need money to file suit in the first place. We can probably scrape that up – but without the money to pay the piper, there would be no point.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this point the firm who scammed us is still out there doing the same thing to others, and selling books they have no right to sell, and until we take them on legally we can’t even name and shame them in case of a slander suit against us. They have no idea we are planning to take this to court . I hope it comes as a huge shock to them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The nitty gritty – we have been told that it will cost up to and maybe a little over $20,000 to bring these weasels to justice and make them pay up. I am sure that is why they believe they can get away with it. Not many people have that kind of money lying around – we certainly don’t But it isn’t even about the money for us. We just want our books back. I want the right to publish my own book that I worked hard on – that’s what we all want.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are aiming this campaign at $5,000 to get us started. With that we can file suit and give our lawyer a retainer to get the party started. We know this might well be a long hard fight, it might even be a losing fight in the end, but we are determined to see it through. We stand together.</p>
<p>Any money that does not get used in the lawsuit will be used to set up a foundation and website to help other indie authors who find themselves in this situation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please help us see that these unscrupulous people do not get away with stealing our work and that of others.</p>

In 1981 I was a 16 year young junior at Norristown High School, in Norristown, Pennsylvania. I had dreams of going to college, playing football and if lucky, making it to the NFL.I thought my life was great until on one tragic night in December of 1981, at a friend's party, I fell out of a 2nd floor window, suffering a broken neck.For the last 30 years I've been living at home being taken care of by my mother. My mother has been here doing everything for me from the very beginning.She has literally made me her life. She washes me, feeds me, and exercises me. You name it, my (single parent) mother does it. The way we currently travel is by car. We require help by a family member or friend and the two become my personal lift.With the car not being wheelchair accessible, it really is a task lifting, bending and maneuvering my body in and out of the car. Well, with 30 years gone by, we both are older and I'm much heavier. It is really becoming a burden on my 66-year-old mother to constantly lift me.After all she has done for me, I would love to be able to tell her, ""Mom, we have a brand new wheelchair van!!!""If there are folks out there who have it in their power to help my mother and me, we both would really appreciate it.

<h1>Without hesitation, I will say, <strong>""This book just might change everything.""</strong>
</h1>
<p><strong>105,000</strong>.  Search ""leadership"" on Amazon and that's what you'll get in your results.  So the big question is why the heck does the world need another book about leadership?</p>
<p>Simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>This book doesn't exist yet.</li>
<li>Short and right to the point, for leaders who don't have a lot of  time to read.</li>
<li>This book is honest and candid, including my own failures and successes.</li>
<li>Young leaders need a fresh approach.</li>
<li>Too many leaders are selfish</li>
<li>Teenagers a dying for something authentic and straightforward(that isn't a ""teen version"" of an adult book).</li>
<li>Young adults are bored with the same 10 leadership books.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Leadership is something I love studying. For the past 20 years, I've watched and learned from people leading me, authors writing on the subject, and speakers teaching about leadership. It's in my blood. I've read countless books, listened to countless speeches, watched countless men and women lead groups that I've been a part of.</span></h3>
<p>I am, without question, convinced  that I am on to something fresh and new with this book. This just might change everything.</p>
<h1>The timeline: </h1>
<div>
<p>8/29- send final text to editor</p>
<p>9/7- review prototypes of cover art</p>
<p>9/14- rewrite portions according to editor's recommendations</p>

<p>9/21- receive final cover art from designer</p>

</div>
<p>I am a full time professional motivational speaker to students across the country. This is my second book. In Sept, 2011, I self-published Jigsaw(The Past, Present and Future Me) and have moved around a thousand copies thus far.</p>
<p>What will these funds be used for? Offsetting the costs involved with EDITING, DESIGNING,LAYOUT and PRINTING.</p>
<p>*If we SURPASS our goal: (these costs DON'T include the production costs) The cost to print 1,000 copies is $1800. 2,000 copies is $2300 and 3K copies is $2800. I would LOVE to print as many copies as possible. The more we bring in, the more we can print. The cheaper they are to print, the more I can GIVE AWAY to young people who can't afford them.</p>

<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p></div>","Without hesitation, I will say, ""This book just might change everything.""

105,000.  Search ""leadership"" on Amazon and that's what you'll get in your results.  So the big question is why the heck does the world need another book about leadership?
Simple:

This book doesn't exist yet.
Short and right to the point, for leaders who don't have a lot of  time to read.
This book is honest and candid, including my own failures and successes.
Young leaders need a fresh approach.
Too many leaders are selfish
Teenagers a dying for something authentic and straightforward(that isn't a ""teen version"" of an adult book).
Young adults are bored with the same 10 leadership books.

Leadership is something I love studying. For the past 20 years, I've watched and learned from people leading me, authors writing on the subject, and speakers teaching about leadership. It's in my blood. I've read countless books, listened to countless speeches, watched countless men and women lead groups that I've been a part of.
I am, without question, convinced  that I am on to something fresh and new with this book. This just might change everything.
The timeline: 

8/29- send final text to editor
9/7- review prototypes of cover art
9/14- rewrite portions according to editor's recommendations
9/21- send final text to layout designer in Michigan
9/21- receive final cover art from designer
9/28- send final layout of book to printer
10/20- receive and review mock-up of book
11/10- receive first shipment of book
11/14- mail out YOUR copie(s) of book

I am a full time professional motivational speaker to students across the country. This is my second book. In Sept, 2011, I self-published Jigsaw(The Past, Present and Future Me) and have moved around a thousand copies thus far.
What will these funds be used for? Offsetting the costs involved with EDITING, DESIGNING,LAYOUT and PRINTING.
*If we SURPASS our goal: (these costs DON'T include the production costs) The cost to print 1,000 copies is $1800. 2,000 copies is $2300 and 3K copies is $2800. I would LOVE to print as many copies as possible. The more we bring in, the more we can print. The cheaper they are to print, the more I can GIVE AWAY to young people who can't afford them.

<p><strong>JOURNEY TO THE HEART OF THE WORLD</strong>  will be an engaging Young Adult fantasy novel based on a true story.  Christian Castagno is a teenager living in New York when his mother dies of cancer. She leaves behind an illustrated handwritten letter, written when he was conceived, describing the life adventures that await him. Chris tells the story of being led by a talking butterfly, in a series of what may or may not have been dreams, to a mystical mountain in South America where he meets a wise teacher, the elder of a lost tribe of indigenous peoples who fled the coast at the time of Columbus - a people who believe themselves to be the Heart of the World. The spiritual and environmental teachings of the shamanic elder trigger several dream-like heroic adventures through Chris’s past and future lives, including being present as the Spanish conquistadors land on the Colombian coast and participating in conversations between Thomas Edison  and Henry Ford. In the end, the hero comes to understand the true purpose of life and the prescription for saving the life of his endangered Earth Mother.</p>

<p><em>John Lundin with the Mamos of La Sierra Nevada</em></p>
<p>I am the author of THE NEW MANDALA - Eastern Wisdom for Western Living, written in collaboration with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, a book that presented the message of the Buddha to western readers. I have recently been invited by the elders - the Mamos - of the indigenous descendants of the Tairona of the Sierra Nevada in Colombia - people who fled the Spanish invasion in the 1500s and whose culture has remain largely unchanged for five hundred years - to live with them and to learn from them and to write a book that will share their urgent message, the message that our Earth Mother is in trouble and that we are the only ones who can save her.</p>
<p>I have chosen to write a young adult fantasy novel, not unlike Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings or The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, one that will appeal to young adult readers since they are planet's only hope for the future. It will not be a ""preachy"" book, but it will be an engaging fantasy adventure story with a serious message, one that young people will want to read and one that parents and teachers will encourage them to read.</p>

<p><strong>SCOPE OF THE PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>I am currently living in Colombia, in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, receiving sacred teachings from the shamanic elders, the Mamos, of the Kogi, the Arhuaco, the Wiwa and the Cankuamo, ancient peoples who have not changed their ways since fleeing the Spanish invasion five hundred years ago. I have been invited to live among them, to experience their culture and to learn from them. They are very suspicious of outsiders, but they know their Earth Mother is in danger of dying unless we, whom they refer to as their Young Brother, change our ways. They have asked me to listen to their plea and to write a book that will convey their urgent spiritual and environmental message to the world. This will not be a book <strong><em>about</em></strong> these profoundly spiritual people, but instead it will be a book that allows the reader to experience their message – a book that will engage the reader’s imagination in a manner that touches the heart.  It will be a book that can change young lives, and ultimately change the world.</p>

<p>This book project requires a great deal of travel, for visits with the indigenous elders in their secluded villages and for research in general. I am currently living in Minca, an eco-village in the foothills of La Sierra Nevada, just above the coastal city of Santa Marta.  The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is a unique pyramid-shaped mountain range adjacent to, but not geologically related to, the Andes. From its base at sea level the mountains rise to an altitude of 18,000 feet in just 24 miles. La Sierra contains areas of most every micro-climate on the planet, from beaches and deserts to tropical rain forest and coastal jungle to snow-capped glacial peaks. It is also one of the most bio-diverse regions in the world. The indigenous peoples have villages scattered throughout the Sierra, and move from village to village to cultivate their crops according to the altitude and changes of seasons, and to perform their Earth-saving spiritual and environmental rituals.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/552772_2815652604876_1665670263_1816898_250453960_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Travel to these secluded villages requires lengthy and arduous trips that include the hiring of off-road vehicles and drivers, and even mules and pack animals. On each of these trips I also bring food and supplies to the villagers. In addition to learning from the indigenous elders in their villages, my research for the book includes visits with local environmentalists, anthropologists, botanists and zoologists and ornithologists, and background research at various museums and conservation areas as well as to the sacred sites of the indigenous peoples. I am also employing professional translators to assist with my conversations with the indigenous peoples, and also to produce a Spanish language version of the book to be published simultaneously with the English version. The goal of this campaign is to raise $15,000, enough to cover these travel expenses for the next year of the research and writing that I anticipate will be required for completion of the book.</p>

ABOUT THE AUTHOR – JOHN LUNDIN

John Lundin with the Mamos of La Sierra Nevada
I am the author of THE NEW MANDALA - Eastern Wisdom for Western Living, written in collaboration with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, a book that presented the message of the Buddha to western readers. I have recently been invited by the elders - the Mamos - of the indigenous descendants of the Tairona of the Sierra Nevada in Colombia - people who fled the Spanish invasion in the 1500s and whose culture has remain largely unchanged for five hundred years - to live with them and to learn from them and to write a book that will share their urgent message, the message that our Earth Mother is in trouble and that we are the only ones who can save her.
I have chosen to write a young adult fantasy novel, not unlike Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings or The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, one that will appeal to young adult readers since they are planet's only hope for the future. It will not be a ""preachy"" book, but it will be an engaging fantasy adventure story with a serious message, one that young people will want to read and one that parents and teachers will encourage them to read.

JOURNEY TO THE HEART OF THE WORLD - When a teenager from the Catskills is led by a talking butterfly to the mountain home of a lost tribe in the jungles of South America, the elders’ sacred teachings initiate dream-like adventures through his past and future lives, revealing the secrets of their spiritual and environmental message – and the purpose of life.

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
I am currently living in Colombia, in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, receiving sacred teachings from the shamanic elders, the Mamos, of the Kogi, the Arhuaco, the Wiwa and the Cankuamo, ancient peoples who have not changed their ways since fleeing the Spanish invasion five hundred years ago. I have been invited to live among them, to experience their culture and to learn from them. They are very suspicious of outsiders, but they know their Earth Mother is in danger of dying unless we, whom they refer to as their Young Brother, change our ways. They have asked me to listen to their plea and to write a book that will convey their urgent spiritual and environmental message to the world. This will not be a book about these profoundly spiritual people, but instead it will be a book that allows the reader to experience their message – a book that will engage the reader’s imagination in a manner that touches the heart.  It will be a book that can change young lives, and ultimately change the world.
WHAT WILL THE SUPPORT FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR?

This book project requires a great deal of travel, for visits with the indigenous elders in their secluded villages and for research in general. I am currently living in Minca, an eco-village in the foothills of La Sierra Nevada, just above the coastal city of Santa Marta.  The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is a unique pyramid-shaped mountain range adjacent to, but not geologically related to, the Andes. From its base at sea level the mountains rise to an altitude of 18,000 feet in just 24 miles. La Sierra contains areas of most every micro-climate on the planet, from beaches and deserts to tropical rain forest and coastal jungle to snow-capped glacial peaks. It is also one of the most bio-diverse regions in the world. The indigenous peoples have villages scattered throughout the Sierra, and move from village to village to cultivate their crops according to the altitude and changes of seasons, and to perform their Earth-saving spiritual and environmental rituals.

Travel to these secluded villages requires lengthy and arduous trips that include the hiring of off-road vehicles and drivers, and even mules and pack animals. On each of these trips I also bring food and supplies to the villagers. In addition to learning from the indigenous elders in their villages, my research for the book includes visits with local environmentalists, anthropologists, botanists and zoologists and ornithologists, and background research at various museums and conservation areas as well as to the sacred sites of the indigenous peoples. I am also employing professional translators to assist with my conversations with the indigenous peoples, and also to produce a Spanish language version of the book to be published simultaneously with the English version. The goal of this campaign is to raise $15,000, enough to cover these travel expenses for the next year of the research and writing that I anticipate will be required for completion of the book.

HOW DOES THE SUPPORT PROGRAM WORK?
The goal is to enlist Supporters who will pledge a small monthly support contribution of $10.00 in the form of a monthly Subscription, billed to your debit or credit card automactically each month.  One hundred subscribers will provide $1,000 per month,enoughto fund the travel and other expenses necessary tocomplete the research and writing of the book. You can  Subscribe easily and securely on my website, www.JohnLundin.com.

<h3><strong>Did you know know that the publishing industry is changing so much that 99% of a publisher's budget is going toward those few titles that come from megaselling authors?  </strong></h3>

<h3>My Book Needs Your Help...</h3>
<p>My book <em>Friendships Don't Just Happen! The Guide to Creating a Meaningful Circle of Girlfriends </em>is already available for pre-order on Amazon.com and will be released on Feb. 12, 2013 by Turner Publishing.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the book is the first of its kind to offer a look at how we can create healthy platonic relationships around us in ways that support our lives.  It's not about how to meet more people, but rather about how to turn friendly people into friends that matter.  And while part of that process is about healthy expectations and appropriate steps toward bonding, much of it is about our own personal and spiritual growth. Relationships are the gymnasiums where we learn to stretch our compassion, increase vulnerability and trust, work through our fears about rejection, practice forgiveness, and let go of the need to judge others. </p>
<p>I was so happy when my editor wrote, ""The manuscript is awesome, by the way, and I think you've done an excellent job with flow, cohesiveness, tone, clarity of thought, and engagement. We're excited to get it to our reps! I'm thrilled to have had the privilege to be involved with this, and you've done such an impressive job in creating an honest, compelling, and helpful tool for every woman in your audience—no matter her age or life stage.""</p>
<h3>I feel confident that $10,000 can go a long ways to making these things happen.</h3>
<p>Book marketing budgets run the gamut so it's hard to know exactly how much is necessary, but I'm going to shoot for the lowest dollar amount I think I need to get the biggest bang for my buck.  No one person can do it all so I've carefully put together a marketing plan that I believe plays to my strengths: experience on TV, skills with teaching and speaking, and access to my target market through the GirlFriendCircles.com community.</p>
<p>To maximize those advantages-- I need money to ensure I can create a web site for the book that will be a resource for the media, make short videos for people to share on Facebook, hire a publicist to pitch TV shows, schedule events in cities where I have a following, run contests to increase the involvement of my community, and get my book in the hands of bloggers, critics, and editors across this country.</p>
<p>And all of that costs extra money that I don't have.</p>
<p>Just one book signing event in New York City will cost me a minimum of $2,000 for travel, lodging, publicity support prior to my visit to land me as much media attention while I'm there, and any VIP events I need to throw for my fans who help sell copies of my books. That number greatly multiplies when we add Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, just as a start to my book tour.</p>
<p>Obviously the more books I sell, the more opportunities I will have to speak, travel, and be interviewed on the themes of this book.  And these topics will help inspire the rebuilding of the social fabric of our country in ways that we desperately need in this day and age.</p>
<h3>Would you be willing to help this girl who refuses to be average, who has a passion to make a difference, and who has a plan to help spread the message of community, belonging, forgiveness, love, and acceptance to more people in our country?</h3>

<h3>The Fine Print:</h3>
<p><strong>If I Receive More Money:</strong><strong>  </strong>If I get more than $10,000-- I will be able to add other cities onto the book tour, each costing less since they won't have to be book launch premieres.  I'll be able to help pay for some administrative support which will keep increasing as I start to get emails from readers.  I'll be able to put together some extra resources that I can make available on my web site-- worksheets, checklists, and workbooks.  I'll also be able to host some Friendship Accelerator weekends in various cities, underwriting some of the costs.  I can use all the money that comes in, I assure you!  :)</p>
<p><strong>If I Receive Less Money:</strong><strong>  </strong>Well the good news is that even $2,000 will help since any amount I get will ensure I do one more event, one more project, one more strategy than I would have been able to do on my own.  So no money is wasted. However, as extra incentive, this crowd-funding site will take a 9% fee instead of a 4% fee if we don't reach the stated goal. So I'll cross my fingers we can reach that magic number of $10,000.</p>

<h4> </h4>
<p>Hi, my name is Dr. Bill.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've been writing children's stories for quite some time for my nieces and nephews. When Piranha Yama's story popped into my mind, I felt strongly that Yama's journey and it's messages would resonate in a bigger way and for more than just my family. I wanted to share it with everyone who loves colorful, fun, creative, uplifting, inspiring, adventurous, feel good stories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I enjoy telling stories that sprout up from the unique way my brain processes words, showing new dimensions of meaning while the subconscious enjoys the layers beneath. In this case, it’s appeared as a story about a yoga-loving Piranha on a terrific journey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As someone who is strongly empathetic, I feel or connect to others emotions by default, which is why I love doing things that help keep kids happy. And, in reality, we are all still kids with some years and layers of life experience built on top of us. With the positive messages that lace this story line, the happy “feel good now” side of us is reminded to shine bright and make the world a happier place.</p>
<h4> </h4>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4> </h4>
<p><b>What is Pranayama? </b></p>
<p>It is a style of yogic or meditative breathing. The breathing technique is known to increase communication between the hemispheres of the brain, energize and heal the body, and oxygenate and alkalize the blood, amongst other things.

<p><b>Who Is Piranha Yama?</b></p>
<p>Piranha Yama is a loveable and powerful character that is learning to get into the flow of life's journey. Her life seems perfect on the outside, but she has her own personal obstacles to overcome.</p>

<p><b>What will we learn through Yama's stories? </b></p>
<p>I want to tell you the whole story of Piranha Yama, but it’s more fun with the imagery and in a book format. I don’t want to give too much away either, but I can tell you this...</p>
<p>Yama reminds us to trust your instincts, to listen to wise elders, to stick up for yourself, to have courage to do new things, to calm your mind, to move your body, to breathe, to realize your boundaries are only real until you surpass them, to go with or against the flow, the importance of listening to your dreams, and to know that things will be okay (even when you feel lost). </p>
<p>I hope you will all begin this adventure with Yama and share the encouraging message “The light within guide your fins.”</p>

</div></div>","Hi, my name is Dr. Bill.
 
 
I've been writing children's stories for quite some time for my nieces and nephews. When Piranha Yama's story popped into my mind, I felt strongly that Yama's journey and it's messages would resonate in a bigger way and for more than just my family. I wanted to share it with everyone who loves colorful, fun, creative, uplifting, inspiring, adventurous, feel good stories.
 
I enjoy telling stories that sprout up from the unique way my brain processes words, showing new dimensions of meaning while the subconscious enjoys the layers beneath. In this case, it’s appeared as a story about a yoga-loving Piranha on a terrific journey.
 
 
As someone who is strongly empathetic, I feel or connect to others emotions by default, which is why I love doing things that help keep kids happy. And, in reality, we are all still kids with some years and layers of life experience built on top of us. With the positive messages that lace this story line, the happy “feel good now” side of us is reminded to shine bright and make the world a happier place.
 
 
 
 
What is Pranayama? 
It is a style of yogic or meditative breathing. The breathing technique is known to increase communication between the hemispheres of the brain, energize and heal the body, and oxygenate and alkalize the blood, amongst other things. The character, Yama, popped into my head as Piranha Yama because it sounded similar to the yogic breathing system.
 
                                         
 
 
Who Is Piranha Yama?
Piranha Yama is a loveable and powerful character that is learning to get into the flow of life's journey. Her life seems perfect on the outside, but she has her own personal obstacles to overcome.
 
 
                                           
 
 
 
 
What will we learn through Yama's stories? 
I want to tell you the whole story of Piranha Yama, but it’s more fun with the imagery and in a book format. I don’t want to give too much away either, but I can tell you this...
Yama reminds us to trust your instincts, to listen to wise elders, to stick up for yourself, to have courage to do new things, to calm your mind, to move your body, to breathe, to realize your boundaries are only real until you surpass them, to go with or against the flow, the importance of listening to your dreams, and to know that things will be okay (even when you feel lost). 
I hope you will all begin this adventure with Yama and share the encouraging message “The light within guide your fins.”
 
 
                              
          
Piranha Yama meets her teacher, Piranha One, in the dreamworld.
 
 
 
 
 
Who is the illustrator?
When I began thinking about Yama, I sketched her out on a piece of paper and excitedly showed my friends and family. However, judging from their reactions to my hieroglyphs, I quickly started my search for a real artist to bring Yama to life. I found the amazing artist and illustrator, Nikki Manteen, @HeySheDraws, based in Maryland. Take a look at the images and try to guess which one came from the trained artist.
 
   
 
 
How many adventures does Yama go on?
The story is a three book series with an exciting story arc. But for now, I'm going to start with ""Piranha Yama: The Art of Non-Biting"" and continue once the goals are reached for the first book.

<p><strong><em>Yari Yari Ntoaso: Continuing the Dialogue </em>is a symposium of literature by women of African descent taking place in Accra, Ghana, May 16-19, 2013.</strong>  This <em>free </em>gathering will put writers, critics, and readers from across Africa, the USA, Europe, and the Caribbean in dialogue with each other through readings, roundtables, screenings, and performances. <strong><em>YYN </em>continues the dialogue of the first two Yari Yari conferences, which put hundreds of writers in dialogue with thousands of readers.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Why should you give?</strong></h2>
<p>Amazingly, more than 50 poets, writers, and scholars from 15 countries have agreed to attend <em>and </em>to raise their own travel costs.  But those with less resources - often <strong>writers living in the Global South and those working outside of universities - are struggling to raise their travel funds.  The monies raised on this website will help cover these writers' costs.  Your gifts help ensure that <em>Yari Yari Ntoaso </em>will feature a wide range of voices.  </strong>If there are remaining funds, they will pay for documentation and an improved website so those who can’t attend in person can stay updated online.</p>

<h2>What is This Magazine?</h2>
<p>For more than 46 years, <em>This Magazine</em> has been publishing the voices, issues and topics mainstream corporate media ignores. From its early days as<em> This</em> <em>Magazine is About Schools</em>, the magazine has grown to be Canada's leading progressive magazine of politics, arts and culture. The magazine is home to award-winning investigative journalism, in-depth coverage of Canadian arts and culture and new work by the best emerging and established talent.</p>
<p><em>This Magazine</em> regularly publishes stories about politics, the environment, social justice, labour, aboriginal peoples, human rights, feminism and queer issues because we believe they're important. But they're not the kind of topics (Kate Middleton Unsolicited Uterus Update! Please Your Man Tips! Monkey Wears Kicky Jacket to Local Ikea!) that commerical media and magazines build their big business on.</p>
<p>Nobody owns <em>This Magagzine</em>. We don`t rely on advertising or corporate sponsorship. We run a tight ship with low overhead and an operating budget that's smaller than what most mainstream magazines spend on a single issue.</p>
<p>We may not have a big bottom line, but what we do have is freedom. Our writers can tell the stories they want, in the way they want to. Since 1966, <em>This</em> <em>Magazine</em> has brought Canadians thousands of important stories that counter the status quo, expose wrongdoing and expand the debate of issues that matter to you. This important work hasn`t gone unnoticed. In 2008, <em>This</em> <em>Magazine</em> was named one of the 20 most influential Canadian magazines of all time. <em>This Magazine</em> has been named Small Magazine of the Year by the Canadian Society of Magazine Editors three years running, received more than 75 National Magazine Award nominations, been a five-time winner at the Canadian Newsstand Awards and been nominated for Utne Independent Press Awards. People like us! They really do!</p>
<p><em>This Magazine</em> gives you an uncompromising, uncensored, unapologetic magazine with real people and real politics that have a daily impact on you, your family, your world. And now we want to give you more of this.</p>
<h2>What do we need?</h2>
<p><em>This Magazine</em> currently publishes six issues a year. This year we're launching a special project (a seventh issue) devoted to the stories you missed this year. These are stories that matter. Stories big media ignored, overlooked or didn`t delve deep enough into.</p>
<p>Newsstands are crowded with year in review issues, but this isn't your standard year in review coverage. There will be no best hook-ups and break-ups of 2012. We don't care what's hot or not hot! No newsmakers, trendsetters or one's to watch. You will not see the words ""baby bump"" anywhere. We promise! No best movies of 2012! Worst movies of 2012! Movies you should have seen in 2012, but didn't!</p>
<p>What you will find are stories about rights, the people and places that don't have them, but should. These are the stories you need to read. Stories about the lawsuits companies are using to muzzle environmental activists. A report on that other B.C. pipeline. An investigation of Nunavut's suicide crisis. You'll find all these stories, and more, in our first-ever Year in Review issue.</p>
<p>But, we need your help to finish this issue. We need to raise $3,500 by December 25 (we can report your good deeds to Santa right up until midnight on the 25th) to get our Year in Review issue into readers hands. Your donations will support a group of dedicated writers, journalists, illustrators and photographers who are more interested in real analysis and real issues than corporate ass-kissing, breakneck news cycles and sound bites.</p>
<p>Your donation will help cover the printing, production and editorial costs of our special Year in Review issue. Take a break from holiday shopping and holiday movie marathons (I refuse to watch <em>Love Actually</em> one more time!) and donate now.</p>
<p>As a thank you for your support we've got lots of great gifts available. All donations are also tax-deductible!</p>
<p>Help us reach our goal of $3,500. Help <em>This Magazine</em> publish it's first annual Year in Review issue and provide a national forum for the people, issues and opinions big media ignores.</p>
<p>We can't thank you enough for donating,</p>
<p><em>This Magazine</em></p>
<p>PS: Please help us spread the word about our campaign. Tell your friends! Get on Facebook and Twitter now and help us promote the heck out of our campaign. Cute cat videos can wait and the Ikea monkey's tweets will still be relevant for at least another 11 minutes. Thank you!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>POSTRmagazine: published since 2009</p>
<p><span style=""font-style: italic;""><br/>“If you consider the great journalists in history, you don’t see too many objective journalists on that list. H.L. Mencken was not objective. Mike Royko, who just died. I.F. Stone was not objective. Mark Twain was not objective. I don’t quite understand this worship of objectivity in journalism.”</span></p>

<br/>POSTRmagazine is a quarterly magazine, written in English that is printed on an A1 size poster and available for free in Europe in selected concept stores, shops, art centers, galleries and concert halls. We currently have a printing run of 5000 copies per issue. The choice for the A1 size is because we want to look at different possibilities of magazine publishing, use of public space and freedom of speech.<br/>POSTRmagazine is an independent Counter-Culture magazine in tradition of the Free Press magazines and newspapers from the 1960s and 1970s. Every issue of POSTRmagazines talks about one specific subject and consists of an editorial, main story, two side stories and an interview with two experts on that subject.<br/>POSTRmagazine is not a lifestyle magazine, a mud slinging machine or a haven for conspiracy theories. Our influences are Rolling Stone magazine, Oz, the International Times and the Berkeley Barb.<br/>The content of POSTRmagazine is critical and subjective. We pay homage 
to Gonzo journalism and the New Journalism but don't want to copy these 
styles in any way. POSTRmagazine has it's own, modern style of writing 
which is critical and subjective. Our content is always fact-based 
though and the result of thorough research. Our readers are invited and 
even provoced to think for themselves rather than us telling them what 
to think.<br/><br/>Pieter De Kegel is the publisher and designer of the magazine. He's a graphic designer with his own studio called Not Another Graphic Designer and he's been an art director for different magazine since 2005. Pieter works together with Robbert Van Jaarsveld and Michael De Wilde (aka Monkeys With Typewriters) who are two top notch journalists to write the articles in POSTRmagazine. Next to our editors in chief we have one more contributor called Bart Deweer who helped start the Belgian branch of Vice magazine. Evelyne Copers is Pieter's fiance and she takes care of administration and distribution.<br/><br/>We finance POSTRmagazine with 1 advertisement on the back of the A1 poster and small logos of people who support us on the front of the poster.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want your help to keep publishing this great, independent magazine. We have been making POSTRmagazine for two and a half years now but it's getting increasingly hard to finance the writing and printing costs of the magazine with the advertisement on the back. <br/>There's a lot of blood sweat and tears that go into making POSTRmagazine and we insist on paying our writers and contributors for the work they put into writing their fantastic articles. Printing the magazine is expensive as it is now but we want to increase our printing run to 10000 copies so it wil become even more expensive in the future. We don't want to become dependent on advertisers so we can keep our content 100% non-commercial. Getting the money we need will allow us to use our back cover for illustrations or photography. This will enhance the overall quality of POSTRmagazine even more.</p>

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<h3>
<strong>Good News Toronto</strong> </h3>
<p>Eva Karpati has been sharing her passion for good news and Toronto as founder and chief editor of <em>Good News Toronto</em> in print since its original inception in February 2008. It’s amazing what a fresh perspective can do! Not only does it brighten someone’s day, but over time it changes the way we see and interact with the world around us<em>. <a href=""http://www.goodnewstoronto.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>Good News Toronto</em> </a></em>reveals the vibrant communities that are often hidden from mainstream print, thereby allowing people to connect with all the wonderful individuals and their projects in Toronto. The community is not only engaged by the stories they read but also through direct involvement in the paper. The newspaper has become an important source for mentoring talented individuals, from professional writers to journalism students to visual artists and poets. In print for over four years, Good News Toronto<em> </em>needs your support to continue its evolution!</p>
<p><em>Good News Toronto</em> is run by a loyal, talented group of volunteers who create and share this free publication throughout Toronto. With a circulation of 10,000 each month distributed in 640 locations the paper costs $3000 per issue to print. That’s $36,000 for an entire year of print, and this only represents a small portion of the potential readership that deserves a greater dose of good news. These challenges will be conquered once the new digital magazine is made easily accessible to everyone online! </p>
<h3><strong>The Seeds of Hope Foundation </strong></h3>
<p>Founder David Walsh and executive director Kimberly Curry have committed their organization to helping Toronto’s most vulnerable.<em> Seeds of Hope</em> is a charitable organization that provides places of hope and belonging for those at a crossroads in their lives. Places where people find their gifts and abilities through communities of compassion and caring. The transitional homes, safe places, and creative spaces enhance livelihood, learning, and social opportunities. In 2010<em> </em><em><a href=""http://www.seedsofhope.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>The Seeds of Hope Foundation</em></a><em> </em></em>touched the lives of over 3,000 people, through transitional housing placements, Learning Centre Activities and more than 25,000 community meals.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Cause for Good</strong> </h3>
<p>Ileana Rouse, Mark Kearney, Emery Bishop and their team at <em><a href=""http://www.causeforgood.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cause for Good</a> </em>recognize unprecedented opportunities and potential for <strong>good to lead </strong>in our world. They decided to dedicate their lives and enterprises in a mission to serve humanity and the planet. The goal is to leverage the amazing changes and opportunities recognized to create an abundant world (that is prosperity beyond sustainability). This cannot be done alone, so we are very glad to have great partners and friends to work along side on this purpose.

Who We Are

Good News Toronto 
Eva Karpati has been sharing her passion for good news and Toronto as founder and chief editor of Good News Toronto in print since its original inception in February 2008. It’s amazing what a fresh perspective can do! Not only does it brighten someone’s day, but over time it changes the way we see and interact with the world around us. Good News Toronto reveals the vibrant communities that are often hidden from mainstream print, thereby allowing people to connect with all the wonderful individuals and their projects in Toronto. The community is not only engaged by the stories they read but also through direct involvement in the paper. The newspaper has become an important source for mentoring talented individuals, from professional writers to journalism students to visual artists and poets. In print for over four years, Good News Toronto needs your support to continue its evolution!
Good News Toronto is run by a loyal, talented group of volunteers who create and share this free publication throughout Toronto. With a circulation of 10,000 each month distributed in 640 locations the paper costs $3000 per issue to print. That’s $36,000 for an entire year of print, and this only represents a small portion of the potential readership that deserves a greater dose of good news. These challenges will be conquered once the new digital magazine is made easily accessible to everyone online! 
The Seeds of Hope Foundation 
Founder David Walsh and executive director Kimberly Curry have committed their organization to helping Toronto’s most vulnerable. Seeds of Hope is a charitable organization that provides places of hope and belonging for those at a crossroads in their lives. Places where people find their gifts and abilities through communities of compassion and caring. The transitional homes, safe places, and creative spaces enhance livelihood, learning, and social opportunities. In 2010 The Seeds of Hope Foundation touched the lives of over 3,000 people, through transitional housing placements, Learning Centre Activities and more than 25,000 community meals.

Cause for Good 
Ileana Rouse, Mark Kearney, Emery Bishop and their team at Cause for Good recognize unprecedented opportunities and potential for good to lead in our world. They decided to dedicate their lives and enterprises in a mission to serve humanity and the planet. The goal is to leverage the amazing changes and opportunities recognized to create an abundant world (that is prosperity beyond sustainability). This cannot be done alone, so we are very glad to have great partners and friends to work along side on this purpose. With your help, Cause for Good is helping GOOD NEWS Magazine to launch.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p>Hello-</p>
<p>My name is Evan
Lemke and I am an activist for Planned Parenthood Votes North West. As a member
I work towards equality for both men and women and to politically motivate the
community in support of sexual right. Working on the ground floor you may see
me canvasing the neighborhood creating awareness or tabling community events.
Believing in something isn’t a daydream for me; I put it into action and create
change.</p>
<p>My work as a
leader in change does not stop with Planned Parenthood. I am also the President
of the Human Development club for Washington State University Vancouver and a
Court Appointed Special Advocate for Clark County. As I am working towards a
degree in Human Development I strive to make a positive impact on my society.</p>
<p>Recently I have
been given an opportunity to travel to Washington DC and participate in
becoming a leader in change for Planned Parenthood Generation Action Network. A
team that brings in advocates for reproductive freedom and specialize in
creating lasting changes in the community that surrounds them. Upon my arrival
to Washington DC I will be trained as a political leader, gain valuable
knowledge in the political field, and network with some of Washington’s top
ranking leaders. By donating today you will be supporting a loyal activist in
the fight for reproductive freedom for all. </p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Sonny grew up in Chester, PA. When he was 12 years old, his father passed away prematurely. “I became a man on July 21, 1994, the day my father died,” Pinkney says.

<p>“My illness and near-death experience has changed my perspective on life.

<li>My name is Mark Blackburn, I am a father, a son and a passionate illustrator/designer and writer.</li>
<li>This campaign is to fund, print and self publish 300 high quality copies of my first children's book.

</ul><h3>The book itself</h3><ul><li>The title “TODAY I AM"" refers to each page containing an illustration of a child playing in a onesie/costume of a different animal, alongside short verse relating somewhat to the type of animal and it’s nature, but also to the changeability of a child’s mood and their desire to explore, play and imagine.

<li>IT'S NORMAL TO HAVE OFF DAYS, IMPERFECTION IS FINE</li>
<li>DON'T WORRY SO MUCH WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK.</li>
<li>I have attempted to inject a sense of irreverence, goofiness and fun into these pages, but there is an underlying, positive message in there too.</li>
<li> I have drawn and written in quite a few subtle cultural references, Easter eggs if you like. Nods to other literary works, movies, songs, footwear, toys, elements which are close to my own heart. If adults especially, spot these, I think they'll recognise their origins.</li>
<li>I have a keen interest in natural history which is reflected in some of the animal species I've drawn; a few of which are slightly obscure and would hopefully encourage the reader to investigate these further.</li>
</ul><h3>Challenges Ahead</h3><p>Once I manage to produce the initial run of books, I will use 100 copies as promotional tools and approach publishers and retailers, online influencers, plus arrange talks and demos at schools and festivals to help push the project on, and develop it into a series with further expansion and marketing potential. I already have 2 follow up books in the pipeline.</p><p>I would love to be able to send a copy of the final book to every person who helps towards making it, but in reality getting the first 300 made is really only the beginning.<br/>Anyone who contributes to this venture, I would hope very much that they would be willing to go on the journey with me to see how far we can push this project. So share, blog, tweet and like it and shout about it into becoming a not only a successful book, but encourage the spread of it's positive message, allowing kids to express themselves and be whatever they like on any given day.<br/> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you cannot or do not want to contribute financially to this campaign, I would welcome any pertinent advice or ideas as how I can take this concept further, tips or experiences you might have had with similar projects in order to help me get it out into the wide world.</p><p>Please share and post or blog and tweet about this project/fund on social media, I'm sure your friends would like to hear about it, if they have children or not.</p><p> Indiegogo share tools are one way of helping spread the word about TODAY I AM</p></div>","'Today I Am'

I have attempted to inject a sense of irreverence, goofiness and fun into these pages, but there is an underlying, positive message in there too.
 I have drawn and written in quite a few subtle cultural references, Easter eggs if you like. Nods to other literary works, movies, songs, footwear, toys, elements which are close to my own heart. If adults especially, spot these, I think they'll recognise their origins.
I have a keen interest in natural history which is reflected in some of the animal species I've drawn; a few of which are slightly obscure and would hopefully encourage the reader to investigate these further.
Challenges AheadOnce I manage to produce the initial run of books, I will use 100 copies as promotional tools and approach publishers and retailers, online influencers, plus arrange talks and demos at schools and festivals to help push the project on, and develop it into a series with further expansion and marketing potential. I already have 2 follow up books in the pipeline.I would love to be able to send a copy of the final book to every person who helps towards making it, but in reality getting the first 300 made is really only the beginning.Anyone who contributes to this venture, I would hope very much that they would be willing to go on the journey with me to see how far we can push this project. So share, blog, tweet and like it and shout about it into becoming a not only a successful book, but encourage the spread of it's positive message, allowing kids to express themselves and be whatever they like on any given day. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you cannot or do not want to contribute financially to this campaign, I would welcome any pertinent advice or ideas as how I can take this concept further, tips or experiences you might have had with similar projects in order to help me get it out into the wide world.Please share and post or blog and tweet about this project/fund on social media, I'm sure your friends would like to hear about it, if they have children or not. Indiegogo share tools are one way of helping spread the word about TODAY I AM",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello I'm Squeak. I am in need of some assistance. I run Pony In A Box Productions. I love to create the audioplays that I, with my wonderful team of people, have been creating since 2011, Doctor Whooves Adventures, Goodnight's Journals, Daring Do Adventures and the coming Mare Do Well Adventures. But do to economic stress unexpected vet bills, student expenses and general misfortune (Which you may no as 'Murphy Attacking', I may not be able to devote as much time to my projects as I have these past two years. If you can, I really need your help. I would like to use the time these donations would buy me to make something awesome, a Doctor Whooves Storyline, Traveler. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need some help in order to keep writing and doing the things I love, I'd like to meet the goal of 2k, but any bit helps.

I can't hope to get the stories I have in production finished in a timely manner if this economic pressure stays on my head. I will still work with Ponyinabox of course, I simply will not be able to devote as much time to the show or its fans. If you help to give me this time, I will do my best to bring one of my most requested stories to life. </p>
<p>And because I am asking your help, there are perks. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>Welcome to the IndieGoGo page for Authors, Large and Small! We are a full-service literary public relations firm, offering online and offline publicity to authors of all genres, self and traditionally published. </p>
<p>We interview authors and write press releases, solicit blog and Amazon reviews, land bookstore signings and media interviews, and consult regarding how to develop and maintain social media presence, and assist with formal book proposals and queries. </p>
<p>We have years of experience, and a solid track record of scoring results for an eclectic crowd of writers. Endorsements and more information are available at our regular website, <a href=""http://authorslargeandsmall.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://authorslargeandsmall.wordpress.com</a></p>
<p>We are profitable and sustainable financially, just seeking a temporary infusion of cash to spread our values and business model through some strategic advertising. </p>
<p>Our business is green and eco-friendly, as we all telecommute, reducing air pollution, and send most of our documents and books out as e-copies to save paper. </p>
<p>We also provide work, references, training, experience and an income source for our team members, many of whom are disabled, terminally ill and uninsured, single parents, recent graduates, recovering from homelessness or addiction, or residents of developing countries. </p>
<p>We operate through revenue-sharing, where half of what a client pays us will go to a team member in need of flexible work opportunities. Our people are perfectly capable of working and very talented, just need coaching and the chance to set their own schedules. Just because someone cannot show up in a cubicle from 8-7 pm daily, dressed in polished work clothes, in one of the world's major cities, should not mean that the literary industry cannot use their talents!</p>
<p>We seek to empower a broad, diverse group of people through work, education, and income, preserve the environment and our financial resources, and infuse new energy into the publishing and writing fields. </p>
<p>We are an established company with eight people currently working with us, tackling publicity matters for 32 books. This is more of a sales pitch than a fundraising site, but IndieGoGo lets us accept credit cards for free and easily expand our offerings. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would like to attend the three-day San Francisco Writers' Conference, and let the professional authors there know about Authors, Large and Small. What we have to offer them is cheaper and more flexible and comprehensive than similar services they will find elsewhere, so this is a good set of potential clients. One of our current repeat clients came from the SFWC when I attended as a volunteer five years ago. </p>
<p>Conference costs $575 if we sign up before Sept 1st, and we're asking for a little over twice that. Our team members who are offering the perks will receive half of whatever you pay us, since our whole business model works through revenue sharing. </p>
<p>The remainder of what we raise/earn goes to our leadership for personal income (we're starving artists too!) and to other promotional needs (recycled-paper business cards, bus and train fare, food for our author events, etc). </p>
<p>We'll complete the list of perks/items for sale as time goes on and our staff and team members decide what they have to offer. </p>
<p>But for now we're offering commentary and advice on your resume, cover letter and/or book query letter, from one of our team members who's quite experienced in providing these services on a freelance basis. </p>
<p>Also, two of our team members, highly experienced writers with amazing stories to tell, will provide inspirational poetry. </p>
<p>Our regular literary public relations services are also available here, for their regular prices. These include creating press releases for your work, soliciting blog and Amazon reviews, organizing bookstore signings, landing you media interviews, and consulting regarding social media. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project seeks to spread the ideas of Authors, Large and Small to the broader literary world. We've been successful so far within our circle of self-published and small-press authors and indie bookstores and bloggers, but we would like to expand our sphere of influence. </p>
<p>We believe our business model is more humane, eco-friendly and resilient in the face of economic and technical changes. So, we would like to educate people about our ideas for the broader benefit of the literary and publishing industries, as well as to earn money for our team. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you have a blog, and are interested in reviewing books, or would like to mention independent and small press books on your Facebook and Twitter accounts, please contact us at <a href=""mailto:cedeptula@sbcglobal.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cedeptula@sbcglobal.net</a> with Book Review Blogger in the subject line. We are happy to send you free books from a whole variety of genres. </p>

<p>Thank you very much. </p></div>","Welcome to the IndieGoGo page for Authors, Large and Small! We are a full-service literary public relations firm, offering online and offline publicity to authors of all genres, self and traditionally published. 
We interview authors and write press releases, solicit blog and Amazon reviews, land bookstore signings and media interviews, and consult regarding how to develop and maintain social media presence, and assist with formal book proposals and queries. 
We have years of experience, and a solid track record of scoring results for an eclectic crowd of writers. Endorsements and more information are available at our regular website, http://authorslargeandsmall.wordpress.com
We are profitable and sustainable financially, just seeking a temporary infusion of cash to spread our values and business model through some strategic advertising. 
Our business is green and eco-friendly, as we all telecommute, reducing air pollution, and send most of our documents and books out as e-copies to save paper. 
We also provide work, references, training, experience and an income source for our team members, many of whom are disabled, terminally ill and uninsured, single parents, recent graduates, recovering from homelessness or addiction, or residents of developing countries. 
We operate through revenue-sharing, where half of what a client pays us will go to a team member in need of flexible work opportunities. Our people are perfectly capable of working and very talented, just need coaching and the chance to set their own schedules. Just because someone cannot show up in a cubicle from 8-7 pm daily, dressed in polished work clothes, in one of the world's major cities, should not mean that the literary industry cannot use their talents!
We seek to empower a broad, diverse group of people through work, education, and income, preserve the environment and our financial resources, and infuse new energy into the publishing and writing fields. 
We are an established company with eight people currently working with us, tackling publicity matters for 32 books. This is more of a sales pitch than a fundraising site, but IndieGoGo lets us accept credit cards for free and easily expand our offerings. 


What We Need & What You Get
We would like to attend the three-day San Francisco Writers' Conference, and let the professional authors there know about Authors, Large and Small. What we have to offer them is cheaper and more flexible and comprehensive than similar services they will find elsewhere, so this is a good set of potential clients. One of our current repeat clients came from the SFWC when I attended as a volunteer five years ago. 
Conference costs $575 if we sign up before Sept 1st, and we're asking for a little over twice that. Our team members who are offering the perks will receive half of whatever you pay us, since our whole business model works through revenue sharing. 
The remainder of what we raise/earn goes to our leadership for personal income (we're starving artists too!) and to other promotional needs (recycled-paper business cards, bus and train fare, food for our author events, etc). 
We'll complete the list of perks/items for sale as time goes on and our staff and team members decide what they have to offer. 
But for now we're offering commentary and advice on your resume, cover letter and/or book query letter, from one of our team members who's quite experienced in providing these services on a freelance basis. 
Also, two of our team members, highly experienced writers with amazing stories to tell, will provide inspirational poetry. 
Our regular literary public relations services are also available here, for their regular prices. These include creating press releases for your work, soliciting blog and Amazon reviews, organizing bookstore signings, landing you media interviews, and consulting regarding social media. 


The Impact
This project seeks to spread the ideas of Authors, Large and Small to the broader literary world. We've been successful so far within our circle of self-published and small-press authors and indie bookstores and bloggers, but we would like to expand our sphere of influence. 
We believe our business model is more humane, eco-friendly and resilient in the face of economic and technical changes. So, we would like to educate people about our ideas for the broader benefit of the literary and publishing industries, as well as to earn money for our team. 


Other Ways You Can Help
If you have a blog, and are interested in reviewing books, or would like to mention independent and small press books on your Facebook and Twitter accounts, please contact us at cedeptula@sbcglobal.net with Book Review Blogger in the subject line. We are happy to send you free books from a whole variety of genres. 
Please get the word out and make some noise about this campaign, online and offline. And remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!

<p>Dear Universal Family,</p>
<p>Since I was a little girl, I've known I've always wanted to be a writer. As many of you know I’ve been working on my book, “Be A Thriving Artist, Not A Starving Artist (How To Manifest Your Artistic Dreams Without Struggling)”, and I am now ready to give birth.</p>
<p>In order for me to get to the next level, I could really use your support. Here is how you can help my dream become a reality.</p>
<p>The first phase of this process is to achieve my goal to raise $12,000 dollars or more in 35 days or less. <strong><em>Something to ponder- “Life is short. God’s way of encouraging a bit of focus.” Robert Brault </em></strong> </p>
<p>The second phase would be to use the contributions to create several new websites, purchase a new laptop, Microsoft Office, McAfee antivirus software, and get professional photos. I would need the services of proof readers and editors. The actual, physical birthing of the book cover, layout and printing the book. Any remaining money left, I would use that for P. R. /marketing and moving the book forward. I am on third base and I need a couple of pushes to get me to home plate or, better, on the New York Times Bestsellers list.</p>
<p>I could really use your support!! Will you help me by donating to my campaign on <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/cleopatra"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.indiegogo.com/cleopatra</a>?

<p>Finally, remember, as God moves me forward in creating massive success for others and myself, I will never forget your act of generosity toward something I believe in. Please let me know if there’s anything I can ever do to help you move through your life with ease, grace, and a whole bunch a fun. I wish you the best in this moment and beyond.</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Two years ago, I started work on this book. It had started out as an idea that popped into my brain and it was a joke, more than anything else. Y'know: ""Wouldn't it be funny if...?""</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I get myself into more trouble asking my brain these kinds of questions, because my brain inevitably starts answering the questions and tacking on other ideas and saying to itself, 'oh, but what if -- and what if --? oh, and what if this happened at this point here?!'.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Before I knew it, I had enough material for a whole book -- hell, a whole <em>series</em> of books -- and my brain refused to let me forget it or set it aside. The ideas that refuse to die are the ones you have to get down on paper otherwise they'll haunt you forever, so I bit the bullet and said to myself - okay, if The Idea is still around by the time NanoWrimo comes around this year, I'll start work on it.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">November came around and, wonder of wonders, The Idea was still camped out on my couch, drinking all my good coffee and waiting for me to quit dicking around and start writing, already.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">So, I started work and fixated on the daily word counts, the weekly word counts, and surprising myself with how easy it was to develop a strong work ethic when it came to my writing. I not only finished and reached the 50,000 word goal, I finished with several days to spare.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I told myself as soon as November was up and NanoWrimo was over, I'd give myself a month's break and then start working on editing what I'd written and then finish up with the first book.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">But then real life happened and my day job ate my life and all my free time and energy along with it. Let's face it - my day job might have paid the bills, but it's never been what I've wanted to do with my life. I've been writing since I was 12 years old and whenever I told anyone about my dream of becoming a published author, they would always tell me 'you won't make a penny' (usually with a pinched, almost apologetic expression on their faces, like 'oh, <em>hon</em>!') and I'd always say, with all the passion of a frantic compulsive, 'I don't care, I just want to <em><strong>write</strong></em>'.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The money has never mattered to me, but the longer I go on, the more I realized my day job would never reward me in the way my writing does. But at the end of the day, after toiling away for hours at my job, I just didn't have the energy or the kind of focus it takes in order to write.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I need time and I need help -- not just to finish the first book, but to get it professionally edited and proofread, to get pretty, pretty cover art created for it and, finally, get it out there for people to read. The Idea is like the bastard child of Godzilla and Frankenstein's Monster: it's not content with being stuck in my skull, it wants to get out and throw the furniture around in <em>your</em> house and drink up all of <em>your</em> good coffee!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About The Idea:</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">With this book, I want to show you vampires in a way you've never seen them before. Years of reading and research are going into the making of this book, but my mission statement from the very beginning has been to take back the vampire genre from writers like Stephenie Meyer. Stephenie claims she was never a fan of vampire novels or movies and, quite frankly, it shows. I want to write a vampire novel for people who know vampires and know they don't sparkle like diamonds in the sun. I want to write a vampire novel for people who love Bram Stoker, for people who saw <em>The Lost Boys</em> in theaters when it first came out and then wore out their VHS copies watching it over and over again, just like I did.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">This is a book for people who love vampires, like I always have, and who are dismayed at the involuntary trendy, safe, fang- and blood-free YA-friendly makeover these creatures of the night have gotten in the last 5 or 10 years. This isn't a YA series - make no mistake, it most definitely <strong><em>will</em></strong> feature mature content - but it's going to be asking a lot of mature questions, too: about faith, about grief and guilt, about the nature of mortality and time, about memory and about devotion.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </p>
<p><strong>About the Campaign:</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">So this is where you come in. Your donations will help to fund the completion of my book and help me be able to afford to have it professionally edited and proofread. While that's being done, I'll be looking for an artist to do my cover art and I'll be researching options for print copies, though at this time, my primary focus is e-reader formats. With luck, if enough people donate, I'll be able to release the book in e-book formats as well as print and make those available at various levels to the donors.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">One of the perks I'm especially excited about is going to be for a select few donors for the book - if you donate a certain amount, you'll not only be getting your copy of the finished book well before it's released to the world at large, but you'll also have the opportunity to meet up with your fellow donors on Skype to have an advance book release Q&amp;A session with me! You'll get the opportunity to give me your feedback about the book as well as ask any questions that you might have. I <em>love</em> hearing from my readers and really look forward to chatting with the donors for this particular perk!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I have to admit, I'm also really excited to see if anyone will go for the Four Poster Bed perk, though I'm more excited about the idea of getting to tattoo your names all over me -- to show that not only is my dream well on its way to coming true, but so I can proudly show off those tattoos and say 'these people helped me make this happen'.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Any money that comes in over the goal will go towards making the book and artwork even cooler than what I already have in mind! <br/><br/>From the start, I had it in mind to crowdsource the completion and eventual release of this book because, to be quite honest, I don't think a professional triple-A publishing house would know what to <em>do</em> with it. And, what can I say, I'm a control freak -- I want to release the book I'm <em><strong>actually writing</strong></em>, not the book big publishing houses are convinced will <em><strong>sell</strong></em>. You guys will know if this book, this story and these characters are for you and, over the coming days/weeks, I'll be sharing more and more of the details about the book with you right here!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">If you want to see The Idea get loosed on an unsuspecting public who think the Cullens are the end-all and be-all of vampire fiction, like I do, then throw some cash my way and help me give the current status quo of the genre the mother of all wedgies.</p></div>","About The Writer:

Throughout the story, she evolves from someone who is seen as a chess piece to be moved, to someone who kicks butt and takes names. Her character is all about redefining what people think the role of a princess should be.<br/><br/>My name is Khadijah L. Wynter and I am the author of The Mafia Princess. I wrote this book to showcase a strong female protagonist that doesn’t need anyone to save her and actively goes against the traditional “princess” role. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a strong, relatable character. You will see that not all princesses follow the typical “Disney-style” mold that says they need someone — usually a man — to save them. A real princess takes control of her own story.<br/>You will love this book if you enjoy modern stories about the mafia, strong female protagonists, and narratives that reject traditional stereotypes. The Mafia Princess speaks to women and a young adult audience who value a strong female protagonist with agency, and want to see more stories that challenge the “damsel in distress” narrative you typically see in princess stories — they want to see a princess who rescues herself!<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that The Mafia Princess inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions and statements like:</p><p>Why do traditional princess narratives position the princess waiting to be saved, as if she doesn’t have agency otherwise?</p><p>Can the definition of a “princess” be flexible and go against tradition? </p><p>How do you become your own hero and not rely on someone else?</p><p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing the dynamics of the princess narrative and becoming your own hero will change us all for the better. </p><h3><strong><u>Summary of My Book</u></strong></h3><p>“In the Mafia lifestyle, you never know when your last day alive will be. Walking down the street with your guard down can lead to you on the side of the road choking on your own blood. Usually over something your employer did, and your murderer will kill you just to send them a message. Betraying the wrong family can lead to one bullet to the head and two to the chest if you are lucky. If you’re not lucky, well, you could spend the last few days of your life stuck in a basement being tortured just for your limbs to be sent to your family piece by piece, with your family hoping they have all the pieces of your body before the day of your funeral. Such are the risks you take in our business. While the men are praised for their heroics, the women are forced to shut up, look pretty, and shop like the airheads their husbands want them to be. Being trained to pull the trigger as a woman is relatively unheard of. This leads to Mafia wives and daughters — ‘princesses’ — being utterly defenseless. That’s not the life I wanted to live, my destiny is bigger than this.<br/><br/>“I, Angelica Ferrari, was destined to be more. I won’t let the barriers my father thinks I should abide by keeping me down. I don’t abide by the rules these old-timers set for me. Nor should I take the abuse my father is determined to dish out to have me stay compliant to him. I clutch my gun and sheath my blades every morning before leaving my loft. I may be a princess, but I’m not a Disney princess. As far as I’m concerned, a real princess gets off her ass and gets shit done. I’ve done tons of jobs with the benefit of my family in mind. I’ve never needed some man to swoop in and save me like a damsel in distress and I find no need to have one now. <br/><br/>“But when my father’s loyalty and intentions come into question, and my brother Leonardo turns up missing, the only person I can possibly turn to is a guy from another Mafia family: Cristian Salvatore, the heir to the Salvatore throne. But when Cristian finds himself in a sticky situation, it looks like the only person to rescue the men that I need the most is me. You know what they say, real women kick ass.""</p><h3>
<br/><strong><u>The Book - The Mafia Princess</u></strong>
</h3><p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><u><strong>Part 1</strong></u> contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. Readers are introduced to the main character, Angelica Ferrari, and are shown a glimpse of the current situation she finds herself in. It also introduces the secondary character, Cristian Salvatore, and his notorious family as well. <br/><br/><u><strong>Part 2 </strong></u>contains chapters 4-10. Here the reader is given a taste of Angelica’s determination to write her own story and be her own hero. Of course, nothing comes easy, so we watch the internal and external battle that Angelica has to go through to be who she is determined to be. Also, how Angelica reacts when on the verge of losing everything and everyone she loves.<br/><br/><u><strong>Part 3</strong></u> contains chapters 11-Epilogue. These chapters brings Angelica’s story to a close and show us the decision she makes after all that’s happened. Will she choose the family she was born into, or the newfound family she has found along the way?</p><h3><u><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></u></h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3>Join the Revolution.</h3>
<p>The Living Stone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is a dark time for the land of men.</p>
<p>After centuries of corruption and war, the elven Empire of Kryus has conquered and colonized the nations of men, oppressing humanity into a false peace and suppressing the truth of who they once were.</p>
<p>And so men have lost the way.</p>
<p>Caleb De’Ador – a man who knows the truth and trained by the elves – returns to his homeland. Haunted by prophecy and his own past, Caleb’s purpose is to raise an army of believers and teach humanity how to be free again.</p>
<p>But before this revolution begins, Caleb must reach the Living Stone.</p>
<p>At the same time, a long forgotten evil is unleashed, threatening to throw all living beings into an even greater darkness. A young woman, Eshlyn, takes on the task of warning her people and keeping her son safe.</p>
<p>____________________________________</p>

<p>Hello! I am MB Mooney, author of a new fantasy novel entitled The Living Stone. While I've been writing stories since the 2nd grade, this is the first novel I'll be self publishing.</p>
<p>The first book in a series entitled the Eres Chronicles, the Living Stone has been described as a mix between LOTR, Narnia, and Game of Thrones. In other words, it is a story focused on character, story, and action; it possesses Christian allegory and parallels; but it is a dark, violent and more modern story. This makes it a unique book.</p>
<p>People have also really enjoyed reading it!</p>
<p>I've been working on this book for over 3 years: the idea, the characters, building the world and history, and the plot. After finishing the first draft and two major revisions, it is almost ready to publish ... but I need your help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$5000 of your help.</p>
<p>Good Lord. Why all that money?</p>
<p>First of all, like all professional books, it needs a good professional edit, which is an expensive endeavor. And since I am self-publishing, that money comes from me ... or you and me.</p>
<p>Second, some extra funds would help make the overall product look and feel more professional: graphics, cover art, website, etc. Many of these things I could do, but a little extra fundage would help with those things, too.</p>
<p>Oh, and there also needs to be some money to produce and ship the awesome rewards you get. Check 'em out.</p>
<p>Since the primary reason for this is to raise money for a professional edit, that will take time to get back, make corrections, etc, so that is why the target date for getting your ""perks"" seems so far away! The plan is to have this done by May, but I'm giving myself some wiggle room here.</p>
<p>And remember, the more money I raise, the better quality those perks will be!</p>
</div>
<div>If I make the goal, then you will be part of launching a great book and making it more accessible to the masses. If I don't make the goal ... well, I get to put out what I can and do it barebones.</div>

The Living Stone.
 
It is a dark time for the land of men.
After centuries of corruption and war, the elven Empire of Kryus has conquered and colonized the nations of men, oppressing humanity into a false peace and suppressing the truth of who they once were.
And so men have lost the way.
Caleb De’Ador – a man who knows the truth and trained by the elves – returns to his homeland. Haunted by prophecy and his own past, Caleb’s purpose is to raise an army of believers and teach humanity how to be free again.
But before this revolution begins, Caleb must reach the Living Stone.
At the same time, a long forgotten evil is unleashed, threatening to throw all living beings into an even greater darkness. A young woman, Eshlyn, takes on the task of warning her people and keeping her son safe.

What I Need & What You Get
$5000 of your help.
Good Lord. Why all that money?
First of all, like all professional books, it needs a good professional edit, which is an expensive endeavor. And since I am self-publishing, that money comes from me ... or you and me.
Second, some extra funds would help make the overall product look and feel more professional: graphics, cover art, website, etc. Many of these things I could do, but a little extra fundage would help with those things, too.
Oh, and there also needs to be some money to produce and ship the awesome rewards you get. Check 'em out.
Since the primary reason for this is to raise money for a professional edit, that will take time to get back, make corrections, etc, so that is why the target date for getting your ""perks"" seems so far away! The plan is to have this done by May, but I'm giving myself some wiggle room here.
And remember, the more money I raise, the better quality those perks will be!

If I make the goal, then you will be part of launching a great book and making it more accessible to the masses. If I don't make the goal ... well, I get to put out what I can and do it barebones.

Since I first step foot onto a small conservative bible college in southern Arizona, I made a commitment to reach the world for the Kingdom of God. In that 20 year journey we've youth pastored, launched a program called Master's Commission, were the District Youth Directors for our Assembly of God District, were mentored as  Church Planters at New Hope Oahu in Hawaii, planted a church in Sacramento and now God has called us to Hollywood to learn the art of filmmaking. So for the past 7 years I've been working in LA as an actor, producer and writer learning the as much as I can about how to make a movie. My goal now is to train churches from a Pastors perspective on how to make a movie. This e-Training Manual will be written with the church in mind and it's mission to reach the world with the Gospel. This decade alone several churches have proven that a church can make a movie. So my mission with this e-Training Manual is to give the tools and point out the assets that churches already have so that they can make a movie with the crew in the pew. We  also want to launch a training website and webinar series that will teach churches the skills needed to create life changing digital narrative.

<p>I decided to write my story, because, before starting my
transition, I was scared about it and I've serched someone that has
done it. I think my story can help other guy that want to start
transitioning.</p>
<p>I want tell them that, with courage and perseveration, you can
reach what you want and you can be happy.</p>
<p>The Storycode tells about a guys that was face to face with his
fears: to like himself, to be accepted, to continue to sing whith the
voice changing...and he did it!</p>
<p>I hope it can help people that feel theyr body not belong to them,
and find dangerous solution like suicide.</p>
<p>With my story I say that everybody can win a gender disorder.</p>
<p>Voice changing, in ormon therapy, is not easy, expecially for who
sings as a job, like me.</p>
<p>My experience explain how I work about it, who I asked to resolve
this problem.</p>
<p>This can be a valid help for who is afraid of voice changing in
ormon therapy.</p>

melodies. Everything flows and goes but emotions leave echoes in your
mind...and in my eyes She...
This is a love story, a journey to reach the girl that I've loved
for all of my life, through myself discovery and a total body change,
fighting in a world full of prejudice.
This happens with the help of music.

Music is the soundtrack of all moments of our life.
The “Storycode” is a book, an autobiographic love story. It
has two cds inside and qr codes through the pages, that contain
photos of my life from my birth until now.
It is an innovative very difficult project, that requires a lot of
time and money, so I ask you to help me to achive it.

This story tells about Enrico, an italian musician, in the middle
of his FTM transition from female to male, and difficulties he has to
pass trough.
He finds difficulties expecially with his job when his voice
changing.
He doesn't fall down about it and finds solutions not to miss the
music.
Often in the story, the memories of Her returns in his life.  A
lot of flashbacks explains Enrico's love to the same girl during his
entire life. Unfortunately, for different reasons during the story,
Enrico cannot reach her.
Until, with his self confidence, he finds the courage to tell his
feelings about her.
The protagonist is me, Enrico.
The sotry is writing by Ferruccio Scarpella, an italian writer. He
is able to write on paper my feelings.
The story is my autobiography, so it tells about real facts.
I'm a transgender italian musician and singer. I started my
transition two years ago in 2012, when I decided to discover the
origin of my pains that I feel during all my life.

Music is still the best part of me. I'm a song writer.
I love music, I love writing words. I sing to express myself, to
reinterpret myself and my emotions.
I have been writing music for 10 years, but I love singing cover
songs, too.
I have been studied music since I was 6 and....I have never stop
yet.
I sing, I play guitar and piano. I love all that is music, all
that shakes my body and soul.
Inside the Storycode, there are 2 cds, the first one made before
my transition, 3 years ago, with my female voice, and the second one,
under construction, with my male voice.
To realize my cds, I took advantage of the expertise of
professional musicians and singers, who are well-known in the North
of Italy and of professional recording studios to have the best
quality album.

The first cd “DO” features 10 songs, 8 covers and 2 songs
wrote by me:1. Don't you remember (Adele cover)
2 Sunrise (Norah Jones cover)
3 Thinking about you (Norah Jones cover)
4. Listen to your heart (Roxette cover)
5. A night like this (Caro Emerald cover)
6. Smooth operator (Sade cover)
7. Kiss Kiss (Holly Valance cover)
8. La notte (Arisa cover)
9. Do
10. La mia musica
The second cd “TRY TO DO IT” features 9 songs wrote by me:1. By my side
2. Senza nomi
3. Vento
4. Semplice
5. Cosa non darei
6. Everything of your life
7. Rosso
8. Girotondo
9. Sempre

click here if you want hear a mix of songs of either cds, to hear
the difference of voices.I can send the translation of the lyrics of my songs from italian to english language, if request.


Within the Storycode, there are often references to my songs.
You can find Qr Codes near them. So, with a simple click of your
smartphone, with an apposite app (Qr Code reader), you can see a
slideshow of photos relevant to different times of my life.
The reader can satisfy his curiosity and see my changing, so he
can be part of the story.

The Storycode is not a simple book, I don't want my story only to
be read but also heard and seen, just to involve all the senses of
the reader in a total innovative experience.

I think that the Storycode is an encouragement for everybody.
I decided to write my story, because, before starting my
transition, I was scared about it and I've serched someone that has
done it. I think my story can help other guy that want to start
transitioning.
I want tell them that, with courage and perseveration, you can
reach what you want and you can be happy.
The Storycode tells about a guys that was face to face with his
fears: to like himself, to be accepted, to continue to sing whith the
voice changing...and he did it!
I hope it can help people that feel theyr body not belong to them,
and find dangerous solution like suicide.
With my story I say that everybody can win a gender disorder.
Voice changing, in ormon therapy, is not easy, expecially for who
sings as a job, like me.
My experience explain how I work about it, who I asked to resolve
this problem.
This can be a valid help for who is afraid of voice changing in
ormon therapy.

- To LGBT people and community, that probably live everyday the
same situation as mine.
- To musician and singers, to who loves music and think music is a
life reason.
- To people that don't accept who is different from them. I hope
that reading my story, they realize that we are all the same, but we
are also a little different each others.

The goal is at 8000 euros. This is the list of costs I have to
have:


writer


book translator from italian to english language


book printing


musician and singers that rearranged my songs


recording studio 
	


cd printing


qr code generator


design


delivery


If you send money, you'll receive something in return.
You can find the list on the right of the page.If I reach the goal, I can make and post the videoclip of the song
“By My Side” 


you can share my project on facebook, twitter or email it to your
friends.

My first thanks to my family, that support me every day.
I say thanks to my friends, that accept me like who I am and they
have totally respect of me and my decisions.
I thaks to all of people that inspire me every day.
Thanks to everybody are cooperating for this project.
And last but not least, I thank you that belive in me and support

<p>My name is R.J. Cavender and I love
working with horror writers. <br/>
<br/>
That's why I'm hosting this second writers retreat at the historic and
haunted birthplace of Stephen King's <i>The Shining</i>, <b>The Stanley Hotel</b>
in Estes Park, Colorado. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to join us, simply register by choosing a package here on this campaign and I'll send you the code to receive
the group discount rate when you make your hotel reservations. <br/>
<br/>
*Editing Packages and Event Registration does not include your hotel room or
transportation fees. Hotel room rates are listed at the bottom of the page.* <br/>
<br/>
If you register now, you have an entire year to make your travel plans. And
your registration <i>does </i>include all our group discount perks, select
editing packages, inclusion on any outings/trips over the weekend, and a
guaranteed tour of Room 217. <br/>
<br/>

</p><p><span>I'll be setting up daily critique
groups and nightly meet-up times, giving those interested a chance
to hang out with fellow authors. But these aren't mandatory, and if you'd just
like time alone to write, you can do that too! We don't want to set a rigid
schedule or any programming that would take away from your writing time, since
this is a retreat and not a convention or conference. So no dealers room, and
limited programming. Instead we're offering a unique experience with a great
group of authors and publishing professionals, in a fantastic hotel with a
history steeped in horror (fiction?) <br/>
<br/>
Each package includes different perks that should fit the need of all authors,
whether you're looking for some feedback and a polishing of your work...or
you're just needing a great place to write and get away. Let us host your
once-in-a-lifetime writing escape, and we'll promise you a great time in a
scenic and spooky locale. <br/>
<br/>
For the last few years I've served as the pitch session coordinator for two
horror writers conventions, one of which I was also a co-chair. So I've had
some solid experience seeing how hosting events operates from the inside. And
with the first Stanley Hotel Writers Retreat being a successful event, we've decided to return in 2015 for a weekend we'll all
remember for years to come. I hope you find this idea as exciting as I do, and
I truly hope you'll join us for this unique and haunting writing experience! The Stanley Hotel is truly amazing...<br/></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1119696/files/20141227232650-2.jpg?1419751610"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1119698/files/20141227232720-3.jpg?1419751640"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1119702/files/20141227232759-4.jpg?1419751679"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1119705/files/20141227232837-5.jpg?1419751717"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><span></span>

My name is R.J. Cavender and I love
working with horror writers. 

That's why I'm hosting this second writers retreat at the historic and
haunted birthplace of Stephen King's The Shining, The Stanley Hotel
in Estes Park, Colorado. 

If you want to join us, simply register by choosing a package here on this campaign and I'll send you the code to receive
the group discount rate when you make your hotel reservations. 

*Editing Packages and Event Registration does not include your hotel room or
transportation fees. Hotel room rates are listed at the bottom of the page.* 

If you register now, you have an entire year to make your travel plans. And
your registration does include all our group discount perks, select
editing packages, inclusion on any outings/trips over the weekend, and a
guaranteed tour of Room 217. 

Join us on our Facebook group page and help us plan the trip together for 2015: https://www.facebook.com/stanleyretreat
I'll be setting up daily critique
groups and nightly meet-up times, giving those interested a chance
to hang out with fellow authors. But these aren't mandatory, and if you'd just
like time alone to write, you can do that too! We don't want to set a rigid
schedule or any programming that would take away from your writing time, since
this is a retreat and not a convention or conference. So no dealers room, and
limited programming. Instead we're offering a unique experience with a great
group of authors and publishing professionals, in a fantastic hotel with a
history steeped in horror (fiction?) 

Each package includes different perks that should fit the need of all authors,
whether you're looking for some feedback and a polishing of your work...or
you're just needing a great place to write and get away. Let us host your
once-in-a-lifetime writing escape, and we'll promise you a great time in a
scenic and spooky locale. 

For the last few years I've served as the pitch session coordinator for two
horror writers conventions, one of which I was also a co-chair. So I've had
some solid experience seeing how hosting events operates from the inside. And
with the first Stanley Hotel Writers Retreat being a successful event, we've decided to return in 2015 for a weekend we'll all
remember for years to come. I hope you find this idea as exciting as I do, and
I truly hope you'll join us for this unique and haunting writing experience! The Stanley Hotel is truly amazing...
Group discount tickets will be available through the hotel
for the Friday night Murder Mystery Dinner at The Stanley Hotel and the annual
Shining Masquerade Ball on Saturday night, as well! Group rates are also
available for ghost tours of the hotel and paranormal investigations.
Event registrations/packages are transferable, but non-refundable.
If you're not entirely sure if you can make it, please don't register.
Funds for this event will be spent as they come in, securing rooms, vehicles,
and other event expenses. Cancellations will create problems, so commit to this
now...don't flake out...and we'll see you then!

Fees for cancellation with the hotel and every last detail to reserve rooms are
listed below. Confirmation of perk/package redemption will be within 24-hours,
with instructions on how to redeem your room discounts at The Stanley Hotel
once you've registered. 

We hope to see you in October!

<h2>Im ""Expeditionsstil"" mit dem Fahrrad nach Island</h2>
<p>Sir Ernest Shackelton suchte Männer für seine Südpolexpedition mit folgender Anzeige: <br/> „Männer für gefährliche Reise gesucht. Geringer Lohn, bittere Kälte, lange Monate kompletter Dunkelheit, ständige Gefahr, sichere Rückkehr ungewiss. Ehre und Anerkennung im Erfolgsfall.“<br/><br/>Für die Islandreise wird es weder einen Lohn noch Ehre und Anerkennung geben. Dafür aber hoffentlich atemberaubende Natur, viele neue Erfahrungen, Eindrücke und unvergessliche Erlebnisse die man sich selbst erarbeitet hat.</p>
<p>Philipp und ich sind begeisterte Radfahrer, die bereits einige kleinere und größere Projekte verwirklicht haben. Unsere aktuelle Idee ist eine Reise nach und durch Island im ""Expeditionsstil"", d.h. wir nehmen unser Gepäck und unsere Nahrung größtenteils mit und werden zwar einer festen Route um Island herum und durch das Hochland folgen, uns allerdings auch von den Ereignissen leiten lassen.</p>
<p>Im Vordergrund stehen das wortwörtliche ""Erfahren"" von Entfernungen, Weite, Einsamkeit.</p>
<p>Am Ende wollen wir unsere Erlebnisse in Buchform (eBook, evtl fest gebunden) und als Fotovortrag dokumentieren und der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich machen. Ein Fotokalender bzw. Poster sind ebenfalls angedacht. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Warum wir eine Kampagne machen</h3>
<p>Expeditionen sind teuer!</p>
<ul>
<li>die Fahräder müssen ""islandfit"" gemacht werden</li>
<li>das Fährticket kostet pro Person 460€</li>
<li>Island selber ist teuer, da hohe Umsatzsteuer, und alles wird per Schiff importiert</li>
<li>Fahrräder müssen teilweise umgebaut werden</li>
<li>wir müssen viel Material mitnehmen, da das Wetter auf Island recht rau werden kann</li>
<li>Verdienstausfall für sechs Wochen</li>
</ul>
<p>Wir sind überzeugt vom Prinzip von ""Geben und Nehmen"" - und würden gerne diejenigen ""mitnehmen"", denen dieses einmalige Erlebnis verwehrt bleibt. Deswegen gibt es die Idee, die Reise ausführlich zu dokumentieren und euch so zu beteiligen. Eure Gegenleistung ist eine kleine Spende für unsere ""Expedition"".</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Was wir zurückgeben</h3>
<p>Jeder einzelne Euro hilft uns, unser Projekt zu verwirklichen. Wir wollen die Reise im Internet und in Buchform veröffentlichen und so unsere Erlebnisse allen zur Verfügung stellen. Des Weiteren haben wir einiges an Know-How gesammelt, was Fahrräder betrifft.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Kann ich euch sonstwie helfen?</h3>
<p>Selbstverständlich! Wer nichts zahlen möchte oder kann, aber trotzdem von unserem Vorhaben überzeugt ist, kann ungemein helfen:</p>
<p>Macht das Projekt bekannt!<br/>Wie jedes Projekt, lebt auch dieses von seiner Bekanntheit. Teilt es anderen Leuten über Email, Twitter, Facebook mit. Oder erzählt ihnen davon.</p>
<p>Positiver Zuspruch hebt die Motivation. Gerade in der Planungsphase hat uns immer auch die Frage begleitet: können wir das überhaupt machen?<br/><br/></p>

Am Ende wollen wir unsere Erlebnisse in Buchform (eBook, evtl fest gebunden) und als Fotovortrag dokumentieren und der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich machen. Ein Fotokalender bzw. Poster sind ebenfalls angedacht. 


Warum wir eine Kampagne machen
Expeditionen sind teuer!

die Fahräder müssen ""islandfit"" gemacht werden
das Fährticket kostet pro Person 460€
Island selber ist teuer, da hohe Umsatzsteuer, und alles wird per Schiff importiert
Fahrräder müssen teilweise umgebaut werden
wir müssen viel Material mitnehmen, da das Wetter auf Island recht rau werden kann
Verdienstausfall für sechs Wochen

Wir sind überzeugt vom Prinzip von ""Geben und Nehmen"" - und würden gerne diejenigen ""mitnehmen"", denen dieses einmalige Erlebnis verwehrt bleibt. Deswegen gibt es die Idee, die Reise ausführlich zu dokumentieren und euch so zu beteiligen. Eure Gegenleistung ist eine kleine Spende für unsere ""Expedition"".


Was wir zurückgeben
Jeder einzelne Euro hilft uns, unser Projekt zu verwirklichen. Wir wollen die Reise im Internet und in Buchform veröffentlichen und so unsere Erlebnisse allen zur Verfügung stellen. Des Weiteren haben wir einiges an Know-How gesammelt, was Fahrräder betrifft.


Kann ich euch sonstwie helfen?
Selbstverständlich! Wer nichts zahlen möchte oder kann, aber trotzdem von unserem Vorhaben überzeugt ist, kann ungemein helfen:
Macht das Projekt bekannt!Wie jedes Projekt, lebt auch dieses von seiner Bekanntheit. Teilt es anderen Leuten über Email, Twitter, Facebook mit. Oder erzählt ihnen davon.
Positiver Zuspruch hebt die Motivation. Gerade in der Planungsphase hat uns immer auch die Frage begleitet: können wir das überhaupt machen?",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My daughter, Kathi was diagnosed with <a href=""http://www.ihrfoundation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Intracranial Hypertension</a> when she was 17.  She doesn't always look sick, but she suffers from constant head pain, dizziness, nausea, whooshing in her ears, and vision issues.  She has lost her peripheral vision and has black spots in her normal visual field.  Because of her extreme dizziness, she tends to fall over without warning from time to time.  Sometimes, I'm there to catch her; other times, she just falls.  As her disease has progressed, she's also begun to experience what we call ""jittery legs"" -- her legs just suddenly start jumping around, out of her control, while she's walking.  That gets kind of scary because when she can't control her legs they sort of fly out from under her and she falls.</p>
<p>Kathi's an active college student.  She takes classes four days a week, and she's majoring in Zoology and Music.  On her Good Head Days (GHDs), that's not too bad.  But on her Bad Head Days (BHDs), it's grueling.  And dangerous.  I can't be there on campus with her because I have to work (I'm a single mom).  There aren't always railings for her to hold onto when she's walking from class to class, and her friends are on different schedules so they can't be there to walk with her.  </p>
<p>Kathi has been approved for a service dog through a service dog organization in El Cajon, CA.  This organization doesn't charge its recipients for their dogs and the training that goes with them, but they do work on a donation basis.  Kathi's dog will cost $10,000 to raise and train for Kathi's specific needs.  The organization relies on donations to pay for this, and it often takes 3 years before those funds are raised. </p>
<p>Kathi really needs her dog now, though, so she can continue to go to school.  Three years is just too long especially with her condition worsening the way it is.  She's been working hard since April to help the service dog organization raise the money.  So far, she's raised $4,000 with the help of our family and friends through donations, Pampered Chef and Origami Owl fundraisers, and making &amp; selling her own jewelry.  Here we are in August, the new semester has started, she's back in school, and we're still $6,000 short of her goal.</p>
<p>Please help Kathi get her service dog.  Any size donation will help, and we will be so grateful.  And if you prefer to donate anonymously, please send me an email at <a href=""mailto:DeiGratia1186@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DeiGratia1186@gmail.com</a> for instructions.  </p>

<p>According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, an estimated 6.6 million children under the age of 18 years live in households with at least one alcoholic parent.</p>
<p>Estimates are that over 11 million children under age 18 are children of alcoholic parents and that as many as 43% of the US adult population has been exposed to alcoholism in the family. Research findings suggest that these children are at risk for a range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral problems. Sadly a lot of these children grow up with shame, feeling unloved, guilt, depression and a variety of other issues because of their parents drinking.</p>
<p>Alcoholism in families is a worldwide issue. I was born and raised in the Bahamas and my dad was an Alcoholic. He was an absent figure in my life. On December 27th, 2010 he lost his life due to health related issues because of his years of alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>I have lived through the pain, the heartache and all the feelings of being a child of an alcoholic parent. I could have turned out to be an alcoholic myself, but I am not.</p>
<p>At 21, it is my goal to address the issue of Alcoholism in families. I want to share my story with young adults, teenagers, parents and anyone who have ever been affected by having a parent that suffered from addictions such as Alcohol Abuse. </p>
<h2>My Story: Life Doesn't JUST Go On...</h2>
<p>Life Doesn’t Just Go On… is a Memoir of my life that shares my story of growing up with an Absent, Alcoholic Father. I speak about the things I experienced as a child to the things I dealt with as a teenager, to the time now that I am a young adult dealing with life after my father's death. I speak a great deal about my spiritual journey, in losing my faith and finding it again, tackling grief, self growth, and personal healing.</p>
<p>The significance of this Memoir Life Doesn’t Just Go On… are the poems that are featured at the beginning of each chapter and the letter that I wrote to my dad just a month before his death. </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>I feel that too many times in life people aren't able to come to a place of peace<br/>with their parents or loved ones when they have been hurt. They aren't given the chance to fully heal through what it is that they are going through or went through. I have said the words, ""I hated my dad, he’s nothing more than a sperm donor, he’s dead to me"" and so on… Sometimes I feel that a person just needs to know that they are not the only one out there going through or experiencing something and this why I want to share my story. I want to be the example and the voice for that one person and many others, so that they can  know that they are not alone.</p>
<h2>Your Support</h2>
<p>Life Doesn't Just Go On will be published through Signalman Publishing. The manuscript is completed and ready to print. My initial goal is to raise $380 so that Life Doesn't Just Go On, can be printed and distributed before Christmas, but IndieGogo has a minimum fundraising goal of $500.</p>

This summer, from August 1<sup>st</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup>, we are planning a mission trip to Vietnam. We will spend time with the children of Lai Daihans abandoned by their Korean fathers who fought in the Vietnamese war. About 10-15 members of our church will go to Vietnam to teach English, build friendships, and share the love of Jesus.  </p>
<p align=""left"">For the trip, each person will need ~$1,500 for the round-trip airfare, lodging, and meals. In total, we would need $30,000. We hope to raise $6,000 through IndieGoGo.com.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>What We Call Love</i> is a multiple POV book about five black and brown teenagers from the city of Chicago. Specifically it is about the individual journeys of each as they navigate relationships with their families, with each other, and with themselves. It’s a story that addresses the usual problems teenagers go through but in the perspectives of individuals who are targeted every day in the United States by the color of their skin.<br/><br/>My name is Esther Huescas, and I am the author of <i>What We Call Love</i>. I wrote this book because I grew up loving coming of age love stories, fell in love with the characters, and became invested in them. As a Mexican-American woman with brown skin, I never was able to see myself as the protagonist. On the off chance that one of the main characters was a person of color, the movie adaptation would end up white washing them. <i>What We Call Love</i> is the book I wish I’d had the opportunity to read while growing up. As a minority in this country, I should be able to have a main character that looks like me, one that has a chance at happily ever after.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the importance in having a story where minority youth discover love and themselves. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to reminisce about what it feels like to be young and falling in love, escape from your everyday worries, learn from the characters the importance of allowing yourself to love. <br/><br/>In my book, <i>What We Call Love</i>, you will learn about the lives of Mariposa, Serenity, Jayden, Elijah, and Raymond. They are five teenagers from the city of Chicago. Mariposa and Elijah, 18-year-old Mexican twins, live on the northwest side of Chicago. Jayden is a 19-year-old Dominican from the west side. Eighteen-year-old Serenity is African American and lives on the city's south side. Raymond, a Nigerian from the north side, is 19.  <br/><br/>The story takes place in the beginning of the summer of 2019, after Mariposa, Elijah, and Serenity graduate high school. The majority of the story, with the exception of the last two chapters, takes place within one day during one summer night party. <br/><br/>Mariposa and Jayden have a complicated, romantic past, and they spend the book trying to figure out their feelings for each other and their future. Elijah struggles with being honest with himself and his sister. Serenity and Raymond had been dating for over two years and are in the perfect relationship in the eyes of everyone around them. Throughout the novel they navigate what college and moving away means for their relationship. Overall, it's a story of the five friends growing up in a city full of distractions and hope. <br/><br/>You will love this book if you want to feel the butterflies of young adult love.<br/><br/><i>What We Call Love</i> speaks to minority inner-city youth who grapple navigating relationships and discovering their passions and dreams.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>What We Call Love</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>How did your first and most prominent example of love (parents, family, television, music, etc) shape how you view and define romantic relationships?</li>
<li>How do you believe stressors, such as poverty and racial inequality, impact romantic relationships?</li>
<li>How are young minorities impacted when they do not see themselves as protagonists in mainstream literature?</li>
</ul>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing love, socioeconomic inequality, gun violence, gang violence, and systemic racism will change us all for the better. <h3>The Book - <i>What We Call Love</i>
</h3>The book is written in 3 Parts.... <br/><br/>Part 1 contains the Author’s Note + Chapters 1-5. In this Part the reader will be introduced to all five main characters of the novel. The five characters are Mariposa, Serenity, Jayden, Elijah, and Raymond. The reader will learn about where they stand when it comes to love and what they wish to become. The characters are all getting ready for Serenity’s 18th birthday party in Part 1.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 6-10. The reader learns about the characters’ complex relationships with each other, and some characters share how it felt when they began to fall in love. The party they all attend starts in Part 2.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 11-18. In these chapters, the party and the problems that arise from it are what changes the five friends. Part 3 is the most honest because until this point they have not been truthful with themselves about what they want going into the future. Some of them stay in love, while others learn to first love themselves. <br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>

<h3>My story</h3>
<ul>
<li>Three years ago I was simply a girl who was passionate about the sea and sailing as well as theatre, lighting design and drawing. One day I realised I wanted to get into a big adventure, after a year of search and volunteer work I found Draken. A viking ship. Going across the North Atlantic.</li>
<li>While sailing I was writing and drawing every day to record the daily routine and observations of life onboard and nature surrounding us. The adventure became one of my most life changing experiences. Going through my notes and putting them into a book helped me to adjust to land life when I got back. It was also a way to preserve precious details of the experience and emotions while they were fresh in my memory!</li>
<li>After 2 years I finally decided to publish this book based on my journals so I could share this story with you. Now the only thing I need to accomplish the goal is to make sure there are people who are interested in this project and find the financial support to make it real!</li>

<p>The book will be hardcover and contain about 64 pages with text and drawings/sketches on every page. Most of them I made on the ship and some were made later as illustrations.</p>
<p>The book is based on my sailor's journal. It tells the story of 21 days at sea, crossing the North Atlantic on the Draken Harald Harfagre, sailing from Norway to Newfoundland. It tells about our daily routine onboard and the way we adopted to the challenging conditions, the nature we encountered and things I learnt. The narration is divided in 21 day</p>

<p><strong>A short extract from the book:</strong></p>
<p><i style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Living on the ship you get used to the idea that there’s no such thing as a simple, one-move action. Everything has to be planned, choreographed and given at least triple the amount of time to which you’re used to whilst on land. Making a cup of coffee might take about 10 minutes. Going to the heads takes up to 20. Simply walking from one end to another (which is less than 34 metres distance) can easily take about 3 to 5 minutes.</i></p>
<p><i>With every other step you think a few steps ahead, you need to maintain your balance, make sure to avoid all the lines and blocks flapping in the air, be ready for seaspray and expect the unexpected. With all that considered, you leave a little room for your dance through the ship to appear in the least bit graceful.</i></p> <p><i>From now on we have two people to watch out for icebergs. We’re getting closer to the ice. No ships, no buoys, not a single sign of human intervention. It is a new and very special feeling when being on bow duty your main mission is to spot a white giant. A little white dash on the canvas of the sea, which can bring big troubles to our little wooden “canoe” if missed by the radars and the sharp eye of the lookout.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The story is written in English because I lived through the experience mainly speaking English and using English (as well as Swedish and Norwegian) sailing terms. Though, I am considering printing a Russian version too.</p>

<h3>
<i>Åren som försvann ""The years that disappeared""</i>- a short summary in english, then a presentation in six acts in swedish.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>""Åren som försvann"" or in english ""The years that disappeared"" is an upcoming book written in Swedish about Malin, when it begins she is a 25-year-old top student with her whole life ahead of her. But she has lived for a long time with great stress she herself was not really aware of, and which the story will tell us a bit about in broken chronology. This together with her being a sensitive person, this causes her to suffer from psychosis. A glass window is smashed so that her knuckles bleed, she suffers from delusions where reality is mixed with imagination. Without being a part of what is happening around her, she has ended up in a psychiatric ward, surrounded by people with startling symptoms who have sometimes been ill for much longer than herself. Sometimes not.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After a while she gets better bur it is a long road back to a normal life, with internships with vague purposes, with medicines, with visits to psychologists, but also unexpected, interesting meetings. Against impossible odds, she finds a way out of her illness and can both find her way back to working life and find the love of her life. The book is not only an exciting autobiographical description of a young woman's struggle to take back her life, it also provides a unique description of what it is like to be mentally ill and how Swedish healthcare works from a patient's perspective. Not to mention the way out from the illness and back to a normal life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is my own story that I have made into a book.  The main reason I have behind that I do this is because that I really want to break the stigma of mental illness. To take a current example from Sweden, when I saw this year's ""Swedish Eurovision on TV, I felt really anxious for a moment when the artist Måns Zelmerlöw came in singing on stage about another artist called Christer Björkman, joking about him having a psychosis. So, nowadays in prime time on Swedish television, one can joke about psychosis, when there is so much else that everyone knows that it is not okay to joke about. Such as race, gender and disabilities. Which I really think we shouldn't, as long as we are not joking about ourselves. But nearly no one dares to be the face of psychosis or mental illness- And I say the reason is not only that many people are too sick. The reason is definitely also the stigma.It has taken me 13 years to finally speak. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And now.</p>
<p>A longer text In my mother's tongue Swedish (the book is written in Swedish).</p>

<p><i>Åren som försvann</i> är en kommande bok som handlar om Malin, när vi kastas in i handlingen är hon en 25-årig toppstudent med hela livet framför sig. Men hon har levt länge i en inre stress hon inte själv varit riktigt medveten om, och som även berättelsen ska komma att i bruten kronologi förtälja en del om. Tillsammans med hög sårbarhet gör detta att hon drabbas av psykos.</p>
<p>En glasruta krossas så knogarna blöder,  hon drabbas av vanföreställningar där verklighet blandas med fantasi. Utan att vara med på vad som händer omkring henne, har hon hamnat på en psykiatrisk avdelning, omgiven av människor med  häpnadsväckande symptom som ibland varit sjuka betydligt längre än hon själv.  Ibland inte.</p>
<p>Sedan följer den långa vägen tillbaka till ett normalt liv, med praktikplatser med luddiga syften, med mediciner, med psykologbesök, men även oväntade, intressanta möten.

<h3>En kort sammanfattning</h3>
<p>Jag heter Malin Lindmark och är den som skrivit boken <i>Åren som försvann</i> som den här kampanjen samlar in pengar till. Ursprungligen kommer jag från Borås, men är numera bosatt i Göteborg. Här bor jag med min man och min son, född januari 2019.</p>
<p>Skrivandet har varit min följeslagare större delen av livet, och jag har författat allt ifrån diverse ifrågasättande insändare till smärtsamma och underfundiga dikter. Numera är jag leg. gymnasielärare i svenska, svenska som andraspråk samt konst och kultur och sedan 2016 undervisar jag vuxna i svenska som andraspråk.  </p>
<p><i>Åren som försvann</i> är min första roman och självbiografi som skildrar några svåra år i mitt liv. Min förhoppning är att den ska kunna ge hopp till andra som genomlever liknande svårigheter och att det kan finnas ett ljus i slutet av tunneln.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Dags att bryta stigmat kring psykisk ohälsa</h3>
<p>För att ta ett aktuellt exempel så när jag såg årets melodifestival på tv, kände jag för ett ögonblick en sten i bröstet när Måns Zelmerlöv kom in sjungandes på scenen om Christer Björkman, ""...han hade fått en psykos.."". Att man på detta sätt på bästa sändningstid i Sveriges television kan skämta om psykossjukdom, när det är så mycket annat som alla vet att det inte är okej att skämta om längre gör mig bedrövad. Men det säger också något om varför min bok verkligen behövs.</p>
<p>Jag har själv funderat på hur kollegor och bekanta kommer att reagera om de läser min bok? Kommer de tänka annorlunda om mig om de får veta min bakgrund som före detta psykossjuk? Kommer de ifrågasätta min kompetens som lärare? När jag blev gravid med vår son för ca tre år sedan blev jag återigen påmind om min bakgrund. Jag önskade få samma behandling som alla andra gravida kvinnor, jag ville helst fokusera på lyckan men inte. För säkerhets skull skickades jag att prata med en psykolog under graviditeten. Utan att jag själv önskat. Jag tänkte, ska jag aldrig bli kvitt det här? För att inte tala om när han precis fötts. Då var det ännu värre. Man sprang i dörrarna för att titta på mig och se om jag började få symptom, pratade också med min man om mig bakom ryggen. </p>
<p>Jag tror att jag är helt rätt person att skriva den här boken. Jag är en isbrytare och samtidigt en historieberättare. Min bok innehåller inte bara allvarliga saker. Där finns också mycket värme, humor, relationer och kärleksintriger. Jag tror och hoppas att den som läser den kan bli lika underhållen som informerad. Den läsaren skulle kunna vara du.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Vad vi behöver &amp; vad du får</h3>
<p>Det råder ingen tvekan om att den här boken kommer att ges ut i december 2021.</p>
<p>När jag hade skrivit klart boken skickade jag mitt manus till sju mindre förlag, fyra av dem ville oberoende av varandra ge mig chansen. Till slut bestämde jag mig för ett samarbete med Tallbergs förlag. Jag gillade deras profil och hur de i flera av sina böcker tagit ställning och lyft fram personer ur andra utsatta grupper i samhället.</p>
<p>Det är pga covid-19 man har fått utöka antalet hybridkontrakt och därför erbjuder de ett sådant.</p>
<p>Det går ut på att jag kommer att stå för ungefär en tredjedel av kostnaderna med boken själv (tryckkostnaderna som är på 40 000 kr) och förlaget står för resterande två tredjedelar som är att ge ut boken som tryckt bok och e-bok, registrera på bokinfo, korrekturläsning, sättning, marknadsföring, lagerkostnad, distribution och försäljning (enligt förlagets uträkning kommer detta att hamna på ca 100 000 kr första året). Vi siktar då på att ge ut boken i 1000 exemplar.</p>
<p>Jag har satt som mål att enbart samla ihop till min del av kostnaden, som är 40 000 kr, men det är ett flexibelt mål. Om inte alla pengarna kommer in genom den här kampanjen kommer boken att ges ut ändå. Då skjuter jag nämligen själv till det som saknas. Så viktigt är det här projektet för mig. Jag gör inte detta för att bli rik, utan i första hand för att jag anser att budskapet i boken är viktigt. Dels vill jag berätta min historia, men jag tror och hoppas också att min berättelse kan hjälpa andra som drabbats av svårigheter. Visa att det finns ett ljus någonstans där i slutet av tunneln.</p>
<p>Genom att förbeställa boken genom min Indiegogo-kampanj kan du förutom att känna att du är med och stöttar en viktig och ovanlig berättelse också få chansen att se ditt eget namn tryckt inne i boken, kanske med en kort hälsning från mig. Du kan vara en av de första att äga ett signerat exemplar, och om du känner dig riktigt generös, kan du även få träffa mig personligen via zoom och på en halvtimmes videodejt med mig. Då får du ställa frågor om boken och annat som rör mitt författarskap.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Nyttan som boken kan göra </h3>
<p>Den här boken är viktig därför att det är en av få skildringar av en psykossjukdom ur ett patientperspektiv. Den är också viktig eftersom den vill belysa att det faktiskt kan gå bra efter en sådan upplevelse. Att det med rätt stöd går att bli frisk, komma in på arbetsmarknaden igen, finna kärleken och skaffa barn om man så kan eller önskar. Helt enkelt leva ett normalt liv. Vad det nu är? Ja, det kan finnas olika livsåskådningar. Men det viktigaste är : Du kan få må bra och leva i harmoni. Det finns hopp. Dessutom kan boken vara ett viktigt komplement till facklitteratur för de som ska arbeta inom sjukvården eller till anhöriga till personer med psykisk ohälsa. <br/> </p>
<h3>Risker &amp; utmaningar</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Som med alla projekt kan det finnas risker. En sådan risk är t.ex. att boken inte blir klar i tid. Den risken är dock väldigt liten. Manuset är färdigskrivet och jag har redan ett väl etablerat förlag (Tallbergs förlag) i ryggen som kommer ge ut boken, så snart de fått betalt. Vilket de får när kampanjen är avslutad. De har lovat mig att boken ska kunna levereras i december, förhoppningsvis innan julafton och jag litar på deras kompetens.</p>
<p>En annan risk är förstås att jag inte får in tillräckligt med pengar. Men i sådana fall kommer jag skjuta till de pengar som behövs ur mitt eget sparkapital för att boken ska bli av. </p>
<p>En annan utmaning är att ge kampanjen tillräckligt med spridning. Jag är en flitig användare av de flesta sociala medier och kommer att använda de kanalerna för att synliggöra kampanjen. Min man Marcus Malinda Lindmark har också lovat att hjälpa till att sprida informationen om kampanjen till alla han känner.   </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Andra sätt du kan hjälpa till</h3>
<p>Du kanske känner att du tycker det här är ett viktigt projekt, men din ekonomi tillåter dig inte att vara med och bidra. Jag förstår. Jag har också haft perioder i livet då jag haft ont om pengar. Det är bland annat det jag skriver om i boken. </p>
<p>Jag skulle dock uppskatta om du ville vara med och sprida ordet. Dela en länk hit till kampanjen i sociala medier du använder t.ex. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn eller Instagram. Det kanske bara tar dig någon minut att göra, men för mig kan det göra stor skillnad.</p>

""Åren som försvann"" or in english ""The years that disappeared"" is an upcoming book written in Swedish about Malin, when it begins she is a 25-year-old top student with her whole life ahead of her. But she has lived for a long time with great stress she herself was not really aware of, and which the story will tell us a bit about in broken chronology. This together with her being a sensitive person, this causes her to suffer from psychosis. A glass window is smashed so that her knuckles bleed, she suffers from delusions where reality is mixed with imagination. Without being a part of what is happening around her, she has ended up in a psychiatric ward, surrounded by people with startling symptoms who have sometimes been ill for much longer than herself. Sometimes not.
 
After a while she gets better bur it is a long road back to a normal life, with internships with vague purposes, with medicines, with visits to psychologists, but also unexpected, interesting meetings. Against impossible odds, she finds a way out of her illness and can both find her way back to working life and find the love of her life. The book is not only an exciting autobiographical description of a young woman's struggle to take back her life, it also provides a unique description of what it is like to be mentally ill and how Swedish healthcare works from a patient's perspective. Not to mention the way out from the illness and back to a normal life.
 
This is my own story that I have made into a book.  The main reason I have behind that I do this is because that I really want to break the stigma of mental illness. To take a current example from Sweden, when I saw this year's ""Swedish Eurovision on TV, I felt really anxious for a moment when the artist Måns Zelmerlöw came in singing on stage about another artist called Christer Björkman, joking about him having a psychosis. So, nowadays in prime time on Swedish television, one can joke about psychosis, when there is so much else that everyone knows that it is not okay to joke about. Such as race, gender and disabilities. Which I really think we shouldn't, as long as we are not joking about ourselves. But nearly no one dares to be the face of psychosis or mental illness- And I say the reason is not only that many people are too sick. The reason is definitely also the stigma.It has taken me 13 years to finally speak. 
 
And now.
A longer text In my mother's tongue Swedish (the book is written in Swedish).
*********************
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Åren som försvann är en kommande bok som handlar om Malin, när vi kastas in i handlingen är hon en 25-årig toppstudent med hela livet framför sig. Men hon har levt länge i en inre stress hon inte själv varit riktigt medveten om, och som även berättelsen ska komma att i bruten kronologi förtälja en del om. Tillsammans med hög sårbarhet gör detta att hon drabbas av psykos.
En glasruta krossas så knogarna blöder,  hon drabbas av vanföreställningar där verklighet blandas med fantasi. Utan att vara med på vad som händer omkring henne, har hon hamnat på en psykiatrisk avdelning, omgiven av människor med  häpnadsväckande symptom som ibland varit sjuka betydligt längre än hon själv.  Ibland inte.
Sedan följer den långa vägen tillbaka till ett normalt liv, med praktikplatser med luddiga syften, med mediciner, med psykologbesök, men även oväntade, intressanta möten. Mot omöjliga odds hittar hon en väg ur sin sjukdom och kan både hitta tillbaka till arbetslivets och finna sitt livs kärlek.
Boken är inte bara en spännande självbiografisk skildring om en ung kvinnas kamp för att återta sitt liv, den ger också en unik skildring i hur det är att vara psykossjuk och hur den svenska sjukvården fungerar ur ett patientperspektiv. För att inte tala om vägen ut och tillbaka.
 
En kort sammanfattning
Jag heter Malin Lindmark och är den som skrivit boken Åren som försvann som den här kampanjen samlar in pengar till. Ursprungligen kommer jag från Borås, men är numera bosatt i Göteborg. Här bor jag med min man och min son, född januari 2019.
Skrivandet har varit min följeslagare större delen av livet, och jag har författat allt ifrån diverse ifrågasättande insändare till smärtsamma och underfundiga dikter. Numera är jag leg. gymnasielärare i svenska, svenska som andraspråk samt konst och kultur och sedan 2016 undervisar jag vuxna i svenska som andraspråk.  
Åren som försvann är min första roman och självbiografi som skildrar några svåra år i mitt liv. Min förhoppning är att den ska kunna ge hopp till andra som genomlever liknande svårigheter och att det kan finnas ett ljus i slutet av tunneln.
 
Dags att bryta stigmat kring psykisk ohälsa
För att ta ett aktuellt exempel så när jag såg årets melodifestival på tv, kände jag för ett ögonblick en sten i bröstet när Måns Zelmerlöv kom in sjungandes på scenen om Christer Björkman, ""...han hade fått en psykos.."". Att man på detta sätt på bästa sändningstid i Sveriges television kan skämta om psykossjukdom, när det är så mycket annat som alla vet att det inte är okej att skämta om längre gör mig bedrövad. Men det säger också något om varför min bok verkligen behövs.
Jag har själv funderat på hur kollegor och bekanta kommer att reagera om de läser min bok? Kommer de tänka annorlunda om mig om de får veta min bakgrund som före detta psykossjuk? Kommer de ifrågasätta min kompetens som lärare? När jag blev gravid med vår son för ca tre år sedan blev jag återigen påmind om min bakgrund. Jag önskade få samma behandling som alla andra gravida kvinnor, jag ville helst fokusera på lyckan men inte. För säkerhets skull skickades jag att prata med en psykolog under graviditeten. Utan att jag själv önskat. Jag tänkte, ska jag aldrig bli kvitt det här? För att inte tala om när han precis fötts. Då var det ännu värre. Man sprang i dörrarna för att titta på mig och se om jag började få symptom, pratade också med min man om mig bakom ryggen. 
Jag tror att jag är helt rätt person att skriva den här boken. Jag är en isbrytare och samtidigt en historieberättare. Min bok innehåller inte bara allvarliga saker. Där finns också mycket värme, humor, relationer och kärleksintriger. Jag tror och hoppas att den som läser den kan bli lika underhållen som informerad. Den läsaren skulle kunna vara du.

<p><b>I've written a book to help people
conquer their nicotine demon forever.</b></p>
<p><b>I just need your help with this last step - in exchange for which I'll give you the book at a special pre-launch price and various other good things... Please donate to help with publishing and marketing. It will make a big difference to me and even $10 would be great!</b></p>
<p>I've spent the last
four years helping people quit smoking and now I'd like to be able to help a
lot more. In fact, I'd like to help millions to quit if possible. </p>
<p>Everyone knows how
hard it is for people to quit smoking as well as the consequences of not being
able to do so, if only from the shocking anti-smoking campaigns on TV - and the
fact that six million people die from it every year. What many people don't know is how tobacco has been manipulated and enhanced so that now only 2.5% people who try and break free on
their own are able to succeed. </p>
<p>My book ‘<i><span>Quit Smoking Now and Forever:
Releasing the Nicotine Demon’</span></i> provides a way out for all the
people who want to quit, of which there are estimated to be 28 million in the
US alone.</p>
<p>After working on it
for a little over a year the entire text is finally finished and ready for publication. Yippee!</p>
<p>It totals almost
40,000 words and includes tons of information on cigarettes, how tobacco has
been manipulated to get people so addicted, how to quit (using herbs, hypnosis,
homeopathic remedies, food, breathing techniques etc.) and how to stay free
forever. It is designed to speak to the conscious as well as the subconscious
mind - as it's the latter that keeps people smoking despite wanting to quit.
The book is full of powerful visualizations which can be listened to online and
also includes 3 video EFT or Tapping sessions, an explanation of how to do
basic EFT (Tapping) at home, as well as an quit smoking hypnosis mp3 which can
all be downloaded from the website. </p>
<p>If someone reads the
book, follows the instructions and experiences the mind changing hypnosis and
EFT sessions they <i>will</i> be able to quit smoking. Given 60% of smokers are
destined to die 10-15 years before their time from a smoking related disease,
helping someone quit would be a very good thing.</p>
<p>The book has been professionally edited and the front cover has already been designed (as you can
see above). All that remains is to raise the money to get it published (and online and in the
stores) with First Edition Design Publishing - a great self-publishing company.
I also need a professional website where people can access the quit
smoking hypnosis mp3, the ""Tapping"" videos, the visualization mp3s
and the forum. </p>
<p>As far as marketing goes I
still need to create 4 videos for the on-line marketing campaigns (which are already written and which I can film
myself), get them edited (which needs to be paid for) , edit the 3 EFT videos, set up a sales website for the book, and
pay for some Google and Facebook Ads.</p>
<p>Rather than do a less
than perfect job or have to wait until I have all the money necessary to go
ahead (or worse, have to borrow the money from the 'banksters'),<b> I am offering the book at a special pre-release price and asking
for your assistance </b>even in the case you have no personal use for the book. Even $10 would be great! For each donation I am
offering something in return. I hope you like your gifts of thanks. </p>
<p>With the help from
backers like you the book will get to the people who need it, sooner rather
than later - and it will get done right. Thank you in advance for your support
and I hope to be able to return the favor one day for a crowd funding project
of your own.</p>
<p><b>This is how the book starts....  </b></p>
<p><i>“There was a young lady named Mae</i></p>
<p><i>Who smoked without stopping all day;</i></p>
<p><i>As pack followed pack,</i></p>
<p><i>Her lungs first turned black,</i></p>
<p><i>And eventually rotted away.”  </i>Edward Gorey, Floating Worlds    
                     
                     </p>
<p>“<i><span>Giving up smoking is the easiest thing in the
world. I know because I've done it thousands of times.</span></i>” Mark Twain</p>
<p>I dedicate this book
to all the people in the world who go through addiction and come out the other
side wiser and stronger.</p>

<p><b>Author’s Note </b></p>
<p>The nicotine demon
works by hijacking your brain, your body, your mind; some would say, even your
soul. This dark creature surrounds you in a gray cloud where you can wander for
years, sometimes not even realizing you are lost. Until for some reason, one
day, you awaken and find yourself hankering after bright sunshine again. </p>
<p>All this time he’s
been fooling you into thinking you needed him - even that you liked him - while
behind the scenes his dark smoky tentacles have been slowly sucking the life
out of you. In the same way that real parasites like a tapeworm gives off
chemicals to make you desire the kind of food they want to eat, the nicotine
demon manages to convince you that you are the one choosing to smoke, rather
than it needing you, its host, to keep it fed. Adopting this perspective is the
first step to victory. </p>
<p>Once you know you have
a nasty parasite living inside of you, controlling you, you can’t help but
develop a strong urge to get rid of it. In fact I suspect you would do whatever
was required to get it out of your body as fast as possible! This book is about

<p><b>Introduction </b></p>
<p>Bravo for deciding to
quit! Bravo for deciding to kick your nicotine addiction! Bravo for choosing to
be free! Bravo for having the guts to stand up to the nicotine demon! Going
back to being a non-smoker is the best decision you will ever make, and with
the help of this book and its associated content you will succeed. </p>
<p> In many ways I’m
a lot like you. I used to be a smoker. I really liked it actually. I totally
bought into the “cigarette in one hand, glass of wine in the other” thing. I
thought I was rather sophisticated; especially with those little brown
cigarillos I used to smoke during the time I lived in Paris. Then a number of
things happened.......................... (ah, you'll have to buy it if you want any more!)</p>
<p><b>Risks and challenges of the project</b></p>
<p>I don't actually see
any risks. There is a huge market for the book and with the right marketing
(I'm paying for classes on launching on the internet with PLF4 by marketing
wizard Jeff Walker) it will be very successful I'm sure. There is no other book
(program) quite like it. <br/>
Except for creating a few videos the program is ready to go out into the world! <br/>
My only challenge has been getting this last bit of money together to get the
book published and launched. Depending on how much money I can raise, the publishing will happen first, then the professional videos and then the marketing.</p>
<p><b>Perks of supporting me </b></p>
<p>Pre-launch price for the book: $19.95 (instead of $24.99), plus $3.99 shipping</p>
<p>$10 donation gift: Time to really get
some sleep! For a donation of $10 or more I will send you a powerful mp3 of a
hypnosis session for deep relaxation and sleep (created by me) to your email
address.</p>
<p>$29 donation gift: A higher vibration! With this donation I give you an mp3
of a hypnosis session for deep relaxation and sleep AND an mp3 of a series of positive statements for
contemplation (including powerful subliminals) designed to increase your vibration and
understanding of who you are.</p>
<p>$100 donation gift: The book package! For this generous donation I will give you the $29 gifts and a 2 signed copies of the physical book, including shipping, with my thanks!</p>
<p>$250 donation gift: Wow, thank you! If you in, or can make it to Key West, it would
be my pleasure to invite you for dinner at our house. I will also send you the book package AND offer you a personal Skype session with me to be used for hypnosis and EFT for
releasing negative emotions, habits or for past life regression for yourself or
a friend. I'll also put your name on the acknowledgements page of the book (if received
by time of publishing).</p>
<p>If you are not able to help financially, I completely understand but I would love it if you could help get the word out for me and share this on Facebook etc.</p>

</div></div>","I've written a book to help people
conquer their nicotine demon forever.
I just need your help with this last step - in exchange for which I'll give you the book at a special pre-launch price and various other good things... Please donate to help with publishing and marketing. It will make a big difference to me and even $10 would be great!
I've spent the last
four years helping people quit smoking and now I'd like to be able to help a
lot more. In fact, I'd like to help millions to quit if possible. 
Everyone knows how
hard it is for people to quit smoking as well as the consequences of not being
able to do so, if only from the shocking anti-smoking campaigns on TV - and the
fact that six million people die from it every year. What many people don't know is how tobacco has been manipulated and enhanced so that now only 2.5% people who try and break free on
their own are able to succeed. 
My book ‘Quit Smoking Now and Forever:
Releasing the Nicotine Demon’ provides a way out for all the
people who want to quit, of which there are estimated to be 28 million in the
US alone.
After working on it
for a little over a year the entire text is finally finished and ready for publication. Yippee!
It totals almost
40,000 words and includes tons of information on cigarettes, how tobacco has
been manipulated to get people so addicted, how to quit (using herbs, hypnosis,
homeopathic remedies, food, breathing techniques etc.) and how to stay free
forever. It is designed to speak to the conscious as well as the subconscious
mind - as it's the latter that keeps people smoking despite wanting to quit.
The book is full of powerful visualizations which can be listened to online and
also includes 3 video EFT or Tapping sessions, an explanation of how to do
basic EFT (Tapping) at home, as well as an quit smoking hypnosis mp3 which can
all be downloaded from the website. 
If someone reads the
book, follows the instructions and experiences the mind changing hypnosis and
EFT sessions they will be able to quit smoking. Given 60% of smokers are
destined to die 10-15 years before their time from a smoking related disease,
helping someone quit would be a very good thing.
The book has been professionally edited and the front cover has already been designed (as you can
see above). All that remains is to raise the money to get it published (and online and in the
stores) with First Edition Design Publishing - a great self-publishing company.
I also need a professional website where people can access the quit
smoking hypnosis mp3, the ""Tapping"" videos, the visualization mp3s
and the forum. 
As far as marketing goes I
still need to create 4 videos for the on-line marketing campaigns (which are already written and which I can film
myself), get them edited (which needs to be paid for) , edit the 3 EFT videos, set up a sales website for the book, and
pay for some Google and Facebook Ads.
Rather than do a less
than perfect job or have to wait until I have all the money necessary to go
ahead (or worse, have to borrow the money from the 'banksters'), I am offering the book at a special pre-release price and asking
for your assistance even in the case you have no personal use for the book. Even $10 would be great! For each donation I am
offering something in return. I hope you like your gifts of thanks. 
With the help from
backers like you the book will get to the people who need it, sooner rather
than later - and it will get done right. Thank you in advance for your support
and I hope to be able to return the favor one day for a crowd funding project
of your own.
This is how the book starts....  
“There was a young lady named Mae
Who smoked without stopping all day;
As pack followed pack,
Her lungs first turned black,
And eventually rotted away.”  Edward Gorey, Floating Worlds    
                     
                     
“Giving up smoking is the easiest thing in the
world. I know because I've done it thousands of times.” Mark Twain
I dedicate this book
to all the people in the world who go through addiction and come out the other
side wiser and stronger.

Author’s Note 
The nicotine demon
works by hijacking your brain, your body, your mind; some would say, even your
soul. This dark creature surrounds you in a gray cloud where you can wander for
years, sometimes not even realizing you are lost. Until for some reason, one
day, you awaken and find yourself hankering after bright sunshine again. 
All this time he’s
been fooling you into thinking you needed him - even that you liked him - while
behind the scenes his dark smoky tentacles have been slowly sucking the life
out of you. In the same way that real parasites like a tapeworm gives off
chemicals to make you desire the kind of food they want to eat, the nicotine
demon manages to convince you that you are the one choosing to smoke, rather
than it needing you, its host, to keep it fed. Adopting this perspective is the
first step to victory. 
Once you know you have
a nasty parasite living inside of you, controlling you, you can’t help but
develop a strong urge to get rid of it. In fact I suspect you would do whatever
was required to get it out of your body as fast as possible! This book is about
exposing the nicotine parasite (or nicotine demon as I like to refer to it),
getting you 100% motivated to do whatever it takes, and giving you the remedy
to conquer it forever.
