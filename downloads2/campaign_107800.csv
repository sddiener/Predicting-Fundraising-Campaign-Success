<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>PRIMECom Corporation</strong> is a Canadian Radio-Television Telecommunication Commission (CRTC) certified production , media and advertising company based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. We produced content for OMNI TV (a Rogers Company), Shaw Spotlights (formerly Shaw Community TV) and Filipino TV (FTV) for several years already. Our production team is composed of Filipino-Canadians who are entrepreneurs and also practicing professionals in Engineering, Health and Real Estate and Media Industry.</p>
<p>In our desire to create more content and fill up the time slots offered to us by our TV network affiliates, we contacted Dante Nico Garcia, a Filipino filmmaker whose first film, Ploning, became the entry the Philippines for the 81st Oscar Awards. Dante has been an advocate of films and content that promote the beauty of the Philippines and the talent of the Filipinos, waiting for the perfect partners to help him produce all the film and television show concepts he has developed through the years. We feel that this is the best time for Filipinos and people who care for the Filipinos, to come together and not only create content that entertain and educate, but also support good causes with every season produced. In line with this, Dante created FilipiNow, a portal where we feature the Filipino which presents fresh and new stories of the Filipino as they move in the here and now. This will be a good vehicle to connect with Filipinos who've never been to the Philippines, haven't seen or experienced living in the Philippines, and those who want to visit the Philippines. </p>
<p>“New normal, new stories, new lives...” The way of life that the Filipinos are experiencing nowadays goes under the microscope with this unique peek into their lives. Every episode gives viewers a slice of life of the Filipinos today.</p>
<p>We have successfully launched our first FilipiNow episode under Pinoy Konek show last February 28, 2021 Our second episode is currently aired in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, Canada via OMNI TV.</p>

The Impact
If the FilipiNow brand of content becomes a staple in Filipino homes all over the world, parents need not worry anymore about their children losing their Filipino identity.

Risks & Challenges
The risk is more on the idea that if we don't pursue this advocacy, today's children that are born and raised away from the Philippines, and the ones quarantined indefinitely in their homes, will develop identities according to the content they consume.
How to sustain the quality of the content produced in connection to the demand to make every content relevant to every Filipino anywhere in the world will be the biggest challenge once this advocacy has started.

<h2>WELCOME! </h2>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to consider donating to <i>Parked In America</i>, a television pilot that is going into production in late October! </p>
<p>This show has been in development for the past year and we can't believe it's finally time to start production. <i>Parked In America</i> tells the story of Jamie Park, a rebellious, family-oriented teenager who moves in with her aunt's family after tragedy strikes back home in Korea. Helmed by a talented, diverse group of NYU students, we have the opportunity to portray a story not often seen in traditional media while exploring themes such as family and personal acceptance. </p>
<p>By donating to the show, you are directly assisting us in bringing this story to life. Not only are you supplementing our educational experience here at NYU, but your donations allow us to reach our fullest potential. We invite you to read a letter from our show's creator, meet the members of our team, and scroll through some of our FAQ's. We are so grateful to you for taking the time to learn more about this show - thank you, thank you, thank you. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHY WE'RE DIFFERENT / OUR IMPACT!</h2>
<p><strong>From Creator Kayla Lewis:</strong></p>
<p>This project is heavily inspired by my personal experience as a Korean American and the experiences of my mother and grandmother as Korean immigrants. I wrote this story not only because I wanted to, but because I felt the need to share our story with the world, and to express my gratitude to these two women who continue to shape my identity and teach me what it means to be Korean. I’m the daughter of a Korean immigrant and a white midwesterner, and watching my mother interact with my father’s family has always been interesting for me to see: how they all change around each other, and the culture clashes I found between them. Growing up existing between two worlds has given me many experiences that have not yet been portrayed on screen that I feel like others who look like me can relate to. </p>
<p>At NYU film, the second largest demographic is the Asian community. From all around the world, Asian cinephiles come to study here at a predominately white school in a predominately white industry. Though some grew up on international films with faces that looked like theirs, most did not. And whether or not they grew up with people who looked like them on screen, none of them represented the kind of lives and stories we are living now. And that’s why we’re here: to share the stories we live now so that more people like us can see more people like us on screen.</p>
<p>Coming off of recent successes in the box office, it’s clear that representation matters and people need to see themselves on the big screen. However, Asian stories are still some of the least represented in the media. With this project, my hope is to tell an authentic story that can reach all audiences, Asian American or otherwise. </p>
<p>Most importantly, this series is about embracing differences. In this divisive time in our history, I think we all need a reminder that we are one, big, dysfunctional family, like the Barnes and Park families in our show.</p>

<h2>THE CHALLENGES WE'LL FACE!</h2>
<p>As you can imagine, making a 30-minute television pilot comes with a lot of obstacles. Just a few possible challenges include...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Being able to feed a cast/crew of over 25:</strong> On student films, cast and crew aren’t being paid, so the most the production can offer them is a set that includes wonderfully cooked meals and provides the appropriate snacks to sustain that cast and crew of 25 over the course of 6 long, 12-hour shoot days. </li>
<li>
<strong>Making sure we are minimizing our carbon footprint: </strong>Doing our part for the environment is important, so we have committed to creating a green set and will have a dedicated Green Manager who’s job it is to ensure we are not only recycling properly but using as many biodegradable products and food ingredients on set (we want to show our commitment to this and thus are seeking a donor who is equally committed to that cause)</li>
</ul>
<p>Above are just a few possible challenges that will arise during pre-production and production. Luckily, since the creation of this show is a part of an official NYU class, we are given class time to meet with one another! During this time (about 10 hours a week), we have the opportunity to collaborate and work together to solve problems that arise. Even though we are still students, every single one of us is wholeheartedly committed to creating the best show possible. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP US! </h2>
<p>We completely understand that not everyone is able to donate - and want you to know that there are so many ways that you can help us turn this show into a reality!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Follow us on social media and show us some love!!!</strong> You can follow us on Facebook and Instagram <u>@parkedinamericashow</u>. The more people that follow us, the more people will find out about our show! </li>
<li>
<strong>Share our fundraiser! </strong>Every share on Facebook, mention on Instagram, and Twitter shoutout matters. </li>
<li>
<strong>Help us connect with other Asian creatives! </strong>A huge hope of ours is that we will be able to collaborate and gain attention from Asian creatives in the entertainment industry. Almost all of our department heads (including the Showrunner, Director, Executive Producer, Cinematographer, and Production Designer) are of Asian descent. We would love to connect with other Asian creatives to gain industry insight and advice! </li>
<li>
<strong>Donate food or locations!</strong> We are going to have to feed over 25 cast and crew members and are always looking for more snacks to have on set! In addition, we are actively looking for a school and home to film in! Have any leads or connections? Let us know (reach out to us at parkedinamericashow@gmail.com)! </li>

You can check out our credits below.</p><p>Now, this isn't just any comedy show. It's a chance to see your favorite actors and comedians - with their real dogs.</p><p>We have regulars on the show, like Mark Fite from Tenacious D's Festival Supreme and Two Headed Dog, and Samm Levine from Freaks And Geeks and Wet Hot American Summer.

Some people who have expressed interest in appearing on the show include: Tom Lennon, Neil Hamburger, Maria Bamford, Margaret Cho, Ron Lynch, Brian Posehn, Jon Daly, Iliza Shlesinger, Baron Vaughn, Lauren Weedman,  Howard Kremer, Mike O'Connell, Jerry Minor, and more.</p><p>We have some networks interested in our show, so we are raising money to make the pilot and show them how great it would be to see this on the air every week. It's funny and it has dogs, and who doesn't love funny dogs?</p><p>Plus, because we believe in comedy for good, a portion of the profits will be donated to Best Friends NKLA, a no kill shelter here in Los Angeles.

Except neither of them knows anything about dogs. The show was written by us: Tony Camin and Ali MacLean.  We've written and performed on TV before. You can check out our credits below.Now, this isn't just any comedy show. It's a chance to see your favorite actors and comedians - with their real dogs.We have regulars on the show, like Mark Fite from Tenacious D's Festival Supreme and Two Headed Dog, and Samm Levine from Freaks And Geeks and Wet Hot American Summer. Plus a whole bunch of professional canine stars, who have more training than the both of us.Each week a special celebrity guest star will come on with their dog, interacting with both the human and canine actors. Some people who have expressed interest in appearing on the show include: Tom Lennon, Neil Hamburger, Maria Bamford, Margaret Cho, Ron Lynch, Brian Posehn, Jon Daly, Iliza Shlesinger, Baron Vaughn, Lauren Weedman,  Howard Kremer, Mike O'Connell, Jerry Minor, and more.We have some networks interested in our show, so we are raising money to make the pilot and show them how great it would be to see this on the air every week. It's funny and it has dogs, and who doesn't love funny dogs?Plus, because we believe in comedy for good, a portion of the profits will be donated to Best Friends NKLA, a no kill shelter here in Los Angeles. So it's like we are making important art AND saving lives.You can help us achieve our goal  - make the pilot and help dogs find homes! THE CAST:Tony CaminTony has appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Real Time with Bill Maher, and lots of others that have been cancelled.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In our first year together, we were learning. We wanted to become actors with a well rounded understanding of filmmaking and the ability to create and follow through on our ideas, rather than actors who were just trying to get hired on whatever project we could find an audition for. We made ten short films in twelve months with a budget of about $120 for each (go to <a href=""http://www.thursdayAF.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thursdayAF.com</a> to see them).  But now our skills and imaginations have blossomed into what is now Wild Wild Yogis! A show about five social media influencers that attend an exclusive yoga retreat led by a spiritual Guru, where they are confronted with the hard truths hiding behind their online personas.</p>
<p>Five writers spent weeks with the original pitch, brainstorming ideas and breaking the episodes, the characters, and the story arc. Two producers looked over all that work, offering perspective and reminding us we couldn't shoot a car crash or blow up a ranch. After a series of rewrites, table reads, rehearsals and one fundraiser on the books, we have 4 days in the can which enabled us to cut together this super fun trailer! However, we still need six more days of shooting in order to finish production. Then of course the post production process begins! Editing, color correcting and sound mixing will make this project look (and sound) like something you'd find on a Hulu Original series without all the bureaucratic run-around. This series comes from our hearts, and we can't wait to share it with the world!</p>
<p>The only way to do that is through your contributions. Although we have self-funded half of the project, we are simply unable to do this alone. Each contribution creates a web that supports our budget, which is mostly spent on the camera and sound departments. We also have some location fees, post production costs, and the all important need to feed our cast and crew. Without contributors, Wild Wild Yogis will be stuck in film limbo like so many projects that don't have a community to support them. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $5,000 to finish shooting Wild Wild Yogis. We'll need more once we get into post production, but our main focus is to get the episodes in the can before the summer is over. </p>
<ul>
<li>$2,700 of this amount goes to pay our cinematographers, and rent our camera and lighting gear.</li>
<li>$900 goes to our sound specialist,</li>
<li>$250 for our location fees, </li>
<li>$900 to keep the crew happy with full tummies!</li>
</ul>
<p>As incentives, we've come up with a few really cool gifts.</p>
<ul>
<li>$25 gift incentive is an autographed photograph of the entire cast and crew.</li>
<li>$150 gift incentive ADDS an orange #namafuckinste t-shirt just like our yogis wear in the show.</li>
<li>$500 gift incentive ADDS a DVD of all 6 episodes (Nobody else in the WORLD will have a hard copy except people at this donation level).</li>
<li>$1000 gift incentive ADDS 2 VIP tickets to our exclusive wrap party.</li>
<li>$2500 ADDS an Executive Producer credit. This means that the project will have your name on it.</li>
<li>As a special incentive, the donor with the highest gift donation will be given the actual peace pipe used in the filming of this show.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Wild Wild Yogis was created out of a need to take control of our futures in Hollywood. We're not waiting to be hired on a project; we're creating our own. We're not hoping a project is well-written; we're crafting something from our hearts, our vulnerabilities, and our funny bones. When you contribute, you support each of us in these efforts. </p>
<p>You also support the story; and through the story, you support each viewer. This show is hilarious, but it touches on difficult issues with which people struggle in everyday life such as emotional abuse, depression, gender identity, and diversity. We highlight the cult-like nature of social media, the dichotomy between real life and the way it's presented for the masses, the manipulation behind popularity, and the breakdown of spirit that comes when you put your faith in fame.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Making a film is always a puzzle and a challenge, and with Wild Wild Yogis there are several hurdles to jump.<br/>First, we are shooting outside on location: we have to get our shots scheduled that day within the daylight we have. No studio interior and lights to give us endless day. That challenge is amplified with negotiating the sound of our scenes with the sound of planes flying over the valley.<br/>We don’t have unlimited time, either: to shoot WWY we only have 6 more days, due to budget and cast and crew availability. So we must be able to make our days (filmmaker lingo for getting all that day’s planned shots DONE), and as we are a union project - we must get everything done within the union timeframes we are allowed for shooting.<br/><br/>Post Production:<br/>Remember those airplane noises we have to navigate? Well it’s not just those, other things can make their way into our sound files, like the crinkle of tarp from our tent interiors, wind, or dogs barking. So we need to clean up those audio tracks and then also add in the sounds that truly bring the auditory film to life. Ambient sounds, sound effects, music, etc. Also in post production the film will need coloring: to make all the brilliant colors of WWY production design pop on screen.</p>
<p>Distribution: and then there is the challenge of getting g WWY out there: spreading the word,  submitting to film fests, and pitching the series to platforms like Amazon and Hulu.<br/><br/>We are eager and ready for the challenges, but all this can only move forward if WWY is funded the rest of the way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Every contribution helps us reach our goal. If dollar bills are difficult for you at this time, there are many other ways you can help.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, just share this link and the trailer. The more people who see this campaign, the better. Not only does it help raise more money, it raises awareness of the project.</li>
<li>A huge help is donating hot lunches for our cast and crew during filming days. We shoot long hours, and one way to show the team we love them is through FOOD.</li>
<li>Post production assistance. Once we've finished shooting everything, we are going to need a lot of help in the post production area of expertise. Donations of time, or even referrals to great folks that may work below their going rate help tremendously.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it for now! Thanks for reading about our show. We can't wait to have you involved and show you the finished product!</p>

<ul>
<li>Venue hire and expenses (filming in a cinema is not exactly straightforward)</li>
<li>Cast and crew transport &amp; catering (most of the cast &amp; crew lives in the outer west)</li>
<li>Production design &amp; costuming</li>

<h2><strong>Our Goal</strong></h2>
<p>When we dream, we dream big! We would love to see this web-series screening at short film festivals globally.

<p>Some major factors regarding the success of this series include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Each of our crew members is in their element and is 100% dedicated to their role</li>
<li>The entire series has been shot in 4k using a RED Scarlet Gemini</li>

<p>Dear family and friends,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am creating a web series called “Hooked” that will target girls in their teens and young adults. The show follows a socially awkward girl in college as she navigates through life with the unfortunate circumstances of peer pressure both in dating and social scene among other girls. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are many life lessons that viewers will learn from this show including staying true to what you believe in, never giving up, and never changing your values to impress others. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The budget is $30,000. Any contribution to help make this happen, no matter how big or small, would help. Please contribute through indegogo.com. For anyone who contributes over $500 will get a producer credit as well as a walk on role if you want to be filmed (Dates for that are late Sept - early Oct).</p>

In Part 2, we want to up the stakes in the scale, quality and goals of the series... but we need your help. What the eff is this?Looking Into Lockout Laws is a series of online comedy investigations by Brisbane filmmaker and satirist Martin Ingle. With sharp wit and tongue firmly in cheek, earnest fake journalist Martin investigates Queensland’s recent slate of reduced alcohol service laws, as well as the paradigm of lockout laws which have taken hold across Australia in recent years.
Do these laws actually work to reduce “alcohol-fueled violence” as politicians claim?
Is the impact on small businesses and the late night economy too much?
Why are casinos conveniently exempt from these laws?
And what does this say about Australia’s relationship with alcohol, if similar laws don’t exist in other thriving modern cities?
Through man-on-the-street reporting and interviews with key stakeholders, Looking Into Lockout Laws is the nightlife’s fun, inventive response to a timely, serious issue.Throughout the episodes, the previously square and straight-laced Martin goes on a personal journey of discovery too, learning that safe drinking habits are essential to a good night out, and overall emphasising that no matter what the laws are in place, personal responsibility while drinking is the key that all sides of the issues can agree on.In Episode 1, naive reporter Martin hit the streets to get a first-hand perspective on the effect of Queensland’s reduced service laws.

<h3>What Happened</h3>
<p>For years, Joanna had been secretly compiling group texts from her very best friends about their various work stories and shenanigans, as well as her own. All along she threatened to write them into a web series, and one day, they unexpectedly came rolling out of her and into a script.</p>
<p>She's lucky that her best friend, Mira, also happens to be an enormously talented (but surprisingly unsuccessful) actor, who has been a part of bringing similar projects to life. A long time ago, Mira discovered Joanna's superb writing skills and had been looking for an opportunity to ride those coat tails for a while.</p>
<p>And thus was born, ""Formal Complaints"". It's a hilariously written series inspired by real life events and dramatic humans, and what would happen if you combined them all into one tiny space and forced them to intersect.</p>
<p>Joanna and Mira plan to shoot this summer (2019), and make something spectacular for your viewing pleasure, to be released publicly on the internet. It's a passion project in many ways: we are passionate about the script, passionate about our talents, and passionate about each other.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Please Help Us</h3>
<p>So this is the awkward part where we ask you to break out your wallets. </p>
<p>Here's the deal: regardless of how much of a budget we get, we are making this thing. There's no question.</p>
<p>However, we would really love to have our ideal budget behind us so we can realize this dream as much as possible and make something that we can be really proud of. Considering we are still young millennials and need to pay for silly things like food and a roof over our heads, we are hoping to offset the funds as much as we can.</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown of where some of your donations will be spent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food. We're going to have to feed a lot of people.</li>
<li>Props &amp; Costumes</li>
<li>Equipment Rentals (Lights, sound, etc.)</li>
<li>Website Fees &amp; Editing Software</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ultimately, the goal is to create a professional quality show that is easily accessible to you (the public) that's hilariously entertaining, relatable and memorable.</p>
<p>As well, we have a... unique... sense of humour, especially when we combine forces, that we are ready to unleash upon the world. Our communal strange brand of humour was born when we, just two young ladies (who no one would ever think would have anything in common), somehow connected in our souls and stuck by each other through the weirdest times of our lives. That heart and humour is interwoven into the Formal Complaints script, and we think that it will be a really special experience for our eventual audience. Or horrifying. Who knows?</p>
</div><div>
<p>Mira has been a part of many a web series in the past, and is confident that the knowledge of the talented people she has worked with has rubbed off on her. We have great people in our corner, and Mira is not afraid to bug every single person she knows in the industry with questions.</p>
<p>Lastly, we really are two people that can make anything happen, and that's 90% of the battle.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We get it. Not everyone has money to throw around at things that haven't even been made yet. Totally cool. If you'd still like to help us out non-monetarily (or even in addition to monetarily), here are some ways you can do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word!!! Share our campaign. Share our Facebook and Instagram pages (both are @formalcomplaints). Share our website: formalcomplaintsseries.com. Oh and give the show a watch when it comes out, yeah?</li>
<li>Are you a thespian or think you could be good at acting and live in Calgary? Come out and audition for us! Keep up to date on our Facebook and Instagram so you don't miss when we post auditions.</li>
<li>Do you have experience working on set? Come play with us! We will be hiring many crew positions throughout the summer, through our Facebook and Instagram.</li>
<li>Are you insanely organized and enthusiastic, but have no (or only some) prior experience on set? Come play with us too. Personality and a thirst for knowledge matter too.</li>

<h2>About Our Series</h2>
<p>Co-Created and run by two USC School of Cinematic Arts students, Hannah Ceselski and Sara Linden, Funny Business is inspired by their real life experience working on a college television show. And all eight episodes have already been written so it's up to you to help it get made!</p>
<p>The series itself focuses on an eclectic mix of student writers and producers working on The Wednesday Show, a live comedy show on their college TV station. If not for the show, they would never speak to each other. As it stands, they spend far too much time together.</p>
<p>In this show, created by people who liked ""Studio 60"" far too much, we see what happens to this team under fire. Adventures are had and secrets are kept. There's sabotage and gags that go on far too long. The stakes are inexplicably high, and the tensions between the staff members are alarmingly sexual.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515531977/xa0sgynagiam2qq7w4ep.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

She works for the Trojan Vision show “The Breakdown” as a Senior Producer, The Sack of Troy as a Staff Writer/Photo Editor, and she has been making people listen to her music in the car since 1996.

<p>Roma came all the way from New York City to Los Angeles just to work on Funny Business. Somehow along the way she stumbled into the screenwriting major at USC, in which she is now a sophomore. She is also a staff writer on “The Breakdown,” but does not write for the Sack of Troy like her Co-Creator counterparts because she avoids all writing that isn’t in screenplay format like the plague. Somebody once told her that if you can’t laugh you’ll cry, so after years of being called a crybaby by the bigger kids, she finally learned her lesson and turned to comedy.</p>
<p>She originally joined the Funny Business team as the writer of episodes 3 and 6, but then Hannah and Sara thought she had moxie and promoted her to Producer. She plans to repay them with her first child, but for now she’ll just settle for helping bring their show to life.</p>

<p>With an 8 episode (10-12 minute episodes) first season already written, Funny Business will be shot over 8 weekends, with 1 6 days of shooting total. Each shoot day will range from 10-12 hours, adding up to 20-24 hour weekend shoots.  </p>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>Luckily, since our Funny Business crew is made up of film students, our show has access to personal cameras and equipment for the shoot, which knocks out a major category from our budget.</p>
<p>However, with an ensemble cast and crew, a huge portion of our budget will go towards catering and craft services to ensure everyone gets fed. Following that, locations will be our next biggest spend, with miscellaneous (props, costumes, etc.) and distribution/festival fees bringing us to a total budget of $2,600.</p>

</div></div>","About Our Series
Co-Created and run by two USC School of Cinematic Arts students, Hannah Ceselski and Sara Linden, Funny Business is inspired by their real life experience working on a college television show. And all eight episodes have already been written so it's up to you to help it get made!
The series itself focuses on an eclectic mix of student writers and producers working on The Wednesday Show, a live comedy show on their college TV station. If not for the show, they would never speak to each other. As it stands, they spend far too much time together.
In this show, created by people who liked ""Studio 60"" far too much, we see what happens to this team under fire. Adventures are had and secrets are kept. There's sabotage and gags that go on far too long. The stakes are inexplicably high, and the tensions between the staff members are alarmingly sexual.

<h3>National Digit Wrestling Association</h3>
<p>Ahoy, </p>
<p>My name is Doug Driesel Jr. I created The NDWA, or National Digit Wrestling Association. I also play twin brothers Baron von Satan and Baron von Lucifer. What <i>is</i> the NDWA, might you ask? It's Professional Thumb Wrestling (it's a thing)! We dress in costume, have entrance themes, cut promos, do ALL the stuff that they do on WWE, only when it comes time to throw each other around, we thumb wrestle. </p>

</div>
<div> </div>
<p>We've been doing shows on the web, television, and in front of crowds since May of 2019. We have three webseries: <i>NDWA Thursday Night Thumbderdome</i> (our free show) and <i>NDWA Sunday Thumbday </i>(our Patreon-exclusive webseries) and <i>NDWA Thumbs Squared</i> (our ""Social Distancing"" show that temporarily replaced the other two while we can't get together). We've had four PPVs: ThumberSlam! '19, Thumb for the Holidays, January Jam 2020, and The Heavy Heads Thumb Monarch Tournament. We started a live show at The Springfield Improv just before the safer at home restrictions. We've done other live shows at The Outland. Our show <i>NDWA Thursday Night Thumbderdome</i> aired for 10 episodes on Mediacom Channel 85. We have designs on local broadcast television. </p>

Ahoy, 
My name is Doug Driesel Jr. I created The NDWA, or National Digit Wrestling Association. I also play twin brothers Baron von Satan and Baron von Lucifer. What is the NDWA, might you ask? It's Professional Thumb Wrestling (it's a thing)! We dress in costume, have entrance themes, cut promos, do ALL the stuff that they do on WWE, only when it comes time to throw each other around, we thumb wrestle. 


The most recent regular episode of NDWA Thursday Night Thumbderdome before the outbreak. 

 
We've been doing shows on the web, television, and in front of crowds since May of 2019. We have three webseries: NDWA Thursday Night Thumbderdome (our free show) and NDWA Sunday Thumbday (our Patreon-exclusive webseries) and NDWA Thumbs Squared (our ""Social Distancing"" show that temporarily replaced the other two while we can't get together). We've had four PPVs: ThumberSlam! '19, Thumb for the Holidays, January Jam 2020, and The Heavy Heads Thumb Monarch Tournament. We started a live show at The Springfield Improv just before the safer at home restrictions. We've done other live shows at The Outland. Our show NDWA Thursday Night Thumbderdome aired for 10 episodes on Mediacom Channel 85. We have designs on local broadcast television. 


Our very first episode of NDWA Thursday Night Thumbderdome from all the way back in May of 2019.

 
It's time to step up our production. And to us that means one thing: WE NEED A RING! 
If you've seen our product, you know that, while we've evolved over the last year, the vast majority of what we've shot, we've shot at a local arts center, creating a makeshift ""ring"" and ""entry way"" out of art display boards. But, we're ready to hit the big time! 


The second episode of NDWA Thumbs Squared, our ""social distancing"" show we're putting out during the outbreak. 

 
This campaign is to finance us getting a ring. The type of ring we are planning on getting is the cheapest ring. It's a 10'x10' ""backyard wrestling ring."" Where are we going to put it? In someone's two-car garage! And that will be NDWA's new headquarters! 

WE NEED A RING TO HIT THE BIG TIME, AND YOU GET TO SHOW HOW MUCH OF A FAN YOU ARE!!!
We've set the goal at $3,000. The ring itself is $1,600. The shipping on the ring is $500. That's $2,100. The rest goes toward operating fees (the instructions for the ring say we need to get some lumber for set-up, merch production for rewards) and IndieGoGo fees.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Abby Denton. I'm a writer, stand-up comic, and total babe. <a href=""https://twitter.com/mizabitha"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You might know me off the Internet</a>. You might not. I mean, it's fine if you don't. I just write <a href=""https://medium.com/mammon-machine-zeal/ultraviolent-flash-games-after-9-11-b416b836f28e"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">moving, insightful essays about outsider art and culture</a>. It's no big deal if you've never heard of me. I don't mind. I'm fine. I don't know why you're making such a big de<strong>PLEASE FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER</strong></p>
<p>I like sitcoms. Who doesn't? Lovely, safe, warm sitcoms, with all the schemes and quips and nonthreatening reflections of the foibles of modern society. Foibles that the cast will survive - as will you, and me, and everyone else. Ahhhh. Nice.</p>
<p>I recently wrote Cyber Cafe, a sitcom in an audio format, and produced a pilot episode, which you can listen to on Soundcloud, below:</p>
<p><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/abby-danger-denton/cyber-cafe-episode-1-brains"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/abby-danger-denton/cyber-cafe-episode-1-brains</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Cyber Cafe is a sitcom for your ear-holes set in the near future of 20XX. (Eventually people realized things would just keep getting stupider and agreed to stop counting years.) Technology has changed some things - our lead character, Sam, is a brain in a jar - but for the most part people are the same kinds of stupid as they've always been.</p>
<p>Sam works as a coffee sweetener (don't ask) in a cafe, along with Honey, a car crash survivor who got rebuilt to look surprisingly like a Barbie doll, and Emily, a.k.a. D4rk R34p3r, a radical hacktivist who, admittedly, spends most of her time pirating dirty anime. You know the one. Together these workplace compadres face modern and near-future problems like livestreaming their sensory experiences, being forgotten by The Algorithm, and begging strangers for money online (wahey!) You'll love it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Format</h3>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have 6 episodes of this show in the pipeline, and we need some help getting space in a recording studio and feeding the cast, taking a group of starving artists and making them simply ""artists,"" free to pursue whatever new attributive verbs they wish. They may even experiment with adjectives, the dirty little minxes.</p>
<p>Worry not, O ye of little cash: I'm going to be producing this out-of-pocket whether you help me out or not. The problem is, I have those cartoon pockets where you turn them inside out and a little fly buzzes merrily away. Plus, I'm a type 1 diabetic with an electrical pancreas (I've been cyberpunk since age 12) and synthetic insulin isn't cheap. It will take a lot longer, is what I'm saying.</p>
<p>This is not the kind of project that will produce a lovely coffee table book or a cube of pure tungsten. If you want these things, I cannot help you, but you might be able to find them via Bing or AskJeeves. The show will be freely available to you to listen and download no matter what. But we WILL read out your name in the last episode if you donate. Check out our meager rewards tiers if you're into it.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I can't afford a recording studio. If I produced this out of my apartment, there'd be cars roaring past in every scene, ambulances, fire trucks. I live in Westlake, which might charitably be referred to as Los Angeles's siren district. Without a quiet space to record this show, it would sound like the cast lives and works in a highway overpass, which I admit is an arresting premise, but not the premise we're working with. This is a sitcom about a brain in a jar. Try to keep up.</p>
<p>We need your generous donations to make this happen. Your returns will be meager, but on the bright side, your support will ensure we don't become, say, The Lucky Strikes Cancer-Free Cigarette Hour Featuring Jack Benny. We couldn't afford Benny anyway.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>If we raise $1,100 or more, we'll be able to make a down payment to produce the last episode as a live show in the Los Angeles area in late March, giving you a chance to see the exciting conclusion before anyone else in the world! (We'll also do it in-studio to make sure the recording is good.) If we make enough to produce this, anyone who donates more than $10 will receive a free ticket to the show!</p>

Hi! I'm Abby Denton. I'm a writer, stand-up comic, and total babe. You might know me off the Internet. You might not. I mean, it's fine if you don't. I just write moving, insightful essays about outsider art and culture. It's no big deal if you've never heard of me. I don't mind. I'm fine. I don't know why you're making such a big dePLEASE FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER
I like sitcoms. Who doesn't? Lovely, safe, warm sitcoms, with all the schemes and quips and nonthreatening reflections of the foibles of modern society. Foibles that the cast will survive - as will you, and me, and everyone else. Ahhhh. Nice.
I recently wrote Cyber Cafe, a sitcom in an audio format, and produced a pilot episode, which you can listen to on Soundcloud, below:
https://soundcloud.com/abby-danger-denton/cyber-cafe-episode-1-brains
 
The Story
Cyber Cafe is a sitcom for your ear-holes set in the near future of 20XX. (Eventually people realized things would just keep getting stupider and agreed to stop counting years.) Technology has changed some things - our lead character, Sam, is a brain in a jar - but for the most part people are the same kinds of stupid as they've always been.
Sam works as a coffee sweetener (don't ask) in a cafe, along with Honey, a car crash survivor who got rebuilt to look surprisingly like a Barbie doll, and Emily, a.k.a. D4rk R34p3r, a radical hacktivist who, admittedly, spends most of her time pirating dirty anime. You know the one. Together these workplace compadres face modern and near-future problems like livestreaming their sensory experiences, being forgotten by The Algorithm, and begging strangers for money online (wahey!) You'll love it.
 
The Format
We'll be making 6 episodes of this show, to go online free for you to listen and download and show your friends and pretend it's 2012 and make wacky Youtube Poops. (When I was a student we called Youtube Poop ""bricolage."") Episodes will be released one a month, the first of the month, with the finale going out on April 1. Well, maybe April 2 now I see it written out. Don't want people thinking the climax is an April fool's joke.
Episodes are a full half-hour, not like sitcoms these days, with their 11-minute commercial breaks and their baffling respect for the dog's art of improv and their episode scripts you could fit on a napkin. No. We're too good for network television. They asked me, begged me to work for them, but I said no. I'm too principled.
You may have noticed that I said this was in audio. Yes, this is a radioplay, for two big reasons:
1. That's how sitcoms worked in the beginning, back when they all had names like ""The Lucky Strikes Cancer-Free Cigarette Hour Starring Jack Benny.""2. I'm broke.
So we're going old-timey and we hope you'll come along.
IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: When I say we're going old timey, I mean structurally. We're not going to start calling people ""pinkos"" and refusing to vaccinate our children, like my uncle did when he joined a swing-music revival band. To the best of our abilities, we're leaving the bad stuff in the 40s. Got it?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jared Sartin and I am the DM for <a href=""http://twitch.tv/herebedragonsdnd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Here Be Dragons</a>, a Dungeons &amp; Dragons series on Twitch. The cast on the couch for our main storyline is my wife Lindsey Sartin and our friends Lauren Byrd, Nathan Ondracek, and Austin Schumacher. We came together to start a Dungeons &amp; Dragons Campaign in early 2019. Our initial run consisted of a bunch of cobbled together tech that we had - and each week it differs slightly.</p>
<p>Our goal for this Indie GoGo is to build a set, improve our tech, and focus on the story weekly - not set-up and tech issues.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are looking to build our set and tech, we are hoping to raise $1000+ to offset the costs for the set build. To get the full set and tech upgrades our estimates put us closer to $2000 in total costs.</p>
<p>Our set will be about $750+ of supplies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage flats from Ecoset LA, estimated $0-$100 (depending on what they have)</li>
<li>Transportation of flats, estimated $100</li>
<li>Paint, estimated $50</li>
<li>Fake fur blankets, estimated $60</li>
<li>Lighting, estimated $200</li>
<li>Fake torches and candles, estimated $150</li>
<li>Sound dampening, estimated $100</li>
<li>Misc building supplies, estimated $75</li>
<li>DM Chair, estimated $30 (second hand!)</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also looking to improve the tech after we get a set built, which totals around $900+:</p>
<ul>
<li>4x Shotgun mics for the players, estimated total $200</li>
<li>4x Mic Stands, estimated total $150</li>
<li>6x XLR Cables, estimated total $50</li>
<li>8-channel USB sound board, estimated $150</li>
<li>2x Tripods, estimated total $50</li>
<li>2x High-end web-cam, estimated total $275</li>
<li>Misc cables/hubs, estimated total $25</li>
</ul>
<p>Rough rendition of the set (for context, we currently have the blue couch against a plain, tan wall and a dark wood table).</p>

<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons is making a comeback. We have many other ""competitors"" - some big names and others newer like us - they are all great. Our challenge is creating a network fans and follower who join for our adventures, shenanigans, and unicorns. There are many ways to enjoy D&amp;D. We do not want to be a firehose of content, but rather provide creative and consistent entertainment on a regular basis.</p>

<h3>The Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Mile High Chronicles (MHC) production team has over <strong>50 years of combined experience</strong> in television and video production. We realized that important stories unfolding in <strong>Denver</strong> were being passed over, treated like “flyover country” by the cultural centers on both coasts. The expansion of online and mobile video make cultural centers ubiquitous - <i>they can be anywhere now</i>.</p>
<p>Our aim is to create original, compelling web series that give voice to perspectives that wouldn’t otherwise be seen.</p>
<p><strong>Mile High Chronicles</strong> follows Kassandra, a twenty-something visionary with trust issues. A new arrival to the Mile High City after being conned out of a job and a work visa, Kassandra drives for Dryft, an extreme-bargain ride-share service. But her real passion is to create a ground-breaking mobile App. In each four-to-six minute episode, Kassandra comes into contact with colorful local characters - their favorite ""products"" (wink-wink) - and slightly <i>hallucinatory scenes from movie classics</i>.</p>
<p>By the end of the first season, Kassandra will learn that it’s easier - and more fun - to do something important with a group of people you can trust. She’ll also plant the seeds for building IRL community, and help confront a group of violent, <strong>Trump-embolden neo-Nazis</strong>.</p>
<p>This campaign is critical  not only for raising production funds, but also for bringing Mile High stakeholders into the process. We want to build community by empowering people tell their own stories.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>You are part of the Team! A Co-op with Altitude!</h3>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is to make sure that actors and crew get at least a small stipend for their hard work on Season One. If we were in New York or Los Angeles, we’d need to raise $30,000. To help our actors pay for babysitters on shoot days, we think $8500 is a reasonable target. And more important than the total number of dollars, <strong>we want to identify and grow the number of people in Colorado who are into the idea of supporting local artists</strong> - even if the contribution is what you might pay for a ticket at the Multiplex.</p>
<p>We have some amazing perks in exchange for your support, such as subscriptions to our Patreon channel which will include behind the scenes specials.</p>
<p>What happens if we don’t reach our financial goal? Basically the cast and crew will receive smaller stipends, and we'll have fewer resources to promote the series. If we exceed our goals, your contribution will be used to ensure that subsequent seasons go into production.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The arc of season one addresses the very real threats that women, people of color, and LGBTQ communities face on a daily basis even here in Colorado. Through humor and strong storytelling, we hope these and other relevant themes will help raise awareness and create a dialogue.</p>
<p>This is about more than just making another webseries. We also want to build the capacity for other untold stories to make it onscreen. We hope our “webseries toolkit” will bolster the ranks of Denver’s content producers.</p>
<p>And through this campaign, we hope to fuel a growing community interested in fostering fun, no-holds-barred storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>What Lies Ahead</strong></p>
<p>There are significant challenges ahead. Distribution is one of the biggest. It’s all well and good to post something on Youtube, but we want to reach a viewership that rivals successful web content produced on the coasts. Here’s how we intend to tackle this issue, with the help of great backers like you.  </p>
<p>Our many years of experience in promotion give us an inside track in harnessing the power of social media platforms like Facebook. We can identify people with specific interests using a wide array of engagement techniques.</p>

</div></div>","The Short Summary
The Mile High Chronicles (MHC) production team has over 50 years of combined experience in television and video production. We realized that important stories unfolding in Denver were being passed over, treated like “flyover country” by the cultural centers on both coasts. The expansion of online and mobile video make cultural centers ubiquitous - they can be anywhere now.
Our aim is to create original, compelling web series that give voice to perspectives that wouldn’t otherwise be seen.
Mile High Chronicles follows Kassandra, a twenty-something visionary with trust issues. A new arrival to the Mile High City after being conned out of a job and a work visa, Kassandra drives for Dryft, an extreme-bargain ride-share service. But her real passion is to create a ground-breaking mobile App. In each four-to-six minute episode, Kassandra comes into contact with colorful local characters - their favorite ""products"" (wink-wink) - and slightly hallucinatory scenes from movie classics.
By the end of the first season, Kassandra will learn that it’s easier - and more fun - to do something important with a group of people you can trust. She’ll also plant the seeds for building IRL community, and help confront a group of violent, Trump-embolden neo-Nazis.
This campaign is critical  not only for raising production funds, but also for bringing Mile High stakeholders into the process. We want to build community by empowering people tell their own stories.

You are part of the Team! A Co-op with Altitude!
Our goal for this campaign is to make sure that actors and crew get at least a small stipend for their hard work on Season One. If we were in New York or Los Angeles, we’d need to raise $30,000. To help our actors pay for babysitters on shoot days, we think $8500 is a reasonable target. And more important than the total number of dollars, we want to identify and grow the number of people in Colorado who are into the idea of supporting local artists - even if the contribution is what you might pay for a ticket at the Multiplex.
We have some amazing perks in exchange for your support, such as subscriptions to our Patreon channel which will include behind the scenes specials.
What happens if we don’t reach our financial goal? Basically the cast and crew will receive smaller stipends, and we'll have fewer resources to promote the series. If we exceed our goals, your contribution will be used to ensure that subsequent seasons go into production.

The Impact
The arc of season one addresses the very real threats that women, people of color, and LGBTQ communities face on a daily basis even here in Colorado. Through humor and strong storytelling, we hope these and other relevant themes will help raise awareness and create a dialogue.
This is about more than just making another webseries. We also want to build the capacity for other untold stories to make it onscreen. We hope our “webseries toolkit” will bolster the ranks of Denver’s content producers.
And through this campaign, we hope to fuel a growing community interested in fostering fun, no-holds-barred storytelling.
What Lies Ahead
There are significant challenges ahead. Distribution is one of the biggest. It’s all well and good to post something on Youtube, but we want to reach a viewership that rivals successful web content produced on the coasts. Here’s how we intend to tackle this issue, with the help of great backers like you.  
Our many years of experience in promotion give us an inside track in harnessing the power of social media platforms like Facebook. We can identify people with specific interests using a wide array of engagement techniques.
We’ve also created partnerships with several local businesses and grassroots groups who share an interest in the topics covered in season one. With their help, we can extend the circle of potential influence-makers and translate that into increased viewership.

<p>We shot the Pilot Episode titled 'WHAT A DAY'... which has now been released. We now need your help to shoot the full season! </p>

<h3>WHY THIS WEBSERIES IS SO IMPORTANT TO US</h3>
<p>We have great hopes for this webseries. With a fun and relatable script that speaks out all of those unexplainable moments we have lived with our flat mates. You know those iconic moments we so badly wish someone had been secretly documenting? We have that (and more) covered.  London, like all big cities, can be a really lonely place and it is our fuzzy flat share experiences that have gotten us through the toughest and best moments. And for those of us who aren't that close to our flatmates this webseries is the perfect reason to have that night in together you have been trying to plan (or avoiding) since like forever! The characters each have unique perks along with great stories to tell. With already 5 episodes written out, we now need your help to bring those to life by donating whatever you can. This will help us secure the next shoot, be able to remunerate the Actors and our amazing Crew, as well as send our webseries to Festivals!</p>

<h3>About the team</h3>
<p>Fat Lucy Films began as a cohort group of professional, student and aspiring film makers as part of the Detroit 48 Hour Film Project. Since then, it has branched out through the midwest, including creators from several major metropolitan areas.  Members of the Fat Lucy Films team have pooled their award-winning experiences from music videos, documentary and short films to help each members visions become a reality.  Now Fat Lucy Films embarks on it's most ambitious project to date - an ongoing series.   The crew of <i>The Adventures of Pammy Van Patton</i> is ever-growing, but here is some info about  it's creator, producers and star:</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Gentner, creator, executive producer, writer</strong></p>
<p>Jen, much like Pammy, is a dreamer. Since she was a little girl she has loved film and television. Her dream of becoming a filmmaker has come true. Jen has been creating short films and music videos over the last decade, but this is her first shot at a comedic series. Pammy Van Patton has been a character that has been floating around in Jen’s head for about 6 years and she decided it was time to share her with the rest of the world. She was very happy to hear the other members of Fat Lucy Films were interested in getting Pammy out there for everyone to see as well. When she isn’t making shorts, Jen enjoys photography, reading graphic novels, scrapbooking, searching for old plastic cameras, and collecting Samuel L. Jackson toys. She has two kids, Gaby and Hayden, 2 dogs, 5 cats (one of which the production company was named after), 2 fish, and 1 fiancé.</p>
<p><strong>Alyse Paquin, Producer</strong></p>
<p>Alyse Paquin has been a part of the local independent film scene in Michigan for several years. She is super excited to be working on a project that just might not involve blood, for once. Comedy and well-developed stories are her passion, and Pammy is the best of both. “When Jen told us about this idea I was immediately on board. I’m so excited to see her vision come to life.”</p>
<p><strong>Gabry Faraj, actor - Pammy Van Patton</strong></p>
<p>Gabry Faraj comes from the prestigious background 'the drama teacher's kid' and embraced life on the stage and independent film projects, until she left Michigan to travel the world. Other than a brief stint of pub theater on the Emerald Isle and local short film projects in Michigan, this is Gabry's return to the screen in a lead role for the first time in four years, which she has embraced with much enthusiasm and excitement. Gabry's hobbies include soccer, cuddling her dog, calligraphy, and exploring. ""I had seen her act in plays years before, and I remember her being really funny.  As soon as she auditioned there, it was unanimous that she was right for the role."" said Alyse. ""She basically is Pammy"" added Jen laughing.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p>As a thank you for your generous donation, perks include social media or in-credit shout-outs, authentic series props, exclusive behind-the-scenes content, extra on-screen parts in an episode(s)  of<i>The Adventures of Pammy Van Patton</i> and even spending a day with Pammy Van Patton herself.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It may sound cliche, but <i>The Adventures of Pammy Van Patton</i> truly is a passion project for the cast and crew involved.  It has been the brain-child of series creator Jennifer Gentner for several years.  With the right creators, cast and crew in place, we feel now is the time bring this project to the light of day, unleash it upon the world and generate as many laughs as we can.</p>

<h2><strong>Hello! Hey! What's up?</strong></h2>
<p>We are Broken Coconuts Productions. A team of comedy loving, self-starting Ryerson University students eager to create something original that boasts Toronto's unique, talented and flourishing comedy scene. Oh ya... and we want it to be *bleep*ing funny.</p>
<p>BleepingFunny 30 minute sketch comedy pilot that consists of five sketches, showcases comedians from across Canada and will be hosted by a local stand-up comedian. The final show will be shot in front of a live studio audience and will pieced together to create a kick*bleep* pilot that will be accessible on a digital platform.</p>
<p>We embarked on production in January, have spent the last 9 months to development and will move into production this fall. In order to make this project come to life we need your help.</p>
<p>Each sketch and the final live studio taping is its own separate production with its own sets, props, costumes, cast and craft services. It's not one production, it's six.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>So order to cover the costs of our production we need to raise $6000. This money will be put towards for things like equipment, transportation, set design, costumes, hair &amp; make up, props and craft services.</p>
<p>We appreciate every penny you are able to donate and we have a few things lined up as our way of saying thanks to all you generous donors.</p>
<h2><strong>It Ain't Easy</strong></h2>
<p>As full time students juggling school, work, internships and the production of a pilot episode, *bleep* gets tricky.

</div><p> </p></div>","Hello! Hey! What's up?
We are Broken Coconuts Productions. A team of comedy loving, self-starting Ryerson University students eager to create something original that boasts Toronto's unique, talented and flourishing comedy scene. Oh ya... and we want it to be *bleep*ing funny.
BleepingFunny 30 minute sketch comedy pilot that consists of five sketches, showcases comedians from across Canada and will be hosted by a local stand-up comedian. The final show will be shot in front of a live studio audience and will pieced together to create a kick*bleep* pilot that will be accessible on a digital platform.
We embarked on production in January, have spent the last 9 months to development and will move into production this fall. In order to make this project come to life we need your help.
Each sketch and the final live studio taping is its own separate production with its own sets, props, costumes, cast and craft services. It's not one production, it's six.
What We Need & What You Get
So order to cover the costs of our production we need to raise $6000. This money will be put towards for things like equipment, transportation, set design, costumes, hair & make up, props and craft services.
We appreciate every penny you are able to donate and we have a few things lined up as our way of saying thanks to all you generous donors.
It Ain't Easy
As full time students juggling school, work, internships and the production of a pilot episode, *bleep* gets tricky. On top of all that, every member of this team has volunteered their time and energy, putting 110% effort and working our *bleep*ing butts because we believe in the success of the show.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you are not able to donate, come out and support the final step of our production, the taping of our LIVE SHOW on November 10th 2018. Check out our Instagram and Facebook @bleepingfunny for updates on our show, details about our fundraisers and a whole *bleep* load of memes.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>PENNYVILLE is a descent into a world of Greek tragedy, Lovecraftian horror, and psychological drama. Poetic, mythical and unrelenting.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">To some, the remains of the desolate hospital have become a fetishist shrine to commemorate the victims. To others - occultists in particular - it is an entrance into another world. A grotesque world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It marks thirty years since a devastating fire killed all the patients and vast majority of the staff at the notorious Pennyville psychiatric hospital. Amongst the patients that perished in the fire was the birth mother of Emily Barker; a young woman struggling to confront her own mental issues who has succumbed to addiction. The recent birth of her daughter has prompted Emily to take a retrospective look into her enigmatic past. Following an investigation into Pennyville, she stumbles upon the asylum's old caretaker: the eerie Jeremy Hobbs. An uneasy alliance will form as Jeremy recounts not only Emily's mother's shocking story but that of the other patients as well, every last disturbing and grim detail, but can Jeremy be trusted? Will Emily discover the truth and be able to save herself or will malevolent forces break her both physically and psychologically?</p>

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>We founded Quint-Essential Creations in 2011, in the early days we focused primarily on producing original horror theatre that was until we moved to Spain in 2014 where our in house writer and director Eli would study filmmaking. In 2015 we shot our first short film <strong>THE TEA PARTY</strong>. THE TEA PARTY had quite an affect on the audiences who experienced it and it went on to win the award of recognition for Best Horror Short at the Hollywood International Moving Pictures Film Festival as well as being selected as a semi-finalist at the American Horror Film Festival.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">""Haunted-house theatre at it's spine chilling best""</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Timeout London, 2013</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508264157/qssvjpnzatzndqmrxih7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Since wrapping THE TEA PARTY we have wanted to push ourselves further and harder then ever before. Due to Eli's love for writing we already had four further short films written and ready to be made but we decided that instead of producing one or two a year then entering them into film festivals we wanted to do something different. We wanted to share our stories with the public in an innovative and original way, that is when the idea for PENNYVILLE was born.</p>
<p>Now it's 2017 and we have already shot 4 of the short films that will feature in PENNYVILLE. We have 5 more short films and the main narrative to shoot and thats where you come in...</p>

<p>Our primary creative goal has always been very simple; ""to entertain and keep people on the edge of their seats"". From the very beginning of Q-E Creations, what we have loved the most is sharing our stories with our audiences and witnessing their reactions first hand. Whether its making you jump out of your seat, retreat in fear, tear up with emotion or shudder in disgust; there is no better thrill for us then seeing how our productions engage and affect humanity. Since moving into film we have started to miss experiencing that organic reaction first hand. By entering THE TEA PARTY into festivals it meant that for a long time we have been unable to share our short film with the public. That's why we chose to create PENNYVILLE, we want to bring our stories straight to the public once more.</p>

<h2>Why PENNYVILLE?</h2>
<p>The world of PENNYVILLE holds a very sacred place in our hearts. In 2011 during the 4 week London tour of our first theatre production THE DARK TALES, the concept for PENNYVILLE was born. Inspired by the demise of the lead character from our short play BLOODY MARY; Eli went on to write a feature film THE ASYLUM (working title). It wasn't until we wrapped shooting on THE TEA PARTY that we decided to re-visit THE ASYLUM script. We knew that due to budget restrictions, making THE ASYLUM feature film was out of our reach. That's when we came up with the idea of creating a web series. To shoot individual short films, which would link together with one main narrative to become a series became a much more effective ambition for us. It wasn't long before we realised we had a very unique project in our hands. After creating the web series, our goal will be to make the PENNYVILLE (THE ASYLUM) feature film, a prequel to the web series. The world of PENNYVILLE is now 6 years in the making, now we invite you to become a part of it's history. </p>

<h2 align=""center""><strong>The Hal Roach Documentary</strong></h2>
<p align=""center"">The Hal Roach Story is an intimate portrait of the legendary mogul and his stars, including Laurel and Hardy &amp; The Little Rascals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Summary </strong></p>
<p>At the turn of the last century, veteran filmmaker Hal Roach moved to Hollywood in search of becoming an actor. By the early 1920’s, Roach found his real calling as a producer and opened the Hal Roach Studios. Roach is featured in the film clip below talking about the early days of Roach Studios, the excerpt taken from a documentary we produced in the late 1980's, hosted by Lauren Bacall.</p>
<p>Over the next three decades, Roach created some of the motion picture industry’s most famous stars. His stable of talent included Laurel and Hardy, Our Gang and the Little Rascals (see clip below). The feature films he produced included such legendary titles as Topper and the original 1 Million BC.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/441881580?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p>The Hal Roach Story features  film clips representing his entire career as well as a number of interviews, including Mr. Roach himself, taken from two interviews with him shot back in 1983. This is an intimate portrait of one of Hollywood’s most successful moguls.  It is the story of how he created his studio, nurtured his legendary talent and even navigated some of Hollywood's darkest scandals, including the Thelma Todd death, seen in the following film clip.</p>

The Hal Roach Story is an intimate portrait of the legendary mogul and his stars, including Laurel and Hardy & The Little Rascals.
 
 
Summary 
At the turn of the last century, veteran filmmaker Hal Roach moved to Hollywood in search of becoming an actor. By the early 1920’s, Roach found his real calling as a producer and opened the Hal Roach Studios. Roach is featured in the film clip below talking about the early days of Roach Studios, the excerpt taken from a documentary we produced in the late 1980's, hosted by Lauren Bacall.
Over the next three decades, Roach created some of the motion picture industry’s most famous stars. His stable of talent included Laurel and Hardy, Our Gang and the Little Rascals (see clip below). The feature films he produced included such legendary titles as Topper and the original 1 Million BC.

 
The Hal Roach Story features  film clips representing his entire career as well as a number of interviews, including Mr. Roach himself, taken from two interviews with him shot back in 1983. This is an intimate portrait of one of Hollywood’s most successful moguls.  It is the story of how he created his studio, nurtured his legendary talent and even navigated some of Hollywood's darkest scandals, including the Thelma Todd death, seen in the following film clip.

<p><strong>Keelyn Klein, a superhero with narcolepsy</strong>, lives in a world where Supers and Primaries (non-superheroes) are widely accepted yet finds herself on the outskirts of society due to her invisible disability. Keelyn has the power to make people dance; narcolepsy IS NOT her power! Unfortunately, few people seem to understand that narcolepsy isn’t solved by drinking coffee.</p>
<p><strong>“Broad City” meets “The Incredibles”</strong> as we follow Keelyn and Lee, her Primary best friend through their day-to-day lives. Lee, always along for the ride in hopes of gaining powers herself, ultimately wants to see Keelyn succeed and help provide some much-needed support. Discover how being labeled “Super” isn’t all it’s cracked up to be and that fighting crime pales in comparison to fighting stereotypes and living up to the standard of an overachieving super-family.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495397164/tmj7zakn5f27yb0js258.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>What is narcolepsy?</strong><br/>For those of you who don't know, narcolepsy is a sleeping disorder characterized by excessive sleepiness, sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and in some cases episodes of cataplexy (partial or total loss of muscle control, often triggered by a strong emotion such as laughter). About 1 in 2,000 people have narcolepsy and only about 25% of the narcoleptic population are properly diagnosed. </p>
<p><br/><strong>An idea is born</strong><br/>One of us, Sarah Albritton, has narcolepsy and isn't shy about it! While day drinking (one of our favorite summer activities), Povs made a comment about how Sarah, being sleepy all the time, would make the worst superhero ever. DING DING DING! Lightbulb goes ON! An idea is born.</p>
<p>We decided to create a comedic, yet relatable character with a misunderstood disorder and portray her in a realistic light. <strong>Narcolepsy, to the best of our knowledge, has not been done realistically on television or in films!</strong> By having someone who has narcolepsy heavily involved in the creative process and playing the role, we plan to rectify that issue. Additionally, we hope this will bring awareness to this disorder which is highly misdiagnosed. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495397888/tdtc2knpamk7m9an8aqa.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Let’s introduce us!</strong> We are Sarah Albritton and Catherine “Povs” Povinelli. We’re comedians and friends who met on the Chicago scene and have embarked on this crazy-fun journey to bring narcolepsy awareness through our comedic web series Super Narcoleptic Girl. We've cultivated this baby from a drunken idea to written scripts to a full-fledged web series production. Our characters are (very)  loosely based on ourselves and Keelyn and Lee's friendship mirrors our own.</p>

<p>Though Keelyn’s Super name is Super Narcoleptic Girl, her power is to make people dance. Her Super name was given to her by mistake and she’s unable to change it, much like living with narcolepsy is out of her control. Ultimately, she doesn’t want to be defined by her disability. <strong>Creating a comedic character that brings awareness to narcolepsy, gives a voice not only to that community but to anyone who feels different, disability or not</strong>.</p>

<p>Lee is Keelyn’s quirky best friend and roommate with a lack of boundaries. Though a Primary (without powers), she is fascinated with superhero life and is constantly trying to become a Super by any means necessary. Lee constantly steals Keelyn’s uniform, medication, and food. By all counts she is a terrible roommate, but seems to be the only one Keelyn can live with. <strong>She’s the only one who really understands how narcolepsy affects Keelyn and doesn’t judge her by it. </strong>Lee is a genuine and loyal friend who would take a bullet for Keelyn...at least in a non-vital area.</p>

<p>A lot of people will say the industry is over-saturated with superheroes…but you know what else is over saturated?<strong> Water. And we all NEED water…just like superheroes.</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few, out of many good reasons why:</p>
<ol>
<li>They’re awesome.</li>
<li>Our lead character, Keelyn Klein, is not defined by her disability; she has the power to make people dance, that’s her POWER, not narcolepsy!  And constantly battles the stereotypes associated with her disorder. This is meant to parallel how people with narcolepsy are viewed and often misunderstood.</li>
<li>Our world has superheroes AND primaries (non-supers). We wanted to create an atmosphere where individuals co-exist, and can constantly ask questions about one another.</li>
<li>If Keelyn’s power is to make people dance, why is she called Super Narcoleptic Girl? You’re just going to have to watch the web series to find out!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>At the end of the day, our web series is based in a fictional realm but deals with very real issues</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Our Goal: </strong>5,000 for 10 3-5 minute episodes</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal:</strong> $7,000</p>
<p>We have a team of talented, dedicated professionals who deserve a well-funded project. We're raising $5,000 to help pay for equipment rentals, locations, cast &amp; crew members, and production costs. We’re smart and savvy with finances, so check out our pie chart because everyone loves pie:</p>

<p>Your contribution, regardless of amount, will be highly valued and used to create something truly unique. “Save the day, stay awake,” might be the web series’ slogan, but for donations, it’s “Save the pennies, Stay in Production.”</p>

</div></div>","Keelyn Klein, a superhero with narcolepsy, lives in a world where Supers and Primaries (non-superheroes) are widely accepted yet finds herself on the outskirts of society due to her invisible disability. Keelyn has the power to make people dance; narcolepsy IS NOT her power! Unfortunately, few people seem to understand that narcolepsy isn’t solved by drinking coffee.
“Broad City” meets “The Incredibles” as we follow Keelyn and Lee, her Primary best friend through their day-to-day lives. Lee, always along for the ride in hopes of gaining powers herself, ultimately wants to see Keelyn succeed and help provide some much-needed support. Discover how being labeled “Super” isn’t all it’s cracked up to be and that fighting crime pales in comparison to fighting stereotypes and living up to the standard of an overachieving super-family.

What is narcolepsy?For those of you who don't know, narcolepsy is a sleeping disorder characterized by excessive sleepiness, sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and in some cases episodes of cataplexy (partial or total loss of muscle control, often triggered by a strong emotion such as laughter). About 1 in 2,000 people have narcolepsy and only about 25% of the narcoleptic population are properly diagnosed. 
An idea is bornOne of us, Sarah Albritton, has narcolepsy and isn't shy about it! While day drinking (one of our favorite summer activities), Povs made a comment about how Sarah, being sleepy all the time, would make the worst superhero ever. DING DING DING! Lightbulb goes ON! An idea is born.
We decided to create a comedic, yet relatable character with a misunderstood disorder and portray her in a realistic light. Narcolepsy, to the best of our knowledge, has not been done realistically on television or in films! By having someone who has narcolepsy heavily involved in the creative process and playing the role, we plan to rectify that issue. Additionally, we hope this will bring awareness to this disorder which is highly misdiagnosed. 

Let’s introduce us! We are Sarah Albritton and Catherine “Povs” Povinelli. We’re comedians and friends who met on the Chicago scene and have embarked on this crazy-fun journey to bring narcolepsy awareness through our comedic web series Super Narcoleptic Girl. We've cultivated this baby from a drunken idea to written scripts to a full-fledged web series production. Our characters are (very)  loosely based on ourselves and Keelyn and Lee's friendship mirrors our own.

 
Keelyn Klein aka Super Narcoleptic Girl - Sarah Albritton

Though Keelyn’s Super name is Super Narcoleptic Girl, her power is to make people dance. Her Super name was given to her by mistake and she’s unable to change it, much like living with narcolepsy is out of her control. Ultimately, she doesn’t want to be defined by her disability. Creating a comedic character that brings awareness to narcolepsy, gives a voice not only to that community but to anyone who feels different, disability or not.
 

Friendlee “Lee” Snow  - Catherine “ Povs ” Povinelli


Lee is Keelyn’s quirky best friend and roommate with a lack of boundaries. Though a Primary (without powers), she is fascinated with superhero life and is constantly trying to become a Super by any means necessary. Lee constantly steals Keelyn’s uniform, medication, and food. By all counts she is a terrible roommate, but seems to be the only one Keelyn can live with. She’s the only one who really understands how narcolepsy affects Keelyn and doesn’t judge her by it. Lee is a genuine and loyal friend who would take a bullet for Keelyn...at least in a non-vital area.

A lot of people will say the industry is over-saturated with superheroes…but you know what else is over saturated? Water. And we all NEED water…just like superheroes.
Here are a few, out of many good reasons why:

They’re awesome.
Our lead character, Keelyn Klein, is not defined by her disability; she has the power to make people dance, that’s her POWER, not narcolepsy!  And constantly battles the stereotypes associated with her disorder. This is meant to parallel how people with narcolepsy are viewed and often misunderstood.
Our world has superheroes AND primaries (non-supers). We wanted to create an atmosphere where individuals co-exist, and can constantly ask questions about one another.
If Keelyn’s power is to make people dance, why is she called Super Narcoleptic Girl? You’re just going to have to watch the web series to find out!

At the end of the day, our web series is based in a fictional realm but deals with very real issues.

Our Goal: 5,000 for 10 3-5 minute episodes
Stretch Goal: $7,000
We have a team of talented, dedicated professionals who deserve a well-funded project. We're raising $5,000 to help pay for equipment rentals, locations, cast & crew members, and production costs. We’re smart and savvy with finances, so check out our pie chart because everyone loves pie:

Your contribution, regardless of amount, will be highly valued and used to create something truly unique. “Save the day, stay awake,” might be the web series’ slogan, but for donations, it’s “Save the pennies, Stay in Production.”

Even $10 goes a long way to help us reach our goal, but if you can't participate financially; you can still help us spread the word!

You can also get the word out to your friends and family about SUPER NARCOLEPTIC GIRL by using the Indiegogo share tools up & to the right.
If you live in Chicago or the Greater Area and want to donate a service or your time, give us a shout! Services might include but are not limited to equipment, props, food, locations, crew assistance, etc…You can also help support narcolepsy awareness through wonderful organizations like Narcolepsy Network, National Sleep Foundation and Project Sleep.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’m award winning actor and filmmaker George Zouvelos, and I have created and written ‘Spyros Yeeros’ a hilariously funny sitcom about a traditional Greek American family of gastronomical experts led by Spyro who publicly, but reluctantly rises  to the top of New York City's restaurant scene and national renown.. Spyro was  crowned  ‘Gyro King USA’,  by Americas top food critics, as he and his family comprised of the hilarious cast of comedians and actors confront through interactions customers the modern times we live in.</p>
<p>Spyro only wants to make sandwiches and good food and desserts. Unlike his other family members brothers and sisters that work along with him Spyro is not interested in the traditional ways of Greek thanking; especially in his choice of finding a future non Greek wife.</p>
<p>The show responsibly highlights the respect for the caring differences in opinions, and from every generational, ethnic, political, religious and personal preferential societal aspect, and conscienceness, as the stories filter by the diverse customers who dine in the gyros shop, and frequent the Gyro food trucks that operate across New York City. </p>
<p>We are seeking to film the pilot episodes with sizzle reel and trailers in order to bring to market through a show runner. I was able to secure initial sweat equity commitments from the actors, as we apply for the SAG Aftra low budget contractual agreement.</p>
<p>The show is important to us as it will demonstrate how the sons and daughters of immigrants, all with varying personalities and genders,  were able to get educated, but have all chosen to return and pursue the love and expertise of the gastronomical excellence of the Hellenic Greek family cooking That they offered to the public made with love and the best ingredients.</p>
<p>The funds will be utilized for legal, actual  production, post production, including sound color and scene editing. Additionally, hair make up and props, in addition to travel, lodging, food, refreshments, equipment, wardrobe, coronavirus Coordinator, festivals, advertising, and every aspect to  be fully compliant with the SAG agreement.</p>
</div><div>
<p>All the funds raised here will be to secure this production for as far as we can take it. If we are blessed to have the funds that we need as described below being 85,000 to operate without any further fundraising for the initial filming. In the alternative, $50,000 and then we will have to focus on additional fundraising to reach our goal.</p>
<p>In life nothing is a guaranteed, however through extensive outreach, and the presentation of the treatment to industry experts, in addition to the comedians and actors who have agreed to work on the sweat equity we believe we have more than a decent chance of succeeding with production, post production and publishing to sell for distribution. If you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me as we are fully transparent seeking only to provide entertainment that is responsible and is able to highlight today’s diverse and very difficult social environments in our nation. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Prologue</h3>
<p>Growing up as a Filipino-American male, you get asked two questions at family functions: ""How's school?"" and ""Who's your girlfriend now?"" It was probably meant to be cute small talk but my young male brain took this very seriously. I didn't want to be a fraud so I NEEDED to have an impressive girlfriend! I didn't actually get a girlfriend until college and that  was quite the roller coaster with high highs and low lows. When it ended, I didn't know who I was. I was lonely and my self-esteem took a hit. So I spent a few years reading self-help articles and trying to find my confidence. One day I read an article that said ""to be confident, make confident decisions."" ""Of course!"" I thought, ""Confident men don't spend time sulking in their apartment. Confident men are out there being f*ckboys""</p>
<p>My name is Chris Paul Morales and I'm a New York based Actor and Producer. ""Fuggboi Dave"" is my fourth venture as a producer. This series (inspired by real life events) is meant to explore the effects of toxic relationships and toxic masculinity through an Asian-American lens. The personal experiences that inspired this series were lonely and confusing. The more I spoke about it with others, the more I realized I wasn't alone. If this series can make one person feel like they are not alone, then I would've accomplished exactly what I set out to do.</p>

<h3>A Cell Phone Symphony: Pilot Episode</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm Michael Johnson a New York Film Academy student in my final semester, after serving in the US Army I came to NYFA to follow my dream of being a film maker, now that the learning part is almost over i'm getting ready to close the book on that chapter of my life.</p>
<p>This campaign is very important to me because I've dedicated the last few years of my life just to reach this moment, it comes full circle with everything i've learned as a student. Film making is no easy task but neither is anything else in life so I hope to inspire someone to follow their dreams no matter how impossible it seems.</p>
<p>With the donations and support from you and others, I'll be able to tell a funny story that will take people away from the work for just a few minutes, and if all goes well I can continue telling more stories after this project. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>$1,000, this money will go towards</p>
<ul>
<li>Set Design, to create a full vibrate world for you to see surrounding the actors.</li>
<li>Location fee and permits, because in LA you can't shoot anything without the proper paper work.</li>
<li>Feeding Cast and Crew, to give a great performance everyone will need their energy.</li>
<li>If we're unable to reach our goal the film will be shot anyway but the script will have to change to fit the budget.</li>

<h3>Why <i>Queen's English</i> Exists:</h3>
<p><i>Queen’s English</i> is a gay web series about some messy queens just trying to make it to adulthood in one piece—with some money left over for Sunday mimosas.<br/> <br/>Written and created by Tyler Dwiggins, <i>Queen’s English</i> follows Gabe, a wayward twink whose Catholic boyfriend just dumped him for Jesus; Tucker, who definitely just locked himself out of the apartment—in full drag; and Olivia, an actress who will probably become a star just after she cleans the ketchup off her shoes. Think <i>Girls</i> or <i>Insecure</i> got thrown in a blender with a splash of Fireball whiskey and a handful of glitter.</p>
<p>In spite of so much progress, gay characters on TV still often slot into very stereotypical categories: a wacky sidekick, a tragic hero, a sexy diversity quota. We are not sidekicks. We are the main characters of our own hilarious stories. And those stories are universal. </p>
<p><i>Queen’s English</i> focuses on LGBT characters, but it’s really about the landmine in between childhood and adulthood. The main characters struggle with love, lust, and an empty checking account – just like you!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help:</h3>
<p>Simply put, we need your help to film the rest of the episodes in season one! We are so proud of the work we’ve done so far, and we want to continue telling this story.</p>
<p>We could not have created this project without the hard work of our cast and crew who have worked for free because they believe in the project. In order to keep <i>Queen’s English</i> in motion, we need your support.</p>

<h3>O Hai!</h3>
<p>My name is Juliet Johnston aka (Sparky)<br/>And I've been making fursuits for the past seven years.<br/>You can check out my website <a href=""http://www.sparkycando.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> for more info on that!</p>
<p>Anyway! Are you looking for EXPERT tutorial videos on how to make your very own AMAZING fursuits?<br/>""cups mouth and yells (HELL YEAH) like it came from someone else""<br/>Then 'O' boy are you in for a treat!<br/>I'm really excited about making a ten part tutorial series on fursuit building, from patterns, trimming fur, digigrade legs, moving jaws and foam carving! It'll all be here to make getting into fursuit building an easier, less daunting process for those just starting out.<br/>Even experienced builders may find new tricks and tips along the way!<br/>Each episode will be around half an hour so the whole series will be at least five hours long, if not, definitely more! (I often get carried away hehe)<br/><br/>Making your own fursuit is a great way of getting into and experiencing the furry fandom, especially if you're on a budget. It's super fun to learn something new and see your progress get better and better with each new project!<br/>(Not to mention the bragging rights when people ask you, who made your suit?!)<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get =D</h3>
<p>I'll be needing $7000USD to make this series as I'm going to take a whole month off my normal fursuit making work and focus only on this series. I'll have my friend and helper, Maria, working on this project too, so will be funding her wages during this time also.<br/><br/>For this fundraiser's running time only you can get this whole series for $35USD<br/>After the series is made I'll be selling it retail for $50USD, that's a whole 30% discount off for you right now PLUS I'll be added all my backers name or ""nickname"" in the credits and do a lil special dance for you all as a big thank you! <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges &amp; Goals!</h3>
<p>I've always loved making videos but with all my current work it's been really hard to find time to make high quality tutorials, I've been skimming by with a few ""how to"" videos on my YouTube channel <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/WarningSparkyBites/featured?view_as=subscriber"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WarningSparkyBites</a> but they have been low budget and not very well thought out, even though I get many comments from fans saying they love them, I know I can do so much better for you guys!<br/> </p>

<h3>Spread the bird! I mean word...</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute this time around you can still help out greatly!!!<br/>By spreading the word, retweeting, sharing and harassing yo friends who may be interested!<br/>You can use the Indiegogo share tools too!<br/> </p>

<h3><strong>RACE FOR THE TOP </strong></h3>
<p>RACE FOR THE TOP (#RACE4TT) is the first reality TV series that highlights the crowdfunding heroes (you), the entrepreneurs, and their businesses that rely on crowdfunding to make their dreams a reality.</p>
<p>The show is a collaborative effort between e360tv and our partners: award-winning production company NBTV Studios, crowdfunding community kulaBrands, and several media distributors. Featuring host Jeff Hoffman, serial entrepreneur from Priceline.com, Ubid.com, co-founder kulaBrands, and other renowned companies. We will explore the stories of the incredible people involved in the crowfunding movement, their journeys, and the unparalleled resolve it takes to succeed. It's a production with broadcast quality that rivals Shark Tank and The Profit.</p>
<p>Race For The Top is a view in the world of entrepreneurship lifestyle and the challenges that accompany that lifestyle. “It’s a breed of people that would rather work 80 hours for themselves than 40 hours for others”. The Race For The Top series explores start-ups before, during and after their crowdfunding campaigns. The show highlights the companies, their products and most importantly, the people. Audiences get insights of the struggles, the pull on family life and the emotional roller-coaster that accompanies the entrepreneurial lifestyle, especially when launching a new company.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS THE BACKGROUND OF RACE FOR THE TOP?</strong>   </p>
<p>Supporting RACE FOR THE TOP is a phenomenal opportunity to help highlight the effects of crowdfunding in the success of entrepreneurs and the value that this activity has been able to create over the past eight years. RACE FOR THE TOP will showcase the effort, struggles, celebrations and the victories, for the crowdfunding entrepreneurs that you are supporting as they stake their futures on the success of their projects.  You will get an inside view of what it takes to create, run, and fulfill on a campaign's promises. This show not only highlights those that dare to dream but also, amplifies the crowdfunding movement through modern, digital media. THE MORE SUPPORT WE RECEIVE, THE MORE EPISODES WE CAN PRODUCE AND THE MORE PROJECTS WE CAN HIGHLIGHT AS THEY ARE ""RACING FOR THE TOP""!</p>
<p>According to MIT Professor Eric von Hippel, ""crowd funding is an important contributor to the democratization of innovation – the biggest paradigm shift in innovation since the Industrial Revolution.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>FUNDING GOALS AND TIMELINE </strong> </p>
<p>The funding threshold of $40,000 is our first step towards achieving our goal of breaking ground on the first episode of RACE FOR THE TOP. Normally, a production like this will cost $60,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce. However, the partners and contractors we’ve brought together for this project are putting their time and resources into the first episodes of RACE FOR THE TOP at no charge or a reduced rate because they believe in the vision and the philosophy of crowdfunding to help entrepreneurs change the world for the better.   </p>
<p>Upon reaching our funding goal, we will go right into our pre-production phase that will entail picking locations and the companies that will be highlighted in each episode. Shortly after, we move into the production phase that includes coordinating the companies and characters for each episode and filming the episode(s). Next, we move into post-production phase that includes editing the footage and adding interactive overlays that will bring the episodes to life! Lastly, we add to the e360tv show line-up and via social and digital advertising networks, we promote and market the show to millions.  </p>
<p>Our potential audience is 12-15 million!</p>

<h3>Hey hi what's up it's me Adam Reines!! </h3>
<p>I made an Indiegogo! That's this. You're here right now reading it.</p>
<p>I'm 22, from New Jersey, I'm an actor, writer and barista (shocking.) So, here's a little background regarding this project. I started writing the pilot episode to this project in March of 2016. It was going well, until I put it on hiatus due to the fact that I was too depressed to write, let alone leave my bed on most days. I was that depressed when I started writing it as well, but it got worse. From 2014 to January 2017, I was on and off suicidal.</p>
<p>However, through hard, hard work in therapy and finding the right medication for me, I haven't had a genuine suicidal thought since January. I finished writing the pilot episode a month ago from posting this, and I am excited, eager, and hungry for this to get made. This story is a super important and valuable story to share with the world and I know that it will do nothing but good.</p>
<p>Dust is not about me. The main message of this story is to exercise empathy, it teaches you how to get over emotional roadblocks no matter how severe they are, and it teaches how to deal with your internal demons. All with a healthy dose of dark comedic relief. You'll feel uncomfortable as fuck, you'll cry, your heart will warm, and most importantly, you'll laugh.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why I'm asking for money</h3>
<p>Right. So. Why should you donate your hard-earned cash to lil' ol' me. Here are some reasons (holy shit I'm so bad at this):</p>
<ol>
<li>I have a full production team of professionals and people who work in the industry working on this with me. I would like to pay them. I have my director and two other crew members flying in from LA (I live in NJ) and I would like to pay for their food and hotel. As for the others, they are taking time off from their jobs to work on this with me for 6 days. I would also like to compensate them, as this means way much more to me than words can express and they'd be missing out on funds from work. </li>
<li>We are shooting after-hours at a deli for two-three days for this shoot. I know the owner would also appreciate some compensation, as they'd be running the electricity for longer than they usually do, and we will be using the equipment in the kitchen, sucking up precious electricity. </li>
<li>Paying for miscellaneous items; such as props. I have a good graphic designer friend of mine who will be making some posters and labels for props (she doesn't know this yet, actually, but hi Jacqui xoxo) and I would like to compensate her for that as well. Promotional stills, advertisements, editing, and everything post-production will be handled by friends of mine. These donations are more-so going to everyone else besides me. </li>
<li>Any left over funds from this campaign would go towards shooting the rest of the episodes, which I will also try to fund through Indiegogo. Due to the fact that I'm not an established actor in the industry, it will be harder to shoot the rest of the episodes. Unless this gets picked up by a network. (I'm looking DIRECTLY at you, Netflix.) ((also Hulu)) (((also literally any network in the entire world ok))) If it doesn't get picked up, they will come out between relatively large gaps of time. I have two out of the six written, and the other four I have completely planned out plot-wise in my records.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As I mentioned previously, this campaign is only for the pilot episode. Any leftover funds from this Indiegogo will be saved for shooting the other episodes. Like I said, as an unknown nobody in the acting world, it is very hard to shoot an entire miniseries solely off of one campaign, especially when your director lives 3,000 miles away. However, the rest will be made. That is the only challenge I am facing in terms of the whole project. In terms of the pilot, the only challenge is compensating everyone :) </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't swing donating to this campaign, that is a-okay. Believe me, I understand. I'm a broke-ass. Yesterday, all I ate was a bowl of cereal. I'm on my state's health insurance. 65% of my wardrobe consists of things I've had since senior year of high school. But you can help in a free kind of way. </p>
<p>Please share this Indiegogo. That's all I ask. Maybe write a lil post with it about how gr8 this seems/how gr8 I am and that's it. Or don't. Honestly do whatever you want. Go watch youtube. Actually, watch this video; It's hilarious: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYc4DT18EJg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYc4DT18EJg</a></p>
</div></div>","Hey hi what's up it's me Adam Reines!! 
I made an Indiegogo! That's this. You're here right now reading it.
I'm 22, from New Jersey, I'm an actor, writer and barista (shocking.) So, here's a little background regarding this project. I started writing the pilot episode to this project in March of 2016. It was going well, until I put it on hiatus due to the fact that I was too depressed to write, let alone leave my bed on most days. I was that depressed when I started writing it as well, but it got worse. From 2014 to January 2017, I was on and off suicidal.
However, through hard, hard work in therapy and finding the right medication for me, I haven't had a genuine suicidal thought since January. I finished writing the pilot episode a month ago from posting this, and I am excited, eager, and hungry for this to get made. This story is a super important and valuable story to share with the world and I know that it will do nothing but good.
Dust is not about me. The main message of this story is to exercise empathy, it teaches you how to get over emotional roadblocks no matter how severe they are, and it teaches how to deal with your internal demons. All with a healthy dose of dark comedic relief. You'll feel uncomfortable as fuck, you'll cry, your heart will warm, and most importantly, you'll laugh.  

Why I'm asking for money
Right. So. Why should you donate your hard-earned cash to lil' ol' me. Here are some reasons (holy shit I'm so bad at this):

I have a full production team of professionals and people who work in the industry working on this with me. I would like to pay them. I have my director and two other crew members flying in from LA (I live in NJ) and I would like to pay for their food and hotel. As for the others, they are taking time off from their jobs to work on this with me for 6 days. I would also like to compensate them, as this means way much more to me than words can express and they'd be missing out on funds from work. 
We are shooting after-hours at a deli for two-three days for this shoot. I know the owner would also appreciate some compensation, as they'd be running the electricity for longer than they usually do, and we will be using the equipment in the kitchen, sucking up precious electricity. 
Paying for miscellaneous items; such as props. I have a good graphic designer friend of mine who will be making some posters and labels for props (she doesn't know this yet, actually, but hi Jacqui xoxo) and I would like to compensate her for that as well. Promotional stills, advertisements, editing, and everything post-production will be handled by friends of mine. These donations are more-so going to everyone else besides me. 
Any left over funds from this campaign would go towards shooting the rest of the episodes, which I will also try to fund through Indiegogo. Due to the fact that I'm not an established actor in the industry, it will be harder to shoot the rest of the episodes. Unless this gets picked up by a network. (I'm looking DIRECTLY at you, Netflix.) ((also Hulu)) (((also literally any network in the entire world ok))) If it doesn't get picked up, they will come out between relatively large gaps of time. I have two out of the six written, and the other four I have completely planned out plot-wise in my records. Aka I know exactly everything that happens in the series and exactly what will happen.
And lastly, it might make you feel good to help make someone's dream come true. This is my dream. Not fame. Not money. But being able to put together a piece of art that will actually benefit the public. To create something that will effect people's lives in a positive way. To get people thinking in a way they normally wouldn't. To make people feel. To make people laugh.

<h2><strong>What Is It?</strong></h2> <p>States of Perception: Body Image is a digital series that will focus on telling 50 unique, diverse stories from 50 different states across the United States of America. Each episode will be between under 10 minutes, feature 1 story from a specific state, and will be released across online platforms when editing is finished. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563501561/bcqqpjmgqotpuvgosxnm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As social media has expanded in reach, more and more people are sharing their stories related to body image online. States of Perception: Body Image will help expand the reach of these stories in a way that is digitally consumable and short-form based. </p> <h2><strong>Why Does This Project Matter?</strong></h2> <p>Body image impacts everyone, whether it’s through the media we consume, the people we follow on social media, or the way we view ourselves in private and public. Even though everyone in the world has a story related to body image, we only see a limited scope of these stories represented when we watch tv or when we scroll on Instagram. </p> <p>By highlighting 50 diverse stories across the USA, we hope the series will open people’s eyes to what body positivity and body neutrality means, and help reduce stigma surrounding eating disorders, lower rates of fat-shaming and gender stereotypes related to weight, and allow people to feel more comfortable being their authentic selves. The series will tackle topics including body positivity vs body neutrality, fat phobia, privileges related to weight and image, social injustices associated with eating disorders and body image, narratives around all body types, narratives surrounding solutions to the stigmatization of body image, efforts to increase inclusive representation in mainstream media, modeling, and fashion, and potentially treatment options and highlights surrounding healing centers. </p> <h2><strong>How Did This All Start?</strong></h2> <p>After meeting at a National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA) Walk, award-winning director Alec Fischer and NEDA Ambassador Ryan Sheldon met and bonded over the concept for a series addressing what body image means to people across the United States. Putting together Fischer’s experience creating documentaries and Sheldon’s experience as a body-positivity advocate seemed like a perfect match; thus States of Perception: Body Image was born!</p> <h2><strong>Meet the Team:</strong></h2> <p><strong>Alec Fischer (@FischrMedia): Co-Producer, Director, Editor</strong></p>

<p>At age 17, Alec created a documentary based on the 2011 suicide epidemic in Minnesota Public Schools that was shown in schools across the world, garnering him international attention. In college he was named a Dalai Lama Fellow, collected 115k+ signatures to ban the practice of conversion therapy on minors, &amp; spoke to 15k+ students across the Midwest about creating safe school environments. He’s been featured in publications including USA Today, The HuffPost, Buzzfeed, MTV, and The Washington Times.</p> <p><strong>Ryan Sheldon (@BingeEaterConfessions): Co-Producer, Host</strong></p>

<p>A motivational speaker and brawn model, Ryan has been educating audiences about body image and binge eating disorder since his own diagnosis in 2015. Passionate about raising awareness of binge eating and body image issues as an Ambassador for the National Eating Disorders Association, he has shared his story with the Today Show, Huffington Post, Seventeen Magazine, and Teen Vogue, among other outlets. Ryan also speaks to teens about masculinity, identity, and body confidence. He is currently working on a book about his and other men's experiences learning to eat mindfully and love themselves just as they are. </p> <h2><strong>If You Raise The Money, What Will Happen?</strong></h2> <p>If we raise the $50,000 goal budget, we’ll be able to take a road trip across the United States and film an episode in each state we visit! If we fall short of our goal, then we’ll cut down the amount of states we visit based on the funding we’re able to raise. </p> <p><strong>Here’s a rough timeline if we raise the entire amount of our goal:</strong></p> <p>September 2019: Campaign Launch!</p>
<p>October 2019: Campaign Closes</p>
<p>November - April 2020: Pre-Production (Episode Planning, Travel Prep, Etc)</p>

<p>October 2020 - January 2021: Post Production</p>
<p>Early 2021: Series Premiere</p> <h2><strong>What Will The Money Go Towards?</strong></h2> <p>Here’s what the $50,000 will go towards: </p> <p>40% - Airbnb Rental Costs</p>
<p>25% - Gas &amp; Car Rental Fees</p>
<p>15% - Food Costs</p>
<p>10% - Camera Equipment</p>
<p>5% -  Emergency Fund/Backup Funding</p>
<p>5% - Indiegogo Costs</p> <p>If we reach our initial goal then the budget shifts to this breakdown for every dollar raised after $50,000:</p> <p>25% - Editor/Color Correction</p>
<p>25% - Producer Compensation</p>
<p>20% - Director Compensation</p>
<p>10% - Re-Shoot Budget</p>

</div></div>","What Is It? States of Perception: Body Image is a digital series that will focus on telling 50 unique, diverse stories from 50 different states across the United States of America. Each episode will be between under 10 minutes, feature 1 story from a specific state, and will be released across online platforms when editing is finished. 
 

 
As social media has expanded in reach, more and more people are sharing their stories related to body image online. States of Perception: Body Image will help expand the reach of these stories in a way that is digitally consumable and short-form based.  Why Does This Project Matter? Body image impacts everyone, whether it’s through the media we consume, the people we follow on social media, or the way we view ourselves in private and public. Even though everyone in the world has a story related to body image, we only see a limited scope of these stories represented when we watch tv or when we scroll on Instagram.  By highlighting 50 diverse stories across the USA, we hope the series will open people’s eyes to what body positivity and body neutrality means, and help reduce stigma surrounding eating disorders, lower rates of fat-shaming and gender stereotypes related to weight, and allow people to feel more comfortable being their authentic selves. The series will tackle topics including body positivity vs body neutrality, fat phobia, privileges related to weight and image, social injustices associated with eating disorders and body image, narratives around all body types, narratives surrounding solutions to the stigmatization of body image, efforts to increase inclusive representation in mainstream media, modeling, and fashion, and potentially treatment options and highlights surrounding healing centers.  How Did This All Start? After meeting at a National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA) Walk, award-winning director Alec Fischer and NEDA Ambassador Ryan Sheldon met and bonded over the concept for a series addressing what body image means to people across the United States. Putting together Fischer’s experience creating documentaries and Sheldon’s experience as a body-positivity advocate seemed like a perfect match; thus States of Perception: Body Image was born! Meet the Team: Alec Fischer (@FischrMedia): Co-Producer, Director, Editor

At age 17, Alec created a documentary based on the 2011 suicide epidemic in Minnesota Public Schools that was shown in schools across the world, garnering him international attention. In college he was named a Dalai Lama Fellow, collected 115k+ signatures to ban the practice of conversion therapy on minors, & spoke to 15k+ students across the Midwest about creating safe school environments. He’s been featured in publications including USA Today, The HuffPost, Buzzfeed, MTV, and The Washington Times. Ryan Sheldon (@BingeEaterConfessions): Co-Producer, Host

A motivational speaker and brawn model, Ryan has been educating audiences about body image and binge eating disorder since his own diagnosis in 2015. Passionate about raising awareness of binge eating and body image issues as an Ambassador for the National Eating Disorders Association, he has shared his story with the Today Show, Huffington Post, Seventeen Magazine, and Teen Vogue, among other outlets. Ryan also speaks to teens about masculinity, identity, and body confidence. He is currently working on a book about his and other men's experiences learning to eat mindfully and love themselves just as they are.  If You Raise The Money, What Will Happen? If we raise the $50,000 goal budget, we’ll be able to take a road trip across the United States and film an episode in each state we visit! If we fall short of our goal, then we’ll cut down the amount of states we visit based on the funding we’re able to raise.  Here’s a rough timeline if we raise the entire amount of our goal: September 2019: Campaign Launch!
October 2019: Campaign Closes
November - April 2020: Pre-Production (Episode Planning, Travel Prep, Etc)
May - June 2020: 1st Half of Production (West Coast + Southern States)
July 2020: Post-Production Begins on 1st Half of Series
August - September 2020: 2nd Half of Production (Midwest + East Coast + Mountain Regions)
October 2020 - January 2021: Post Production
Early 2021: Series Premiere What Will The Money Go Towards? Here’s what the $50,000 will go towards:  40% - Airbnb Rental Costs
25% - Gas & Car Rental Fees
15% - Food Costs
10% - Camera Equipment
5% -  Emergency Fund/Backup Funding
5% - Indiegogo Costs If we reach our initial goal then the budget shifts to this breakdown for every dollar raised after $50,000: 25% - Editor/Color Correction
25% - Producer Compensation
20% - Director Compensation
10% - Re-Shoot Budget
10% - Music Licensing
5% - NEDA (National Editing Disorder Association) Donation
5% - Indiegogo Costs How Can I Get Involved?? YAY! We love that you want to get involved with the project!

<u><strong>WHAT IS SCARY SLEEPOVER</strong></u>?</h3><p>Adam Green's SCARY SLEEPOVER is an on-line reality series that features some of the biggest names in genre entertainment like you've never seen them before... in their pajamas! In each episode a different celebrity artist joins filmmaker Adam Green (HATCHET, FROZEN) for a slumber party at his studio where they spend the night playing games, watching movies, eating junk food, and having extremely candid conversations that reveal their biggest real life fears. To date the 29 existing episodes have been watched over 1 million times between ArieScope.com and ArieScope's YouTube channel. <br/><br/>It was Green's goal in creating SCARY SLEEPOVER to not only entertain audiences but to provide a true connection between artists and fans. While the show may be inherently funny and contain some truly hilarious moments, it is also bursting with genuine <i>heart</i> due to each guest's personal relationship with Green and how comfortable they are opening up about themselves so honestly. Through its many emotional and revealing moments SCARY SLEEPOVER has given fans a much deeper look at <i>who</i> these artists really are and just how much we all truly have in common as a community. </p><h3>
<u><strong>THE GUESTS SO FAR</strong></u>:</h3><p>Previous guests have include: Slash (GUNS N ROSES), Sid Haig (THE DEVIL'S REJECTS), Kane Hodder (FRIDAY THE 13TH), Danielle Harris (HALLOWEEN), Dee Snider (TWISTED SISTER), Derek Mears (SWAMP THING), Bill Moseley (THE DEVIL'S REJECTS), Emma Bell (THE WALKING DEAD), Tony Todd (CANDYMAN), Joe Lynch (MAYHEM), Brea Grant (DEXTER), Felissa Rose (SLEEPAWAY CAMP), Neil Marshall (GAME OF THRONES), Ti West (HOUSE OF THE DEVIL), Kristina Klebe (HALLOWEEN), Lucky McKee (MAY), Clare Kramer (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER), Todd Farmer (MY BLOODY VALENTINE), Tiffany Shepis (VICTOR CROWLEY), Tom Holland (CHILD'S PLAY), Laura Ortiz (HOLLISTON), Darren Lynn Bousman (SAW), Zach Galligan (GREMLINS), and Jeffrey Reddick (FINAL DESTINATION).</p><h3>
<u><strong>THE HISTORY OF SCARY SLEEPOVER</strong></u>:</h3><p>Adam Green's SCARY SLEEPOVER originally ran from 2015 - 2017. Full-length uncensored versions of episodes ran on ArieScope.com while ArieScope's YouTube Channel carried shortened versions. The show was (and remains) free to watch no matter which platform you watched it on.  As beloved as the series may have become, unfortunately our model of making the show with our own money and giving it away to fans for free eventually took its toll on us. Producing the show was taking up all of our time and we were sinking further and further into debt the longer we worked on it. So it was with a heavy heart that we had to roll up our sleeping bags and say goodnight to the slumber parties. <br/><br/>The amount of work that goes into producing an episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER is on par with an episode of any network television reality show - only we were doing it without a budget of any kind whatsoever.  Not only is a crew required for every shoot but episodes can take anywhere from 40 to 60 hours  (if not longer) to complete post-production. We were having to work through the nights and over the weekends around our actual production jobs in order to make SCARY SLEEPOVER happen, often times giving up paid work and falling behind on deadlines in our personal careers.  As much as we loved doing the show, no one involved could carry on producing a show where the people behind it were literally paying to work on it. So after 29 wonderful episodes, the reality of the situation won out and we had to call it a night.</p><h3>
<u><strong>WHAT PROMPTED THE RESURRECTION?</strong></u> </h3><p>Over the past summer two crucial things happened that caused us to start rethinking SCARY SLEEPOVER.  In July an article titled ""Adam Green Saved My Life"" was posted on NightmareNostalgia.com. In the piece, writer Landon Evanson bravely discussed his on going battle with depression and how SCARY SLEEPOVER had helped him through some of his darkest nights when he was having suicidal thoughts. It wasn't that the series possessed a magical cure for depression but by Landon connecting with the relationships and sincerity on display in SCARY SLEEPOVER, he saw just how fortunate his own friends make his life. We highly encourage you to read Landon's article <a href=""http://nightmarenostalgia.com/2019/07/13/adam-green-saved-my-life/%C2%A0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. [<a href=""http://nightmarenostalgia.com/2019/07/13/adam-green-saved-my-life/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://nightmarenostalgia.com/2019/07/13/adam-g...</a>]</p><p>It was Landon's story that first got us talking about resurrecting SCARY SLEEPOVER. Just like our show had helped him realize what he has in his own life, Landon's article helped us see what we have in our show. <i>Landon, if you see this - thank you for showing us that what we do matters. We're so very grateful that you're still here and that our work could help you when you needed it. </i></p><p>Just two months later, our dear friend Sid Haig passed away. Sid was a major part of our ArieScope family having appeared in HATCHET 3, our sit-com HOLLISTON, several of our annual Halloween short films, an episode of our original series HORRIFIED, two episodes of THE MOVIE CRYPT podcast, and two episodes of SCARY SLEEPOVER (his original episode in 2015 and the Christmas Special in 2017). While we had known that Sid was ill for a long time and though he had lived the fullest life a man could ever dream of living, his passing was still devastating. Sid had hundreds of films and television shows under his belt - not to mention countless interviews that he had given during his lifetime. Yet out of everything that fans could have turned to when he passed, it was Sid's 2015 episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER that many reached for to remember him with. His episode was suddenly viewed over 100,000 times within the first 48 hours of his passing and in turn, all of the episodes of SCARY SLEEPOVER quickly began climbing up and up in views as a whole new audience discovered the series. Once again we began to question our decision for walking away from the show before ever asking the community we were serving for help. We were ready to try and resurrect SCARY SLEEPOVER.  </p><p>After the financial hit that making the show had caused us the first time around, the most obvious change we knew we'd have to make was that our crew would need to be paid <i>something</i> for all of their hours of work this time around. While our loyal crew may be willing to work on the show for far below any kind of standard industry rates, with bills to pay and children at home to feed... the days of everyone always working for free are over. It was also crucial to all of us that if we were to bring the series back certain technical areas of the production would need to be improved on. For instance, one of our biggest concerns is making sure that we can afford to have a professional sound mixer and operator on set this time around. In making the first two seasons of the show we had to throw out <i>so</i> many incredible moments due to unusable sound. </p><p>As an example, our final episode (the Christmas Special in 2017) was so plagued with sound problems that <i>it was almost never released at all.</i> Kane Hodder, Danielle Harris, Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, and Felissa Rose were Adam Green's guests for that special episode. In the end, we knew that we couldn't <u>not</u> show the world such an incredible gathering with all of those horror icons having Christmas dinner and a slumber party together, so we fixed up the audio as best as we could and we released the episode with sound that legitimately made us ashamed. To make it worse, we had to throw out many wonderful moments that we captured between the group because the microphones we had weren't working at all. That night was such an incredible moment in time that will never happen again- (Sid would learn that he was seriously ill shortly after we shot) and our audio was unusable simply because we didn't have a budget to work with. It was heartbreaking. And we <i>can't</i> let that happen again. This time around we have to have help.</p><h3><u><strong>WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR:</strong></u></h3><p>In order to keep bringing you new episodes of SCARY SLEEPOVER, in order to keep the series independent, and in order to keep the series free to watch and accessible to all... we're asking for a budget of $5,000 (USD) per episode. That's IT. Could we ask for more? Absolutely. Should we? Probably. But right now all we want is to be able to make the show for you again without it negatively effecting our lives and putting us in debt like it did before. For every $5,000 raised we will put a new episode into production. It's that simple. Ultimately <u>you</u> decide just how many episodes you'll get based on how much and how often you donate.</p><p>Given the size of SCARY SLEEPOVER's audience and how many times the episodes are viewed, the meager $5k per episode budget that we collectively arrived at is more than fair. It is the bare minimum we need to pay our crew <i>something</i> for their work, to improve the quality of the show, and to keep the series free to watch on ArieScope.com and on ArieScope's YouTube channel - platforms that are readily accessible to all. Full disclose- we're extremely nervous that $5k may turn out not to be enough after all of the fees and taxes that get taken out before what we raise even gets to us. Remember, not only does Indiegogo take 5% of what we raise as their own ""platform fee"" but they also automatically set aside 5% of whatever we raise as a contingency to cover ""chargebacks"" (backers who default on whatever they pledged). So that's 10% gone right off the bat. Then the banks charge fees on <i>every individual pledge</i>. Every donation that comes from someone within the US has 2.9% + .30 taken out for a ""transaction fee"" while donations that come from other countries have a much <i>higher</i> amount taken out plus a hefty ""transfer fee"" (at least $25 or more) on top of that!  Finally, at the end of the year we'll also need to pay taxes on every dollar that came in just like all US citizens have to do. We know this is all information that is likely just making your eyes glaze over and your head spin. No, you don't need to call an exorcist. It's unfortunately just how crowdfunding goes and there is no way around it. We won't know the reality of it until after we've made the first crowd funded episode and see how it went but we're being transparent the whole way. If we have to adjust accordingly moving forward? Well, then we'll have to adjust accordingly. But hopefully you're getting a clear picture of just how much we're <i>trying</i> to make this work on as tight of a budget as possible.</p><h3><u><strong>""ONCE A NEW EPISODE IS GREEN-LIT, HOW LONG BEFORE WE CAN WATCH IT?""</strong></u></h3><p>Every time we hit another $5,000 goal we'll get started making an episode. Producing an episode can take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months. It all depends on guest/crew availability but we usually move rather fast. We'll post updates and include the most accurate ETA we can for when we expect the next episode to be ready. Should we become unavailable for any amount of time due to starting production on our next feature film or television project, it doesn't mean SCARY SLEEPOVER will end. In a perfect world donations are continuously coming in during the time we're away shooting the next big project. That way we come back to this with enough funding ready to make <i>multiple</i> episodes back to back rather than randomly making one here and making one there. It all depends on how the fundraising goes. But to be clear- this endeavor is not going to pay anyone enough to quit their career and stand by waiting for the next episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER to get green-lit. Please be reasonable. We'll get new episodes made as fast as we can and in a timely fashion. Episodes will be released simultaneously on ArieScope.com and ArieScope's YouTube channel. The same exact version will be released on both platforms. Want to help see episodes get made faster? Share this campaign on social media and encourage others to donate! </p><p>We'll end this campaign when funds seem to have stoped coming in. If things go well and we make a complete season (12 crowd funded episodes + 2 outtake episodes) rather quickly? Well, when the season is over we'll put a pin in the campaign while we take a break and recover, then start it up again once we're ready to tackle a new season. Let's see how it goes before worrying about that as having dozens of episodes financed would be an extremely high class problem to have!</p><h3><u><strong>""SO WHAT DO I GET FOR DONATING?""</strong></u></h3><p>You get THE SHOW!  Look, we know people love their buttons, posters, ""shout outs,"" shopping bags, T-shirts, and other crowdfunding rewards but we want to bring you as many episodes as possible for as low a production budget as possible. If we start creating and shipping a bunch of useless ""stuff"" all over the world we would need to raise WAY more per episode just to pay for all of it and we'd be spending our time shipping rewards instead of making the actual show. Donate because you want to get new episodes of SCARY SLEEPOVER, not because you want an official pencil sharpener or other random item with the show's logo on it. We're putting every dollar into the show, not squandering it on T-shirts.</p><p><i>OK, FINE!</i>  You want rewards? We created some wicked cool rewards that won't take away from the show itself or require us to jack up the minimum amount we need to raise just so that we can pay for ""Scary Sleepover"" hair ties, spatulas, staplers or other useless stuff that we all know you don't really need. Unfortunately, IndieGoGo's interface massively limits the amount of space where you can describe each reward so we've listed more thorough descriptions below. Remember- you can donate <u>any</u> amount you'd like. It's not like you have to purchase one of the rewards if you'd rather give less and just contribute what you can afford to give to help make the show happen. </p><p><strong>The Unlisted Reward</strong> =  This one is our reward to everyone who helps. For every 6 episodes that get green-lit we will create a 7th episode on our own that consists of outtakes and moments that you <u>didn't</u> see in the previous 6 episodes. With Seasons 1 and 2 we always did a mid-season and an end of season outtake episode. So just like the two previous seasons, we're only doing this for every 6 episodes that get green-lit. If the donations come to a complete stop after just 4 or 5 episodes? Well, that's unfortunately where the season ends. We'd love nothing more than to be able to do a full 14 episode season just like we used to (12 crowd funded episodes + 2 outtake episodes) but that's entirely up to you the audience.</p><p><strong>$50 = Scary Stream-over Party!</strong> Whenever this next season (technically Season 3) of Adam Green's SCARY SLEEPOVER is considered to be over you will receive a private invitation to an all-night, on-line ""Scary Stream-over Party"" with Adam and Arwen that is exclusively for backers who donated $50 or more. Please remember that at this point we have no idea how many episodes you guys will ultimately green-light so we have no way of knowing exactly how many episodes will constitute Season 3. We have to play it by ear and see what you do. Point is- everyone in this tier and above will be invited to an all-night Scary Sleepover live stream where we all watch movies, play games, talk about our fears together, and pig out on junk food. If you've ever enjoyed one of THE MOVIE CRYPT's annual live ""Yorkiethons"" or participated in MOVIE CRYPT LIVE (a monthly live stream for Patrons of the podcast) - this is gonna be similar to that only <u>better!</u> When the season ends a weekend night will be announced for the ""Stream-over."" When that weekend arrives a private link to the stream will go out to everyone who purchased a reward this season. Adam and Arwen will be on the stream with everyone all night. Knowing them they will have some surprises up their sleeves so you never know who else might show up and crash the party! This exclusive live ""Stream-over"" will essentially recreate what you see Adam and his guests do on the show and most likely go for an 8-hour stretch <i>like</i> 7pm PST until 3am PST (or hours <i>like</i> that).  We will give everyone at least 3 week's notice for when the slumber party is going to happen. Our apologies if the night that this winds up taking place doesn't work for you  but we're going to give everyone plenty of notice. Ideally this ""Stream-over"" will take place within a month of whenever the final episode of the season is released but for all we know Adam could be on set in the middle of directing a movie in Tunisia by then. Just know that one way or another we will make this event happen even. Seriously, this is a pretty awesome reward and we're all already looking forward to it!</p><p><strong>$100 = Thank You Credit!</strong> Not only will you get an invite to the all night, on-line ""Scary Stream-over Party"" listed above but you will be immortalized by having your name on screen at the end of an episode. This is sincerely a big deal to us as we're crediting you on screen right alongside our beloved crew. Having donated to and worked on crowd funded projects ourselves, one thing that we really hate to see is when the credits acknowledging <i>the very people who made the project happen</i> fly by so fast or are shoved up into the corner of the screen so small that no one could ever possibly read them. Hey, we get it. The average audience member immediately shuts off whatever they are watching once the credits start and with on-line content a ""play"" doesn't count as <i>completed</i> unless it plays until the end. That's why we do our ending credits for SCARY SLEEPOVER while there is something still happening - even if it is merely dialogue continuing on underneath the credits. We give people a reason to finish watching the entire episode. Therefore, everyone who ever watches an episode that you backed is going to see that you were part of making it happen. Please take this one seriously. We sure do as our crew is our <i>family</i>. To be acknowledged in our work alongside our brothers and sisters is an <u>honor</u>.</p><p><strong>$250 = Personalized ""Thank You"" video &amp; Early Access!</strong> Not only will you get all of the above (a thank you credit and an invite to the all night, on-line ""Scary Stream-over Party""), you'll also receive a private link to see the episode that you backed several days ahead if its premiere on-line! best of all, there will be a personalized introduction from Adam Green and Arwen thanking you for helping SCARY SLEEPOVER continue at the front of it! We debated offering this one for awhile as truthfully it takes a lot more time to make happen than you might think. (Any editors out there know how many hours it can actually take to create individual episodes for a variety of people, export them, and upload them to a private server.) But if you're going to back us this generously we want to make sure you see in our eyes just how appreciated you actually are. Sincerely, this one is a reward for us just as much as it may be a reward for you. A personalized video is the closest we can come to actually shaking your hand or full-on <i>hugging</i> you. You're a goddamn hero and we love you for caring this much about what we do. Let us tell you how we feel about you to your face.</p><p><strong>$5000 = Executive Producer!</strong> This is as big as it gets because at this level <u>you're one of us</u>. By singlehandedly financing an episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER you will be credited on screen as the sole Executive Producer at the <i>top</i> of the episode. Your ""Executive Producer"" credit will join ""Created By"" and ""Guest Star"" as the only credits at the beginning of the episode! You'll also be invited to join us on set when the episode shoots. <u>NOTE</u>: You are responsible for getting yourself to our studio in Los Angeles. We will give you as much advance notice of the shoot night as possible. In fact, you'll find out what date it is being scheduled for when <i>we</i> do. Scheduling SCARY SLEEPOVER's shoot nights is a lot like a game of human Tetris in that we're juggling our guest's and our entire crew's availability. That can give us extremely limited options. There have been times in the past where a guest tells us ""I'd love to do it! I'm in town tomorrow but then I'm not back again for 8 months. Can you make that work?"" and then we have to scramble to put the shoot together right up until the moment the guest arrives at the front door. Hopefully our audience backs enough episodes that we have some options for you as far as shoot nights go but if there aren't any other episodes in the pipeline we may not. For instance, if you can't get here for the very next episode we're going to be shooting, perhaps there are other shoot nights coming up that are a little bit further off in the calendar and that have more notice before they take place. Again, we have no way of knowing just how many episodes we're going to wind up making as it all depends on how this campaign goes. Just know that we'll do everything we possibly can to make the shoot happen on a night when you can be here for it. Please keep in mind that we can't control it if a guest or crew member suddenly falls ill or has an emergency arise and forces us to reschedule a shoot at the last minute any more than we can reschedule an entire shoot if <i>you</i> suddenly can't make it at the last minute. Our advice: Do this because you want to produce your own episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER and treat the set visit as an added bonus. Chances are good it will all work out but we have to be as thorough as possible in these descriptions.</p><p>Keep in mind, donations go toward the next episode in line being financed. It does not mean you continue to keep getting that reward for all future episodes as well. </p><p>So, there you go! <i>Rewards!</i></p><h3><u><strong>NOW... LET'S DO THIS!</strong></u></h3><p>While over 1 million people may have already watched Adam Green's SCARY SLEEPOVER, the reality is that very few are actually going to step up and help. They're going to wait and hope that <i>other</i> people donate - then watch the show. It's just how this goes. But if we didn't have at least a <i>little</i> bit of faith in our audience we wouldn't have gone through the effort of making the video you watched above or putting together this campaign. We believe in you!</p><p>This is the moment when you show us what SCARY SLEEPOVER means to you. Do the slumber parties continue or are they truly over? We sincerely hope that you'll consider backing us generously and continuously as the series (hopefully) continues on and on. Thank you for taking the time to check out our campaign.</p><p>Most sincerely-</p><p>The ArieScope Family</p><p><i>SCARY SLEEPOVER: RESURRECTION VIDEO made by Sean Becker, Will Barratt, Adam Green, and Arwen.

Landon, if you see this - thank you for showing us that what we do matters. We're so very grateful that you're still here and that our work could help you when you needed it. Just two months later, our dear friend Sid Haig passed away. Sid was a major part of our ArieScope family having appeared in HATCHET 3, our sit-com HOLLISTON, several of our annual Halloween short films, an episode of our original series HORRIFIED, two episodes of THE MOVIE CRYPT podcast, and two episodes of SCARY SLEEPOVER (his original episode in 2015 and the Christmas Special in 2017).

It is the bare minimum we need to pay our crew something for their work, to improve the quality of the show, and to keep the series free to watch on ArieScope.com and on ArieScope's YouTube channel - platforms that are readily accessible to all. Full disclose- we're extremely nervous that $5k may turn out not to be enough after all of the fees and taxes that get taken out before what we raise even gets to us. Remember, not only does Indiegogo take 5% of what we raise as their own ""platform fee"" but they also automatically set aside 5% of whatever we raise as a contingency to cover ""chargebacks"" (backers who default on whatever they pledged). So that's 10% gone right off the bat. Then the banks charge fees on every individual pledge. Every donation that comes from someone within the US has 2.9% + .30 taken out for a ""transaction fee"" while donations that come from other countries have a much higher amount taken out plus a hefty ""transfer fee"" (at least $25 or more) on top of that!  Finally, at the end of the year we'll also need to pay taxes on every dollar that came in just like all US citizens have to do. We know this is all information that is likely just making your eyes glaze over and your head spin. No, you don't need to call an exorcist. It's unfortunately just how crowdfunding goes and there is no way around it. We won't know the reality of it until after we've made the first crowd funded episode and see how it went but we're being transparent the whole way. If we have to adjust accordingly moving forward? Well, then we'll have to adjust accordingly. But hopefully you're getting a clear picture of just how much we're trying to make this work on as tight of a budget as possible.""ONCE A NEW EPISODE IS GREEN-LIT, HOW LONG BEFORE WE CAN WATCH IT?""Every time we hit another $5,000 goal we'll get started making an episode. Producing an episode can take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months. It all depends on guest/crew availability but we usually move rather fast. We'll post updates and include the most accurate ETA we can for when we expect the next episode to be ready. Should we become unavailable for any amount of time due to starting production on our next feature film or television project, it doesn't mean SCARY SLEEPOVER will end. In a perfect world donations are continuously coming in during the time we're away shooting the next big project. That way we come back to this with enough funding ready to make multiple episodes back to back rather than randomly making one here and making one there. It all depends on how the fundraising goes. But to be clear- this endeavor is not going to pay anyone enough to quit their career and stand by waiting for the next episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER to get green-lit. Please be reasonable. We'll get new episodes made as fast as we can and in a timely fashion. Episodes will be released simultaneously on ArieScope.com and ArieScope's YouTube channel. The same exact version will be released on both platforms. Want to help see episodes get made faster? Share this campaign on social media and encourage others to donate! We'll end this campaign when funds seem to have stoped coming in. If things go well and we make a complete season (12 crowd funded episodes + 2 outtake episodes) rather quickly? Well, when the season is over we'll put a pin in the campaign while we take a break and recover, then start it up again once we're ready to tackle a new season. Let's see how it goes before worrying about that as having dozens of episodes financed would be an extremely high class problem to have!""SO WHAT DO I GET FOR DONATING?""You get THE SHOW!  Look, we know people love their buttons, posters, ""shout outs,"" shopping bags, T-shirts, and other crowdfunding rewards but we want to bring you as many episodes as possible for as low a production budget as possible. If we start creating and shipping a bunch of useless ""stuff"" all over the world we would need to raise WAY more per episode just to pay for all of it and we'd be spending our time shipping rewards instead of making the actual show. Donate because you want to get new episodes of SCARY SLEEPOVER, not because you want an official pencil sharpener or other random item with the show's logo on it. We're putting every dollar into the show, not squandering it on T-shirts.OK, FINE!  You want rewards? We created some wicked cool rewards that won't take away from the show itself or require us to jack up the minimum amount we need to raise just so that we can pay for ""Scary Sleepover"" hair ties, spatulas, staplers or other useless stuff that we all know you don't really need. Unfortunately, IndieGoGo's interface massively limits the amount of space where you can describe each reward so we've listed more thorough descriptions below. Remember- you can donate any amount you'd like. It's not like you have to purchase one of the rewards if you'd rather give less and just contribute what you can afford to give to help make the show happen. The Unlisted Reward =  This one is our reward to everyone who helps. For every 6 episodes that get green-lit we will create a 7th episode on our own that consists of outtakes and moments that you didn't see in the previous 6 episodes. With Seasons 1 and 2 we always did a mid-season and an end of season outtake episode. So just like the two previous seasons, we're only doing this for every 6 episodes that get green-lit. If the donations come to a complete stop after just 4 or 5 episodes? Well, that's unfortunately where the season ends. We'd love nothing more than to be able to do a full 14 episode season just like we used to (12 crowd funded episodes + 2 outtake episodes) but that's entirely up to you the audience.$50 = Scary Stream-over Party! Whenever this next season (technically Season 3) of Adam Green's SCARY SLEEPOVER is considered to be over you will receive a private invitation to an all-night, on-line ""Scary Stream-over Party"" with Adam and Arwen that is exclusively for backers who donated $50 or more. Please remember that at this point we have no idea how many episodes you guys will ultimately green-light so we have no way of knowing exactly how many episodes will constitute Season 3. We have to play it by ear and see what you do. Point is- everyone in this tier and above will be invited to an all-night Scary Sleepover live stream where we all watch movies, play games, talk about our fears together, and pig out on junk food. If you've ever enjoyed one of THE MOVIE CRYPT's annual live ""Yorkiethons"" or participated in MOVIE CRYPT LIVE (a monthly live stream for Patrons of the podcast) - this is gonna be similar to that only better! When the season ends a weekend night will be announced for the ""Stream-over."" When that weekend arrives a private link to the stream will go out to everyone who purchased a reward this season. Adam and Arwen will be on the stream with everyone all night. Knowing them they will have some surprises up their sleeves so you never know who else might show up and crash the party! This exclusive live ""Stream-over"" will essentially recreate what you see Adam and his guests do on the show and most likely go for an 8-hour stretch like 7pm PST until 3am PST (or hours like that).  We will give everyone at least 3 week's notice for when the slumber party is going to happen. Our apologies if the night that this winds up taking place doesn't work for you  but we're going to give everyone plenty of notice. Ideally this ""Stream-over"" will take place within a month of whenever the final episode of the season is released but for all we know Adam could be on set in the middle of directing a movie in Tunisia by then. Just know that one way or another we will make this event happen even. Seriously, this is a pretty awesome reward and we're all already looking forward to it!$100 = Thank You Credit! Not only will you get an invite to the all night, on-line ""Scary Stream-over Party"" listed above but you will be immortalized by having your name on screen at the end of an episode. This is sincerely a big deal to us as we're crediting you on screen right alongside our beloved crew. Having donated to and worked on crowd funded projects ourselves, one thing that we really hate to see is when the credits acknowledging the very people who made the project happen fly by so fast or are shoved up into the corner of the screen so small that no one could ever possibly read them. Hey, we get it. The average audience member immediately shuts off whatever they are watching once the credits start and with on-line content a ""play"" doesn't count as completed unless it plays until the end. That's why we do our ending credits for SCARY SLEEPOVER while there is something still happening - even if it is merely dialogue continuing on underneath the credits. We give people a reason to finish watching the entire episode. Therefore, everyone who ever watches an episode that you backed is going to see that you were part of making it happen. Please take this one seriously. We sure do as our crew is our family. To be acknowledged in our work alongside our brothers and sisters is an honor.$250 = Personalized ""Thank You"" video & Early Access! Not only will you get all of the above (a thank you credit and an invite to the all night, on-line ""Scary Stream-over Party""), you'll also receive a private link to see the episode that you backed several days ahead if its premiere on-line! best of all, there will be a personalized introduction from Adam Green and Arwen thanking you for helping SCARY SLEEPOVER continue at the front of it! We debated offering this one for awhile as truthfully it takes a lot more time to make happen than you might think. (Any editors out there know how many hours it can actually take to create individual episodes for a variety of people, export them, and upload them to a private server.) But if you're going to back us this generously we want to make sure you see in our eyes just how appreciated you actually are. Sincerely, this one is a reward for us just as much as it may be a reward for you. A personalized video is the closest we can come to actually shaking your hand or full-on hugging you. You're a goddamn hero and we love you for caring this much about what we do. Let us tell you how we feel about you to your face.$5000 = Executive Producer! This is as big as it gets because at this level you're one of us. By singlehandedly financing an episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER you will be credited on screen as the sole Executive Producer at the top of the episode. Your ""Executive Producer"" credit will join ""Created By"" and ""Guest Star"" as the only credits at the beginning of the episode! You'll also be invited to join us on set when the episode shoots. NOTE: You are responsible for getting yourself to our studio in Los Angeles. We will give you as much advance notice of the shoot night as possible. In fact, you'll find out what date it is being scheduled for when we do. Scheduling SCARY SLEEPOVER's shoot nights is a lot like a game of human Tetris in that we're juggling our guest's and our entire crew's availability. That can give us extremely limited options. There have been times in the past where a guest tells us ""I'd love to do it! I'm in town tomorrow but then I'm not back again for 8 months. Can you make that work?"" and then we have to scramble to put the shoot together right up until the moment the guest arrives at the front door. Hopefully our audience backs enough episodes that we have some options for you as far as shoot nights go but if there aren't any other episodes in the pipeline we may not. For instance, if you can't get here for the very next episode we're going to be shooting, perhaps there are other shoot nights coming up that are a little bit further off in the calendar and that have more notice before they take place. Again, we have no way of knowing just how many episodes we're going to wind up making as it all depends on how this campaign goes. Just know that we'll do everything we possibly can to make the shoot happen on a night when you can be here for it. Please keep in mind that we can't control it if a guest or crew member suddenly falls ill or has an emergency arise and forces us to reschedule a shoot at the last minute any more than we can reschedule an entire shoot if you suddenly can't make it at the last minute. Our advice: Do this because you want to produce your own episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER and treat the set visit as an added bonus. Chances are good it will all work out but we have to be as thorough as possible in these descriptions.Keep in mind, donations go toward the next episode in line being financed. It does not mean you continue to keep getting that reward for all future episodes as well. So, there you go! Rewards!NOW... LET'S DO THIS!While over 1 million people may have already watched Adam Green's SCARY SLEEPOVER, the reality is that very few are actually going to step up and help. They're going to wait and hope that other people donate - then watch the show. It's just how this goes. But if we didn't have at least a little bit of faith in our audience we wouldn't have gone through the effort of making the video you watched above or putting together this campaign. We believe in you!This is the moment when you show us what SCARY SLEEPOVER means to you. Do the slumber parties continue or are they truly over? We sincerely hope that you'll consider backing us generously and continuously as the series (hopefully) continues on and on. Thank you for taking the time to check out our campaign.Most sincerely-The ArieScope FamilySCARY SLEEPOVER: RESURRECTION VIDEO made by Sean Becker, Will Barratt, Adam Green, and Arwen. Massive thanks to Lola Barbare (""Arwen""), Jeremy Wanek (Arwen VFX), Kevin Barbare, and to Josh Ethier for letting us pretend to yell at you.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>“Diagnosis: Boring” follows Jess Lowry, the prototypical millennial, whose life changes quickly when her doctor diagnoses her with a potentially fatal case of being “boring.” Jess finds herself in a position that many people today find themselves in; socially connected, employed, healthy, and utterly miserable. We watch as, episode by episode, Jess goes through everyday “cure’s” to depression—therapy apps, self-help gurus, reliance on alcohol— only in the world of “Diagnosis: Boring” these are commonly thought of as remedies for “being boring”.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/vc1hvD7rbqk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div> <p>The story of Jess Lowry is very much one of a sane character in an insane world. The trickiness of depression is that it tends to be a sickness that affects the patients logic, and people suffering from it often don't feel like there is anything wrong with them, but rather the world around them. ""Diagnosis: Boring"" aims to get in Jess's head, to a place where the viewing audience can see things the same way she does. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is no doubting the steady advance of the social media generation-- the new millennial wave of activism and radical tolerance is an unavoidable subject on any news show or at family dinner-- but with it, a disease has quietly been on the rise, like its shadow: Depression.</p>
<p>From the outside looking in, depression is often defined as being sad. Depression, however, is just the opposite; it is the lack of sadness, it is the lack of happiness, it is the lack of any emotion at all. Depression feels a lot like being bored... by everything and anything.</p>
<p>By externalizing so much of the inner struggle that depression is, ""Diagnosis: Boring"" looks to bring levity to what can often be considered an extremely heavy subject manner. Hopefully, by bringing laughs to such a serious subject, it will become more approachable, and easier to talk about, at a more public level. </p>

<h3>The Investment</h3>
<p>While we already have a good start on funding, there are three main areas of the budget where your contribution will help us: production design, crew support, and post-production.</p>
<p><u>Production Design</u></p>
<p>The goal of this web series is to take a sane character and place her in an insane world. This means we have to create the insane world. This is where a significant amount of the budget will go. We are going to work with local Chicago artists, businesses, and locations to build this world into something wholly unique and different.</p>
<p><u>Crew Support</u></p>
<p>We want to recruit a diverse and talented crew that will help make this world come to life. And we want to support them for all the hard work. To make five different six minute episodes is going to require a lot of resources, time, and effort from quite a few people. </p>
<p><u>Post-Production</u></p>
<p>While shooting the film itself takes out a large portion of the budget, so does the detailed work that goes into post-production of the film. Once the picture is locked, we'll spend weeks focused on editing, colorization, and sound mixing before it is ready to be released. </p>

<h3>The Thank You</h3>
<p>Thank you! Thank you for taking the time to learn about ""Diagnosis: Boring."" Even if you can't contribute to the fundraiser at this time, we appreciate your interest and would love if you can share this page with others. And if you are able to contribute, we are grateful for it. We believe we're creating something special and we look forward to sharing it with you when it's complete. </p>
</div></div>","The series is now available to watch! Check out Episode 1: 

 
The Story
“Diagnosis: Boring” follows Jess Lowry, the prototypical millennial, whose life changes quickly when her doctor diagnoses her with a potentially fatal case of being “boring.” Jess finds herself in a position that many people today find themselves in; socially connected, employed, healthy, and utterly miserable. We watch as, episode by episode, Jess goes through everyday “cure’s” to depression—therapy apps, self-help gurus, reliance on alcohol— only in the world of “Diagnosis: Boring” these are commonly thought of as remedies for “being boring”.
 The story of Jess Lowry is very much one of a sane character in an insane world. The trickiness of depression is that it tends to be a sickness that affects the patients logic, and people suffering from it often don't feel like there is anything wrong with them, but rather the world around them. ""Diagnosis: Boring"" aims to get in Jess's head, to a place where the viewing audience can see things the same way she does. 


The Impact
There is no doubting the steady advance of the social media generation-- the new millennial wave of activism and radical tolerance is an unavoidable subject on any news show or at family dinner-- but with it, a disease has quietly been on the rise, like its shadow: Depression.
From the outside looking in, depression is often defined as being sad. Depression, however, is just the opposite; it is the lack of sadness, it is the lack of happiness, it is the lack of any emotion at all. Depression feels a lot like being bored... by everything and anything.
By externalizing so much of the inner struggle that depression is, ""Diagnosis: Boring"" looks to bring levity to what can often be considered an extremely heavy subject manner. Hopefully, by bringing laughs to such a serious subject, it will become more approachable, and easier to talk about, at a more public level.

<h2><strong>We are The Dope Life...and you might be too.</strong></h2>
<p>Derek is what many would call a “wanna be”. He’s always been intrigued by hip-hop culture and he tends to standout - especially in a culture of roofers, stay-at-home moms and guys that call you a 'sissy' if you think global warming is real. Hate it or love it, these are the simpler places and Deedleburg likes to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Most aspiring creatives, move to cities to evade the places they were born and raised. But Derek can't. He's stuck in Deebleburg due to the long and drawn-out laws regarding parole. He wants to get out and entertain the world through his raps, dancing or really any opportunity that might bring him fame and glory, but the system and his bad habits stand against him.</p>
<p>The Dope Life is more than just an exploitation or mockery of the suburbs of America. This is a story of the struggles any artistic or radical person faces in the search for self worth, a place in society or at the very least, individual freedom while trapped in an unhealthy environment.</p>
<p>What started out as a quick sketch comedy about a foolish, over-the-top, white-rapper in a red state turned into a script that we have rewritten and evolved into a 5-part series. It grew from 4 years of jokes, witty banter and heart to hearts between myself and Derrick Sloan (Derrick Dillard) on the daily.</p>
<p>The merge of three personalities, an ex-felon, an ex-marine and a probation officer, form The Dope Life. Three contrasting 30-year-old’s with extreme identity flaws are bound together by an existential crisis and passion for their town's least favorite art form - rap music.  They all suffer from mental instabilities spawned by their personal experiences with our American institutions – correctional, military and an often unjust judicial system. </p>
<p>At face value, Dereck and his peers may seem like a bunch of goofy deadbeats facing dilemmas related to depression, anxiety and other mental illnesses. Yet despite all odds, they carry on with high hopes and plans to escape small town culture – making Deebleburg the battleground of a life worth living. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Putting together a viable film crew is...</strong></h2>
<p>EXPENSIVE. We wish we could do it all ourselves, but have found we need financial support in efforts to bring in a Director of Photography, Sound Recordist, Post-Production Editor and a Makeup Artist. While we've compiled a great cast and found locations that will be telling of the atmosphere, Crew talent in Austin, TX is costly and rightly so. Therefore, financial demands are outside of what we servers, teachers and bartenders can afford.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>For our 25-page script, we will need to shoot for 5 days total.</strong></h3>
<p>We've got our eyes set on some really talented and experienced members of the Austin Film Community that are quickly turning into industry pro's. Here's a breakdown of what we need to land them.</p>
<p>Director of Photography - $300/day - $1500/shoot</p>
<p>Sound Engineer/Recordist - $150/day - $750/shoot</p>
<p>Hair/Makeup Artist - $75/day - $375/shoot</p>
<p>Props/Location Expenses - $425</p>
<p>Post Production Editor - $750</p>
<p>Food/Beverage - Anything extra helps but we know how to eat cheap!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>Monetary support is amazing, but any encouragement is great.</strong> </h3>
<p>We wouldn't be here asking for help if we thought we could scrounge up any more than we already have. We know most of our friends and colleagues fall in to the same financial boundaries that we do. So while we greatly appreciate any funding you can afford to help with, a share, a like or even just a text saying ""Haha"" is super encouraging and we'll use it as fuel to get this pilot done and out to the public. </p>

The incredible journey with these characters has just begun and we want you to see where each and every storyline goes.  We would love the opportunity to continue sharing this journey with you all, creating a story that shows how everything unfolds, and who is left standing when the dust finally settles.

<p>Hi! I'm Chris Russell. I'm a screenwriter, filmmaker and actor. Two years ago, I quit my job as a hotel doorman. Being a doorman was a big part of my identity, and was the inspiration for my first web series. It was also how I kept a roof over my head and maintained health insurance. I gave up the stability of a full-time job to pursue my lifelong dream of being an actor. It was the greatest risk of my life. I had no other work lined up -- only a small amount of savings, and a whole helluva-lot of hustle.</p>
<p>The risk has paid off. In the time that has passed, I got an agent, booked some commercials, joined SAG, and landed a recurring role on an HBO series. And yet, despite all of those wonderful advances in my career, I still find myself scrapping to get by in-between gigs, drowning in bills and scrounging to take any job I can to keep me afloat. </p>
<p>Which brings me to ""Flyering"". </p>
<p>One of the many ""survival jobs"" I work is handing out flyers in the streets. Have you seen these people before? Of course you have! Have you acknowledged them? Be honest... Yeah, neither did I... till I actually had to do it for an entire day. </p>
<p>I knew almost immediately that this was a breeding ground for bizarre, fascinating human interaction. On top of that, I've met some amazingly talented artists, who are also fighting to keep the dream alive while doing whatever they can to make a few bucks while chasing the dream. </p>
<p>They are the guts of what my show is about. Your contributions will help this hilarious and heartfelt story come to life. </p>

<p>What makes SCALES different?</p>
<p>The show represents a community that has not been able to have their story told and represented. The series looks at characters moving through challenges in life through a lens without placing society-based labels on who and how these characters love. In SCALES, the social norms of what is acceptable are non-existent. Remy is a successful editor of successful Atlanta based magazine and by all standards, could be a heterosexual male.</p>
<p>Remy is successful in his work life and has awesome friendships, but his inability to balance love is his achilles heel. Audiences care about Remy and the plight of his friendships, and who he loves is less important. There are many norms to being gay and SCALES casually points out those norms. Gavin, who rounds out the trio who is a trans-male. Gavin’s journey in SCALES is not to educate you on what trans mean or what it looks like but what being a relationship in turmoil looks like, regardless of the two parties involved.</p>
<p>SCALES focuses on the dynamics and beauty of the friendships with problems that other person faces, regardless of race, gender, etc... Being unapologetic in SCALES means being comfortable in your own skin and that is what sets this Drama-Comedy genre apart from other shows. The intentional vibe around SCALES includes music featured by all independent artists that personifies the beauty of independent filmmaking. These unknowns will resonate with audiences as the story of SCALES is being told by an indie creator, who’s been given a platform to share such original programming.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<h3>COVID Ditty is keeping New York Actors Creative and Working Through Tough Times</h3>
<p>A Bronx-bred, film-TV-theater actor, Steve is a character actor who typically plays working-class people. Sometimes, he plays complementary roles such as an attorney opposite a headliner, like multiple Grammy- and Tony-Award winner Patti LaPone in FX’s hit show POSE. </p>
<p>But the COVID-19 pandemic has changed things, including Steve. After months of isolation and continuous death-toll updates, he subconsciously decided to squint so he could see the humor amid the wreckage.</p>
<p>“There is a place for the human expression of some sort of  joy—or we would have all gone crazy,” says Steve, who shook the room with his booming voice as the miserable Ghost of Jacob Marley in A Christmas Carol in Harlem at the Classic Theater of Harlem—before the pandemic shut down everything.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Steve saw juxtapositions and inequities everywhere. Schools and houses of worship closed down, but liquor stores, fast-food joints and the state lottery were open for business. Teachers expressed concern about going back to work, while minimum-wage workers at McDonald’s dished “essential” burgers seemingly around the clock.</p>
<p>With Broadway locked down, Steve has started a new NYC production during the pandemic—about the pandemic—with his own cobbled-together life savings. He recently began writing an eight-part “dramedy”—COVID Ditty—a series of short vignettes that captures glimpses of oddities and ironies that we have all been too numb to fully digest. Steve is the writer, the director and the lead as “Phil”, who is a simple, lumbering, lunch-pail guy trying to make sense of the new world order.</p>
<p>Steve’s other new role is one of job creator. So far, he has hired SAG-AFTRA actors, like himself, for Episode 1, as well as an editor, a Go Pro cameraman, someone in charge of music, a production team and a digital marketing firm with a publicist to get the word out. </p>
<p>According to Steve, New York City is the tale of two cities: the posh “Goldman Sachs New York” who have the resources to cut and run to the Hamptons, Miami or points beyond when the going gets tough and the blue-collar families who grind and endure, making the city’s gears turn every day—even when the New York Post’s headline screams, “New York City is Dead Forever.”</p>
<p>“COVID Ditty is a New Yorker’s love letter to his neighborhood,” Steve says. “It’s a love letter for the people who went through 9/11 and the people who are going through this pandemic—and they are still HERE. They love the city. They see the good in people. They are rising above the news, all the partisan anger and rancor. They are regular joes, trying to get by. There are plenty of those people out there.” Now COVID Ditty hopes to keep production of the additional episodes  moving forward with help from the greater community. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Help Keep COVID Ditty Progressing....</h3>
<p>Steve, in his own words:</p>
<p>I always bet on a sure thing. The COVID Ditty web series is a testament to the hard-working NYC families who have chosen to stay and fight. I have reached into my SAG-AFTRA retirement savings to produce the first scripts for Season One, but I need your help to finish the eight-part series.

</div><p> </p></div>","COVID Ditty is keeping New York Actors Creative and Working Through Tough Times
A Bronx-bred, film-TV-theater actor, Steve is a character actor who typically plays working-class people. Sometimes, he plays complementary roles such as an attorney opposite a headliner, like multiple Grammy- and Tony-Award winner Patti LaPone in FX’s hit show POSE. 
But the COVID-19 pandemic has changed things, including Steve. After months of isolation and continuous death-toll updates, he subconsciously decided to squint so he could see the humor amid the wreckage.
“There is a place for the human expression of some sort of  joy—or we would have all gone crazy,” says Steve, who shook the room with his booming voice as the miserable Ghost of Jacob Marley in A Christmas Carol in Harlem at the Classic Theater of Harlem—before the pandemic shut down everything.
Suddenly, Steve saw juxtapositions and inequities everywhere. Schools and houses of worship closed down, but liquor stores, fast-food joints and the state lottery were open for business. Teachers expressed concern about going back to work, while minimum-wage workers at McDonald’s dished “essential” burgers seemingly around the clock.
With Broadway locked down, Steve has started a new NYC production during the pandemic—about the pandemic—with his own cobbled-together life savings. He recently began writing an eight-part “dramedy”—COVID Ditty—a series of short vignettes that captures glimpses of oddities and ironies that we have all been too numb to fully digest. Steve is the writer, the director and the lead as “Phil”, who is a simple, lumbering, lunch-pail guy trying to make sense of the new world order.
Steve’s other new role is one of job creator. So far, he has hired SAG-AFTRA actors, like himself, for Episode 1, as well as an editor, a Go Pro cameraman, someone in charge of music, a production team and a digital marketing firm with a publicist to get the word out. 
According to Steve, New York City is the tale of two cities: the posh “Goldman Sachs New York” who have the resources to cut and run to the Hamptons, Miami or points beyond when the going gets tough and the blue-collar families who grind and endure, making the city’s gears turn every day—even when the New York Post’s headline screams, “New York City is Dead Forever.”
“COVID Ditty is a New Yorker’s love letter to his neighborhood,” Steve says. “It’s a love letter for the people who went through 9/11 and the people who are going through this pandemic—and they are still HERE. They love the city. They see the good in people. They are rising above the news, all the partisan anger and rancor. They are regular joes, trying to get by. There are plenty of those people out there.” Now COVID Ditty hopes to keep production of the additional episodes  moving forward with help from the greater community. 
 

Help Keep COVID Ditty Progressing....
Steve, in his own words:
I always bet on a sure thing. The COVID Ditty web series is a testament to the hard-working NYC families who have chosen to stay and fight. I have reached into my SAG-AFTRA retirement savings to produce the first scripts for Season One, but I need your help to finish the eight-part series. We have actors, an editor and a production team counting on us. We are an economic engine that is putting money into the local Bronx economy. Every time a coffee is bought over a script meeting, a lunch is served on set or an interior location is used, a local Kingsbridge business benefits. The arts are job creators! If you believe New Yorkers don’t quit, please make a contribution today to keep this work alive. For donations more than $60, I’ll throw in a t-shirt that captures this memorable work during an unforgettable time.

The Impact
ALL donations will keep the show in production and contribute to keeping NY artists and crew working through this difficult time that has especially impacted artists and creatives across this city, the country and the world.

Support NYC actors and neighborhoods
Contribute to a heartfelt, relevant series that can share light to many during a difficult time.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Have you ever found yourself among a group of women and you wondered what they were really thinking? Maybe you considered the possibility of that smile on their face being fake, because how could someone really be that happy in this chaotic world?</p>
<p>Maybe you have been trying to live up to the standard of the proverbs 31 woman not realizing she was a fictional character in a poem written by a queen to her son. Maybe you have been trying to do all the things she did, instead of discovering the virtues that exist in a proverbs 31 woman.</p>
<p>No matter which you are, we believe that Ruby Unleashed will unlock the woman within that has been longing to come out and be accounted for.</p>
<p>Hi, My name is Deborah Watson, and I'm the founder for Studio 2.22 Films in Branson, Mo. For years, I have watched people be passed over for a promotion for one reason or another. Normal, every day people with extraordinary talent, hidden inside but never having the opportunity to come out and shine.</p>
<p>I have also been ""one of those"" that was stuck in the ""doing the proverbs 31 woman thing"" instead of focusing on the character of a woman. I was exhausting myself ""rising early"" and providing more than enough for everyone in the house. Staying up late at night to make sure things were achieved. Yes, I even longed for giving birth to a child to be a great mom! But that day didn't come biologically, and I always felt like a failure. Until I came to grips with who a Proverbs 31 woman really was.</p>
<p>She's every day people. Single women. She's refined. She's casual. She likes to cook, and possibly hunt, and even write parables to encourage others in their faith.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Right now we need to finish paying off the cost for a pilot we built to send to the networks. We are also raising support to pay for the setup fees for the rubyunleashed.com website.</p>
<p>The team has worked hard already and will continue together as we head into preproduction for the first Season.</p>
<p>Once we pay for the remaining balances, we will be free to move forward with the Season I production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of Ruby Unleashed will be to help bring fun, Christian, faith-based programs to mainstream television and give other options for entertainment on the networks. It's written in such a way that Christian, or non-Christian people can watch it and laugh together, cry together, wonder what's going to happen to Ruby together.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Life can be messy. We have chosen to include real life struggles handled through biblical principles. We're not going to shy away from some topics because women deal with them. It doesn't matter if they attend church or not. There are clear answers to todays issues and it's time that they are talked about in mainstream media.</p>
<p>We've been criticized for calling it ""Ruby Unleashed- The adventures of a proverbs 31 woman"" The train of thought is that people won't give it a chance because it's too ""churchie"". We're hoping they do give it a chance, once they meet the characters in the story and realize the validity of the message.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone can help out financially. We're a firm believing group of people that understand this fact, we're five people away from talking to whomever we need to talk to, so that we can achieve whatever it is we need to achieve. If you can't help out the campaign financially, feel free to share it with your friends. Maybe one of them is praying for an opportunity like this. Or you can visit our website at rubyunleashed.com and visit the about us page.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>In Development is being produced by both students and recently graduated ""adults"" who are just beginning to make our impact on the industry. We faced significant pre-production challenges that were largely helped by Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, and are thrilled to be moving forward. Our goal is to produce work that makes people laugh- plain and simple. So many people look forward to going home and catching up on their favorite series, and we're hoping that we can become that series in the near future. Is there anything quite like that feeling? (Ok, maybe when you don't get charged for guac, but not much else). </p>
<p>With your contribution, you are directly impacting the quality of In Development. From equipment, to actors, to crew meals, every penny counts to making sure we have the best and brightest working on our show- the future of laughter depends on it.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $3,000 to cover essential production costs, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Equipment: </b>Lights, Camera, Action would be pretty hard to carry out without lights...or a camera. We have rental packages from Adorama and Gotham Sound to make sure our production looks and sounds top notch, which is essential for putting our best foot forward when pitching our full season in the future.</li>
<li>
<b>Actors: </b>Our project will be registered with the Screen Actors Guild, which means that we are recruiting some of the best talent we know. These funds will also be allocated to paying our actors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Crew Meals: </strong>Every six hours on set, it is customary to feed your cast and crew. These crew meals will help tremendously on 12 hour shoot days and provide the sustenance needed to get the job done!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What Happens if We Don't Reach Our Whole Goal?</strong></p>
<p>We are positive we will. </p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>When the mystery of a child snatched from its mother - WINIFRED NEKESA, at birth grips the nation, Anthony and his team - MIKE, HENRIETTA, and JACINTA, swing into action.  </p>

<p>But Margaret is not alone in her concern for her star employee. At home, AYAN - Anthony’s beautiful wife, is 6 months pregnant and frightened at the thought of possibly raising a young family on her own.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, I’m Bella, the writer and creator of the BABY MAMA DRAMA: WEB SERIES! Having received my B.A. in Multimedia and Filmmaking in 2015 from NJCU, I’ve been putting sincere effort into fulfilling my passion, gaining experience and creating art with the skills I have been blessed to learn while doing what I love most – STORY TELLING. </p>
<p>With my passion, I was able to create a story that so many of my peers and countless others throughout the world can relate to. The BABY MAMA DRAMA story has resonated with so many people who deserve to know what has become of the characters they've connected to so easily; but that cannot be done without your kindness and generosity. </p>

<h3>Lock the Target</h3>
<p>Hey everybody, it's Rexx Arkana from STATIK Industrial TV. We've been blown away by the international support STATIK has received from our viewers. We are delighted to be able to serve a community of people  who love dark electronic music as much as we do.</p>
<p>From dancing with my mother as a child to hanging out in the record stores as a teen, music is a big part of my background. At STATIK TV, we love sharing the stories of artists in our scene and celebrating our mutual love of industrial music and culture with you.</p>
<p>But I am also hoping you'll love us back...and get on board with us as we prepare to bring you Mechanismus Festival this summer. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Bait the Line</h3>
<p>Creating a video series like STATIK is  a lot of fun, but it's also costly. For example, bringing  our viewers the highest quality footage requires at least two pro grade cameras, only one of which we own. We have to rent the others, along with additional peripherals and auxiliary equipment such as lights, cables, controllers and power drops. Since Seattle is on the other side of the country from our base in New York, covering Mechanismus will also necessitate air travel and a hotel, which alone will run in excess of $3000US for a three person crew.</p>
<p>We currently publish all of our content for free, and we don't sell advertising or influence. The only way for us to recoup any of our costs is through the patronage of you, our amazing audience.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Spread the Net</h3>
<p>We are prepared to thank you graciously for your support, and we've established lots of different levels for people to contribute to our campaign. From t-shirts to photo books, shout-outs to swag bags, we think you'll find something to get excited about in our list of perks. On top of limited edition commemorative merchandise, select boosters contributing $35 or more will receive video recognition of their support from their favorite artists, posted publicly to their Facebook wall (or digital file). Those who pledge $50 or more have the chance to ask select festival performers anything they'd like to know about their work, while STATIK captures it all for the world to see. </p>
<p>All boosters at any level will receive early access to future published Mechanismus-related video content.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Catch the Man</h3>
<p>With your help, we can do more things faster. This is true of all episodes, but especially when trying to cover a five-day festival half a world away.

Hey everybody, it's Rexx Arkana from STATIK Industrial TV. We've been blown away by the international support STATIK has received from our viewers. We are delighted to be able to serve a community of people  who love dark electronic music as much as we do.
From dancing with my mother as a child to hanging out in the record stores as a teen, music is a big part of my background. At STATIK TV, we love sharing the stories of artists in our scene and celebrating our mutual love of industrial music and culture with you.
But I am also hoping you'll love us back...and get on board with us as we prepare to bring you Mechanismus Festival this summer. 
 

Bait the Line
Creating a video series like STATIK is  a lot of fun, but it's also costly. For example, bringing  our viewers the highest quality footage requires at least two pro grade cameras, only one of which we own. We have to rent the others, along with additional peripherals and auxiliary equipment such as lights, cables, controllers and power drops. Since Seattle is on the other side of the country from our base in New York, covering Mechanismus will also necessitate air travel and a hotel, which alone will run in excess of $3000US for a three person crew.
We currently publish all of our content for free, and we don't sell advertising or influence. The only way for us to recoup any of our costs is through the patronage of you, our amazing audience.
 

Spread the Net
We are prepared to thank you graciously for your support, and we've established lots of different levels for people to contribute to our campaign. From t-shirts to photo books, shout-outs to swag bags, we think you'll find something to get excited about in our list of perks. On top of limited edition commemorative merchandise, select boosters contributing $35 or more will receive video recognition of their support from their favorite artists, posted publicly to their Facebook wall (or digital file). Those who pledge $50 or more have the chance to ask select festival performers anything they'd like to know about their work, while STATIK captures it all for the world to see. 
All boosters at any level will receive early access to future published Mechanismus-related video content.
 
Catch the Man
With your help, we can do more things faster. This is true of all episodes, but especially when trying to cover a five-day festival half a world away. We're ready to bring you all the live concert performances, exclusive band interviews and entertaining behind the scenes action you've come to expect from STATIK TV. You know you can count on us to deliver our unique brand of storytelling to the festivities in Seattle.
The question now is: can *we* count on you? Take a look at the perks we're offering and - if you can - contribute to the cause. If you want to support what we're doing, but can't afford to do so financially, there are other ways you can help. Make some noise. Help us boost the signal, for this campaign and for the series. There is strength in numbers. Together, we can make ourselves heard. 
Thanks for listening...and for your continued support.

<p>My name is Josh Isaac and in May I’m graduating from Ithaca College with a Cinema &amp; Photography B.S. degree and an Animation minor. I grew up watching every animated show and movie I could find with my dad and brother, and have always known that I wanted to make the kinds of fun and impactful stories that greeted us whenever we turned on the TV. My goal is to create stories with both heart and humor, connecting with audiences in the same way I felt connected to the cartoons I watched as a kid.</p>
<p>For my senior thesis, I am making a pilot for a cartoon I've been developing over the past year and a half. It is called ""Knights of Luminos"" and is a show about friendship, adventure, personal growth and the power of teamwork. Daisy, the enthusiastic warrior, Belch, the honorable goblin, and Chip, the happy go lucky wood elf come together to form our heroes, a team of Knights dedicated to protecting the people of the kingdom from monsters, criminals, supernatural forces and corruption. Together, they learn that everyone has something different to offer and that working as a team is the best way to solve problems and be heroic Knights.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Any and all funds we raise will go towards commissioning artists to help contribute to the project. We'll be able to have things like a fully realized series logo, beautifully drawn backgrounds, promotional posters and more. ALL of which you, as a donor, will be able to receive as .PNG files for a $20 donation.</p>

deal before the KL – BCN Trip Vlog starts, is that, if with your help we reach the goal to buy the stuff and motorcycle, to get ready for the next LYOS.TV trip, we will release 5 Chapters on the <strong>$ 5,555 usd goal.</strong></p><p>You already have:</p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwx0LA4pO2s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Chapter 01 – The

Living in the Car</p><p> </p><p><strong>That means that it would be $ 1,111 usd per chapter.</strong></p><p>In this procedure you guys will be motivated to see more and more with actual results in

us and spread this campaign with your friends, so later more people´s help will join us on the way to start the KL – BCN Vlog.</p><p>The faster you fund and spread this project, the faster you will have more Indonesian chapters and the faster the KL-BCN will come to live.</p><p> </p><p>After this first goal, the crowd funding will be on Demand, meaning that it will continue so we can keep

$ 17,777 usd of funding… little more than half of the total money that it´s needed to start and finish the new $ 33,000 usd 2 year Vlog until BCN.</strong></p><p>Half of money is enough to cover the expenses of many months with the weekly capsules on real time of the KL to BCN project.</p><p>After the “first season” with the 16 chapters, you will see that the main porpuse of LYOS.TV is to show reality…</p><p>Some chapters are about beautiful places, victories and summiting mountains… some about happy, relaxing and party times… some about failures… some others are sad and even about illness recoveries… learning at the end, that no matter what shit happens in our life... we have to get up again… yes, get up... always…</p><p><strong>The thing of LYOS.TV is showing you “travel life”… just as it is… with the goals, the dreams and the obstacles… with the ups and downs that we all have… because at the end, everybody knows that… life is not easy…</strong></p><p>So after the Indonesian Vlog, the real time travel capsules of the new Vlog will have a different format.</p><p>Each chapter of the fist Vlog resumed the story traveling time of months in 15 minutes.</p><p>Some were formed with 1 month of traveling, others with 2 months and another with 2 weeks… and even there is one chapter, done with 11 days of traveling time…</p><p>The new Video Blog format on weekly chapters to cover the Motorcycle Trip, will be that every Sunday, Lyos will grab the camera and tell you all what happened in the last week… from Monday to Sunday…</p><p>We think each chapter will be a 4 or 5 minutes video, illustrated with footage and photos… or maybe more with special edition and music.</p><p>But each chapter duration will depend on reality… on how entertaining were the places and the activities of that single week.</p><p>And the best thing in this new project, is that we can focus the chapters on more interesting details.</p><p>We will have seven days of storytelling in 5 minutes and we don´t have to rush taking away a lot of stuff and details, just to focus on the most amazing things of the trip…</p><p>And don´t get confused, the most amazing parts of the trip will be there... just this time the narration will get more detailed and personal…</p><p> </p><p><strong>A motorcycle trip from Kuala Lumpur to Barcelona by land… crossing 33 countries and some of the most

Malaysia to Spain... Video Blog from Kuala Lumpur to Barcelona, in which LYOS, a Video Producer/Climber/Explorer from Mexico, will be documenting everything that happens... We have to tell you the story really fast...Past:LYOS left Mexico 11 years ago and captured with his cameras 40 countries in 5 continents.In 2008 he started a Motorcycle Trip from KL to Madrid... but was interrupted by an Avalanche when he was climbing Mount Everest and canceled the trip...He did only 1/4 of the route...  Today:Now 9 years later, Lyos wants to finish that trip, documentating everything on weekly chapters on a Travel Vlog.So, this Crowd Funding is to get the trip started.Also you need to know what you will get for your money. For that, Lyos will upload the chapters of the Indonesian Vlog he did and edited to show that the KL - BCN Trip will be even more amazing, so you will support us to do it... And the Chapter 01 of LYOS.TV is here:

There are 16 Chapters in the Indonesian Vlog.
 Future:After funding the money for the new trip, Lyos will make weekly chapters in real time of all the new Motorcycle Vlog.Trip that will be crossing 33 countries starting from KL to Barcelona in 2018.We need your HELP for that... please support LYOS.TV to make this happen... If you can´t Help us with Donations or in YouCaring.com/LyosTVplease Help us Sharing this Campaing with your Family and Friends or the video.https://youtu.be/ouzTt_HbHhoAll the Complete Details of the Perks for Supporting LYOS.TV in this Link:https://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/757c3955 So, that was the short version of the story... now, because we know you want them, here are all the details of the project...Lyos left Mexico and has been 11 years on the road... and in that time he has done some weird stuff: Traveled from Acapulco to Cancun by Bicyclehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNBapesTV5s Motorcycle, Car and Jeep Trips around Mexicohttps://youtu.be/5Wv2frYSIBc?t=385https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PORpqhNCj0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yITWaC10xqI Running with Bulls, Rappelling the Basement of Swallows and Experiencing ""Flying"" just like an ancient Mexica with the Papantla Flyershttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxm0ywyCvchttps://youtu.be/al3ncaCK_EM?t=197 Travelled the important Maya sites from Mexico to Costa Rica by car doing 25,000 kmshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cJTZQX5ot8 Produced, presented and edited Extreme Sports capsules for a TV show in Melbournehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CDUSpPGagYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcssGFgnOE4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiWCDJDsIkw Travelled in a Motorcycle Chopper in 11 countries of Southeast Asia for 33,000 kmshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_oa-lVAEhQ Climbed to the Summit of 38 mountains, including almost getting killed by an avalanche and losing a finger to get to the Top of Mount Everest His cameras already got him detained in 4 different countries and now he is a motivational speaker… doesn´t drink, smoke or do drugs...All these weird activities are included in the first chapter of the LYOS.TV project...  These are the Social Media the project already has:   LYOS.TV        LyosTV         LyosTV         LyosTV         LyosTV         LyosTV    FB Group        FB Page        Indiegogo        PayPal        Lyos.TV@lyos.tv         We also have a team of translators totally ready and willing to put subtitles on LYOS.TVSo far we have Spanish, English, Indonesian, French, Russian, German, Italian, Dutch, Finnish, Polish, Turkish and Catalan.They are just waiting for LYOS.TV to be supported by you guys... so LYOS.TV can reach as much people as possible all over the World by being subtitled in 11 or more languages... ​ If later when the chapters get released, you can´t find the subtitles in one of the languages listed, it means we still need help to do them... you can also be part of the translation team to help in these or other languages and join LYOS.TV If you want please contact us.You will be part of our VIP contribuition community and will give you credits with your links in the LYOS.TV Web Site and YouTube video descriptions of each video... just like this:LYOS.TV/who  This new project in 2018 will be a Motorcycle Trip from Kuala Lumpur to Barcelona.Including all kind of activities like Extreme Sports, Touristic Spots, High Mountains, Beautiful Beaches, Weird Places and Visiting Orphanages... crossing a Total of 33 Countries.1. - Malaysia2. - Thailand3. - Cambodia4. - Vietnam5. - Laos6. - Myanmar7.- India8.- Pakistan9.- Afghanistan10.- Tajikistan11.- Kyrgyzstan12.- Kazakhstan13. - Uzbekistan14. - Turkmenistan15. - Iran16. - Georgia17. - Turkey18. - Greece19. - Bulgaria20. - Romania21. - Ukraine22. - Hungary23. - Slovakia24. - Poland25. - Czech Republic26. - Austria27. - Italy28. - Switzerland29. - Germany30. - Netherlands31. - Belgium32. - France33. - SpainThis route will take, approximately, 2 years to accomplish all the 33 countries.Is not an easy route and could change because of many external factors like political problems... still, it will start in 2018 from Malaysia and will finish in Spain… maybe in 2020. After 11 years travelling outside Mexico and his experience in the last motorcycle trip in Asia that lasted 20 months… Video that we showed you before... Lyos calculated that he needs $ 33,000 usd for this KL - BCN motorcycle trip.Funding Money:Cost of travelling per month = $ 1,000 usd.That was calculated on a daily basis: $10 usd for food, $10 usd for petrol and $10 usd for accommodation.That means $ 30 usd x 30 days… so, $ 900 usd. But there are always some extra expenses and to make it easier, we will say $ 1,000 usd per month.2 Year Trip = 24 months = $ 24,000 usd daily travelling expenses.Cost of the second hand motorcycle and international Carnet de Passage papers, so the motorcycle can cross borders with Lyos = $ 5,000 usd.Cost of the Video and Action Cameras = $ 2,000 usd.Web Site to keep you informed with chapters and photos updated all the trip = $ 1,000 usd.Costs for Visas, Subtitling, Repairs, Indiegogo Fees and more = $ 1,000 usd.Total Cost of the 2 Year Vlog Trip from Kuala Lumpur to Barcelona = $ 33,000 usd. Doing this project on a budget trying to save money is important.$10 usd food and $10 usd accommodation, will force Lyos to maintain a simple more connected to the place and people´s day to day life.Meaning that sometimes he will have to share rooms in hostels, eat street food or bargain about any touristic service or expeditions on the trip…All these situations will force him to meet people and make new friends everywhere… making the stories of the trip richer and unique…  Since you don´t know what to expect of this motorcycle trip, we are dividing the funding of LYOS.TV new Vlog in 2 stages.The first stage is already this crowd funding from Indiegogo to start the Motorcycle Trip to Barcelona, asking for the first $ 5,555 usd. That´s just to cover the 2 principal costs:1. - Buying a second hand Chopper Motorcycle for = $ 3,555 usd2. - Buying the new Video Camera and the Action Camera for = $ 2,000 usd The prices for the cameras online and also in many electronic stores already checked in Kuala Lumpur, tells us that $ 2,000 usd are enough to cover the cost of buying them new.The second hand motorcycle price is more difficult to calculate.Lyos checked prices the last time he was in some places of Malaysia and KL, and a 5 year old Chopper was between $ 3,000 and $ 3,500 usdSo we will put the cost on $ 3,555 usd to make sure he can buy it and also because 555 is Lyos favorite number. He knows that reaching this first goal to buy this is not going to be easy…Also even a little bit harder if you guys don´t know what to expect about all the journey or if you are doubting if Lyos work is worth it or not.The only thing that we can do, if you didn´t watched it before, is show you the Chapter 1 of the first LYOS.TV project.A Video Blog of Indonesia in Spanish with English and French subtitles, totally produced and edited by Lyos.LYOS.TV - Chapter 01 – The Dream… This chapter and all the Indonesian Vlog, has no script or camera crew, is a Solo Trip filmed in 10 countries: Spain, England, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the narrations are based in Indonesia, with chapters in Borneo, Sumatra, Java and Bali.  The story is exactly as it happened... without enough money, without rules and without plans… has 16 Chapters… and the list is here:1       The Dream…2       See You Later3       Return to Melbourne4       The Project5       Living in the Car6       Mount Cook Fall7       Sri Lanka Fix8       Philippines Fall9       A Better Year10     Exploring Borneo11      Sumatra Fall12     Thay Relyoaded13.1  Crossing to... Bali13.2  Macho Motorcycle Dream Trip13.3  The Immortal13.4   Ubud  All the chapters will be something between 14 - 15 minutes… but remember that the most important thing of this project, is the TRUTH.So, we will try to make the chapters duration as standard as possible, even though sometimes reality is way different than expected and we can´t control it.Still, we will never bore our viewers with a chapter that is longer than it should be… or so fast that you can´t enjoy it...So, the first deal before the KL – BCN Trip Vlog starts, is that, if with your help we reach the goal to buy the stuff and motorcycle, to get ready for the next LYOS.TV trip, we will release 5 Chapters on the $ 5,555 usd goal.You already have:Chapter 01 – The Dream… So after this is done, we will release:Chapter 02 - See You LaterChapter 03 - Return to MelbourneChapter 04 - The ProjectChapter 05 - Living in the Car That means that it would be $ 1,111 usd per chapter.In this procedure you guys will be motivated to see more and more with actual results in hand, while the real project that you are funding has not even started yet.Meaning that you are receiving and being part of 2 Vlogs for the funding of 1…This has to convince you to help us and spread this campaign with your friends, so later more people´s help will join us on the way to start the KL – BCN Vlog.The faster you fund and spread this project, the faster you will have more Indonesian chapters and the faster the KL-BCN will come to live. After this first goal, the crowd funding will be on Demand, meaning that it will continue so we can keep releasing the chapters 6, 7, 8, 9… and every $ 1,111 usd we will upload one more until reaching number 16.  When we reach that point, LYOS.TV will have $ 17,777 usd of funding… little more than half of the total money that it´s needed to start and finish the new $ 33,000 usd 2 year Vlog until BCN.Half of money is enough to cover the expenses of many months with the weekly capsules on real time of the KL to BCN project.After the “first season” with the 16 chapters, you will see that the main porpuse of LYOS.TV is to show reality…Some chapters are about beautiful places, victories and summiting mountains… some about happy, relaxing and party times… some about failures… some others are sad and even about illness recoveries… learning at the end, that no matter what shit happens in our life... we have to get up again… yes, get up... always…The thing of LYOS.TV is showing you “travel life”… just as it is… with the goals, the dreams and the obstacles… with the ups and downs that we all have… because at the end, everybody knows that… life is not easy…So after the Indonesian Vlog, the real time travel capsules of the new Vlog will have a different format.Each chapter of the fist Vlog resumed the story traveling time of months in 15 minutes.Some were formed with 1 month of traveling, others with 2 months and another with 2 weeks… and even there is one chapter, done with 11 days of traveling time…The new Video Blog format on weekly chapters to cover the Motorcycle Trip, will be that every Sunday, Lyos will grab the camera and tell you all what happened in the last week… from Monday to Sunday…We think each chapter will be a 4 or 5 minutes video, illustrated with footage and photos… or maybe more with special edition and music.But each chapter duration will depend on reality… on how entertaining were the places and the activities of that single week.And the best thing in this new project, is that we can focus the chapters on more interesting details.We will have seven days of storytelling in 5 minutes and we don´t have to rush taking away a lot of stuff and details, just to focus on the most amazing things of the trip…And don´t get confused, the most amazing parts of the trip will be there... just this time the narration will get more detailed and personal… A motorcycle trip from Kuala Lumpur to Barcelona by land… crossing 33 countries and some of the most difficult places in the world… alone… telling the story as it goes on a limited budget... trust LYOS.TV, we are sure it will be amazing and totally worth it.  The motorcycle gives a different perspective when you travel…It is freedom… and gives you the opportunity to get to the corners where no foreigner or even average locals go… just because we can… and just because going to hidden and unknown places, is exactly the way in which we can use the word ""explore""…So let´s go and see what happens… let´s discover real people, real places and real stories…Doesn´t matter in what you are interested… Rivers, Temples, Waterfalls, Animals, Religions, Villages, Mountains, Jungles, Sports, Orphanages, Beaches…Whatever you are looking for, the motorcycle is destined to take us there and beyond to find something new…And this time, even with the option that if you are passionate about something else… or you know anything interesting somewhere… an orphanage or a special secret place along the route… write us... we will make sure it will be soon on LYOS.TV… Amazing Trip that with your Help… will be a Reality very Soon…

vez en el 2020.Después de 11 años viajando fuera de México y su experiencia con el viaje en Moto anterior en Asia que duró 20 meses... Video que ya les enseñamos antes... Lyos ha calculado que necesita $33,000 usd para el viaje de KL a BCN en moto.Recaudación de Dinero:Costo de viajar por mes = $ 1,000 usd.Eso fue calculado con gastos por día: $10 usd para comida, $10 usd para gasolina y $10 usd para el hotel.Eso significa que son $ 30 usd x 30 días… $ 900 usd. Pero siempre hay algunos gastos extras y para hacerlo más fácil, diremos que son $ 1,000 usd por mes.2 Años de Viaje = 24 meses = $ 24,000 usd de gastos de viaje.Costo de una motocicleta usada y el Carnet de Passage internacional, para que la moto pueda cruzar fronteras con Lyos = $ 5,000 usd.Costo de la Cámara de Video y la Action Camera = $ 2,000 usd.Página Web para mantenerlos informados con los capítulos y fotos actualizadas del viaje = $ 1,000 usd.Costo de Visas, Subtítulos, Reparaciones, Indiegogo y más = $ 1,000 usd.Costo Total Vlog de Viaje de 2 Años de Kuala Lumpur a Barcelona = $ 33,000 usd. Realizar éste proyecto con presupuesto intentando ahorrar dinero es importante.$10 usd para comida y $10 usd de hotel, hará que Lyos mantenga una vida simple y más conectada con las personas locales en su día a día.Algunas veces tendrá que compartir cuartos en hostales, comer en la calle o regatear cualquier actividad o servicio turístico o expediciones en el viaje…Todas estas situaciones lo forzarán a conocer gente y hacer nuevos amigos en todas partes... haciendo que las historias en el viaje sean más valiosas y únicas...  Ya que ustedes no saben que esperar de este viaje en moto, vamos a dividir la recaudación de fondos del Vlog LYOS.TV en 2 etapas.La primera etapa será ésta campaña en Indiegogo para empezar el Viaje en Moto a Barcelona, pidiendo los primeros $ 5,555 usd. Eso es solamente para cubrir los 2 costos principales:1. - Comprar la Motocicleta Chopper usada por = $ 3,555 usd2. - Comprar la Cámara de Video y la Action Camera por = $ 2,000 usd Los precios de las cámaras en línea y también en varias tiendas electrónicas de Kuala Lumpur, nos dice que $ 2,000 usd son suficientes para cubrir el costo de comprarlas nuevas.El precio de la moto usada será más difícil de calcular.Lyos checó precios la última vez que estuvo en algunos lugares de Malasia y KL, y una Chopper con 5 años de uso estaba entre $ 3,000 y $ 3,500 usdAsí que pondremos el precio en $ 3,555 usd para asegurarnos de que se pueda comprar además de que 555 es el número favorito de Lyos. El sabe que alcanzar esa primer meta para comprar ésto no será fácil…E incluso un poco difícil si ustedes no saben qué va a resultar de este viaje o si están dudando si el trabajo de Lyos vale la pena o no.Por ello si no lo vieron antes, lo primero que queremos enseñarles es el Capítulo 01 del primer proyecto de LYOS.TVUn Video Blog de Indonesia en Español con subtítulos en Inglés y Francés por ahora, totalmente producido y editado por Lyos.LYOS.TV - Chapter 01 – The Dream…

 
Éste capítulo y todo el Vlog de Indonesia, no tiene script ni asistentes de cámara, es un viaje en solitario grabado en 10 países: España, Inglaterra, Australia, Nueva Zelanda, Sri Lanka, Malasia, Filipinas, Singapur, Tailandia y las narraciones fueron grabadas en Indonesia, con capítulos en Borneo, Sumatra, Java y Bali.  La historia es exactamente como se vivió... sin dinero extra, sin reglas y sin planes... tiene 16 Capítulos… y son éstos:1       The Dream…2       See You Later3       Return to Melbourne4      The Project5       Living in the Car6       Mount Cook Fall7       Sri Lanka Fix8       Philippines Fall9       A Better Year10     Exploring Borneo11      Sumatra Fall12     Thay Relyoaded13.1   Crossing to... Bali13.2  Macho Motorcycle Dream Trip13.3  The Immortal13.4   Ubud  Todos los capítulos durarán entre 14 y 15 minutos… pero recuerden que lo más importante de éste proyecto, es la VERDAD.Así, trataremos de hacer la duración de los capítulos lo más estándares posible, aunque algunas veces la realidad sea muy diferente a lo que se esperaba y no la podamos controlar.Aún así, jamás aburriremos al espectador con capítulos más largos de lo que deberían ser... o tan rápidos que no los puedan disfrutar...Entonces el primer trato antes de que el Vlog de KL a BCN empiece, es que si nos ayudan a alcanzar la meta para comprar la moto y preparar el siguiente viaje de LYOS.TV, les daremos 5 Capítulos al llegar a la meta de los $ 5,555 usd.Ustedes ya vieron el primero:Chapter 01 – The Dream… Después de  alcanzar la meta, les subiremos:Chapter 02 - See You LaterChapter 03 - Return to MelbourneChapter 04 - The ProjectChapter 05 - Living in the Car Eso significa que serán $ 1,111 usd por capítulo.En ese esquema siempre estarán motivados para ver más capítulos, sabiendo que lo que tendrán será de calidad, mientras que el proyecto que de verdad están financiando ni siquiera ha empezado.En pocas palabras les estamos dando y forman parte de 2 Vlogs por financiar 1…Esto debe convencerlos de ayudarnos y compartir ésta campaña con sus amigos para que más personas nos ayuden y se nos unan para empezar el Vlog de KL a BCN. Entre más rápido financien y compartan éste proyecto, más rápido tendrán más capítulos de Indonesia y más rápido podrá empezar el viaje de KL a BCN. Después de ésta primer meta, la campaña crowd funding seguirá on Demand, lo que significa que continuará para seguir financiándonos y podamos darles los siguientes capítulos 6, 7, 8, 9… y así cada vez que juntemos $ 1,111 usd se subirá uno más hasta llegar al 16.  Cuando lleguemos a ese punto, LYOS.TV tendrá $ 17,777 usd financiados… un poco más de la mitad del dinero total que se necesita para empezar y terminar el nuevo Vlog de $ 33,000 usd de viaje por 2 años hasta BCN.La mitad del dinero es suficiente para cubrir los gastos de varios meses de viaje con los capítulos semanales en tiempo real del proyecto de KL a BCN.Después la ""primer temporada” con 16 capítulos, ya habrán visto que el objetivo principal de LYOS.TV es mostrar la realidad…Algunos capítulos son acerca de lugares chidos, victorias y escaladas de montañas… algunos son felices, relajados y de fiesta... algunos de fracasos... algunos otros tristes y recuperándose de enfermedades... aprendiendo que al final, no importa la chinga que nos ponga la vida... nos tenemos que levantar otra vez... así es, levantarse...  siempre...En LYOS.TV queremos mostrarles lo que es “estar de viaje”… tal cual es… con las metas, los sueños y los obstáculos… con los altibajos que todos tenemos... porque al final, todos sabemos que… la vida no es fácil…Así que después del Vlog de Indonesia, las cápsulas de viaje en tiempo real del nuevo Vlog tendrán un formato distinto.Cada capítulo del primer Vlog resume la historia de tiempo de viaje de meses en 15 minutos.Algunos se hicieron con 1 mes de viaje, otros con 2 meses y otro con 2 semanas… e incluso hay un capítulo que se hizo con 11 días de tiempo de viaje…El nuevo formato del Video Blog semanal para el Viaje en Moto, será que todos los Domingos, Lyos agarrará la cámara y les contará todo lo que ha pasado en esa semana… de Lunes a Domingo…Creemos que cada capítulo será de 4 o 5 minutes de video, ilustrado con imágenes y fotos… o tal vez más con edición especial y música.Pero la duración de cada capítulo dependerá de la realidad… de que tan entretenidos fueron los lugares y las actividades de esa semana.Y la mejor parte de éste nuevo proyecto, es que podremos enfocar los capítulos en los detalles más interesantes.Tendremos 7 días de historias que contar en 5 minutos y no tenemos la presión de quitar muchas cosas y detalles, sólo para enfocarnos en las cosas increíbles del viaje...Y no se confundan, las cosas más increíbles del viaje van a estar... sólo que ahora la narrativa será aún más detallada y personal... Un viaje en motocicleta de Kuala Lumpur a Barcelona por tierra... cruzando 33 países y algunos de los lugares más difíciles del mundo... sólo... contando la historia tal como pasó con presupuesto limitado... confía en LYOS.TV, estamos seguros que valdrá la pena y será increíble.  La motocicleta te da una perspectiva diferente cuando viajas…Es completa libertad… y te da la oportunidad de llegar a lugares remotos donde ningún extranjero ni los locales normalmente van... sólo porque podemos ir... y sólo porque ir a esos lugares ocultos y desconocidos, es exactamente la forma en la que podemos usar la palabra ""explorar""...Así que vamos a ver qué pasa… descubramos personas, lugares e historias reales…No importa que es lo que te interese… Ríos, Templos, Cascadas, Animales, Religiones, Aldeas, Montañas, Selvas, Deportes, Culturas, Playas... Lo que sea que estés buscando, la motocicleta está destinada a llevarnos allá y aún mucho más lejos, para encontrar algo nuevo…Y ésta vez, con la opción de que si te apasiona alguna otra cosa... o sabes de algún lugar interesante por ahí... algún orfanatorio o algo por la ruta especial y secreto... escríbenos... lo visitaremos para ponerlo próximamente en LYOS.TV… Un Viaje Increíble que con tu Ayuda… será una Realidad muy Pronto…  ℒ५٥೭   ​Si no puedes Ayudarnos con Donaciones o en YouCaring.com/LyosTVpor favor Comparte este Crowdfunding con tus Familiares y Amigos o el video.https://youtu.be/ouzTt_HbHhoTodos los detalles de los Premios por Apoyar a LYOS.TV en éste Link:https://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/757c3955",81.0,5,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>About Centered Web Series:</strong></p>
<p>Drawing on personal accounts, 'Centered' addresses mental health, recovery, and the stigma surrounding them. We strive to give a window into how limited resources are for women of all backgrounds and the difficulty of obtaining strategized programs and the help and support that's needed for recovery. With so many facilities underfunded and programs cut from budgets across the country, we aim to bring these issues to the forefront of 'Centered' through comedy and complex characters; and as creators we aim to use this as a platform for voices that are not heard, as well as showcasing Chicago's talent in the comedy community.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>Because we are producing, writing, and acting in this project; we are aware that the timeline for the completed episodes will be a challenge. We are ready to take on that challenge with a stellar, hardworking team: a DP, editor, sound engineer, and talented cast that brings our text to life through extended improvisational background; they truly make our jobs easier. We are trying to pull from as much of our professional on-set experience as possible and can guarantee that even though this is not a union project, it will be produced and directed like one. With block shooting over the month of July, we will hammer out all of our scenes in an organized way that makes sense for the creative team involved, and will ideally make editing easier. Our editor is top-notch and will be on set as much as possible, which ultimately will make the editing process smoother and timely-- resulting in a quicker timeline for us to drop the remainder of the nine episode season of 'Centered'. We have the passionate, creative team to tell this important story; we just need the funding to do so. After self-producing the pilot, we have a better sense of what we need to make this project a reality.. and it's you!</p>

<p><i>On Site</i> is a musical travel series about the cultures that inspired the Disney Princesses™. This past spring, we traveled to ten countries: The USA, England, Scotland, France, Germany, Denmark, Norway, India, China, and Fiji. For each country we did an on location music video of a Disney song, and an interview to learn a little bit more about the culture. </p>
<p>I began working on On Site over a year ago, wanting to put my own spin on the Disney music videos I'd seen circulating around youtube. I was also very much inspired by the Netflix series <i>Sense8</i>. As an actress and singer of color, of course I loved its diversity. However, what really struck me about the series was its joyfulness. It is a celebration of all walks of life. I truly believe that we need more inclusive and uplifting media in a time of so much divide. Not only does Disney have a global audience, but especially in recent years, its characters come from all over the world. It felt like the perfect medium. (Also, I've always wanted to be a princess.) </p>

</div></div>","On Site is a musical travel series about the cultures that inspired the Disney Princesses™. This past spring, we traveled to ten countries: The USA, England, Scotland, France, Germany, Denmark, Norway, India, China, and Fiji. For each country we did an on location music video of a Disney song, and an interview to learn a little bit more about the culture. 
I began working on On Site over a year ago, wanting to put my own spin on the Disney music videos I'd seen circulating around youtube. I was also very much inspired by the Netflix series Sense8. As an actress and singer of color, of course I loved its diversity. However, what really struck me about the series was its joyfulness. It is a celebration of all walks of life. I truly believe that we need more inclusive and uplifting media in a time of so much divide. Not only does Disney have a global audience, but especially in recent years, its characters come from all over the world. It felt like the perfect medium. (Also, I've always wanted to be a princess.)

<h3>Why IndieGOGO?</h3>
<p>storybooth is a by-kids-for-kids platform. It is authentic, organic, and co-created – the community makes it as good as it is. storybooth is committed to going anywhere that the audience needs it to go, and promises to cover the topics that the community wants to hear and talk about.</p>
<p>That’s why we decided to do this, to allow the widest possible community of people who care deeply about young people, and the stories they share, to be a part of what makes storybooth as good as it is – a powerful community of backers – and to make it better.</p>
<p>We have watched the power of our community of young people elevate storybooth, and we have watched storybooth, in turn, elevate them. </p>
<p>We believe our community of backers can do the same, allowing us to continue to start and be in the tough topics and conversations that young people want and need, and to let the audience guide us where they need us to go.</p>
<h3>What we will do with the funds.</h3>
<p>Every story that we are able to animate and post, each week, brings millions of kids to the platform. </p>
<p>There are so many stories that need to be told and shared and we can't afford to stop being that platform and channel for young people. We didn't expect to receive over 40,000 stories from kids all over the world in such a short time, or that we would grow our audience this quickly. </p>
<p>Kids want to see more of their stories animated and we want to give that to them. The more stories we produce, the bigger the impact we can make.  </p>
<p>That's why we need your help - to move fast, animate more amazing stories told by amazing kids, and share them with the world. </p>
<p>Reaching our goal will let us put more stories into production, and impact more and more kids. Exceeding it will help us impact even more! This is Indiegogo after all. We could exceed our goal, and all have an amazing story to tell!</p>
<h3>storybooth accolades.</h3>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I am Evie Marie Warner. I am an indie filmmaker from Dayton, Ohio. I have been doing short films for several years. I love creating content that makes people think, educate or laugh.  Sometimes all at once. </p>
<p>I am currently working on a superhero web series that will do a little bit of both. Super Z will consist of around 3 to four roughly  ten minute comedic female centric episodes that highlights the rise and fall of a woman named Zoe, known as Super Z.  Just like Batman, and scores of other DC and Marvel heroes, she thinks her father is dead. But what if it was all a lie?</p>
<p>What is exciting is that we will be able to use our filming location to help other filmmakers and small businesses in the community.  </p>
<p>Thanks to the generousity of friends and family we already  have a 9 x 13 green screen,  new softbox lights, and a new zoom recorder with lavs. We are going to need a floor air conditioner. We are also making some DIY Sound Absorption Panels</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pABvTWSxOes&amp;app=desktop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pABvTWSxOes&amp;amp...</a></p>
<p>We think you will enjoy watching Zoe cope with facing her new reality with heart and humor as we parody the biggest tropes and themes of our beloved comic books that is like an adult version of Henry Danger and The Thundermans.</p>
<p>We hope you will join Team Z and help us make a fun and exciting show for the kid in all of us. And by supporting our campaign you are also going to help other artist needing studio space but don’t have hundreds or even thousands of dollars to rent a professional studio space.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For this superhero comedy to be successful we are going to need the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Costumes which will be about half of our over all budget.</li>
<li>Floor air conditioner</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li> Rental equipment</li>
<li>Studio space monthly rental cost</li>
<li>Post-Production such as sub-titles </li>
<li>Possible submission to festivals. </li>
</ol>
<p>If we make more than our $500.00 dollar goal, we will be to use that on costumes and food and better, highter quality absorption panels.  If we get $800.00, We can put some of that towards a camera other creatives can use.  If we get a $1,000.00, we would put that towards greater sound insoluation of the space.  </p>
<p>We have opportunities for your name to be permanently displayed on our wall, letting people know who made this unique space available to the filmmaking community. You can also name a future character and be part of a special facebook group where you can continue to  follow our journey. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting our efforts, you will help providing a unique space that can be used by other small productions to make shorts,  student film projects, and small business to make youtube videos.  Also, help support diversity in film by supporting a female  director. Every gift is making artistic expression thru digital media more accessible for filmmakers of all levels. </p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi! I am Evie Marie Warner. I am an indie filmmaker from Dayton, Ohio. I have been doing short films for several years. I love creating content that makes people think, educate or laugh.  Sometimes all at once. 
I am currently working on a superhero web series that will do a little bit of both. Super Z will consist of around 3 to four roughly  ten minute comedic female centric episodes that highlights the rise and fall of a woman named Zoe, known as Super Z.  Just like Batman, and scores of other DC and Marvel heroes, she thinks her father is dead. But what if it was all a lie?
What is exciting is that we will be able to use our filming location to help other filmmakers and small businesses in the community.  
Thanks to the generousity of friends and family we already  have a 9 x 13 green screen,  new softbox lights, and a new zoom recorder with lavs. We are going to need a floor air conditioner. We are also making some DIY Sound Absorption Panels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pABvTWSxOes&amp...
We think you will enjoy watching Zoe cope with facing her new reality with heart and humor as we parody the biggest tropes and themes of our beloved comic books that is like an adult version of Henry Danger and The Thundermans.
We hope you will join Team Z and help us make a fun and exciting show for the kid in all of us. And by supporting our campaign you are also going to help other artist needing studio space but don’t have hundreds or even thousands of dollars to rent a professional studio space.

What We Need & What You Get
For this superhero comedy to be successful we are going to need the following:

Costumes which will be about half of our over all budget.
Floor air conditioner
Food
 Rental equipment
Studio space monthly rental cost
Post-Production such as sub-titles 
Possible submission to festivals. 

If we make more than our $500.00 dollar goal, we will be to use that on costumes and food and better, highter quality absorption panels.  If we get $800.00, We can put some of that towards a camera other creatives can use.  If we get a $1,000.00, we would put that towards greater sound insoluation of the space.  
We have opportunities for your name to be permanently displayed on our wall, letting people know who made this unique space available to the filmmaking community. You can also name a future character and be part of a special facebook group where you can continue to  follow our journey. 

The Impact
By supporting our efforts, you will help providing a unique space that can be used by other small productions to make shorts,  student film projects, and small business to make youtube videos.  Also, help support diversity in film by supporting a female  director. Every gift is making artistic expression thru digital media more accessible for filmmakers of all levels. 

Risks & Challenges
 I have made a total of six films.  I have never been invilved in a film that never made it out of post-production once shooting wrapped.  Some times that can be a huge challenge for filmmakers.  But whether a pip bursts at a film location, an actor drops out or an unexpected illness, I have learned to adapt and overcome these obstacles.

After take a film course in his last year of high school he attended the motion picture arts program at Capilano University.

<p>Since then he has co-founded the company MiTribe Productions with actor/producer Rowan Jang and is excited to be developing the animated series Gator Greg.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to produce our sizzle reel we will need $6,615.00 to cover expenses.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Budget Breakdown</h3>
<p>Total budget estimate (w/GST): $6,615.00</p>
<p>Pre-production: $1200</p>
<p>Producer: $400</p>
<p>Storyboard Artist: $2800</p>
<p>Sound Designer: $200</p>
<p>Editor: $400</p>
<p>AFX Compositor/VFX: $1200</p>
<p>Post Materials: $100</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our perks range from a personal thank you from our recording studio to an executive producer credit.</p>
<p>If our goal isn't reached, the money we do raise will go towards character animation and we will bootstrap the rest, but we believe you would much rather our reel looks the best it can. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The tagline for the show is ""old souls stay young forever."" The Gator Greg story emulates the power of youth and the importance of younger generations to the world. This is at it's heart a show about family and we think it is very important to try and get younger viewers to respond to this message. Being an animation, the issues Greg faces that mirror society are far more digestible to viewers young and old.</p>
<p>The Gator Greg world clearly and vigorously mirrors societies we see today in the real world. Being a cartoon it can be easily digested by audiences young and old who may turn a blind eye to the obvious problems in the world. Many people today in western society believe that we are in a post-prejudice environment. Gator Greg is here to prove that far more progress is in order to create an ideal world.</p>
<p>Greg’s world constantly has implicit or explicit themes of tolerance and prejudice, which young people need to hear. They’ve had some exposure to these themes in recent movies, but a televised series would be able to present multiple examples in more in-depth ways, and more frequently. Writers of the show would also be able to take examples from real-life incidents and apply them to the story to an extent. This creates a parallel that is easy to understand for young minds. Issues that affect the children of today would be portrayed.</p>
<p>Portrayal is important. The creators of Gator Greg have put a lot of effort into making the characters’ experiences representative, including issues that many children and adults have faced, such as childhood trauma or prejudice, or even extreme experiences such as neglect and or other forms of abuse. Like everyone, all the characters in this show have their own flaws and we as the audience are waiting for them to redeem themselves so we too may feel their victory to inspire our everyday actions.</p>
<p>It also features a gritty yet escapist tone that hasn’t been present since the Batman Animated Series. This aspect could appeal to older audiences looking for a film noir edge with a borderline anti-hero at its helm to harken them back to a time when western 2D animation played in a majestic fashion such as older Warner Brother and Disney projects.</p>
<p>The culture manifested for this series stems from a multitude of music genres and important eras in human history that would invite fans from of a great number of demographic divisions and sub-divisions. Being a fictional world of animals, there are many opportunities to relive iconic periods from all ages and in turn concoct original artistic societies and sub-cultures.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s a show about characters doing the right thing, even if it’s not what their society allows. It’s fun, entertaining, and real, and could inspire a whole new generation of social activism.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If the show is to go into production, there is a risk of losing a great deal of creative involvement. Our plan to combat this possibility is to prove our capabilities via execution of the sizzle reel.</p>

<h3>What's the Story, Morning Glory?</h3>
<p><i>Clickbait: The Show</i> is about a twenty-three year old writer named Spencer Silla, who' s having trouble balancing her creative freedom with the constant need for shameless self-promotion in our modern age. She creates a new YouTube account out of a need for some creative fulfillment and is shocked to find Elton Tube, son of the president of YouTube, in her apartment offering her a job. Elton explains that he and his siblings, Joplin and Joel Tube, are in a race to inherit the Tube family fortune and whoever makes the most popular channel wins it all. Now Elton and Spencer must gather a crew of filmmakers and start churning out videos as fast as they can, all the while forming love triangles and exploring the city.</p>
<h3><strong>So who's this Birney boy I'm hearing about?</strong></h3>
<p>Alright! Awesome, you've read this far, so that must mean I'm doing something right!</p>
<p>Before I talk about me, it'd be wrong of me not to give a huge thank you to our photographer Nathalie Basoski (@not.a.russian.spy and @nathaliebasoski), our animator Hyo Bin Kang  @hyoncebinaj), and our graphic designer Summer Synder (@summercsynder and <a href=""http://www.ssnyderdesign.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ssnyderdesign.com</a>).</p>
<p>Most of you already know me, but Malcolm said he'd probably share this with his grandma, so this is for her!</p>
<p>My name is Ephraim Birney. I am an actor, writer and aspiring Topher Grace look-a-like. Most of my credits are theatrical, where I seem to have been typecast as the character with no lines. You can also see me smoking weed in <i>The Americans</i> or getting stabbed in the neck in <i>Gotham</i>. Truly as journeyed a career as they come.</p>
<p>""So Ephraim,"" you might ask, ""Why are you going through all the trouble of writing and producing a web-series if you're so artistically fulfilled by the auditions you don't get?"" It's because this show is about more than me now. Sure, when I started writing, I was doing it to give myself a nice part to act. I'd get my friends together, we'd laugh at my self-deprecation and then we'd be done. But over the last couple of months, Clickbait has turned into a community of sorts. All of a sudden I was laughing and working with people I hadn't seen for years. Friends of mine who hadn't ever met were collaborating.<i> Clickbait: The Show</i> is going to be a home for the aspiring artist. For the actors who don't look like Emma Stone and Chris Hemsworth. For the filmmakers who want to experiment and the editors who have another idea entirely. I want to build a staircase for all of us who don't have a VIP pass into Hollywood, and every donation and helping hand gives us another step to climb.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Soooooo how much are we talking here?</h3>
<p>Well, as you can see with my very candid reaction to our producer, we are asking for thirty thousand dollars. If you're still reading this after that number, then you've given me the benefit of the doubt and I will explain myself. All of us working on this show are abiding by the philosophy that if we do something, we're gonna do it well. Pretty much all of the footage you will see on this campaign was filmed four times. And we're still not happy with it. Now I'm perfectly fine working for free, but I can't do this all on my own. We need equipment, we need transportation, editing, pre-production, post-production, we wanted to give everyone custom Air Jordans, but honestly I'll be thankful if I can get everyone fed. Thirty thousand dollars is what we need to take this from a student film to something worthy of television.</p>
<p>But we at Clickbait aren't the only ones benefitting from your donations. We have plenty of nifty little perks for you to enjoy! I know what you all are really excited about; my desperate attempts to please you. </p>
<p>We've got a wide variety perks to offer to our generous donors, ranging from a special thank you in the credits to full-on cameo appearances. My personal favorite is the custom clickbait article. With a donation of a hundred dollars or more, I will compose a clickbait article tailor-made for you and your achievements in a field of your choosing! The best part is that it's not a t-shirt that you'll never wear!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How will History view Clickbait?</h3>
<p>Let's talk about impact. Our objective here at Clickbait: The Show is, and always will be, the creation of a giant robot mech suit that I can use to fight crime. We just have a very roundabout way of doing that. No, really, as nice as that would be, we're setting our first goals a little more realistically. Our hope is to use whatever we raise here to fund the production of at least one of the planned episodes. With a pilot filmed, edited, and looking nice and glossy, we'll have something to pitch to networks and online media outlets.</p>
<p>This whole journey is the first time most of us involved have attempted something like this. So I encourage everyone to use the show as a learning experience. That way we get plenty of fresh ideas and we develop something of a style unique to us. We're all working non-stop and everyday we get a little better, it's a very exciting feeling!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risky Business and Business Risks</h3>
<p>I'd say the risk is not raising enough money, but as my team has made abundantly clear to me, we're making this show whether you all want it or not. So if we raise five dollars, we will make this with tape recorders and Nokia phone cameras. And as hardcore and edgy as that might sound, I'd really appreciate it if you guys donated so we won't have to come to that.</p>
<p>The money obviously is important in regards to quality of our product, but it's also important to me to pay back all the hard work that our team has consistently provided. Everyone went into this expecting nothing in return for their work, and of course your donations go straight to the necessities first, but I want to treat this little family right and at least keep them fed during film shoots.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How can I do more?</h3>
<p>Of course not everyone can give money, because not everyone has money to give. I fall into that category so I understand where you're coming from! Not to fear! There is still more that you can do for me! Mwahaha!</p>
<p>The first thing you can do is share this link on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and your Club Penguin account. You should also follow us on all our social media, @Clickbaittheshow (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter). I know it's an annoying thing to do, but it costs nothing from you and you'd be doing us an enormous favor. The more people who are talking about this, the better, so spread the word! There's a new sheriff in town!</p>
<p>The second thing you can do if you live in or around New York, is to come by and help out! We will always be in need of creative people. Whether you're an actor or director or just want to add a professional credit to your resume and learn a thing or two, we'd be happy to have you! </p>
<p>Lastly, and this probably only applies to a few of you, if you'd like to become an Equity Investor, please contact us separately at TheClickBaitShow@gmail.com. </p>
<p><strong>AND THAT'S EVERYTHING!</strong></p>
<p>Thank you all so much for sticking with me through this essay of a campaign pitch! Please, please, please help in whatever way you can. I know that this is going to be something special, and every dollar helps! </p>
<p>Our campaign will be releasing new photos and videos pretty frequently so do remember to check in and see if we've got any new fun updates for you! We'll be here for 31 days, which goes by faster than you'd think, so don't procrastinate as much as I did with writing all of this!</p>
<p>I can't thank you all enough, so hopefully the show and it's quality will suffice! So keep an eye out, because you won't believe what happens next!</p>

Our campaign will be releasing new photos and videos pretty frequently so do remember to check in and see if we've got any new fun updates for you! We'll be here for 31 days, which goes by faster than you'd think, so don't procrastinate as much as I did with writing all of this!
I can't thank you all enough, so hopefully the show and it's quality will suffice! So keep an eye out, because you won't believe what happens next!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Short Summary
Welcome to our spooky campaign ! Let me introduce ourselves - Paul and I, Magpie, are the two creators of Zombie Oblivion, a short 2D animated musical number about our characters, Sir Mayhem and his assistant, Vee, who accidentally created a horde of zombies.
Paul and I have both been passionate about art our entire lives. I (Magpie) have previously worked on shows such as Hazbin Hotel, Holidaze, Zoophobia and Helluvaboss. I've also directed our first short film, MAYHEM, which was  the pilot introducing our characters.I've learned a lot from the pilot, and am planning on using what I've learned during production to make a new short of even higher quality !
If this campaign succeeds, we'll be able to fund all the hard work that goes into making an animated short film - paying animators, sound designers, music composers and voice actors/singers.
As you can tell by the animated intro used as this campaign's introduction video, we have improved a lot since the pilot episode, especially regarding art consistency, and the Halloween special will be even better ! But if you want to see what we have previously completed in just 5 months of production, here is the MAYHEM pilot short film :

 
Meet the team ! 
Our lovely voice actors for this short are, Kieran Flitton as Sir Mayhem - Black Gryph0n (Gabriel C. Brown) as Sir Mayhem's singing voice - Monica Franco as Vee, Elsie Lovelock as Queen Bee and Wiley Koyote making a bunch of really gross Zombie noises :D

Now, the unpleasent part : what if we DON'T reach our goal ?Well, we're aiming to get the film out on Halloween day, October 31st.I'll make this campaign a flexible funding, so we'll use any funds we'll get - however, if we don't reach our goal, we might not be able to hit the Halloween deadline.

The Impact
This year has been a very difficult one for everyone : most of us have been depressed, scared, got our vacations ruined, were unable to see our friends and loved ones for a ridiculous amount of time. I may not be able to fix that, but I like to believe that people who create entertainment such as animations, comedy videos, etc, help to bring a few smiles to people (this is even true without the current situation this year, too !)I will make sure that this Halloween musical does not disappoint you guys !My last campaign may not have reached its goal, but the project got completed anyway !

Risks & Challenges
The only real risk is that we won't reach the goal of this campaign, and therefore not be able to meet the deadline.However, as our previous project shows, we don't give up easily ! And even if this takes us quite awhile to gather the funds by saving our own money, we will make it happen ! It might just take us a lot longer.

<h2>Hey Loyal Fans!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We are really excited that you have found your way to our Indiegogo campaign! If you support us in this journey, you'll be supporting a really cool lemons/lemonade situation.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p>ComedySportz is the longest-running, game-based, short form improv comedy show in the comedy capital of the world, perfect for all ages, offering comedy for everyone! ComedySportz's interactive format is emceed by a referee overseeing a hilarious battle of wits between the home team, the blue Downtown Chicago Bosses, and the ""visiting"" red team, scored by live keyboard music and rocking popular music between scenes!  Using audience suggestions and willing volunteers, our professional players  create short games, scenes and songs on the spot, and the winner is determined by the Applause-o-Meter and your laughs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>OUR CURRENT SITUATION</h3>
<p>COVID has been especially hard on entertainment venues like our improv theater, ComedySportz. We were among the first to close and we'll be among the last to open. CSz Theater Chicago has pivoted to doing virtual shows on Zoom, but Zoom is definitely not the final destination of virtual comedy. We want to be pioneers taking things to the next step.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE OPPORTUNITY</h3>
<p>We have an intriguing but expensive opportunity to stream our shows on Twitch. We've done some prototyping. We know we can make this work. In order to do this though, we basically have to make ourselves into a TV studio. That mostly means purchasing new computer hardware and software, graphics support and so much more nerd stuff.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>IT'S NOT FOR SURVIVAL, IT'S FOR INNOVATION!</h3>
<p>In case you're wondering, we intend to keep producing content on Twitch long after people are allowed back into theaters. Indeed, we are hoping it becomes a new revenue source for us. So we are not asking for this money for our survival, this ask is for you to support evolution and innovation.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE ACTUAL ASK </h3>
<p>We are asking for a one-time donation of literally any amount to help us purchase the equipment necessary to make the next step. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>RISKS AND CHALLENGES </h3>
<p>Like anyone who is innovating, there is a pretty good chance we will need to revise our expectations along the way, but..... we have received A LOT of coaching and education along the way so far! We have done some prototyping (which showed us that we need more powerful equipment to run it!) and have learned some of the do's and don'ts with streaming, landing on the tWitch platform, which gives us the most opportunity for audience interaction and best case scenario, this will turn into a juicy new revenue stream for us.</p>

COVID has been especially hard on entertainment venues like our improv theater, ComedySportz. We were among the first to close and we'll be among the last to open. CSz Theater Chicago has pivoted to doing virtual shows on Zoom, but Zoom is definitely not the final destination of virtual comedy. We want to be pioneers taking things to the next step.
 
THE OPPORTUNITY
We have an intriguing but expensive opportunity to stream our shows on Twitch. We've done some prototyping. We know we can make this work. In order to do this though, we basically have to make ourselves into a TV studio. That mostly means purchasing new computer hardware and software, graphics support and so much more nerd stuff.
 
IT'S NOT FOR SURVIVAL, IT'S FOR INNOVATION!
In case you're wondering, we intend to keep producing content on Twitch long after people are allowed back into theaters. Indeed, we are hoping it becomes a new revenue source for us. So we are not asking for this money for our survival, this ask is for you to support evolution and innovation.
 
THE ACTUAL ASK 
We are asking for a one-time donation of literally any amount to help us purchase the equipment necessary to make the next step. 
 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES 
Like anyone who is innovating, there is a pretty good chance we will need to revise our expectations along the way, but..... we have received A LOT of coaching and education along the way so far! We have done some prototyping (which showed us that we need more powerful equipment to run it!) and have learned some of the do's and don'ts with streaming, landing on the tWitch platform, which gives us the most opportunity for audience interaction and best case scenario, this will turn into a juicy new revenue stream for us.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>We're three sketch comedy friends that met at The Pack Theater in Hollywood, CA.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We did the math (HARD) of what it would take to get this pilot going, and we need funds for our director, AD, makeup, sound, craft services, location fees, etc.  We want to do this right, and even if we meet our goal, we expect to fund a decent amount of this ourselves.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It's hard to produce a pilot!  Heck, it's hard to put together one good video sketch, we're looking to shoot at LEAST 8.  We already have half of them scheduled out, and the other half all take place in unique locations so it will take scouting, location fees, and we may not have the ability to combine sketches on certain days (which saves money).</p>

<p>If you can't contribute yourself (we get it!) - you'd be doing us a great service by simply sharing it and encouraging your friends to share it.  Seriously, please do this if you are reading this sentence with your eyeballs.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>SETTLING is a 6 x 5 minute comedy web series about a girl who wants to propose in 2017. The fight for gay marriage is still raging on, 70% of millennials still list marriage as a goal, and we've all seen <i>those</i> engagement pictures plastered on social media (apparently everyone loses their sense of irony once they've bought a diamond). Yet a surprising number of people still respond to the idea of a <i>woman</i> proposing to a <i>man</i> with questions like: ‘Is it a leap year?’ or, ‘The bastard, how long has he made you wait?’ This series asks what marriage means to us today, from a contemporary, female perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Mattie</strong> is in love with <strong>Leo</strong>, but they still live in a flatshare, get paid minimum wage and hang out with a group of friends who use apps called Threender. Each bite-sized episode follows Mattie as she tackles doubts and questions from her friends, her boss, her parents, strangers and even her ex-boyfriend, before finally deciding whether to pop the question. Proposing as a girl has never been easy, but why is it <i>still</i> so hard?</p>
<p>We are a young team, with collective past experience of working in production on big-budget movies, self-making other comedy web series and writing and acting in comedy for TV and stage. Now we want to bring together our skills to tell a story we haven't seen told before, in a tone that we don't feel we hear enough on the UK comedy scene. Naturalistic, ironic, contemporary, but also warm, and centred on the female experience; we have been inspired by series like Transparent, Girls, Easy, Master of None, Catastrophe and Him &amp; Her.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are creating this off our own backs, by and large using locations, actors and crew who are kind and passionate enough to give up their time, to make something truly collaborative. This is about  taking some agency and making something of our own, which we can be proud of, rather than waiting for it to be handed to us.</p>
<p>So what we need is enough money to provide our actors with food and travel, pay for the pieces of kit that our production team don’t have, buy some specialist props and cover the cost of the less accessible locations. We are not asking you for anything that we don’t absolutely need, because we are willing to put everything we have into this ourselves. So, in the same spirit of collaboration, you can truly feel that you have given what you can – nothing more and (ideally) nothing less!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Creative Team</h3>
<p><strong>RUBY THOMAS </strong>(writer/director/actor) - Ruby Thomas has acted in film, theatre and television, including the BBC comedy FAIL, BLANDINGS, AGATHA RAISIN, ENDEAVOUR, WILD CHILD and SPRING AWAKENING. She completed the Soho Writers Lab in 2016/17 and is on commission at Soho Theatre working on her comedy-drama EITHER, about monogamy and the paradox of choice. As a writer-performer she created comedy show CHICK for the Edinburgh Festival, which transferred to Soho Rising. She felt inspired to write this web series after proposing to her partner last year. The number of people who said, 'wow, <i>you</i> proposed to <i>him</i>, that's amazing!!' made her think about how proposing is one of the last bastions of gendered 'tradition' we seem reluctant, as a culture, to dismantle. And what better way to dismantle it than comedy? This will be her screen directing debut.</p>
<p><strong>NEURON PRODUCTIONS </strong>(DOPs) - Sami and Hunter have been making films together for almost 15 years. They started out on their bedroom floors and founded NEURON two years ago. Since then, they’ve made a whole heap of videos - from comedy series, to music videos, to documentaries, and beyond. Comic Relief commissioned them to make the summer anthem SUMMER’S GONNA LAST FOREVER, and they’re finishing off work on the comedy web series NOT ALL MEN at the moment. They’ve made music videos for artists like Maz O’Connor and have created a documentary series about student life for CAMPUS SOCIETY. They’ve also been commissioned to produce videos for the NHS as well as businesses such as LEON and BAIN AND COMPANY. On top of all that, they’ve even filmed a wedding or two in their time - but this will be their first proposal.</p>
<p><strong>VIVIEN KENNY</strong> (producer)- Vivien graduated from Falmouth University with a degree in Film in 2014. One of Vivien's graduate films STYLE BROKERS (Cairns, 2014),  a short documentary about the fashion brand Duffer Of St George, went on to compete in festivals such as Aesthetica Film Festival and BFI Future Film Fest. Once Vivien moved back to London in 2014 she joined DNA Films &amp; TV as the in house production assistant, she then moved onto one of their productions as a production assistant and she now works at Heyday Films as an assistant to Producer David Heyman. Her feature film credits include THIRD STAR (Dalton, 2010), FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD (Vinterberg, 2015), ANNIHILATION (Garland, 2018), PADDINGTON 2 (King, 2017) and the unnamed sequel to FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM (Yates, 2018). </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Cast</h3>
<p>Our most persuasive feature is surely our utterly brilliant cast. From sitcoms to franchise movies to the West End stage, these actors have seen more trailers than a campsite. Yet every single one of them has agreed to perform in this for free, simply for the joy of it. Please, for the love of god, help us pay for their breakfasts.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As everyone knows, funding is hard to come by as a producer; interesting roles are hard to come by as an actor; and pretty much everything is hard to come by as a writer. So we wanted to do this ourselves, to show what we are capable as creatives, and to make something genuinely funny and real for an online audience. The series will be available to view on Vimeo and there will be a launch party and a screening for the public too.</p>
<p>We want this series to be a calling card for everyone involved, and we will use it to pitch to production companies and commissioners, in the hope of making SETTLING into something bigger: a full length series, or at the very least a second mini-series (bring on the wedding!), which you won’t have to pay for.</p>
<p>This is all about giving a platform to an utterly brilliant cast, in the funny, naturalistic, diverse roles that we don’t see often enough on TV.</p>

<h3>What This Project Is:</h3>
<p>These are stories of four expats, who live and work in Kyiv. They admire the architecture, the food, the music, the people, the history, the parks, the hilly streets, the secret bars, the whimsical statues, the gorgeous murals. They call Kyiv home and will let you see it through their eyes. There are four video chapters – each under 2-minutes, narrated in English by our characters – a journalist, an NGO worker, an IT specialist, and an artist.</p>
<h3>Why This Is Important:</h3>
<p>We have embarked on this journey to fix the unfortunate reality that, unlike New York, Paris, Berlin or Moscow, which all have been featured in multiple movies, music videos and commercials, Kyiv remains largely visually unknown to wide audiences abroad. Sadly, it hasn’t even gotten a decent video promo for the Eurovision 2017 song contest. We want to fix this injustice. We want to show that Kyiv is cinematic in its greenery and serenity, in its energy and movement, in its old and new facades and in the interesting characters inhabiting it, foreign and local. </p>
<p>This will be the first project of its kind in English - personal accounts of four expats, who work in different industries in Ukraine's capital and who know and love Kyiv. For them, it's a city that inspires them, they see huge potential in it and want to tell you why Ukraine's capital is a special place!</p>
<h3>Why You May Be Interested in Supporting Us:</h3>
<p>If you have visited Kyiv before and have a special relationship with it in your heart, please help us express the love we share for this city. If you are someone who’s intrigued by what Kyiv is like, but have never visited, please help us create something that will allow you and others to experience Ukraine’s capital through our stories. </p>
<p>If you live in Kyiv and are proud of our city, please help us show that Kyiv is Europe's best kept secret! </p>
<h3>Who We Are:</h3>
<p>Elena Serdyuk is the author of the idea and director of the chapters. Elena works in film and commercial production in New York as a script supervisor and has worked as a journalist and video producer in Kyiv. Her love for Kyiv inspired her to seek out the like-minded foreigners, living in the city, and the project began to take shape. </p>
<p>Olya Chernykh is the director of photography and producer. Olya has worked at one of Ukraine’s most successful production companies Toy Pictures as a producer, before moving onto working on independent projects. She has a full understanding of the production process and is passionate about her work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help: </h3>
<p>With this campaign we are looking to cover our production and post-production costs. This is not in any way a money-making project for us - we believe in the potential of this series for spreading awareness about Ukraine's capital among people from other countries and cultures. </p>
<p>We aim to produce commercial-quality stories on a shoe-string budget. An average rate for a 60-second TV commercial spot, shot in Kyiv these days is around $30,000, and we are trying to carry out a project that we feel strongly about for a small fraction of that. Our goal is $1,500 for each of the four chapters.</p>
<p>The funds we raise will allow us to pay for equipment rental, transportation, food for the crew, and post-production work. Everyone on the production team is enthusiastic about this project and agreed to rates much lower than normal, because we really want to show you Kyiv for what we all love it.</p>
<p>We hope to reach our monetary goal, but if we don't right away, we will still focus on the production of at least one or two chapters and then continue fundraising. We are serious and passionate about this. </p>
<h3>Challenges We Face:</h3>
<p>We realize that this is an ambitious project, involving many moving parts - coordinating the schedules of our characters, arranging locations, some of which we have to pay for, requesting that our crew members work for less than they usually charge. Nonetheless, we feel strongly about embarking on this journey and hope you will support us along the way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute yourself, please share this campaign with friends and family. Any contribution, however small, will help us tell these Kyiv stories and share them with the world!</p>
<p>From Kyiv with love.</p>

Elena Serdyuk is the author of the idea and director of the chapters. Elena works in film and commercial production in New York as a script supervisor and has worked as a journalist and video producer in Kyiv. Her love for Kyiv inspired her to seek out the like-minded foreigners, living in the city, and the project began to take shape. 
Olya Chernykh is the director of photography and producer. Olya has worked at one of Ukraine’s most successful production companies Toy Pictures as a producer, before moving onto working on independent projects. She has a full understanding of the production process and is passionate about her work.

Why We Need Your Help: 
With this campaign we are looking to cover our production and post-production costs. This is not in any way a money-making project for us - we believe in the potential of this series for spreading awareness about Ukraine's capital among people from other countries and cultures. 
We aim to produce commercial-quality stories on a shoe-string budget. An average rate for a 60-second TV commercial spot, shot in Kyiv these days is around $30,000, and we are trying to carry out a project that we feel strongly about for a small fraction of that. Our goal is $1,500 for each of the four chapters.
The funds we raise will allow us to pay for equipment rental, transportation, food for the crew, and post-production work. Everyone on the production team is enthusiastic about this project and agreed to rates much lower than normal, because we really want to show you Kyiv for what we all love it.
We hope to reach our monetary goal, but if we don't right away, we will still focus on the production of at least one or two chapters and then continue fundraising. We are serious and passionate about this. 
Challenges We Face:
We realize that this is an ambitious project, involving many moving parts - coordinating the schedules of our characters, arranging locations, some of which we have to pay for, requesting that our crew members work for less than they usually charge. Nonetheless, we feel strongly about embarking on this journey and hope you will support us along the way.

Other Ways You Can Help:
If you can't contribute yourself, please share this campaign with friends and family. Any contribution, however small, will help us tell these Kyiv stories and share them with the world!

<h3><strong>The Plot</strong></h3>
<p>THE CANDY STORE is the world's first mainstream TV series centered around crossdressing and gender non-conforming lifestyles. </p>
<p>The series follows The Lacey Family, owners of a medical prosthetics shop that inadvertently becomes a shopping hub for crossdressers, trans women, and female led couples.  Now, in order to be successful, the Lacey's must understand the desires and risks of their clients, all while managing the secrets of the seemingly vanilla community. </p>
<p><strong>The characters will be from all walks of life as this topic is universal and ageless.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About the creators</strong></h3>
<p>The show is being created by a very unique pair.  MINDY is an actress and also the co- owner of a boutique that caters to crossdressers.  MICHAEL is a professional screenwriter that enjoys crossdressing.  One day Michael walked into Mindy's shop and - BAM! - a show was born. </p>
<p>We each have our own reasons why we crossdress.  And we've seen crossdressing portrayed as a goof in film and tv time and time again.  We can all agree that...</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>No film or TV series has ever gotten it right. </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Our goal</strong></h3>
<p>This is a major TV series, staffed by Emmy Award-winning industry professionals that will feature an A-List or former A-List star and be presented to Netflix and Amazon Prime for worldwide distribution.  The only way to help society to understand and accept us is through maximum exposure in the mainstream. </p>
<p>Our ultimate budget goal is $600,000.  This will enable us to produce the full, six episode first season.  We are seeking to raise a little bit more than half of that - $350,000 - through indiegogo.  The rest will be raised through private investments. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Most crossdressers are in the closet.</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Imagine a series as big as BREAKING BAD, BIG LITTLE LIES or THE SOPRANOS that helps everyone understand that crossdressing is not something to hide or be ashamed of.  Whether undergoing gender reassignment, living full time as a female, expressing a femme side occasionally, or simply being in a female led relationship - our diverse interests need to be represented in pop culture and met with the same acceptance as all other forms of diversity. <strong> WE ALL NEED  TO BE COMFORTABLE AND HAPPY IN OUR OWN SKIN</strong>. This is mission of THE CANDY STORE.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Our Award-Winning Production Team</strong></h3>
<p>Because some of our team members have not yet come out publicly as crossdressers, we won't be listing their names until the show is complete.  However, THE CANDY STORE'S current crew has combined for 5 Emmy Awards, won top film festivals in NY and LA, and has been involved with major productions featuring stars such as JENNIFER ANISTON, DAVID SCHWIMMER, BRUCE WILLIS, HUGH GRANT AND SIR RICHARD ATTENBOROUGH.</p>
<p>The finished product will be of top quality in terms of camera, lenses, lighting, and talent. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Biggest Challenge</strong></h3>
<p>We are aware that there are people out there that may not want to watch 'a crossdressing show'.  But our experienced production team knows this and this is how we plan to mitigate this factor:</p>
<p>Did people watch BREAKING BAD because they were interested in Meth?  Did they watch ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK because they were interested in prison?  In both cases, audiences found the characters interesting and decided to go with them on a journey - wherever it went.  We plan to do the same.  Audiences will fall in love with the Lacey Family and want to see them succeed.  The lessons we plan to teach will be carefully placed in increments that the public can digest as we help educate the world.  <strong>CROSSDRESSING IS ALL AROUND US...WE JUST DON'T SEE IT!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Even though it's called a 'donation', you still get something for your money!  We have a really awesome list of rewards that come with each donation amount.  Please take a look at the rewards on the right because if you're looking to indulge your femme side, there just might be something worth checking out!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Production companies are interested in producing THE CANDY STORE, but if we accept their offers, they'll want to bring their team on board and we fear they won't understand the delicate nature of our individual stories.  That is why we want this show to be written and produced by people in our community - from the writers, to the crew, to those making contributions.  We want to keep it in the family!</p>
<p>We have everything in place.  All we need is the funding. </p>
<p>Please make a contribution and share this link with anyone that you think would benefit from a show like this.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Discretion</strong></h3>
<p>We understand the importance of discretion, as many of us are closeted.  Please don't let that prevent you from being a part of our team.  Donations will appear on a credit card statement as: ""CANDY STORE""  There will be nothing connecting you to the title or content of the show.  </p>

<h3><strong>Exposure</strong></h3>
<p>If you'd like the world to see your femme pics, you can email us your photo after making a donation and refer to our list of rewards for potential exposure. </p>

<h3>THE FAE series</h3>
<p>BACKGROUND: FORMERLY FAEMILY STYLE</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573161399/lhh4wz3jmpjtf2lxytc6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Last year, with the invaluable help of our supporters, we raised $4,000 to develop a queerly fantastical web series. Over the past year, we've been hard at work, drafting and revising scripts, plotting season arcs, organizing readings, building community interest, growing financial support, and assembling a formidable creative team. Originally conceived as a variety show called <i>Faemily Style</i>, the project has evolved into a high-concept fantasy dramedy: <strong><i>The Fae</i></strong>. This fall, working with our amazing community, we filmed the first two episodes of this exciting new series!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574370428/sghpqkaaxujbbi8ilyez.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS for THE FAE</strong></p>
<p>Mixing trenchant realism with surrealist fantasy, <strong><i>The Fae</i></strong> celebrates queer flamboyance as a magical force to be reckoned with. Think <i>The Outs</i> meets <i>Buffy </i>and <i><i>Harry Potter</i></i> by way of <i>Pink Narcissus</i>. The series follows Mark (Shelton Lindsay), a gay millennial who possesses all the trappings coveted by mainstream gay culture, who suddenly learns of magically queer beings called faeries – and that he might be one of them!</p>
<p>The first season of <strong><i>The Fae</i></strong> explores Mark’s awkward first steps as he struggles to learn how to harness his faerie flamboyance in his everyday life. Just how much will Mark have to sacrifice to learn the true nature of his magical power?</p>

</div></div>","THE FAE series
BACKGROUND: FORMERLY FAEMILY STYLE

Last year, with the invaluable help of our supporters, we raised $4,000 to develop a queerly fantastical web series. Over the past year, we've been hard at work, drafting and revising scripts, plotting season arcs, organizing readings, building community interest, growing financial support, and assembling a formidable creative team. Originally conceived as a variety show called Faemily Style, the project has evolved into a high-concept fantasy dramedy: The Fae. This fall, working with our amazing community, we filmed the first two episodes of this exciting new series!

SYNOPSIS for THE FAE
Mixing trenchant realism with surrealist fantasy, The Fae celebrates queer flamboyance as a magical force to be reckoned with. Think The Outs meets Buffy and Harry Potter by way of Pink Narcissus. The series follows Mark (Shelton Lindsay), a gay millennial who possesses all the trappings coveted by mainstream gay culture, who suddenly learns of magically queer beings called faeries – and that he might be one of them!
The first season of The Fae explores Mark’s awkward first steps as he struggles to learn how to harness his faerie flamboyance in his everyday life. Just how much will Mark have to sacrifice to learn the true nature of his magical power?

TALENT for THE FAE
CREATORS: 
Shelton Lindsay (Creator, Writer, Show Runner, Production Designer): As designer and performer, Shelton has faeried up music videos, commercial shoots, professional film sets and T.V. (Catch him in Seasons 1, 2 of High Maintenance, Tales of the City and in Amy Miller Gross’ Accommodations).
Justin Taylor (Creator, Writer): Justin is a playwright and TV writer who has brought his fae spirit to numerous theatrical productions and TV pilots (including his musical Alien Love Child and work at Playwright’s Horizons, BRIC Arts Media, and Prospect Theater; MFA from Yale).
Joshua Fesi (Creator, Writer): Joshua is a playwright (Paradise Lost in Space) and visual artist, has a Ph.D. in English, and has been a mainstay in the Radical Faerie performance world.

<h3>the STORY</h3>
<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I'm Damon Faulkner, a screenwriter, director, and producer. Marvine High is the largest project I have worked on, and it is near to my heart because I wrote the story. The story came to me while I was sitting on the subway. This idea of a stolen test sparked into a web series now called Marvine High.</p>
<p>The story of Marvine High follows high school senior Jackie Carlton through her rigorous investigation into who stole the graduation test. Things become tricky when four of the school's star students are accused of the crime. Jackie and her close friend Maxine have to decipher who is lying, who is telling the truth, and who is guilty.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>the BREAKDOWN</h3>
<p><strong>Our goal is $5,000!</strong> That being said, not a penny will be wasted. Our team has worked tirelessly to form a budget that is attainable and practical. We want to share our budget with you so that you know precisely where your money is going!</p>
<p>None of the money is going toward myself, the creator, or any of the producers or directors. This project means much more to us than a profit. </p>
<p><strong>Location: $2,500</strong> (Our location is a key part of this project and consumes the majority of our budget)</p>
<p><strong>Transportation: $250</strong> (Getting our cast and crew to and from location)</p>
<p><strong>Craft Services: $500 </strong>(Because we aren't paying our actors we want to make sure we are properly feeding them!)</p>
<p><strong>Art Department: $550 </strong>(Achieving that 90s feel will take a skilled art team and supplies)</p>
<p><strong>Music Rights: $400</strong> (One of our characters is a musical star and we need the rights to her song for her storyline to make sense!)</p>
<p><strong>Festival Fees: $300</strong> (To be able to send our work to festivals around the United States!)</p>
<p><strong>Promotional Items: $200</strong> (Things like posters, stickers and t-shirts)</p>

<h3>the WHY</h3>
<p>Marvine High is a great project to donate to for many reasons. </p>
<ul>
<li>We are excited to be working with a local high school. The school is a vocational high school with students of many different backgrounds and interests. We are getting their students involved with hands-on experience in costuming, makeup and on set experience.</li>
<li>We are giving Temple University students hands-on experience as well, as most of our team members are currently in school themselves. </li>
<li>This is the first project I have produced at this scale. I have produced a few short films outside of my academic career, with each I learned something new that I intend to bring to Marvine High!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>the CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>Transparency is one of our team's greatest values. We aim to be open and honest with our supporters about the risks and obstacles we may face on the way to achieving our goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>With a project lasting 3 months of shooting, there are always risks, but what is art without a little risk?</li>
<li>Our team is dedicated and passionate about this project. The opportunity for error would most likely arise with timing, as we have allotted five weekends to film with no available dates for reshoots. However, that being said, our team is working tirelessly to make sure our planning is flawless. </li>
<li>Actors are another worry for our team. We are looking for actors that have a connection with the characters and people that committed to their work, which could pose a challenge since these are unpaid positions. </li>
