<h1>What is this Documentary about?</h1>
<p>eCommerce: The Rise of the Internet Entrepreneur is an in depth look at how the world of commerce has changed because of the internet. We will be presenting the history of this ""Wild Wild West"" of commerce as well as interviewing working entrepreneurs who are dedicated to surviving and thriving in business online.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the topics we will be covering in this documentary:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did the Internet pave the way for new business?</li>
<li>What opportunities lie in wait for the brave entrepreneur?</li>
<li>What pitfalls and struggles loom in this world?</li>
<li>How you can get started?</li>
<li>Who really calls the shots (Google, Amazon, Ebay, etc.)</li>
<li>How does this change your life as opposed to a 9-5 Job?</li>
<li>How does it effect the family?</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Will This Documentary Film Be Presented?</h2>
<p>This incredible world will be brought to light at a professional level using the following techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Animated Segments</b> - breaking down complex theories in understandable tidbits.</li>
<li>
<b>In Office Interviews</b> - and conversations with Internet Entrepreneur's in Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Our team consists of several amazingly talented filmmakers</b> - who will be traveling to document the stories of these amazing people, including <b> an incredibly talented animator</b> who will be help bring the informational pieces of our documentary to life in an entertaining and beautiful way.</p>
<h1>What Makes Us Suited To Tell This Story?</h1>
<p>My name is <b>Phil Hudson</b> and I have held almost every job imaginable in the world of Internet Marketing. Those jobs included fielding phone calls, selling Internet Marketing packages, managing fulfillment and support for those clients as an account manager (Fortune 500 companies as well as small local businesses), owning and operating ecommerce websites, working as an in-house internet marketing director, speaking at conferences in Las Vegas in front of hundreds of Real Estate brokers, and running an Internet Marketing agency.</p>
<p>The Kicker:<b>I come from a family of 5 kids, divorced parents, and a life of poverty,</b> I'm technically a college dropout, &amp; I don't know how to code or program. Why does that matter? Because that means <b>ANYONE can change their life with an online business</b>, if you know how and what to do. I want to show the world exactly that.</p>
<p>The point is, for the last five years I have ate, slept, drank, and breathed Internet Marketing. It fascinates me still and consumes my thoughts, dictating the very way I analyze everything in life. It has provided a living for me far greater than I could have ever imagined.</p>
<p>Now, stepping back from that world to pursue a career in filmmaking (my first true love), it dawned on me that so few people know about this hidden opportunity lying just under the surface of our every day interactions with the internet. <b>I NEED to tell this story</b> and <b>I have some amazing people I am able to interview and document to provide real world examples of success in online business.</b></p>
<p><b>I want to educate people just like you.</b></p>
<h2>How Will YOUR Funds be Spent</h2>
<p>We need roughly $3000 to make this documentary. We are leveraging favors with families and friends in most of the areas we are traveling to in order to make this as cheap as possible while providing a professional look and feel. Here is where those funds are going:</p>

What is this Documentary about?
eCommerce: The Rise of the Internet Entrepreneur is an in depth look at how the world of commerce has changed because of the internet. We will be presenting the history of this ""Wild Wild West"" of commerce as well as interviewing working entrepreneurs who are dedicated to surviving and thriving in business online.
Here are a few of the topics we will be covering in this documentary:

How did the Internet pave the way for new business?
What opportunities lie in wait for the brave entrepreneur?
What pitfalls and struggles loom in this world?
How you can get started?
Who really calls the shots (Google, Amazon, Ebay, etc.)
How does this change your life as opposed to a 9-5 Job?
How does it effect the family?

How Will This Documentary Film Be Presented?
This incredible world will be brought to light at a professional level using the following techniques:


Animated Segments - breaking down complex theories in understandable tidbits.

In Office Interviews - and conversations with Internet Entrepreneur's in Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles.

Our team consists of several amazingly talented filmmakers - who will be traveling to document the stories of these amazing people, including  an incredibly talented animator who will be help bring the informational pieces of our documentary to life in an entertaining and beautiful way.
What Makes Us Suited To Tell This Story?
My name is Phil Hudson and I have held almost every job imaginable in the world of Internet Marketing. Those jobs included fielding phone calls, selling Internet Marketing packages, managing fulfillment and support for those clients as an account manager (Fortune 500 companies as well as small local businesses), owning and operating ecommerce websites, working as an in-house internet marketing director, speaking at conferences in Las Vegas in front of hundreds of Real Estate brokers, and running an Internet Marketing agency.
The Kicker:I come from a family of 5 kids, divorced parents, and a life of poverty, I'm technically a college dropout, & I don't know how to code or program. Why does that matter? Because that means ANYONE can change their life with an online business, if you know how and what to do. I want to show the world exactly that.
The point is, for the last five years I have ate, slept, drank, and breathed Internet Marketing. It fascinates me still and consumes my thoughts, dictating the very way I analyze everything in life. It has provided a living for me far greater than I could have ever imagined.
Now, stepping back from that world to pursue a career in filmmaking (my first true love), it dawned on me that so few people know about this hidden opportunity lying just under the surface of our every day interactions with the internet. I NEED to tell this story and I have some amazing people I am able to interview and document to provide real world examples of success in online business.
I want to educate people just like you.
How Will YOUR Funds be Spent
We need roughly $3000 to make this documentary. We are leveraging favors with families and friends in most of the areas we are traveling to in order to make this as cheap as possible while providing a professional look and feel. Here is where those funds are going:


Animation - We have an incredible animator who is going to do some incredible work bringing the educational parts of this documentary to life. This is the most important technical piece of our documentary at this point. We have professional cameras and sound equipment for the interview portions of our documentary, but we need the animations to ensure we have it right.

Post Production - Along with the animation, we need to do some post production. Color correction,


Music Scoring & Composition - We don't want to use stock music or anything common, so we are working with a team of composers to come up with a solid score for this film.

Travel Expenses - We are going to be in San Diego, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Utah. We need to get there and eat, but we are cutting costs as much as possible.

Ebooks - Written and prepared by a professional SEO company.

<h3><strong>WHAT </strong></h3>
<p>In <i>Love Interdicted</i>, a universe - both inner and outer - centred on prostitution is revealed through a story.</p>
<p>Contrary to a current affairs or documentary-like approach, <i>Love Interdicted</i>´s glimpse at a certain milieu and way of life is openly subjective, partial and subordinated to a dramatic (or tragic) storyline, which is at least as important in the film as the milieu portrayed. The milieu-portrait part emerges as an impromptu, deranged, flash journey that no viewer will forget.</p>
<p>That said, <i>Love Interdicted</i> is entirely based on real experiences and long conversations, as well as on written exchanges over the years. <i>Love Interdicted</i> is terribly true.</p>
<p>Love Interdicted aims to challenge viewers’ preconceived ideas and stereotypes of a certain type of sex work, as well as inviting them to visit unexplored worlds. In fact, stereotypes and limited points of view are most current, even in some of the most remarkable examples of literary or film works portraying the world of prostitution and its inhabitants.</p>
<p>The project draws its energy from discontent, a will to offer new points of view, shake our fragile certainties and be truthful. It draws its strength from a long period of maturation and confidence developed with real people from the <i>milieu</i>. And draws inspiration from many sources and references, where Hölderlin, Quignard, Laure (George Bataille’s tragic love), Sylvia Plath or Joyce are likely to be more relevant than Sade, Maupassant or the painters of <i>maisons closes</i> and <i>filles de joie</i>.</p>
<p>Behind <i>Love Interdicted</i>, its characters, plots and settings, there are people. Women. Most of them will never know that they contributed to and shaped my desire to paint a certain picture of human existence via an image of a strange, maybe self-revealing, often self-destructive way of life, a perilous job, like poetry.</p>
<p>Thus <i>Love Interdicted</i> has a meaning and impact that far exceeds a film or an ephemeral series. It also concerns the dignity of all those who, behind the scenes, nourished this project and shared so much, beyond good and evil, beyond beautiful and ugly. That is why your contribution means so much.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT FOR</strong></h3>
<p><i>Love Interdicted</i> is a multi-outcome film writing and production project, based on years of research and exchanges.</p>
<p>This fundraising campaign supports a specific stage of the project’s life cycle, expected to last 6-8 months (depending on the level of funding obtained) and delivering:</p>
<ul>
<li>An advanced writing and IP development process leading to a pre-production package (concept, final treatment, draft screenplay, approach, financing and production strategy) for a long form work. The final decision on the most appropriate format of this work (i.e., feature film or limited-run series) will be based on development itself.</li>
<li>A short film that will serve as a test, a partial proof of concept for what comes next and the first visible output for all those who support the project;</li>
<li>Possibly, spin-offs, some exclusively for supporters, depending on the level of funding obtained.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next stage (expected 2021) is the last, pre-production development phase. Additional funding sources and partners will join at this point, which includes the preparation of a pre-production version of a bible/screenplay, a pilot, teasers and finalizing the business/financing strategy for production/co-production.</p>

<p>I’ll be coordinating the writing and development process, with a small, talented group (writing and production) and the short film to be produced during stage 2 will be created and co-directed by this core team.

<p>We will update you on the Team as this campaign develops.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Overfunding/underfunding</strong></p>
<p>This a very spartan budget, and overfunding is very unlikely to happen, except if crowdfunding and other revenue grow beyond our expectations. Should overfunding occur, we put more production value into the short film and/or pursue screenwriting/development work beyond the foreseen 6-month period and/or with a larger team.</p>
<p>Underfunding may occur, particularly if the outcome of the crowodfunding campaign does not meet our goal. In that case, we will try to increase revenue from partnerships/sponsoring or equity and, if necessary, reduce the (6-month) screenwriting/development period and/or reduce production costs of the short film. In such an event, we will inform our backers about our options and their implications.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT WE OFFER</strong></h3>
<p>Love Interdicted is neither a sequel, comics-based action film, nor a sensationalist TV documentary. We need sensitive, visionary people who can realize its originality, strength and potential at this early stage. </p>
<p>We truly believe in the importance of the “community” dimension of crowdfunding. We want to offer you the chance to really engage and participate in a project from an early stage, to share with us the experience of film creation, film funding and film production.</p>
<p>Therefore, our perks policy offers opportunities for combining entertainment and the satisfaction of supporting a project with other benefits, such as “soft” training/learning, different levels of interaction and a de facto first access to future investment perspectives resulting from this development stage. </p>

<h3><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></h3>
<p>Perhaps you would like to support the project, but you can't afford to contribute. This doesn't mean you can't help. You can actively support us by sharing our campaign with potentially interested people.</p>
<p>Indiegogo provides a “referrals” system, and we intend to use it to reward our non-financial supporters, our messengers, by offering them perks equivalent to the contributions we get from people you referrered us to. This means possible free upgrades of your rewards! Example: you contribute with 180€ (Full Exp pack) and share our page; people you refer us to contribute a total of 1400€; YOUR reward is consequently upgraded from Full Exp to PATRON (worth 1200€)!</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: The Indiegogo referrals tracking system applies only when you share using the Indiegogo share tools in this campaign page! (top right, under number of backers).</p>
<p>We need all of you!</p>

Underfunding may occur, particularly if the outcome of the crowodfunding campaign does not meet our goal. In that case, we will try to increase revenue from partnerships/sponsoring or equity and, if necessary, reduce the (6-month) screenwriting/development period and/or reduce production costs of the short film. In such an event, we will inform our backers about our options and their implications.
 
WHAT WE OFFER
Love Interdicted is neither a sequel, comics-based action film, nor a sensationalist TV documentary. We need sensitive, visionary people who can realize its originality, strength and potential at this early stage. 
We truly believe in the importance of the “community” dimension of crowdfunding. We want to offer you the chance to really engage and participate in a project from an early stage, to share with us the experience of film creation, film funding and film production.
Therefore, our perks policy offers opportunities for combining entertainment and the satisfaction of supporting a project with other benefits, such as “soft” training/learning, different levels of interaction and a de facto first access to future investment perspectives resulting from this development stage.

OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
Perhaps you would like to support the project, but you can't afford to contribute. This doesn't mean you can't help. You can actively support us by sharing our campaign with potentially interested people.
Indiegogo provides a “referrals” system, and we intend to use it to reward our non-financial supporters, our messengers, by offering them perks equivalent to the contributions we get from people you referrered us to. This means possible free upgrades of your rewards! Example: you contribute with 180€ (Full Exp pack) and share our page; people you refer us to contribute a total of 1400€; YOUR reward is consequently upgraded from Full Exp to PATRON (worth 1200€)!
IMPORTANT: The Indiegogo referrals tracking system applies only when you share using the Indiegogo share tools in this campaign page! (top right, under number of backers).
We need all of you!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

I want to carry out a campaign in the schools to change the mind set of teachers, students and the school authorities toward throwing out the pregnant girls out of school. I want to carry out rehabilitation for girls who are sexually abused, victims of domestic violence and they are teenage mothers.

When Andy's only friend, a night-shift nurse, is slain by the maniac guard, he turns to Leon, a large, gentle giant for help. Together they set out to put a stop to the violence but Leon has his own reasons for being in the asylum and these reasons are just as bloody!   </p>

<h3>Getting Unstuck</h3>
<p>In January 2016 two daring South African women - Ronet &amp; Jeanne - decided to sell most of their belongings in search of adventure, needing to escape a comfort zone that kept them from reaching and living their full potential.</p>
<p>The goal was to travel through as many of the 48 contiguous United States as possible within a 5 month period, with a camper van of some sort.</p>
<p>They managed to leave South Africa on August 30th 2016 en route to America. In Michigan (basecamp) they bought a van and finally got on the road on September 11th 2016.</p>
<p>Being filmmakers they naturally filmed their journey as they went along. Enchanted by the vastness and beauty, the legends and the mystery of American roads, the documenting of their trip quickly turned into a well rounded travel documentary. What they did not expect is how much their Van had a personality of her own. She turned into a third character in the film - more like the leading lady.</p>
<p>They named her Jessie after the ""whodunnit"" enigma Jessica Fletcher, from ""Murder She Wrote"".</p>

<h3>Jessie</h3>
<p>Jessie was born in 1983, the handiwork of Henry Ford. She is pretty solid for a 34 year old van but bought with 77,500 miles on the clock she was bound to need a few fixes. She broke down twice and needed a few initial repairs but managed to drive her 2 allies all the way through the 48 contiguous states. </p>
<p>Jessie is a wise old one, the crew covered a whopping 17,134 miles (27,574 km) but nothing compared to Jessie's 95,000 odd miles. She knows the US road network like very few creatures on earth does. With 34 years of travel behind her she is a seasoned traveller that can tell you things about these roads that very few can.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Roads</h3>
<p>At 4.2 million miles, the road network in the USA is the largest in the world connecting 323 million people. When seen from the air the roads can make one think of the veins in a human body and the people that use it is the blood. Blood gushing through veins every day pulsing with endless possibility. Every day these roads play an integral part in every American's life. It takes on many duties and personalities, it becomes whatever we need it to be. Roads are the purveyors of food and beverage. It takes us away and brings us back home. Keeps us from danger or brings danger to us, saves lives and takes away life. It's used to commit crime and to fight it. It leads to the wonders of billions of years ago and to the possibility of travelling the universe in the future. It holds legends and mysteries that defy what we thought we knew.</p>

The first of many indie films I intend to produce.</p>

<h3>Jeanne Marethe Prinsloo</h3>
<p>I have been in the film industry for the past 12 years in all phases of production. I have fulfilled various roles from production co-ordinator, accountant and post producer in South Africa and abroad in Qatar. I'm very proud and humbled to be part of the team behind ""Jessie, a little van in a very big country"" where I could share my production skills and my passion for documentaries and photography.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Style</strong></h3>
<p>The film will have 2 treatments with 2 distinct voices:</p>
<p>1) Reality. This part of the film centres around 2 South African women breaking away from their comfort zone, getting and keeping Jessie on the road and trying their utmost to reach their end goal despite endless challenges. This includes them saying farewell to Jessie - a surprising and moving end to their journey.</p>
<p>2) Factual documentary. This section will cover the American road network - the mystery, legends, secrets and revealing facts as narrated by Jessie. </p>

<h3><strong>Production</strong></h3>
<p>Shot with Go-Pro Hero cameras versions 4 &amp; 5 to get those near impossible angles on the move and a Canon 70D to cover some exceptional time-lapses.

<p> </p>
<h3>Post Production</h3>
<p>Ronet van der Walt has started the assembling of the film and will complete the edit at the end of April 2017. The real editorial challenge will be to give Jessie a personality, we want to anthropomorphise Jessie. Anthropomorphise means you give an animal or object human qualities, like ""Herbie the Love Bug"".</p>
<p>The Roads we drive on will also have a personality but this will constantly change depending on it's function in our film. At times dark, menacing and mean and at other times open, gentle and inspiring.</p>
<p>Another major factor in the post production will be music. Any good road trip must have great music. The more money we can raise the better our soundtrack will be and the more immersive the viewing experience will be. If we can afford it we'd like Jessie's theme song to be ""Fast Car"" by Tracy Chapman and the newer version by Jonas Blue ft. Dakota.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>We funded the project and film by selling basically everything we own. The funds we need to raise through Indiegogo will first and foremost pay for the finishing costs. See breakdown below (as of 18 March):</p>
<p>1 -  $ 1,500 - Audio Library</p>
<p><i>2 -  $ 1,500 - Graphics (changed 18 March)</i></p>
<p>3 -  $ 5,000 - On &amp; Offline Edit &amp; Facility Cost</p>
<p><i>4 - $ 1,500 - Stock Footage (changed 18 March)</i></p>
<p>5 -  $ 2,000 -  Audio Mix</p>
<p><i>6 -  $ 0 - Online Distribution (changed 18 March)</i></p>
<p>We will continue to raise funds beyond our $ 11,500 goal. We will use these extra funds to get the best possible soundtrack and to recoup funds spent in the past 6 months of production. This will also enable us to get going with our next project.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491222165/zssz3apicqihczzfim3c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What if we don't reach our Indiegogo goal?</h3>
<p>If we don't reach our Indiegogo goal by the 30th of April 2017 - we will still complete the film on time as scheduled and recoup our funds with either broadcast deals and/or our video on demand sales. Bottom line, everyone is getting what they paid for, no matter the final funding amount. The important thing for us is to keep moving forward and keep making inspirational films.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why are we making this film?</h3>
<p>For us this experience has been an extremely scary one. Not only from the first moment we climbed into Jessie but from the day in January 2016 we decided to go on this journey. For us it has been a daring move to positive change. While making this film and making many other ones, we hope to inspire people in a positive way with - Jessie, a little van in a very big country.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491221744/qpx7kfueq0dw8h6bzuhp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Keep Moving</strong></h3>
<p>We've braced a huge rainstorm in Washington, winter storm Decima in Arizona and the vicious snowstorm Helena in Clinton Oklahoma. We fought off a rat infestation in New Mexico, had two breakdowns, lost a few parts and bought a few brand new ones. Jessie nearly got us arrested in front of the White House and we almost got Jessie decapitated under a bridge in New York. But we made it through all 48 states in one piece. This journey is all about leaving behind what no longer works and keeping on moving forward against all odds.</p>
<p>At times philosophical, at times reality, at times even a bit gripping but always entertaining. Join Jessie and crew as they take you on a road trip through America as you've never seen it before. </p>
<h3>Our Next Project</h3>
<p>Our next project will be about the driving mentality on South African roads. While driving in America we realised how dangerous our South African roads are and how aggressive our drivers are. We're fascinated by the psychology playing out on our roads. While it is not the highest death rate in the world it is pretty high up on the list. We'll continue to do our research and we're planning on filming after we finish up the post production on Jessie.</p>

The Roads we drive on will also have a personality but this will constantly change depending on it's function in our film. At times dark, menacing and mean and at other times open, gentle and inspiring.
Another major factor in the post production will be music. Any good road trip must have great music. The more money we can raise the better our soundtrack will be and the more immersive the viewing experience will be. If we can afford it we'd like Jessie's theme song to be ""Fast Car"" by Tracy Chapman and the newer version by Jonas Blue ft. Dakota.

 
Funding
We funded the project and film by selling basically everything we own. The funds we need to raise through Indiegogo will first and foremost pay for the finishing costs. See breakdown below (as of 18 March):
1 -  $ 1,500 - Audio Library
2 -  $ 1,500 - Graphics (changed 18 March)
3 -  $ 5,000 - On & Offline Edit & Facility Cost
4 - $ 1,500 - Stock Footage (changed 18 March)
5 -  $ 2,000 -  Audio Mix
6 -  $ 0 - Online Distribution (changed 18 March)
We will continue to raise funds beyond our $ 11,500 goal. We will use these extra funds to get the best possible soundtrack and to recoup funds spent in the past 6 months of production. This will also enable us to get going with our next project.

 
What if we don't reach our Indiegogo goal?
If we don't reach our Indiegogo goal by the 30th of April 2017 - we will still complete the film on time as scheduled and recoup our funds with either broadcast deals and/or our video on demand sales. Bottom line, everyone is getting what they paid for, no matter the final funding amount. The important thing for us is to keep moving forward and keep making inspirational films.

 
Why are we making this film?
For us this experience has been an extremely scary one. Not only from the first moment we climbed into Jessie but from the day in January 2016 we decided to go on this journey. For us it has been a daring move to positive change. While making this film and making many other ones, we hope to inspire people in a positive way with - Jessie, a little van in a very big country.

Keep Moving
We've braced a huge rainstorm in Washington, winter storm Decima in Arizona and the vicious snowstorm Helena in Clinton Oklahoma. We fought off a rat infestation in New Mexico, had two breakdowns, lost a few parts and bought a few brand new ones. Jessie nearly got us arrested in front of the White House and we almost got Jessie decapitated under a bridge in New York. But we made it through all 48 states in one piece. This journey is all about leaving behind what no longer works and keeping on moving forward against all odds.
At times philosophical, at times reality, at times even a bit gripping but always entertaining. Join Jessie and crew as they take you on a road trip through America as you've never seen it before. 
Our Next Project
Our next project will be about the driving mentality on South African roads. While driving in America we realised how dangerous our South African roads are and how aggressive our drivers are. We're fascinated by the psychology playing out on our roads. While it is not the highest death rate in the world it is pretty high up on the list. We'll continue to do our research and we're planning on filming after we finish up the post production on Jessie.

Deehubs is the social network where people directly post in streets. We connect your online and physical world by the help of billboards and projectors. 
You are no longer limited with your Facebook friends or Twitter followers. Here we have new communication channel where you can spread your voice across the streets. Cities are new beautiful feed!

Check out the web site to see how it works: www.deehubs.com. 
One month ago we started Deehubs in Seattle and have already published 10,000 peoples' messages in streets. Now we want to bring our movement to every major U.S. city through our road-trip. Help us to get a car & gasoline.



Why we made Deehubs

Cause 1: In this world we have soldiers who fight without weapons all they have is their word. We want more people to hear their voice, SO WE MADE DEEHUBS

Below is the post published by one of the Deehubs' users on Dec 27, 2014: 


Cause 2: In this world we are all beautiful but not everyone realizes that. We need bigger mirrors to see, SO WE MADE DEEHUBS
Below is the selfie published by one of the Deehubs' users on Dec 21, 2014: 






Cause 3: In this world sometimes we are walking like machines. We will make you stop, activate your brain even just for a second, SO WE MADE DEEHUBS
Below is the status published by one of the Deehubs' users on Dec 22, 2014: 



Cause 4: We want to make streets more beautiful, SO WE MADE DEEHUBS

Below is the art published by one of the Deehubs' users on Dec 16 2014: 



Who We Are 


Three years ago we started Deehubs in our home country Georgia. We did not know how to write a single line of code and every single day we were drawing thousands of sketches. Our team gave up boring corporate lives, took loans and moved abroad to make Deehubs alive. 

When we started Deehubs in Seattle we had no connections, zero marketing budget and all the projectors were donated from strangers. We did not even have time to get permissions from property owners so we kept projecting until they liked it. Neverthless this is the best journey we had. 

Now we are close than ever to make our dreams come true. Everything depends on your contribution. 






Please Contribute 

One of our users posted on Seattle wall ""Right now my message is in a better place than me""... Deehubs is not the social network, it is the public stage where people feel important.
Seattle is great but we want our users to Own the American Streets and to spread their word everywhere. So we expand our movement and bring Deehubs to 25 U.S. cities through our road trip. People from all over the world will be able to publish their messages in the most popular U.S. cities. 

Please contribute and help us to get a car & gasoline. In exchange check amazing perks we offer to you.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey guys thank you for taking an interest in our short film. If you got this far then you must already have some experience with the board game Risk or have at least heard about it?</p>
<p>I have to admit I only played the game for the first time this year despite how old the game was and after playing my first game (and losing...badly) I knew I just had to make a story out of it. The fact that the game is hardly if ever referenced in pop culture or the media was baffling to me. If you thought Monopoly tears friends and family apart then oh boy you have got to play Risk. Think of a board game version of Game of Thrones where instead of being betrayed by Jaime Lannister's luscious locks you just got betrayed and kicked out of Australia by your best mate from school. Why James!?! Why?!?</p>
<p>Needless to say I jumped at the opportunity to turn this into a short and after a few more games and some heavy research I finally completed a script that I believe both fans of the game and story tellers can watch and enjoy. This will be the most intense film I have ever made and I knew that a pocket money budget was simply not enough to tell the story I wanted to tell. Compared with my previous films I decided to go a completely different route this time and I wasn't willing to compromise a great story to make my bank balance more pleasant to look at. Just like Risk you either fight and win or you fail and die. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.</p>
<p>We are looking for £600 to fund our short film. 30% of the funds will go towards the hiring of the studio location and it works on an hourly basis so we may have to reduce the amount of time of production if our 30% goal isn't reached. </p>
<p>No one can work on an empty stomach (I certainly dont) so 5% of the funds will go to feeding the cast and crew. This is incredibly important for obvious reasons and I wont cheat my actors and fellow filmmakers and believe that good grub creates good work.</p>
<p>55% of the funds will go towards expenses for the cast and crew. These people have given up their time and money for the production, the very least I can do is repay the favour. If we exceed the budget amount I will pay them extra for their hard work as Im a firm believer that no one should have to work for free. </p>
<p>The remaining 10% will go towards film festival distribution as some of them require significant funding to qualify for a screening. We will of course send the film to as many festivals as we can, including free film festivals to get as much exposure as possible. Who knows maybe we will win a few awards but I will equally be as happy if people were just able to see it. </p>
<p>Which brings me onto the perks. First off everyone who contributes will get a chance to see the film when it is finished. Please leave your email so that I can send you the link to the finished film. Some festivals require that I keep the film off the internet before sending it to festivals and although this policy is rare in most instances I cant guarantee that I wont attempt at a few of these as they're great exposure festivals but the delay will be minor at best and I will let everyone that has funded know about the delay to the films online viewing.</p>
<p>The £5 perk gives you a special thanks credit at the end of the film.</p>
<p>The £20 perk in addition of the £5 perk will get you a personal email from myself thanking you for contributing to the film.</p>
<p>The £50 perk in addition of the previous two perks grants you access to the set! You will get an all expenses paid trip to the production (provided you live in England) and get to hang out with the cast and crew for the day. </p>
<p>The £100 perk in addition of the previous three perks makes you an executive producer on the film. You get to remain updated on the film right through to the end of film festival distribution. You also get to join us on the set and give creative input on the film to see how your money is being spent.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div><p>I have the intention to send this short film to as many film festivals as humanly possible. Some are thankfully free of charge whilst others require a small fee so again your money really does help us to reach more people and more festivals. There hasnt been a short film quite like this one before so we are aiming for the highest exposure possible.</p></div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Im not going to lie, this film will be the most challenging film I have made to date as my budget usually consists of whats currently in my wallet on the day. The challenges regarding location costs and a larger than normal cast and crew expenses list will constantly eat away at me. However I am passionate and determined to make this film a success regardless of my goal and I will finish it the way I had envisioned it. Funding or no funding this film will be made. Although the quality of the production is up to you guys.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you cant spare a single penny we strongly urge you to share our campaign online to as many people as you can. Even if its just one person. If you are unable to help with funding then Im sure there is someone you know who would be interested in funding. Maybe someone you know whos played RISK before, maybe someone who is interested in short filmmaking or maybe even someone who is just filthy stinking rich ;)</p>
</div><div><p>Unlike Tesco, every little bit really does help with our project and I cannot wait to show you the finished film. We are all very excited.</p></div></div>","Short Summary

<p>Hello, my name is <a href=""http://about.me/D.B.Amburgey"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Amburgey</a> and I am the founder and creative director for <a href=""http://facebook.com/umbrellacafe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">UmbrellaCafe</a>. About six months ago, while filming a short over at Chicago’s Buckingham Fountain, I had the pleasure of meeting an amazing street-performer. Her name was Emily, but many people know her by her performance persona, the <a href=""https://twitter.com/emilyjjane"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Perkulator</a>. Once I wrapped up filming for my project, I captured some video of the Perkulator performing, and, being the life spectator I am, I was amazed with how she manipulated up to 5 hoops in a single setting with the grace and skill of a lioness driving down on-top of a kill. </p>
<p>I soon came to learn there were so many other talented performers throughout the city, and many of them liked to perform with fire in ways I never had seen before. Needless to say, after dipping my foot into the pool of fire and flow-art, I was hooked. I went from being a mere spectator and began producing highlight videos for anyone I could film, including the Perkulator, Eric Sipos, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tar-Foot/100689920103603"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tar-Foot</a>, and the troupe performers from <a href=""http://nightmagicdesigns.wix.com/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Night Magic Designs</a>. </p>
<p>I do admit that I love filming and editing videos for these different performers. Not only do I get to witness some amazing art in motion, I also get to share these performances with so many other people. But, the inner storyteller in me has been whispering for a while about doing something better, something bigger, something that tells a more complete story about these amazing performance artists. </p>
<p>That is why I want to produce a full-length documentary showcasing many of Chicago’s talented flow-artists, and why I want to deliver a story told by them that highlights these performers hopes and dreams while also examining the sacrifices many of these artists make to simply perform.  </p>

<h3>                           HOLEY MATRIMONY</h3>
<h3>                      Website, <a href=""http://www.HMfilm.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.HMfilm.org</a> </h3>
<p>In 2014 I made my first full length feature film, HOLEY MATRIMONY. It is a fun-filled romantic twists and turns 1948 period comedy with a triple surprise ending!  Not only was I Producer and Director but I am one of the stars and wrote the screenplay.  Two family friendly film distributors wanted the movie after seeing the trailer but I decided to keep control of the film for now.  Another distributor can place my movie in over 200 select theaters nationwide.  My film is already  completed, I would need to have it made into the DCP format necessary for commercial theaters to show.  Also, some of the best film festivals require a DCP rather then just a DVD or streaming to view.  THIS is where I need your help.  A professionally made DCP can cost between $3000 to $5000 each. </p>

                      Website, www.HMfilm.org 
In 2014 I made my first full length feature film, HOLEY MATRIMONY. It is a fun-filled romantic twists and turns 1948 period comedy with a triple surprise ending!  Not only was I Producer and Director but I am one of the stars and wrote the screenplay.  Two family friendly film distributors wanted the movie after seeing the trailer but I decided to keep control of the film for now.  Another distributor can place my movie in over 200 select theaters nationwide.  My film is already  completed, I would need to have it made into the DCP format necessary for commercial theaters to show.  Also, some of the best film festivals require a DCP rather then just a DVD or streaming to view.  THIS is where I need your help.  A professionally made DCP can cost between $3000 to $5000 each.

</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Iberian Peninsula is riddled with small
corners exuding history, art, beauty and exquisite gastronomy. Beyond the
general vision of Spain that one has both within and outside its borders, <b>the
intention of our team is to approach places which are overlooked both by
natives and foreigners</b>.</p>
<p>It is true that the Sagrada Familia, the Roman
Aqueduct of Segovia and the Alhambra in Granada are wonders worthy of the best
history books, and the sight before the eyes of those who observe will surely
fill them with awe with all their detail; or that some Spanish dishes and
restaurants have become world-famous. However, <b>the genuine explorer is not the
one who takes a look at a travel guide book and goes to the most highlighted
places: that is a tourist</b>.</p>
<p>The genuine explorer is the one who spends time with
the locals, the one who tries to understand and merge into the culture and go
all over the terrain looking for that point in time and space whose <i>je ne
sais quoi</i> activates all of his senses; the points which, for any other,
would normally go unnoticed.</p>
<p><b>We want to give a slightly different point of
view. We cannot guide you in your exploration, since this is a personal thing,
but what we can indicate, in a special, interesting way, are good paths to
start it with</b>.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1251150/files/20150226094823-2012-10-29_13.22.18.jpg?1424972903"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><b>THE IDEA</b></p>
<p>Several months ago, pilot Fernando García and
documentary maker Jesús Boyero (i.e.: <i>us</i>) made a recreational flight
above the Castilian Meseta. In the course of barely an hour and half flying, we
came across some 14<sup>th</sup> to 18<sup>th</sup> century churches and a
castle built in the 10<sup>th</sup> century, as the Spanish terrain is
interspersed with artistic representations and places of cultural, historic and
gastronomic interest which date back to the origins of humanity.</p>
<p>We are talking about temples, fortresses,
battlefields and monuments, separated by barely a few miles of land. And near
these, not only are there rivers, gorges and dams, but also the vast fields,
whose beautiful tonalities stretch as far as the horizon. <b>We realized then that
only a tiny part of the population has the possibility to habitually enjoy all
of these from a bird's eye view</b>.</p>
<p>It was then that the idea was born: <b>to make a
6-episode miniseries</b> in which the two friends, emulating the aviators who
explored new territories at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, <b>will
make visual missions all over the Spanish territory, to capture the beautiful
images of a land that already captivated Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians and
Romans more than two thousand years ago</b>.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><b></b></b></h3>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1251142/files/20150226094618-1546069_10152157591772369_1005601273_n.jpg?1424972778"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><b>THE PLANNED EXECUTION OF THE PROJECT</b></p>
<p><b>The total amount of donations will be allocated
to capital goods, merchandising, operating expenses and to finance the
extremely expensive flight hours</b>. Threfore, ours is a <b>non-profit project</b>. The
only thing we hope to achieve is a product which we can be proud of and you can
appreciate and take delight in.</p>
<p><b>Our main vehicle will be the Cessna 172</b>, for its
good safety, performance and flight hour cost. <b>You will be asking yourself, why 100 flight hours for 6 episodes? </b>Well, to obtain the priceless footage of Spain, we calculated that the average lenght of the flight will be 1200 miles/episode (600 miles to go and 600 to return), plus some extra for the second plane that will be filming us in some parts and another part for the fluctuations in the prices of the aviation fuel, that in Spain are incredibly expensive, so <b>we want to achieve 7200miles of flight across Spain plus the extra costs of the operation</b>. However, if we achieve the
funding needed, as a supplement we would include airplanes such as gliders or
acrobatic aircrafts so that the spectators can <b>experience the possibilities of
sport aviation</b>.</p>
<p>Regarding the flight style, the one we are
qualified for is visual navigation. Making use of aeronautical charts and the
Eventual Landing Fields Manual, our missions will consist of flying between 500
and 1.000 feet high (approx. 170-300 m.), overflying areas of special interest,
while commentating on them. Navigation will be done the old-fashioned way:
using a chart, a compass, a chronometer, and no GPS, to keep the true spirit of adventure alive. <b>Throughout the missions, we will stop in small airfields, from
which we will continue our exploration going deeper on land</b>.</p>
<p>Since communication in the Spanish general
aviation are carried out in the Spanish, we have decided to film the series in
this language. However, considering the potential interest outside of our
borders, at least we will subtitle them in English, and, in the case of
achieving the total amount of donations for the project, dubbing to
Shakespeare's mother tongue will be carried out.</p>

natives and foreigners.
It is true that the Sagrada Familia, the Roman
Aqueduct of Segovia and the Alhambra in Granada are wonders worthy of the best
history books, and the sight before the eyes of those who observe will surely
fill them with awe with all their detail; or that some Spanish dishes and
restaurants have become world-famous. However, the genuine explorer is not the
one who takes a look at a travel guide book and goes to the most highlighted
places: that is a tourist.
The genuine explorer is the one who spends time with
the locals, the one who tries to understand and merge into the culture and go
all over the terrain looking for that point in time and space whose je ne
sais quoi activates all of his senses; the points which, for any other,
would normally go unnoticed.
We want to give a slightly different point of
view. We cannot guide you in your exploration, since this is a personal thing,
but what we can indicate, in a special, interesting way, are good paths to
start it with.


THE IDEA
Several months ago, pilot Fernando García and
documentary maker Jesús Boyero (i.e.: us) made a recreational flight
above the Castilian Meseta. In the course of barely an hour and half flying, we
came across some 14th to 18th century churches and a
castle built in the 10th century, as the Spanish terrain is
interspersed with artistic representations and places of cultural, historic and
gastronomic interest which date back to the origins of humanity.
We are talking about temples, fortresses,
battlefields and monuments, separated by barely a few miles of land. And near
these, not only are there rivers, gorges and dams, but also the vast fields,
whose beautiful tonalities stretch as far as the horizon. We realized then that
only a tiny part of the population has the possibility to habitually enjoy all
of these from a bird's eye view.
It was then that the idea was born: to make a
6-episode miniseries in which the two friends, emulating the aviators who
explored new territories at the beginning of the 20th century, will
make visual missions all over the Spanish territory, to capture the beautiful
images of a land that already captivated Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians and
Romans more than two thousand years ago.




THE PLANNED EXECUTION OF THE PROJECT
The total amount of donations will be allocated
to capital goods, merchandising, operating expenses and to finance the
extremely expensive flight hours. Threfore, ours is a non-profit project. The
only thing we hope to achieve is a product which we can be proud of and you can
appreciate and take delight in.
Our main vehicle will be the Cessna 172, for its
good safety, performance and flight hour cost. You will be asking yourself, why 100 flight hours for 6 episodes? Well, to obtain the priceless footage of Spain, we calculated that the average lenght of the flight will be 1200 miles/episode (600 miles to go and 600 to return), plus some extra for the second plane that will be filming us in some parts and another part for the fluctuations in the prices of the aviation fuel, that in Spain are incredibly expensive, so we want to achieve 7200miles of flight across Spain plus the extra costs of the operation. However, if we achieve the
funding needed, as a supplement we would include airplanes such as gliders or
acrobatic aircrafts so that the spectators can experience the possibilities of
sport aviation.
Regarding the flight style, the one we are
qualified for is visual navigation. Making use of aeronautical charts and the
Eventual Landing Fields Manual, our missions will consist of flying between 500
and 1.000 feet high (approx. 170-300 m.), overflying areas of special interest,
while commentating on them. Navigation will be done the old-fashioned way:
using a chart, a compass, a chronometer, and no GPS, to keep the true spirit of adventure alive. Throughout the missions, we will stop in small airfields, from
which we will continue our exploration going deeper on land.
Since communication in the Spanish general
aviation are carried out in the Spanish, we have decided to film the series in
this language. However, considering the potential interest outside of our
borders, at least we will subtitle them in English, and, in the case of
achieving the total amount of donations for the project, dubbing to
Shakespeare's mother tongue will be carried out.

With so many veterans, officials, and scholars with real experience in the toughest wars and issues of our time, why weren't more of them being heard? We launched War on the Rocks because we thought we could do better. We carved out a small space on the internet where these voices could be heard, beginning in July 2013 (read our first anniversary note here).

<p>The Watergate Story is a documentary produced by Black Jacket Productions.  It will cover the development, construction, and impact of the Watergate Complex.  Richard Nixon’s scandal is widely known, but there are far more interesting stories around the Watergate’s creation than people realize.  The Watergate is an Italian-American work of art, which took over a decade to fully realize.  We will be working alongside Giuseppe Cecchi, the original project manager of the Watergate, to tell the story.  He will be the audience’s guide through the challenges faced in the nearly decade-long construction, opposition from the Washington DC government, the influence of the complex, and more.  The documentary will be shot in Washington DC, with post-production done in Chicago, Illinois.  Shooting is slated for Summer 2015, with a target completion by the end of 2015, in order to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Watergate East opening.  Once the documentary is complete we plan to enter it into film festivals and sell it as an educational video.</p>
<p>People will plan to interview include:</p>
<p>Giuseppe Cecchi - Project Manager</p>
<p>Bill Graff - Architect</p>
<p>David Rainey - Engineer</p>
<p>John Attus - Co-owner of Watergate Pastries</p>
<p>Gigi Winston - Daughter of Henry Winston, salesman of Watergate apartments<br/></p>
<p>Black Jacket Productions is a film production company in Chicago, IL, owned by Brandon Rackowski, a graduate of the Illinois Institute of Art - Chicago.</p>
<p>Other team members include Thomas Rackowski (producer), Don Reed (assistant director, research leader), Matthew Kakaris (director of photography), Freddie Benitez (assistant camera, motion graphics), Manal Hilana (makeup), Jenan Diab (researcher), Pat Locke (researcher) Jonathan Fairfield (editor), Natalie Gottinger (editor), Phillip Kissane (sound), Megan Tallman (researcher),  and Jacob Hagley (storyboard artist).</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>In order for this documentary to succeed, Black Jacket Productions will need to raise a budget to cover the costs of equipment rentals, crew, research team, travel expenses, copyright clearances, marketing costs, festival submissions, and more.  We have already raised enough funds to cover our pre-production costs. The money we raise from this campaign will go towards principal photography, equipment rentals, travel costs, and some post-production costs.</p>
<p>Our perks include production updates, a Black Jacket Productions t-shirt, a DVD copy of the finished documentary, and more coming soon.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
The Watergate Story is a documentary produced by Black Jacket Productions.  It will cover the development, construction, and impact of the Watergate Complex.  Richard Nixon’s scandal is widely known, but there are far more interesting stories around the Watergate’s creation than people realize.  The Watergate is an Italian-American work of art, which took over a decade to fully realize.  We will be working alongside Giuseppe Cecchi, the original project manager of the Watergate, to tell the story.  He will be the audience’s guide through the challenges faced in the nearly decade-long construction, opposition from the Washington DC government, the influence of the complex, and more.  The documentary will be shot in Washington DC, with post-production done in Chicago, Illinois.  Shooting is slated for Summer 2015, with a target completion by the end of 2015, in order to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Watergate East opening.  Once the documentary is complete we plan to enter it into film festivals and sell it as an educational video.
People will plan to interview include:
Giuseppe Cecchi - Project Manager
Bill Graff - Architect
David Rainey - Engineer
John Attus - Co-owner of Watergate Pastries
Gigi Winston - Daughter of Henry Winston, salesman of Watergate apartments
Black Jacket Productions is a film production company in Chicago, IL, owned by Brandon Rackowski, a graduate of the Illinois Institute of Art - Chicago.
Other team members include Thomas Rackowski (producer), Don Reed (assistant director, research leader), Matthew Kakaris (director of photography), Freddie Benitez (assistant camera, motion graphics), Manal Hilana (makeup), Jenan Diab (researcher), Pat Locke (researcher) Jonathan Fairfield (editor), Natalie Gottinger (editor), Phillip Kissane (sound), Megan Tallman (researcher),  and Jacob Hagley (storyboard artist).
   What We Need & What You Get 
In order for this documentary to succeed, Black Jacket Productions will need to raise a budget to cover the costs of equipment rentals, crew, research team, travel expenses, copyright clearances, marketing costs, festival submissions, and more.  We have already raised enough funds to cover our pre-production costs. The money we raise from this campaign will go towards principal photography, equipment rentals, travel costs, and some post-production costs.
Our perks include production updates, a Black Jacket Productions t-shirt, a DVD copy of the finished documentary, and more coming soon.
    The Impact

<b>Production Design: </b>Since ""Lily"" is a period piece the production design is a major component to the story. We are going to see Lily's life through the 50's, 60's and 70's and how her environment changed along with other aspects of her life as well. </div><div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Location:</b> Since we are creating a set and filming in the Jackie Liebergott Black Box Theatre at Emerson College, our main location, Lily's house is there. But we have two other locations we need to pay for in order to complete the film and Lily's story. </p>
<p><b>Food:</b> We need to feed the crew and cast while on set to thank them for all of their hard work. </p>
<p><b>Equipment:</b> Although Emerson College supplies a lot of the equipment, we will still need to rent some equipment, like walkie talkies, a dolly, lights and lenses from an outside supplier. </p>

Leanna Furtado - Producer


Leanna is a senior producing major at Emerson College. Leanna enjoys producing because she gets to follow a script from the beginning to the end of its journey.  When she started college she was torn between film and business, but found her true calling lying somewhere in between. She is passionate about ""Lily"" because of the story, its components and the crew involved. She plans on attending Emerson Los Angles in the fall and graduating in December. 


Liz LeMay - Co-Producer 

Originally from Pennsylvania, Liz is a Senior Film Production major at Emerson College. Liz enjoys studying film theory and likes to assistant direct on set, but her favorite part of filmmaking is producing. She loves being involved in the entire process - from choosing a great script to the moment it’s projected on the big screen. That’s why Liz has chosen to work on ""Lily"" and is very excited to be part of such an ambitious student film. She believes in hard work and collaboration, which are integral parts of filmmaking and in particular, ""Lily"".


Kimberly Kelmelis - Writer
 
Kim is a sophomore Film Production student at Emerson College. She has worked on set for various student productions as well as for Emerson
Channel, the school’s television station. She has worked closely
with the director to try to produce something very unique, inspiring, and relatable. Over the
past couple months, the script has become an ongoing journey, and something she is very
passionate about. Since the script holds the production together, it has become very important
to form a solid story, in order to set the foundation for this ambitious and intricate
production.




Michael Vitz-Wong - Director of Photography
Michael Vitz-Wong is a sophomore from Seattle, Washington. He loves light and learning how to manipulate it. When not on a film set he can be found making noise at a concert, making noise at a political rally, or making noise at a soccer game. His spirit animal is a river otter. 


Michael Chancellor - Production Designer



Michael Chancellor is attending Emerson College as a Theater Design & Technology major, with a minor in Dance, and is graduating this spring.  He has worked as a Set Designer on many plays and has recently started designing for TV Shows and films. He is excited for the challenge of showing the intimate progression of Lily across three decades and telling a visual story to accompany it.John Rosenkranz - Composer

John Rosenkranz, born and raised in Allentown New Jersey, is a composer currently in his last semester at Berklee College of Music pursuing a degree in Film Scoring. He has worked on a number of projects including ""Child's Play"" directed by Stephanie Mathews, and the indie video game ""Satellites"" from William De La Torre and Wynston Stanback to name more recent projects. John is eager to work on ""Lily in Particular"" and create music that defines the characters and story that Ernest and Kimberly so beautifully crafted.





Production Design: Since ""Lily"" is a period piece the production design is a major component to the story. We are going to see Lily's life through the 50's, 60's and 70's and how her environment changed along with other aspects of her life as well. 

Location: Since we are creating a set and filming in the Jackie Liebergott Black Box Theatre at Emerson College, our main location, Lily's house is there. But we have two other locations we need to pay for in order to complete the film and Lily's story. 
Food: We need to feed the crew and cast while on set to thank them for all of their hard work. 
Equipment: Although Emerson College supplies a lot of the equipment, we will still need to rent some equipment, like walkie talkies, a dolly, lights and lenses from an outside supplier. 
Development: This money goes toward paying actors who are SAG/AFTRA and unforeseen expenses. 
Transportation: Since we are recreating a home inside a theatre, we will need to rent trucks to transport the many props and  all of the equipment to the location. 




With any short film there are tons of risks.The fact that we are making a period piece is a large risk itself, but we are excited for the challenge.  Other possible risks include the locations might fall through, something could break, or we might not reach our funding goal. With this money we will be able to handle problems that might be out of our control.

Inspired by TRUE events, Through Maria's Eyes is the story of Gizella, a poor young jewish woman, who takes on the identity of Maria in order to save her family and herself from persecution in 1944 Hungary. Her family's lives, as well as her own, depend on the callous exterior that Maria must maintain in the midst of unimaginable atrocities with only hope and determination illuminating her way as she fights for survival.

        This project was conceived by filmmaker/producer David Rich in homage to the real life person who the film is based on.  Upon further research he found that there weren't many true life heroine stories being told on film or in literary form that were based on these events.  As a producer and director of several feature films himself, he has taken it upon himself to bring the story of this family to the big screen.   A challenge that is guaranteed to take our contributors and general audience on an unexpected ride of emotions seen through the eyes of our heroin.

We have spent that last two years learning and practicing a specific discipline within the filmmaking program and we will put all of our efforts together and made a great film. 
We completed filming this past weekend and it was grueling, but AMAZING!!! Now we just need to recoup some of the expenses.  

The Flick

Our film is a gritty thriller that explores the mental state of a rape victim and what happens to the person or people who are responsible.

<p>Your assistance will help me get this script produced. I've budgeted this project to be as low cost as conceivable. You're donation will also prove that a quality show can be produced at a rock bottom budget.</p>
<p>I have amazing actors and a wonderful assistant producer. They are not only qualified to help me create this story, they are wonderfully enthusiastic about this project as well. We will be going into production on March 22, 2015, but we will continue to take donations to reach our production goal. If we go to series, each episode will feature an unsigned singer.</p>
<h3>What we need and What You Get:</h3>
<p>The challenge is to obtain the right amount of money to fully produce this project. I need money to pay my actors and crew. What you get is a high quality production at a shoestring budget. What a concept! Consider this project the ""Hollywood Shuffle"" of Online Television.</p>
<p>If I can't reach my full budget, I will still be able to complete the project with some deferred pay to a few actors, but the project will still be able to be awesome.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have learned a lot from my fellow filmmakers and have done what I can to avoid classic mistakes. I have an amazing cast. I have a great, and proven director of photography and sound director. I have succeeded in finding awesome locations.</p>
<p>However, there are obstacles that may still arise. Promoting my project after accomplishment is always a challenge for filmmakers. However, my experience in social media and my strong connections to the local communities such as We Make Movies are both invaluable and will allow me to over come this hurdle.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p> <ul> <li>Social media: Ask your followers and friends to help out of you can't. </li> <li>Use the Indiegogo share tools to help as well.

    The Impact
Have you ever been lied to ? Have you ever been cheated on? Have you ever felt as if you had no one you can trust? Have you ever felt as if you didn't  know where your life was going? Have you ever just wanted to escape reality to DREAM. 

This movie entails all these aspects and so much more. I want to do more than just tell a story. I want to make an impact. 
 If you make a contribution to this film I promise you will not regret it.

<h3>Eflahfluflah!</h3>
<p>It's a fairly simple story of good versus evil, but crammed full of funny animation and pop culture references, as well as private jokes even I'm not in on (such as the tiny sheep hidden in every storyboard panel and throughout the film!).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476085559/hrbbqhgqm1pfmez2v2pz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>They've spent over 300 hours working on the project and have written a script, storyboarded it and had the dialogue professionally recorded. They've designed and animated characters using various techniques, from 2D to life size stop motion. Did I mention it's a very ambitious project?!</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yGpXeFWtEw?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<h3><strong>Who are we? How did this project even begin?</strong></h3>
<p>I'm a freelance animator and I've been volunteering with children and young people for over five years. A group of teenagers volunteer alongside me at the junior youth club, running the tuck shop, serving drinks and even washing up!</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LnKOPqrEdAU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>They kept volunteering, even when the senior club had to close. I felt they deserved rewarding, so began running this project in January 2015. Here they are on day one, pitching their story:</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/vgXrVzTd2r8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Well, you wouldn't want us to give away the whole plot! Sadly, the group was shut down in December. I changed venues but, unbelievably, I recently learned that the building we moved to will be closing down soon as well!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>I'll go into more detail in an update, but mainly I need to raise enough funds to pay someone to help me run the group, which could cost over £3000 for a year.</p>
<p>As well as working for free, I haven't charged them anything to take part and I'd like it to remain that way. I've covered material costs myself so far, but it would be nice if we could raise enough funds that I didn't have to!</p>
<p>I've also pledged my fee from a music video I recently made to the project, but again it would be nice if I didn't have to!</p>
<p>I'll also need to cover the cost of Indiegogo and other fees (almost 10%) and the perks we're offering.</p>
<h2>PERKS!</h2>
<p>Firstly, I've put a long lead time on some perks because many campaigns fail to meet their initial estimates - my aim is to deliver early! July 2018 will be the absolute cut-off point for this project because that's when the kids will finish high school. Hopefully the film will be finished much sooner!</p>
<p>Some perks will be sent immediately - before I even receive funds from Indiegogo - as a sign of trust.</p>
<p>Every contributor will receive a credit in the film. The kids will be creating some original artwork, which will also be available as T-shirts and posters. There will also be opportunities to appear in the film as caricatures.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476126024/uu4pgnaq2llmqoqwteaz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>They're also going to write some small roles into the film, so a select few will have the opportunity to join us at our next recording session to voice these extra characters.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/wr3cj6yxeig?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>There are a few live action scenes and for one we'll need an army of ninjas, so you could have the opportunity to appear in the film for real!</p>
<p>I'll also be offering my services at a huge discount. For example, for half the normal price, you could have a go at light painting using my <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY5ZQhZt0HY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pixelstick</a> to create images like this (100% in camera - no Photoshop here!):</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476543908/rgqbiaicm9c8r9cbgidk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We're going to add more perks later and every contributor will receive early access to our secret perks, which won't become publicly available for a few weeks.</p>
<h3>So, why should you contribute?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I asked the kids to think about this so they did some brainstorming. They came up with a few compelling reasons (in their typically humorous fashion!):</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476088127/vudhqzvdtgd6bekekd9r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul><li>Teenagers often get a bad rap, but these are good kids who have been volunteering for several years. They're willing to do even more in return for your help - they're not just looking for handouts:</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Each time they reach a certain milestone, such as every £100 raised, they're willing to do some voluntary community service, such as litter picking.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Last year they put their project on hold to help me run a community event. More recently they helped me make a music video:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><a href=""http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/events/feel-9-videos-premiere"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/events/feel-9-videos-premiere</a></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I help them so they want to help me in return, because they understand the meaning of gratitude. Here is just one of the ways they've shown their appreciation:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476095415/swcruxjf6ey5wsnocmam.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul><li>The group is mainly comprised of girls who are into technology and animation. This isn't just a fad; they've interested and engaged and have stuck to it for almost two years because this is what they're passionate about.</li></ul>
<ul><li>They need your help because nobody else has really helped them yet:</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I haven't found any volunteers and couldn't find any grants I'm even eligible to apply for as an individual.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The church where they continue to volunteer has closed their youth club and the project I began to replace it. They're willing to let us use the building for free, which is very generous. But at the same time, this doesn't help much because I can't run the group alone.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Similarly, I was allowed to move the group to a council run youth club. But due to budget cuts, soon they ""will no longer deliver any open access youth activities"" meaning the building will soon be closing and there will be no provision for local young people at all.</p>
<ul><li>If those reasons aren't compelling enough, here's a brief message from The Queen:</li></ul>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJ_NwbjIIMA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p>Erm, thanks for that, Queen Snail, but I think you may have misunderstood what we're trying to achieve here... [Did you spot the sheep?]</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

Eflahfluflah!
It's a fairly simple story of good versus evil, but crammed full of funny animation and pop culture references, as well as private jokes even I'm not in on (such as the tiny sheep hidden in every storyboard panel and throughout the film!).

They've spent over 300 hours working on the project and have written a script, storyboarded it and had the dialogue professionally recorded. They've designed and animated characters using various techniques, from 2D to life size stop motion. Did I mention it's a very ambitious project?!

Who are we? How did this project even begin?
I'm a freelance animator and I've been volunteering with children and young people for over five years. A group of teenagers volunteer alongside me at the junior youth club, running the tuck shop, serving drinks and even washing up!

They kept volunteering, even when the senior club had to close. I felt they deserved rewarding, so began running this project in January 2015. Here they are on day one, pitching their story:

Well, you wouldn't want us to give away the whole plot! Sadly, the group was shut down in December. I changed venues but, unbelievably, I recently learned that the building we moved to will be closing down soon as well!

What We Need
I'll go into more detail in an update, but mainly I need to raise enough funds to pay someone to help me run the group, which could cost over £3000 for a year.
As well as working for free, I haven't charged them anything to take part and I'd like it to remain that way. I've covered material costs myself so far, but it would be nice if we could raise enough funds that I didn't have to!
I've also pledged my fee from a music video I recently made to the project, but again it would be nice if I didn't have to!
I'll also need to cover the cost of Indiegogo and other fees (almost 10%) and the perks we're offering.
PERKS!
Firstly, I've put a long lead time on some perks because many campaigns fail to meet their initial estimates - my aim is to deliver early! July 2018 will be the absolute cut-off point for this project because that's when the kids will finish high school. Hopefully the film will be finished much sooner!
Some perks will be sent immediately - before I even receive funds from Indiegogo - as a sign of trust.
Every contributor will receive a credit in the film. The kids will be creating some original artwork, which will also be available as T-shirts and posters. There will also be opportunities to appear in the film as caricatures.

They're also going to write some small roles into the film, so a select few will have the opportunity to join us at our next recording session to voice these extra characters.

There are a few live action scenes and for one we'll need an army of ninjas, so you could have the opportunity to appear in the film for real!
I'll also be offering my services at a huge discount. For example, for half the normal price, you could have a go at light painting using my Pixelstick to create images like this (100% in camera - no Photoshop here!):

We're going to add more perks later and every contributor will receive early access to our secret perks, which won't become publicly available for a few weeks.
So, why should you contribute?

I asked the kids to think about this so they did some brainstorming. They came up with a few compelling reasons (in their typically humorous fashion!):

Teenagers often get a bad rap, but these are good kids who have been volunteering for several years. They're willing to do even more in return for your help - they're not just looking for handouts:
Each time they reach a certain milestone, such as every £100 raised, they're willing to do some voluntary community service, such as litter picking.
Last year they put their project on hold to help me run a community event. More recently they helped me make a music video:
http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/events/feel-9-videos-premiere
I help them so they want to help me in return, because they understand the meaning of gratitude. Here is just one of the ways they've shown their appreciation:

The group is mainly comprised of girls who are into technology and animation. This isn't just a fad; they've interested and engaged and have stuck to it for almost two years because this is what they're passionate about.
They need your help because nobody else has really helped them yet:
I haven't found any volunteers and couldn't find any grants I'm even eligible to apply for as an individual.
The church where they continue to volunteer has closed their youth club and the project I began to replace it. They're willing to let us use the building for free, which is very generous. But at the same time, this doesn't help much because I can't run the group alone.
Similarly, I was allowed to move the group to a council run youth club. But due to budget cuts, soon they ""will no longer deliver any open access youth activities"" meaning the building will soon be closing and there will be no provision for local young people at all.
If those reasons aren't compelling enough, here's a brief message from The Queen:

 
Erm, thanks for that, Queen Snail, but I think you may have misunderstood what we're trying to achieve here... [Did you spot the sheep?]

Risks & Challenges
These kids have already faced a number of challenges that couldn't have been anticipated, but they haven't given up yet.
Whatever we raise here it will help keep the project going that bit longer and as long as the kids remain interested and engaged, I'll continue looking into ways to keep the project running.
Worst case scenario, I'm willing to fund the project myself but this will be a huge sacrifice as I don't currently earn much. Firstly, I'll have to introduce fees to attend, and I'll have to give up all the other volunteering I do, so that I can take on more paid work to cover the cost.

Other Ways You Can Help
I realise not everyone can afford to contribute, so if you can't then please share this page with everyone you know instead.

What donations will pay for




We'd like to bring on a paid director and editor to pound out this project. We're budgeting $3,000 per position for a two-day shoot. That's $6,000.


Extras and cast! If we want to show deportation, or show Muslim-Americans in holding cells to create a more visceral experience for viewers, we need extras to act those parts. We’ll need to pay the extras, actors to play the principle roles, and provide food. We're budgeting $80 per extra per day, and $200 per principal per day — standard rates for non-union actors. With 15 to 20 extras, that's about $4,000.


Costuming and locations. We want the cast and set to look authentic such that it doesn't distract viewers from the story. This may mean purchasing uniforms for guards, clothes for actors without their own costumes, and renting appropriate spaces. We’re budgeting $3,000 to pay for wardrobe for up to 20 people, and to rent / license two to three locations. 


Stretch Goals: Marketing and PR material. I already mentioned absurd mobile games, and I’m paying for those out of my own pocket. But we’d also like to add the aforementioned VR and wig monster short. Virtual reality requires extreme specialization to produce, as does a CG monster movie scene. We’d bring in some Hollywood expertise for those. The VR scene would cost an estimated $10,000 to produce, edit, and publish, and the CG scene would cost an estimated $30,000. Once again, these are stretch goals. But we’d love to make them happen in time for November!




What's the deal with the oddball perks?
We'd be remiss to ask you to contribute without offering a tangible 'thank you' gift. The different perks are admittedly very random, and it's because our perks come from people all over the country in various industries.


We'll be adding more perks throughout the month. Donate now and you'll be able to change your perk selection in the coming weeks if you see something you like better. Instructions for changing perks can be found here.

   Risks & Challenges  
Perhaps the biggest challenge our production faces is timing. To release before November and garner meaningful attention, we need to wrap shooting by the end of September. That means we need to finalize the script, scout locations, and cast the film by early September at the latest.
To ensure we can meet these deadlines, we're choosing locations that will be easy to shoot with minimal set builds, and we'll only progress to more intensive scenes if we have the financing to hire additional crew and talent.

   Other Ways You Can Help 
If you can't contribute financially, here are a few things you can do:

If you're an artist or a business owner, you can contribute a perk. Artwork, downloads, albums, discounts or free services all help the cause. As contributors donate, I'll add your perks to the list. You can contact me directly at eric@eric-mcclellan.com for directions.


You can share the campaign with friends or family who'd like to help. We've got a tight deadline and every share counts!

So partner with us, the unlikely startup marketer and the uber-professional high school students, to make a difference in this election.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhy should I give my money to you? Wouldn’t donating to another candidate’s campaign be more effective?A donation to our production would be MUCH more effective in generating emotion due to the disadvantages of a candidate’s official campaign. First, political campaigns involve bureaucracy, which eats up funds and slows things down. Second, our team can afford to be provocative in ways other candidates can’t. If candidates become extremely emotional, controversial or provocative, their ‘presidential character’ becomes questionable. We want reasoned, adult dignity from the leader of the free world, not silly, video-game producing, short-film directing eccentricity.  Do you really think you can change the hearts and minds of the voting public?Some people will never be swayed. But some either 1) haven't decided whom they're voting for or 2) are tentative Trump supporters who may be affected by a compelling message. Like Ryan in his article, I have family members who wax and wane in their support for Trump. Those that can be influenced by our message will be influenced. This one’s for you, Dad!!!Wait, I’m a Republican, and by discouraging support for Trump, aren't you in fact strengthening Hillary's campaign?Hillary's campaign becomes stronger with each of its own supporters, not its detractors. If you don't vote for Trump and don't vote for Hillary, your vote contributes to neither.I like your campaign but none of your perks are compelling to me. What should I do?Donate and go buy yourself an ice cream. Or donate and I'll buy you an ice cream. Or donate and enjoy the treat of a Trump-free Oval Office.I like all your perks and want them all! What should I do?Donate lots and lots of money. I'll send you all the perks and I'll buy you ice cream.You mentioned phone games. Really?Yep. Really. At the time of writing, I've got two in development. Donate any amount to receive release notifications.You mentioned virtual reality. Really?Yep. We're currently discussing possibilities with a VR production company.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>WHY ANOTHER ZOMBIE THING? </h3>
<p>Zombies are literally everywhere. You can find them groaning and shuffling their way through our daily lives, whether it be in television, movies, video games, or even books. We all know what zombies are and what they do. We all know that the only way to kill a zombie is by destroying it's brain. We've all seen it done a million times... And so have Tribulation's protagonists.</p>
<p>The web series takes place in a world where zombies exist in pop culture. The show's teenage leads know exactly what they're getting into when the news mentions a contagious virus that leads to cannibalism.</p>
<p>Besides, I like to think of Tribulation as more of a coming of age drama series than anything else. It's center characters are young and have not yet even experienced adulthood. They are still finding themselves, and now have to do that in a world where death is always lingering right around the corner... In the form of a pale, flesh eating monster who looks just like your lively next door neighbor, Bill.</p>
<p>Oh wait, that is Bill... And he doesn't look so lively.</p>
<h3>MEET THE CREATORS</h3>
<p>Put two zombie obsessed actors/filmmakers in a room and you're bound to get some kind of zombie based creation in return.</p>
<p>Cole Daniel Hills (14 years old) is a young independent filmmaker who, in his past, has won the 'best movie' award in an east coast film competition for the film, AGE OF KAOS. He has been writing stories since he was six years old and screenplays since he was nine. </p>
<p>James Achille (24 years old) is a veteran actor from New York. If his charm and charisma weren't already enough to make Tribulation a success, his newfound interest in writing and behind-the-camera work are sure to make everybody a happy zombie.</p>

<h3>Why You Should Support This</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Daisy Burroughs!</p>
<p>I was born in Columbia, SC and lived the for the majority of my life with my mom, older sister, and younger brother.  I moved to York County in 2010 to attend Winthrop University and earned my Bachelor's degree in Mass Communication in 2014.</p>
<p>While at Winthrop, I served my campus community as a Peer Mentor, Winthrop Ambassador, Resident Assistant, Orientation Leader, Student Coordinator of Leadership Initiatives, President of the Xi Beta Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., and 2013 Homecoming Queen. When not on campus, I volunteered with a number of community organization but spent the most time with the United Way of York County with students entering the 6th grade and Youth Corps, a youth leadership development program I participated in as a sophomore at Spring Valley High School.</p>
<p>Youth Corps empowered me to know that I could be a leader.  Through participating in that program, I overcame being bullied, having no self-esteem, and a sense of shame from having witnessed domestic violence at home.  I was able to connect with peers in a way that allowed for lifelong friendships. It was an eye-opening experience that I was afforded through the sponsorship from First Citizens Bank.</p>
<p>I am a living testimonial of the impact great role models &amp; leadership development can have on an impressionable teenager. I am forever indebted to First Citizens and Youth Corps for taking a shy and insecure girl and instilling her with the tools and confidence to impact others.</p>
<p>Now, it's my turn! Currently, I'm 24 years old. I will graduate with my Master of Business Administration degree in December 2016. I serve on the Board of Directors for the Greater York Chamber of Commerce. I am also a Community Ambassador for the Boys &amp; Girls Club of York County. I want to show other young people who think they may be too shy or too awkward to follow their dreams that nothing is holding them back!</p>
<p> My dream is to compete in my first pageant and I need your help (and prayers) to make that happen!</p>
<p>The goal for this campaign is $2400. Any funding left in excess of pageant expenses will be used to sponsor a 9th or 10th grader to participate in Youth Corps during the 2017-2018 academic year (as participants for the 2016-2017 class have already been selected).</p>
<p>I know that with your help, this dream will become a reality! Please support my journey!</p>
<p>Thank you! </p>

Hi! I'm Daisy Burroughs!
I was born in Columbia, SC and lived the for the majority of my life with my mom, older sister, and younger brother.  I moved to York County in 2010 to attend Winthrop University and earned my Bachelor's degree in Mass Communication in 2014.
While at Winthrop, I served my campus community as a Peer Mentor, Winthrop Ambassador, Resident Assistant, Orientation Leader, Student Coordinator of Leadership Initiatives, President of the Xi Beta Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., and 2013 Homecoming Queen. When not on campus, I volunteered with a number of community organization but spent the most time with the United Way of York County with students entering the 6th grade and Youth Corps, a youth leadership development program I participated in as a sophomore at Spring Valley High School.
Youth Corps empowered me to know that I could be a leader.  Through participating in that program, I overcame being bullied, having no self-esteem, and a sense of shame from having witnessed domestic violence at home.  I was able to connect with peers in a way that allowed for lifelong friendships. It was an eye-opening experience that I was afforded through the sponsorship from First Citizens Bank.
I am a living testimonial of the impact great role models & leadership development can have on an impressionable teenager. I am forever indebted to First Citizens and Youth Corps for taking a shy and insecure girl and instilling her with the tools and confidence to impact others.
Now, it's my turn! Currently, I'm 24 years old. I will graduate with my Master of Business Administration degree in December 2016. I serve on the Board of Directors for the Greater York Chamber of Commerce. I am also a Community Ambassador for the Boys & Girls Club of York County. I want to show other young people who think they may be too shy or too awkward to follow their dreams that nothing is holding them back!
 My dream is to compete in my first pageant and I need your help (and prayers) to make that happen!
The goal for this campaign is $2400. Any funding left in excess of pageant expenses will be used to sponsor a 9th or 10th grader to participate in Youth Corps during the 2017-2018 academic year (as participants for the 2016-2017 class have already been selected).
I know that with your help, this dream will become a reality! Please support my journey!
Thank you!

</p><p></p><p><b>High-Quality Urban
Entertainment</b></p>
<p>HUETV is a group of Film Makers and innovators who want to make
a difference and give people of color a voice in the media. HUETV is developing
an online network of news, web-series and shareable shorts for social media.
HUETV aims to bring viewers the news that matters and provide well informed
stories that can be relied upon to tell the truth, not fabricate information to
make investors happy. </p>
<p>HUETV already has established links with Hollywood producers and
broadcasters and each one has turned down the opportunity to fund our mission.
According to them, there is no money to be made from catering to the needs of
the world’s Black, Hispanic, Indian, and Asian communities (to name just a few)
who are all grossly underrepresented (or unfairly represented) in mainstream
media. Which is why HUETV aims to change that, one show at a time, bringing
viewers exciting new content without the stereotypes. </p>
<p>To achieve this goal, HUETV is looking for start-up investments
to film a web series called “In the Sea”, and bring together a news team to
report on the news our viewers care about. We are asking for your help to raise
$20,000 dollars which will be the first step in this news and entertainment revolution.</p>
<p><b>NEWS</b></p>
<p>HUETV will rid the news of stereotypes and one-sided reporting.
There will be no more mis-information to deceive the public. HUETV will ensure
people of color are well represented in the media by getting the facts from
reporters who look and sound like the people they report for. HUETV will
develop timely coverage of breaking news, and provide educated commentary for a
diverse America.</p>
<p><b>Web-series and Films</b></p>
<p>HUETV will be acquiring indie content and welcomes every film
that fits with our values. First and foremost will be the (first of many)
web-series “In The Sea”. So many great films are being developed with people of
color that Hollywood is turning down. HUETV will acquire those films and give
viewers a choice. HUETV will give film makers with great dramas, thrillers,
documentaries, or whatever type of indie film, a place to showcase their work,
gain reviews and grow their fan base.</p>
<p><b>SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING
EXACTLY?</b></p>
<p>HUETV is creating a streaming website that will show news,
web-series, and, later, movies developed by people of color, with access to
24-hour news from anchors that look like <i>all
of America</i> not just a portion of it. The more contributions, the quicker
HUETV can fill the studio with awesome actors, design a beautiful set, and
begin filming the first of many shows that will challenge the mainstream
programming status quo. </p>
<p><b>HOW WE WILL USE YOUR MONEY</b></p>
<p>(MORE MONEY=MORE WEB SERIES+COOLER PERKS)</p>

website ever developed and creating and shipping the incentives listed below.

the list but with your help it can get our first foot forward. </p>
<p><b>Here’s what that means for you!</b></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm Actor/Entertainer Mell Bowser(<i><strong>The Have and the Have Nots, Dear White People</strong></i>).. Through the acting and entertaining I've been blessed to make it out of circumstances a lot of at risk youth fall victim to. I truly believe once you make it out, you have to reach back and pull others out.</p>
<p>Back in 2016 I released a project called ""All The Wrong Places"" <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n23lWJ3oDTY&amp;list=PLUZ2StaGWG8DSusXa00hnQ-NYwDA4NiqQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n23lWJ3oDTY&amp;list=PLUZ2StaGWG8DSusXa00hnQ-NYwDA4NiqQ</a>. That project set me up for this one because it was a learning experience on how to make a film.</p>
<p>This project is different with it being an inspirational piece that I have hopes of motivating youth, or anyone for that matter, to listen to their heart and chase their passions because that is truly how you free yourself.</p>
<p>This project means so  much to me because it will be the first project I get to go home and shoot with the youth of MY city. Giving them a perspective on a career choice they've never seen while keeping them busy. </p>
<p>Its also loosely based on MY life and journey to Hollywood!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We will need at least <u><i><strong>$20,000 </strong></i></u> to pull this off.</p>
<p>That money will go towards;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paying for cast and crew(which includes the youth i'll hire)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hotel room bookings</strong></li>
<li><strong>Food</strong></li>
<li><strong>Transportation(flights from LA for some cast &amp; crew)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fees for rentals such as lights &amp; cameras</strong></li>
<li><strong>Location dues</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, I will make this project with whatever I have by a certain date(yet to be determined but aiming for September/August 2017) but the more the merrier!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that all donations are a TAX WRITE OFF!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation will make a change in many of children's lives around the world! We are visual creatures and kids need positive sights to know that ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE no matter where you come from. This project will be that visual.</p>
<p>Lets change a child's life! WE have that power and obligation to make this world better for the ones who come after us!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With anything great, the risks and challenges arent too far behind.. or ahead.</p>
<p>Funding is usually the biggest obstacle filmmakers have when making a project. Once we get this out of the way it will definitely push the project to the next stage.</p>
<p>What I learned from my other project is; things never go as planned but I will stay ready for whatever challenges come to us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cant contribute financially, PLEASE share this post and tell at least one person about it! Every little bit helps.</p>
<p>Also if you are looking to invest or would like to talk business, I speak that language. Please reach out for more info.</p>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p><i>Rosewood Ledge</i> captures the intersection between a woman whose life is shattering around her and a young couple in a destructive relationship. </p>
<p>The couple, a model and her photographer boyfriend, are shooting on a lake upstate when the property owner exhibits unusual behavior.</p>
<p>Although their meeting is serendipitous, the choices they make while together force them to confront who they really are.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Director's Statement</h3>
<p>Rosewood Ledge centers around three unlikely but intertwined themes: image obsession, burnt-out romance, and alcoholism. As the characters developed, I focused on understanding what motivated their troubled behaviors, and discovered a strangely beautiful irony. For all of the pain in the character’s narratives, there is equally as much humor and lightness in them.</p>
<p>Whether this story is a comedy or tragedy depends on how it’s told, and my goal is to tell it as both. I believe that real life is full of this duality and reflecting that is the most honest form of storytelling I can do. I hope that viewers will watch Rosewood Ledge and see the beauty in narratives with this dark and light irony, and  perhaps see their own experiences reflected in the characters' struggles and triumphs.</p>

Where the Money Goes

For us to tell this story right, we’re going to need a gorgeous lake house, top-of-the-line camera gear, and the most talented cast and crew we know. Filmmaking adds up fast, and even if we reach our our goal of $15k we'll have to be very careful with distributing funds so each department gets what it needs.
The biggest allocations go towards locations, equipment, and post production, since we can't cut any corners with these departments if we want the film to look incredible. We have an exceptionally talented cast and crew who have agreed to work on the project for very generous ""friend-discounted"" rates,  but even so these fees accumulate, and we feel it's important that we compensate our team to the best of our ability. The other stuff (food, travel, and IndieGoGo Fees) are necessary costs that we'll have to be as frugal as possible with so we can spend more in the creative departments.

Other Ways You Can Help
Every contribution helps us get one step closer to reaching our goal, no matter how much it is. You can also help us out by spreading the word, since we never know who might be interested!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Nina Cudic and I am a writer, actress and a producer of The Airport. This is the second short film I wrote but the first one to shoot. Originally from Croatia, I have been acting in NYC for about three years now, and have experience in theater and film and am currently in the longest running play in NYC called ''Line'' which takes place at 13th St Repertory Theater in NYC. </p>
<p>The Airport short film is an emotional drama which takes place at the airport in its entirety. It is the story about the airport and the life that goes on there. It shows the diversity of life that can take place at the airport throughout one night. It follows seven stories of seven main characters whose paths are intertwined throughout one night at the New York airport.</p>
<p>This film is important to me because through it I want to express the intensity, vulnerability, unpredictability, uncertainty, diversity, ups and downs of life which can all be found at one place - the airport. The airport is a magical place which goes through hundreds of emotions on a daily basis. It is so compelling and emotionally rich. I also want to express the compassion, constant movement and the unity of human beings through this film. </p>
<p>If you contribute to this film with your desired donation, it would help me and my fellow crew members to make this powerful piece come to life and it would be a dream come true! We have very creative ideas about how to make this story work and express itself in the most artistic, yet realistic way. We have everything planned, how to develop the story, which location to use etc. but we need your help, especially for the location needs because it is so unique and crucial to this story! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to collect 32,500$ by November 2nd 2016. The location cost is 16,000$ for three days of shooting. Equipment cost is around 5,000$. We need a crew of about 15 people and 5 actors and around 6,500$ is for their payment. The rest, about 5,000$ is for transportation and meals for cast, crew and extras. We need a crew of about 15 people, 5 actors and 30 extras. </p>
<p>Everything stated above is for 3 days (nights) of shoot in November this year.</p>
<p>We offer some unique perks for our contributors such as imdb credits, ''thank you'' credits, producer, co-producer, associate producer and executive producer credits if you donate certain amounts. We also offer any video or acting reel editing, professional photo sessions, headshot photo sessions, make up and hair styling services, set visit during the shoot and many more! Check out the ''perks'' section for more!</p>
<p>If we don't reach the entire goal, the money will still go to the movie making, but we will have to postpone the shoot in order to raise/get more money for it. We have the November date set already and it is very important to shoot the film then because we want to submit it to one New York based Film Festival before the last December deadline expires. We stated the amounts that are crucial to the making of this film and without them we will not be able to do it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We hope that with this project we will bring attention to what really airport means: It is a place where so many heartbreaking, thrilling and exciting things happen and the perfect location to show the diversity of life and life situations that can occur within one night at the same place. We want to show the diversity of people and their vulnerable human nature we can all relate to.</p>
<p>We plan to submit this project to one big film festival. The last deadline for that festival is in the beginning of December. That is our first goal. Then, we also plan to apply it to the film festivals throughout the globe. We really hope our art can reach and touch as many people as possible. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div><p>The risks and challenges we may face are not reaching our goal and having to cancel or postpone the project. That is why we want to reward our contributors with different perks and are willing to satisfy our contributors. By that I mean that for certain given amounts to this project, our contributors will be able to choose between the variety of the perks offered. We offer perks for both men, women, actors and non actors, nationally and internationally.</p></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute that doesn't mean that you can't help!</p>
<p>It would be immensely helpful to us if you could get the word out and make some noise about our campaign, meaning that you could share with your family, friends and others our project on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, through email or any other social network!

Would you be able to live with yourself knowing they were being destroyed and you did nothing? We must defend them against any force, voice, or individual that wants to rob them of their great purpose and value!!        My plan was to fund the documentary completely on my own steam but, as it turns out, I too need help.  We need financing  to complete the post production phase.  We can not look away!!!  Please help me fight the good fight.  Let's join together to set the captives free.This is my radio interview about the making of my documentary, The New Abolitionists, with my good friend Laura Spaeth at BBOX Radio!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Metal Head is a <strong>crime/thriller short</strong> that is punctuated by a tight 80's thrash metal soundtrack. The story follows Raymond, whose task is to dispose of everyone else who made a deal with the devil and didn't hold up their end of the bargain. This includes the mysterious and dangerous Kal Monte, a notorious mob boss. Raymond and his reluctant partner, Zach, team up as an unlikely duo to enter Monte's den, only to find that a hell on earth awaits them.</p>
<p>This is one of our first major projects<strong> </strong>as a team.  We've sent a number of shorts to various festivals and now, we're ready to make something even grander.  The film will have an entirely original score which will be heavily inspired by thrash metal bands including Megadeth, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Pantera, and many more.</p>
<p>With a lot of sweat, tears, blood (and your help), we'll be able to make our dreams come true. We'll use every last dollar and work tirelessly to make something we are<strong> truly, truly passionate about.</strong> Plus, we have some great rewards to everyone who takes this journey with us! Whether it's $1, $1,000,000, or even just giving this Indiegogo the time of day, we already can't <strong>thank you</strong> enough. </p>
<h3>Who Are We? </h3>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>First, we'll get straight to what you need to know: what we need and where it's going. Below is the budget breakdown, for a total of <strong>$9000CAD. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503023766/pir8p5vt6yps8h6nlczu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A list of our perks are included to the right, including some unique perks such as <strong>the entire original soundtrack, an exclusive Backers Behind-the-Scenes film, </strong>and <strong>Thrash Metal-inspired clothing. </strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Metal Head is an opportunity to bring the sweet sweet sound of 80's thrash metal back into the limelight.  Your contributions will make it possible for us to stretch our creative freedom as far as we need it to. We will be able to rent better locations for longer, pay our crew for their hard and honest work (yeah that would be nice),  and enhance some of the VFX/SFX of the film. </p>
<p>With your help we hope to make a product that can go on to be a feature, this film serving as its own standalone origin story to a future installment.  This isn't our first rodeo, we have been at this for awhile now and only feel comfortable now asking for money because we know, without a shadow of a doubt, we will deliver on our film.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Metal Head is an ambitious project, some of the shots we are delivering are extremely technically difficult.  Additionally, the quality promised is quite high.</p>
<p>We are prepared for this however, we've brought on a team of professionals and have already done most of the leg work in due diligence to make delivering a fulfilling film to you, our backers, as amazing as it can be.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Make sure that when you pledge, you <strong>share</strong> the campaign so that more people can get in on the project. And that's all there is to it. Thanks so much! </p>

Plus, we have some great rewards to everyone who takes this journey with us! Whether it's $1, $1,000,000, or even just giving this Indiegogo the time of day, we already can't thank you enough. 
Who Are We? 
Gambit Entertainment is the awesome team behind Metal Head. Here's some of our major players for this short: 
Jordan Dawson (Writer, Co-Director, Lead Actor) has had a hand in all of Gambit's work. Jordan has experience in every role on set from pre- to post-production and spends as much time as he can perfecting the craft. As well as graduating from Queen's University Film, Jordan is a Transcoder at the Toronto-based film production company, Suneeva.  He is also endlessly determined and constantly improving. 

Ryan Randall (Director of Photography) is an Associate of the Canadian Society of Cinematographers and actively shoots commercials, documentaries, and media arts projects. Graduating from OCAD in 2002; Ryan is an educator, technician, father, and part-time farmer. He is constantly collaborating, frequently fixing things, and persistently problem solving. 

Angeli Pineda (Co-director) is an artist-of-all-trades. Recently hired as an incoming associate designer at Deloitte Digital, she enjoys spending the majority of her time practicing and studying visual arts, music, dance, acting, writing, and of course, film. Having graduated from Queen's University Film, Angeli loves nothing more than exercising her creativity and determination by bringing new ideas to life. 


What We Need & What You Get
First, we'll get straight to what you need to know: what we need and where it's going. Below is the budget breakdown, for a total of $9000CAD. 

A list of our perks are included to the right, including some unique perks such as the entire original soundtrack, an exclusive Backers Behind-the-Scenes film, and Thrash Metal-inspired clothing. 

The Impact
Metal Head is an opportunity to bring the sweet sweet sound of 80's thrash metal back into the limelight.  Your contributions will make it possible for us to stretch our creative freedom as far as we need it to. We will be able to rent better locations for longer, pay our crew for their hard and honest work (yeah that would be nice),  and enhance some of the VFX/SFX of the film. 
With your help we hope to make a product that can go on to be a feature, this film serving as its own standalone origin story to a future installment.  This isn't our first rodeo, we have been at this for awhile now and only feel comfortable now asking for money because we know, without a shadow of a doubt, we will deliver on our film.

Risks & Challenges
Metal Head is an ambitious project, some of the shots we are delivering are extremely technically difficult.  Additionally, the quality promised is quite high.
We are prepared for this however, we've brought on a team of professionals and have already done most of the leg work in due diligence to make delivering a fulfilling film to you, our backers, as amazing as it can be.

Other Ways You Can Help
Make sure that when you pledge, you share the campaign so that more people can get in on the project. And that's all there is to it. Thanks so much!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h4>Communication + LED + Heart</h4>
<p>I believe that the world continues to develop everyday, but for some reason I feel it's becoming harder to read people's emotions. Why is it harder to read people when the world is absolutely becoming more advanced? It's because people can easily lie about how they feel. However, even in this modern world where there's a large gap between what people feel and what they say, there's still a chance for you to get others to know you. ""Sharinka"" will help you to do it.</p>

We ordered dozens of types of LED and chose the brightest light that uses the least amount of power. Because the light flashes to the user's heart beat, the LED lasts longer than a device that continuously shines light, resulting in longer battery life. We are still working on the outer appearance and will update everyone frequently.</p>

<p><br/>Italiano più in basso</p>
<h3>The italian feature ""<strong>Three The Movie</strong>"" is what you would call a low-budget production, or better, ""no-budget"" production, as it <strong>did not secure private financing or public funding at all</strong>.</h3>
<p>As independent production company, we had to rely on our own strength, on the qualified support of Videe Ltd., based in Pordenone, which lent us equipment for the shooting and the ""moviola"", on the active help of many local companies, which provided free locations, costumes, catering services. Last but not least, regarding the availability of professionals, artists and crew members, who accepted to work for a payment not equal to their talent and abilities.</p>
<p><i>Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not [...]. Genius will not; [...]. Education will not [...]. Persistence and detemination alone are omnipotent.</i></p>
<p>Borrowing from Calvin Coolidge's phrase<i>, </i>we have talent (maybe!) but we have trusted in our persistence and determination.</p>
<p>So... the work is done!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Il lungometraggio italiano ""Three The Movie"" è quello che si chiama una produzione low budget, o meglio, “no budget”, dato che non ha ottenuto contributi economici pubblici né finanziamenti privati.</h3>
<p>Come casa di produzione indipendente, abbiamo dovuto contare sulle nostre (esigue) forze, sul sostegno qualificato della Videe di Pordenone, che ha prestato le attrezzature necessarie per le riprese e la “moviola”, sul supporto attivo di numerose aziende friulane che hanno messo a disposizione location, costumi, servizio di catering... infine, ma non ultima in ordine di importanza, la disponibilità di professionisti, artisti e tecnici che hanno percepito compensi non pari al proprio talento e alle proprie abilità.</p>
<p><i>Nulla al mondo può prendere il posto della perseveranza. Non il talento [...] Non il genio [...]. Non l’istruzione [...]. Solo la perseveranza e la determinazione sono onnipotenti.</i></p>
<p>Mutuando una frase di Calvin Coolidge, se pensavamo di avere talento (forse!), ciò su cui abbiamo confidato è stata la nostra tenacia e determinazione.</p>
<p>Così... il lavoro è compiuto!</p>

<h3>Brief Synopsis</h3>
<p>3 is everything in this movie. 3 and its multiples. Archaic, spiritual, transcendent numbers. 3, 6, 9. Carriers of wisdom that lead us to the heart of theological monotheisms. 3, the Christian Trinity. 6, the points of the Star of David, the Jewish Star. 9, the Enneagram, the ""face of God"" in Sufi traditions.</p>
<p>3 boys. 3 stories intertwined in a land, Friuli, which extends along a triple border... The reconstruction of the micro(?)universe of illegal immigrants in the North-East of Italy. The life, the longing to happiness, the equality of diversity. Predestination and moral choice?<br/>There are so many ways to see... (<i>There is no truth. There is only perception</i>  - Gustave Flaubert).</p>
<p>The plot leads to philosophical, visionary, surreal dimensions. It is a poetic disenchantment.</p>

<h2>Breve Sinossi</h2>
<p>3 è tutto in questo film. 3 e suoi multipli. Numeri arcaici, spirituali, trascendenti. 3, 6, 9. Vettori sapienzali che ci conducono al cuore teologico dei monoteismi. 3, la Trinità cristiana. 6, le punte della Stella di David, la Stella degli Ebrei. 9, il volto di Dio secondo la tradizione Sufi, per la cultura islamica.</p>
<p>Tre ragazzi. Tre storie s’intrecciano in una terra, il Friuli, che si estende lungo un triplice confine... La ricostruzione del micro(?)universo dell'immigrazione illegale nel Nord Est Italia. La vita, l'anelito alla felicità, l'uguaglianza delle diversità. Predestinazione o scelta morale? Ci sono tanti modi di vedere... (<i>Non c'è verità. C'è solo percezione</i> - Gustave Flaubert)</p>
<p>La trama sfocia in dimensioni filosofiche, visionarie, surreali. E' disincanto poetico.</p>

<p><i>Cinema makes its way through an amazing array of images during the opening of this film that celebrates human beings. It celebrates them on the stage of life, a concrete existence, both real and suffering, that is the theatre of secret and subtle events, proclaimed as a vibrant hymn to the spectacle of a timeless human comedy without place. [...] Angels and demons, shadows and lights, Faith and suspicion dance like elegant dreams and surreal transpositions in the evocative images of a delicate and generous film which favours the fresh air of soul searching and becomes a cinema that is silent and inquiring into the individual, the society that accepts him or her and the reality from which it is fed. ___ </i>Dario Carta, Cinefile.biz</p>

<p><i>Il cinema si fa subito spazio, nello splendido soffio di immagini in apertura di un film che celebra l’uomo. E lo celebra sul palcoscenico della vita, l’esistenza concreta, reale e sofferta che è teatro di vicende tanto sottili e segrete quanto proclamate nel vibrante inno di una Comèdie Humaine di ogni tempo e luogo. [...] Angeli e demoni, luci e ombre, Fede e sospetto danzano come sogni eleganti e trasposizioni surreali nelle suggestive immagini di un film delicato e generoso che privilegia il respiro aperto della ricerca interiore e si fa cinema silenzioso e indagatore sull'individuo, la società che lo accoglie e la realtà da cui è nutrito. ___ </i>Dario Carta – Cinefile.biz</p>

<h2>25 Reasons to support this movie</h2>
<p>1. It deals with social relevant subjects (immigration and cultural/religious conflicts);<br/>2. It deals with cultural, psychological and spiritual topics, typical of the Western world and a possible common ground between Middle East and the Western world;<br/>3. For the good script and a very carefully calibrated staging of a thought able to order events in an unusual, transversal and charming vision;<br/>4. To go beyond genre, and to contain all the possible areas for a movie (love, hate, friendship, conflicts, desires, questions about life and death, fear of the unknown, yearning for something);<br/>5. It covers profound topics lightly and light issues deeply;<br/>6. The story speaks to the viewer's heart but also to the viewer's brain<br/>7. Beginning with equal and antagonistic themes and concepts, it shows the equality of diversity, revealing the universality of human nature;<br/>8. It is about a reality which is shared by all humanity: the longing for happiness;<br/>9. It is a ""cry for freedom"": freedom of expression, creative freedom, freedom from the shackles of politics, freedom from constraints and moral or material debts to anyone, freedom of determination, moral, ethical and spiritual freedom...<br/>10. It conveys an implicit message of equality, peace and tolerance;<br/>11. It experiences an expressive language in both writing and installation, that rearranges time;<br/>12. It allows the viewer's active involvement, reflection and freedom to consider the events as they are told;<br/>13. The soundtrack, an original composition written for the film, makes the deepest harmonica vibrate;<br/>14. Music, images and sounds are part of a harmonious whole;<br/>15. The Movie and its music (the movie soundtrack composer, Roberto Salvalaio, is a real celebrity in the East and in other European countries such as Romania, Germany, Switzerland, Russia) have a bridging role between West and East;<br/>16. For the extreme novelty of some directorial solutions, praised by critics;<br/>17. For the absolute novelty in the history of cinema, highlighted by critics, of having put in relation the three monotheistic religions according to a fascinating vision;<br/>18. Because Udine, a fascinating city almost unknown to the world of cinema and one of the main character of the narration, becomes the symbolic location of a story of every place;<br/>19. The cinematographic production work (active collaboration between artists, technicians and various production sectors) is very clear;<br/>20. Because the set was an expression of the industriousness of Friulian people and multi-ethnic integration;<br/>21. For the assortment and the harmonious fusion of the cast;<br/>22. Original and strong characterization;<br/>23. It deals with inner and real angels and demons (and with those who have faced them...);<br/>24. Because this film, which did not get government grants, is courageous and different, and for this reason alone it should be supported;<br/>25. Because this film has the power to transport you somewhere else... in a single flutter!</p>
<h2>25 motivi per sostenere questo film</h2>
<p>1. Per l'attualità sociale dei temi trattati (l'immigrazione e i conflitti culturali e religiosi);<br/>2. Per l'attualità dei temi culturali, psicologici e spirituale, propri di questo tempo nel mondo Occidentale, e dei possibili punti di incontro col mondo orientale e medio-orientale;<br/>3. Per la solida sceneggiatura e la calibratissima messa in scena di un pensiero in grado di ordinare la storia in una visione inusuale, trasversale e affascinante;<br/>4. Per andare oltre il genere, e contenere tutti i temi possibili di un film (amore, odio, amicizia, conflitti, desiderio, interrogativi sulla vita e sulla morte, paura dell’ignoto, anelito a qualcosa);<br/>5. Perché tratta i temi profondi con leggerezza e con leggerezza i temi profondi;<br/>6. Perché le vicende narrate parlano alla mente e al cuore;<br/>7. Perché partendo da temi e concetti antagonisti e paritetici, racconta l’uguaglianza delle diversità, rivelando l’universale natura umana;<br/>8. Perché questa storia racconta realtà condivisa dall’intera umanità: l’anelito alla felicità;<br/>9. Perché questo film è un “grido di libertà”: libertà espressiva, libertà creativa, libertà dalle pastoie della politica, libertà dai vincoli e dai debiti morali o materiali verso chichessia, libertà di determinazione, libertà morale, etica e spirituale...;<br/>10. Per il messaggio implicito di uguaglianza, pace e tolleranza in esso contenuto;<br/>11. Per il linguaggio espressivo sperimentato, sia in scrittura che al montaggio, che ridisegna il tempo;<br/>12. Perché consente la partecipazione attiva del pubblico, la riflessione e la libertà rispettata di interrogarsi sui fatti rappresentati;<br/>13. Perché la musica, scritta appositamente, fa vibrare le armoniche più profonde;<br/>14. Perché musica, immagini e suoni un armonioso tutt’uno;<br/>15. Perché film e musica (l'autore della colonna sonora, Roberto Salvalaio, è un'autentica celebrità in Oriente e in altri paesi europei come Romania, Germania, Svizzera, Russia) sono ponte che collega Occidente e Oriente;<br/>16. Per l'estrema novità di alcune soluzioni registiche riconosciute anche dalla Critica;<br/>17. Per la novità assoluta nella storia del Cinema, messa in luce dalla critica, dell’aver messo in relazione i tre monoteismi secondo una visione affascinante;<br/>18. Perché Udine, pressoché sconosciuta al Cinema e attraente protagonista al pari dei personaggi, diventa luogo simbolo di una storia al contempo di ogni luogo;<br/>19. Perché nel film è evidente il lavoro di factory cinematografica (di fattiva collaborazione tra artisti, tecnici e dei diversi comparti di produzione tra loro);<br/>20. Perché il set è stato espressione della laboriosità friulana e di integrazione multi-etnica;<br/>21. Per l’assortimento e l’armoniosa fusione del cast;<br/>22. Per l'originalità e la forte caratterizzazione dei personaggi;<br/>23. Perché è una storia che parla di Angeli e Demoni, interiori e reali (e chi non li ha incontrati!);<br/>24. Perché questo film, che non ha ottenuto contributi pubblici, è un’opera coraggiosa e controcorrente, e anche solo per questo, andrebbe sostenuta;<br/>25. Perché questo film ha il potere di portarti altrove… in un battito d’ali!</p>

The italian feature ""Three The Movie"" is what you would call a low-budget production, or better, ""no-budget"" production, as it did not secure private financing or public funding at all.
As independent production company, we had to rely on our own strength, on the qualified support of Videe Ltd., based in Pordenone, which lent us equipment for the shooting and the ""moviola"", on the active help of many local companies, which provided free locations, costumes, catering services. Last but not least, regarding the availability of professionals, artists and crew members, who accepted to work for a payment not equal to their talent and abilities.
Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not [...]. Genius will not; [...]. Education will not [...]. Persistence and detemination alone are omnipotent.
Borrowing from Calvin Coolidge's phrase, we have talent (maybe!) but we have trusted in our persistence and determination.
So... the work is done!
 
 
Il lungometraggio italiano ""Three The Movie"" è quello che si chiama una produzione low budget, o meglio, “no budget”, dato che non ha ottenuto contributi economici pubblici né finanziamenti privati.
Come casa di produzione indipendente, abbiamo dovuto contare sulle nostre (esigue) forze, sul sostegno qualificato della Videe di Pordenone, che ha prestato le attrezzature necessarie per le riprese e la “moviola”, sul supporto attivo di numerose aziende friulane che hanno messo a disposizione location, costumi, servizio di catering... infine, ma non ultima in ordine di importanza, la disponibilità di professionisti, artisti e tecnici che hanno percepito compensi non pari al proprio talento e alle proprie abilità.
Nulla al mondo può prendere il posto della perseveranza. Non il talento [...] Non il genio [...]. Non l’istruzione [...]. Solo la perseveranza e la determinazione sono onnipotenti.
Mutuando una frase di Calvin Coolidge, se pensavamo di avere talento (forse!), ciò su cui abbiamo confidato è stata la nostra tenacia e determinazione.
Così... il lavoro è compiuto!


Brief Synopsis
3 is everything in this movie. 3 and its multiples. Archaic, spiritual, transcendent numbers. 3, 6, 9. Carriers of wisdom that lead us to the heart of theological monotheisms. 3, the Christian Trinity. 6, the points of the Star of David, the Jewish Star. 9, the Enneagram, the ""face of God"" in Sufi traditions.
3 boys. 3 stories intertwined in a land, Friuli, which extends along a triple border... The reconstruction of the micro(?)universe of illegal immigrants in the North-East of Italy. The life, the longing to happiness, the equality of diversity. Predestination and moral choice?There are so many ways to see... (There is no truth. There is only perception  - Gustave Flaubert).
The plot leads to philosophical, visionary, surreal dimensions. It is a poetic disenchantment.
 
Breve Sinossi
3 è tutto in questo film. 3 e suoi multipli. Numeri arcaici, spirituali, trascendenti. 3, 6, 9. Vettori sapienzali che ci conducono al cuore teologico dei monoteismi. 3, la Trinità cristiana. 6, le punte della Stella di David, la Stella degli Ebrei. 9, il volto di Dio secondo la tradizione Sufi, per la cultura islamica.
Tre ragazzi. Tre storie s’intrecciano in una terra, il Friuli, che si estende lungo un triplice confine... La ricostruzione del micro(?)universo dell'immigrazione illegale nel Nord Est Italia. La vita, l'anelito alla felicità, l'uguaglianza delle diversità. Predestinazione o scelta morale? Ci sono tanti modi di vedere... (Non c'è verità. C'è solo percezione - Gustave Flaubert)
La trama sfocia in dimensioni filosofiche, visionarie, surreali. E' disincanto poetico.


Cinema makes its way through an amazing array of images during the opening of this film that celebrates human beings. It celebrates them on the stage of life, a concrete existence, both real and suffering, that is the theatre of secret and subtle events, proclaimed as a vibrant hymn to the spectacle of a timeless human comedy without place. [...] Angels and demons, shadows and lights, Faith and suspicion dance like elegant dreams and surreal transpositions in the evocative images of a delicate and generous film which favours the fresh air of soul searching and becomes a cinema that is silent and inquiring into the individual, the society that accepts him or her and the reality from which it is fed. ___ Dario Carta, Cinefile.biz
For more information about Cast, Troupe, Awards and Official Selections, Press Reviews... read our Press Kit on Yumpu.
The Soundtrack of this film deserves special attention. It' s original and composed for an Synphonic Orchestra of 60 elements by the international renown conductor Roberto Salvalaio.
 
Il cinema si fa subito spazio, nello splendido soffio di immagini in apertura di un film che celebra l’uomo. E lo celebra sul palcoscenico della vita, l’esistenza concreta, reale e sofferta che è teatro di vicende tanto sottili e segrete quanto proclamate nel vibrante inno di una Comèdie Humaine di ogni tempo e luogo. [...] Angeli e demoni, luci e ombre, Fede e sospetto danzano come sogni eleganti e trasposizioni surreali nelle suggestive immagini di un film delicato e generoso che privilegia il respiro aperto della ricerca interiore e si fa cinema silenzioso e indagatore sull'individuo, la società che lo accoglie e la realtà da cui è nutrito. ___ Dario Carta – Cinefile.biz

25 Reasons to support this movie
1. It deals with social relevant subjects (immigration and cultural/religious conflicts);2. It deals with cultural, psychological and spiritual topics, typical of the Western world and a possible common ground between Middle East and the Western world;3. For the good script and a very carefully calibrated staging of a thought able to order events in an unusual, transversal and charming vision;4. To go beyond genre, and to contain all the possible areas for a movie (love, hate, friendship, conflicts, desires, questions about life and death, fear of the unknown, yearning for something);5. It covers profound topics lightly and light issues deeply;6. The story speaks to the viewer's heart but also to the viewer's brain7. Beginning with equal and antagonistic themes and concepts, it shows the equality of diversity, revealing the universality of human nature;8. It is about a reality which is shared by all humanity: the longing for happiness;9. It is a ""cry for freedom"": freedom of expression, creative freedom, freedom from the shackles of politics, freedom from constraints and moral or material debts to anyone, freedom of determination, moral, ethical and spiritual freedom...10. It conveys an implicit message of equality, peace and tolerance;11. It experiences an expressive language in both writing and installation, that rearranges time;12. It allows the viewer's active involvement, reflection and freedom to consider the events as they are told;13. The soundtrack, an original composition written for the film, makes the deepest harmonica vibrate;14. Music, images and sounds are part of a harmonious whole;15. The Movie and its music (the movie soundtrack composer, Roberto Salvalaio, is a real celebrity in the East and in other European countries such as Romania, Germany, Switzerland, Russia) have a bridging role between West and East;16. For the extreme novelty of some directorial solutions, praised by critics;17. For the absolute novelty in the history of cinema, highlighted by critics, of having put in relation the three monotheistic religions according to a fascinating vision;18. Because Udine, a fascinating city almost unknown to the world of cinema and one of the main character of the narration, becomes the symbolic location of a story of every place;19. The cinematographic production work (active collaboration between artists, technicians and various production sectors) is very clear;20. Because the set was an expression of the industriousness of Friulian people and multi-ethnic integration;21. For the assortment and the harmonious fusion of the cast;22. Original and strong characterization;23. It deals with inner and real angels and demons (and with those who have faced them...);24. Because this film, which did not get government grants, is courageous and different, and for this reason alone it should be supported;25. Because this film has the power to transport you somewhere else... in a single flutter!

<h3>Why hello there...</h3>
<p>My name is Antonio Harper and I am a current senior at Cleveland State University in my last semester of college.  Film has always been my life, from my earliest memory to my current projects I have always held a passion for film in my heart.  Starting at a young age with short stories and comics to now feature length films and award winning work I have done the best to expose myself to all things film to help better my work and knowledge on the subject.  By the time I was 14 I had already directed, written, acted and edited my own feature length 007 film, in high school my exposer grew from doing an anti-bully PSA's that was distributed throughout the district to winning my first ever film festival for Best In Show and Best Comedy at the iMagine Hathaway Brown Film Festival.  I had the opportunity to work on professional studios with Scenarios USA for their short ""Speechless"" and had that work put into the Cleveland International Film Festival.  Also in high school I was able to acquire an internship for my senior project at the Greater Cleveland Film Commission during the filming of Captain America: the Winter Solider and Draft Day to see what exactly happened on the business side of film making and how to increase the film industry in Cleveland.   From that point on I then looked to getting into film festivals, I volunteered at the Cleveland International Film Festival and started participating the Cleveland 48 Hour Film Festival the summer after graduating high school in 2013.  Starting there and the 4 summers to follow I would receive nominations every year for my short films entered into the festival from Audience Choice, Best Us of Prop and Line and Best Choreographed Fight to Best Male Actor in a Leading Role.</p>
<p> After graduating I decided to stay in Cleveland and attend Cleveland State University where starting my freshman year started CSU's very first film club called Oscar Production, made a full length action comedy film titled ""The Elite"", going into sophomore year I worked on a second film drama called ""Fine Line"", junior year I got creative and made a mockumentary web series on Youtube called ""Credit Hours"" which followed the daily lives of four college roommates and finally senior year I was able to (in my first semester) work on the Cavs intro video(s) for the 2016-2017 season, be hired on the Scenarios USA production of ""Split Persona"" and gained another internship with the Greater Cleveland Film Commission for college credit, which I was then hired on for the following semester as a part time employee.  Now I look to finish my last semester stronger than ever with this project.  With my final production class I look to do what no college student would ever think of doing...paying their classmates!  Its crazy I know but this production class is supposed to help give us insight of what real production is and the entire process that goes into it and so having the background I have I know that people get paid when they work on projects so it only seems right to do this for this class and those who are ""hired"" on as my cast and crew.  This funding would go to that as well as props, location permits, food and transportation need for production.  Each year that I have attended CSU I have made it my duty to one up myself in what I have done in previous years and this will be my crowing jewel at CSU.   My wish is to make this as real of a production that has ever been done by a student at CSU.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Some give and take now,</h3>
<p>So now we have reached the question of what do I get out of the funding and what do you get out of it?  We look to raise a maximum of $8000 with a minimum amount of $4000.  This may seem like a lot but I wish to utilize all the money in how a true Hollywood production would.  The money would go towards paying the actors a crew members, gaining location permits, food for the cast and crew, transportation expenses being gas and a rental car if needed, rental equipment, theater expenses for premiering the film and also some funds for entering the short into local and international film festivals.  The money would be used to the fullest extent not leaving a dime unused.  </p>
<p>The return you will gain depending on your level of contribution will give you on screen credit from Special Thanks to Executive Producers.  With the level of contribution you give you shall receive perks starting at a ""Thank You"" video from me the Director to T-shirts, signed poster by the cast, DVD copies of the film with a  blooper reel and even a original copy of the script.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How this effects you and us</h3>
<p>This project is made to boost film in Cleveland, I myself am looking to start a small independent film company called West 10G Productions in the heart of Downtown Cleveland.  This film will be the starting point for that dream.  I know all the raw talent that is heres and I want to expose it for everyone to see that they don't need to go to L.A or Atlanta to make it in the film industry but that they can make that dream happen right here.  I want to give those people hope and that is what I wish to start off with this project.  West 10G Productions will continue that dream with allowing college students the opportunity to create and work on film productions to further work their craft outside of school.  The company though will not just include college students but all film enthusiast from actors and directors to legal advisors and accountants.  We will look to help grow the film industry in Cleveland and it all starts with this project.</p>
<p>Now no production is ever perfect, there will always be obstacles and risk that go into making any film.  The first is rising enough money to do what it is that we want to do for this film to make it the best product in the end, so the first step is your help in helping us reach our goal.  Now after that the matter is in our hands and taking the resources that you have given us to make this film and we will execute this perfectly with the best quality outcome and it is because I as a filmmaker have always worked with next to nothing with my productions and yet they all have been nominated for some type of award or recognition, my anti-bully PSA was acclaimed throughout my high school district, I won my first ever film festival with a comedy called ""Larry"" for both Best in Show and Best Comedy at the iMagine Film Festival and every year that I entered the Cleveland 48 Hour Film Festival starting in 2013 I was nominated for multiple awards ""66 Days"" (2013) was the debut for the film festival, ""Childs Play"" (2014) was nominated for Audience Choice and Best Choreographed Fight, ""The Orientation"" (2015) was nominated for Best Use of Prop and Audience Choice and ""Age of Chains"" (2016) I was nominated for Best Male Actor in a Leading Role.  All of those short films I had no finances for and was still able to make art work to the fullest potential.  So in short I have been able to make something out of nothing and so you and I both are excited to see what I can do with a little fundraising in my corner.</p>
<p>Nowadays money isn't the only way to help, word of mouth is just as resourceful.  So if you're unable to give even the smallest of contribution thats okay, share our link, post it on your social media and help us get the word out.  Anything you do can help and will help us get that much closer to our goal and from there help jumpstart an even bigger project for the city of Cleveland.  We hope that we have your support for ""The Jackpot"" and hope you will join us on this wild ride of the most exciting family outing ever.</p>

<p><strong>THE ESTONYANS</strong>, my first feature film, well ours. Just because I couldn't do it without amazing people working with me. But I have to say, it is really exciting to finally share this amazing story with you. </p>
<p>Hello I'm Miguel de Oliveira, I'm a passionate filmmaker that, as you probably already know, want to do my first film. I'm sharing here with you all the other short films I've done. If you go to our website: <strong><a href=""http://www.momifilms.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.momifilms.com</a></strong>, you can watch our films for free. </p>
<p>It has been an amazing journey so far, so we need to take it to the next level: Make this film Happen. <strong>THE ESTONYANS.</strong></p>
<p>We're asking for your <strong>donation</strong>, bur also if you <strong>know someone</strong> that has an apartment, a coffee shop, a restaurant, some interesting place, we'd love to hear about it.</p>
<p>I hope we can take this journey together, make things possible, make things happen, make art happen. Let's fill the world with possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you.</strong></p>
<p>Miguel de Oliveira</p>
<p><strong>THE STORY:</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490325060/ndkj9w15nj7rik2gddgb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Peter, Mary, Fred, Carol and Alice.</strong> This is a story about 5 people in crisis with the modern world. One thing they all know. They're not happy. Something is missing but they don't know what it is. They all live in New York, the city of inspiration, where everything is possible, but tough and challenging. They all have the ambition to to be amazing, do awesome things, but something is missing in their lives. They need to feel something new, feel again what is to do something for the first time. First kiss, a first emotion, see and experience new things. But they feel stuck, like a fish in an aquarium. In their search for happiness their lives connect and something magical comes out of that.</p>
<p>In a rollercoaster of emotions we'll go deep into their lives, we'll laugh together, we'll suffer together, but there is always the promise of hope, and that if you keep trying, don't give up, things we'll get better. </p>
<p>While they search for the meaning of their lives, they dream about an imaginary place, where happiness is possible, here in New York.</p>

</div></div>","THE ESTONYANS, my first feature film, well ours. Just because I couldn't do it without amazing people working with me. But I have to say, it is really exciting to finally share this amazing story with you.

Miguel de Oliveira
THE STORY:

Peter, Mary, Fred, Carol and Alice. This is a story about 5 people in crisis with the modern world. One thing they all know. They're not happy. Something is missing but they don't know what it is. They all live in New York, the city of inspiration, where everything is possible, but tough and challenging. They all have the ambition to to be amazing, do awesome things, but something is missing in their lives. They need to feel something new, feel again what is to do something for the first time. First kiss, a first emotion, see and experience new things. But they feel stuck, like a fish in an aquarium. In their search for happiness their lives connect and something magical comes out of that.
In a rollercoaster of emotions we'll go deep into their lives, we'll laugh together, we'll suffer together, but there is always the promise of hope, and that if you keep trying, don't give up, things we'll get better. 
While they search for the meaning of their lives, they dream about an imaginary place, where happiness is possible, here in New York.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As you can imagine, making a film is never cheap! No matter if it is a Hollywood Blockbuster, or a 10 minute short dark comedy like Misofrtune. All of us working on this film are current students at QUT in Brisbane so to us $5000 is quite a big ask... this is where you come in. We are hoping the majority of our funds to go towards our art department (costumes and props) to make this film look amazing! As everyone working on this film will be generously volunteering their time for free we will need to provide on set meals and accommodation. </p>
<p>Don't worry, your generous donations will not go unnoticed! With every donation, you will receive an invitation to our exclusive, invite-only pre-production party where there will be drinks, music and prizes to give away! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we reach our goal and manage to create this film we would be forever grateful! Misfortune has been a passion project for us for over a year and we would do anything to be able to see it created to the best quality it could be, not only for us but for our audiences too.

<p>Set in the context of a communally sensitive early 1993, Prasun Chatterjee’s film Dharmik (The Religious) has two distinct trajectories. In the first trajectory, he takes us through the nuances of an unconditional friendship between two kids of two different religious communities and how it grows stronger against all odds. </p>

<p>In the second half, when the friendship is hit with an irreparable tragedy, we experience the transformation of a relationship between two individuals into a larger human truth.</p>

<p>Prasun started his theatre career in 2010 and was associated with renowned thespian Sohag Sen’s Ensemble. He acted in major roles in Ensemble’s 2011 production ‘Lal Baksho’ and delivered critically acclaimed performances for two and a half years.</p>
<p>He also acted in Ranjan Ghosh’s   2014 feature film ‘<i>Hridmajhare</i>’ in the role of a promising painter.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Peter Slucock and I am the writer and creator of a brand new story called, ""The Seeing"". I have been writing for over 30 years, mainly short stories, that have appeared in various magazines and newspapers. I have also written, produced and directed 6 new plays and two musicals raising over £10,000 for various Cancer related charities.</p>
<p>The Seeing represents my first ""commercial"" venture. I have developed the idea over a period of 4 years and now feel ready to be able to pitch the premise to the various t.v and broadcasting ""giants"".</p>
<p>This campaign is to raise money to produce a fully funded ""sizzle reel"" to be the corner stone of our pitch. In order to fully highlight the show's potential we have experienced film makers and actors as well as quality post production services involving some CGI skills. They all believe in the project and have discounted for their services, but they need to eat</p>
<p>We are asking that if everyone that sees this campaign donates £5 then we are confident we will reach our target. Our dream is to get our show out to the widest audience possible. We have worked so hard for this, now all we need is a little help from you guys......PLEASE </p>
<p>We know that this is only one of many challenges we face. After this we still need to successfully pitch the completed treatment and that is by no means a ""given"".  We can only be confident in what we know and that is we have a quality product that we are passionate about.</p>

How do they bring their best selves in New York City!?<br/><br/>We want to document and share stories / advice on self love, in turn kick starting a movement, so we can all Pure Love Ourselves!

To have an overinflated opinion of oneself. This summer, 2 of us Glasgow Girls Club members are heading back to NYC to find out all we can about self-love in the Big Apple! We will interview native New Yorkers and expat Scots to discover what they think when they hear the phrase “You pure love yourself”. We want to find out about their journeys to self-love – the highs and the lows. How do they bring their best selves in New York City!?We want to document and share stories / advice on self love, in turn kick starting a movement, so we can all Pure Love Ourselves! This is a film. This is a movement. By us. For you. A FILM. A MOVEMENT. INSPIRING SELF LOVE & HARMONYWho? We are Toni (17) and Alex (19) of the Glasgow Girls ClubWhat? Supported by staff, we are making a short documentary interviewing people of myriad backgrounds and experiencesWhere? New York CityWhen? July, 2017How? Credit to YOU: We will be including your questions; you are the catalysts of this movement!Yeah, we know we have a lot of work to do to inspire everyone in the world to Pure Love Themselves... But if we collect 10 stories this summer (guaranteed with your help!), and each interviewee goes home and interviews 10 more and those 10 interview another 10 and on it goes, I think we could safely say that a movement is underway!!Our big vision is that this documentary can be used as a public health resource and educational tool within schools and beyond to help raise awareness and tackle stigma around mental health, and to promote wellbeing and self-care.MEET THE FILMMAKERSWe are 2 young people from Royston and Possil Park—2 neighbourhoods of Glasgow that are usually depicted as some of Glasgow's ""roughest"" or most ""economically disadvantaged."" The good news is that our past-times include defying the odds and showing the world that anything is possible! Hurray to that!!Since joining Girls Club, we have discovered that we share a huge passion for Film Making and Community Activism. Now, supported by Girls Club staff and resources, we want to share these passions with our first visit to New York, with the world and with you, through this film to show the world, that when you have a purpose, you can move mountains!When we started to think about the ‘well kent’ sarcastic Scottish phrase“You Pure Love Yourself”, and how it could have such an opposite meaning outside of Scotland, we thought Wouldn’t you like to know - what would happen if we all started to Pure Love Ourselves?!We would too!! Imagine that!? A world where self-love triumphs over fear, self-doubt and envy!Well, we figured, as a wise person once said – “Be the change you wish to see in the world”. It starts with you and me! Loving ourselves and sharing how we do that, to encourage others to love themselves! Creating a culture of caring about our communities is the only thing that can transform the world.And what better place to start than NYC – the city of dreams--where there’s NOTHING you can’t do? Don’t worry we know that only one single documentary won’t realistically inspire the whole world to love itself.But what we can do is make a film [If we can make it there… you know the rest] that becomes the first step in an incredible, movement to inspire others to record and share their own stories and top tips for self-love. #pureloveyourself #pureloveyourselfieStarting with our social media campaign and this film, Pure Love Yourself will launch a legacy, a movement to inspire a revolution in self-love across the globe.  FUNNY (AFFIRMING, INSPIRING, GLORIOUS, AWESOME) YOU SHOULD ASK - AND YOU SHOULD!Because, in our usual format, this documentary film project is all about collaboration and co-creation, we want to offer as much access as possible to people—all ages, across genders, cities, languages— on both sides of the camera.We want to hear from you! Everyone who donates at least £5 will be credited in the film (note: a film credit is usually only for the posh, pricey rewards), so what a special gift. Everyone who donates at least £15 gets to submit a question for consideration.So consider yourself our co-director, co-reporter, co-producer and co-creator of this impact documentary. And we expect great things from our collaborators ; ) so start thinking up some original Pure Love questions for the people of New York, like:
What do you think when you hear the phrase “you pure love yourself”?
Do you think there is a link between beauty and self-love?
What does beauty mean to you?
A time that you loved yourself the most?
Tell us about a time that you found it harder to love yourself? And how did you overcome?
How would the world be if every one knew their true value?

<h3>REVELATION, Dawn of Global Government</h3>
<p>Chuck ( director ) and Anita Untersee ( producer ) worked for over twenty years in the film business while in LA. As Christians, we felt it critical in the dark days of looming world government to be <i>""watchmen on the wall""</i> and illustrate through<strong> REVELATION</strong> the issues at hand which will destroy The Republic, while creating a <i>""Hunger Games""</i> like environment for those who remain. </p>
<p>With a theatrical test release in Houston April 15 we were seventh in the nation for opening weekend box office. Through eight other national theatrical screenings we quickly found <strong>REVELATION</strong> moves people and can change hearts and minds so that they might become ""Paul Reveres"" in this challenge to a New World Order.</p>
<p>We now are releasing the film nationally through the theatrical distribution system known as Tugg which was established for independent film releases.</p>
<p>Please see our web site:  <strong><a href=""http://revelationthemovie.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://revelationthemovie.info</a></strong>   and go to the TICKETS page. This allows you to book a local screening in your town anywhere in America, or, you can buy DVDs through our site on Amazon. </p>
<p>We hope to create a movement which can enlighten those countless people who know nothing of those who would create a global prison planet. Your contribution can help defray the huge costs involved in releasing and promoting this film. This film which in fact is not a film...but a cause.</p>
<p>We have set a goal of $100,000 which allows us to build the grass roots awareness on social media and through patriot advertising such as<strong> <a href=""http://infowars.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://infowars.com</a></strong>. Should we not reach the entire goal, still we will apply what there is to continuing to promote and release the film, </p>
<p>Our issues have a long shelf life beyond the election, however, pre election momentum can help us jump start the vast interest which is potentially there for us. </p>
<p>Each of us can make a difference by becoming aware of the dire urgency and threat. Banding together we can, as American patriots and Christians, find a national voice and change the direction of those who would destroy our sovereignty, liberty and faith.</p>
<p>We have met many challenges and risks were high throughout our five year odyessy in producing this film. We drove thousands of miles from Maine to California and Montana to Texas, filming some forty rock stars of the patriot movement. Always, as doors closed others would open. It has been an long and arduous journey, but filled with great reward in now seeing it come to fruition on the big screen. </p>
<p>Please contribute to <strong>REVELATION, Dawn of Global Government</strong> in this final push of promotion and advertising.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Matt is a young musician in a band on the verge of breaking up as his singer Julia prepares to move across the country to pursue her career aspirations. Instead of accepting defeat and moving on, Matt hatches a last-ditch scheme to keep her in the band. The plan: buy Julia a case of her favorite beer for her going away party hoping she'll drop everything and stay. The only problem is that Matt is underage, so he must enlist the help of a stranger to buy the beer for him. This stranger ends up being Bert, an oddball, washed-up musician that seeks to help out Matt. However, Bert quickly begins to ruin Matt’s plans trying to relive his glory days by hanging out with Matt’s band.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Director's Note</h3>
<p>Hey everyone, my name’s Patrick! I’m a graduating senior studying Mass Media Arts at the University of Georgia. I’ve been making fun videos ever since I figured out how to hit record and upload to YouTube ten years ago when I was in middle-school. Since I’ve been at UGA though, I think (or at least hope) my filmmaking skills have drastically improved after working on a number of my friends’ short films. This will be my first project over a minute long that I’ve written and directed, and boy am I excited to tell this story.</p>
<p><br/>The recurring theme of Hey Mister centers on the each of the characters’ unique ways of handling adulthood in their relation to music. While having fun making movies and music as a kid, I slowly grew anxious thinking I’d need to give them up in pursuit of a safer and more conservative career path. While I luckily have a great support system that keeps me confident about my path, some of my peers aren’t so lucky, being told to “grow up and get a real job.” My goal is to tell that the transition to independent adulthood isn't always smooth for everyone, and you don't need to abandon doing what you love in exchange for it . Being both a filmmaker and a musician, I’m looking forward to telling a story of a young creative refusing to let go of the outlet he loves, but still learning to “grow up” in the meantime.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>A wise man once told me that nothing is ever free, and neither is making a movie. Even though the University of Georgia gives us access to some equipment, we will still need to raise money for certain camera and lens rentals. Our crew consists of a group of students volunteering their time for free, so we got to keep them fed on more than just ramen and their dreams of stardom. And your help won't go unnoticed, as you'll receive a plethora of perks based on your donation.</p>

<h3>Immersed</h3>
<p>A groundbreaking approach to filmmaking that will create an extreme emotional connection between the story and the viewer.<i> ""Taste and see that the Lord is good!""~Psalms 34:8</i></p>
<div style=""color:#202020;""><p><i><strong>“This can be one of the most impactful ministry tools created in our generation. Please prayerfully consider contributing to it and sharing it with your friends.”<br/>~Herman DeBoard</strong></i></p></div>
<p>Imagine if you were there...in the upper room during the last supper. Or if you were standing on the shores watching as Jesus fed the 5000. Or what if you were standing in Garden of Eden as Eve takes her first bite of the forbidden fruit. And what if you could watch as the stone rolls away revealing the empty tomb announcing that the King of Kings has risen?<br/><strong>This groundbreaking virtual reality project will take you there. </strong><br/><u>But we need your help!</u></p>
<div style=""color:#0000FF;""><p>""For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart."" Hebrews 4:12</p></div>
<p><i>Immersed will be a series of short films using Virtual Reality specially designed to immerse the viewer into the stories of the Holy Bible. </i></p>
<p>Using Virtual Reality Glasses, users will be immersed in everything taking place because they will be able to “Look Around” in 180HD as if they were actually in the movie.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508343708/fnaxtkkzpkmjkrwgml5e.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This will not be a computer generated traditional VR film!<br/>We will be shooting live footage of actors, acting out the stories directly from the Bible itself.<br/>The VR Goggles will allow you a 180-degree view left to right and top to bottom, so you can physically look around as the film plays out (as if you were actually there).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507921009/zzsxl3csa5ushxj6urkw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The first 7 short films are slated to be:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Mary Magdalene washing the feet of Jesus with oils,</li>
<li>In the Garden the night before the crucifixion,</li>
<li>In the upper room during the last supper,</li>
<li>The Original Sin in the Garden of Eden,</li>
<li>Jesus washing the feet of the Disciples,</li>
<li>Jesus heals the blind man,</li>
<li>At the tomb shortly after the stone is rolled away.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note: Our goal is to create a library of short films that chronicle the Old and New Testaments. These first 7 short films listed here will get us started down that path.</strong></p>

A groundbreaking approach to filmmaking that will create an extreme emotional connection between the story and the viewer. ""Taste and see that the Lord is good!""~Psalms 34:8
“This can be one of the most impactful ministry tools created in our generation. Please prayerfully consider contributing to it and sharing it with your friends.”~Herman DeBoard
Imagine if you were there...in the upper room during the last supper. Or if you were standing on the shores watching as Jesus fed the 5000. Or what if you were standing in Garden of Eden as Eve takes her first bite of the forbidden fruit. And what if you could watch as the stone rolls away revealing the empty tomb announcing that the King of Kings has risen?This groundbreaking virtual reality project will take you there. But we need your help!
""For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart."" Hebrews 4:12
Immersed will be a series of short films using Virtual Reality specially designed to immerse the viewer into the stories of the Holy Bible. 
Using Virtual Reality Glasses, users will be immersed in everything taking place because they will be able to “Look Around” in 180HD as if they were actually in the movie.

This will not be a computer generated traditional VR film!We will be shooting live footage of actors, acting out the stories directly from the Bible itself.The VR Goggles will allow you a 180-degree view left to right and top to bottom, so you can physically look around as the film plays out (as if you were actually there).

The first 7 short films are slated to be:

Mary Magdalene washing the feet of Jesus with oils,
In the Garden the night before the crucifixion,
In the upper room during the last supper,
The Original Sin in the Garden of Eden,
Jesus washing the feet of the Disciples,
Jesus heals the blind man,
At the tomb shortly after the stone is rolled away.

Note: Our goal is to create a library of short films that chronicle the Old and New Testaments. These first 7 short films listed here will get us started down that path.
Whether you are a mature Christian, a new believer or are curious about who Christ is, this project is meant to deepen your experience and relationship with Jesus.
And the best part is, you can take it with you on your travels and share it with anyone you want, right from your mobile phone and a portable headset.

These are issues that affect Americans all over the country, and we aim to elevate the dialogue surrounding these ideas. As of 2015,<strong> 20.5 million</strong> Americans 12 years or older have had a substance disorder involving <strong>opioids</strong>, and <strong>591,000</strong> had a substance use disorder involving <strong>heroin</strong>. There were <strong>12,990</strong> <strong>overdose deaths</strong> related to heroin in 2015. Most users become addicted to opioids from painkillers that are prescribed by doctors, and because of the complexity of this issue, it is difficult for legislators to find appropriate solutions to this problem. In 2017, President Trump declared the opioid epidemic a <strong>public health emergency</strong>. It is in the midst of this perplexing <strong>epidemic</strong> that Seahorse takes place. In Seahorse, we allow our audience to watch the story of just one abuser unfold in the sea of millions. While Emily’s story is fictional, it is based off of issues that addicts experience every day. We hope that Emily’s story will shed light on this epidemic and push audiences to call for further regulation and recovery services for individuals suffering from this problem.</p><p><strong>DISTRIBUTION</strong></p><p>The domestic theatrical release is the single most important event in determining the the future revenue stream of a motion picture. For this reason, Seahorse will place the utmost importance on submitting to reputable <strong>film festivals</strong> that will establish the most audience awareness for the film. With this awareness built up from film festivals, we will seek a <strong>North American theatrical distributor</strong> whose marketing plan and release strategy will launch the film into the mainstream audience. Two of the most important factors influencing a distributor's decision to acquire a film is the exploitability of genre or market segment and the originality of the story. Seahorse meets this criteria. In addition, the ability to market the film in such a way that emphasizes addiction and recovery gives distributors an easy marketing appeal. Distributors will not have a difficult time finding an audience for this film.</p><p><strong>FUNDING</strong></p><p>Here is where <strong>YOU</strong> can help!

<p>My name is Nicole Williams. I am starting this fundraiser to ask if you would be willing to support my efforts to create a documentary on a full hair sourcing trip in Cambodia. This will help bring awareness to how we can use beauty as a service in other countries.</p>
<p>What simply started as a love for beauty quickly turned in a business model that help address the needs of economic opportunities for the women who sell and manufacture hair extensions. Traveling overseas to source hair turned out to be some of the most life changing experiences. Im never ready to process half of what I see. Furthermore it is very difficult to capture much behind my personal lens. Most times I'm left with a few photos that doesn't capture the full adventure. </p>
<p>Being hands on from sourcing, collecting, sanitation, manufacturing and distribution is something to be proud of though the work is far from easy. Day and night on the back of motorbikes, traveling to the countryside looking for donors to pay for their tresses. Sleeping in hammocks in the safest place we can find. Taking malaria pills daily to prevent contracting the disease. Seeing children the same age as my children without diapers, clean water,and bet yet shelter. My purpose was birthed, and I've committed myself to cultivating opportunities for self, family, and our global community. </p>
<p>Helping with this documentary is one of the first steps to bring awareness to ways to use beauty to help end social problems both internationally and in the US.</p>
<p>This is my first fundraising attempt in efforts to making this goal a reality. I'm starting this campaign off with 10k for travel, equipment, director, and videographer. I plan to stay for 2 weeks documenting life behind hair. For everyone who participates, I will personally select you a gift from Cambodia.</p>
<p> </p>

Day and night on the back of motorbikes, traveling to the countryside looking for donors to pay for their tresses. Sleeping in hammocks in the safest place we can find. Taking malaria pills daily to prevent contracting the disease. Seeing children the same age as my children without diapers, clean water,and bet yet shelter. My purpose was birthed, and I've committed myself to cultivating opportunities for self, family, and our global community. 
Helping with this documentary is one of the first steps to bring awareness to ways to use beauty to help end social problems both internationally and in the US.
This is my first fundraising attempt in efforts to making this goal a reality. I'm starting this campaign off with 10k for travel, equipment, director, and videographer. I plan to stay for 2 weeks documenting life behind hair. For everyone who participates, I will personally select you a gift from Cambodia.

<h3>This Film and Us</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>About six years ago I was sitting in the audience at my first DragonCon. The panelist mentioned how much he appreciated the fandom on twitter. I started following a lot of people and the next year when I went back to DragonCon I was meeting a few of those people for the first time in real life. Meeting people in person that you have talked to every day is a weird experience that is hard to describe. It is wonderful and amazing, but also awkward all at once. Those friends are the ones that encouraged me to apply to grad school and pursue film. They have supported me through so much in the last few years and become like family. The stories that exist about people you meet on the internet have not reflected my experience.  I want to create a story that celebrates what the internet can do in it’s best moments.</li>
<li>In the journey of bringing this film to life, I met one of my internet friends for the first time while she was auditioning for a role in this film. After casting her (because she is an amazing actress) I was talking to her about some of the things I was struggling with to bring the film to life. I still didn't have a producer and I needed help. She is a producer and has a small production company that she runs with her husband. I immediately realized how dumb I had been for not asking her sooner to help me produce this film. What a perfect representation of WHY I am making this film in the first place! The friendships I have made on the internet have helped me and given me so much and I want to make something that represents that love. </li>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Imagine going to a movie theather or sit in front of your screen at home and whatch the Gospel of Mark as an animation movie with the same visual level of a Disney or Dreamworks movie? </p>
<p>We have been, and will continue using animation artists that have worked on Oscar winning productions to make sure we get a visually state of the art film. Further, it's verse by verse, so we don't emphasize certain parts whilst toning down others. </p>
<p>- But to make it happen, we need your help!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></strong></p>
<p>We need 300.000USD to make a standalone short movie. This will also function as a pilot to engage even larger investors for a full feature animation film of the whole Gospel of Mark. Word by Word / Verse by verse.</p>
<p>A breakdown of the funding will look something like this:</p>
<p>- 7-10% goes to fees to Indiegogo, Visa, Mastercard etc</p>
<p>- 4-6% will be spent on legal aspects; rights, consultancy etc.</p>
<p>- 10% Will be spent on music and voice recording*</p>
<p>The rest will go directly into paing the CG/Animation artists. No fancy salaries or fees to executive producers and so on. </p>
<p>*The voices will be a combination of actors and known profiled Christian leaders/artists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a thank you for your support, we have made some perks we hope you will enjoy. Please check them out!</p>
<p>It is a pretty large amount we're asking for, but we think the most important person in history deserves to be presented in a film with a high focus on visual animation quality and not look like something made on a computer 20 years ago. If we do not reach the entire amount we are asking for, see under the heading “What if we don’t manage to raise the amount?” Further down on this page.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>The Challenge and the Impact</strong></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reading in general is going down in most countries. And even though a lot of people have the bible, they dont read it. It’s more or less laying on a shelf, collecting dust. </p>
<p>Globally, at least 750 million youth and adults still cannot read and write and 250 million children are failing to acquire basic literacy skills. So, even if they were handed a bible, they would not be able to read it. That’s why we aim to present the gospel in a medium and form that people will engage in and hopefully encourage to further reading. We can’t just print the bible or put it in an app when hundreds of millions can’t or won’t read. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>What is so unique with this production?</strong></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A Disney or Dreamworks animation easily cost everything from 100 to 200 million dollars. Obviously an impossible amount to raise. Even though are quality will be very close,  this production will only cost a fraction of that. There are many reasons for that, but some of the most obvious are:</p>
<p>- We’re not paying Hollywood actors millions of dollars.</p>
<p>- It’s a much smaller team (Big animation films usually have hundreds working on it)</p>
<p>- We will be using software that makes the animation process much more effective to do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the teaser presented here (check out the video on top of page), we have used animation studios and talents who have worked on Oscar and other award winning and nominated films and shows, like Life of Pi, The Golden Compass, Game of Thrones, Black Panther and several projects for Disney and Fox and other major studios.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The idea is to make it so visually engaging that a kid would want to see it just as much as any other animation film. And of course, churches could use it in Sunday school class or in youth groups. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just as important, we are aiming at dubbing this production to as many languages as possible. Whe have already teamed up with a missions organzation that broadcast in over 60 countries. And we are constantly working on partnering with more. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Has this been done before?</strong></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There has been done animation or cartoons based on events from the gospel but not like this. Both in terms of the visual level, but also that  it will be done word by word / Verse by verse.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this way, it won’t be to conservative or to liberal. Or that we are focusing on some parts of the gospel and the story of Jesus, and toning down others, or introducing fictional characters, scenes and additional dialogue.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But to pull this off, we need your help. The major film studios won’t do it. Which is actually very understandable. They are targeting a broad audience, and therefore can’t and will not produce a version of the gospel unless it is somewhat fictional and with additional characters and scenes. We know this, because we have actually been in touch with some of the executives of major studios. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>What if we don’t manage to raise the amount?</strong></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we don’t manage to raise the amount, we’ll continue contacting investors and supporters tirelessly, making it chapter by chapter until whe have all 16 of them.  - Another cool thing is that if we manage to make a whole movie, we have already made a lot of the environments and characters in an extensive 3D library, making the road shorter to possibly do the other gospels as well somewhere down the road. So what you are giving here, might actually realize more films in the future. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Again, it is a lot of money?</strong></u></p>
<p>Honestly I don’t like presenting myself as I have done on the video here. But I believe in the cause, and that cause is more important than my comfort zone.  Asking for other peoples money, is also something I'm not to comfortable with, especially if I don’t give into it myself. That would only make me a salesman for a random product I’m told to sell. For this project, besides having used most of my time the last several months on this project without getting paid,(which I’ll also continue to do for months to come), I’ve also spent close to 80.000 dollars of my own money on it. So this is something I’m really passionate about and therefore hope you will join in and perhaps be part of some movie history.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></u></p>
<p>So again, please help us! It will be impossible to pull this of without your help. Even if it is just for a dollar it helps, and if you don’t have a dollar, sharing this Indiegogo campain on social media so perhaps some of your friends will consider supporting also helps a lot. </p>
<p>Thank you for taking your time to read this presentation and watch the presentation video, and God bless. </p>

Imagine going to a movie theather or sit in front of your screen at home and whatch the Gospel of Mark as an animation movie with the same visual level of a Disney or Dreamworks movie? 
We have been, and will continue using animation artists that have worked on Oscar winning productions to make sure we get a visually state of the art film. Further, it's verse by verse, so we don't emphasize certain parts whilst toning down others. 
- But to make it happen, we need your help!
 

What We Need & What You Get
We need 300.000USD to make a standalone short movie. This will also function as a pilot to engage even larger investors for a full feature animation film of the whole Gospel of Mark. Word by Word / Verse by verse.
A breakdown of the funding will look something like this:
- 7-10% goes to fees to Indiegogo, Visa, Mastercard etc
- 4-6% will be spent on legal aspects; rights, consultancy etc.
- 10% Will be spent on music and voice recording*
The rest will go directly into paing the CG/Animation artists. No fancy salaries or fees to executive producers and so on. 
*The voices will be a combination of actors and known profiled Christian leaders/artists.
 
As a thank you for your support, we have made some perks we hope you will enjoy. Please check them out!
It is a pretty large amount we're asking for, but we think the most important person in history deserves to be presented in a film with a high focus on visual animation quality and not look like something made on a computer 20 years ago. If we do not reach the entire amount we are asking for, see under the heading “What if we don’t manage to raise the amount?” Further down on this page.
 
The Challenge and the Impact
 
Reading in general is going down in most countries. And even though a lot of people have the bible, they dont read it. It’s more or less laying on a shelf, collecting dust. 
Globally, at least 750 million youth and adults still cannot read and write and 250 million children are failing to acquire basic literacy skills. So, even if they were handed a bible, they would not be able to read it. That’s why we aim to present the gospel in a medium and form that people will engage in and hopefully encourage to further reading. We can’t just print the bible or put it in an app when hundreds of millions can’t or won’t read. 
 
What is so unique with this production?
 
A Disney or Dreamworks animation easily cost everything from 100 to 200 million dollars. Obviously an impossible amount to raise. Even though are quality will be very close,  this production will only cost a fraction of that. There are many reasons for that, but some of the most obvious are:
- We’re not paying Hollywood actors millions of dollars.
- It’s a much smaller team (Big animation films usually have hundreds working on it)
- We will be using software that makes the animation process much more effective to do.
 
On the teaser presented here (check out the video on top of page), we have used animation studios and talents who have worked on Oscar and other award winning and nominated films and shows, like Life of Pi, The Golden Compass, Game of Thrones, Black Panther and several projects for Disney and Fox and other major studios.
 
The idea is to make it so visually engaging that a kid would want to see it just as much as any other animation film. And of course, churches could use it in Sunday school class or in youth groups. 
 
 
Just as important, we are aiming at dubbing this production to as many languages as possible. Whe have already teamed up with a missions organzation that broadcast in over 60 countries. And we are constantly working on partnering with more. 
 
 
Has this been done before?
 
There has been done animation or cartoons based on events from the gospel but not like this. Both in terms of the visual level, but also that  it will be done word by word / Verse by verse.
 
In this way, it won’t be to conservative or to liberal. Or that we are focusing on some parts of the gospel and the story of Jesus, and toning down others, or introducing fictional characters, scenes and additional dialogue.  
 
But to pull this off, we need your help. The major film studios won’t do it. Which is actually very understandable. They are targeting a broad audience, and therefore can’t and will not produce a version of the gospel unless it is somewhat fictional and with additional characters and scenes. We know this, because we have actually been in touch with some of the executives of major studios. 
 
What if we don’t manage to raise the amount?
 
If we don’t manage to raise the amount, we’ll continue contacting investors and supporters tirelessly, making it chapter by chapter until whe have all 16 of them.  - Another cool thing is that if we manage to make a whole movie, we have already made a lot of the environments and characters in an extensive 3D library, making the road shorter to possibly do the other gospels as well somewhere down the road. So what you are giving here, might actually realize more films in the future. 
 
Again, it is a lot of money?
Honestly I don’t like presenting myself as I have done on the video here. But I believe in the cause, and that cause is more important than my comfort zone.  Asking for other peoples money, is also something I'm not to comfortable with, especially if I don’t give into it myself. That would only make me a salesman for a random product I’m told to sell. For this project, besides having used most of my time the last several months on this project without getting paid,(which I’ll also continue to do for months to come), I’ve also spent close to 80.000 dollars of my own money on it. So this is something I’m really passionate about and therefore hope you will join in and perhaps be part of some movie history.  
 
Other Ways You Can Help
So again, please help us! It will be impossible to pull this of without your help. Even if it is just for a dollar it helps, and if you don’t have a dollar, sharing this Indiegogo campain on social media so perhaps some of your friends will consider supporting also helps a lot. 
Thank you for taking your time to read this presentation and watch the presentation video, and God bless.

<h3>DYSTOPIA - THE STORY</h3>
<p>Faith, a teenage war survivor, finds herself in trouble when her search for the safe and resourceful Eden is interrupted by a young girl that claims to know the way to it. This is a story about friendship, loss, and redemption in a world where no one can be trusted. How far would you go in order to survive?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>More about the story!</h2>
<p>DYSTOPIA is set in a post-apocalyptic world, right after the events of a brand new world war. Nobody is safe. There are almost no humans left. And every action provokes a consequence. The story revolves around Faith, a teenage war survivor, who’s desperate to find the Eden; a safe and resourceful area where everybody is safe. However, her path is altered when Ellie, a young girl, interrupts her path and claims to be from the Eden. Thus, Faith’s only hope is to trust that Ellie will bring her to the Eden…</p>
<p>The main source of inspiration for this short film has come straight out of movies like The Road and Book of Eli, which are iconic contemporary dystopian-theme pieces. Additionally, the music, characters, and visual aspects from The Last of Us have also a significant impact on the film’s style. Our main aim is to recapture the essence from this works with motivation and focused ambition.</p>
<h2>The Creators</h2>
<p>The original idea was created by Max Mir and Joan Payà, two film students pushing their comfort zone to its limits by developing their first Sci-Fi short film with only 5 minutes to share their story.</p>
<p>Born in Barcelona, Max Mir has been has been creating short films since he was 7 years old. He has a strong passion for directing and he ultimately aims to share his ideas all around the world. Meanwhile, Joan Payà discovered he had a talent for screenwriting almost 3 years ago when he started writing an Extended Essay on J.J. Abrams.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How can you be involved?</h2>
<p>We want to involve you as much as possible during the production of the film. Dystopia is also YOUR story, and we want to tell it as best as possible. As students, we are trying to achieve our dreams of sharing our stories with the world and communicating our ideas internationally. This campaign is important to us since we aim to develop as storytellers as well as become better artists. </p>
<p>We would love you to be involved in this film as much as you can. We need your help to make this world come alive and to make this story your story too. Being students we take any and all opportunities to develop as storytellers and bring our stories out into the world. We would love for you to help us achieve out dreams and help us to become better storytellers and artists.</p>

We want to expand our craft and learn as much as we can throughout these years, so we hope you can help us out and help us improve your stories!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where are we now?</h3>
<p>We are reaching the final draft of the script while we organize and plan the shoot in two weeks. Now we are in need of money to pay for locations and all the elements the Art Department will need to create a truly iconic post-apocalyptic aesthetic.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What we need and what you get:</h2>
<p>We need 1000 pounds that will be employed for actors, location financing, permits, props, costumes, art, setting, festival expenses, and extras such as transport and food.</p>
<p>And that's exactly why we need your help! Without you this project cannot be realized!</p>
<p>You can help us out even by sharing the page with your friends! However, if you decide to donate, you'll be eligible for many rewards such as a unique digital still, a greet and meet with the cast and crew, an IMDB credit, perhaps participating in the shoot, the script, and more!</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>We are an ambitious group with an ambitious project: we are going to use amazing interior and exterior locations, such as a forest and abandoned building in Ealing.</p>
<p>The booking and the usage of these kind of locations is a challenge and a risk for us. Because of that, the production team has hired specialized and certified people to guarantee the safety of the actors and crew as well as the correct functioning of the equipment.</p>

<h3>About The Film &amp; Director</h3>
<p>My name is Heather Harris and am the director of <i>Crush.</i> I am a USC MFA candidate from the very small and sunny country of the Cayman Islands. Mental illness is a very important topic to me and an issue I try to discuss in all of my art. Likewise, LGBTQ issues and rights have always been important to me. Growing up, I was president of Gay Straight Alliance at Trinity College School and an ambassador to the LGBTQ Center at NYU when I was an undergraduate student there. </p>
<p><i>Crush</i> is a psychological thriller that approaches both of these topics. When writing this film, I knew I wanted to showcase a lesbian relationship as LGBTQ narratives only take up 4.8% of all media programming, and out of that 4.8% only 23% depict lesbian characters, according to GLAAD in their 2016 report. I find these statistics to be very disheartening, and I believe that representation in Hollywood matters and needs to change. </p>
<p><i>Crush</i> is about much more than this, however. This film goes to very dark places and delves into the mind of someone with a mental illness who gradually descends into a state of depression and psychosis. The story centers on a well known writer named Greyson Michaelson who is trying to move forward from her past suicide attempt. When the American Suicide Survivors Association asks Greyson to write a speech about her past struggles, Greyson uses the opportunity to try to move beyond what happened to her. However, while doing so, she begins to be tormented by the allure of her suicidal tendencies. As Greyson becomes consumed with her writing, she discovers a new, darker side to her girlfriend and, ultimately, herself.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518747771/rhiqmer7aqqovezghrgm.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/>I wrote this story while consulting with a psychologist and have done my best to depict an accurate portrayal of what it is like to suffer from depression, psychosis, and suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>Our crew will shoot scenes underwater and create black voids in order to go inside the mind of our character who is challenged by these thoughts.</p>
<p>In addition, we intend to donate a portion of the profits we make to suicide prevention organizations, so you can feel good knowing that your money will be going to a good cause, while also helping a group of students pursue their passions.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518745742/ad5v90ssb41x2db4mbbd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>To make this story come to life we are trying to raise $25,000 USD in 30 days. This is no small feat and I realize that this is <u>a lot</u> to ask for!</p>
<p>Here is where the money is going towards: </p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, as this is a thesis film, it is going to be significantly longer in length (about 15 minutes), thus more shooting days are required. We will have a crew and cast of about 25-30 people and plan to shoot for 6-8 days, for 12 hours each day. Making sure all our crew and cast members are taken care of, fed, and have transportation, significantly contributes to this budget.<br/> </li>
<li>We need a good camera: We are hoping to shoot on a nice camera that will create the highest quality image possible, which will improve our chances of getting into film festivals and for our film to be seen by as many people as possible, thus we are hoping to use an Alexa Mini or a RED camera. The average rental price of a camera package in Los Angeles with a student discount for a RED (the cheaper of the two cameras) body with lenses and monitors for 6-8 days comes to around $4,000 USD. <br/> </li>
<li>We need grip, electric and underwater equipment: We will be using some USC equipment which will save some money however we also need a lot of various other items that the school does not provide, such as sliders, dollies, steadicams and underwater housing. For 6-8 days, with a student discount, we expect to pay around $2,000 USD for the basic equipment. Shooting underwater and getting underwater camera equipment will cost additional money that we are still negotiating. We will also need to rent a truck to transport this equipment. In addition, insurance for both camera and equipment will also be an additional $800 - $1,000. <br/> </li>
<li>Safety &amp; Stunts: Shooting underwater is risky for both our cinematographer, camera operator and our actor. In addition this film features fight scenes within the movie. Legally, to shoot this film we will need lifeguards, stunt coordinators, first aid and medical services, and a fire marshall to be present on set. these people must all be professionals and must be paid the industry standard salary for their 12 hours of work.  <br/> </li>
<li>Locations: This film only requires 3 locations. We will be renting a house or apartment, soundstages and a public pool for 6-8 days. For safety we have budgeted $4,500 USD. The price of the production will go up or down depending on what type and cost of locations we are able to find.<br/> </li>
<li>Production Design, Art Department, Makeup, Wardrobe and Costume: In order to make the locations and set look as realistic and believable as possible we need our production designers and art department. They will be renting props, painting, and decorating the set. In addition, the protagonist of this film has significant scars from her past suicide attempt so we will need a SFX makeup artist to create these effects. For these groups we have budgeted: $500 for wardrobe for the actors, $1,200 for makeup and hairdressing. $800 for set dressing, $1,000 for props, $1,500 for the art department and $500 for set construction. The price for production design will also go up or down depending on what locations we are able to find.<br/> </li>
<li>Sound and Score: We intend to get sound equipment for free from USC however as this film is going to have an original score, we will also need to rent recording stages and pay a sound mixer. <br/> </li>
<li>Color-grading: After the film is complete it must be color-graded to make sure the images and scenes all match and look as good as possible. A professional color-grader in Los Angeles, will cost around $1,500 USD. <br/> </li>
<li>Finally, we have publicity and film festivals. Film festivals cost around $20-70 each to apply to, so we have also budgeted for applications after the film is finished. We also have a 10% contingency just in case anything goes wrong. </li>
</ul>
<p>All editing, foley, sound dubbing and final mixing stages will be provided by USC.</p>
<p>Each donation no matter how small is important and we will give you a shout-out thank you on social media. Any donations of $25 and above will receive a personal thank you letter from the director.</p>
<p>In addition if you donate a large sum of money we will give you the title of being an associate, or executive producer on the film, credits and on IMDb. </p>

</div></div>","About The Film & Director
My name is Heather Harris and am the director of Crush. I am a USC MFA candidate from the very small and sunny country of the Cayman Islands. Mental illness is a very important topic to me and an issue I try to discuss in all of my art. Likewise, LGBTQ issues and rights have always been important to me. Growing up, I was president of Gay Straight Alliance at Trinity College School and an ambassador to the LGBTQ Center at NYU when I was an undergraduate student there. 
Crush is a psychological thriller that approaches both of these topics. When writing this film, I knew I wanted to showcase a lesbian relationship as LGBTQ narratives only take up 4.8% of all media programming, and out of that 4.8% only 23% depict lesbian characters, according to GLAAD in their 2016 report. I find these statistics to be very disheartening, and I believe that representation in Hollywood matters and needs to change. 
Crush is about much more than this, however. This film goes to very dark places and delves into the mind of someone with a mental illness who gradually descends into a state of depression and psychosis. The story centers on a well known writer named Greyson Michaelson who is trying to move forward from her past suicide attempt. When the American Suicide Survivors Association asks Greyson to write a speech about her past struggles, Greyson uses the opportunity to try to move beyond what happened to her. However, while doing so, she begins to be tormented by the allure of her suicidal tendencies. As Greyson becomes consumed with her writing, she discovers a new, darker side to her girlfriend and, ultimately, herself.I wrote this story while consulting with a psychologist and have done my best to depict an accurate portrayal of what it is like to suffer from depression, psychosis, and suicidal thoughts.
Our crew will shoot scenes underwater and create black voids in order to go inside the mind of our character who is challenged by these thoughts.
In addition, we intend to donate a portion of the profits we make to suicide prevention organizations, so you can feel good knowing that your money will be going to a good cause, while also helping a group of students pursue their passions.


Meet The Team
Because this is a global issue, we created a global team. Our crew members come from across the world, from South America to Asia, with a shared goal of telling a story we believe should be told.  






What We Need 
To make this story come to life we are trying to raise $25,000 USD in 30 days. This is no small feat and I realize that this is a lot to ask for!
Here is where the money is going towards:

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>""Nowhere, Forever"" is a short film about two dynamic female characters, told by a female-driven crew. It is a story that is not only deeply personal to myself and co-writer Libby Torres, but to any member of our generation.</p>
<p>We are at an extremely important cultural turning point where women's stories are finally getting the chance to be heard. We want to contribute to this new movement by making a film from a uniquely female point of view.</p>
<h2>The Characters</h2>
<p><i>Violet </i>- A fiery young narcissist driven by her passion for Mitchell. Her outward fervor and confidence masks a deeper, fundamental insecurity that she will never be capable of having a relationship. </p>
<p><i>Mitchell </i>- An unbelievably charming and talented writer whose ability to manipulate is matched by an inflated ego. For Mitchell, freedom and personal satisfaction come first, but he cannot deny a sense of possession he feels over Violet.   </p>
<p><i>Petra</i> - A compassionate protector with a tendency to invite toxic people into her life. Although she is experiencing a painful breakup, she puts aside her heartache in order to help her best friend through a difficult situation. Her limits are tested when Violet chooses Mitchell over her. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>A New Way To Tell Moving On</u></h3>
<p>To us the story of Jonny is such a personal one. It's one of love and decisions. Something we all have been through, and will go through eventually. When your heart guides you in multiple directions and you have to choose. Being able to tell such a bittersweet story is something we would both love to put on a screen, and with such wonderful music to accompany it we couldn't find any better way to execute it.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Makers?</u></h3>
<p><strong>The Director and Co-Writer - Andrew ""Ducky"" Dutkiewicz</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522519293/pgegwywakgth4pm10hrt.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<ul><li>I have always found the type of stories I want to tell are the ones closest to me. The ones that make me smile, cry, laugh, reminisce, The ones I can connect too. When I heard Matt's music to an EP he made I told him within minutes of the first song that we were going to make this into a film musical. Luckily he didn't find me weird and told me he loved the idea.</li></ul>
<p><strong>The Composer and Co-Writer - Matt Sperrazza</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522519370/zzz5eefm2u3yaqbe1esd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul><li>I originally wrote the EP ""Camp Ohana"" as an ode to my family and the feeling of leaving home for the first time. When Andrew came to me with the idea of making the album into a film I loved the idea of bringing the project full circle. </li></ul>
<p><strong>The Producer - Miguel McSongwe </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522615723/pbtnxxyfxmp4tnfd8vhj.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<ul><li>I've produced many short films before, most every one of Andrew's and when he came to me with Matt's EP I knew just as he did that this needed to be made into a film. A very short time later Matt, Andrew, and I were sitting around a table breaking down everything as we fully committed to putting this beautiful story on the big screen.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>So Why The 5000 Dollars?</u></h3>
<p>We've budgeted the film to be around $5000, this money is going to:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Recording, Mixing, and Mastering</b></li>
<li><b>Choreography</b></li>
<li><strong>Cast and Crew </strong></li>
<li><strong>Food</strong></li>
<li><strong>Transportation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Production Design</strong></li>
<li><strong>Equipment Rentals</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>​</strong>For our perks we chose what we think are the best ways to thank you as a help to our production. From some simple karma to the music both original and new to even an Executive Producer credit our team carefully and strategically picked out how we could give back to such fantastic people!</p>
<p>If we aren't able to reach the entire goal the funds will still go to the film and help as much as they can!</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Big Picture</u></h3>
<p>At the end of the day we hope Ohana can be made to it's ultimate potential with the help from you. And at the end of the week when the film is made we hope to be able to inspire and entertain as many people as possible. The theme of the film is so universal I think most people can look at their past, present, or even future and relate it to Jonny. They can use him to reminisce or to cope or to get ready for letting go and moving on into their next step in life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></h3>
<p>Other ways you could help us is to get our project out to your friends and family. Share it with everyone you know, scream Ohana from the highest rooftop.</p>
<p>Ohana means family, and no one gets left behind... don't leave your friends and family out of this!</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>

Being able to tell such a bittersweet story is something we would both love to put on a screen, and with such wonderful music to accompany it we couldn't find any better way to execute it.
The Makers?
The Director and Co-Writer - Andrew ""Ducky"" Dutkiewicz

I have always found the type of stories I want to tell are the ones closest to me. The ones that make me smile, cry, laugh, reminisce, The ones I can connect too. When I heard Matt's music to an EP he made I told him within minutes of the first song that we were going to make this into a film musical. Luckily he didn't find me weird and told me he loved the idea.
The Composer and Co-Writer - Matt Sperrazza

I originally wrote the EP ""Camp Ohana"" as an ode to my family and the feeling of leaving home for the first time. When Andrew came to me with the idea of making the album into a film I loved the idea of bringing the project full circle. 
The Producer - Miguel McSongwe 

I've produced many short films before, most every one of Andrew's and when he came to me with Matt's EP I knew just as he did that this needed to be made into a film. A very short time later Matt, Andrew, and I were sitting around a table breaking down everything as we fully committed to putting this beautiful story on the big screen.

So Why The 5000 Dollars?
We've budgeted the film to be around $5000, this money is going to:

Recording, Mixing, and Mastering
Choreography
Cast and Crew 
Food
Transportation
Production Design
Equipment Rentals

​For our perks we chose what we think are the best ways to thank you as a help to our production. From some simple karma to the music both original and new to even an Executive Producer credit our team carefully and strategically picked out how we could give back to such fantastic people!
If we aren't able to reach the entire goal the funds will still go to the film and help as much as they can!

The Big Picture
At the end of the day we hope Ohana can be made to it's ultimate potential with the help from you. And at the end of the week when the film is made we hope to be able to inspire and entertain as many people as possible. The theme of the film is so universal I think most people can look at their past, present, or even future and relate it to Jonny. They can use him to reminisce or to cope or to get ready for letting go and moving on into their next step in life.

Other Ways You Can Help
Other ways you could help us is to get our project out to your friends and family. Share it with everyone you know, scream Ohana from the highest rooftop.
Ohana means family, and no one gets left behind... don't leave your friends and family out of this!
Thank you so much!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------По-русскиПОДДЕРЖИВАЯ НАШ ФИЛЬМ, ВЫ ПОМОГАЕТЕ КАЖДОМУ РЕБЕНКУ С СИНДРОМОМ ДАУНА ИМЕТЬ ШАНС НА СЧАСТЛИВУЮ ЖИЗНЬ!ПОМОГИТЕ НАШЕМУ ТЕАТРУ ОТПРАВИТЬСЯ В СУДЬБОНОСНОЕ ПУТЕШЕСТВИЕ, А НАМ СНЯТЬ ОБ ЭТОМ ФИЛЬМ!Мы считаем, что именно с помощью кинематографа, через эмоциональное погружение, путешествие к мечте, мы сможем достучаться до зрительских сердец и повлиять на принятие «особенных» людей в обществе. “Съесть СЛОНА” – это не фильм о сочувствии к людям с ограниченными возможностями здоровья, это развлекательное кино, которое эмоционально вовлекает зрителя несмотря на особенности героев.Наш фильм снимается на пересечении жанров фильма-соревнования и “роад-муви”, он соберет всю Вашу семью перед экранами.Познакомьтесь с одним из наших актеровЭто Стас.Ему 21 год и всю его жизнь до театра он был официально признан необучаемым.Он провел большую часть своей жизни в социальной изоляции.Сейчас Стас играет в театре “ВзаимоДействие” со своими друзьями и они мечтают отправиться на международные гастроли в Австралию.Мы хотим исполнить их мечту и снять об этом фильм!ПОМОГИТЕ НАМ ИЗМЕНИТЬ ЖИЗНИ ЛЮДЕЙ С СИНДРОМОМ ДАУНА В РОССИИ И ВО ВСЕМ МИРЕ!Что если не все люди с ментальными или физическими особенностями требуют «специального отношения»?Что если нам еще только предстоит осознать, какую роль они играют в нашей жизни, и в отсутствие такого понимания мы не можем принять тот дар, который они приносят в наш мир?К сожалению, наше общество относится к людям с синдромом Дауна очень настроженно, игнорируя, не принимая их и притворяясь, что они не существуют. Им нет места ни на игровой площадке, ни в школе, ни в университе, ни на работе.Большинство людей с синдромом Дауна остаются в детских домах и в психологических лечебницах всю свою жизнь, потому что общество не принимает их.Семьи, в которых растут дети с синдромом Дауна, страдают от отсутствия образовательной, социальной помощи, а также от негативного отношения общества к людям с синдромом.ФактыВ России 85% семей отказываются от новорожденного с синдромом Дауна в роддоме. Часто именно медицинский персонал уговаривает матерей решиться на этот шаг.В Европе и США случаи отказов от малышей с синдромом не превышают 5%. В Скандинавских странах не зарегистрировано ни одного случая отказа от новорожденного с синдромом Дауна.В США 250 семей стоят в очереди на усыновление ребенка с синдромом Дауна.
Наша цель – изменить эту ситуацию!
Мы уверены, что большинство людей с синдромом Дауна могут быть замечательными, невероятно талантливыми актерами театра и кино, а их игра способна полностью перевернуть сознание зрителя.Помогите нам поделиться с миром счастьем взаимодействия с людьми с синдромом Дауна! Как у любого из нас, у людей с синдромом Дауна есть свои сильные и слабые стороны, особенности характера, привычки, хобби и интересы.Потенциал детей с синдромом Дауна гораздо лучше раскрывается, когда они живут в атмосфере любви и понимания, имеют доступ к специализированным ранним образовательным программам, имеют возможность получить необходимую медицинскую помощь, пойти в детский сад и школу, завести друзей и вести активную социальную жизнь.ИсторияНаша документальная комедия о судьбоносных событиях, которые происходят с актерами инклюзивного театра:
Вместе  с труппой театра мы начнем с самых первых репетиций нового спектакля. Через успехи и неудачи, надежды и отчаяния героев мы вместе с ними дойдем до премьеры
С замиранием сердца будем ждать результатов подачи заявки на театральный фестиваль
В случае неудачи мы  увидим, что поддержало героев и помогло им не опускать руки
А в случае победы - мы отправимся вместе с ними навстречу приключениям
СтильВ повествовании используется позитивный подход, который не делает акцента на “особенности” героев, вместо этого фокусируется на их харизматичной натуре.
Это не наблюдение за жизнью героев – зритель станет частью их жизни
Документальный фильм не как репортаж – а как увлекательная история
Репетиции, выступления, преодоление героями внутренних и внешних препятствий – все это будет снято в самом интимном эмоциональном контакте с героями
Документальный фильм – в современном художественном стиле, позволяющем зрителю почувствовать себя по-настоящему сопричастным
Почему мы должны снять этот фильм? МЫ ХОТИМ:

Распространить информацию о возможностях людей с синдромом Дауна

Сломать стереотипы о людях с синдромом Дауна и их способностях
Способствовать трудоустройству актеров с синдромом Дауна

Поменять отношение к социальному кино и театру –> создавая позитивное искусство

Привлечь зрителей и новых актеров в инклюзивный театр
Популяризировать инклюзивные и волонтерские проекты

<p>In late 2016, Aaron assembled a team of experienced and highly talented individuals to help bring the film, Hidden Light, to life.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We’ve already shot the film. That's right - it's done, which means the riskiest part is over! So your support will be going towards finessing and finishing an already high-quality product. </p>
<p>Right now, we're in post-production - doing the sound design, music, colour grading and so on. And then we'll be arranging all of our marketing materials in order to get this film onto the world stage, at the American Film Market in November. And that's what we need your help for.<br/><br/>The minimum budget for this final bit is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sound Design / Colouring / VFX - $6000</li>
<li>Music Composition - $3000</li>
<li>Poster Design / Press Kit Production - $4000</li>
<li>Deliverables (closed captioning, dialogue list) - $2000</li>
<li>Film Festival Entry Fees - $2000</li>
<li>American Film Market registration &amp; attendance - $8000</li>
<li>TOTAL: $25,000</li>
</ul>
<p>We already privately raised the money to cover the cost of production, and we have $10,000 remaining - which leaves us $15,000 short.<br/>Of course, if we are able to raise more than the required $15,000 - all of the additional funds will be used to further our marketing efforts to get this film on screens around the world.</p>
<p>We have some great 'rewards' on offer, from simply getting your own copy of the film, right up to becoming an Executive Producer on the film! And you've got nothing to lose - this film is going to be finished, so you're guaranteed to see the fruit of your contribution!</p>

<h3>Hello all,</h3>
<p>First off, thanks so much for visiting my page and considering helping ya girl out with this project. I'm going to be a senior at Liberty University this fall and that's the time of the year where our Cinematic Arts Program works hard to create over 50 thesis films! This is going to be my first short film where I am writing the script, directing the set and eventually editing the actual video content. I'm really looking forward to working with my fellow students and creating something amazing to share with all of you!</p>
<p><i>I really hope you get the chance to contribute to this project, so please sit back, relax, make yourself at home here! Check out the perks available on the right, and feel free to read the information below and ask questions, I'll be here all week. </i></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If you're wondering what the crew could possibly need this money for, here's the short answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Locations </u>- This is one of the biggest components as far as cost goes, because often times it needs to be reserved in advance. </li>
<li>
<u>Craft Services (aka food!)</u> - Our long days leave little time for rest, but when we do, WE EAT. Our cast and crew could use some nutritional substance other than coffee. </li>
<li>
<u>Hair, Makeup, and Wardrobe</u> - This will help keep our cast looking authentic and consistent for your viewing pleasure. </li>
<li>
<u>Props</u> - *spoiler alert* let's just say that we hope to break some bottles...</li>
<li>
<u>Transportation</u> - To put it bluntly, we need gas money to get from place to place. </li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By backing this project, you're not only giving a chance to its creators, but giving an opportunity to its audience. Film is a fantastic medium to connect with people, to bring people together and to have them feel understood, even if its just for 10-15 minutes. We as filmmakers are looking forward to creating content that makes people ponder ideas, and maybe even think about the story after they walk away. As a crew, we're practicing and honing our skills, and it's not always easy (or free). We're so excited to work on this project in the upcoming year and to work hard mastering the thing we love most; storytelling. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course with filmmaking there are going to be some obstacles throughout the production. Our professor has said, ""If something isn't going wrong, you're not making a great film"". Hurdles are practically guaranteed in this industry, but as young creators we are learning to be prepared and adapt to sudden changes and problems; thats the point of this project. With your help in aiding this project financially, it makes the mountains of problems look like ant hills. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If now isn't the time for you to help out financially, there are a multitude of others things that you can do to help out. Some of them being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go like and share the Facebook page at <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/switchbladeshortfilm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/switchbladeshortfilm</a></strong> to get updates on the project, as well as connect with others who are also looking forward to the film</li>
<li>Follow the film's twitter account for some exclusive content and stay up to date on the film's progress at <strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/Switchblade2018"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/Switchblade2018</a></strong>
</li>
<li>Even if you'd like to pray for the cast and crew, [that we remain safe, on track and meet our goals] it will help us tremendously knowing that we have your support</li>

Props - *spoiler alert* let's just say that we hope to break some bottles...

We're so excited to work on this project in the upcoming year and to work hard mastering the thing we love most; storytelling. 

Risks & Challenges
Of course with filmmaking there are going to be some obstacles throughout the production. Our professor has said, ""If something isn't going wrong, you're not making a great film"". Hurdles are practically guaranteed in this industry, but as young creators we are learning to be prepared and adapt to sudden changes and problems; thats the point of this project. With your help in aiding this project financially, it makes the mountains of problems look like ant hills. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If now isn't the time for you to help out financially, there are a multitude of others things that you can do to help out. Some of them being:

<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>My name is Gabriela Concha. I’m a Peruvian photographer currently working on a movie and photobook project of a mining camp in southern Peru. I have been invited for a summer artist residency at The Hollows Art Space located in Brooklyn, New York, USA from June 1, 2017 until October 1, 2017 during which I’ll be editing the projects and will also have the opportunity to participate in their exhibitions and programming events.</p>
<p> ‘Open Pit’, in Spanish ‘Tajo Abierto’, refers to an open wound on the surface of a terrain. The company that temporarily owns the place is engaged in the extraction of copper using open pit mining.</p>
<p>The main characters of this story are the eldest women, including my mother, who have lived there for over thirty years. Most of them don’t work for the company and cannot professionally develop freely since it’s a secluded little place, thus having to assume the role of housewives. </p>
<p>It is also a personal story since I was born and lived there for seventeen years. After a long time I return to confirm that something blocks my recognition of this place, unleashing a desire of claim and reconciliation. From this event I sought to understand the notion of time and distance that is experienced in a place that, because of its size and isolation, has other characteristics. I unfold a territory with big gardens that have a beautiful view of the mountains, but the ideal landscape between its cuts ends up giving away.

 ‘Open Pit’, in Spanish ‘Tajo Abierto’, refers to an open wound on the surface of a terrain. The company that temporarily owns the place is engaged in the extraction of copper using open pit mining.
The main characters of this story are the eldest women, including my mother, who have lived there for over thirty years. Most of them don’t work for the company and cannot professionally develop freely since it’s a secluded little place, thus having to assume the role of housewives. 
It is also a personal story since I was born and lived there for seventeen years.

<p>As much as we would like to, we can't make this project alone - and we need your help! So c'mon, jump into one of our spaceships and let's fly into orbit around planet Money for a bit.</p>
<p>Our target goal is 25,000$. Here's the break down on where your money will be going: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>The Studio. </strong>In order to film this piece, we will need to rent a studio for at least 5 days. We are not only filming the short, but also the full scenes, so you can enjoy it, and we can have great footage to show once we start pitching our series!</li>
<li>
<strong>The Set.</strong> The set is very elaborate. I mean, it's a crazy set. We have Victorian corridors, spaceships, command rooms, castles - all kinds of places! And most of them will have to be built. Yeah, you can already imagine how much is that going to cost. </li>
<li>
<b>Costumes &amp; Props</b>. We're aiming for quality entertainment, not just some third-rate-short. We want to give you the best we've got, therefore we want every detail to be perfect. Costumes are very important to this story! </li>
<li>
<strong>Commercials &amp; Festival Fees</strong>. Beyond pitching, we also want this short to circle around in festivals. It's a great story on its own and it should be told on big screens too!</li>
</ol>
<p>You want to know what you get out of it, don't you? Well, I can say that our perk list is pretty impressive. We have posters, stickers, shoutouts, official 'thank you' credits, CDs, DVDs and much much more. We also have an array of hidden perks - you will have to scavenge through our social media to find those, but I can guarantee, you won't be disappointed. </p>
<p>In the unlikely event that we don't raise the amount we need, we will work with what we've got. the entire team is dedicated to the project and we won't let this just pass. So even if we don't raise the amount, don't worry, we won't let it waste. Also, did I mention that entire cast &amp; crew works for free? Yes, that's how dedicated we are. And on that note...</p>

<div style=""font-family: 'Parisienne', cursive;font-size: 25px;"">Bessy Adut, Co-director</div>
<p>Hey! This is Bessy. I have a BA degree in Film &amp; Television from Istanbul; MFA degree in Film Directing from CalArts and a professional screenwriting certificate from UCLA! I've been working on film sets for over 10 years now. I wrote, directed, produced several short films and promo videos. I've also worked on movies, commercials and television projects wearing several different hats. I aspire to become an accomplished international writer/director and send good messages to the world. My most recent passion project was a short film I wrote and directed ""That Cake"" for the 2nd Act Film Festival. Fun strange fact about me: I feel like my cats are my adopted kids and when people find that strange, I find them strange.</p>
<div style=""font-family: 'Parisienne', cursive;font-size: 25px;"">Jake Lefkowitz, the Composer</div>
<p>Hey everyone! I'm Jake Lefkowitz and I am a  film composer, musician, and audio engineer with influences and inspirations from composers such as John Williams and Alan Silvestri to Gustav Holst. I have studied at SAE NYC, where I was able to develop my audio engineering and production skills and I am currently studying film scoring and video game scoring at Berklee College of Music. I love to work with filmmakers and connect with people. Music isn't just notes on a page to me; music is a language capable of connecting emotions and telling a story, and that is what I aim to do.</p>
<div style=""font-family: 'Parisienne', cursive;font-size: 25px;"">Jeremiah Goldston, Production Designer</div>
<p>What's up world?! My name is Jeremiah Goldston. I am a freelance conceptual design and storyboard artist, living and working in Albuquerque, NM. I recently graduated from the Southwest University of Visual Arts, here in Albuquerque. I have a BA in Illustration, with a minor in Graphic Design. My specialty is tech, vehicle, and weapon designs with some environment and costume work, primarily within the sci-fi genre, but I will also work in fantasy design as well.</p>

<p>Hello my name is Jamie Yun and I'm currently getting a bachelors in acting for film at New York Film Academy! I've been acting since the beginning of my freshman year in high school. I've always been interested in the arts (music, painting, etc).  I wanted to broaden my hobbies, so I tried out taking 'drama' as an elective at school- not having a clue that I would fall madly in love with it for life. I immediately became a theatre nerd and I have absolutely no regrets. My most recent project is an original comedy play that I got to be a part of in the beginning of June where I got to originate a character for the first time on stage!</p>
<div style=""font-family: 'Parisienne', cursive;font-size: 25px;"">Mikki Hernandez, Alex</div>
<p>Hey! I graduated from UCLA and worked in the corporate side of entertainment before pursuing acting. I decided the office life is not for me, started acting classes, and have been training at the Don Bloomfield Acting Studio for the past two and a half years. I also do voiceover, improv and have a background in dance. </p>
<div style=""font-family: 'Parisienne', cursive;font-size: 25px;"">Nicola George, Sidero</div>
<p>Hey guys! I started theatre at the age of 10 and had my first lead role in a musical at the age of 14. I attended the prestigious Newtown High School of the performing arts and completed my high Diploma in Music, Dance and Drama with top marks and received and award for highest achievement in performing arts. Outside of acting I sing, play piano and love to do martial arts. Fun fact: I'm also a bellydancer. </p>

<p>Hello everyone! I am Patricia Mizen. I was raised in North Carolina and come from a military family.  I started on stage and my biggest passion is storytelling;  to bring characters to life and tell their story. My first professional training was in Boston at the Actors Theatre Institute.  I have worked on network shows such as Passions, NCIS, House of Cards and other independent films. I was also selected into UCLA's Professional Program and will receive a certificate of completion in September 2017.  I am looking forward in being the character of Keket and to be a part of this thrilling Sci-fi series. </p>

<p>Hey! I am Kaitlin Clark, native to Boston, MA. I am trained in both theatre and film acting.  After falling in love with stage performance within my own community, I was driven to enter the Dramatic Arts program in New York’s Hofstra University. The Big Apple was the perfect place to feed my curiosities of the arts, culture and the world. The bustling, creative atmosphere gave me a chance to truly experiment, expand, study and explore my craft.  It was here that I began honing my art for film, getting cast in both supporting and lead roles of numerous productions. Since graduating, I moved to the City of Angels and continuously work in film, television, theatre and award-winning web series, with no signs of slowing down.  </p>

<p>We the directors, Peter T.Breen and Sarah-Stephanie Skjoldevik were brought together whilst growing through our own painful experiences. Filmmaking was a joint passion and we realized there was a message that had to be shared, a message of hope.</p>

<h3>Why ""Hands Down - An Arm Wrestling Docu-Journey""? </h3>
<p>My name is Christopher Bruce, owner of Bruce Productions.  My passion is in bringing life to my own and others stories through video and film projects.  We all have a story to tell and there is an audience for every story.</p>
<p>When a good friend and client, Jamie Pagliei from US Masonry and Chimney, came to me with an idea of supporting this young guy suffering from Spina Bifida he met at a recent Arm Wrestling Tournament in Philadelphia I was immediately interested to learn more.  My first thought was this needs to be a documentary and people would love to hear this story.  Other than the popular 80's Stallone hit ""Over The Top"" there really hasn't been anything significant done to shine a light on the world of Arm Wrestling let alone involving a guy overcoming incredible odds and competing with Spina Bifida.  </p>
<p>The more we dug into the potential of the story, the more it was clear it needed to happen and that we could deliver a truly unique experience to the viewer.  </p>

<p>Contributors to this project can feel great that they are supporting TEAM USA and their mission to compete in the World Championships in Budapest as a portion of the proceeds are going to cover transportation and housing costs.  Funds collected through this campaign will also go towards the filming and completion of the documentary capturing the whole journey while offering us all an opportunity to get lost in the world of Arm Wrestling far beyond our lunchroom tables in grade school.</p>

<li>If we hit $25,000 in this campaign, it will ensure we have money to set up additional interviews with key people in the sport, capture local arm wrestling tournaments and spend more time with our main subjects to dig further into their backgrounds and personal stories.</li>

<p>SHORT SUMMARY</p>
<p>Come Back is an Indie/Drama about Mara, a 24 year old woman, who has decided to leave a 2 year relationship. She and Jason (26) met through online dating and their whirlwind courtship has led them to be living together and engaged by their 1st anniversary. However, getting together too quickly may have caused them to overlook some serious flaws in their relationship and communication, which has caused much fighting and distress on both sides.  Now, two years on, Mara can’t take it anymore and has decided to leave.  On her way out she begins to reminisce on the good and bad times they had together, and a plea from Jason to return has Mara second-guessing her decision.  Will she continue on to start a new life elsewhere, or will she return to try to patch things up with Jason?</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Before Queen Elizabeth II. Before Queen Victoria. Before Henry VIII. Wolves roamed the UK wilderness. 500 years after the last wolf was hunted and killed in Britain, efforts are now being made to reintroduce them to the Scottish Isles.</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509380506/tavugzlz6ab1ugcjdg7s.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<h3>What is the film about?</h3>
<p><i>Return of the Wolves </i>will be a 1 x 1 hour long documentary investigating the reintroduction of wolves to the UK. Interviewing experts, the documentary aims to inform the audience about the ecological impact wolves could have on the landscape, and include personal accounts from those affected by the presence of the animals. Now that beavers have been successfully re-introduced, could wolves be the next logical step towards re-wilding Britain?</p>
<p>Return of the Wolves is an ambitious project which aims to film in multiple locations across the UK and overseas in Europe. With your investment, we will travel to Rome to film wolves in the wild, as well as interview well-known wolf conservationist, Luigi Boitani. In the height of discussions surrounding global ecological changes, we believe this film is an exciting and engaging project for you to become a part of.</p>
<p><strong>""</strong>Rewilding is the most important issue facing humanity today, with the potential to reduce the costs and burdens on future generations, allowing them to thrive on our planet. Creating a Britain that could welcome and sustain the wolves return is perhaps the most relevant sign that we have accepted the responsibility to hand our planet on to future generations and accept the challenges of creating land use efficiency and environmental sustainability.  Creating a vivid documentary that showcases the challenges and benefits of bringing wolves back to the UK, and how that will cause a cascade of benefits for all our wildlife is the most pressing issue in nature conservation today. Such a documentary is vital to engaging and inspiring the next generation of nature conservationists.<strong>""</strong> <strong>Peter Smith, co-founder and director at The Wildwood Trust.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“</strong>Return of the Wolves will examine a very controversial issue which has been in discussion at many rewilding talks for several years now. Just what would happen is the wolf returned to the UK, can it return and how could it adapt in our modern Britain? I am very supportive of this crowdfunder, as I believe that it is a documentary that needs to be made and a topic needing to be discussed. How likely will the wolf be returned to Great Britain  and could it survive in our modern world of agriculture and farming or do other things need to happen first? Well if you help sponsor this crowdfunder, you just may find out the answer<strong>”</strong> <strong>Anneka Svenska – Wildlife Presenter, Wolf Expert and Conservationist</strong></p>

<h3>What do we need?</h3>
<p>In order to make <i>Return of the Wolves  </i>the highest standard production we can, we are going to need your help. Producing a film can quickly become a very expensive undertaking, especially when there are plans to film in multiple locations. So, should you choose to support us, here is a breakdown of where your money will go: </p>
<p><b>Travel and Accommodation </b>- The main bulk of our production costs will go towards travel. With your investment we plan to travel to Rome, Scotland, Reading, and Devon (among other places) and therefore will need to cover travel and accommodation costs to each location.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>Return of the Wolves </i>aims to educate you on the reintroduction of large predators to the UK, with the intention of reducing the stigma surrounding the animals. We are going into the project open to change depending on which way the evidence takes us, but are personally in support of re-wilding Britain. This shall not, however, affect the way the documentary is made. We will interview a range of people who support and are against the reintroduction. As this documentary is investigating whether the proposal would work in the UK, it is vital that people are educated on the positive and negative consequences in a way that is both engaging and entertaining. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“When they hear about us talking about reintroducing wolves they<br/>immediately imagine packs of wolves ravishing all the sheep in the uplands,<br/>running amok and rushing down the precinct to tear down a grandmother or two!”<strong> </strong></p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges:</h3>
<p>What could go wrong?</p>
<p>We plan to shoot interviews with experts, those who have more personal, first-hand experiences with wolves, as well as those who could be negatively affected by the return of the animals. Intercut with these interviews will be shots of wolves, deer, and sweeping landscapes - if it's likely to contribute positively to a nature documentary it'll be there. Unfortunately, nature is <i>never</i>  predictable. If we are unable to get the natural footage we desire, we have a back up plan to film wolves in a more controlled environment. If this also doesn't go to plan, we intend to purchase the highest quality stock footage to make up for lost images. </p>
<p>At all times, Iris Productions will be following extensive shooting plans, adhering to health and safety protocols and making sure you're money is being put to its best possible use. If there are ever any serious setbacks relating to the production of the film, we will be sure to keep you updated via our social media sites and via the hashtag #ROTWFilm. </p>

</div></div>","Before Queen Elizabeth II. Before Queen Victoria. Before Henry VIII. Wolves roamed the UK wilderness. 500 years after the last wolf was hunted and killed in Britain, efforts are now being made to reintroduce them to the Scottish Isles.

What is the film about?
Return of the Wolves will be a 1 x 1 hour long documentary investigating the reintroduction of wolves to the UK. Interviewing experts, the documentary aims to inform the audience about the ecological impact wolves could have on the landscape, and include personal accounts from those affected by the presence of the animals. Now that beavers have been successfully re-introduced, could wolves be the next logical step towards re-wilding Britain?
Return of the Wolves is an ambitious project which aims to film in multiple locations across the UK and overseas in Europe. With your investment, we will travel to Rome to film wolves in the wild, as well as interview well-known wolf conservationist, Luigi Boitani. In the height of discussions surrounding global ecological changes, we believe this film is an exciting and engaging project for you to become a part of.
""Rewilding is the most important issue facing humanity today, with the potential to reduce the costs and burdens on future generations, allowing them to thrive on our planet. Creating a Britain that could welcome and sustain the wolves return is perhaps the most relevant sign that we have accepted the responsibility to hand our planet on to future generations and accept the challenges of creating land use efficiency and environmental sustainability.  Creating a vivid documentary that showcases the challenges and benefits of bringing wolves back to the UK, and how that will cause a cascade of benefits for all our wildlife is the most pressing issue in nature conservation today. Such a documentary is vital to engaging and inspiring the next generation of nature conservationists."" Peter Smith, co-founder and director at The Wildwood Trust.
“Return of the Wolves will examine a very controversial issue which has been in discussion at many rewilding talks for several years now. Just what would happen is the wolf returned to the UK, can it return and how could it adapt in our modern Britain? I am very supportive of this crowdfunder, as I believe that it is a documentary that needs to be made and a topic needing to be discussed. How likely will the wolf be returned to Great Britain  and could it survive in our modern world of agriculture and farming or do other things need to happen first? Well if you help sponsor this crowdfunder, you just may find out the answer” Anneka Svenska – Wildlife Presenter, Wolf Expert and Conservationist

What do we need?
In order to make Return of the Wolves  the highest standard production we can, we are going to need your help. Producing a film can quickly become a very expensive undertaking, especially when there are plans to film in multiple locations. So, should you choose to support us, here is a breakdown of where your money will go: 
Travel and Accommodation - The main bulk of our production costs will go towards travel. With your investment we plan to travel to Rome, Scotland, Reading, and Devon (among other places) and therefore will need to cover travel and accommodation costs to each location.
Hiring a Cinematographer - We want to work with the best crew we can. To increase the visual quality of our production, we aspire to hire in a professional wildlife cinematographer to capture our wild wolf footage.
Music Production - Similarly, music is key in holding together a documentary production and we want an original soundtrack composed and produced for our documentary.
All of this costs money and that is where you come in! Please donate anything you can to help us make this project a reality. In return for your pledges, we have some exclusive perks up for grabs. These include: 

Having your name credited in the film
Digital downloads and BTS footage
Physical DVD copies of the film
Invitations to our film premiere

This is an amazing opportunity for us to produce a film that could kick start our careers in the creative industries. We cannot wait for you to get involved!

<p>When I was researching my last film, I came across a gentleman by the name of Rick Simpson. I had heard many things, but nobody really knew anything about him. We all know that he rediscovered nature's cure for cancer by healing himself, and then began giving the oil out to patients; but we do not know much else. I have been dealing with crohns disease, arthritis, and a host of anxiety issues my entire life; so when I heard about this oil it really peaked my interest, both as a filmmaker and as a cannabis patient. I immediately thought, if this oil could work for cancer; imagine what else it could work for!?! I eventually ingested 90 grams of this oil over a 120 day period and cured my crohns disease!! So I flew out to meet the man himself over in Europe in November 2016. We had many coffees together and shot an interview. We also traveled to Ljubljana, Slovenia to record at a patients event there. His passion and dedication to the cause immediately inspired me to shoot this project. However,  a year into production I realized that I can not do this alone, and desperately need your help.

<p>A través de las entrevistas profundizaremos en las diferentes maneras en que la discriminación de género se manifiesta: sexualización del deporte en la infancia; vulneración de los derechos de las mujeres en el deporte; diferencia en los sueldos, presupuestos e incentivos económicos; falta de visibilidad en los medios de comunicación, titulares machistas y fotografías ofensivas publicados en diferentes medios; menor reconocimiento a pesar de los logros obtenidos; dificultades para encontrar patrocinios; falta de apoyo a la profesionalización; ausencia de mujeres en cuerpos técnicos y/o federaciones; excesiva atención sobre la apariencia física de una deportista e incluso utilización de su cuerpo como espectáculo; uso sexista del lenguaje…</p>

<p>Capitaneando este equipo se encuentra nuestra Cynisca jefa, <strong>Beatriz Carretero</strong>. Productora incansable, directora y coguionista del documental. Apasionada, luchadora y soñadora empedernida, Bea es amante y fiel seguidora del deporte femenino desde que tiene uso de razón. Inconformista nata y defensora acérrima de la mujer y de sus derechos, se ha dejado la piel en este proyecto, ha dado el 100% y mucho más, poniendo su granito de arena en esta lucha, con lo que es su profesión y su motor, el cine.</p>
<p>Hace años, tras asistir a los Juegos Olímpicos de Londres 2012, empezó a rondarle la idea de que había que contar esta historia, de lo injusto e indignante que era el trato hacia las mujeres deportistas, y la falta de repercusión, de visibilidad y de reconocimiento a pesar de todos los logros obtenidos.</p>
<p>Su gran sueño con el documental es conseguir una igualdad de género real en el deporte y en todos los ámbitos de nuestra sociedad, y que Hijas de Cynisca llegue a todos los niveles sociales, a primera división y a tercera, a tu barrio, a la escuela, a las grandes empresas, a todas las profesiones, a todas las edades, a un patio de un recreo y a una pantalla de cine, en nuestro país y en el resto del mundo.</p>

Una discriminación que es sólo un reflejo público de lo que estas mujeres viven en su día a día al realizar su actividad profesional.
Lo que ocurre en el deporte no es sino una manifestación de un problema global. Pero gracias a su gran repercusión mediática, cualquier paso que se dé en el mundo del deporte para deshacerse de esta lacra se convertiría inmediatamente en un ejemplo a seguir en el resto de nuestra sociedad.
Este documental pretende mostrar la situación actual de discriminación que se interpone en el día a día de las mujeres deportistas. Queremos mostrar cuánto se ha avanzado y cuánto queda aún por conseguir, en el convencimiento de que cualquier paso dado en la dirección correcta tendrá consecuencias mucho más allá del mundo del deporte.
Para lograr la concienciación del espectador es necesario ofrecerle historias y personas reales con las cuales empatizar. Para ello contamos con el testimonio de varias deportistas de élite tanto retiradas como en activo, y otras personas más o menos relacionadas con el mundo del deporte, quienes nos contarán sus experiencias a lo largo de su carrera.
A través de las entrevistas profundizaremos en las diferentes maneras en que la discriminación de género se manifiesta: sexualización del deporte en la infancia; vulneración de los derechos de las mujeres en el deporte; diferencia en los sueldos, presupuestos e incentivos económicos; falta de visibilidad en los medios de comunicación, titulares machistas y fotografías ofensivas publicados en diferentes medios; menor reconocimiento a pesar de los logros obtenidos; dificultades para encontrar patrocinios; falta de apoyo a la profesionalización; ausencia de mujeres en cuerpos técnicos y/o federaciones; excesiva atención sobre la apariencia física de una deportista e incluso utilización de su cuerpo como espectáculo; uso sexista del lenguaje…
A partir de esta información y de los datos recogidos previa investigación al rodaje y contrastados por expertos en la materia, mostraremos propuestas para combatir esta desigualdad. Cualquier avance en la lucha por la igualdad de género en el deporte podría convertirse en el origen de un cambio global que beneficie a las mujeres de todos los sectores sociales.

QUIÉNES SOMOS 
Detrás de Hijas De Cynisca hay un equipo de personas comprometidas, con un gran talento y que comparten el deseo común de vivir en un mundo más justo, en el que no exista la desigualdad de género.
Puedes ver fotos del equipo, biofilmografías y enlaces en nuestra página web:


Capitaneando este equipo se encuentra nuestra Cynisca jefa, Beatriz Carretero. Productora incansable, directora y coguionista del documental. Apasionada, luchadora y soñadora empedernida, Bea es amante y fiel seguidora del deporte femenino desde que tiene uso de razón. Inconformista nata y defensora acérrima de la mujer y de sus derechos, se ha dejado la piel en este proyecto, ha dado el 100% y mucho más, poniendo su granito de arena en esta lucha, con lo que es su profesión y su motor, el cine.
Hace años, tras asistir a los Juegos Olímpicos de Londres 2012, empezó a rondarle la idea de que había que contar esta historia, de lo injusto e indignante que era el trato hacia las mujeres deportistas, y la falta de repercusión, de visibilidad y de reconocimiento a pesar de todos los logros obtenidos.
Su gran sueño con el documental es conseguir una igualdad de género real en el deporte y en todos los ámbitos de nuestra sociedad, y que Hijas de Cynisca llegue a todos los niveles sociales, a primera división y a tercera, a tu barrio, a la escuela, a las grandes empresas, a todas las profesiones, a todas las edades, a un patio de un recreo y a una pantalla de cine, en nuestro país y en el resto del mundo.

<h3>What Are We Gaining and Losing Through 'Legalization' in Canada</h3>
<p><strong>Change is coming in Canada, and in our opinion it is long overdue.</strong> But, when you look a little bit closer things might not be happening in the right way. Educating ourselves is the best way to make sure things can happen in ways that are best for all involved, particularly medical users of cannabis.</p>
<p>From HamiltonSeen's award-winning documentary filming team of Cody Lanktree and Zena Hagerty comes this important, timely new project (that part was written by our publicist) : </p>
<p>'Dispensed With' will be a compelling look into today's battle over cannabis dispensaries, featuring conversations with the advocates who brought us to this point, the store owners and the budtenders, the people they serve, the medical patients that count on them - and the ongoing police raids attempting to crush this growing industry. </p>
<p><strong>There's a lot the public doesn't know.</strong> While mainstream media occasionally reports on raids on cannabis dispensaries, they rarely look beyond the police press release.  'Dispensed With' tells the stories that have not been told.</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Your help in this is huge.</strong> This is a film that can and will help make change to Canada's perspective on cannabis.</li></ul>
<p>We're making a film to keep folks informed of how this is all happening, and how to make sure you are protected during this important time of change.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Are We Pulling This Off?</h3>
<p>As of right now, we are already in production on the film, and about a quarter of the way into interviews. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the largest cost in a the making of a film is promoting it, and this campaign will take us some very large steps forward in raising awareness and in making the connections we need to get nation-wide distribution and have maximum impact as legalization takes place.</p>
<ul>
<li>We're shooting for 15 grand, which is about half of our production budget, the rest being covered by personal investment and sponsorship from some of the good folks we're meeting along the way.</li>
<li>We've been feeling very lucky in having the support of some integral folks in the cannabis community across Canada. Their support and yours means the world to us and means the success of this project.</li>
<li>Ultimately, we are on track to complete this film by July and this crowd-funding support allows us to make a stronger film that is professionally colorized and has a big impact.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The path to Canada having a healthy relationship with cannabis and with cannabis users is through education and impactful information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our largest goal is to help medical users understand how to protect themselves and have access to quality medication that works for them.</li>
<li>In the past few years we have made three impactful and important films, including 'Harperman: A Dissident Serenade', about the impact of the Harperman protest song before the last Canadian election. We feel proud to have contributed to keeping the electorate informed about an important slice of Canadian politics.  </li>
<li>We are currently in pre-production of a long-term project called 'Women's Work', which is a historical documentary about the vast contributions of women in computer programming.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We’re an award winning three-person team that creates films intended to create positive change through information, art and maybe a little bit of humour. This will be our fourth feature-length documentary, and we have a combined number of years in media creation that would be embarrassing to state, as we all look young and gorgeous (except Cody).</p>
<p><strong>Director Cody Lanktree</strong> is most inspired by dialogue created by the connection between time, beauty, and our personal truths. In the eight years since HamiltonSeen’s inception, Cody has guided the company from small commercial production to whiteboxing partnerships with major marketing firms, and finally to the creation of documentaries focused on community and larger social issues. His vision is one that will not stop at less than fundamentally changing and challenging perspectives and the world.</p>
<p><strong>Producer Zena Hagerty</strong> has a long history of community engagement and involvement in the arts scenes of Hamilton and San Francisco and seeks to further strengthen the human spirit with her work. Zena has broad experience in media, including recording albums, performing her own music, radio broadcasting, graphic design, and many others. As director of Sublimatus as a band, an art gallery, and an entity that inspires the creative spirit within all, Zena has honed a skillset that includes the ability to drive and complete large projects with expansive intentions.</p>
<p><strong>Executive Producer Tracy Lamourie</strong> is our connection to the world of cannabis and the world of promotion. Tracy is primarily a publicist, but is a brilliant generalist who brings a lot to the table.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Get the word out about your feelings about cannabis. Folks are starting to understand that we weren't told the truth when we were kids. Also, tell a friend or two about what we're doing and why. <strong>Spreading the word about this film is what will make it a success.</strong></p>

The Impact
The path to Canada having a healthy relationship with cannabis and with cannabis users is through education and impactful information.

Our largest goal is to help medical users understand how to protect themselves and have access to quality medication that works for them.
In the past few years we have made three impactful and important films, including 'Harperman: A Dissident Serenade', about the impact of the Harperman protest song before the last Canadian election. We feel proud to have contributed to keeping the electorate informed about an important slice of Canadian politics.

<h3>A mystery solved, Government lies exposed!</h3>
<p>This feature film will help drive interest and solve a 52 year old mystery.  The US government has refused to tell the truth, even to the Clintons.  What is so secret that even they can't know?  But to expose the truth, we can't just depend on traditional film financing, we need your help.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm Cody Knotts, an award-winning producer (Most Anticipated Horror Film of 2015 from Horror Society) who has worked with famed actors Roddy Piper, Doug Bradley and Kurt Angle, among others.  </li>
<li>The public deserves to know the truth about Kecksburg. Our government has no right to continue to hide the truth.  Even Hillary Clinton can't get the records, but this feature film can help keep Kecksburg in the public eye.  Even more important, this film can help drive tourism to the Pittsburgh region and Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. Roswell gets $95 million annually and Kecksburg nearly nothing.  </li>
<li>Are you tired of your government lying to you?  Then join our fight, help us make this film.  Help us expose the truth.  </li>
<li>Do you care about Pittsburgh?  Would you like to help change a region for the better?  </li>
<li>Films are forever.  They last beyond our lifetimes.  This is our chance to tell a story that has fascinated the public for decades.  Bryant Gumble, <i>Ancient Aliens</i>, <i>Unsolved Mysteries</i> and <i>the History Channel</i>  have all investigated Kecksburg but no one has brought the legend to life, until now.  We need your help and we want you to be a part of the legend.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pittsburgh Roswell</h3>
<p>Roswell generates $95 million annually, Kecksburg nearly nothing.  Although Kecksburg has more documentation, more witnesses and more mystery... it has never been commercialized.  This film is the key element in changing that dynamic, both shedding a light on the truth and jump starting the local economy of Pittsburgh, the Laurel Highlands, Westmoreland, Somerset and Fayette Counties.</p>
<p>As part of these efforts, we are working with local political leaders to bring this film to life. In addition, local Pittsburgh stars like <strong>Curt Wootton</strong> (Pittsburgh Dad), <strong>Shane Douglas</strong> (5 time world wrestling champion) and <strong>Richard John Walters</strong> (<i>My Bloody Valentine 3D</i>) are all part of the cast.</p>
<p>We have agreed to donate props and the spaceship designed by former CMU graduate Dr. Fuzzy Mauldin to the Kecksburg Fire Department for the <strong>creation of a museum</strong> dedicated to Kecksburg.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding from<strong> <i>you</i></strong> to <b><i><u>e</u></i></b><u><i><strong>nsure artistic integrity</strong></i></u>.  With a film that threatens to expose the truth about our Government's lies, we need you more than ever.  Every level of donation to this film includes cool rewards.  Our goal was to give you stuff that we would want if we were donating.</p>
<ul>
<li>Films need money, period pieces need even more.  Our lead actors are all working for the same day rate (other than some specific cameos).  Why? Because everyone in this film is dedicated to revealing the truth about Kecksburg.  But for the film to work, we need to be able to film for at least a month.  The more money we raise, the more time to film to make the story incredible.  </li>
<li>Our Aliens and Spaceship designs are being made by Morgantown, WV<strong> High School Art students</strong> from designs by famed founder of Lycos Michael ""Fuzzy"" Mauldin, one of the inventors of the Search Engine.  Not only do you get the coolest spaceship sculpture but you help inspire young people in rural West Virginia to become artists. </li>
<li>
<strong><u><i>You can be listed as an Abductee in the film</i></u></strong>, get cool alien statues and even be in the film.  Even better you could have a movie poster with YOU on it!  If you can make it to the premiere, you can hang with the cast, walk the red carpet and help shed light on a 52 year old mystery.</li>
<li>These funds will supplement what we raise from private investors.  We have already received our first investors.  We will make this film, but we need to make it now,while the remaining eyewitnesses are still alive.  They deserve to see the truth revealed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quality First!</h3>
<p>We have built a first class team.  Our Director of Photography, Ellie Ann Fenton, is one of the best female cinematographers in the US.  She was chosen for her dedication, skill and creative vision. </p>
<p>Just watch this short film of her work: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/141050536"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://vimeo.com/141050536</a></p>
<p>You will be blown away.  This is the quality necessary to make this film work.</p>
<p>But the quality doesn't stop at the camera, it continues with the Musical team. <strong> Pulitzer nominated composer Luke Mayernik</strong>, a Pittsburgh native, will score the film.  </p>
<p>Hear his music at:<a href=""http://%C2%A0https://www.lukemmusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> https://www.lukemmusic.com/</a></p>
<p>But that is not all.  Famed songwriter <strong>Sandy Pickard</strong> will be writing the ""Ballad of John Murphy."" He has written songs for Cher, John Anderson, Tanya Tucker, Glen Campbell and Clint Eastwood.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.pinkardandbowden.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.pinkardandbowden.com/</a></p>
<p>We also have the incredible actress and singer<strong> Remington Moses</strong>, granddaughter of famed singer Ricky Nelson.  Remington will play Anne LeMaster, a radio station employee, who helps solve the mystery of Kecksburg.  </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/remingtonmoses/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/remingtonmoses/</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We can change an entire region and show our government that it cannot and should not lie to its citizens.  We also have a strong story of racial equality in the film.  Even Hillary Clinton could not get the government to tell the truth.   This film matters and our team has dedicated its time and money to bring it to life, but we need your help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our team has made successful films in the past like <i>Pro Wrestlers vs. Zombies</i>., but this film is not just about entertaining.  It is about bringing tourism to a region and shedding light on the truth. </li>
<li>Our Director Cody Knotts owned a newspaper for a decade that helped three wrongly-accused men get off death row.  <i><strong>He will not compromise on the story </strong></i>and<i><strong> he is not afraid</strong></i>.  But our entire team needs your help.  </li>
<li>We will donate the spaceship to the Kecksburg Fire Department to help drive tourism to the region.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>What if we don't have enough money?  The quality will suffer, the impact will be lessened, and the government will be able to continue to hide the truth.  <u><strong>But we will make this film!</strong></u></p>
<ul><li>How will we overcome the obstacles for the film? By hard work, focus and dedication.  We have worked for a year without pay to make this film a reality.  We need your help in exchange for cool shirts, spaceships and great experiences to make this happen.  </li></ul>
<h3>Money well spent</h3>
<p>As part of the commitment to quality, we have enlisted quality people at every level.  Most importantly, the money raised for the film must be handled properly.  That falls on our Line Producer, Tom Flickinger.  His background and reputation in finance is impeccable. </p>
<p>You can find his background at: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tflickinger/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/tflickinger/</a></p>

<h3>Why West Virginia?  Why Preston County?</h3>
<p>West Virginia has a highly competitive film tax credit at 31%. That tax credit will help your money be more effective.  Northern West Virginia is part of the Pittsburgh Metro area and both areas benefit from this project.  </p>
<p>Preston County was chosen for two reasons.  1. It is extremely close to the Mt. Pleasant/Kecksburg area.  We wanted to be as close as possible so that people from the Kecksburg community could participate easily.  2. Our director comes from the first settlers of Preston County.  His family lived there from the 1740 to the 1930s.  He wanted to give back to a region that gave so much to this family and himself.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can share this campaign, spread the word, ask your friends to donate.  This campaign is built to make the rewards hard to pass up.  Is the truth worth $100?  To solve a mystery forever?  To make a film that will change lives in a region?  $100 to change lives, to reveal the truth and to tell the government QUIT LYING.  </p>
<ul>
<li>This is a marathon, not a sprint.  We need 30 days of sharing, donating early, and getting friends to be part of this.  </li>
<li>Share on FB, Instagram, Twitter. Contact the local media.  Make this happen.</li>
</ul>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3><strong>What is the budget for the film? </strong></h3>
<p>Our projected budget is $420,000.  $126,900 is above the line, actors, travel, hotels and food.  Nearly 20% is for one actor to play President LBJ, who cannot name at this time.  LBJ is an important part of the story.  The other actors, men and women leads, are all being paid the same.  We are committed to equality amongst actors.</p>
<h3>Why are the rewards so late?</h3>
<p>Our plan is to send the majority of the rewards before filming, but those tied to the DVD will be later.  We don't believe in overpromising and under delivering, just the opposite.  Our plan is to send the T-Shirts and cool items (including statues) as soon as possible and before filming. </p>
<h3>What is different about your film?</h3>
<p>We built it on community support.  We have went to the public, met with them in person and sought to inspire them.  The arts should not be confined with LA and New York.  Rural Appalachia has a long history of art and culture.  We want to make that accessible to the residents of these communities.  </p>
<h3>I have sent to crowd funding before but never received anything, why is this different?</h3>
<p>Bluntly, this is not our first film.  We have built a team of filmmakers and community activists to make this film come alive.  High quality individuals from all walks of life dedicated to keeping our word to you.  </p>

This feature film will help drive interest and solve a 52 year old mystery.  The US government has refused to tell the truth, even to the Clintons.  What is so secret that even they can't know?  But to expose the truth, we can't just depend on traditional film financing, we need your help.

I'm Cody Knotts, an award-winning producer (Most Anticipated Horror Film of 2015 from Horror Society) who has worked with famed actors Roddy Piper, Doug Bradley and Kurt Angle, among others.  
The public deserves to know the truth about Kecksburg. Our government has no right to continue to hide the truth.  Even Hillary Clinton can't get the records, but this feature film can help keep Kecksburg in the public eye.  Even more important, this film can help drive tourism to the Pittsburgh region and Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. Roswell gets $95 million annually and Kecksburg nearly nothing.  
Are you tired of your government lying to you?  Then join our fight, help us make this film.  Help us expose the truth.  
Do you care about Pittsburgh?  Would you like to help change a region for the better?  
Films are forever.  They last beyond our lifetimes.  This is our chance to tell a story that has fascinated the public for decades.  Bryant Gumble, Ancient Aliens, Unsolved Mysteries and the History Channel  have all investigated Kecksburg but no one has brought the legend to life, until now.  We need your help and we want you to be a part of the legend.

Pittsburgh Roswell
Roswell generates $95 million annually, Kecksburg nearly nothing.  Although Kecksburg has more documentation, more witnesses and more mystery... it has never been commercialized.  This film is the key element in changing that dynamic, both shedding a light on the truth and jump starting the local economy of Pittsburgh, the Laurel Highlands, Westmoreland, Somerset and Fayette Counties.
As part of these efforts, we are working with local political leaders to bring this film to life. In addition, local Pittsburgh stars like Curt Wootton (Pittsburgh Dad), Shane Douglas (5 time world wrestling champion) and Richard John Walters (My Bloody Valentine 3D) are all part of the cast.
We have agreed to donate props and the spaceship designed by former CMU graduate Dr. Fuzzy Mauldin to the Kecksburg Fire Department for the creation of a museum dedicated to Kecksburg.

What We Need & What You Get
We need funding from you to ensure artistic integrity.  With a film that threatens to expose the truth about our Government's lies, we need you more than ever.  Every level of donation to this film includes cool rewards.  Our goal was to give you stuff that we would want if we were donating.

Films need money, period pieces need even more.  Our lead actors are all working for the same day rate (other than some specific cameos).  Why? Because everyone in this film is dedicated to revealing the truth about Kecksburg.  But for the film to work, we need to be able to film for at least a month.  The more money we raise, the more time to film to make the story incredible.  
Our Aliens and Spaceship designs are being made by Morgantown, WV High School Art students from designs by famed founder of Lycos Michael ""Fuzzy"" Mauldin, one of the inventors of the Search Engine.  Not only do you get the coolest spaceship sculpture but you help inspire young people in rural West Virginia to become artists. 

You can be listed as an Abductee in the film, get cool alien statues and even be in the film.  Even better you could have a movie poster with YOU on it!  If you can make it to the premiere, you can hang with the cast, walk the red carpet and help shed light on a 52 year old mystery.
These funds will supplement what we raise from private investors.  We have already received our first investors.  We will make this film, but we need to make it now,while the remaining eyewitnesses are still alive.  They deserve to see the truth revealed.

Quality First!
We have built a first class team.  Our Director of Photography, Ellie Ann Fenton, is one of the best female cinematographers in the US.  She was chosen for her dedication, skill and creative vision. 
Just watch this short film of her work: https://vimeo.com/141050536
You will be blown away.  This is the quality necessary to make this film work.
But the quality doesn't stop at the camera, it continues with the Musical team.  Pulitzer nominated composer Luke Mayernik, a Pittsburgh native, will score the film.  
Hear his music at: https://www.lukemmusic.com/
But that is not all.  Famed songwriter Sandy Pickard will be writing the ""Ballad of John Murphy."" He has written songs for Cher, John Anderson, Tanya Tucker, Glen Campbell and Clint Eastwood.
http://www.pinkardandbowden.com/
We also have the incredible actress and singer Remington Moses, granddaughter of famed singer Ricky Nelson.  Remington will play Anne LeMaster, a radio station employee, who helps solve the mystery of Kecksburg.

The Impact
We can change an entire region and show our government that it cannot and should not lie to its citizens.  We also have a strong story of racial equality in the film.  Even Hillary Clinton could not get the government to tell the truth.   This film matters and our team has dedicated its time and money to bring it to life, but we need your help.

Our team has made successful films in the past like Pro Wrestlers vs. Zombies., but this film is not just about entertaining.  It is about bringing tourism to a region and shedding light on the truth. 
Our Director Cody Knotts owned a newspaper for a decade that helped three wrongly-accused men get off death row.  He will not compromise on the story and he is not afraid.  But our entire team needs your help.  
We will donate the spaceship to the Kecksburg Fire Department to help drive tourism to the region.


Risks & Challenges
What if we don't have enough money?  The quality will suffer, the impact will be lessened, and the government will be able to continue to hide the truth.  But we will make this film!
How will we overcome the obstacles for the film? By hard work, focus and dedication.  We have worked for a year without pay to make this film a reality.  We need your help in exchange for cool shirts, spaceships and great experiences to make this happen.  
Money well spent
As part of the commitment to quality, we have enlisted quality people at every level.  Most importantly, the money raised for the film must be handled properly.  That falls on our Line Producer, Tom Flickinger.  His background and reputation in finance is impeccable. 
You can find his background at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tflickinger/

Why West Virginia?  Why Preston County?
West Virginia has a highly competitive film tax credit at 31%. That tax credit will help your money be more effective.  Northern West Virginia is part of the Pittsburgh Metro area and both areas benefit from this project.  
Preston County was chosen for two reasons.  1. It is extremely close to the Mt. Pleasant/Kecksburg area.  We wanted to be as close as possible so that people from the Kecksburg community could participate easily.  2. Our director comes from the first settlers of Preston County.  His family lived there from the 1740 to the 1930s.  He wanted to give back to a region that gave so much to this family and himself.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
You can share this campaign, spread the word, ask your friends to donate.  This campaign is built to make the rewards hard to pass up.  Is the truth worth $100?  To solve a mystery forever?  To make a film that will change lives in a region?  $100 to change lives, to reveal the truth and to tell the government QUIT LYING.  

This is a marathon, not a sprint.  We need 30 days of sharing, donating early, and getting friends to be part of this.  
Share on FB, Instagram, Twitter. Contact the local media.  Make this happen.

FAQ
What is the budget for the film? 
Our projected budget is $420,000.  $126,900 is above the line, actors, travel, hotels and food.  Nearly 20% is for one actor to play President LBJ, who cannot name at this time.  LBJ is an important part of the story.  The other actors, men and women leads, are all being paid the same.  We are committed to equality amongst actors.
Why are the rewards so late?
Our plan is to send the majority of the rewards before filming, but those tied to the DVD will be later.  We don't believe in overpromising and under delivering, just the opposite.  Our plan is to send the T-Shirts and cool items (including statues) as soon as possible and before filming. 
What is different about your film?
We built it on community support.  We have went to the public, met with them in person and sought to inspire them.  The arts should not be confined with LA and New York.  Rural Appalachia has a long history of art and culture.  We want to make that accessible to the residents of these communities.  
I have sent to crowd funding before but never received anything, why is this different?
Bluntly, this is not our first film.  We have built a team of filmmakers and community activists to make this film come alive.  High quality individuals from all walks of life dedicated to keeping our word to you.  
How long have you been working on this?
A year without pay or reward.  We wanted this film to be as complete as possible before bringing it to you and investors.  Why should you support a half-baked idea?  You shouldn't.  
For you to support our efforts, we knew it would take an army and a project worth supporting.  From Museums, community activists and high school students at Morgantown High, we have built that army.  But it needs your support.
