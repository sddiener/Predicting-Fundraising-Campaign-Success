<p>This is our continued Campaign to raise the funds for Missoula's first Pakistani food truck. The original campaign raised $10,000, which would all be used towards the purchase of the food truck. Any additional funds raised through this second attempt, would be added to the original amount. As most food trailers start from about $25,000, we hope to raise enough funds to at least acquire the most important and expensive equipment to start operation. </p>
<p>We have also been in contact with local media outlets, and we hope the exposure from that would help spread the word and get the community to chip in to help bring this dream to fruition.</p>
<p><u><strong>Introduction</strong></u></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Zohair Bajwa. I was born and raised in Lahore, Pakistan, and have been in Missoula since 2006. My friends and family will all tell you how much I enjoy sharing my culture through food – sharing the distinct tastes and smells of home with the people I love. Because of this, I have decided to embark on a new, exciting, and delicious endeavor – bringing the tastes of authentic Pakistani food to the Missoula community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope to bring Lahore’s authentic street food to the streets of Missoula and the surrounding area. My wife Megan and I are looking into securing a food trailer in which to prepare and serve up some delicious Pakistani food to tantalize your taste buds and keep you coming back for more. This is where your support and generosity comes in, and please allow me to thank you up front.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Community and Food</strong></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ever since I came to Missoula in 2006 as a student at the University of Montana, there has always been something missing for me – good curries, and, more specifically, Pakistani food.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was deeply honored to have the chance to cook for my community through the United We Eat (“UWE”) program through Soft Landing Missoula last year. It was such a humbling experience – to see the excitement the Missoula community displayed for authentic Pakistani food. We ended up selling out 150 meals!</p>

<p><a href=""https://bit.ly/2IrA0xs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://bit.ly/2IrA0xs</a></p>
<p>I plan to bring the same love and passion to my food trailer as I did for the UWE program, and you can expect no compromises when it comes to using authentic spices and recipes, resulting in a whole new world of flavors for you to enjoy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eventually, once we are up and running and have firm footing in the Missoula food scene, we plan to give back to our Missoula neighbors, either by specials or discounted/free meals for various ones in the community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>What Foods to Expect</strong></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Megan and I have had several conversations about a menu we believe would best bring the tastes of Lahore to the people of Missoula. During our trip home earlier this year, we explored different flavors that we think would work best to introduce to our community here. We will initially be serving:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Chicken Karahi</strong>: traditionally cooked in a wok with tomatoes and spices, simmered to a thick sauce. Served best with naan and kachumar* (keto-friendly)</p>
<p><strong>Daal</strong>: orange lentils perfectly cooked to a stew-like consistency. Prepared with spices and served best over rice or naan (vegan, vegetarian friendly)</p>
<p><strong>Samosa</strong>: everyone knows about these delicious, fried concoctions!</p>
<p><strong>Paratha Rolls</strong>: a traditional grab-and-go street food from Pakistan. Chicken or vegetables cooked in spices, mixed with kachumar*, mint and tamarind chutneys, wrapped in a crispy paratha (fry bread).</p>
<p><strong>Shakar</strong> <strong>Qandi</strong>: My wife’s favorite snack in Lahore! Sweet potato mixed with freshly squeezed orange and spices. Traditionally served over newspaper (we won’t be doing that here, obviously – hello health code violation), and toothpicks.</p>
<p>*<strong>Kachumar</strong>: sliced raw onions, raw tomatoes mixed with fresh lemon/lime juice, cilantro, salt and black pepper. A perfect accompaniment to any of the above-listed meals.</p>
<p><strong>Chutneys</strong>: Spicy mint chutney and a sweet and tangy tamarind chutney.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>What You Get for Helping Fund This Project</strong></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Besides having a local spot where you can try the delicious tastes of traditional and authentic Pakistani food, adding to Missoula’s food and cultural diversity, you can expect the listed rewards.</p>
<p>For any donations received from outside of Missoula area and if you cannot visit us when we're open, we will do our best to get your T-shirts mailed to you as soon we are able to. Also, if and when you're in Missoula, please come say hi and we will take care of you the only way we know- Pakistani hospitality style. For catering donations, we can certainly schedule a date where you will be in Missoula and would like to take advantage of that perk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Obviously, there is always a risk of failure, and to be honest, that risk is part of the reason why I have shied away from this endeavor until now. But I believe now is the time to make my dream a reality – now is the time for Missoula to experience authentic Pakistani food that is rich in flavor, made with love, and warms the soul.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During these extraordinary times in which we find ourselves, I understand that not everyone is able to contribute financially to this project. However, I would be very thankful for your support, encouragement, and patronage when we do open. I hope the people of Missoula are as excited as Megan and I are for this project, and I hope you will show your support by opening your hearts and your wallets to make this a success and help us add something new to your dining options!</p>

Community and Food
 
Ever since I came to Missoula in 2006 as a student at the University of Montana, there has always been something missing for me – good curries, and, more specifically, Pakistani food.
 
I was deeply honored to have the chance to cook for my community through the United We Eat (“UWE”) program through Soft Landing Missoula last year.

Most of my background is in retail and restaurant management with a lot of knowledge in the health food and nutrition market. I have spent the last six years managing three restaurants in Ottawa. These three restaurants have a grown significantly financially in the last five years as well. While managing these three restaurants I have also had the opportunity to test the market with the products I would like Vegan Desires to carry including the organic juices, the vegan coffee beverages and vegan desserts and was very successful at doing so. With my success I believe I am ready to bring the full concept to Ottawa in my very own location and that Ottawa is ready for this and will be another hang out for Vegans, Vegetarians and health conscious people alike. </li>
<li>My campaign is to raise funds to open a fully  vegan juice bar and cafe in Ottawa which will also be fully licensed to serve cocktails and other alcoholic beverages.  Vegan Desires Juice Bar and Cafe will have a lot of vegan sweets and snacks, vegan coffee and non-caffeinated beverages, gluten-free options and juices as well as smoothies and cocktails, cocktails, and other alcoholic beverages. . The juice bar will also have an option for use of organic produce. As part of an initiative to maintain a green business, people who bring in their own cups, or mugs will receive a discount. A loyalty card will be in place to share our appreciation for our loyal customers.  Vegan Desires will also host board game nights and live bands on a weekly basis. The reason Vegan Desires Juice bar and Cafe is so important to me is because I have always had the desire to open a vegan juice bar and cafe in Ottawa where people can just sit down and relax and enjoy some vegan snacks and refreshments. Ottawa is a great city and the amount of not only vegans and vegetarians in Ottawa but as well as health conscious people in the city and even Canada as a whole is booming. That being said, there is a market for it and will help how people view the traditional run off the mill juice bar and cafe and will be the new hot spot for everyone who just wants to relax and grab a ""vegan one"". </li> <li>Contributors to this campaign will help me achieves my goals and life time dreams of opening Ottawa's first and only vegan juice bar and cafe which includes gluten- free options and option for organic produce for smoothies and juices. </li> </ul> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>I will need need to raise $60 000 a long withy my savings  as part of my crowd funding campaign in order to open Vegan Desires Juice Bar and Cafe. The $60 000 dollars will go towards: first and last month's rent, a few commercial blenders, commercial juicers, commercial espresso maker, commercial coffee maker, grab &amp; go display, commercial fridge and freezer, a commercial dishwasher, inventory, and lastly the renovations and furnishings of the juice bar and cafe. </li>
<li> There are a lot of unique perks for people who choose to donate to this amazing campaign that would bring Ottawa's first and only vegan juice bar and cafe to life. These perks include:</li>

<li>If I do not reach my funding goal I will seek an angel investor or a business loan to cover the difference.  In every way possible I would like to see Vegan Desires Juice bar and Cafe sweep the nation's capital off its feet and give Ottawa health nuts and non-health nuts a like the much needed vegan cafe and juice bar.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>My project and quest to open Vegan Desires Juice Bar and Cafe which would be a fully lisenced vegan juice bar and cafe stems from not only a passion for healthy food, exercise and nutrition but a longing for a place where people can also enjoy not only vegan options but organic and gluten-free options as well. The reason this project is valuable to the contributors and to the world is because many people are against consuming animal products as a choice in order to not support cruelty to animals and instead choose a vegan diet to live a  ""cruelty-free life"". As well, many people choose a vegan diet due to dietary restriction that involve lactose intolerance and allergy to eggs amongst the dislike of consuming meat. Vegan Desires Juice Bar and Cafe will also be a host to gluten-free products because there are many that suffer from celiac disease and there bodies are not able to process gluten and must stay away from such foods that contain wheat and barley. Giving customers the option for organic produce not only helps the environment, but as well the customer as well as organic is the cleaner way to go as it is GMO free and free from pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals often found in conventional foods and are harmful to our bodies. Vegan Desires Juice Bar and Cafe will also have an excellent composting and recycling program in place and will classify itself as a green business. Compost and recycling bins will be placed in the store and we will ensure that we have as little of a eco footprint as possible. As well, customers who bring in their own mug, cup, glass, or protein shaker will receive a discount on their beverage. Customers that bring in their own reusable plate will receive a discount on the snack foods. There will also be a loyalty card in place to reward our valued customers. The project is valuable to both the contributor and the world because not not only does this value the health and prosperity of the contributor, customers and the world, but as well it minimizes the eco foot because no animal products are being used and a great recycling and compost program will be put in place to ensure that it remains a green business. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I fully believe in my vision for Vegan Desires Juice Bar and Cafe and fully understand I am stepping into a very competitive space with many unforeseen obstacles to come. However,  I am putting my diploma in business and humanities degree to good use a long with my years of retail and restaurant management experience. I will also be turning to my fellow vegan friends for mentorship as they have agreed to help me and I know they will be there to help me every step of the way along side my family and many other friends. I will also seek mentorship from my brother who is successfully running three restaurants and my good friend in St.Catharines, Ontario  that has her Gluten-Free business. </p>
<p>Even though I am in a competitive space and will be competing against other coffee shops and juice bars  I know that Ottawa residents especially vegans and vegetarians will enjoy having a  juice bar and cafe offering vegan, gluten -free and organic choices. Vegan Desires will also be fully licensed and will offer vegan cocktails, mocktails and organic, gluten-free alcoholic beverages.  This will not only differentiate me from the traditional cafes and juice bars, but will also lead to my success as people want change and more people each day are seeking not only vegan and gluten free options, but organic as well. As well, a lot of vegans and vegetarians are always on the look out for a nice place where they can enjoy vegan beverages and snacks. </p>

Even though I am in a competitive space and will be competing against other coffee shops and juice bars  I know that Ottawa residents especially vegans and vegetarians will enjoy having a  juice bar and cafe offering vegan, gluten -free and organic choices. Vegan Desires will also be fully licensed and will offer vegan cocktails, mocktails and organic, gluten-free alcoholic beverages.  This will not only differentiate me from the traditional cafes and juice bars, but will also lead to my success as people want change and more people each day are seeking not only vegan and gluten free options, but organic as well. As well, a lot of vegans and vegetarians are always on the look out for a nice place where they can enjoy vegan beverages and snacks.

<h3>The Market</h3>
<p>In a hectic city such as London, people don’t usually get much time to look after themselves when it comes to healthy eating habits.</p>
<p>People are constantly trying to lose weight, build lean mass or simply have a balanced diet.</p>
<p>Finotaste was designed to offer customers customised meal programs to help them achieve their goals.</p>
<p>We aim at delivering customers full of flavour, natural, superfoods that will bring pleasure to their table.</p>
<p>Weight loss represents over 70% of the market and shows no signs of slowing down.  It is largely fueled by women ranging from twenty-year-olds to forty-year-olds. Men also seek fat loss but also usually opt for personalised fitness programs as well. The fitness and wellbeing market is a smaller slice but it consists of people who can immediately understand the benefits of our programs.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Quick, Flavorful, Hot and On-the-Go....... This is how a large percentage of coffee drinkers consume their daily cup of coffee.  </p>
<p>Hello, my name is Donna Royston, founder of CoffeeStixx.  On a recent flight, I noticed several passengers struggling through various different condiments to create the ""perfect"" cup of coffee. I quickly recognized how valuable it would be to have a pre-measured option for consumers who just wanted that perfect cup of coffee on the go without having to visit an expensive coffee house to do so.  </p>
<p>I recently launched a new product that combines the benefits of four products into one, saving consumers both time and money. CoffeeStix will add to the convenience of your coffee drinking experience by allowing consumers to cream, flavor, sweeten, and stir their coffee that is perfectly prepared up in 90 seconds or less.   </p>
<p>CoffeeStix, like the name suggests, starts with a stick dressed with with a candy like substance on the end. Our solid solution houses the flavoring and sweetener in addition to including a non-dairy creamer. While it is dissolving consumers also enjoy the convenience of having the coffee stirrer readily available.</p>
<p>CoffeeStix comes in an assortment of flavors including French Vanilla, Hazelnut, Chocolate Mousse, Salted Caramel and seasonal varieties like Pumpkin Spice, Vanilla Caramel. and Chocolate Peppermint.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Quick, Flavorful, Hot and On-the-Go....... This is how a large percentage of coffee drinkers consume their daily cup of coffee.  
Hello, my name is Donna Royston, founder of CoffeeStixx.  On a recent flight, I noticed several passengers struggling through various different condiments to create the ""perfect"" cup of coffee. I quickly recognized how valuable it would be to have a pre-measured option for consumers who just wanted that perfect cup of coffee on the go without having to visit an expensive coffee house to do so.  
I recently launched a new product that combines the benefits of four products into one, saving consumers both time and money. CoffeeStix will add to the convenience of your coffee drinking experience by allowing consumers to cream, flavor, sweeten, and stir their coffee that is perfectly prepared up in 90 seconds or less.   
CoffeeStix, like the name suggests, starts with a stick dressed with with a candy like substance on the end. Our solid solution houses the flavoring and sweetener in addition to including a non-dairy creamer. While it is dissolving consumers also enjoy the convenience of having the coffee stirrer readily available.
CoffeeStix comes in an assortment of flavors including French Vanilla, Hazelnut, Chocolate Mousse, Salted Caramel and seasonal varieties like Pumpkin Spice, Vanilla Caramel. and Chocolate Peppermint.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Company Deep River Distillers, LLC                                           Founder Paul Grabek</p>
<p>July 4, 2013 is a pivotal date; not only because we celebrate America's independence krew Vodka was born. several family members remarked how difficult it was to find commercially made Wisniowka; a cherry flavored vodka often enjoyed on Christmas Eve by the Polish. I, Paul Grabek founder of Krew Vodka, offered a solution to privately distill, small batches of a cherry flavored vodka for all to enjoy on Christmas Eve.  Falling back on my chemist work experience,  I settled on a formulation that I believed was very close to the original cherry favored Wisniowka. Much to my delight and a blind taste test on Christmas Eve 2013, the home made Wisniowka was the resounding winner. With this confidence boost,  I began experimenting with various vodka mash bases including Potato, Corn and Wheat. The winning mash is corn - gluten free! The resulting product was added to the distillation flask and distilled in the standard fashion. The ethanol was treated to remove various impurities. The resulting pure ethanol (180 proof) was diluted down to 80 proof with filtered water and then bottled. The entire process is truly enjoyable and understanding the chemistry behind  the distillation fuels my passion. I simply love to watch the entire process unfold.  Of course, focus group and sampling efforts have taken place - reaching over 700 people! And their feedback has been instrumental in preparing me to launch this campaign.</p>
<p>Krew vodka was awarded it's first accolade in the 2017 at the ADI (American Distillers Institute) craft distillers competition. And received a Bronze Award in the national competition!</p>
<p>The branding, marketing and packaging are complete. We are now looking  to scale up the project to bring this product to the local market starting in Connecticut.</p>
<p>My goal is to share Krew vodka with the world; and I need your help to help make my dream a reality. By contributing to my passion project, you will be a part of my company and fulfill an entrepreneur's dream. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for serious Round One investors to help with operational fees, securing the commercial manufacturing plant, distilling equipment (i.e. fermentation tanks, bottling equipment) and overhead (i.e. rent, utilities, advertising, events).  We are looking to raise $500,000 in working capital by November 2018 in preparation for a soft, local market product launch in January 2019. Hard launch is planned for Q2'19.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Krew Vodka  will be one of the first domestic (made in the US ) ultra premium vodkas planned to hit the local Connecticut market in January 2019. Our single distillation process produces an exceptionally smooth tasting and clear hand-crafted, naked vodka. It is produced, distilled and bottled along the Connecticut coastline.  </li>
<li>Krew vodka, the flagship product of Deep River Distillers, LLC.,  has already won its first accolade in the 2017 ADI  (American Distillers Institute ) craft distillers competition. And received a Bronze Award in the national competition! </li>
<li>We have 9 years of distillation experience. We come at this project from the point of view of a chemist, who understands the distillation process.  We also have over 20 years of sales and marketing experience.  We have scaled up several  products from bench  to pilot plant and production level. We have the Knowledge, Skill, Experience and Passion to bring this produce to the market.</li>
<li>We invite you to join our crew to help bring Krew to the market. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk is brand recognition and penetrating the market.  Currently, Krew vodka does not have a strong brand awareness as it's in its infancy. With the campaign goal of $500,000 we will focus on grass root  and social media outreach efforts to begin sharing Krew. From there, broader marketing/advertising efforts will include hand distributing to local bars, restaurants, hotels and catering companies. We are also entering local taste testing events to introduce are vodka to the local Connecticut market before launching globally.  Once the the business is up and running, we will be hosting distillery tours and will have a tasting room which will be open to the general public.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>You dont have to contribute to the funding to be apart of Deep Rivers Distillers, LLC to support and be part of the team.  We value your suggestions and support for new products and ideas.  If you have tried our vodka  we invite to you to post a review on our website  Krewvodka.com.  Thank you for your support and encouragement.</li>

<h3>Meet CREATE Gallery &amp; Cocktail Lounge:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s been six years since our first <strong><a href=""http://www.create-boston.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CREATE</a> </strong>event. What started as a simple idea. An idea rooted in collaboration, community and celebration. A celebration of art, food, music and drink on a level playing field. A showcase of Boston’s brightest artists, chefs, bartenders and musicians.</p>
<p>Today we evolve from event to brick &amp; mortar. CREATE Gallery &amp; Cocktail Lounge is opening this fall in Union Sq, Somerville at <strong><a href=""http://www.bowmarketsomerville.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bow Market</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Our mission statement has always been the same.<strong> Develop a larger platform for artists</strong>. Create a catalyst to show how much talent we have here. Talents that struggle to find notoriety. Talents worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>For six years we’ve given these artists an opportunity for 3-4 hours, one day each year. This fall we’ll be able to give them residencies in our space year round. This is a major accomplishment for our brand but we need your help. We need your support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About CREATE Gallery &amp; Cocktail:</strong></p>
<p>Our space will be (trying to find the right word for small) charming. Our calendar will be filled with 45-60 day residencies for our artists. We’ll program themes and collaborations. We’ll make all the art available for sale. Originals &amp; prints. We’ll highlight our artists through our social media, providing you with insight into who they are, what they do and when to find them at the gallery.</p>
<p>And we’ll serve up cocktails. All draft cocktails. Our cocktails will be unique collaborations with the best bartenders in Boston and friends from around the country. And of course, we’ll always have an offering from Tavern Road in the memory of Ryan McGrale. We know you miss the Down n’ Brown and Bees Knees.</p>
<p>We’ll provide the music and host the party every night. Stop by one of the many food kiosks on the ground floor of Bow Market and bring up snacks. We can fit about 20 people so plan on bringing friends and making a few more before you leave.</p>
<p>I’ve worked in kitchens my whole life. Ingredients and products were my passion. We formed culinary teams and built family in our restaurants. CREATE Gallery &amp; Cocktail will follow this blueprint bringing artists together to develop a community of incredible talent and inspiration.</p>
<p>We’re counting on family, friends, fans of CREATE, the restaurant community &amp; anyone who understands the immeasurable value artists provide our world to contribute to our campaign.</p>
<p>“Creativity takes courage” Let’s support that…..</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Well is a place for people to <strong>come together for herbal drinks, food, kava, and tea in North Oakland</strong>.  We believe deeply that <strong>food is medicine</strong> and are working to re-ignite the collective wisdom of our ancestors and to put this traditional knowledge back in the hands of the people. We do this by serving delicious drinks and food, working with small local farmers, hosting educational workshops, and offering everything at affordable prices. <strong>The Well is now under new ownership, and we are planning to reopen on August 1st, 2018.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>What is staying the same?</strong></h3>
<p>I am planning to continue many aspects of The Well business as was run by the previous owner Marielle. I hope to continue stewarding beloved community and I am committed to<strong> keeping the space as accessible, diverse, and inclusive as possible for all folks.</strong> Herbal drinks and eats will still be the focus of The Well, as reflected in our new menu. We will also continue to offer <strong>workshop space</strong> for community teachings. It will continue to be a <strong>kid friendly</strong><strong> zone</strong> with toys and high chairs easily available. We will continue to source our <strong>ingredients from sustainable and ethical sources </strong>and strive to be as local and organic as possible. We will continue to pay our employees<strong> fair wages </strong>and offer benefits.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528764561/vy3m6eqicvmpzodyoowb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>What is changing?</strong></h3>
<p>We will be creating <strong>a retail line of organic Chinese teas, drinking chocolate, and golden milk</strong>. We will have a space for tea ceremonies. We will also be adding <strong>kava</strong> to our menu. Kava is a root from the Pacific Islands that has relaxing and socializing effects. With the addition of kava and our hopes of being an <strong>alternative nightlife lounge</strong>, we will be expanding our hours to Mondays-Fridays 9am-midnight, Saturdays 9am-6pm with select special evening events, and Sundays 9am-9pm. We will also offer one “karma bowl” and “karma drink” per day. These will be <strong>“pay what you can” meals in order to keep healthy food accessible to the entire community</strong>. The karma bowls will be rotating rice bowls with fresh greens, vegetarian proteins, and culinary herbs. The karma drinks will be rotating herbal teas served hot or cold. We will also be adding a cold case for grab-and-go items. Additionally, we will be adding <strong>weekly community events, such as open mics, art nights, and curated workshops.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>What Are You Funding?</strong></h3>
<p>I have already committed $90,000 of my personal saving to the buying of the business. We need around $24,000 more to implement some incredible changes listed below. My hope is to avoid high-interest bank loans and instead try out this alternative model of crowdfunding. Thank you for participating in the next economy. </p>

The Well is a place for people to come together for herbal drinks, food, kava, and tea in North Oakland.  We believe deeply that food is medicine and are working to re-ignite the collective wisdom of our ancestors and to put this traditional knowledge back in the hands of the people. We do this by serving delicious drinks and food, working with small local farmers, hosting educational workshops, and offering everything at affordable prices. The Well is now under new ownership, and we are planning to reopen on August 1st, 2018.
What is staying the same?
I am planning to continue many aspects of The Well business as was run by the previous owner Marielle. I hope to continue stewarding beloved community and I am committed to keeping the space as accessible, diverse, and inclusive as possible for all folks. Herbal drinks and eats will still be the focus of The Well, as reflected in our new menu. We will also continue to offer workshop space for community teachings. It will continue to be a kid friendly zone with toys and high chairs easily available. We will continue to source our ingredients from sustainable and ethical sources and strive to be as local and organic as possible. We will continue to pay our employees fair wages and offer benefits.

What is changing?
We will be creating a retail line of organic Chinese teas, drinking chocolate, and golden milk. We will have a space for tea ceremonies. We will also be adding kava to our menu. Kava is a root from the Pacific Islands that has relaxing and socializing effects. With the addition of kava and our hopes of being an alternative nightlife lounge, we will be expanding our hours to Mondays-Fridays 9am-midnight, Saturdays 9am-6pm with select special evening events, and Sundays 9am-9pm. We will also offer one “karma bowl” and “karma drink” per day. These will be “pay what you can” meals in order to keep healthy food accessible to the entire community. The karma bowls will be rotating rice bowls with fresh greens, vegetarian proteins, and culinary herbs. The karma drinks will be rotating herbal teas served hot or cold. We will also be adding a cold case for grab-and-go items. Additionally, we will be adding weekly community events, such as open mics, art nights, and curated workshops.
What Are You Funding?
I have already committed $90,000 of my personal saving to the buying of the business. We need around $24,000 more to implement some incredible changes listed below. My hope is to avoid high-interest bank loans and instead try out this alternative model of crowdfunding. Thank you for participating in the next economy.

<h3>HOTPLATE SOUTHERN KITCHEN</h3>
<p>Owners T.R. and Mya Burns have been in the restaurant industry for over several years and each restaurant has drawn people from all over the country. The head chef TR Burns began cooking for family and friends which then turned into the strangers turned family.

<p>Being a contributor to this campaign will add so much value to the Lehigh Valley and surrounding areas. Throughout the years we have had some challenges with chosen locations, irreconcilable landlords, and staffing failures.

Today, we have re-evaluated our past mistakes, researched our market, considered our cost-effectiveness and consulted with a financial strategist to ensure success.  Our food was never an issue therefore we are pressing on and moving forward. And we have begun the final steps in securing a property that will not only help us create Great food met the high demand of out food and expand our Vegan soul Company which feature our vegan soul food dishes.</p>

Owners T.R. and Mya Burns have been in the restaurant industry for over several years and each restaurant has drawn people from all over the country. The head chef TR Burns began cooking for family and friends which then turned into the strangers turned family. Hot Plate Southern means so much to the owners because hands down if you have had our fried chicken you would say the same thing. We are originators in all we do from fried chicken to vegan dishes.

Being a contributor to this campaign will add so much value to the Lehigh Valley and surrounding areas. Throughout the years we have had some challenges with chosen locations, irreconcilable landlords, and staffing failures. Honestly, some of this created a financial hardship as a business and tough decisions had to be made. Today, we have re-evaluated our past mistakes, researched our market, considered our cost-effectiveness and consulted with a financial strategist to ensure success.  Our food was never an issue therefore we are pressing on and moving forward. And we have begun the final steps in securing a property that will not only help us create Great food met the high demand of out food and expand our Vegan soul Company which feature our vegan soul food dishes.

As a contributor, you will help us expand within a new location and properly staff to the best of our ability and become a part of the community. We are an entrepreneurial driven people that love to see others succeed in the marketplace, we also understand it takes a village build and that's where you come in. At Hotplate Southern Kitchen you are bound to come in and feel like welcomed family. Our motto is Eat, Dream, Laugh & Believe.

What We Need & What You Get
We have some perks for you just to thank you for your contribution. We understand you have to believe in what you buy so we want to give you something for your belief and trust in us going forward and not disappointing.  Your contribution will go to the new location, décor, funding for equipment and of course all original events, themes, and entertainment.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi there! Thanks for stopping by our Indiegogo campaign. </p>
<p>We're Karyn and Scott Adamson; the husband and wife team behind Gaslight. <strong>Scott is the creative sign maker</strong> who has been working for the past 5 years producing handcrafted, historically inspired signage with Gaslight Sign Co. <strong>Karyn is the bubbly barista </strong>with a background in Business and Professional Photography. Gaslight was originally started with nothing more than a rusty toolbox, old tools and a lot of ambition. 5 years later we have a dedicated workshop, a strong social media following and dozens of commercial projects under our belt. <strong>We're pretty good at turning nothing into something</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Coming Soon...</h3>
<p>Together, we're combining our individual skills to open a truly unique and one of a kind space: <strong>Gaslight Cafe &amp; Neon Sign Gallery</strong> in our friendly little town of Almonte, Ontario. The idea of a gallery &amp; cafe has been a dream of ours for a long time. We've been diligently saving all the while waiting for the stars to align on the perfect space. Recently, the opportunity to lease a historic retail space in the heart of Almonte came up, so we jumped at the chance. The space is in need of a lot of work, but we're no strangers to rolling up our sleeves and applying some elbow grease.</p>
<p>The space will serve as a gallery for Gaslight's original pieces of vintage inspired neon signs and artwork. It will also be a spot where people can come in and <strong>enjoy a drink and good food.</strong> Vibrant neon art, jukebox tunes, a hot coffee, a cold beer, comfort food, the warm afternoon sun, good friends and good humour. A place for visitors and locals alike. <strong>A gallery without pretension and a cafe that feels like home</strong>. We want to create the kind of place we'd want to visit everyday, and we're hoping you want to join us too.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Get Involved!</h3>
<p>We'd love for you, our friends and supporters to get involved and be apart of this exciting adventure in exchange for some pretty neat perks. With your contribution you will be apart of a <strong>first of it's kind local business</strong>. You will be helping support us to <strong>do what we love to do</strong>. Plus, if your locals you will get to come in and hang out with us in the cafe, that's pretty cool too, right?</p>

<p><strong>ENGLISH VERSION BELOW!</strong></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">""Unique, personnalisé, gourmand""</h3>
<p>""<strong>La Miam Factory</strong>"" est une jeune start-up belge fondée en 2016, composée de 7 membres. Nous proposons des produits <strong>personnalisables</strong> <strong>à la demande</strong>, grâce à des nouvelles technologies de précision encore <strong>inégalées </strong>: l'impression 3D ainsi que le marquage au laser. Nous utilisons du chocolat de couverture, d'origine belge, sans utilisation d'un quelconque additif.</p>
<p>Aujourd'hui, nous lançons ce crowdfunding afin que vous nous aidiez dans le développement de notre entreprise. Il a pour objectif  de vous proposer des <strong>chocolats conçus par vous et pour vous. </strong>Ceux-ci serviront de cadeaux gourmands et uniques pour les <b>fêtes de fin d'année</b>, mais qui peuvent aussi très bien servir pour d'autres événements plus spécifiques, tels que les anniversaires, mariages, et bien d'autres. </p>
<p>Nous croyons au mélange d'un des meilleurs chocolats, concocté par le chocolatier belge <strong>Darcis</strong>, associé à la personnalité et l'unicité que <strong>vous </strong>allez donner à votre chocolat. Voulez-vous y croire avec nous? </p>

<p>     4. ""<i>All-in-One</i>"": Ce pack est composé de TOUS les produits, et notamment <strong>des 3 types</strong> de ""Mixed Designs"" avec un message personnalisé pour chacun des produits! C'est le moyen idéal pour des cadeaux multiples lors de ces fêtes de fin d'année.</p>
<h3>En pratique</h3>
<p><strong>Après votre commande, c'est là que le jeu commence! Vous recevrez automatiquement un courrier électronique vous expliquant les étapes à suivre afin de nous envoyer votre photo, votre message, etc. à personnaliser. N'oubliez donc pas de consulter votre boîte aux lettres (même vos courriers indésirables) pour vous assurer de recevoir ces informations essentielles!</strong></p>
<p>La livraison aura lieu dans un point-relais qu'il vous sera communiqué <strong>entre le 16 et le 22 décembre,</strong> juste avant Noël !</p>
<h3>Ce que nous ferons de vos contributions</h3>
<p>Depuis 2016, de nombreuses améliorations ont été apportées à nos technologies. Aujourd'hui, grâce à votre soutien financier, nous poursuivrons l'amélioration de l'ensemble du processus de production, sur 5 points précis:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573139443/jib6uxpoxaquagr9kzts.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Premièrement, ces fonds nous aideront à acheter du matériel supplémentaire et de nouvelles machines. Ainsi, nous pourrons remplacer nos prototypes (déjà fonctionnels) par des <strong>machines plus robustes</strong>, améliorant par conséquent notre productivité.</li>
<li>Deuxièmement, nous avons besoin d’espace pour nos activités. Une partie conséquente des fonds récoltés par ce crowdfunding sera utilisée pour acquérir de nouveaux locaux.<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> Ils comprendront une zone de production, une zone de stockage et un bureau. De nature minimalistes, c’est tout ce dont nous avons besoin si nous voulons apporter le bonheur autour de nous avec nos produits.</span>
</li>
<li>Troisièmement, nous souhaitons mettre au point un système de transport/livraison sûr. Notre objectif est de vous fournir des produits <strong>dans un parfait état</strong>. En effet, ils sont très fragiles et les sociétés de transport traditionnelles ne nous conviennent pas encore.</li>
<li><p>De plus, nous travaillons sur la recherche et développement d'un emballage multifonction et plus adapté à nos différents produits.</p></li>
<li><p>Enfin, ces fonds serviront au développement d'un nouveau site Web. Cela inclut un nouveau design, une meilleure mise en valeur de nos produits, et la <strong>création d'un e-shop</strong>. Ces démarches vous permettront de commander plus aisément et rapidement vos chocolats personnalisés.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Risques et défis à surmonter</h3>
<p>Chaque nouveau projet est exposé à des risques et à des défis. Nous ne pouvons garantir que tout ira bien. Les produits que nous proposons sont toujours fabriqués à l'aide de prototypes et la <strong>qualité </strong>du résultat <strong>n'est pas ""standardisée""</strong>. Il faut un certain temps pour obtenir un résultat parfait et ce dernier varie en fonction du type de personnalisation demandé. Cela représente le principal défi car, comme dit précédemment, <strong>chaque image possède ce caractère unique </strong>et nous nous démenons afin que vous soyez fiers d'offrir ces cadeaux.</p>
<p>L'intégrité du cadeau lors de la livraison est un autre point crucial. Nos produits sont fragiles et nécessitent une attention particulière, sinon leur intégrité n'est pas garantie. Nous devons encore optimiser le système de livraison et nous ferons de notre mieux pour conserver toute la qualité de vos chocolats! Nous utiliserons pour la campagne le <strong>système de points-relais</strong>, ce qui semble être une bonne alternative puisque consiste en des livraisons groupées et localisées.</p>
<h3>D'autres manières de nous aider</h3>
<p>Si notre projet vous intéresse, mais que vous ne pouvez pas contribuer, ne vous en voulez pas! Nous sommes vraiment déjà reconnaissants que vous aimiez ce que nous faisons.</p>
<p>Néanmoins, il existe de <strong>nombreux moyens </strong>pour nous aider, si vous avez le temps et la volonté de le faire:</p>
<p>- Vous pouvez nous <strong>suivre </strong>sur #<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MiamFactory/?eid=ARD67ucapNLQGhT3ojSHm9zzhQMBByEJixFG1Kr0UVs-4JU8UzFsDoCvQ6itHUkmJ4z8nRiDpBpCt3Ak"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lamiamfactory/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram </a>et <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/18261469"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LinkedIn</a>, simplement en aimant notre page ""La Miam Factory"". Mieux encore, partager notre campagne sur les médias sociaux nous aiderait certainement!</p>
<p>- En outre, nous serions si heureux que vous <strong>partagiez </strong>le message avec vos amis, votre famille et même au travail. Cela nous fera vivre réellement parmi vous tous!</p>
<p>- N'oubliez pas de vérifier les mises à jour de la campagne afin de vous tenir au courant de notre avancement.</p>
<p>- <strong>Vous êtes uniques</strong>, ne doutez jamais de ça! Recherchez toujours des produits et des expériences conçus pour vous et non pour tout le monde.</p>
<p>Encore une fois, <strong>MERCI </strong>pour votre soutien!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What we do with your contributions</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Since 2016, lots of improvements have been done on our technologies. Unfortunately, 5 main problems are to be solved as soon as possible : </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573139443/jib6uxpoxaquagr9kzts.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, any fund will help us to buy material and build machines. Currently, we still use ""functional prototypes"" but nothing is optimized. Without these machines, we can't think of any perspective of development.</li>
<li>Secondly, we need space and room for our activity. Lots of the funds you help us to raise will be used for getting our own place. It includes a production area, a storing area and an office. Basically, that's all we need if we want to bring happiness around us with our products. </li>
<li>Thirdly, the development of a safe transport and delivery system. Indeed, our products are very fragile so traditional companies of transport are not suitable for us.</li>
<li><p>I<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">n addition, the development of a multifunction and more suited packaging is on the menu.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Also, the funds will serve to design our website. For a better use of the platform, as well as the creation of an e-shop which will facilitate and make your orders quicker.</span></p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Every new project is exposed to risks and challenges. It wouldn't be fair to tell you that everything's going alright. </p>
<p>The products we offer are still produced by prototypes and the quality of the design is not ""standardized"".

""Unique, personnalisé, gourmand""
""La Miam Factory"" est une jeune start-up belge fondée en 2016, composée de 7 membres. Nous proposons des produits personnalisables à la demande, grâce à des nouvelles technologies de précision encore inégalées : l'impression 3D ainsi que le marquage au laser. Nous utilisons du chocolat de couverture, d'origine belge, sans utilisation d'un quelconque additif.
Aujourd'hui, nous lançons ce crowdfunding afin que vous nous aidiez dans le développement de notre entreprise. Il a pour objectif  de vous proposer des chocolats conçus par vous et pour vous. Ceux-ci serviront de cadeaux gourmands et uniques pour les fêtes de fin d'année, mais qui peuvent aussi très bien servir pour d'autres événements plus spécifiques, tels que les anniversaires, mariages, et bien d'autres. 
Nous croyons au mélange d'un des meilleurs chocolats, concocté par le chocolatier belge Darcis, associé à la personnalité et l'unicité que vous allez donner à votre chocolat. Voulez-vous y croire avec nous? 

       Marquage au laser                                                Impression  3D                     
Ce que vous recevez
Votre soutien ne sera pas vain! A chacune de vos contributions, vous recevrez évidemment des chocolats de la plus haute qualité, personnalisés par La Miam Factory. Plusieurs produits sont disponibles:
""Tasty Memory"": Un grand chocolat de 14x10cm personnalisé pour vous avec le design que vous désirez. Notre objectif est de vous apporter, comme son nom l'indique, un ""souvenir gourmand"" à partager . C'est pourquoi nous allons développer la photo réelle et l'insérer dans votre emballage avec le chocolat! Juste pour vous, 100 pièces sont offertes au prix Early Birds!

   Exemple de ""Tasty Memory"": Photo en chocolat + vraie photo développée en-dessous
     2. ""Mixed designs"": Vous choisissez un modèle de design que vous préférez et vous pouvez personnaliser le message! Trois modèles sont proposés: Flocon de neige (Snow Flake), Père Noël qui tombe dans une cheminée (Santa Klaus), et la Couronne de Noël (Christmas' wreath). Tous ces produits sont créés à partir de nos deux technologies, l’impression 3D et le marquage au laser. Nous les combinons pour que vous puissiez profiter de deux types de motifs et de deux sortes de chocolat (lait+ noir) dans un seul aliment! Délicieux! 
Exemple du flocon de neige avec un message personnalisé
      3. ""The Big Tree"": Cet élément vous montre la grande possibilité de conception avec la technologie d'impression 3D, toujours complémentée du marquage au laser. De plus, nous vous proposons un autre chocolat, type mignonnette, qui peut être agrémenté du message que vous voulez et de votre signature, ou autre, sur son socle!

Exemple de personnalisation de ""The Big Tree"": message personnalisé  + signature
     4. ""All-in-One"": Ce pack est composé de TOUS les produits, et notamment des 3 types de ""Mixed Designs"" avec un message personnalisé pour chacun des produits! C'est le moyen idéal pour des cadeaux multiples lors de ces fêtes de fin d'année.
En pratique
Après votre commande, c'est là que le jeu commence! Vous recevrez automatiquement un courrier électronique vous expliquant les étapes à suivre afin de nous envoyer votre photo, votre message, etc. à personnaliser. N'oubliez donc pas de consulter votre boîte aux lettres (même vos courriers indésirables) pour vous assurer de recevoir ces informations essentielles!
La livraison aura lieu dans un point-relais qu'il vous sera communiqué entre le 16 et le 22 décembre, juste avant Noël !
Ce que nous ferons de vos contributions
Depuis 2016, de nombreuses améliorations ont été apportées à nos technologies. Aujourd'hui, grâce à votre soutien financier, nous poursuivrons l'amélioration de l'ensemble du processus de production, sur 5 points précis:


Premièrement, ces fonds nous aideront à acheter du matériel supplémentaire et de nouvelles machines. Ainsi, nous pourrons remplacer nos prototypes (déjà fonctionnels) par des machines plus robustes, améliorant par conséquent notre productivité.
Deuxièmement, nous avons besoin d’espace pour nos activités. Une partie conséquente des fonds récoltés par ce crowdfunding sera utilisée pour acquérir de nouveaux locaux. Ils comprendront une zone de production, une zone de stockage et un bureau. De nature minimalistes, c’est tout ce dont nous avons besoin si nous voulons apporter le bonheur autour de nous avec nos produits.

Troisièmement, nous souhaitons mettre au point un système de transport/livraison sûr. Notre objectif est de vous fournir des produits dans un parfait état. En effet, ils sont très fragiles et les sociétés de transport traditionnelles ne nous conviennent pas encore.
De plus, nous travaillons sur la recherche et développement d'un emballage multifonction et plus adapté à nos différents produits.
Enfin, ces fonds serviront au développement d'un nouveau site Web. Cela inclut un nouveau design, une meilleure mise en valeur de nos produits, et la création d'un e-shop. Ces démarches vous permettront de commander plus aisément et rapidement vos chocolats personnalisés.

Risques et défis à surmonter
Chaque nouveau projet est exposé à des risques et à des défis. Nous ne pouvons garantir que tout ira bien. Les produits que nous proposons sont toujours fabriqués à l'aide de prototypes et la qualité du résultat n'est pas ""standardisée"". Il faut un certain temps pour obtenir un résultat parfait et ce dernier varie en fonction du type de personnalisation demandé. Cela représente le principal défi car, comme dit précédemment, chaque image possède ce caractère unique et nous nous démenons afin que vous soyez fiers d'offrir ces cadeaux.
L'intégrité du cadeau lors de la livraison est un autre point crucial. Nos produits sont fragiles et nécessitent une attention particulière, sinon leur intégrité n'est pas garantie. Nous devons encore optimiser le système de livraison et nous ferons de notre mieux pour conserver toute la qualité de vos chocolats! Nous utiliserons pour la campagne le système de points-relais, ce qui semble être une bonne alternative puisque consiste en des livraisons groupées et localisées.
D'autres manières de nous aider
Si notre projet vous intéresse, mais que vous ne pouvez pas contribuer, ne vous en voulez pas! Nous sommes vraiment déjà reconnaissants que vous aimiez ce que nous faisons.
Néanmoins, il existe de nombreux moyens pour nous aider, si vous avez le temps et la volonté de le faire:
- Vous pouvez nous suivre sur #Facebook, Instagram et LinkedIn, simplement en aimant notre page ""La Miam Factory"". Mieux encore, partager notre campagne sur les médias sociaux nous aiderait certainement!
- En outre, nous serions si heureux que vous partagiez le message avec vos amis, votre famille et même au travail. Cela nous fera vivre réellement parmi vous tous!
- N'oubliez pas de vérifier les mises à jour de la campagne afin de vous tenir au courant de notre avancement.
- Vous êtes uniques, ne doutez jamais de ça! Recherchez toujours des produits et des expériences conçus pour vous et non pour tout le monde.
Encore une fois, MERCI pour votre soutien!

""Unique, tasty, natural""
""The Miam Factory"" is a young Belgian start-up founded in 2016, composed of 7 members. We offer customizable products on demand, thanks to new and unmatched precision technologies: 3D printing and laser marking. Chocolate is the food from which we work, without adding or removing any material during our manufacturing processes.
Today, we are launching this crowdfunding with the aim of offering you chocolates designed by you and for you. These will serve as tasty and unique gifts for upcoming Christmas periods, but can serve very well for other more specific events, such as birthday parties, weddings, and many more. Your support will help us enormously in the development of our company.
We believe in mixing one of the best chocolates, produced by the Belgian chocolate maker Darcis, associated with the personality and the uniqueness that you will give to your chocolate. Do you want to believe it with us?

Laser engraving                                                                             3D printing 
 

What You Get
 
By helping us with your contributions, you will obviously receive finest quality chocolates personalized by La Miam Factory.  Several perks are available:
""Tasty Memory"" : One large chocolate of 14x10cm personalized for you with the design you desire. Our goal is to bring you a useful memory. That's why we're going to develop the real design with a photograph and put it in your packaging with the chocolate! Just for you, 100 pieces are offered with Early Birds price! 
​
Sample of ""Tasty Memory"" 
     2. ""Mixed Designs"": You choose the design template you prefer, and you can personalize the message on it! These items use both of our technologies, in 3D printing and engraving. We combine them for you so you can enjoy two types of designs and two types of chocolate, in a single item! Yummy!

Sample of ""Mixed Designs""
     3. ""The Big Tree"": This item shows you the great possibility of design with the 3D printing technology. Plus, we offer you another chocolate that can be customized with every message that you want and your name on the basement!

Sample of customized ""The Big Tree"": message + signature
     4. ""All-in-one"": This last product is composed by ALL the products, and especially the 3 types of ""Mixed Designs"" with a personalized message for each of the products! This is the perfect way for multiple gifts.
After your order, that's where the game begins! You will receive an email which explains you the steps for sending us your picture, message, etc to customize. So don't forget to look at your mailbox (even your spam box) to make sure you receive these essential information!
The delivery will occur between the 16th and the 22th December, just before Christmas Eve.
 
What we do with your contributions
 
Since 2016, lots of improvements have been done on our technologies. Unfortunately, 5 main problems are to be solved as soon as possible : 


Firstly, any fund will help us to buy material and build machines. Currently, we still use ""functional prototypes"" but nothing is optimized. Without these machines, we can't think of any perspective of development.
Secondly, we need space and room for our activity. Lots of the funds you help us to raise will be used for getting our own place. It includes a production area, a storing area and an office. Basically, that's all we need if we want to bring happiness around us with our products. 
Thirdly, the development of a safe transport and delivery system. Indeed, our products are very fragile so traditional companies of transport are not suitable for us.
In addition, the development of a multifunction and more suited packaging is on the menu.
Also, the funds will serve to design our website. For a better use of the platform, as well as the creation of an e-shop which will facilitate and make your orders quicker.


 
Risks & Challenges
 
Every new project is exposed to risks and challenges. It wouldn't be fair to tell you that everything's going alright. 
The products we offer are still produced by prototypes and the quality of the design is not ""standardized"". It takes some time to get the perfect design, and is variable following the customization type. That represents the main challenge because as we told you, every picture has its uniqueness.
The integrity of the gift through delivery is another risk. Most of our products are really fragile and need a special care, otherwise we cannot guarantee their integrity. We still need to work on the delivery system and we will try our best to keep their full quality! We will use for the capaign the relay-points system, which sounds like a good alternative. 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you're interested by our project, but can't contribute, don't blame yourself! We really are already thankful that you like what we do. Nonetheless, lots of ways exist to help us, if you have the time and the will to do it:
- You may follow us on Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn, simply by liking our page ""La Miam Factory"". Even better, sharing our campaign on social medias would definitely help us!
- Also, we would be so happy that you spread the word across your friends, family and even at work. This will make us live truly among all of you!

- You are unique, never doubt about that! Always look for products and experiences that are made for you, and not for everyone.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>First off, I want to start by saying thank you for visiting our page and taking an interest in our campaign. I am extremely excited to start this journey, especially being as how this has been my dream ever since I was a kid. To own my own restaurant has been my dream since I was about ten years old. I remember going to the Greeley Stampede, a local 4th of July rodeo, and thinking how sad it was every time the celebrations were over the carnival, music, and food would all leave and we wouldn’t see it again for another year. So, I wanted to create a restaurant that would offer most if not all these things year-round.</p>
<p>That is why I decided to get more experience in the restaurant industry and got my first job at McDonalds when I was only 16, but my love for the restaurant industry doesn’t start there. I have always been in the restaurants ever since I was a boy. Staying in the back office of Village Inn while my mom was serving. Just the sound of pots and pans banging together, the sizzle of a hot grill and the sound of a busy restaurant sooth me.  This passion for the restaurant industry is what drove me to become a crew trainer after only 3 months at my first job and a manager in training after only a year. I then went on to get my culinary arts certificate and Associates in Business Management. Then I moved into working at various casual dining restaurants, constantly moving my way up everywhere I went.  Even intro a General Management position where I did everything including inventory, scheduling, hiring, firing, truck orders, PR, etc. So, I am very immersed into not only the food end but the business end of the restaurant industry.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Sell</h3>
<p> Average Joes Grill and Chill will sell carnival and state fair type food. Like giant juicy burgers, giant turkey legs, homemade deep fried corn dogs, fresh made lemonade, fried Twinkies, fried Snickers and of course funnel cakes. The funnel cakes will even come in different flavors like strawberry, blueberry, and chocolate. We also will have even seasonal ones like hot chocolate and pumpkin.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> Average Joes is seeking $25,000 to be able to get the funding needed to get a food trailer, the equipment needed inside, and the funds for supplies. $25,000 may seem like a lot but trust me if we work together it will come faster than you know. Every little bit helps and I’ll explain how you can help us not only reach our goal with a contribution as little as $10, but to also receive amazing perks that nobody else will receive.</p>
<p>So, what are these great perks you can receive? Well you can earn many different perks, our easiest one being 2 free funnel cakes of your choice and Facebook recognition for only $10. You can also earn things like free meals, private tours, insight into our menu, see how the food is made, catering at an event of your choosing, t-shirts, and even a menu item named after you! Your contributions truly mean a lot to us and will really help us to reach our goal of getting this trailer up and running.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here’s how your contribution will be put to work to help us get up and running. We will us your contributions to get the trailer needed through companies that have experience in the food truck industry. We will also us these funds to purchase needed equipment like grills, fryers, fridges, freezers, etc. Finally, we will need the food necessary to sell once we are rolling so that is the final piece that this funding will be used for. Soon as the health inspector gives us the green light we will be up and rolling to your closest location!</p>
<p>Now in the unfortunate situation that we are unable to earn 100% of our goal you are probably wondering what happens to your contribution. Well have no fear because Average Joes plans on still being operational. The funds will still be used to purchase needed equipment, and while we would love to receive a brand-new trailer and equipment we are not deterred from getting used equipment and a used trailer to get operational. We are also in the process of speaking with other financial institutions that will see your contributions as interest in the company as a positive. So, know that your much-needed contribution will still be put to use in order to get us up and running.</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

I of all people am aware of the struggles we all go through on a day to day basis, and for that reason I understand that not everyone will be able to contribute on a monetary basis. Thankfully that does not mean that you cannot contribute!

<h3>THE LOWDOWN </h3>
<p>After years of home brewing, hosting excellent beer tastings and hearing about the demand of a Waldorf brewery - we knew opening Patuxent Brewing Company was the right thing to do! We have been working day and night to make this dream come true.  Brewing delicious craft beers, creating a tight business plan, spending time with local agriculturists, raising money, and selling merchandise has helped us get a little closer to our dreams --now we need your help!</p>
<p>We are aiming for a late 2018. This campaign will help us with additional equipment and offsetting some of the costs of the location, while awaiting the opening. </p>
<p>With your help we will have different beers for you to try at the brewery and will also throw an amazing special release event with local, state, federal officials, and most importantly, you! If you have been to one of our tastings you know what you are in for!<br/> </p>
<h3>OUR BEER - OUR GOAL</h3>
<p>We are putting our everything into the brewery and ensuring through stakeholders that we give Waldorf what it needs. Some beers to expect are: The King's Wife IPA, Sweet Potato Bourbon, Orange Ginger, and our standard 301 Pale Ale. </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $25,000.</p>
<p>Please, give what you can, as anything you can do would be super appreciated. Help us reach or goal and even surpass it. The more we raise, the more we can do, the more we can aid our community! It doesn’t get any better than that! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED </h3>
<p>Patuxent Brewing did not expect that the want for a brewery (by the local government), famers, and the community would be such a high demand.  We suspect that our current operations will not stand up to the amount of customers we now expect to receive upon opening. Your support will go to the following items in the brewery.   </p>
<ul><li>Additional Equipment</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>YOUR IMPACT </h3>
<p>Many breweries have considered Waldorf for their brewery location - but did not want to take the time to go through zoning measures, and the stringent inspections we have now covered. However, Waldorf is our home and we want to share all of its wonder and eclecticness with the world of beer lovers. Some of our team have grown up in this area when it was just a forest with a few schools. Now, Waldorf is a booming mecca for young professionals, married couples, and farming communities.  With your giving and help, Charles County will soon have it's FIRST EVER CRAFT BREWERY!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Over the past two years, we have loved serving our doughnuts and coffee to our city. We are looking for help from you, our amazing customers, to take the next step.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are Coy and Sara Trammel the owners of Bristol doughnut Company. We have been married for 14 year and have 4 kids (Emma, Ella, Ruby, and Roscoe).</li>
<li>With your support we will have the ability to fry more doughnuts through out the day, which means fresher doughnuts much faster. </li>
<li>This mean not selling out early and having fresh doughnuts throughout the day.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul><li>There are 3 main pieces of equipment that will allow us to bring you classy and handcrafted doughnuts.<ul>
<li>A Dough Sheeter | This allows us to roll out the dough quickly and evenly.</li>
<li>Proof Box | This allows us to proof the dough in a controlled environment. Producing a more consistent product. </li>
<li>One amazing Glorious Doughnut Fryer! |  The fryer allows us to fry about 40 doughnuts at a time, as opposed to our current fryer which is 6-9 at a time.  </li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
Over the past two years, we have loved serving our doughnuts and coffee to our city. We are looking for help from you, our amazing customers, to take the next step.

We are Coy and Sara Trammel the owners of Bristol doughnut Company. We have been married for 14 year and have 4 kids (Emma, Ella, Ruby, and Roscoe).
With your support we will have the ability to fry more doughnuts through out the day, which means fresher doughnuts much faster. 
This mean not selling out early and having fresh doughnuts throughout the day.

 

What We Need
There are 3 main pieces of equipment that will allow us to bring you classy and handcrafted doughnuts.
A Dough Sheeter | This allows us to roll out the dough quickly and evenly.
Proof Box | This allows us to proof the dough in a controlled environment. Producing a more consistent product. 
One amazing Glorious Doughnut Fryer! |  The fryer allows us to fry about 40 doughnuts at a time, as opposed to our current fryer which is 6-9 at a time.  



 
The Impact

Currently we make all our doughnuts in a shared rented kitchen which has a ton a great equipment, but not all of it is great for the task of making doughnuts.
As we move into our own kitchen we would love to resource our space with the doughnut equipment we need to deliver the best possible product. 
Having this equipment will have a HUGE impact. One that we will feel every day, as we make, proof, and fry the doughnuts. Also, this is an impact you feel because we will freed up to make dough more consistently and in much larger batches so you won't have to come in only to find out we have sold out early. We know this hurts us as much as it hurts you. :)
Moving out of a rented kitchen also allows us to create a cafe space for you. Our new storefront will include a full espresso bar and plenty of seating for you to enjoy coffee and doughnuts with the people you love, creating meaningful moments, in a beautiful space.


 
Risks & Challenges
We know that is owning and operating our own space will come with new challenges and we have a lot to learn, but we have never shied away from a challenge.

Over the past 2 years of business we have made it our goal to get doughnuts out fresh everyday of the week. From the day Sara was in labor and frying doughnuts, to the day Coy was car-jacked coming back to the kitchen, and even when Lindsey was all by herself with no electricity frying doughnuts by the light of her phone. We were open and ready with freshly fried doughnuts. 
With a little hard work, determination, and a bunch of crazy we built this company from nothing and we are just crazy enough to take the next step. 
Your support has been the key to success thus far and we know it's key moving forward.

<p>For us, the most rewarding part of being restaurateurs is being able to share life experiences with our restaurant's guests.  Over the course of a few years and after several family gatherings for holidays or birthday celebrations or children’s christenings, we forge lasting bonds with our guests and get to share in their experiences; essentially adding branches to our own family tree.<br/><br/>When not operating our restaurant, our favorite past time is traveling to different areas and learning about their cultural differences and, of course, having the ability to sample their cuisine. </p>

<p><u><strong>About the Owners</strong></u></p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>Bryan and Brooke Zar are restauranteurs with a combined 44 years of professional experience in the hospitality industry.  Most notable experience (Bryan 5 years, Brooke 3 years) was obtained through Hillstone Restaurant Group, aka Houston’s.  Here is a brief note on Houston’s:</p>
<p> </p>
<h1 align=""center""><i>“Welcome to Houston’s, an American institution since 1977, where our versions of the classics allow the exceptional quality of the ingredients to take center stage. Everything at Houston’s is prepared daily from scratch and each plate is composed with a thoughtful attention to detail. Known for atmospheric spaces influenced over the years by architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Houston’s has a modern feel with a sense of history. Our service strives to be timely and graceful thereby allowing you to focus on the important things: enjoying good company over a fine meal.”   -<a href=""http://www.houstons.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.houstons.com</a></i></h1>
<h1 align=""center""> </h1>
<p>Over the past 41 years, Hillstone Restaurant Group has developed an evolved set of criteria which, when applied correctly, will result in a restaurant’s continued growth and success.  Here are the basic fundamentals:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Provide <strong><i>made from scratch</i></strong> menu items composed of <strong><i>fresh, quality ingredients</i></strong>;</li>
<li>Thoughtfully plate each dish with a precise <strong><i>attention to</i></strong> <strong><i>detail </i></strong>
</li>
<li>Served by a <strong><i>friendly</i></strong> and accommodating staff</li>
<li>In a setting designed to provide maximum comfort with a <strong><i>modern sense of sophistication</i></strong>    </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Bryan and Brooke Zar have applied their experiences with Houston’s into their successful 9+year operation of Restaurant des Familles.  Having purchased Restaurant des Familles in July of 2009 at a time when the restaurant was suffering from decreased sales and near the point of closure, the implementation of these fundamentals produced tremendous sales growth and regained guest loyalties. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Their first six years of ownership provided many obstacles to overcome, most notably Hurricane Isaac (out of business for 10 days) and the BP oil spill.  Despite a few ups and downs, Bryan and Brooke Zar have realized a tremendous transformation between the restaurant they purchased in 2009 and the current restaurant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since July 2009, over $450,000 worth of improvements have been invested in Restaurant des Familles.  Bryan and Brooke Zar have renovated the entire space including the front patio which now includes a paved courtyard with a stone fireplace, the bar, the dining room, the restrooms, and the kitchen and have purchased new equipment throughout. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Their investment has not gone without notice.  The year prior to the purchase produced an annual sales revenue of $550,000.  In 2018, Restaurant des Familles’ annual sales revenue exceeded $1,600,000. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other factors leading to the restaurant’s growth have been improved marketing, improved daily management, more consistent recipe guidelines and a new “made-from-scratch” kitchen philosophy whereas Restaurant des Familles produces all of its own sauces, salad dressings, soups, desserts, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now that Restaurant des Familles has an established nine years of continued sales growth, a well-trained management and employee staff, and a loyal stock of regular guests, the time has come to expand. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>NOLA CAYE is currently an idea and vision shared by Bryan and Brooke Zar.  The concept has a menu with tested recipes and a design palate with tasteful use of modern elements. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>All other factors needed to open NOLA CAYE including, but not limited to, leased location, design / architectural plans, corporate creation, website, permits, etc. are at the ready.  Upon obtaining the necessary capital to buildout out the restaurant space, purchase equipment and purchase beginning inventories, Bryan and Brooke Zar are ready to capitalize on their expertise and make NOLA CAYE an instance success. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The most efficient method to learn about Bryan and Brooke Zar and their desire to succeed is to dine in their restaurant.  The experience received is difficult to summarize in words, but it will be an experience not soon forgotten. </p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p><strong>NOLA CAYE</strong> will be a neighborhood restaurant and bar specializing in Caribbean cuisine.  The menu will feature authentic made-from-scratch recipes with modern presentations.  The restaurant’s décor will reflect a contemporary, modern atmosphere presented in a tasteful, sophisticated manner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>NOLA CAYE</strong> will be a full service, fast-casual concept with the ability to provide its patrons with quality cuisine made with fresh ingredients in a very short amount of time.  This ideal will be one of the most important competitive advantages allowing NOLA CAYE to stand out amongst the numerous eateries in the area. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>NOLA CAYE </strong>will offer its diners authentic, made-from-scratch Caribbean cuisine in a setting designed to provide maximum comfort through thoughtful use of modern design elements such as wood, metal and concrete.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>NOLA CAYE </strong>will source its food ingredients from reputable, local purveyors who shares its passion to deliver the absolute best possible product to NOLA CAYE’s guests.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>NOLA CAYE </strong>will employ genuinely friendly and accommodating individuals who will thrive in the fast-paced environment offered by the restaurant business.  These individuals will be properly trained to provide NOLA CAYE’s diners with efficient, friendly and accommodating service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>NOLA CAYE’s </strong>commitment to outstanding professional service, high-quality food, and an attractive environment with an upscale, high-energy ambiance will distinguish it from other industry competitors. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>NOLA CAYE </strong>will strive to exceed the expectations of its guests throughout every facet of the dining experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>NOLA CAYE’s</strong> success will be measured in employee and guest retention, shareholder profits and continued returns for our investors.</p>

<p>Hello.  My name is Jafar Thorne. I'm a foodie and life-long lover of spice. In 2007, I started making this hot sauce for my annual holiday gifting. It's become such a prized commodity amongst my friends and family over the years that a few of them got together on their own and devised a plan to bring it to market. Basically, one day they informed me I was the founder of a hot sauce company ... and why not? As our Chief Instigating Officer Dave McCary said, ""You've already done the hardest part—making something that people will tell their friends about.""</p>
<p>Thanks to Dave's efforts, and the generosity of our dear friend, Pan Alberts, to date we've tested and refined the recipe with a commercial food-packer, obtained nutritional analysis and approval from the FDA, trademarked our brand, and now stand on the precipice of brewing up our first commercial batch—which brings us to this Indiegogo Campaign ...</p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to raise funds for the production of the first 500 bottles, professionally design the labels, create marketing materials, and bring Third Eye Polish to the world. If successful, we'll raise enough from those 500 bottles to make the next batch, and get this spicy snowball rolling. </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</strong><br/>Our goal of $10,000 will be used for production of the first batch of 500 bottles, professional graphic design of the labels, the design and production of various TEP gift items to be used as perks in the Indiegogo campaign, and shipping for promotional bottles.</p>
<p>For the perks, we have hot sauce for you (and your friends), laser-etched pint glasses, O.G. Sponsor t-shirts, and hoodies. What we really wish is to send a bottle of Polish from our fridge to yours.</p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong><br/>We believe in better living through capsaicin. We want to embolden your Bloody Marys, turn up your tacos, and pizazzify your pizza. While we love the heat, we believe a hot sauce cannot be judged by spice alone and should have a distinct flavor that compliments whatever you add it to. That's why we developed TEP to have a strong garlic-forward flavor profile, balanced by the tartness of lime, the sweetness of tequila, and the robust smokiness of roasted chiles. </p>
<p>The artwork on the bottle is inspired by the work of artist Stephen “The Pizz” Pizzuro, an icon of the low-brow art tradition who took part in an exhibition of blotter art and created the inspiration for the Third Eye Polish mascot. </p>
<p>Lunazul tequila, a 100% blue agave tequila, is used in every bottle, providing a unique balance to the garlic and peppers. We chose Lunazul not only for the flavor, but also for their philanthropic work protecting the native wolves of Mexico. </p>
<p>It is a pleasure to be able to work with artisans who share our love of art, culture, and preservation of the natural world. </p>
<p>Your contribution is what will make the dream a reality—a bottle of Polish for every fridge.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGES</strong><br/>Our biggest challenge will be to get the word out. We're not planning on spending much on advertising at first, instead depending on word of mouth. Once people have tasted Third Eye Polish, they're almost universally hooked, so it's our hope that we'll be able to enlist the help of our friends and fans to share the sauce far and wide. We've already seen this work with our Facebook page and the sauce isn't even available yet!  </p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong><br/>Even if you can't contribute to this campaign, you can let other spiceheads know about us by purchasing a bottle and bringing it to a party, or letting us know about your favorite ways to use Third Eye Polish.</p>

<h2>Who we are &amp; what we believe: </h2>
<p>Dave, Hans and Katie, along with their talented staff of employees and apprentices, work hard to promote local, organic agriculture.  The farm is home to: </p>
<ul>
<li>organic grains like wheat, oats, corn, soybeans, and hay </li>
<li>pastured cows, pigs and chickens </li>
<li>25 acres of organic vegetables, herbs, flowers and fruit  </li>
<li>Restored native habitats, like our prairie and wooded preserves</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe in the potential of local food and small, family farms. <strong>Our hope is that this project will help us to help other farmers and the local food movement as a whole. </strong></p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>We believe one of the answers to growing the local food movement is to help smaller farmers get their product to larger marketplaces. This will create opportunity, awareness, and financial security. We are already making deliveries to Chicago, Springfield, Bloomington and Champaign but our trucks aren't full when we deliver. </p>
<p>But what if we could act as an aggregate for smaller, organic farms? They could drop off their product at our farm, in our new storage facility - large enough to accommodate them, and we could deliver it on their behalf. </p>
<p>And what if we had more space to safely, wash, pack and store our own crops? It would allow us to grow more, employ more, and ultimately feed more.  Imagine being able to find local, organic food 365 days a year. </p>
<p><strong>All we need is some help to fund the building. </strong></p>

<p><u><strong>Here's the breakdown: </strong></u></p>
<p>The total cost of the building. concrete and coolers: $220,000</p>
<p>We received grants for $37,500 and $14,000 in 2018 to partially fund this project.</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise $43,500 from our community through <strong>this</strong> crowdfunding initiative.  (there are approx $5000 in fees/costs associated) </p>
<p>That leaves us with a loan for $119,980. We have saved 20% for the downpayment which leaves financing $95,984.00 through a loan we've been approved for through our local bank. </p>
<p><u><strong>Contribution breakdown: </strong></u></p>

<p>Private grants will make up 24% </p>
<p>Your contributions will make up the remaining: 18% </p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>We are hoping to work with two farms that can participate in this collaboration in 2018 and work with at least 6 farms by 2020.  Our projections, based on previous sales data and sales discussions with a distributor we work with in Chicago, is that those individual farms can expect to see $6000 in produce sales on monthly basis. That's an incredible boost in sales for our region.  </p>
<p>We will also be able to scale up and produce more food and become more efficient and profitable. This means higher wages, safer working conditions, employees that want to stick around and continue to contribute to our movement. </p>

<h2><i>Summary</i></h2>
<p>Jamboree Jams is a small batch jam and marmalade company based in New Orleans. All of our fruit is sourced locally from farmers in Louisiana and Mississippi and we use copper pots, the least amount of sugar we can get by with, and no commercial pectin to create fruit-focused jars of jam.</p>
<p>We've been working out of a commissary kitchen for the past 5 years but have been struggling to keep up with wholesale and retail orders for some time as we outgrow the space.</p>
<p>After a year and a half of searching, we've finally found the perfect production kitchen, jam studio, and retail space in the Marigny to call our own! </p>
<p>This is a very exciting moment of growth and we are so happy to share it with y'all as we Crowdfund this jam dream into a reality!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><i>Who We Are</i></h2>
<p>Jamboree is comprised of Sara Levasseur, who began the business in 2016 after a lifelong interest in jam and preserving learned in her grandmother's raspberry garden; jam-maker from day 1 Nadia Ogbor, skilled jam master and chef; and Sara's partner Carl Hugmeyer, handyman and longtime sole prep-worker.  As we expand our production, we also look forward to expanding our team.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2><i>We Need Your Help!</i></h2>
<p>We are very lucky to have found a space that has already been built out as a restaurant by its previous tenants and beloved neighborhood butcher, Shank Charcuterie. As a result, we have been able to set our opening budget at a much more manageable level than most. </p>
<p>We're asking for contributions from our friends, families, and community to raise $15,000 in order to make our initial equipment purchases and build out the retail shop space without going into considerable debt. We will be purchasing a new gas range, a jar filler, a full-size fridge, freezer, and an oven. </p>
<p>Our goal has been carefully considered to account for these costly pieces of equipment as well as the paint, tile, and wood required to polish the shop off. Our goal also includes the costs involved in producing the perks, the fees taken by Indiegogo, and estimated taxes . Any shipping required will be invoiced separately. </p>
<p>We've come up with a few exclusive offers as perks to help raise funds and have also been lucky to receive donations from local artists and creatives to help us raise funds. You're also able to contribute any amount unrelated to the perks on offer. All contributions are extremely appreciated and all contributors will receive a personal thank you.</p>

</div><div>
<h2><i>The Impact</i></h2>
<p>With your help, we'll be able to take on a lot <strong>more fruit</strong>, which means a lot <strong>more jam and marmalade</strong> both in New Orleans and beyond. We're hoping to have at least one stockist in each major city <strong>across the Southern States</strong> by the end of 2021 and in <strong>all major cities across the US </strong>by the end of 2022. We'll also be able to expand to offer <strong>shipping to Canada</strong>! And to stock in stores in <strong>Toronto, Montreal,</strong> and <strong>Vancouver/Victoria.</strong></p>
<p>We'll be able to explore <strong>new flavors</strong>, work with fruit we've never had the capacity to in the past, and pursue <strong>additional methods of preservation</strong>. We're most excited to begin offering Tomato Jam, Muscadine Jelly, and Gherkins.</p>
<p>We'll be able to bring back <strong>jelly donuts</strong> and <strong>soft serve </strong>and<strong> have regular shop hours.</strong></p>
<p>We'll be able to <strong>work with more local farmers and small business owners.</strong></p>
<p>For reference, ALL of our fruit for our jam and marmalade is sourced locally. If we meet our Crowdfunding Goal, we will be able to <strong>up our jam production 300%</strong> in the first year alone! That means <strong>3x the fruit orders from us for farmers across Louisiana</strong> (citrus, figs, strawberries, blackberries, mayhaws) <strong>and in Mississippi</strong> (blueberries, pears, peaches, plums). That amounts to upwards of <strong>$10,000 re-invested back into our farming community</strong> <strong>each year </strong>in fruit purchases alone!</p>

<p>Mabuhay! We are  a husband and wife team who originally are from the Philippines. I was born and raised in Pangasinan and now married to Denver, a Batangueno.  Fortunately, we both share the same passion for food and we would like more people to join us in gastronomical adventure of Filipino dishes!</p>
<p>My relationship with food and love of doing work in the kitchen started as early as when I was 6 years old. My <i>""lolo</i>"" (grandpa) and <i>""lola""</i> (grandma) took me under their wings and as a form of gratitude I would cook rice for dinner so when they come home, it would be ready for them. Needless to say, I was the epitome of an ideal ""apo"" or grand child. They were both very hardworking and I figured it is the least I can do to help. From them, I have learned the basics in as I would observe their ways in the kitchen and was most of the time an active participant specially when she taught me how to cook ""<i>diningding,</i>"" a staple in any Ilocano household.</p>
<p>In 2003, we relocated to Chicago and transferred to Arizona in 2014. Missing all the food places there, we began exploring what Arizona has to offer. Back then, there were only a few choices in the area so we started just cooking for our own, specially the Filipino dishes.</p>
<p>Our humble beginnings in the business started way back in 2014 when I took a chance to post on Facebook to sell two of the most famous Filipino dishes,<i> lumpia</i> and <i>pancit</i>. The response was overwhelming and from then on, we never stopped serving one Filipino favorite dish to another.  As years go by, we have accommodated the request of our loyal customers who want a variety of other Filipino food like <i>adobo, caldereta, sinigang, pinakbet, sisig, dinuguan. </i>Early this year, we ventured in to grilled platters (both meat and seafood), and assorted dessert platers (<i>puto, kutsinta, cassava, sapin-sapin, pichi-pichi, bibingka and maja blanca</i>). Along with these, by popular demand, we also do baked breads (Spanish bread and <i>pan de sal</i>) and cakes.</p>
<p><strong>""PINAS-sarap na Babalik-balikan"" </strong>simply means showcasing Filipino dishes that are worth coming back to over and over again. <i>""PINAS""</i> is short for Pilipinas and <i>""Sarap"" </i>means delicious. Embedded in our Filipino culture is our love for food. Surprisingly, our customers come from different cultures and that is one of the best things that this venture has given us much satisfaction about. Being able to let others taste, experience and celebrate life with good food for all occasions or even if there is none and you just simply want good food, <strong>Tambayan at Joann's</strong> is the place to have in mind.</p>
<p>With this, we  would like to invite you to join us in building <strong>Tambayan at Joann's</strong>. ""T<i>ambayan"" </i> is a Filipino term for a place to hang out or chill, We envision <strong>Tambayan at Joann's</strong> as your go to place if you  are craving for all time favorite Filipino food. </p>
<p>Your participation in our <strong>Rewards Crowdfunding Campaign</strong> to assist us with our start- up fund is a necessary step towards the realization of our dream. Raised funds will mostly go to buying the equipment and capital we need to initially start and run for a few months. For Arizonians, our restaurant will serve our West Valley friends. Rest assured that we will deliver our best to cater all of you. We are ready to serve our great food. We work hard everyday perfecting our menu and recipes for  you.</p>
<p>Moreover, a portion of our earnings will be earmarked for foundations we support such as <i><strong>Abaka Foundation</strong></i>, a non profit organization which aims to spread interest, understanding and appreciation of the Filipino language, culture, music specially for Filipino-American kids based in Arizona. It is an organization close to my heart as I also want my children to know their roots. Aside from this, I will be supporting another organization geared towards giving scholarship to deserving students. Not only are you helping us realize our dreams but you will be a part of giving back to our community. This means so much to us and we appreciate and thank you in advance for all your help. </p>
<p><strong>Our target is to raise $120,000 which will cover equipment  &amp; help us with start up expenses.  By contributing to Tambayan at Joann's, for every dollar you contribute, we will give you back your original amount plus 50% in the form  of a gift card that you can use to purchase our food when we open. For example, a $100 donation is equivalent to $150 gift card. </strong>Moreover, this is a flexible campaign funding which means even after the allotted time to donate has expired, you can still do so in support of Tambayan at Joann's. For those who are not able to donate, spreading the word about Tambayan at Joann's by word of mouth or social media will be most welcome.

<p><strong>WHY TREENUT CHEESE?</strong></p>
<p>Approximately 65 percent of the human population has a reduced ability to digest lactose after infancy. Besides humans (and companion animals who are fed by humans), no species drinks milk beyond infancy or drinks the milk of another species. Cow’s milk is suited to the nutritional needs of calves, who have four stomachs, gain hundreds of pounds in a matter of months, and sometimes weigh more than 1,000 pounds before they are 2 years old.</p>
<p>Moreover, cow’s milk is a cruel and unhealthy product: cows are treated as milk-producing machines and are genetically manipulated, pumped full of antibiotics and hormones, artificially inseminated shortly after their first birthdays and again and again, so they can give milk throughout their life.</p>
<p>While cows suffer on factory farms, humans who drink their milk increase their chances of developing heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and many other ailments. Making matters worse, large dairy farms have an enormously detrimental effect on the environment. The dairy industry is the primary source of smog-forming pollutants, and a single cow emits more of these harmful gasses than a car does.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488452662/fayeby1rheqscizxnhpq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>WHAT CAN WE DO?  </strong></p>
<p>We are passionate about delicious gourmet food that provides a wholesome, cruelty-free, eco-sustainable alternative for those who wish to live a conscious, intentional life.</p>
<p><i><strong>“Let food be thy medicine, and medicine be thy food.” – Hippocrates</strong></i></p>
<p>Imagine a tasty gourmet cheese plate full of probiotics. Cheese that gives you great taste that tickles your palate, but provides your body with a variety of friendly bacteria essential for your health. A food full of aliveness that becomes even better with time, making you feel more vital and beautiful.</p>
<p>Cheese whose production brings no harm to nature as it is 100% raw, relying solely on the fermentation process and its qualities.</p>
<p>Rich in vitamin B, enzymes, proteins, and fibers, the nut cheese that we will produce at <strong>Cheese the Queen</strong> is conducive to strengthening your microbiome and helping to boost your energy, beauty, and vitality. Our cheese is intended for food lovers and health enthusiasts alike. A tasty, fair-trade, and eco-sustainable relative to dairy products, our nut cheese combines the power of modern technology with all the wisdom of the Bulgarian fermentation tradition.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488452744/eihk2fvemluiwn0jnbtq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>A CAUSE FOR CONSCIOUS FOOD PRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>Mass production has caused a lot of damage, leading us every day further towards an eco-catastrophe. By losing our contact with nature and our bodies, we forget our real needs and encounter different illnesses. There are virtually no nutrients in animal-based foods that are not better provided by plants.</p>
<p>For years we have lived with calcium in dairy products, but modern medical studies indicate that milk may actually increase women’s risk of getting osteoporosis instead providing a necessary source of calcium. Humans can get all the calcium and protein they need from nuts, seeds, yeast, grains, beans, and other legumes. It’s difficult not to get enough calories from protein when you eat a healthy diet.</p>
<p>The product you are supporting is compassionate to animals and beneficial for humans. But our process is also ethical and eco-sustainable, and our production is harmless to nature.</p>
<p>By supporting <strong>Cheese The Queen</strong>, you are supporting a healthier life, wholesome food, a conscious approach to a cleaner environment and local artisanal production.</p>
<p>We believe that all living beings deserve nutritional food and nature to support their well-being.</p>
<p><br/><u><strong>FACTS:</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Our production is eco-sustainable in comparison to dairy products. We don’t use animals for ethical, environmental and health reasons. Except the lactose and casein intolerance, cows are the biggest producers of methane.</li>
<li>The products we use are fair-trade. We believe that food should be made with love, but in an ethical and respectful way.</li>
<li>70-80% of our health depends on our microbiome. Good health requires prebiotics and probiotics, which are in fermented &amp; cultured foods in which Bulgaria has a rich tradition. We have something important we can give to the world – with your help.</li>
<li>We keep it fun! Our production is delicious, pairs perfectly with wine and goes over amazingly well at parties! It’s simply awesome!</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488452771/hdkqalt1u1howwtemuya.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>WHY IN BULGARIA?</strong></p>
<p>Bulgaria is a land where fermented foods reign supreme. This tradition dates all the way back to the 5th century, when the Thracians were already using recipes that had been passed down through the centuries. In 1905, a Bulgarian doctor discovered Lactobacillus bulgaricus, which became the world’s first recognized probiotic; it ushered in a new era of delicious, medicinal food. Because as much as 80% of our health relies on our microbiome, probiotics found in fermented foods are a key component of a healthy lifestyle. With <strong>Cheese the Queen</strong>, we aim to establish a small factory for artisanal, plant-based cheese produced in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>We are creating a bridge between traditional techniques and modern life. We believe that a plant-based approach can help save the planet in a delicious &amp; healthy way. Our product combines the ancient techniques used by our ancestors with a modern approach to give the world an amazing food we all need. Our cheeses come from fair-trade cashews and almond milk. We culture them with acidophilus, which converts them into a great probiotic food for you. Some cheeses age for weeks to develop deeper, tangy flavors, while others are fresh and light soft spreads.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488452797/kkfmlj8mvtfyuukd6j93.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>HOW IT</strong><strong> WILL</strong><strong> REACH YOU?     </strong></p>
<p>Bulgaria is a small country, but we have the knowledge and traditions to create a beneficial and delightful product.</p>
<p>The strategic position of our country will help us to export to all of Europe to begin with, and meanwhile take steps to research how to spread the news around the world – and go bigger.</p>
<p>We believe that people deserve good food for more energy and the health they need to fully enjoy life. In the world’s minds, there has been a longstanding clash between the gourmet experience and raw and vegan cuisine. Lovers of traditional foods date back centuries, like cheeses, but many refuse to believe that satisfactory taste can be achieved by using a healthier, plant-based approach. We believe in the opposite. We have tested our cheeses on our families, friends, focus groups, people we have never met before, vegans and omnivores. It has been rated as a delicacy, a great wine companion and table-wanted. We’re not only focused on its health benefits, but paying precise attention to its taste qualities.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT DO WE NEED YOUR HELP FOR?</strong></p>
<p>We are turning to you to help us raise start-up capital of $12 000 that will cover the costs of getting Cheese the Queen off the ground. With your help, we will rent a place where we can establish a small factory. We will buy the equipment we need to start producing and launch a marketing campaign to expand awareness of conscious food production. We appreciate any and all contributions that will support our mission to create gourmet tree-nut cheeses for people who want to live a more conscious, healthy &amp; delightful lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>OUR BUDGET:</strong></p>
<p>All our tree nut cheeses are made by hand and contain all the love that food needs to be alive and delicious.<br/>To create our start-up production volume, we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>to rent and renovate our boutique “factory” so it covers all the regulatory requirements and we can go through all the procedures regarding legalization - $2 500</li>
<li>microbiologic analysis of the products - $ 600</li>
<li>2 dehydrators - $ 1 000</li>
<li>1 professional blender system - $ 1 700</li>
<li>2 fridges - $ 1 300</li>
<li>professional working tables, shelves and utensils - $ 1 300</li>

The product you are supporting is compassionate to animals and beneficial for humans. But our process is also ethical and eco-sustainable, and our production is harmless to nature.
By supporting Cheese The Queen, you are supporting a healthier life, wholesome food, a conscious approach to a cleaner environment and local artisanal production.
We believe that all living beings deserve nutritional food and nature to support their well-being.
FACTS:

Our production is eco-sustainable in comparison to dairy products. We don’t use animals for ethical, environmental and health reasons. Except the lactose and casein intolerance, cows are the biggest producers of methane.
The products we use are fair-trade. We believe that food should be made with love, but in an ethical and respectful way.
70-80% of our health depends on our microbiome. Good health requires prebiotics and probiotics, which are in fermented & cultured foods in which Bulgaria has a rich tradition. We have something important we can give to the world – with your help.
We keep it fun! Our production is delicious, pairs perfectly with wine and goes over amazingly well at parties! It’s simply awesome!


WHY IN BULGARIA?
Bulgaria is a land where fermented foods reign supreme. This tradition dates all the way back to the 5th century, when the Thracians were already using recipes that had been passed down through the centuries. In 1905, a Bulgarian doctor discovered Lactobacillus bulgaricus, which became the world’s first recognized probiotic; it ushered in a new era of delicious, medicinal food. Because as much as 80% of our health relies on our microbiome, probiotics found in fermented foods are a key component of a healthy lifestyle. With Cheese the Queen, we aim to establish a small factory for artisanal, plant-based cheese produced in Bulgaria.
We are creating a bridge between traditional techniques and modern life. We believe that a plant-based approach can help save the planet in a delicious & healthy way. Our product combines the ancient techniques used by our ancestors with a modern approach to give the world an amazing food we all need. Our cheeses come from fair-trade cashews and almond milk. We culture them with acidophilus, which converts them into a great probiotic food for you. Some cheeses age for weeks to develop deeper, tangy flavors, while others are fresh and light soft spreads.

HOW IT WILL REACH YOU?     
Bulgaria is a small country, but we have the knowledge and traditions to create a beneficial and delightful product.
The strategic position of our country will help us to export to all of Europe to begin with, and meanwhile take steps to research how to spread the news around the world – and go bigger.
We believe that people deserve good food for more energy and the health they need to fully enjoy life. In the world’s minds, there has been a longstanding clash between the gourmet experience and raw and vegan cuisine. Lovers of traditional foods date back centuries, like cheeses, but many refuse to believe that satisfactory taste can be achieved by using a healthier, plant-based approach. We believe in the opposite. We have tested our cheeses on our families, friends, focus groups, people we have never met before, vegans and omnivores. It has been rated as a delicacy, a great wine companion and table-wanted. We’re not only focused on its health benefits, but paying precise attention to its taste qualities.

WHAT DO WE NEED YOUR HELP FOR?
We are turning to you to help us raise start-up capital of $12 000 that will cover the costs of getting Cheese the Queen off the ground. With your help, we will rent a place where we can establish a small factory. We will buy the equipment we need to start producing and launch a marketing campaign to expand awareness of conscious food production. We appreciate any and all contributions that will support our mission to create gourmet tree-nut cheeses for people who want to live a more conscious, healthy & delightful lifestyle.
OUR BUDGET:
All our tree nut cheeses are made by hand and contain all the love that food needs to be alive and delicious.To create our start-up production volume, we need:

to rent and renovate our boutique “factory” so it covers all the regulatory requirements and we can go through all the procedures regarding legalization - $2 500
microbiologic analysis of the products - $ 600
2 dehydrators - $ 1 000
1 professional blender system - $ 1 700
2 fridges - $ 1 300
professional working tables, shelves and utensils - $ 1 300
packaging (eco-sustainable) - $ 900
fair-trade nuts and herbs - $ 1 300
outreach campaign and materials to raise the awareness of the benefits of tree-nut cheese and sustainable dairy-free food production - $ 1 400


OUR BRAND STORY:We believe good food is like a good fairy tale. It has a long story before it reaches your belly, where it reaches its happy end. Good food is the Queen, and the Queen loves healthy delights! With your help, Cheese the Queen will live happily ever after. We will all be one small step closer to a more sustainable and healthy gourmet culture –thanks to the delicious food we have in store for you!

<h2>Why Drink Wingman?</h2>
<p>Like many people all across the world, I, Ryan Schaub CEO, have always had a lack of confidence and struggled with a great deal of social and personal situations.

Wingman is here to change that. Using our immense passion of supplements, we have created the first life enhancement drink that will improve confidence, raise serotonin levels, decrease anxiety, and increase focus and energy, for an elite combination that will unlock your full potential. </p>

<h3><strong>What is M.A.G.O Cafe?</strong></h3>
<p>M.A.G.O Cafe stands for Maids. Anime. Gaming. Otaku.</p>
<p>Previously known as Otaku Cafe; M.A.G.O Cafe is UK based travelling/popup maid cosplay cafe. We provide delicious authentic Japanese drinks and treats (Cakes included) provided by our friendly themed maids. The atmosphere is warm, friendly and fun plus all of our customers are treated with the care and undivided attention they all deserve. You can play games, take photos and partake in fun competitions with our maids. It is an experience like no other and we welcome everyone of all ages to join us!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>Background</strong> </h3>
<p>After travelling to Japan a few times (Since 2011), a friend and I experienced the maid cafe franchise in many different ways, this ranged from quirky to weird. We had so much fun and enjoyed the interaction with every cafe we visited, so it only seemed right to want to share those experiences. Because of these experiences it was felt that the UK deserved to feel how we felt when being surrounded in this atmosphere. From that moment on the Cafe was created so that I could bring the same experiences to those that cannot travel to Japan themselves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After running a couple of pop-ups in 2016, it was felt that there were mistakes made in terms of location and even timing. Since then I had re-worked and re-configured ways to bring an even bigger and better experience for a much wider demographic. This includes building a new website, re-branding and re-designing our look and name. Joining forces with an Otaku Cafe supporter, we went through planning, better research and came up with a way to get more people involved in the franchise. Because of this M.A.G.O Cafe was created.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Our Goals, Risks and Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>The contributions received will allow us to complete the final step to launching M.A.G.O. Cafe in May 2017. This will allow us to partake in May's MCM Expo 2017. If successful, we are hoping to bring our Cafe to different locations within London and eventually more of the UK. We have already started the company, hired our maids, purchased the uniforms and accessories, finalised our menu and now need to acquire new merchandise, obtain new stock and prizes for our old and new customers. In addition, the more money we raise gives us a better chance of us taking part other conventions and pop-up spaces across the country!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our backers will receive wonderful rewards during the MCM event or one of our pop-ups; these rewards range from free cakes/drinks to paid entrance to May's MCM Comicon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What are our risks?</p>
<ul>
<li>Our campaign is unsuccessful, meaning that we can only run for one event</li>
<li>We are unable to provide the more exciting experiences to our customers due to low funding</li>
<li>Our strategic approach to obtain customers becomes less effective</li>
</ul>
<p>What are our challenges?</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase our existing fan base</li>
<li>Obtain a wider demographic</li>
<li>Becoming successful against competitive cafes</li>
</ul>
<p>We are more than prepared to face any and all challenges and risks that come our way as we believe in our Cafe's success :) Even if we are unable to meet our target here, we will still launch in May 2017 and do our best to bring an everlasting experience to our customers.</p>

<h3><strong>A LITTLE BACKGROUND </strong></h3>
<p>Paradox Farm began it’s journey in 2008 when Hunter and I bought a few goats and a llama.<br/>Why? Well a few reasons; We became interested in producing our own food for health and food security reasons. The local food movement was hitting the area and… yes.. we had too much wine one night and decided to buy livestock.</p>
<p>Both of us.. OK more me.. have the tendency to plow ahead into something and lift my head up later. Well, it was head down until we found ourselves eating dinner at Ashten’s in Southern Pines one evening in 2011 with our signature Cheese Louise! on the menu. Since 2011 the farm has grown every year, adding more milking does, equipment and new goat milk products.</p>
<p>In 2014 the unexpected and heartbreaking loss of Hunter put me in a quandary of how to proceed. Knowing that Hunter always had my back I put my head down again, and with the help of wonderful old friends and the addition of amazing new friends, pushed forward...again.</p>
<p>In 2016 we were able to return to producing our raw milk aged goat cheese collection called Southern Comforts with great success!  Now we need more space to keep up with the demand.</p>
<h3><strong>THE CHEESE CAVE</strong></h3>
<p>I bought a barn.. with no buyers remorse. Seriously. It is an old tobacco barn from a local estate sale. You know you are a farmer when you can send friends a photo and say..""hey can you help me with this? I want to take it back to the farm for a cheese cave""  And they say ""Sure!"" Board by board it came down and board by board it went up even better than before. </p>
<p>Now I need help finishing the inside to USDA specifications.</p>
<p>Insulated walls and ceiling, and a sealed floor are required along with washable surfaces and electricity. Temperature in a cheese cave needs a constant 55-60 degrees and 85-90% humidity. We have about $4,500 into the project to date.  It will take us another $7,500 to finish the inside and have the cave ready for cheese. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Community</h3>
<p>Paradox Farm is the only dairy farm in our area. We love our community; opening the farm for tours, tastings and events regularly to bring our efforts at healthy eating and food security to our neighbors. In order to be sustainable as a business we know we need to continually grow by producing cheese that we can offer year round. Aged cheese expands our selling season. Goats may produce milk for only 9-10 months a year but they eat for 12 months! And so do I.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are in our 6th year selling cheese. Our projections have all the indications of success. But honestly.. we need this year to make it work.  I am very excited about this project and have already seen expanded interest in our aged cheeses. </p>

<p><strong>Who we are…</strong></p>
<p>Falls Church Distillers is first, and foremost, a family business. I grew up in the Northeast in a small town with a large Italian immigrant population, including my own family, whose customs not only include great food and art, but also the making of wine and liquors. </p>
<p>With degrees from Penn State and the University of San Francisco and after a tour in the Air Force where I was educated in computer communications skills, I applied my experiences and skills to a 35 year successful career first as an engineer and then in sales and management. I raised my sons to value hard work, community, and of course, good spirits! I’m proud that my son A1C Christian Paluzzi continues our family tradition of military service and my other son Lorenzo shares my passion for distilling, focusing his education on chemistry.</p>
<p>In this Falls Church venture we combine my management experience with Lorenzo’s chemistry knowledge to produce locally distilled spirits. We chose Falls Church because of its fierce sense of community and support of local businesses. We have called Virginia home for 25 years and six years ago, we discovered Falls Church and found a community with similar values to the community I grew up in.</p>
<p>When we decided to open a distillery, we found Falls Church to be the most supportive city &amp; community. While discussing our options with other local governments we ran into a myriad of bureaucracy and red tape that made it seem impossible, but a friend suggested I speak with the City of Falls Church. Within hours the city had set up a meeting and given tentative approval, working hard to make my dream a reality. I knew I had found the right place, a community of open minded people willing to embrace new ventures.</p>
<p>We have grown tremendously over the past year with this community’s support!</p>
<p><strong>What we’re asking...</strong></p>
<p>With our successes comes new challenges. When we began, we opened our distillery and a single ABC store. Now we have transformed the distillery into a full bar and restaurant and sell our spirits in numerous stores across the state of Virginia.</p>
<p>While our restaurant business is going strong, we need your help to grow our VA ABC Store  and multi-State presence.</p>
<p>We have recently signed contracts with the ABC in West Virginia and a distributor in Illinois and are in discussion with Pennsylvania and California, among others. The demand for Falls Church Distillers spirits is high and growing! In order to more easily satisfy that demand, we could use help from our friends, family and community.</p>
<p>The approximate cost for fulfilling demand is $20,000 for each state we enter. Providing our spirits to these markets takes a much larger inventory than we have the capability to secure on our own. Your support will allow us to significantly increase our production (to working in the distillery nearly every day!), purchase the bottles, corks and labels needed just to have the liquor available, and cover the extensive costs of shipping so much inventory across the nation. We’ll also need to fund our brand ambassadors and tasting events to secure these markets.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of contributing...</strong></p>
<p>We are counting once again on the generosity of the Falls Church community and asking you to join our family here at the distillery. As a member of our family we want to show you our appreciation!</p>
<p>We’ll be creating a page on our website to thank ALL of our donors publicly, no matter the size of the gift!</p>
<p>Each $50+ donor will receive their choice of a Falls Church Distillers hat or t-shirt.</p>
<p>Donate $100 and receive a private tour and tasting for two with our distillers themselves! Ask them all the questions you’ve ever had about distilling and the spirits they create.</p>
<p>For those donors that contribute $250 or more, we’ll be hosting a private celebratory event just for you.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to learn to make our specialty cocktails and a range of the classics at home, donate $500 or more to join our chemist and bartenders for a fun mixology workshop.</p>
<p>For a $1,000 contribution we’ll send you a gift basket with one bottle of each of our four flagship spirits that began this venture — Bourbon, Whiskey, Vodka, and Gin</p>
<p>Contribute $2,500 and get your own distillery takeover! You and 25 of your closest friends can enjoy the entire distillery to yourselves for an evening with heavy appetizers provided and a discounted cash bar (Restricted to Monday - Thursday evenings from 7 pm - 10 pm).</p>
<p>If you give $5,000 or more we will forever commemorate your contribution with an engraved plaque predominately displayed in our Distillery Spirits Plant.</p>
<p>And for those donors who give $10,000 or more, you’ll receive your very own barrel of Church Bourbon at cask strength (typically 121-124 proof!). The bourbon will be bottled in your own personalized bottle with your name right on the label and you can keep the barrel to display at your home, or wherever you’d like.</p>
<p><strong>How else you can help…</strong></p>
<p>If you aren’t able to contribute financially to our efforts, we can still use your help! Help us get the word out about our project. Please share this campaign with your friends and family or anyone you know who may be able to contribute.</p>
<p>You can also just stop by the distillery for dinner or drinks and bring friends. If you have a favorite Virginia or West Virginia ABC store that doesn’t currently carry our spirits, place an order and they’ll be added to our list of ever expanding carriers.</p>
<p>All support helps us take the Falls Church Distillers name across this great nation!</p>

<h3>A Little About Us ... </h3>
<p>Annie Lepillez - CEO|Head Crêpetier</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494294300/rppcvnjp9jxfr10gfkps.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Born and raised in Valence, France, Annie's roots emanate that of a true French woman; passionate not only about food, but also about the structure of her recipes and the science that goes into creating them.  </p>
<p>Where did her inspiration come from you ask? While waiting for her original career plan of becoming an Air Traffic Controller to take flight [no pun intended], Annie decided to join the United States Air Force Reserves to continue relishing in her love of the skies while inducing acts of humanitarianism. However, after a few years of service she soon realized that flying wasn't her only passion. After spending nearly five months deployed in the Middle East, she started reminiscing  about her childhood in France, and how her parents always cooked homemade crêpes every Sunday evening for her family. Her profound passion for food then embellished so much she wanted to find a way to share it in a larger capacity.  ​</p>
<p>Upon returning home to the states Annie began to set her newfound passion  into motion. After many entrepreneurial workshops and countless hours business planning, the venture toward opening Colorado Crêpe Company would officially come to pass. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Leah Shockley - CMO | Sous Chef ​</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494294410/niptakoenwb0umgcrlgt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With over eight years of experience in the food and hospitality industry coupled with four years in marketing/PR, Leah is a diverse entrepreneur and one who is suited to thrive in the foodie world of gourmet food trucks. She has a strong passion not only for great food, but the nutrients that wholesome eats provide at the core.  </p>
<p>After her 2009 diagnoses of Multiple Sclerosis and three year battle attempting to find the right modern day therapies to combat the disease, her passion for healthy living grew exponentially. After many years of research she learned there was no greater medicine than the food we ingest to nourish our bodies. From that moment on she knew she wanted to develop a company that held her same values and saw them through in a big way.​</p>
<p>After meeting Annie, she quickly realized their passions complimented each other and knew they were on the verge of something exceptional. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>While we've managed to spread the love and our crêpes through catered events, we've barely scratched the surface of our community. We really want the opportunity to share on an expansive level. </p>
<p>Soon we will be featured inside of a new culinary concept called ""Food Truck Alley"", a cute house on a decent plot of land in the heart of Old Colorado City. Here, food trucks located in the Springs can come and park for designated amounts of time during any given day while customers filter in and out. It is an inviting lot with streaming lights, music, and various food truck options to choose from. Because we don't own a food truck at this time, we are being featured on the inside of this space at the ""crêpe bar"" we built. This has been monumental for us and allows the public to experience our foodie culture as well as the wholesomeness we can bring to the table. Though this is an amazing opportunity, we are striving for more mobile capabilities in an effort to spread the Colorado Crêpe Company culture further than just our front door. </p>
<p>One of our main business pillars is market sharing. We'd like to eliminate the harsh competitive structure that has been America’s capitalistic society and bring business back to its grassroots. We want to partner with as many community based businesses as possible, as well as gain insights from our customers for new ideas and crêpe recipes. We <i>firmly</i> believe this business belongs to the community as much as it belongs to us.</p>
<p>With the assistance from our donors and patrons we will be able to embellish upon our community driven mission, integrating our love and passion of healthful food inside an unparalleled mobile crêperie. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've done some serious research as to what type of truck we'd like to develop, the size, structure, components, equipment, and aesthetics. Here is the transparent list we came up with:</p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>A truck </li></ul>
<p><i>We've found a fully renovated truck for about $48,000 and a skeleton of a truck for about $12,000 that will require a complete overhaul. We believe the later option will be more expensive and more work overall, but it provides us the opportunity to customize it and make it functional and fun for ourselves and our customers. </i></p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>Aesthetics</li></ul>
<p><i>Once we have the truck, we need to make it pretty and appealing. This includes engraving our logo on the old barn wood backdrop, lining the rest of the exterior in sheet metal, and creating a fun plexi-glass window so you can see us in action when we are building your made-to-order crêpe.</i></p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>Industrial propane crêpe griddles</li></ul>
<p><i>While we currently have two commercial griddles, they aren't the proper grade or structure we need for continued service and demand on a food truck. </i></p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>Food storage bins/half size industrial refrigerator/mop sink</li></ul>
<p><i>A no brainer here ... </i></p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>Generator and propane tanks </li></ul>
<p><i>In order to go mobile and stay mobile we need electricity and gas to function.</i></p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>Startup capital for food inventory</li></ul>
<p><i>This will be rather costly due to our strict  local, organic, and authentic food sourcing. We are estimating about $2,000 initial inventory cost. This includes seasonings, spices, beverage syrups, coffee, creamers, and all our staples such as flour, milk, eggs, meat, veggies, etc.</i> </p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>Cooking supplies and service utensils </li></ul>
<p><i>Can't cook without spatulas, pots, and pans! And you'll need something to eat with, right?</i> </p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>Website development cost and maintenance </li></ul>
<p><i>A business can't exist without a website these days. And building one costs a couple thousand at least, let alone the cost to maintain it! </i></p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>A modest marketing budget</li></ul>
<p><i>We aren't talking billboards here. More like enough funding to run mini campaigns on social media, like Facebook and Instagram - $500 would be ideal to get us through the end of the year.</i></p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>Permits and licenses </li></ul>
<p><i>It cost us about $1,500 just to get a catering license, which was minimal. Opening a mobile kitchen is a totally different ball game. PLUS, we will have to maintain both licenses in order to continue doing private caterings and servicing the public on our truck.</i></p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>Added equipment expenses needed in order to continue functioning inside of 'Food Truck Alley'. </li></ul>
<p><i>Though we are striving for a food truck, we would love the opportunity to continue serving our crêpes inside of 'Food Truck Alley' at a designated indoor location on those not so sunny days or when winter comes, enabling us to generate income and service the public in a cozy spot.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE PERKS:</p>
<p>To show our gratitude and appreciation for your support we have a great lineup of incentives and patron swag everyone can get down with.</p>
<ul><li>Limited Edition T-Shirts</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494900381/russwgciaq9q7i4m7hee.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<ul>
<li>CCC punch cards. Depending on the donation amount you can get anywhere between a three to ten crêpe punch card. </li>
<li>Dinner and a show! And by dinner we mean custom crêpes at our house, and by show we mean you can watch us make it ... </li>
<li>Create your own crêpe recipe that we will feature on our menu</li>
<li>Your name engraved on our truck + a personal catering for up to six of your closest friends</li>
<li>We come to you and cater for up to 15 people</li>
<li>And for those big spenders, an entire catering event on us: wedding, business conference, babyshower, birthday - you name it! We'll travel up to 60 miles and cater up to 150 people. </li>
</ul>
<p>IF WE DON'T REACH OUR GOAL:</p>
<p>If we don't reach our campaign funding goal we still intend on opening the food truck, it just might take more time to figure out additional funding options to see the project through. What we <i>will</i> do with the funds we do raise is open a separate business savings account until we reach the amount we need to fully invest in the truck and all our startup needs. </p>
<p>While we are in the process of defining funding, we hope to sustain ourselves and continue spreading the word about CCC while being hosted inside of 'Food Truck Alley'. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As some may, or may not know, Colorado Springs is about five years behind national trends - if not more. However, it is sitting on a pile of potential not just with the promise it holds inside of its young entrepreneurs, but with the demand its market will hold [and does hold] for innovation and progress. Many people now understand the boom inside Colorado's real estate market, especially as it relates to Denver; but county lines can only hold so many. With the new RTD rail system beginning its build alongside I-25, it will only be a matter of time before demand for more diversity, inclusiveness, and culture spill over into Colorado's second largest city. We are well on our way, but it's inspiring to know that patrons like you can say ""I helped paved the way"" in creating an aspect of all these ideals inside a venture like this one. </p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While monetary contribution helps, it's not the only way to help get us started. </p>
<ul>
<li>Word of mouth is HUGE. Simply telling others about our project and what we are looking to do helps us tremendously.  You never know who might have an extra buck or two to throw our way or who might be in our neck of the woods and would like to support us once we do get the truck on the road. </li>
<li>SHARING IS CARING! Post this project on your instragram, facebook, twitter, snap story - whatever! The more buzz we can generate, the more awareness we generate -  not just for the purpose of raising  money, but for businesses like us that have a market sharing mentality. One of our main goals is to bring business back to its grassroots, emphasizing the importance of community as opposed to competition. </li>

However, after a few years of service she soon realized that flying wasn't her only passion. After spending nearly five months deployed in the Middle East, she started reminiscing  about her childhood in France, and how her parents always cooked homemade crêpes every Sunday evening for her family. Her profound passion for food then embellished so much she wanted to find a way to share it in a larger capacity.  ​
Upon returning home to the states Annie began to set her newfound passion  into motion. After many entrepreneurial workshops and countless hours business planning, the venture toward opening Colorado Crêpe Company would officially come to pass. 
 
Leah Shockley - CMO | Sous Chef ​

With over eight years of experience in the food and hospitality industry coupled with four years in marketing/PR, Leah is a diverse entrepreneur and one who is suited to thrive in the foodie world of gourmet food trucks. She has a strong passion not only for great food, but the nutrients that wholesome eats provide at the core.  
After her 2009 diagnoses of Multiple Sclerosis and three year battle attempting to find the right modern day therapies to combat the disease, her passion for healthy living grew exponentially. After many years of research she learned there was no greater medicine than the food we ingest to nourish our bodies. From that moment on she knew she wanted to develop a company that held her same values and saw them through in a big way.​
After meeting Annie, she quickly realized their passions complimented each other and knew they were on the verge of something exceptional. 
 
While we've managed to spread the love and our crêpes through catered events, we've barely scratched the surface of our community. We really want the opportunity to share on an expansive level. 
Soon we will be featured inside of a new culinary concept called ""Food Truck Alley"", a cute house on a decent plot of land in the heart of Old Colorado City. Here, food trucks located in the Springs can come and park for designated amounts of time during any given day while customers filter in and out. It is an inviting lot with streaming lights, music, and various food truck options to choose from. Because we don't own a food truck at this time, we are being featured on the inside of this space at the ""crêpe bar"" we built. This has been monumental for us and allows the public to experience our foodie culture as well as the wholesomeness we can bring to the table. Though this is an amazing opportunity, we are striving for more mobile capabilities in an effort to spread the Colorado Crêpe Company culture further than just our front door. 
One of our main business pillars is market sharing. We'd like to eliminate the harsh competitive structure that has been America’s capitalistic society and bring business back to its grassroots. We want to partner with as many community based businesses as possible, as well as gain insights from our customers for new ideas and crêpe recipes. We firmly believe this business belongs to the community as much as it belongs to us.
With the assistance from our donors and patrons we will be able to embellish upon our community driven mission, integrating our love and passion of healthful food inside an unparalleled mobile crêperie. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
We've done some serious research as to what type of truck we'd like to develop, the size, structure, components, equipment, and aesthetics. Here is the transparent list we came up with:
A truck 
We've found a fully renovated truck for about $48,000 and a skeleton of a truck for about $12,000 that will require a complete overhaul. We believe the later option will be more expensive and more work overall, but it provides us the opportunity to customize it and make it functional and fun for ourselves and our customers. 
Aesthetics
Once we have the truck, we need to make it pretty and appealing. This includes engraving our logo on the old barn wood backdrop, lining the rest of the exterior in sheet metal, and creating a fun plexi-glass window so you can see us in action when we are building your made-to-order crêpe.
Industrial propane crêpe griddles
While we currently have two commercial griddles, they aren't the proper grade or structure we need for continued service and demand on a food truck. 
Food storage bins/half size industrial refrigerator/mop sink
A no brainer here ... 
Generator and propane tanks 
In order to go mobile and stay mobile we need electricity and gas to function.
Startup capital for food inventory
This will be rather costly due to our strict  local, organic, and authentic food sourcing. We are estimating about $2,000 initial inventory cost. This includes seasonings, spices, beverage syrups, coffee, creamers, and all our staples such as flour, milk, eggs, meat, veggies, etc. 
Cooking supplies and service utensils 
Can't cook without spatulas, pots, and pans! And you'll need something to eat with, right? 
Website development cost and maintenance 
A business can't exist without a website these days. And building one costs a couple thousand at least, let alone the cost to maintain it! 
A modest marketing budget
We aren't talking billboards here. More like enough funding to run mini campaigns on social media, like Facebook and Instagram - $500 would be ideal to get us through the end of the year.
Permits and licenses 
It cost us about $1,500 just to get a catering license, which was minimal. Opening a mobile kitchen is a totally different ball game. PLUS, we will have to maintain both licenses in order to continue doing private caterings and servicing the public on our truck.
Added equipment expenses needed in order to continue functioning inside of 'Food Truck Alley'. 
Though we are striving for a food truck, we would love the opportunity to continue serving our crêpes inside of 'Food Truck Alley' at a designated indoor location on those not so sunny days or when winter comes, enabling us to generate income and service the public in a cozy spot.
 
THE PERKS:
To show our gratitude and appreciation for your support we have a great lineup of incentives and patron swag everyone can get down with.
Limited Edition T-Shirts



CCC punch cards. Depending on the donation amount you can get anywhere between a three to ten crêpe punch card. 
Dinner and a show! And by dinner we mean custom crêpes at our house, and by show we mean you can watch us make it ... 
Create your own crêpe recipe that we will feature on our menu
Your name engraved on our truck + a personal catering for up to six of your closest friends
We come to you and cater for up to 15 people
And for those big spenders, an entire catering event on us: wedding, business conference, babyshower, birthday - you name it! We'll travel up to 60 miles and cater up to 150 people. 

IF WE DON'T REACH OUR GOAL:
If we don't reach our campaign funding goal we still intend on opening the food truck, it just might take more time to figure out additional funding options to see the project through. What we will do with the funds we do raise is open a separate business savings account until we reach the amount we need to fully invest in the truck and all our startup needs. 
While we are in the process of defining funding, we hope to sustain ourselves and continue spreading the word about CCC while being hosted inside of 'Food Truck Alley'. 

The Impact
As some may, or may not know, Colorado Springs is about five years behind national trends - if not more. However, it is sitting on a pile of potential not just with the promise it holds inside of its young entrepreneurs, but with the demand its market will hold [and does hold] for innovation and progress. Many people now understand the boom inside Colorado's real estate market, especially as it relates to Denver; but county lines can only hold so many. With the new RTD rail system beginning its build alongside I-25, it will only be a matter of time before demand for more diversity, inclusiveness, and culture spill over into Colorado's second largest city. We are well on our way, but it's inspiring to know that patrons like you can say ""I helped paved the way"" in creating an aspect of all these ideals inside a venture like this one. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
While monetary contribution helps, it's not the only way to help get us started. 

Word of mouth is HUGE. Simply telling others about our project and what we are looking to do helps us tremendously.  You never know who might have an extra buck or two to throw our way or who might be in our neck of the woods and would like to support us once we do get the truck on the road. 
SHARING IS CARING! Post this project on your instragram, facebook, twitter, snap story - whatever! The more buzz we can generate, the more awareness we generate -  not just for the purpose of raising  money, but for businesses like us that have a market sharing mentality. One of our main goals is to bring business back to its grassroots, emphasizing the importance of community as opposed to competition.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We need a total of $18,000 to help with all of the body work, paint, interior (cooling systems, lights, etc.).

<h2>Dosanko restaurant started as the dream of Nathan and Akiyo Lowey.</h2>
<p>It has been in development for over ten years. Nathan was attending culinary school and he met Akiyo. We had a vision to open a restaurant but wanted to learn as as much as we could before putting it all on the line.

Akiyo learned to cook from her Mother and Grandmother, she also attended a collage in Hokkaido focusing on cooking, nutrition and Japanese tea ceremony. Akiyo then moved to Canada to advance her study in english. While she attended collage in Canada she worked in restaurants, starting in the kitchen were she eventually became the Chef.

My wife Jeanine is a fantastic wife and mother who also is an artist who quilts, paints, and designs clothing. In addition, we are avid tea and coffee drinkers who have an addiction to fun and interesting coffee mugs. We created Black As A Mug® because we grew tired of the mugs with the witty or inspirational quotes that often times will disappear after a few good washings. We became passionate about creating our own mugs; not only mugs but functional pieces of artwork that celebrate our culture, our beauty, our brilliance, our creativity, our determination, our resilience, and maybe most importantly, a celebration of us for being so damn dope!  ​ What We Need & What You GetWe are asking for your support to make Black As A Mug® a huge success! Let us tell you how you can help. The following will detail exactly where your donations will go:Our primary expense will be to have Black As A Mug® mugs produced.

<h3>Why do we want to do this?</h3>
<p>Basically for the fun of it.</p>
<p>We love our pub and our customers and we think this will be a really cool way to improve one and give joy to the other.</p>

<h3>So Who Are We?</h3>
<p>I'm Matt Otley and with my wife Gabby we run The Otley, on Forest Road, Trefforest. For the last 3 years we've been in the blessed position to run one of the most rewarding community pubs in the area and are always looking for new ways to bring more joy to the community.</p>
<h3>What do we need?</h3>
<p>We need £10,000 to fund the upgrade of the electric supply and to purchase a brew kit.</p>
<p>£2,800 for the electric</p>
<p>£7000 for the brew kit and ancillaries </p>
<h3>Why are we using crowd funding?</h3>
<p>We are using crowd funding to help us get this project off the ground as soon as possible. Without it we'll still buy a brew kit but it will take longer and it will involve dealing with banks (and who wants to do that?)</p>
<p>We've always been a community pub and we feel this is going a step further to getting the local community involved in all things beer. It can be a great process creating your own brew and we're really excited to be in a position where we can let people from the local community and further afield brew their very own beer.</p>
</div><div><p> </p></div><div>
<h3>What would be the impact?</h3>
<p>To be honest Not that much!</p>
<p>We're not doing this to become millionaires. The brew kit we're buying is quite small and humble. We're doing it because we're passionate about beer!</p>
<h3>So what do you get out of it?</h3>
<p>First and foremost, your local will become a Brew Pub, with some of the freshest beer in south Wales! But we will also be giving you some perks </p>

<li>Big launch party with food</li>

<h3>We want to share our beer with you!</h3>
<p>Beer is where Michael’s passion for the art of fermentation began back in 1995. From there he discovered mead which led to the creation of Moonlight Meadery.</p>
<p>With the help of our friends, family, and many loyal fans, Moonlight Meadery has become one of the top meaderies in the country. Now it is time we expand our offerings to include the world of malt.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Moon Brewing</strong> is here to bring you delicious, limited release, one-off beers… but we won’t be making any old beer - we will be making the oldest kind: braggots (beers brewed with honey in additional to malt and hops).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534272623/ntsvjsq7b6cx2sbnj0vk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By taking up to 50% of the base malt out of the recipe and substituting it with the same amount of sugar from honey, we can make some truly amazing brews with dynamic flavors you cannot get otherwise. We are going to make big bold Russian Imperial Stouts, IPAs, and Berliner Weisses among others.</p>
<p>We have our Federal and State licenses, we have a distribution network, and have a proven track record of doing what we have been told can’t be done.  We just need your help, as to do this right it’s going to take some money.</p>
<h3>Who are we? Beer geeks.</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534271974/umnn6osiiuoyq2vstmjl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our family has been making alcohol since the days of prohibition (shhhh, don't tell Uncle Sam), we still have the stoneware crock that Michael's great grandmother used to supply her ""tea room"" with beer.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We already have Federal and State Licenses and a Distribution Network covering 28 states... now we just need the beer!</p>
<p>With the way that federal and state liquor licenses are set up, we are unable to brew with malt in the same facility we use for our meadery. That leaves us with two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a Brewery: we can either build out a separate facility for brewing beer, or we can acquire a larger facility that would have space for us to make divided partitions for the brewery and meadery so that we can have both licenses under one roof. (This would also allow us to build a bar and bistro where we could host all your beautiful faces and serve full pours of beer, mead, and cider.) This would be $$$.<br/> </li>
<li>Contract Brewing: use our recipes to brew beer at another brewery's facility. This requires us to <strong>prepay for the entire batch</strong>. In other words, we have to buy the entire batch of beer before any brewing takes place. Not only is this is very capital intensive and requires a massive cash flow, but the laws limit how and where we can sell contract brewed beer too. We simply don't have the excess cash flow to do this right now.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's why we are here asking for your help!<strong> If we can reach our goal of $50k we will be able to contract brew our Russian Imperial Stout Braggot and sell it in both cans and on draft! </strong></p>
<p>The perks you see are either for vouchers of RIS Braggot that we will be making, for memberships that will guarantee you allotments of our limited release, one-off creations, or for classes that offer expert knowledge on brewing with honey and beer judging based on the BJCP Style Guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Currently there are only 7 states – NE, NH*, ND, OH, OR, VT and VA (and DC) – that allow direct shipment from a brewery to a consumer.

Beer is where Michael’s passion for the art of fermentation began back in 1995. From there he discovered mead which led to the creation of Moonlight Meadery.
With the help of our friends, family, and many loyal fans, Moonlight Meadery has become one of the top meaderies in the country. Now it is time we expand our offerings to include the world of malt.
Hidden Moon Brewing is here to bring you delicious, limited release, one-off beers… but we won’t be making any old beer - we will be making the oldest kind: braggots (beers brewed with honey in additional to malt and hops).

By taking up to 50% of the base malt out of the recipe and substituting it with the same amount of sugar from honey, we can make some truly amazing brews with dynamic flavors you cannot get otherwise. We are going to make big bold Russian Imperial Stouts, IPAs, and Berliner Weisses among others.
We have our Federal and State licenses, we have a distribution network, and have a proven track record of doing what we have been told can’t be done.  We just need your help, as to do this right it’s going to take some money.
Who are we? Beer geeks.

Our family has been making alcohol since the days of prohibition (shhhh, don't tell Uncle Sam), we still have the stoneware crock that Michael's great grandmother used to supply her ""tea room"" with beer.

Three main and fundamental reasons pushed me to make it: <br/><strong>-  water conservation <br/>-  soil conservation<br/>-  non-use of pesticides and herbicides and the drastic reduction of chemical fertilizers</strong><br/>I built the first prototype to make sure the project worked. </p><p>After many tests in 2017 I decided to build the second one, smaller (40x40x100 cm. / 15x15x55 inches) but much more complete, to adjust it for growing more than 20 different plants. The prototype has been working without stops for 15 months without problems, producing salads, basil, medical plants and more.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537765714/z4m9rdwtcb6hssleirlo.png"" src=""""/></p><p> So after spending almost 2 years building, modifying, testing and perfecting this project I am able to complete it, but I realized that alone I could not do it. <br/>Asking for help and financial support does not scare me either diminish me. I think that asking for help in the moment of need for something very important is a sign of sanity and humility. So here I am. <br/>I hope and I trust that people see like me the validity and relevance of the project and will want to support me to achieve it because they believe like me that the world can change and improve. Or simply because they like the project. <br/>And I trust that you will want to support me somehow.</p><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>I strongly wanted this crowdfunding campaign to be able to refine and improve Biolinebox, because I would like to put it into production and make it a product for everyone.</span></p><p><strong>Biolinebox would allow people to grow their own plants wherever and whenever they want without any effort and without any specific knowledge, with water and energy savings and above all NO pesticides and herbicides and NO GMOs.</strong></p><p>With Biolinebox you know where your vegetables and plants come from.

This focus pushed me to design and develop Biolinebox.</p><p>While working for the municipality of Monza (a 120,000-habitant city near Milan) in 2007 I presented a water conservation project for the city parks. After 2 years, I achieved the desired goal: approximately 34,000 cubic meters (1,200,000 cubic feet) of drinking water saved. <br/>This amount corresponded to 72% of the water used to irrigate gardens and parks and run fountains. Thanks to the commitment of a group of people who supported me, thanks to the alternative use of water, which otherwise would have been wasted, today Monza is a water-smart city.</p><p>When possible, we should always consider the use of alternative water resources.<br/>By using Biolinebox, we could take part in restoring the natural water cycle by reducing the use of chemicals and soils exploitation.<br/>Just think that the 75% of the water used in traditional agriculture is wasted by evaporation and polluted by persistent fertilizers and pesticides.</p><p>Using Biolinebox could give a real contribution to the reconversion of agricultural production and to the return of water and soil to the land. This would give a great opportunity not only to our lives but also to our planet. </p><p>We have to change direction and grow the future.<br/><strong>WITH BIOLINEBOX GROWING THE FUTURE IS POSSIBLE!</strong></p><h2><strong>Why I ask for € 200,000.00 and where I am going to go</strong></h2><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>This fund will be used to start and structure the company and to improve, refine and engineer the 2 starting prototypes for indoor growing:</span></p><ul>

This has been my vision from the beginning.<br/>The Biolinebox project includes in itself the opportunity to preserve the environment be-cause it is an eco-friendly product as its component are biocompatible, so for its whole du-ration and after, it does not affect the planet.<br/>Moreover, it also includes the opportunity to make us help the environment because it can be an alternative and environmentally friendly solution at a time when the rapidly growing world population with the growing use of pesticides, technology, and industry is impacting and damaging the environmental balances all over the world.<br/>A change can start from everyone, if each of us should make also a little part, we could make a big difference and make the change. <br/><strong>CHANGE THE FUTURE IS POSSIBLE!<br/>SO HELP ME TO GROW THE FUTURE WITH BIOLINEBOX!</strong></p><h2><strong>Technical specifics</strong></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537541435/msq1tcwvcrzdic505nw0.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537541866/jeqbbfy017fuidha5r6p.png"" src=""""/>                           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537541880/xhzeksonn91svl3fjpyu.png"" src=""""/></p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537126952/xp5c5q0soc8wrychtbwu.png"" src=""""/></h2><p>A continuous voltage of 24 volts powers Biolinebox, so you just have to connect to electrics, or to photovoltaic panel, wind farms or other energy sources.<br/>The energy consumption is measured on hour of work.<br/>As the vital cycle of plants can change from 18 to 12 hour of light, in the growth days Biolinebox does not consume energy for about 6 hours, in the maintenance days it does not consume for about 12 hours.<br/>Moreover, every layer is independent and can be individually managed, so it is possible to have a mixed energy consumption (growth layers and maintenance layers) having a medium consumption for about 14 hours.<br/>The software and the electronic system have been developed and adjusted to manage all the vital parameters of the plants.<br/>Therefore, in the future I am further going to develop this system to manage larger spaces such as large greenhouses and other situation that need to adjust and control the parame-ters.<br/>Biolinebox can be equipped with a water tank or can be connected to the water supply. <br/>The water tank can control the pH but does not filter, and it has the capacity to make the box works up to about three months. <br/>The water from pipes is filtered and stored in the water tank where the pH is adjusted for the best efficiency. <br/>Every layer has the micro fertilization setted for each crop. <br/>The cultivation of sprouts requires only water. <br/>The automatic system ensures the water oxygenation to avoid stagnation and other related problems.</p><h3>Technical specifics of supports and seeds</h3><p>In the small model you can raise the upper layer to increase the cultivation height up to 80-90 cm (31-35 inches) to grow plants such as tomatoes, hemp and ornamental plants. Support wires are included.<br/>For higher plants (over 1 meter/3,3 feet) and climbing plants I am going to design a medium and a large model with one layer, support wires and growth capacity up to 2 meters/6,6 feet. These models will be produced only after the production of the prototypes already described.<br/>Different supports for different plants allow growing plants from seed or from already ger-minated plants.

Simply and healthy.Biolinebox is a fully automatic aeroponic system for growing vegetables, aromatic herbs and plants wherever and whenever you want. Aeroponic means that water is sprayed on the roots by a regulated vaporizer.The system ensures an optimal growth according to the selected recipe simply in your home.The system advises you when the plants are ready to harvesting, but you can also harvest sooner or later, as Biolinebox keeps them in excellent condition for a good period of time.Save energy, money and time.Fast and safe germination, 90% water saving and 85% nutrients saving compared to traditional agri-culture.With Biolinebox you harvest the plants just before consumption. This means no intermediary be-tween you and the crops.Zero-kilometer products are good for you and for the environment.With Biolinebox a better way of life is possible.Flavor. Freshness. Health.Thanks to Biolinebox, you have high quality fresh vegetables, herbs and spices with the right con-tent of minerals and vitamins. No pesticides and no GMOs.The system controls water, air, light, vital parameters and nutrients for an optimal growth of the plants and this ensures flavor and freshness.Natural supports.The supports contain selected seeds ready to grow.The support are natural and biocompatible: biodegradable pods, recycled natural fiber cloths, bio-compatible substrates, depending on the type of plant and the desired size. Biolinebox recreates the different natural conditions for an optimal growth of the plants.A garden inside home.Biolinebox makes an ideal climate wherever you are. The software takes care of the plants for you, whether you are on vacation or on business trip.The led lights reproduce the daily cycle of natural light. Every layer is individually controlled so you can grow different crops at the same time.Biolinebox can fit every environment and need: you choose size and color. The inside can be completely visible or discreet.My story and why BIOLINEBOX is so important
I am Filippo Cabua and I am an agronomist graduated at the University of Milan in agricultural studies with economic and technical orientation and specialized in protection of the territory.  I am a freelancer and thanks to my experiences and technical skills in 2016 I started the aeroponic greenhouse project. Three main and fundamental reasons pushed me to make it: -  water conservation -  soil conservation-  non-use of pesticides and herbicides and the drastic reduction of chemical fertilizersI built the first prototype to make sure the project worked. After many tests in 2017 I decided to build the second one, smaller (40x40x100 cm. / 15x15x55 inches) but much more complete, to adjust it for growing more than 20 different plants. The prototype has been working without stops for 15 months without problems, producing salads, basil, medical plants and more. So after spending almost 2 years building, modifying, testing and perfecting this project I am able to complete it, but I realized that alone I could not do it. Asking for help and financial support does not scare me either diminish me. I think that asking for help in the moment of need for something very important is a sign of sanity and humility. So here I am. I hope and I trust that people see like me the validity and relevance of the project and will want to support me to achieve it because they believe like me that the world can change and improve. Or simply because they like the project. And I trust that you will want to support me somehow.I strongly wanted this crowdfunding campaign to be able to refine and improve Biolinebox, because I would like to put it into production and make it a product for everyone.Biolinebox would allow people to grow their own plants wherever and whenever they want without any effort and without any specific knowledge, with water and energy savings and above all NO pesticides and herbicides and NO GMOs.With Biolinebox you know where your vegetables and plants come from. This can be a great difference compared to modern crops full of chemical and synthetic agents, especially for people with allergies and intolerances.Moreover you can experience the wonder of seeing plants growing under your eyes.Finally, all this would help reduce the environment pollution and would encourage a lower consumption of water and land: -90% water consumption and -85% chemicals consumption (compared to traditional agriculture) would reduce eutrophication of fluvial and marine waters. Eutrophication is a real problem almost out of control that is causing the proliferation of harmful algae and the loss of biodiversity in lakes and rivers and then in seas and oceans.  It is time to worry and take care of our planet.Be an active part in something biggerWith your contribution to Biolinebox project, you would be an active part in solving the problem of water consumption in relation to the growing population, due to the urbanization and the climate and environmental changes that have been affecting our planet for years.Supporting Biolinebox project you make the difference in supporting on a bigger issue: optimizing the cultivation space and at the same time making the vegetables production efficient, to sustain the food needs of the ever-increasing population.On a large scale with Biolinebox new cultivable spaces can be created in disused urban areas or where the cultivation is difficult or not possible because of bad climate conditions or bad soil characteristics.Thousands of people would share and apply the zero-kilometer concept without affecting the natural resources of the planet.WITH BIOLINEBOX A BETTER WAY OF LIFE IS POSSIBLE FOR YOU AND THE PLANET!  SO HELP ME TO GROW THE FUTURE WITH BIOLINEBOX!The impact of the project on people and environmentToday water is also called ‘Blue Gold’ or Oil of the 21st century’ that means water is very precious. This focus pushed me to design and develop Biolinebox.While working for the municipality of Monza (a 120,000-habitant city near Milan) in 2007 I presented a water conservation project for the city parks. After 2 years, I achieved the desired goal: approximately 34,000 cubic meters (1,200,000 cubic feet) of drinking water saved. This amount corresponded to 72% of the water used to irrigate gardens and parks and run fountains. Thanks to the commitment of a group of people who supported me, thanks to the alternative use of water, which otherwise would have been wasted, today Monza is a water-smart city.When possible, we should always consider the use of alternative water resources.By using Biolinebox, we could take part in restoring the natural water cycle by reducing the use of chemicals and soils exploitation.Just think that the 75% of the water used in traditional agriculture is wasted by evaporation and polluted by persistent fertilizers and pesticides.Using Biolinebox could give a real contribution to the reconversion of agricultural production and to the return of water and soil to the land. This would give a great opportunity not only to our lives but also to our planet. We have to change direction and grow the future.WITH BIOLINEBOX GROWING THE FUTURE IS POSSIBLE!Why I ask for € 200,000.00 and where I am going to goThis fund will be used to start and structure the company and to improve, refine and engineer the 2 starting prototypes for indoor growing:
Small            40x40x140 cm / 15x15x55 inches
Medium        60x60x200 cm / 24x24x79 inches
with the contribution of professionals and specialized companies.Engineering the prototypes means moving from artisan stage (3-5 pcs. a month) to industrial production (5-10 pcs. a day).The real dream would be to produce them by my own, without turning to the large groups that would produce it for me. But only by collecting a very higher amount than I ask I could start with my own production.So if the crowdfunding campaign would go so well, I could produce Biolinebox by my own strength, otherwise I will make Biolinebox produced by a selected company. Some companies asked me to produce it, but before yielding to the proposal of large industrial groups, I want to try to do it myself, with your help, to apply ideas and to use materials that are compatible with the environment and its inhabitants.The road mapStep-by-step strategyStep 0 - Reached upDesigning of prototype with aeroponic technologyProduction of working prototype 40x40x140 cm. (15x15x55 inches)Designing of prototype 60x60x200 cm.

Thanks to my different skills in mechanics, electronics and agrarian, I will be able to face and solve the challenges and the problems of the project implementation.Until now, I already had to exceed many different issues and I did it, so I know what hard work means and I know that determination and perseverance can make the difference in having success. Now the issues to overcome is the economic one and then the environmental ethics.I hope to overcome the economic issue thanks to this campaign.The environmental ethics means to consider the responsibilities humans have with respect to the care of the planet. This has been my vision from the beginning.The Biolinebox project includes in itself the opportunity to preserve the environment be-cause it is an eco-friendly product as its component are biocompatible, so for its whole du-ration and after, it does not affect the planet.Moreover, it also includes the opportunity to make us help the environment because it can be an alternative and environmentally friendly solution at a time when the rapidly growing world population with the growing use of pesticides, technology, and industry is impacting and damaging the environmental balances all over the world.A change can start from everyone, if each of us should make also a little part, we could make a big difference and make the change. CHANGE THE FUTURE IS POSSIBLE!SO HELP ME TO GROW THE FUTURE WITH BIOLINEBOX!Technical specifics                            A continuous voltage of 24 volts powers Biolinebox, so you just have to connect to electrics, or to photovoltaic panel, wind farms or other energy sources.The energy consumption is measured on hour of work.As the vital cycle of plants can change from 18 to 12 hour of light, in the growth days Biolinebox does not consume energy for about 6 hours, in the maintenance days it does not consume for about 12 hours.Moreover, every layer is independent and can be individually managed, so it is possible to have a mixed energy consumption (growth layers and maintenance layers) having a medium consumption for about 14 hours.The software and the electronic system have been developed and adjusted to manage all the vital parameters of the plants.Therefore, in the future I am further going to develop this system to manage larger spaces such as large greenhouses and other situation that need to adjust and control the parame-ters.Biolinebox can be equipped with a water tank or can be connected to the water supply. The water tank can control the pH but does not filter, and it has the capacity to make the box works up to about three months. The water from pipes is filtered and stored in the water tank where the pH is adjusted for the best efficiency. Every layer has the micro fertilization setted for each crop. The cultivation of sprouts requires only water. The automatic system ensures the water oxygenation to avoid stagnation and other related problems.Technical specifics of supports and seedsIn the small model you can raise the upper layer to increase the cultivation height up to 80-90 cm (31-35 inches) to grow plants such as tomatoes, hemp and ornamental plants. Support wires are included.For higher plants (over 1 meter/3,3 feet) and climbing plants I am going to design a medium and a large model with one layer, support wires and growth capacity up to 2 meters/6,6 feet. These models will be produced only after the production of the prototypes already described.Different supports for different plants allow growing plants from seed or from already ger-minated plants. The supports contain selected seeds ready to grow: biodegradable pods, recycled natural fiber cloths, biocompatible substrates depending on the type of plant and the desired size.Every plant needs the right space and support to born, grow and live.                                  Different soils have different texture and features.Biolinebox recreates the different natural conditions for an optimal growth of the plants.The biological cloth allows cultivation without support, so it is recommended for tender and crisp sprouts and plants such as alfalfa, cat grass and little salads, to enjoy them in the first phase of growth (home use) or to germinate and transfer them in pot or garden (vivarium and farm use).In the video you can see the supports for salads. The provided supports are vacuum and just have to be placed on the top of the cultivation box. Different models of top are provided with the box. When you harvest the crop, you just have to dispose the support as compostable waste and replace it with the next one. The basket supports can be reused.You can grow different plants in the same cultivation box only if Biolinebox can match different recipes having the same growth plan.TECHNICAL SPECIFICS OF SUPPORTS FOR SEEDS AND SUPPORTS FOR GERMINATED PLANTS:TECHNICAL SPECIFICS OF THE CLOTHS: BIOCOMPATIBLE CLOTHS:BASKET SUPPORTS:2 different basket supports for plants with different growthEXAMPLES OF SEEDING AND GROWING:Where the fund goes if I don't reach the goalIf I do not reach the funding goal, every amount will help to realize a part of the project:-    with € 5,000 the company starts-    with €10,000 the prototype production starts-    with € 20,000 the prototype construction and engineering go onIf I overcome the funding goal, so I reach more than € 200,000, here below some possibilities:-    with € 10,000 more: development of 5-8 new plants study-    with € 20,000 more: the large prototype (200x100x200 cm) production starts -    with € 30,000 more: the large prototype construction and engineering go onWith € 1,000,000 I can produce Biolinebox by my own.Other ways you can help: make some noise and share the project on socials!If you do not have the possibilities to fund the Biolinebox project, you can help me sharing the project on socials as much as possible.Talking about BIOLINEBOX with as many people as possible can really make the difference for me! Among your contacts, there can be people who will really support my project.Please share BIOLINEBOX funding campaign by every tool you have!Thank you for your help and support!",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We feel strongly that everyone in our community should have access to the most nutritious foods around. Our goal is to make our vegetables accessible, affordable, and deliciously organic. Your contribution, no matter the size, is helping us expand and achieve our goal. Even a $5 contribution (less than a latte from Starbucks) makes a difference.</p>
<p>We have successfully grown our garden in size every year, adding on more land as we go. This has allowed us to start small and get good at specific crops before branching out. Our method of farming has positive impacts on the environment around us. We make sure to give back to the soil in compost and green manures what it gives to us in vegetables. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While we're excited to farm, we're also very aware that there could be potentially devastating obstacles ahead of us, and here's what those things could be.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The work load</strong>: While our work is noble, it's not exactly for the faint of heart. We believe that our upbringing and our work ethic suites us well for the task ahead. We're a young growing family, but have huge hearts and passion for this work.  In addition, if our Indiegogo campaign goes <i>above and beyond</i>, your contributions will allow us to explore the possibility of hiring a field hand to help us with the simple tasks of weeding or harvesting potatoes, beets, and so much more. While the costs aren't included in our campaign, we would need roughly $15,000 over our goal in order to seriously consider an employee. Donate now and guarantee success!</li>
<li>
<b>Crop failure: </b>Another reality of farming is crop failure.  Maybe it wasn't warm enough, maybe it was too rainy, maybe a plague of locusts was cast down. There are a significant number of contributing factors to crop failures, but through careful planning (currently taking place), we hope to curb and prevent as many of the potential crop failures we could encounter. Additionally, crop diversity and rotations helps prevent utter failure. Our seed list is comprised of over 50 varieties so that sustainability is possible. </li>
<li>
<strong>Injury:</strong> The very reason we live and work in the Yarrow Ecovillage is that there's a swelling community of helpers, neighbours, and friends who long to see each other succeed. Farming is not only hard work, it can be dangerous work because of machinery and heavy lifting. In the event of an injury, we have confidence that our community would rally around us and help our farm push forward towards growth and success.</li>
<li>
<strong>Study:</strong> ""Information is power."" While it's true that information can only get you so far, we strongly support the philosophy that we must learn from those who have gone before us. We are deeply indebted to the farmers who have come before us, as they've instilled within us a deep wealth of knowledge and information from mentoring us over the past 3 years. But, we will continue our studies along the way to best equip ourselves to deal with obstacles and challenges associated with farming and running a business.</li>

The work load: While our work is noble, it's not exactly for the faint of heart. We believe that our upbringing and our work ethic suites us well for the task ahead. We're a young growing family, but have huge hearts and passion for this work.  In addition, if our Indiegogo campaign goes above and beyond, your contributions will allow us to explore the possibility of hiring a field hand to help us with the simple tasks of weeding or harvesting potatoes, beets, and so much more. While the costs aren't included in our campaign, we would need roughly $15,000 over our goal in order to seriously consider an employee. Donate now and guarantee success!

Crop failure: Another reality of farming is crop failure.  Maybe it wasn't warm enough, maybe it was too rainy, maybe a plague of locusts was cast down. There are a significant number of contributing factors to crop failures, but through careful planning (currently taking place), we hope to curb and prevent as many of the potential crop failures we could encounter. Additionally, crop diversity and rotations helps prevent utter failure. Our seed list is comprised of over 50 varieties so that sustainability is possible. 

Injury: The very reason we live and work in the Yarrow Ecovillage is that there's a swelling community of helpers, neighbours, and friends who long to see each other succeed. Farming is not only hard work, it can be dangerous work because of machinery and heavy lifting. In the event of an injury, we have confidence that our community would rally around us and help our farm push forward towards growth and success.

Study: ""Information is power."" While it's true that information can only get you so far, we strongly support the philosophy that we must learn from those who have gone before us. We are deeply indebted to the farmers who have come before us, as they've instilled within us a deep wealth of knowledge and information from mentoring us over the past 3 years. But, we will continue our studies along the way to best equip ourselves to deal with obstacles and challenges associated with farming and running a business.

<h3>About OLIVERO - It's All Okay!</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Oliver Wong. I am from the historical state of Malacca in Malaysia. I was trained as a horticulturist and loves nature, thanks to my Biology teacher during middle school.</p>
<p>Since young, I have always loves to do things with my hand. My passion for Do-It-Yourself, DIY deepened when I bought my house and decided to do the house renovation myself.</p>
<p>Since 2016, I decided to make my passion my life. I invested in a lot of tools and machinery to built many of my house furniture's and started everything from the ground up.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided that a chopping board would be the perfect first product to bear my name.</p>
<p>The success of OLIVERO will be a testament for my passion in creating a product that is  unique, tough and reliable.</p>
<p>OLIVERO is here for the long run....</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u><strong>MY LITTLE BIT FOR MOTHER NATURE</strong></u></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533101567/uth3vhrco193uezm4fvs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>At OLIVERO, all my boards are made of reclaimed wood. It takes more times and dedication to make reclaimed wood a working piece. But, it is all worth it because <strong>NO MORE NEW TREES BEING FELLED! </strong>Something that I feel very strongly about.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u><strong>NORMAL JOINT VS OLIVERO JOINT</strong></u></h3>
<p>When building a wooden chopping board, the timber will need to be glued using wood glue. At OLIVERO, I only use food safe wood glue, approved by US FDA for indirect food contact.</p>
<h3><strong>NORMAL JOINT</strong></h3>
<p>When joining pieces of wood together, the below normal joint is used by everyone in making chopping board worldwide. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533118229/btunhl05mbhqipjenuda.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This normal joint is easy to cut and make. The strength of this joint is dependent on the adhesion of the glue alone.</p>
<p>Normal joint has more tendency to warp, twist and ultimately, failure of the joint.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>OLIVERO JOINT</strong></h3>
<p>My signature OLIVERO joint is harder to cut and make. It takes <strong>more time</strong> and <strong>accuracy</strong> to make this joint.</p>
<p>However, it is <strong>stronger</strong> because it not only dependent on the glue alone, it also rely on the <strong>strength of the wood</strong>.</p>
<p>Therefore, OLIVERO joint will have less tendency to warp and twist. This makes for a <strong>permanent success</strong> of the joint.</p>
<p>By making my chopping board using my signature OLIVERO joint, I believe it is the ultimate chopping board!</p>

<h3>About US</h3>
<p>Tenth Ward Distilling Company is a woman-owned micro distillery, located in the heart of downtown Frederick, Maryland.</p>
<p>Specializing in whiskey, brandy, seasonal liqueurs and absinthe, we pride ourselves on challenging traditions and by forging unconventional and off the cuff spirits.</p>
<p>Our Founder also know as the Boss Lady, has a background in environmental sustainability (learn more <a href=""https://www.tenthwarddistilling.com/about/#Sustainability"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>!) and a ton of work experience in marketing and customer service. She started Tenth Ward from everything she had in her pocket and is working her butt off to pursue the growth of her small business.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540040123/w64uw4kz1pgsiynp3g34.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>This campaign is so so so important to us because it will allow us to achieve our very awesome and very achievable goals in this expansion which are to:</p>
<ol>
<li>educate our consumers more about craft spirits through the development of our soon to be super weird and unconventional cocktail program and </li>
<li>fill more barrels! As investing in a product that needs to season and age can be the hardest thing for a distillery, especially when customers love our spirits so much that we can't keep up with demand!</li>
</ol>
<p>Wanna know more about how investment works?? Wellll... support to the cocktail lab and barrel program creates a snowball effect in our growth and sales. Which means that more $$ gives us the ability to offer more booze, in different forms, at a higher price and to meet a larger demand of thirsty customers.  That provides our business with the cash flow necessary to keep re-investing in more kick ass staff, fancier equipment and the ever so lovely local economy of Frederick, MD. </p>
<p>Funding Tenth Ward's expansion campaign also directly supports local agriculture (go farms!), our community efforts and the growth of our industry (yay more craft booze!). </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Do We Need??</h3>
<p>Tenth Ward is seeking $85,000 toward our master piece which will fund the following-</p>
<ul>
<li>Construction of a new bar designed for inventing scrumptious cocktail concoctions</li>
<li>Expensive equipment to support the cocktail bar like sinks, dishwashers, coolers, a draft line (yeah you heard it, cocktails on draft!)</li>
<li>Build out of a GIANT barrel room, at least giant in comparison to our current 1600 sq foot space</li>
<li>Infrastructure to support our giant barrel room such as trench drains, water filtration, mop sinks</li>
<li>More equipment to manage larger processes and heavy things such as fork lifts, pumps, etc. </li>
<li>And the best part- RAW MATERIALS! Grain, barrels, cider, yeast and so much more. </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>What Do YOU Get?</strong></h3>
<p>We don't want you to do this for charity! We want to thank you for your support with really cool things like branded swag. Take a gander at the funding options-</p>
<ol>

</div></div>","About US
Tenth Ward Distilling Company is a woman-owned micro distillery, located in the heart of downtown Frederick, Maryland.
Specializing in whiskey, brandy, seasonal liqueurs and absinthe, we pride ourselves on challenging traditions and by forging unconventional and off the cuff spirits.
Our Founder also know as the Boss Lady, has a background in environmental sustainability (learn more here!) and a ton of work experience in marketing and customer service. She started Tenth Ward from everything she had in her pocket and is working her butt off to pursue the growth of her small business.


This campaign is so so so important to us because it will allow us to achieve our very awesome and very achievable goals in this expansion which are to:

educate our consumers more about craft spirits through the development of our soon to be super weird and unconventional cocktail program and 
fill more barrels! As investing in a product that needs to season and age can be the hardest thing for a distillery, especially when customers love our spirits so much that we can't keep up with demand!

Wanna know more about how investment works?? Wellll... support to the cocktail lab and barrel program creates a snowball effect in our growth and sales. Which means that more $$ gives us the ability to offer more booze, in different forms, at a higher price and to meet a larger demand of thirsty customers.  That provides our business with the cash flow necessary to keep re-investing in more kick ass staff, fancier equipment and the ever so lovely local economy of Frederick, MD. 
Funding Tenth Ward's expansion campaign also directly supports local agriculture (go farms!), our community efforts and the growth of our industry (yay more craft booze!). 

What Do We Need??
Tenth Ward is seeking $85,000 toward our master piece which will fund the following-

Construction of a new bar designed for inventing scrumptious cocktail concoctions
Expensive equipment to support the cocktail bar like sinks, dishwashers, coolers, a draft line (yeah you heard it, cocktails on draft!)
Build out of a GIANT barrel room, at least giant in comparison to our current 1600 sq foot space
Infrastructure to support our giant barrel room such as trench drains, water filtration, mop sinks
More equipment to manage larger processes and heavy things such as fork lifts, pumps, etc. 
And the best part- RAW MATERIALS! Grain, barrels, cider, yeast and so much more. 


What Do YOU Get?
We don't want you to do this for charity! We want to thank you for your support with really cool things like branded swag. Take a gander at the funding options-

​$25 - Cocktail Voucher: $25 will get ya $30 worth of cocktails when our new cocktail lab opens in Spring of 2019

$50 - Swag Bag: $50 will get ya the hippest branded hoodie, and hat (valued at $60)

$100 - Cocktail Voucher + Swag Bag + Unlimited Tastings:  $100 will get ya all of the above, a set of Tenth Ward rocks glasses and unlimited tasting flights for up to a year.

$500- Barrel Investment: Your very own branded Tenth Ward barrel, with your name on it, the opportunity to join our distiller as he fills your barrel, 5 bottles of our first batch 1 one year released bourbon and invitations to exclusive barrel tastings.


The Impact
Still on the fence? Want to see the projections? Thanks to a super brilliant grad class at Hood College here in Frederick we've got some hard numbers for you. Tenth Ward's expansion will result in 

The move to an additional space of 5,500 sq foot (currently operating in only 1600 sq feet)

30,000 pounds of grain purchased in 2019
6 new staff hires
Distribution to 8 new Maryland counties with hundreds of new liquor store and restaurant accounts
A potential for 40% increase in sales on top of our already trending sales growth

4 year round barrel aged whiskies on the way

<p>meet craig and alison. we’re designers, innovators, and travelers.</p>
<p>we both love food. we often find ourselves in new cities, and while there are plenty of delivery options available, it’s not always easy to find vegan options in nearby restaurants.</p>
<p>this got us thinking. what if there was a food delivery app specifically for vegan restaurants?</p>
<p>so we decided to do something about it. which brings us to this moment.</p>
<p>get ready to have the best vegan food in your city delivered right to your doorstep. <strong>eat.life </strong>is (almost) here.</p>
<p>not only are we creating <i>the world’s first vegan food delivery app</i>, we plan to grow this internationally.</p>
<p>we are launching <strong>eat.life</strong> in london, and our goal is to eventually be available in all the world’s most vegan-friendly cities.</p>
<p>we have all the pieces in place to create this. now we need you to help us make this happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>what we need.</h3>
<p>our goal for this campaign is £150,000. this will get us started, and we are thinking big.</p>
<p>we are designing the app prototype, along with our brand identity and marketing. we aim to offer a complete customer experience, and we have an innovative marketing strategy that will get people hungry for our launch.</p>
<p><strong>eat.life</strong> takes you on a journey from the moment you open the app, all the way through to the first bite of your meal. we offer a memorable experience that will have you looking forward to your next order.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562940639/eb2eebvlwxkhuzz6gmjm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>we need to complete the design, planning, and build of the prototype. we are creating the customer experience from the ground up. we are doing this full time and we need to cover our expenses until we launch the app.</p>
<p>we need to hire a team to build the app when the prototype is complete.</p>
<p>we have designed wearable items for the <strong>eat.life</strong> delivery team, along with the awesome clothing and tote bags we have available as part of our campaign. we need to get these printed.</p>
<p>we have designed delivery boxes and napkins, and branded bicycles. when we launch, we need to make an impact. we need to cover these costs for the <strong>eat.life</strong> delivery team.</p>
<p>we are planning an incredible sensory experience that will be a part of our mind-blowing media launch in london. ticket sales will go towards the venue hire and catering costs, paying the artists involved, and we will provide the best experience possible for those attending.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562886683/insmsoqsqcawcfatqdks.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>the budget.</h3>
<p>we have done loads of research and calculations. the £150,000 we are aiming for is the minimum amount we need to get us up and running, and to launch as effectively as we can.</p>
<p>this amount will be enough to get us started. then it's up to <strong>eat.life</strong> to deliver the goods.</p>
<p>in case you're curious, here's a breakdown of what we'll do with the funds we raise.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563828864/pkqki5qkqlcx2hjtfxqc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>app prototype.</strong> we need to complete the <strong>eat.life</strong> app design and user experience. we are creating something amazing here. we're not cutting any corners, and we need it to be the best it can be.</p>
<p><strong>app development.</strong> we need to hire a team to build the app. we'll also need some time (and a team) to test it after it's built.</p>
<p><strong>marketing + PR</strong>. we need to make sure everyone knows about <strong>eat.life. </strong>this means we'll have to hire someone who can help us reach the people we need to reach.</p>
<p><strong>launch party.</strong> we're planning an incredible multi-sensory experience for you all, to ensure <strong>eat.life</strong> launches with a bang. we need to hire a venue for this and pay the artists who will entertain you for the evening.</p>
<p><strong>team gear.</strong> we've designed uniforms for our delivery team. this includes clothing, helmets, branded bicycles and delivery boxes. we've also covered the little details like napkins and packaging for <strong>eat.life</strong> deliveries. like we said, we plan to make an impact when we go live.</p>
<p><strong>streetwear.</strong> see those awesome t-shirts, hoodies, and tote bags in the perks? we need to print up a whole bunch of these to make sure there are enough to go around.</p>
<p><strong>platform fees</strong>. indiegogo takes a cut of the money we raise. it's 4% if we reach our goal and 9% if we don't. so we've budgeted around 8% for this, as it could go either way. help us reach our goal so we can spend the funds on <i>your</i> <strong>eat.life</strong> experience!</p>
<p>if we don’t reach our goal, we will do as much as we can with the funds we receive. we will prioritize what we need to launch the app with maximum impact, and will leave certain features for later if we need to. either way, we will use the money to create the app and launch it as effectively as we possibly can.</p>
<p>any money raised above our goal will go towards making the launch, app experience, and marketing of <strong>eat.life</strong> even bigger and better. </p>
<h3>what’s in it for you?</h3>
<p>if you have ever wished it was easier to order vegan food for delivery, this is your opportunity to help us make it happen.</p>
<p>first up, we are offering <strong>eat.life</strong> order vouchers. these will be redeemable as soon as the app launches in london.</p>
<p>we have a range of sassy shirts, hoodies, and tote bags available that will make you look good while supporting a worthy cause.</p>
<p>are you an early adopter? if so, we have something especially for you. grab our <i>early access</i> perk and be among the first to live the <strong>eat.life</strong> experience.</p>
<p>we are planning our launch party in london in april 2020. this will be an exclusive event featuring live music, excellent food, and a few surprises. you know you want to be there. avoid FOMO by buying a ticket.</p>

<p>that’s the dream, isn’t it?</p>
</div></div>","who we are.
meet craig and alison. we’re designers, innovators, and travelers.
we both love food. we often find ourselves in new cities, and while there are plenty of delivery options available, it’s not always easy to find vegan options in nearby restaurants.
this got us thinking. what if there was a food delivery app specifically for vegan restaurants?
so we decided to do something about it. which brings us to this moment.
get ready to have the best vegan food in your city delivered right to your doorstep. eat.life is (almost) here.
not only are we creating the world’s first vegan food delivery app, we plan to grow this internationally.
we are launching eat.life in london, and our goal is to eventually be available in all the world’s most vegan-friendly cities.
we have all the pieces in place to create this. now we need you to help us make this happen.

what we need.
our goal for this campaign is £150,000. this will get us started, and we are thinking big.
we are designing the app prototype, along with our brand identity and marketing. we aim to offer a complete customer experience, and we have an innovative marketing strategy that will get people hungry for our launch.
eat.life takes you on a journey from the moment you open the app, all the way through to the first bite of your meal. we offer a memorable experience that will have you looking forward to your next order.

we need to complete the design, planning, and build of the prototype. we are creating the customer experience from the ground up. we are doing this full time and we need to cover our expenses until we launch the app.
we need to hire a team to build the app when the prototype is complete.
we have designed wearable items for the eat.life delivery team, along with the awesome clothing and tote bags we have available as part of our campaign. we need to get these printed.
we have designed delivery boxes and napkins, and branded bicycles. when we launch, we need to make an impact. we need to cover these costs for the eat.life delivery team.
we are planning an incredible sensory experience that will be a part of our mind-blowing media launch in london. ticket sales will go towards the venue hire and catering costs, paying the artists involved, and we will provide the best experience possible for those attending.

the budget.
we have done loads of research and calculations. the £150,000 we are aiming for is the minimum amount we need to get us up and running, and to launch as effectively as we can.
this amount will be enough to get us started. then it's up to eat.life to deliver the goods.
in case you're curious, here's a breakdown of what we'll do with the funds we raise.

app prototype. we need to complete the eat.life app design and user experience. we are creating something amazing here. we're not cutting any corners, and we need it to be the best it can be.
app development. we need to hire a team to build the app. we'll also need some time (and a team) to test it after it's built.
marketing + PR. we need to make sure everyone knows about eat.life. this means we'll have to hire someone who can help us reach the people we need to reach.
launch party. we're planning an incredible multi-sensory experience for you all, to ensure eat.life launches with a bang. we need to hire a venue for this and pay the artists who will entertain you for the evening.
team gear. we've designed uniforms for our delivery team. this includes clothing, helmets, branded bicycles and delivery boxes. we've also covered the little details like napkins and packaging for eat.life deliveries. like we said, we plan to make an impact when we go live.
streetwear. see those awesome t-shirts, hoodies, and tote bags in the perks? we need to print up a whole bunch of these to make sure there are enough to go around.
platform fees. indiegogo takes a cut of the money we raise. it's 4% if we reach our goal and 9% if we don't. so we've budgeted around 8% for this, as it could go either way. help us reach our goal so we can spend the funds on your eat.life experience!
if we don’t reach our goal, we will do as much as we can with the funds we receive. we will prioritize what we need to launch the app with maximum impact, and will leave certain features for later if we need to. either way, we will use the money to create the app and launch it as effectively as we possibly can.
any money raised above our goal will go towards making the launch, app experience, and marketing of eat.life even bigger and better. 
what’s in it for you?
if you have ever wished it was easier to order vegan food for delivery, this is your opportunity to help us make it happen.
first up, we are offering eat.life order vouchers. these will be redeemable as soon as the app launches in london.
we have a range of sassy shirts, hoodies, and tote bags available that will make you look good while supporting a worthy cause.
are you an early adopter? if so, we have something especially for you. grab our early access perk and be among the first to live the eat.life experience.
we are planning our launch party in london in april 2020. this will be an exclusive event featuring live music, excellent food, and a few surprises. you know you want to be there. avoid FOMO by buying a ticket.
if you're feeling super generous, we will invite you up on stage at the launch party to thank you personally for your contribution, and we are also offering the opportunity to be credited as an executive producer of the eat.life app.
if you are forward-thinking and see the potential of what eat.life has to offer, this campaign is for you. this is only the beginning, and this project will continue to grow. be a part of the movement now, and be one of the people who helped to launch the world's first vegan food delivery app!


why the world needs eat.life
in case you haven’t noticed, the vegan movement is exploding all over the world at the moment. more and more people are ditching meat and dairy, and looking for ethical, sustainable, and healthy alternatives. new products and restaurants are popping up everywhere. this is not a trend... this is the future.
if you have any doubts, here’s some research to inspire you.
2019 will be the year veganism goes mainstream.  the economist & forbes
UK vegan population will skyrocket by 327% by 2020.  survey analysts at finder.com
the business of providing vegan meals is booming. the economist
in the UK, the number of people identifying as vegans has increased by 350%, compared to a decade ago.  research by the vegan society & vegan life magazine

why trust us?
we get it. you haven’t met us, and we are asking you to send your hard-earned cash to strangers on the internet -- in the hope that we will indeed use it to build the world’s best food delivery app.
although this is our first crowdfunding campaign, this is by no means our first project.
here’s what else we do. check out our other projects and get to know us. hopefully this will set your mind at ease before you send any of your money to this campaign.

<p>We thank you for your support, however due to the ever changing economy and the evolving world of COVID we have moved on from opening a brewery to fulfilling a new dream.</p>
<p>The dream of Stained Glass Wine House was conceived by us. A group of Air Force veterans, who as we travelled the globe, realized something was lacking in our community...A customer focused...Upscale, yet not pretentious environment that anyone can go to, devoid of judgement. We are sensitive to how COVID has changed the world, yet understand people must get out and enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>This is where Stained Glass Wine House satisfies that need. Our aim is to be the premier self-serve wine bar in the New Orleans Metro Area. Our business model is tailored towards modern dating, business professionals, as well as tech savy individuals.</p>
<p>Stained Glass Wine House will offer 300+ wines with twenty on tap, along side self-serve high end whiskeys, finally as a testament of loyalty to our community we will have four beers crafted by neighborhood breweries of Louisiana. All of these libations served in a COVID compliant environment, metered and distributed via a completely touchless system.</p>
<p>We hope that you will continue your support for us as we engage in this new endeavor.</p>
<p>And remember.....COVID friendly for now, neighborhood friendly forever!</p>

<h3>Let’s bury the hatchet on prohibition.</h3>
<p>Carrie Nation wielded a hatchet to smash saloons as the figurehead of the Temperance movement that would eventually lead to the 18th amendment and prohibition.

We’re brewing up classic styles of beer as well as a few thought provoking beers in our Hatchet Series. We’re located downtown in the old library that helped educate the community from 1975-2003. So if you’re hot for teacher, you may enjoy a few beers from our Library Series. It’s also an excuse to mix in a few witty library and education metaphors. </p>

<h3>Who is Just a Dash?</h3>
<p>My name is Stephanie and I started Just a Dash in 2015 with a focus on Cakes and Dessert Tables for Weddings and Special Occasions. Since then we have enjoyed tremendous growth while doubling business each year.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Covid pandemic, my husband was furloughed from his job and has been since. We knew we needed to pivot with the changing times as almost all of our events on the calendar started canceling or postponing. So we started creating meals and charcuterie boxes. We pivoted our butts off and have grown a very successful new program that we are so excited to take to the next level.</p>
<p>Your help would enable us to transition into a bigger space, allowing us to expand our menus and the scope of what we can do as a business.</p>
<p>Our goals include hosting open kitchen days with baked goods, providing consistent meal pickups and deliveries, increasing the frequency of our Tea Boxes, and maybe even offering on site tea events or special dinners.</p>

<li>Our fundraising goal will help pay licensing fees, buy equipement, and get the space ready to be used.</li>
<li>We have lots of great perks to choose from to help sweeten the deal. See what I did there? </li>

<p>Quality guests deserve quality cocktails and quality cocktails require quality ice (<i>try saying that five times fast</i>). </p>
<p>What’s wrong with that regular freezer ice you’ve been using, you ask?</p>
<p>Well, that cloudy crap melts quickly, diluting that masterfully made cocktail before your guest even takes their first sip. </p>
<p>It also has a bit of a stink to it. You know, that whatever-is-in-my-freezer-suddenly-is-in-my-cocktail type stink. Even whiskey can’t cover that up.</p>
<h2>Clear Ice: Up Your Cocktail Game</h2>
<p>Clear ice will up your cocktail and entertaining game. Not only does it look absolutely jaw dropping—</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472648559/epkmu08zm02qclf0cy27.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>but the same science that makes it look so good makes it far superior.</p>
<h3>Clear Ice Melts Slower &amp; Keeps Drinks Chilled Longer</h3>
<p>The secret is that clear ice freezes unilaterally in layers. Because of this it’s crystal clear and free of air pockets. Being a consistently solid structure of ice, clear ice has more composure than regular ice. It melts more slowly, diluting cocktails with less water, and keeps the drink chilled longer.</p>

<h3>Clear Ice Doesn't Dump Freezer Smell in Your Drinks</h3>
<p>And of course, since it doesn’t have air pockets, it’s not going to crack and dump any hideous freezer smells into that drink. And if your freezer is like most of us, that’s probably the best news you’ve heard all week.</p>

<h2>Clear Ice: As Easy as 1,2,3 with OnTheRocks</h2>
<p>Trying to DIY clear ice is time-consuming, labor-intensive and unfruitful. </p>

<p>Here’s a step by step process to achieve Gatbsy worthy creations.</p>
<h3>Step 1:</h3>
<p>Select a tray. When you purchase OnTheRocks, you will receive the following molds; sphere, cube and block. Pick one or the other or both (leave out for blocks).</p>

<h2>The Journey to Get to OnTheRocks</h2>
<h3><i>Dozens of Concepts—100’s of Experiments</i></h3>
<p>It all started with a question, as most great journeys do. Matt Verlinich—the maker of OntheRocks—was sitting in front of his TV one night when he saw an alcohol commercial that piqued his interest. The ice being used in the drinks was clear and appealing. It made the alcohol look even more appetizing. So, being the go-getter that he is, Matt asked himself, “How can I make clear ice at home?”</p>
<p>His initial goal was to recreate the perfection he had seen on TV. After doing extensive research and experimenting with different materials like discarded pieces of plastic and insulation, Matt realized that he could democratize the process and make it easier for others to use as well.</p>
<p>As the experiments began to pan out, he found that by combining the DIY solutions with enterprise-level solutions, he could create an affordable, no-moving-part solution. This would give him the opportunity to manufacture his creation to share with others, so that they could do it themselves and then pass on their excitement for clear ice to others. There were, however, some challenges along the way.</p>
<p>Matt created several prototypes. He moved from using containers and recycling existing parts to customizing his own solution that would be the best size and form factor for a customer. Using CAD and his experience from Tech Shop, Matt continued to experiment. His goal was to design a product that would be cost efficient, versatile and useful. This left him with a lot of small changes that needed to be made.</p>
<p>The tray and water reservoir were a trial. How robust or complicated did it need to be? Plus, manufacturability was the biggest thing. How could he design the perfect clear ice product to be as cost effective as possible?</p>
<p>The idea was to save the consumer as much money as possible. Matt’s designs went through dozens of iterations and designs as well as hundreds of experiments.</p>
<p>He enlisted the help of his friends in the Maker Community of Pittsburgh along the way receiving invaluable support and insight.</p>

</div></div>","Now Shipping - Buy OnTheRocks Today on the Indiegogo Marketplace! Impress Your Guests With a Simple, Beautiful Drink...OnTheRocks
Quality guests deserve quality cocktails and quality cocktails require quality ice (try saying that five times fast). 
What’s wrong with that regular freezer ice you’ve been using, you ask?
Well, that cloudy crap melts quickly, diluting that masterfully made cocktail before your guest even takes their first sip. 
It also has a bit of a stink to it. You know, that whatever-is-in-my-freezer-suddenly-is-in-my-cocktail type stink. Even whiskey can’t cover that up.
Clear Ice: Up Your Cocktail Game
Clear ice will up your cocktail and entertaining game. Not only does it look absolutely jaw dropping—

but the same science that makes it look so good makes it far superior.
Clear Ice Melts Slower & Keeps Drinks Chilled Longer
The secret is that clear ice freezes unilaterally in layers. Because of this it’s crystal clear and free of air pockets. Being a consistently solid structure of ice, clear ice has more composure than regular ice. It melts more slowly, diluting cocktails with less water, and keeps the drink chilled longer.

Clear Ice Doesn't Dump Freezer Smell in Your Drinks
And of course, since it doesn’t have air pockets, it’s not going to crack and dump any hideous freezer smells into that drink. And if your freezer is like most of us, that’s probably the best news you’ve heard all week.

Clear Ice: As Easy as 1,2,3 with OnTheRocks
Trying to DIY clear ice is time-consuming, labor-intensive and unfruitful. 
OnTheRocks, however, easily makes clear ice. All you need is water, a freezer, OnTheRocks and those dashingly good looks of yours.
Meet OnTheRocks


Trays (cube or sphere)
Water Reservoir
Insulation

Here’s a step by step process to achieve Gatbsy worthy creations.
Step 1:
Select a tray. When you purchase OnTheRocks, you will receive the following molds; sphere, cube and block. Pick one or the other or both (leave out for blocks).

Step 2:
Add the tray to the water reservoir, fill with water, add to the insulation foam, place OnTheRocks into the freezer.

Step 3:
Wait patiently (roughly 24 hours), remove the ice from the tray and blow your guests’ minds. It’s that easy.

How OnTheRocks Works
Icicles one of the many wonders of nature—the real mad scientist here. They are crystal clear and there’s a reason for that.
When they are formed, the water freezes in layers. This creates a clear form that is free from air bubbles that become trapped when ice is made in a freezer. When professionals make clear ice for sculptures, they use specially designed freezers with pumps that constantly circulate the water to mimic these conditions.
OnTheRocks recreates this process in your freezer. It’s specially designed to allow the water to circulate naturally without any moving parts. This keeps things simple and cost effective so that anyone can enjoy clear ice. There are no moving parts. No hubs, no gears, no toggles, no chisels and no problems.

<h2><u><strong>Our Story</strong></u></h2>
<p><i>How did all of this begin?</i></p> <p>“All it takes is $700 and a passion.” Unknown to me, this quote would fuel our start-up, Honey Moon Chocolates. Carmen Rossi, a successful entrepreneur in Chicago, was speaking to one of my marketing classes about what exactly it takes to start a business.</p> <p>Fast forward a month- It was a hot summer afternoon. Haley and I were on our way to Chicago. Something about traveling somewhere new stirred my emotions- bored with my current summer jobs and all that follows. I looked at Haley and asked, “Would you be willing to start a business with me?” We had no clue as to what our business was going to be- we were just excited to create something new. From where we started, being able to constantly adapt to who we want to be and not who we are has been incredibly important.</p>

<h2><u><strong>Honey Moon Chocolates</strong></u></h2>
<p><i>Bean-to-bar chocolate sweetened with raw, local honey.</i></p> <p>Honey Moon Chocolates was created by Cameron Loyet and Haley Lower with one thought in mind- to create. We began making chocolate as a hobby, but it snowballed into so much more. Our cacao is sourced from Peru, which is known for fruity and floral tasting notes. As we were striving to cut refined sugar from our own diets, we wanted to provide others with an opportunity to have healthier sweets. Honey affords us the opportunity to differentiate ourselves with a product that will create quite a buzz in the current cacao bean to chocolate bar industry.</p>
<p>Our process starts with a cacao bean. Roast, Crack, Winnow, Grind, Temper, and we have chocolate. These steps are the same as ancient cacao producers, and they allow us to shape a revolutionary bean-to-bar chocolate flavor using Organic Peruvian Cacao and local raw honey.</p>
<p>We have been refining our cacao production process since June of 2016, and we continue to learn every day. Chocolate is volatile, temperamental, and requires the utmost care.  </p>

<h2><u><strong>The Impact</strong></u></h2>
<p><i>Creating a healthier future.</i></p> <p>Although we are fairly new to the cacao industry, we have found that patience is the key to being successful. Whether it is developing a roasting profile for a new origin of chocolate or redesigning our logo. By frequently taking a step back, we ensure that our next step keeps our values and goals in focus.</p>
<p>Our main objective when we began making chocolate was to eliminate refined sugars. Natural sweeteners provide minerals and enzymes not found in refined sugar  and can also easily be traced to their source. The raw clover honey we use gives our chocolate an enhanced floral tasting note that is unparalleled to any sugar used today in craft chocolate.</p>
<p>When developing our chocolate, it was important to us to ensure that our product would be sustainable, both for the environment and our suppliers. Our cacao is organic and fairly traded in order to support cacao growers. All of our packaging- from our natural soy wax paper to our labels made from plant material and wood cellulose- is minimally processed, biodegradable, and compostable.</p> <p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Developing trust with our contributors, customers, and suppliers is the foundation of Honey Moon Chocolates</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494300496/azyqt57w2cs7ytqpvayu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><i>Hurdles we can’t jump without your help.</i></p> <p>There are many barriers to entering the bean-to-bar chocolate industry. Licensing our product and finding a full-time kitchen to operate out of has been our greatest challenge as a business. Renting a kitchen also requires a hefty general liability and property insurance plan, both of which are costly.</p>
<p>There are also challenges on the individual batch level. We take as much time as we can to develop a bar that is perfectly hand-crafted. For example, our signature 70% dark chocolate bar undergoes 48 hours of processing, grinding and tempering to reach its full potential. When putting this much time and effort into one batch, a lot can go wrong. Being a degree too high or a few too low can throw our whole batch out of temper and force us to start the process over.

Our unique perks give our contributors prime opportunities to support Honey Moon, try some of our chocolate, or even help us develop a new flavor! We hope to create a loyal following that will stay with us as we continue to grow.

 
The Impact
Creating a healthier future. Although we are fairly new to the cacao industry, we have found that patience is the key to being successful. Whether it is developing a roasting profile for a new origin of chocolate or redesigning our logo. By frequently taking a step back, we ensure that our next step keeps our values and goals in focus.
Our main objective when we began making chocolate was to eliminate refined sugars. Natural sweeteners provide minerals and enzymes not found in refined sugar  and can also easily be traced to their source. The raw clover honey we use gives our chocolate an enhanced floral tasting note that is unparalleled to any sugar used today in craft chocolate.
When developing our chocolate, it was important to us to ensure that our product would be sustainable, both for the environment and our suppliers. Our cacao is organic and fairly traded in order to support cacao growers. All of our packaging- from our natural soy wax paper to our labels made from plant material and wood cellulose- is minimally processed, biodegradable, and compostable. Developing trust with our contributors, customers, and suppliers is the foundation of Honey Moon Chocolates

 
The Pollinator Partnership
Protect their lives. Preserve Ours. The Pollinator Partnership’s mission is to promote the health of pollinators, critical to food and ecosystems, through conservation, education, and research. Signature initiatives include the NAPPC (North American Pollinator Protection Campaign), National Pollinator Week, and the Ecoregional Planting Guides.  
With each purchase of our chocolate bars (upon opening), we have pledged 20% of profits to the Pollinator Partnership. These donations can be redeemed by going to our site (hmchocolates.com/bees).  Note: donations/contributions with the Pollinator Partnership do not imply endorsement of our chocolate.
 
 Risks & Challenges
Hurdles we can’t jump without your help. There are many barriers to entering the bean-to-bar chocolate industry. Licensing our product and finding a full-time kitchen to operate out of has been our greatest challenge as a business. Renting a kitchen also requires a hefty general liability and property insurance plan, both of which are costly.
There are also challenges on the individual batch level. We take as much time as we can to develop a bar that is perfectly hand-crafted. For example, our signature 70% dark chocolate bar undergoes 48 hours of processing, grinding and tempering to reach its full potential. When putting this much time and effort into one batch, a lot can go wrong. Being a degree too high or a few too low can throw our whole batch out of temper and force us to start the process over. Our funding goal will allow us to purchase precise equipment to aid in proper quality control of all our chocolate bars. Overcoming numerous risks and challenges to-date has been the most rewarding part of establishing a bean-to-bar chocolate company, other than an unlimited supply of samples! Other Ways You Can Help
We are passionate about our chocolate journey, we hope you are too! If you’d like to help us achieve our goals, but can’t swing a contribution, please: Talk about our campaign with your friends, family, and coworkers- everybody loves chocolate ;)

<h3>Short Summary of How &amp; Why We Got Started</h3>
<p>When Nikki and Neil met 3 years ago they came to realize they had some big dreams, Neil wanted to open a Brewery and Nikki wanted to figure out a way to help give back to her community of Upland that she has been apart of for 15 years. We put our heads together and came up with a plan to combine both our passions. After many sleepless nights of figuring out a name and mission that would represent both our passions, we came up with <strong>RESCUE BREWING COMPANY</strong>. The word <strong>Rescue</strong> for us represents all the  <strong>FIRST RESPONDERS</strong> that run toward an event rather than away and put their lives on the line for a complete stranger or animal and they deserve to be recognized. </p>
<p>Soon after our project started, a long time friend of Neil's, Dave , found great interest in what we were doing.  Besides having a great passion for craft beer, he loved our mission behind it and wanted to partner with us.  A few months later, he packed up his things and moved to California from Colorado.</p>
<p>Location was also very important to us.  We didn't want to be just another brewery in an industrial complex.  We wanted to be in the middle of the community it served.   Historic Downtown Upland was exactly what we were looking for.  It had the quaint small town feel and that was the atmosphere we have been working so hard to provide... a home away from home.  The opportunity to open our brewery in Upland was very important to us.  Upland has been home to Nikki for 15 years.  3 of her 4 children still go to Upland schools.</p>
<p>Over the past 3 year, since the decision was made to open a brewery, Neil was busy studying the industry and fine tuning the craft while brewing countless batches of beer.  Meanwhile Nikki started coming up with other ideas for the brewery that could incorporate her passion. Her first idea was to make dog biscuits from the spent grains left over after each batch of beer Neil made. These are healthy snacks for dogs and she decided that all the proceeds from the sale of these biscuits will go to the <strong>UPLAND ANIMAL SHELTER</strong>. She along with many residents were very upset the shelter's funding was cut and this was a way the community can help. Once she started thinking of helping the animal shelter she thought of other animal rescues and all the fire fighters and law enforcement, the many volunteers at Steven Hope for Children, Foothill Family Shelter and many more. All these people who dedicate their time, money and resources to help others and never receive the recognition they deserve. Its Nikki and Neil's mission to do just that!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; How You Can Help.... Plus All The Great Perks!</h3>
<div><p>In order to be successful and open soon we need your <strong>HELP! </strong>We want our taproom to be a nice, respectable location that you will feel comfortable bringing your family, friends, dogs  or even holding your special event at.  Our location is just a little under 5,000 sq. ft and can accommodate up to 200 people. Although we don't serve food we are partnering with a few of the local restaurants on 2nd Ave. to deliver food to our location, as well as allowing you to bring in your own food. We will have weekly &amp; monthly events (trivia, bingo, painting parties), tv’s (for sporting events), music (live and jukebox), and games (board games, arcade games) for adults and kids. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is <strong>MONEY</strong>! In order to accomplish this task and be able to handle the volume of people from not only the day to day foot traffic but the events (lemon festival, irish festival, car show, Cinco de Mayo, Farmers Market, etc) that happen throughout the year in downtown Upland. In order to keep up with such a demand we need to purchase several more  <strong>FERMENTATION TANKS,  a KEG WASHER, and more SEATING. </strong> So far we have funded the construction and most of the equipment but we have run out of funds. Please help us so we can help make this downtown area great again! <i><strong>Please check out the perks we are offering,  you won't be disappointed!</strong></i></p></div>
<div> </div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our mission will impact everyone in our community and will give  recognition to our <strong>FIRST RESPONDERS</strong> by giving a portion of our proceeds from our beer sales, merchandise sales and fundraising events. We want them to know we appreciate and recognize that they put their lives on the line each and every day for us. You may wonder how we will be recognizing our <strong>FIRST RESPONDERS</strong> and the answer is...we will be giving a portion of our proceeds to each of the departments to be used for equipment their department may need, to help the family of a fallen hero, to help an animal rescue save an animals life or to rescue some from a kill shelter, or even to give some hope to a family in need. So the  bottom line is the more money we make, the more money we can give back! Not only will we be recognizing our <strong>FIRST RESPONDERS</strong> but we will be helping bring attention and life back to our Historic Downtown Upland. Our goal is to create a place that is kid friendly, pet friendly and pretty much a home away from home! So please come join us on this journey.  </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone is in a position to help financially but one way you can help is by passing this along to all your friends, family, and colleagues. The other way is to come in and visit us once our doors are open. Getting the word out to everyone and your help is greatly appreciated, <strong>THANK YOU</strong> in advance!</p>

Goats also create a necessary andnatural fertilizer for our crops. MEDIA COVERAGE“The global protein bar market is growing at a fast rate, due to the increasing demand among consumers for portable convenience foods, which is enhancing the protein bar market, specially in areas focused on allergen-friendly, non-gmo, low-glycemic, functional, and natural/organic categories."" (Mordor Intellegence)“Overall, about 75% of world’s pop. has become lactose intolerant."" (PCRM: Physicians Committee for Respinsible Medicine)“In 2014, the nation’s goat dairy herd grew 2 percent from the previous year, and producers reported a 15 percent increase in sales, which are continuing to rise."" (The Associated Press and USDA reports) WHO WE AREBeing a very on-the-go person while trying to stay fit and eat right is difficult as it is, but even more so when you can’t have just the normal stuff, such as cow dairy. The frustration set in to break out of the herd and I got to work creating a protein bar that was unlike any other. It was important to me to use functional foods and to find a suitable dairy protein source in order to not sacrifice the vital BCAA’s that our bodies need for proper muscle growth…goat whey metthose needs and so much more.We align with your values, and aim to un-frustrate the world by offering protein bars that are wholesome over hidden – rewinding food back to its core; that is, where food starts as food and ends as food…with NONE of the bad!  Corrine Konell, Owner of barNONE Protein WHAT WE NEEDGoal: $20,000We’ve got the team, and the recipes all set to go, but we need a crowd funding campaign push to help us launch two new bar flavors and hire distribution to get into stores in the US and Canada.
TIMELINE STRETCH GOALSAs a stretch goal... if we receive enough funding, we will launch a line of goat whey protein powders in both vanilla and chocolate. As a backer of our products, you will receive a sample bag of our protein powders, either in Chocolate or Vanilla. OVERVIEW & THANK YOUbarNONE Protein extends a HUGE THANK YOU to each of our backers who is as excited as we are to ‘un-frustrate’ the world with super clean goat whey protein bars!
RISKS & CHALLENGESbarNONE Protein has already broken the barrier by launching the very first goat whey protein bar to hit the market today with our very first flavor of Peanut Butter Chocolate Chunk. The initial ‘leg-work’ is done, and with our current relationship we already have with our co-packer we are confident that our new bar flavor production will transcend smoothly and seamlessly.While we are not immune to the fact that challenges could arise, we do realize that circumstances beyond our control could potentially delay new bar flavor production. For this reason, we have padded our fulfillment timeline a bit to allow for any possible delays. If our goal is not met, we will be formulating each of the bar flavors by hand in a certified test kitchen in order to meet order fulfillment. We will then use the funds we do receive to continue to help us reach our goal of creating and launching marketable new bar flavors very soon!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Toddy Shop by Hemant Kishore will be a contemporary remake of classic Toddy Shops located in Kerala, India (also known as the land of spices and Chef Hemant’s hometown). Known as bars for the common man, Toddy Shops are places for friends to join together and enjoy good spicy bar food and toddy, the signature fermented coconut drink.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create the United States’ first ever Toddy Shop in the heart of Las Vegas. Toddy Shop will be for everyone to come together and enjoy an innovative cocktail and craft beer program meant to pair with the spices and flavors of our South Indian cuisine. This Toddy Shop will be community oriented and inviting for all people whether it’s after work, for dinner, brunch or celebrations. Bringing a little South India to Las Vegas, we will give customers what is called the “Toddy Shop Experience” by serving food and drink just like they would in Kerala. We will keep guests in the know with the Toddy Shop Secret Menu, where our guests will receive text messages of limited edition menu items, and we will focus on sourcing sustainably and locally when possible.</p>

<h3>Die Geschichte hinter Zuckerfrey</h3>
</div><p>Du bekommst von uns Kuchen, Pralinen und alle anderen erdenklichen Süßigkeiten aus 100% gesunden Zutaten, die sinnlich schmecken, dich verwöhnen und dabei nicht nur nicht ungesund sind, sondern sogar deine Fettverbrennung und Denkleistung fördern:</p><p> </p><p><strong>Kommt dir diese Liste bekannt vor?</strong></p><ul>
<li>Erhöhte Fettverbrennung</li>
<li>Gewichtsverlust und besseres Aussehen</li>
<li>Reine Haut</li>
<li>Längeres Leben, weniger Krankheiten</li>
<li>Mentaler Fokus und gute Laune  </li>
</ul><p>Das sind nur ein paar der Vorteile einer gesunden Ernährung. Kein Zweifel: Jeder weiß mittlerweile wie wichtig eine gesunde Ernährung für unser Wohlbefinden (und unser Aussehen) ist.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Aber warum machen wir es dann nicht?</strong></p><p>Naja, ganz ehrlich: Es macht einfach keinen Spaß auf Sünden wie Schokolade, Kuchen und Co. zu verzichten. </p><p>Aber was wäre wenn es Schokolade oder sogar Torten gäbe die vegan, gluten-, laktose- und zuckerfrei wären, dich abnehmen lassen und trotzdem besser schmecken als ihr kalorienüberladenes Gegenstück? Ganz einfach: Es wäre ein Traum!</p><p>Und genau dieser Traum ist wahr geworden.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Warum gab es das bisher noch nicht?</strong></p><p>Die Antworten sind eigentlich ganz simpel, also lass mich dir eine kurze Geschichte erzählen:  </p><p>Hi, ich bin Manuel Gonzalez. Und wenn du mein Foto oben gesehen hast, dann wird dir eine Sache auffallen: Ich bin dick. Und das schon eine ganze Weile. Und ehrlich gesagt? Das nervt mich. Es nervt mich aber nicht genug, um auf meine Lieblingssüßigkeiten zu verzichten...</p><p>Da ich aber trotzdem gesund leben will, machte ich mich vor 3 Monaten auf die Suche nach einer Lösung. Und diese Reise brachte mich schließlich zu Björn (der Typ aus dem Video), mit dem ich seit einer ganzen Weile befreundet bin.  </p><p>Und es gibt (mindestens) 2 Dinge die Björn faszinierend machen:</p><ol>
<li>Er hat über 10 Jahre Gastronomie Erfahrung und kocht regelmäßig mit Sterneköchen die du aus dem Fernsehen kennst<br/> </li>
<li value=""2"">Er ist ein „Biohacking-Nerd“. Diese selbsternannten Versuchskaninchen experimentieren mit Dingen wie extremer Kälte, Hitze, Vitaminen, Mineralstoffen, etc. um ihren mentalen Fokus zu steigern, mehr Energie zu haben oder eben auch mehr Fett zu verbrennen.</li>
</ol><p> </p><p>Ich wusste, dass es mehr als „ich will abnehmen“ brauchen würde um Björn von meiner Idee zu überzeugen. Denn wenn er nicht grade mit Fernsehköchen zusammenarbeitet, kocht er bei den europaweit besten Caterern oder auf Kreuzfahrtschiffen…</p><p>Also überlegte ich mir etwas Anderes um ihn zu überzeugen. Warum gibt es eigentlich noch keine gesunde Fastfood Kette?</p><p><strong>Ich meine Mc Donald's und Co. sind an jeder Ecke... Warum geht das nicht in gesund?</strong></p><p>Das war die Vision die uns zusammenbrachte. Und das Bild einer gesunden Gastronomiekette treibt uns nach wie vor an.</p><p>Für uns ist das eine Sache für die es sich wirklich zu arbeiten und zu kämpfen lohnt. Etwas, das uns jeden Morgen aufstehen und strahlen lässt, denn wir sehen wie wertvoll das für Diabetiker, Übergewichtige (also auch mich) und auch alte oder kranke Menschen ist - oder solche, die einfach täglichen Genuss haben und trotzdem noch mehr Leistung zeigen wollen.</p><p>Björn war also mit an Bord. Und so feilten wir (naja, vor allem Björn) monatelang an den Rezepturen für unser erstes Pilotprojekt:</p><p> </p><p><strong>Das Café Zuckerfrey in Berlin.</strong></p><p>Wir testeten dutzende Versionen von Pralinen über Torten bis hin zu einem Brotaufstrich der verdächtig nach N*tella schmeckte... bis wir die Rezepte fanden die uns wirklich überzeugten.</p><p>Und über diese Experimentierphase wurde mir eines glasklar: Die Frage „Warum macht das noch niemand?“ hat eine ganz einfache Antwort:<u> Es ist verdammt schwierig.</u></p><p><strong>Das größte Problem ist es einen gesunden Ersatz für Zucker zu finden. Denn die klassischen Süßstoffe sind auch nicht viel gesünder (wenn überhaupt) als Raffineriezucker.</strong></p><p>Und selbst gesündere Süßstoffe wie Stevia haben einen riesigen Nachteil: Sie schmecken nicht wirklich nach Zucker, sondern haben einen „bleiartigen“ Nachgeschmack.</p><p><strong>Die Gleichung ist simpel: Kein gesunder Süßstoff = Keine leckeren und gesunden Süßigkeiten.</strong></p><p>Genau da kam Björn ins Spiel. Nach mehreren Monaten fand er eine Rezeptur die nicht nur wie Zucker schmeckt, sondern auch zaubert: Der Zuckerersatz in der Schokolade hat eine klinisch nachgewiesene kariostatische und antikariogene Wirkung! </p><p>Auf deutsch: Unser Zuckerersatz schmeckt nicht nur wie Zucker, sondern du könntest ihn sogar abends nach dem Zähneputzen essen und dein Zahnarzt würde dir sogar noch eine High-Five dafür geben, weil er Karies vorbeugt und deine Fettverbrennung anregt!</p><p>Das ist unsere Geheimwaffe. Von da an war alles andere leichter. Björn entwickelte die Rezepte für unsere Schokolade, die Torten und allerlei süße Wunder, wie zum Beispiel eine gesunde Schokocreme für die er die Zutaten extra aus Skandinavien(!) einfliegen ließ.</p><p>Ja du hast richtig gehört: Wir machen deinem N*tella-Glas einen gesunden, noch cremigeren Bruder.</p><p>Natürlich willst du jetzt wissen was genau in der Schokolade drin ist, daher hier die Wunderwaffe beim Namen: Xylit. Klingt neuartig - und ist es auch! Es gibt bereits ein paar Produkte mit Xylit auf dem Markt und die werden tatsächlich sehr gut angenommen, da sie mehr als ebenbürtig sind und das komplett ohne zusätzlichen Zucker!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Hier kommst du ins Spiel:</strong></p><p><strong>Wir haben die Rezepte… aber um das Café und damit die Produktionsstätte in Berlin zu eröffnen, benötigen wir deine Hilfe.</strong> Denn wenn wir all die Küchenutensilien, Maschinen und andere Notwendigkeiten kaufen wollen, dann reicht unser Geld leider nicht mal, wenn wir die Zahnfüllungen unserer Omas verkaufen… Dazu kommen Themen wie Mitarbeiter, Website, Werbung schalten und natürlich Patente, Anwälte und Steuerberater.</p><p>Aber mit deiner Hilfe können wir es schaffen. Das heißt es gibt dann nicht nur ein Café in Berlin, sondern du kannst die gesunden Schokopralinen, Brotaufstriche und sogar die Tafelschokolade zu fairen Preisen im Internet bei uns und sogar auf gängigen Webseiten wie Amazon, Ebay und Co. bestellen. Wie klingt das für dich? Mal eben für den Netflix-Abend eine Packung gesunde Süßigkeiten bestellen...

Cormack is a vibrant community that was settled by veterans just after the end of WWII, where weaponry was traded for farm tools.  </p><p>The brewery is located on the former family saw-mill of co-owner Robert Sutton. The mill was the family business for 25 years, before the downtrend in the lumber market forced it to cease operations. Newfoundlanders and Labradorians are known for being entrenched in tradition, but also notoriously hearty in the face of adversity. It is with this spirit that Crooked Feeder Brewing wants to contribute to the history of the region and breathe new life into the property.</p><p>Our focus is to create an uncomplicated and enjoyable craft beer of the highest quality; whether you’re a casual beer dilettante who enjoys a traditional blend or a craft beer aficionado who appreciates a hop infused finish, Crooked Feeder has a brew to excite your palate . Our goal is to not only reinvent simple and full flavoured craft-brewed beer, but to become an integral part of the local farming community.</p><p>To that end, and by brewing quality beers with high quality and locally sourced ingredients, we aim to develop a competitive edge in the Western Newfoundland microbrewery market.  As well, our brewing process byproducts are not wastes to dispose of, but resources with a beneficial reuse. Kettle trub will be composted to support our experimental hop field (or to give to a local hop producer) and, since the brewery is adjacent to a small cattle farm, the spent grains will be donated to the local farmer for feed.</p><p>The overarching goal is to create a sense of community, through craft brewing education, innovation, activities/festivals and community ownership.</p><p>We produce high quality craft beers that will be well received throughout the Province. Our first and foremost priority is to maintain the highest standards of quality in our beers.</p><p><strong>Why are we running this campaign and what do you get for your hard earned dollars? </strong></p><p>Plain and simple: we need to raise startup capital for a three-barrel brewery, and we need your help to do it. A three-barrel brewery would allow Crooked Feeder Brewing to begin small scale production of approximately 64 kegs per month that will service local restaurants, bars, and the local growler market. With the growth of a few employees, however, this small system is robust enough to produce upwards of 200 kegs per month. A small system will also allow us the opportunity to produce a wide variety of ""small batch"" beers. This array of beers will provide consumers with an ever changing variety of tasty brews.  </p><p>But hey, we don’t expect you to just give us money (unless you really want to), instead we are offering great perks at values ranging from $5 to $1000. Perk options range from bumper stickers to memberships to great brew day event packages. We have priced everything so that our perks give the backer full value for their money, as if we were already selling retail. Just check out the amount of swag and beverage vouchers included in the membership!</p><p>Our goal is $25,000 and these funds will secure financing for a shiny, brand new, fullscale,  three barrel stainless steel brewing system. If we don’t reach our full goal, there are still plans for simpler, less expensive equipment that will get the job done, but with a lot more effort. Make no mistake, Crooked Feeder will be providing quality craft beers to thirsty people in the area by the year's end!</p><p><strong>So why is the success of Crooked Feeder Brewing great for the area?</strong></p><p>Newfoundland and Labrador—like the rest of Atlantic Canada--is a culturally diverse province with a growing appetite for finer food and beverages. With the rise of craft beer appreciation in Newfoundland and Labrador, the success of new beer opportunities (specifically Port Rexton Brewing and the Western Newfoundland Brewing Company) proves that our province iseager to try new and better beer. The craft beer culture is improving here, but compared to many other provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador is still lagging behind in the number of locally crafted beers. There is currently an explosion in microbreweries in Newfoundland, and Crooked Feeder Brewing will be integral to establishing Western Newfoundland as a craft beer destination. Additionally, Cormack is a community in need of new and wonderful things to help create employment and tourist opportunities. The brewery and our future taproom will be will be two new opportunities that can breathe life into not only the tourist industry, but the community and region. We have our sights set high and we see no upper limit to the things we can achieve in Western Newfoundland.</p><p><strong>So where are we?</strong></p><p>We’ve set ourselves a lofty goal: begin producing great craft beers for the region by the end of October. While we initially underestimated the volume of work to achieve that goal, we have already passed the hurdle of environmental assessment and are well on our way with a revised end of year goal. This campaign will help provide initial funding to secure our pilot system which will allow us to fill the orders secured with the perks, put us into full production mode, and begin servicing the larger craft beer community.</p><p>So, buy some perks and get on board, become a founding member and together we can knock this project out of the park!</p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>Hey, we know money can be tight, but you can still support us in a very important way. Share this campaign with any and all off of your friends and acquaintances; tell them you believe in our project and to buy one of our awesome perks! Every dollar we raise will help move this project forward in Western Newfoundland. You can share straight from here on Indigogo! So please <strong>SHARE, SHARE, SHARE! </strong></p><p>If you need clarification on any of the perks, feel free to contact us through our Facebook page and we will be happy to help!</p></div>","Crooked Feeder Brewing who we are and why we are here!Nestled near the foothills of the Long Range Mountains, in the heart of the farming and logging community of Cormack, Crooked Feeder Brewing is establishing itself in the breadbasket of Western Newfoundland and Labrador.

Newfoundlanders and Labradorians are known for being entrenched in tradition, but also notoriously hearty in the face of adversity. It is with this spirit that Crooked Feeder Brewing wants to contribute to the history of the region and breathe new life into the property.Our focus is to create an uncomplicated and enjoyable craft beer of the highest quality; whether you’re a casual beer dilettante who enjoys a traditional blend or a craft beer aficionado who appreciates a hop infused finish, Crooked Feeder has a brew to excite your palate . Our goal is to not only reinvent simple and full flavoured craft-brewed beer, but to become an integral part of the local farming community.To that end, and by brewing quality beers with high quality and locally sourced ingredients, we aim to develop a competitive edge in the Western Newfoundland microbrewery market.  As well, our brewing process byproducts are not wastes to dispose of, but resources with a beneficial reuse. Kettle trub will be composted to support our experimental hop field (or to give to a local hop producer) and, since the brewery is adjacent to a small cattle farm, the spent grains will be donated to the local farmer for feed.The overarching goal is to create a sense of community, through craft brewing education, innovation, activities/festivals and community ownership.We produce high quality craft beers that will be well received throughout the Province. Our first and foremost priority is to maintain the highest standards of quality in our beers.Why are we running this campaign and what do you get for your hard earned dollars? Plain and simple: we need to raise startup capital for a three-barrel brewery, and we need your help to do it. A three-barrel brewery would allow Crooked Feeder Brewing to begin small scale production of approximately 64 kegs per month that will service local restaurants, bars, and the local growler market. With the growth of a few employees, however, this small system is robust enough to produce upwards of 200 kegs per month. A small system will also allow us the opportunity to produce a wide variety of ""small batch"" beers. This array of beers will provide consumers with an ever changing variety of tasty brews.  But hey, we don’t expect you to just give us money (unless you really want to), instead we are offering great perks at values ranging from $5 to $1000. Perk options range from bumper stickers to memberships to great brew day event packages. We have priced everything so that our perks give the backer full value for their money, as if we were already selling retail. Just check out the amount of swag and beverage vouchers included in the membership!Our goal is $25,000 and these funds will secure financing for a shiny, brand new, fullscale,  three barrel stainless steel brewing system. If we don’t reach our full goal, there are still plans for simpler, less expensive equipment that will get the job done, but with a lot more effort. Make no mistake, Crooked Feeder will be providing quality craft beers to thirsty people in the area by the year's end!So why is the success of Crooked Feeder Brewing great for the area?Newfoundland and Labrador—like the rest of Atlantic Canada--is a culturally diverse province with a growing appetite for finer food and beverages. With the rise of craft beer appreciation in Newfoundland and Labrador, the success of new beer opportunities (specifically Port Rexton Brewing and the Western Newfoundland Brewing Company) proves that our province iseager to try new and better beer. The craft beer culture is improving here, but compared to many other provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador is still lagging behind in the number of locally crafted beers. There is currently an explosion in microbreweries in Newfoundland, and Crooked Feeder Brewing will be integral to establishing Western Newfoundland as a craft beer destination. Additionally, Cormack is a community in need of new and wonderful things to help create employment and tourist opportunities. The brewery and our future taproom will be will be two new opportunities that can breathe life into not only the tourist industry, but the community and region. We have our sights set high and we see no upper limit to the things we can achieve in Western Newfoundland.So where are we?We’ve set ourselves a lofty goal: begin producing great craft beers for the region by the end of October. While we initially underestimated the volume of work to achieve that goal, we have already passed the hurdle of environmental assessment and are well on our way with a revised end of year goal. This campaign will help provide initial funding to secure our pilot system which will allow us to fill the orders secured with the perks, put us into full production mode, and begin servicing the larger craft beer community.So, buy some perks and get on board, become a founding member and together we can knock this project out of the park!Other Ways You Can HelpHey, we know money can be tight, but you can still support us in a very important way.

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Since I was young starting a business was something I wanted to do. No time beats the present. When I came back to my hometown of Portland I found an opportunity to coordinate events for a rapidly growing ice cream company. I was hooked on making people smile at special occasions and events. A treat can be tasty, but you remember the smile that handed it to you most. Portland is a vibrant city with a hunger for small businesses that go beyond the product to connect with people and the environment. So Simple will do just that.</p>

<strong>What do ""YOU"" do when you send your college student money for snacks and they buy everything but food?</strong> </h3><p>The Idea for College Snack Attack was born during my son’s first year away at school. I would send him money for snacks, but he would sometimes use the money for other reasons and still be in need of snacks. I needed a way to ensure that the money I was sending was being used as it was intended. How could I eliminate the hassle of searching for several snack items, packing and shipping a package every month? I needed something easy yet creative--more than a one-time chip and cookie option or the repetitive bulk buy of snacks. I wanted something that would arrive regularly but with a surprise element paired with encouraging words from the parents. After speaking with several parents and assessing their feedback, I knew College Snack Attack was the answer to our problems. College Snack Attack provides its subscribers with a curated box each month featuring new, traditional and international snacks.

It’s hard to concentrate in class or to focus on your studies when you’re hungry or worrying about financial obstacles. Whether due to nutritional deficits or the stress and distraction of dealing with financial hardship, food insecurity can compromise students’ ability to perform well in their classes. In extreme cases, food insecurity can force students to take time off from school or discontinue their education entirely.</p><p> 48% of students experienced food insecurity </p><p> 22% of students experienced extreme food insecurity </p><p> 44% were forced to cut back on the size of a meal or skip a meal entirely due to lack of money</p><p> 35% were hungry but didn't eat due to lack of money for food </p><p> 20% skipped eating for an entire day due to lack of money for food</p><p> 15% said they lost weight because they couldn't afford to eat   </p><p>The more buzz that is generated about College Snack Attack the further we can spread our message about alleviating food insecurity! So please, share this campaign with friends, family, and anyone else you feel would appreciate our mission.</p><h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES </h3><p>Any project has its risks—especially one that requires a large volume of upfront inventory.

What do ""YOU"" do when you send your college student money for snacks and they buy everything but food? The Idea for College Snack Attack was born during my son’s first year away at school. I would send him money for snacks, but he would sometimes use the money for other reasons and still be in need of snacks. I needed a way to ensure that the money I was sending was being used as it was intended. How could I eliminate the hassle of searching for several snack items, packing and shipping a package every month? I needed something easy yet creative--more than a one-time chip and cookie option or the repetitive bulk buy of snacks. I wanted something that would arrive regularly but with a surprise element paired with encouraging words from the parents. After speaking with several parents and assessing their feedback, I knew College Snack Attack was the answer to our problems. College Snack Attack provides its subscribers with a curated box each month featuring new, traditional and international snacks. The excitement is in the mystery of what your student will receive next! If you’re looking for the best snacks, we’ve got it!Each box is packed with a variety of indulging sweet, sour, salty, crunchy and savory snacks delivered to the student’s dorm mailbox each month.

We have, however, worked tirelessly to ensure a clear path to the target ahead of us.  When we reach funding for our base goal, we can start the official launch and production for College Snack Attack.

Food Insecurity is the lack of reliable access to sufficient quantities of affordable, nutritious food and has increasingly become an issue on college and university campuses across the country, potentially undermining the educational success of thousands of students.Food insecurity on college campuses has a negative impact on the educational experience. It’s hard to concentrate in class or to focus on your studies when you’re hungry or worrying about financial obstacles. Whether due to nutritional deficits or the stress and distraction of dealing with financial hardship, food insecurity can compromise students’ ability to perform well in their classes. In extreme cases, food insecurity can force students to take time off from school or discontinue their education entirely. 48% of students experienced food insecurity  22% of students experienced extreme food insecurity  44% were forced to cut back on the size of a meal or skip a meal entirely due to lack of money 35% were hungry but didn't eat due to lack of money for food  20% skipped eating for an entire day due to lack of money for food 15% said they lost weight because they couldn't afford to eat   The more buzz that is generated about College Snack Attack the further we can spread our message about alleviating food insecurity! So please, share this campaign with friends, family, and anyone else you feel would appreciate our mission.RISKS & CHALLENGES Any project has its risks—especially one that requires a large volume of upfront inventory.

Most importantly, the founders seek to support recently resettled refugees through community empowerment and financial assistance.  Recognized by... This cookbook was inspired by the Displaced Kitchens dining experience, a series of bedouin-style dinners cooked by recently resettled refugees, whom have transformed themselves into ""Chefugees"". These unique dining experiences are hosted by Komeeda since March 2017. After the Trump administration’s decision to halt admission of refugees from seven nations, Jabber Al-Bihani and his close friend and business partner, Nasser Jab, saw this order as an attack on the most vulnerable people in the world and took part to counteract fear and ignorance with hope and knowledge. Together, they formed Displaced Kitchens in order to shift the refugee narrative over authentic and gratifying dinners.Chefugee, Lutfi M. sharing his refugee story with the ""Kommunity"". Photo Credit: Sara Aridi #refugeeswelcome The Displaced Kitchens Cookbook will feature recipes and stories from refugee chefs who have been displaced by political conflict. Far from their native homeland, Chefugees share the enduring recipes that remind them of more peaceful times. Their stories of upheaval and survival provide the substance that makes cooking and eating the life-affirming act that it is that we all share. This cookbook will also illuminates the realities of the regional conflicts that our Chefugees fled from, and will outline the way food sources are affected in each area. In the Displaced Kitchens cookbook, we celebrate the communal nature of cooking and eating, and recognizing the rarely-discussed generative element of conflict: connecting the journey of displacement and cuisines that may have been lost in translation back into conversations —such as Middle-Eastern and Latin American food.  The book will feature two recipes per Chef from various countries experiencing conflict which includes: Syria, Yemen, Libya, Ukraine, Sudan, Venezuela, Iraq, Burma/Myanmar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Afghanistan. Your support of this cookbook will help Enrich, Empower, and Elevate our contributing refugees to establish themselves in their new home, America.  Your SupportTo date, with over forty (50) dinners attended by approximately 1,000 socially curious New York City foodies, our Chefugees have cooked and served authentically curated menus from Syria, Ukraine, Congo, and Yemen. Each and every dinner has left a lasting impression for the soul, and brought our attendees closer to understanding our Chefugee hosts' journey to America. In our current eco-system, we have worked with a diverse Kommunity of refugees and we are ready to make this cookbook the narrative-shifting tool that we will offer to enrich people’s lives, through food and shared human life experiences.Refugee host Lutfi, cooking up the lamb for his main dish, Makloubeh. Photo Credit: Luc Kordas / Metro NY In order to make this cookbook a physical reality, our $35,000 goal be broken down based on the following...Beautiful and meaningful creations requires a knowledgeable, experienced, and passionate team and we are aligning ourselves with some of New York City's finest minds to help us make a difference through this cookbook and we need your help!If we are to surpass our set goal, we have plans to our expand our impact! How?
Adding more Chefugee stories and recipes

Donating Displaced Kitchens cookbooks to non-profit culinary facilities and schools
  We have a commercial kitchen awaiting our project, Chefugees from Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and other beautiful places affected by conflict, ready to cook along with our passionate team; this book is destined to make the impact we envision it making across the nation! The ultimate ingredient that will bring this book to the tables and kitchens of hundreds, if not thousands of people around the world is YOU. Your support will bring us closer together to Enrich, Empower, and Elevate our Chefugees. It will provide a foundation for us to amplify the voice of the voiceless, who simply want to share their human spirit, give back to the world, feel welcomed by their new community, and most importantly shift the perspective of today’s refugee crisis.If you are unable to contribute monetarily, you can help us by sharing this campaign with compassionate friends, family members, and colleagues. The mere act of sharing on social media makes a vast difference. The Indiegogo sharing tools make it easy to spread the word about our promise to refugees. In turn, your worldview, as well as your palette will be enriched with this deeeeeelicious cookbook!Here are some of the gifts we will be sharing with our supporters!  Your Support Amplified! As we work more and more with refugees & asylum seekers, we are identifying the needs that are essential to getting them integrated into their new life here in America. Our “Kommunity” has been a resource in itself, delivering close to immediate results to help our refugee friends with empowering opportunities. However, we are also aware that this is not a readily available resource to many who need it. We are working on identifying a resource and/or align with an organization to train, inform, and provide streamlined and direct access to educational resources which include but are not limited to vocational training, education on western society, and societal integration assistance.10% of the proceeds from this campaign will go towards an initiative or organization that aligns with our mission. We will announce developments on that initiative in the coming weeks.  The ImpactOur cookbook will be as delicious-looking as the recipes it contains. With your help, we can design an art object that contains vibrant photos of culinary delights alongside portraits of our heroic Chefugees. You will want to display it on your coffee table or shelf when you are not bent over its pages, bringing one of the recipes to life. Through this cookbook our chefs’ stories and the range of spices that flavor them (from the most bitter to the sweetest) will amount to an immersive, thought-provoking (and, hopefully, action-provoking) experience for you and other readers. This is a written project that marks an immensely important moment in global history as it looks towards and promotes solutions and a peaceful, compassionate conclusion to human struggles by celebrating the most fundamental experience we share: cooking and eating. The recipes and testimonies shine a light on the narrative of the regional crises in the countries it highlights and brings people into those stories in the most tangible, sensory, and embodied way.Quest Love (best known as a member of The Roots and the House Bassist on the Jimmy Fallon show) perfectly described our mission when he wrote about Displaced Dinners on his popular blog, Quest Loves Food after attending a dinner: 
 The Team Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, the son to Yemeni immigrants, Jabber Al-Bihani is the co-founder of Komeeda, a marketplace for foodies, chefs, and restaurants to come together for meaningful and elaborate food experiences. He aims to redefine the culture of food using technology build a “Kommunity” who come together to experience food in a unique social way with a high level of substance. During an emergency family trip to Yemen in May of 2016, he experienced the life of a Yemeni citizen in a war zone for a mere week, and returned home to the United States forever changed and altered. The lack of infrastructure, stability, resources, and—most evidently—the absence of hope, struck him in contrast to the fruitful country he remembered from when he lived there for an entire year as a kid.Owner of Mazeish, Nasser Jaber moved to New York City from Palestine when he was 17 years old. After completing his degree in Finance & Economics, he began working in the food business, eventually launching Mazeish, a Mediterranean-Latino restaurant on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Nasser has volunteered to help refugees since 2008, mostly working with nonprofits that operate in the refugee camps in Lebanon. He has also written about technological advancements and food.Adam Yeremian is a filmmaker, producer, and investor whose projects have received awards at major film festivals and have been distributed internationally. ProMedia (a full service production and post production company), is thrilled to be part of this important and influential moment in history. As an American with Armenian roots, Adam has experienced first hand the result of what happens to a culture when other forces attempt to systematically displace a people . He believes in bringing the human element to the forefront of political controversy and that, regardless of one’s political views, any human who wants to live peacefully, productively and neighborly lives should have the right to do so. Thank You For Your Support! What Is Komeeda?FUN EATING EXPERIENCES!  A ""Kommunity"" of chefs, restaurants, foodies, influencers, and organizations who come together to experience food differently. We pride ourselves in giving people access to new tastes, new stories, and new relationships through #eatKomeeda  brunches, dinners, tastings, and culinary competitions. Our mission is to empower the culinary world to share their stories and mouthwatering food with foodies near and far!",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

Quite the opposite. I was a ballet dancer and I needed to maintain my 100-pound (or less) figure. So, I simply didn’t eat. How did I dance for hours on end without food? I pushed myself.

She talked of taking risks, saying the shit you want to say, taking care of yourself, expressing yourself, and of just being you.

<h2>A Heritage of Great Cuisine</h2>
<p>My name is Juan DiGiulio, and I am the chef and co-founder of <strong><i>Succotash--Feisty Southern Fusion</i></strong>. Please join me and my wife and partner, Sam, in launching our food truck in Durham, North Carolina!  I've been working in fine restaurants all over the South for 22 years, beginning with my own family's Italian Restaurant in Baton Rouge, La. back in 1987.  It has been my biggest dream to have my own establishment, specializing in unique and exceptional <strong>Southern Fusion Cuisine. </strong> That dream is finally becoming a reality!!</p>
<h3><b>Where it all Began</b></h3>
<p>Having been born and raised in Louisiana with its rich culture of great food, libations and celebrations, it should come as no surprise that I also come from families who LIVE to cook and eat! And that’s no exaggeration!  My most vivid childhood memories are of crawfish boils, large family gatherings, and time spent at my family's restaurant, DiGiulio Brothers Italian Cafe in Baton Rouge, LA.  My parents and grandparents are all very passionate cooks and I learned early on through their various approaches to Soul Food, Cajun and Creole, Italian, Southern Barbeque and Southwestern Cuisine.  I also spent 4 years in Mexico, cooking and also studying for my MFA and the food I create today reflects all of these great traditions!</p>
<h3><b>From Dream to Reality</b></h3>
<p>Though I've always wanted to have my own Restaurant, coming up with the capital has not been easy. When my father passed away suddenly almost 4 years ago, I did not expect that loss to open the door to my future.  As a complete surprise to me, my Dad, who had retired to Mexico about 3 years prior, had taken out a modest life insurance policy and I was the beneficiary.  He and I had bounced around the idea of opening a restaurant together for several years so I knew right away that I would spend the money to start my food truck!  After struggling with the banks and insurance company for almost 3 years, I finally got the funds to get started!  And to top it all off, after lawyer's fees and fluctuating exchange rates and taxes, the amount of the settlement was almost exactly the amount I needed to purchase the Food Truck that I had my eyes on!  Written in the stars?  Destiny?  I don't know but I do know that my Dad was looking out for me! </p>
<div><h3><strong>The Right Time and Place</strong></h3></div>
<div><p>Durham, NC, one of the most exciting, food-loving towns in the Southeast, is a restaurant owner's dream-town. Durham was recently named by <i>Southern</i><i> Living</i> magazine as “The South’s Tastiest Town.” And as many fine trucks and restaurants as we have, there are none offering Succotash's unique fusion of Southern flavor. I'm lucky to be here! And, I've been fortunate to have worked in some of Durham’s best restaurants alongside James Beard award-winning chefs at <strong>Nana’s</strong>, with Chef Scott Howell, and at <strong>Vin Rouge</strong>, with Chef Matthew Kelly, among other fine Chefs. By delivering fine cuisine ""on wheels,"" we will carry on the local tradition of great food by offering a feisty fusion of the best of the South. Opening a restaurant and having the opportunity to serve people the food that I love is the best way I know to give back to my cherished community.</p></div>
<h2>The Home Stretch: How You Can Help</h2>
<p>We've come so far--there's no turning back now! </p>
<p>We got the food trailer, and just bought the truck to pull the trailer!</p>
<ul>
<li>I have completely refurbished and upgraded the interior </li>
<li>We've purchased all of the cooking equipment</li>
<li>We've gotten our point of sale system and computer</li>
<li>We've registered our business name, Succotash</li>
<li>We've finalized our Menu and are in the process of pricing it for sale</li>
<li>Logo design</li>
<li>I've joined the Raleigh-Durham Mobile Food Association, whose mission is to promote the mobile food business in the region</li>
</ul>
<p>We are almost there,  but here's what's left:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Truck wrap—getting the trailer repainted with the logo</li>
<li>Truck/trailer inspection and certification</li>
<li>Insurance and registration</li>
<li>Food storage containers, pots, pans and utensils</li>
<li>Commercial-grade meat smoker</li>
<li>Food inventory and start-up supplies</li>
<li>Commissary rental and fees (where the food is prepared and stored each day)</li>
<li>Marketing materials and a special Launch Party to get this truck rolling!</li>
</ul>
<h3><i><strong>Your Support Makes the Difference!</strong></i></h3>
<p>First, thank you so much for reading and learning about our campaign. Your support is essential to our success. And to that end, we ask that you pledge whatever amount you can by hitting the “Back It” button. Also, for specific levels of contribution, you can receive some great perks, including food coupons, logo tee shirts and mugs, your name permanently tattooed on our truck as a supporter, and a print of Chef Juan’s original artwork!</p>
<h3><strong>Challenges</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>The biggest challenge for food truck vendors is the market. Luckily, we live in an area where new restaurants thrive and food trucks are in demand. There are food truck rodeos several times a year, neighborhoods and breweries that host trucks on a daily basis, food-truck friendly festivals, and a new permanent venue that serves drinks, hosts live performances, and hosts several food trucks seven days a week.</p>

</div></div>","A Heritage of Great Cuisine
My name is Juan DiGiulio, and I am the chef and co-founder of Succotash--Feisty Southern Fusion. Please join me and my wife and partner, Sam, in launching our food truck in Durham, North Carolina!  I've been working in fine restaurants all over the South for 22 years, beginning with my own family's Italian Restaurant in Baton Rouge, La. back in 1987.  It has been my biggest dream to have my own establishment, specializing in unique and exceptional Southern Fusion Cuisine.  That dream is finally becoming a reality!!
Where it all Began
Having been born and raised in Louisiana with its rich culture of great food, libations and celebrations, it should come as no surprise that I also come from families who LIVE to cook and eat! And that’s no exaggeration!  My most vivid childhood memories are of crawfish boils, large family gatherings, and time spent at my family's restaurant, DiGiulio Brothers Italian Cafe in Baton Rouge, LA.  My parents and grandparents are all very passionate cooks and I learned early on through their various approaches to Soul Food, Cajun and Creole, Italian, Southern Barbeque and Southwestern Cuisine.  I also spent 4 years in Mexico, cooking and also studying for my MFA and the food I create today reflects all of these great traditions!
From Dream to Reality
Though I've always wanted to have my own Restaurant, coming up with the capital has not been easy. When my father passed away suddenly almost 4 years ago, I did not expect that loss to open the door to my future.  As a complete surprise to me, my Dad, who had retired to Mexico about 3 years prior, had taken out a modest life insurance policy and I was the beneficiary.  He and I had bounced around the idea of opening a restaurant together for several years so I knew right away that I would spend the money to start my food truck!  After struggling with the banks and insurance company for almost 3 years, I finally got the funds to get started!  And to top it all off, after lawyer's fees and fluctuating exchange rates and taxes, the amount of the settlement was almost exactly the amount I needed to purchase the Food Truck that I had my eyes on!  Written in the stars?  Destiny?  I don't know but I do know that my Dad was looking out for me! 
The Right Time and Place
Durham, NC, one of the most exciting, food-loving towns in the Southeast, is a restaurant owner's dream-town. Durham was recently named by Southern Living magazine as “The South’s Tastiest Town.” And as many fine trucks and restaurants as we have, there are none offering Succotash's unique fusion of Southern flavor. I'm lucky to be here! And, I've been fortunate to have worked in some of Durham’s best restaurants alongside James Beard award-winning chefs at Nana’s, with Chef Scott Howell, and at Vin Rouge, with Chef Matthew Kelly, among other fine Chefs. By delivering fine cuisine ""on wheels,"" we will carry on the local tradition of great food by offering a feisty fusion of the best of the South. Opening a restaurant and having the opportunity to serve people the food that I love is the best way I know to give back to my cherished community.
The Home Stretch: How You Can Help
We've come so far--there's no turning back now! 
We got the food trailer, and just bought the truck to pull the trailer!

I have completely refurbished and upgraded the interior 
We've purchased all of the cooking equipment
We've gotten our point of sale system and computer
We've registered our business name, Succotash
We've finalized our Menu and are in the process of pricing it for sale
Logo design
I've joined the Raleigh-Durham Mobile Food Association, whose mission is to promote the mobile food business in the region

We are almost there,  but here's what's left:   

Truck wrap—getting the trailer repainted with the logo
Truck/trailer inspection and certification
Insurance and registration
Food storage containers, pots, pans and utensils
Commercial-grade meat smoker
Food inventory and start-up supplies
Commissary rental and fees (where the food is prepared and stored each day)
Marketing materials and a special Launch Party to get this truck rolling!

Your Support Makes the Difference!
First, thank you so much for reading and learning about our campaign. Your support is essential to our success. And to that end, we ask that you pledge whatever amount you can by hitting the “Back It” button. Also, for specific levels of contribution, you can receive some great perks, including food coupons, logo tee shirts and mugs, your name permanently tattooed on our truck as a supporter, and a print of Chef Juan’s original artwork!
Challenges

The biggest challenge for food truck vendors is the market. Luckily, we live in an area where new restaurants thrive and food trucks are in demand. There are food truck rodeos several times a year, neighborhoods and breweries that host trucks on a daily basis, food-truck friendly festivals, and a new permanent venue that serves drinks, hosts live performances, and hosts several food trucks seven days a week.
Our membership in the Raleigh Durham Mobile Food Association gives us access to the most popular food truck venues. We are also developing marketing materials to make our presence known. And we are starting to spread the word though Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

<p><strong>Did you know that Ohio has the best soybeans in the world for things like soy sauce and tofu? Like grapes for wine, the region has a major function in growing soybeans. The fertile soil and mild climate have created the best and highest protein soybeans in the country. over 50% of all Ohio soybeans are shipped to Japan, Taiwan and Korea for use in their products.</strong></p>
<p><b>Our soy sauce is unlike regular store-bought brands. Our process starts with small batches, using only the best soybeans and wheat, and combines traditional fermentation processes to extract bold and rich flavors. A high-quality soy sauce should elevate your favorite dish. When tasted the umami, caramel, and salty flavors should linger in a pleasant way. Unlike bigger brands our freshness is key. Our products are made 2 hours from their source. This means no chemicals or extra shelf-stable preservatives. </b></p>
<p><b>We're excited to share a couple of Indiegogo specific perks during this campaign. We are so lucky to not only have 1 but 2 high-quality ceramic brands in Ohio that will make this a unique promotion.

<h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p>Hello, Our names are Sam Pellerito and Kendall Holmes and we are the creators of CinSoy Foods.  In 2019 Sam started this experiment in his basement as a way to slow down, reinvigorate his passion for building things, and explore a food culture he always admired. From the very first bottle of bitter cloudy soy sauce, our path has been filled with the joy of learning, cooking, and sharing with friends and family. </p>
<p>Kendall joined CinSoy with a wealth of knowledge and a passion for experimentation. Together our goal is to develop unique products using local ingredients and share amazing ways to cook and eat at home. </p>
<p><u>DRIVEN BY CURIOSITY </u></p>
<p>Our desire to learn about culture through food has taught us a lot about the need for patience. We have come to realize that time cannot be controlled, and meaningful things take patience to create. The deepest flavors, like relationships, can only be achieved when you make time for them. </p>
<p><u>ENJOYING WITH FRIENDS </u></p>
<p>Creating new dishes made this experience even more fun. Taking insights from family meals and sushi taste testing, helped refine and improve our products while also creating new ones along the way. The effect this experience has on us added to the importance of food and community. </p>
<p><u>GIVING BACK</u> </p>
<p>It's easy to forget how important our impact is on the world around us. CinSoy is dedicated to ensuring our food helps serve a purpose. We donate one school meal to a child in need for every item you purchase. By working with One Feeds Two, we help children without access to fresh meals be more focused on education and class participation. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How Your Support Makes an Impact</strong></h2>
<p>All of the funding from this campaign will be used to purchase new machinery and help us build our space which will help support the growth of the business. This support will make a huge impact on our day-to-day.  We are so thankful and look forward to bringing you more amazing ingredients for your pantry!</p>

<p>- <u>Move into a bigger facility:</u> Things like barrels and fermenters take up space and sit for a long time! Your donations would allow us to move into a bigger facility. </p>
<p><u><strong>Stretch goal $40,000</strong></u></p>
<p>- <u>Processing equipment:</u> Items like filtration and packaging machines will reduce wasted time and increase consistency during production. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>The Loch Coffee Company was established in 2016 in Center City Midland, Michigan. Our mission is to create a safe, inclusive space for anyone and everyone, while also providing the best damn coffee we can make.</p>
<p>Our first location quickly became a local favorite and was featured in several magazines, including Great Lakes Bay, Driftless, and Barista Magazine.</p>
<p>Our establishment has gained so much attention and praise, our seats are frequently full, and it makes us sad to see guests walk out and try to figure out what to do instead.</p>

<h3>What We're Working On, and How You Can Help</h3>
<p>We're in the process of opening a second, bigger location downtown, but it's going to be very expensive.</p>
<p>We're looking to raise money for our equipment and our facility. The 35k goal only covers half of our expenses, so we will be using our own money along with contributions to cover everything</p>
<p>When you contribute to our project, you're helping us get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better equipment: espresso machine, grinders, refrigerators, waffle irons, etc.</li>
<li>A better facility: plumbing, electrical, floors, bathrooms, etc.</li>
<li>A better atmosphere: lighting, decor, speakers, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do not meet our goal of $35,000, we will still use contributions for the new shop, we will just have to prioritize certain items; we may have to settle without a piece of equipment for now, and buy it later.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We're Excited, and Why You Should Be Excited Too</h3>
<p>Our second location will be bigger than our current location, and since it's downtown, we will have the opportunity for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Longer Hours: Our plan is to be open 6am - 9pm Mon - Sat, and 9am - 6pm Sun.</li>
<li>More Food, All Day: we have a variety of artisan toast, salads, sandwiches, baked goods, and waffles already planned for the new location. No time restrictions.</li>
<li>Faster Food: We have a tons of new recipes and ideas for quick, amazing takeaway options for food in case you're in a hurry.</li>
<li>More Tea: We're continuing to use Rishi as our main supplier for tea, but introducing a secondary supplier out of Edinburgh, Scotland; Pekoe Tea, which will only be available downtown.</li>
<li>More Beverages: We'll be introducing a variety of artisan smoothies and blended drinks.</li>
<li>A Different Atmosphere: still The Loch you know and love, but with its own unique personality. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We're a Little Nervous</h3>
<p>When we first opened in 2016, we had a completely bare-bones, cold atmosphere. We spent all of our money on buying the building, repairs, and equipment, while putting the little that we had left into our decor. It left us feeling a little disappointed with our image. Over the course of two years, the shop is finally looking the way it should. This time around, we want to open our doors to a beautiful new cafe on day one.</p>
<p>Again, if we don't make our goal, this will still work, it just means we will have to make sacrifices.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5,000 - okay espresso machine, okay grinders, no refrigerated display case (which means no takeaway sandwiches or salads, limited baked goods), few refrigerators (higher risk of running out of product), cheap tables and chairs, bare-bones decor. This really wouldn't get us far.</li>
<li>$10,000 - okay espresso machine, okay grinders, refrigerated display case, few refrigerators, cheap tables and chairs, okay decor. We can work with this.</li>
<li>$20,000 - good espresso machine, great grinders, refrigerated display case, few refrigerators, okay decor. This would get us all of the necessary equipment.</li>
<li>$25,000 - great espresso machine, great grinders, refrigerated display case, few refrigerators, nice tables and chairs, better decor. This would get us all of the necessary equipment, and add a bit more to our decor.</li>
<li>$35,000 - great espresso machine, great grinders, refrigerated display case, plenty of refrigerators, nice tales and chairs, great decor. This is the ideal amount we would have for our equipment and decor, to create the space that's floating around in our minds.</li>
<li>$35,000+ - great espresso machine, great grinders, refrigerated display case, plenty of refrigerators, nice tables and chairs, best decor. Anything over 35k will just make the space look even cooler, and operate more smoothly.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have the extra funds to throw around, no worries. Here are some other ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share our campaign on social media! This will help us out so much.</li>
<li>Tell your friends and family about the new location.</li>
<li>Visit us at our current location on Dartmouth Drive.</li>
<li>Visit our new location, we can't wait to see you!</li>

<h2><u><i><strong>Coquette</strong></i></u></h2>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Coquette is a small business entirely run and operated by women.  Female empowerment is crucial for society to advance in a civilized way.  Individual servings of homemade strawberry shortcake layered in a Mason jar is served from vintage red triycles to residents and visitors to Montauk, New York.  Coquette merchandise including handkerchiefs, fans, pocket mirrors, clutch purses, fans, sarongs, beach towels, t-shirts and hoodies are also available for purchase.  Enjoying a homemade strawberry shortcake on the beach or after an outdoor concert is the perfect way to sprinkle a little more joy onto your day.  Women are involved in every process of this business from making the strawberry shortcake, selling it from the vintage tricycles to customers, marketing Coquette and sharing in the profits.</li>
<li>Financial independence is crucial to attaining a high quality of life.  By starting a small business, I hope to improve the lives of the people we interact with by sharing the delight of a homemade strawberry shortcake served from a woman riding a vintage tricycle.  My hope is that Coquette will be a great success and will allow for many women to get involved and share in the freedom that comes from greater financial independence.</li>
<li>Every donation matters!  Please contribute whatever you can because every little bit helps.  This particular business does not require a great deal of capital to get off the ground.  The positive impact of Coquette will be evident in the pleasant experiences of our customers and female business parters alike.  There is no other business like this on Long Island.  It will add to the local flavor and culture of this ocean side community in a delightful way.  Be a part of this positive addition to the Montauk experience and donate today!  Your support is greatly appreciated.  Thank you.</li>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Funding Goal: $6,000</li>
<li>This seed money will be spent on baking equipment such as an oven, baking pans, mixing bowls, an industrial mixer, Mason jars, ingredients and baking accessories.  It will also go towards the purchase of 5 vintage red tricycles that will be ridden by the Coquette team of women.  Additionally, the full company brand will be developed and introduced.  A website will be constructed and merchandise will be ordered.  Costs associated with obtaining a business license and all necessary permits will also be covered.</li>
<li>Coquette merchandise is completely unique.  You will be the center of attention while sporting your Coquette t-shirt, sunbathing on your stylish beach towel or keeping yourself cool with a Coquette fan.</li>
<li>Even if the ultimate funding goal of $6,000 is not reached, whatever money is raised will still be applied to the start-up costs described above.  All donations will contribute to purchasing the necessary equipment to launch Coquette.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Montauk is a quaint town nestled at the end of Long Island that attracts visitors from all over the world.  Many of them flock to the beaches during the Summertime.  There are not currently food vendors that supply any treats while beach goers enjoy the surf and sunshine.  Coquette will provide delicious homemade strawberry shortcake served by a woman riding a vintage tricycle.  Stylish Coquette merchandise will also be sold such as t-shirts, beach towels, sarongs, strawberry measuring spoons, embroidered aprons, fans, clutch purses, pocket mirrors and a fragrance developed especially for Coquette.</li>
<li>This is a straightforward business model.  It is a business that will immediately bring joy to the residents and visitors to Montauk alike.  It serves a current need in the community by serving delicious strawberry shortcake to beach goers that have limited food options while spending their day at the ocean side.  It will improve the lives of the women who run it.  Be a part of this impactful new business and make a donation today!  Your contribution is a crucial part of bringing this sparkling new business venture to fruition.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a seasonal business.  We are only able to operate the Coquette tricycle food carts on days when it is not raining or snowing.  There are also several months of the year when it will be too cold to operate the Coquette tricycle food carts.  By capitalizing on the current busy Summer Season in Montauk, we hope to have a strong business opening that will sustain us during the quiet Winter months and then be ready for a successful start in the Spring of 2020.</p>There will be a prolific marketing and PR campaign to ensure that the public knows about Coquette.  There will be special events organized to celebrate the launch of Coquette and to invite further financial support.</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Better than Learning by ordering at a bar</strong> - As a bartender I understand, there's nothing better than having someone do all the work for me! But when you order from a bar you have no idea what ingredients are making your cocktail taste the way it does. Now you know each and every ingredient to learning what makes the best cocktails for you!</li>
<li>
<strong>Better Than a Cocktail Class -</strong> With instructional videos and each step needed for your cocktail you have an entire class on your card! Except this is only a fraction of the price AND you can go back and reference each card whenever you want instead of forgetting how to make all the drinks you learned the second you leave the class! </li>
<li>

Go From Complete Beginner to Cocktail Expert -  Cocktail Cards is a perfect guide to teach you how to make professional-quality cocktails. Learn step by step how each cocktail is made and the techniques used by bartenders to create that perfect cocktail every time. 

Everything You Need On One Card - Each card will have a list of tools/glassware, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions to make each specific cocktail. No need to search the ends of the internet looking for the right way to make your favorite cocktail. 

Access to Instructional Video for Each Cocktail - Sometimes we need visual instruction and we got you covered! Each card will have its own unique QR code that will take you directly to an instructional video by simply pointing your camera phone at the QR code!

Learn the history of the cocktail - Relive history as each cocktail has an origin story and gives you a better idea of what flavors and techniques were most popular in that era. 

Organized to find your cocktail quickly! - In addition to an index card, the cocktail card set is also color-coded and sorted by alcohol type. Only feeling Vodka tonight? No problem! Look for vodka on the index card or scroll through the color-coded section and find a fun new cocktail with your favorite spirit!


      Front card shows history and image while the back card has step by step instructions.
- Perfect for creating cocktails with friends, a partner, or by yourself - 
 


Fun With Friends - Have company over and try various new cocktails. The flashcard format allows everyone to have their own cocktail card and start creating a cocktail masterpiece! No need to wait! 

Perfect for Datenight! - Impress your partner by creating their favorite cocktail and show off your history of the cocktail. It might go so well you could even get a second date night! 

Learn Your Favorite Cocktails by Yourself - Scared to order anything at the bar you've never had before. Well, now you don't have to spend $15 to test out a new cocktail!

- The easiest and most fun way to learn about cocktails - 
 


Better than Learning by ordering at a bar - As a bartender I understand, there's nothing better than having someone do all the work for me!

Now you know each and every ingredient to learning what makes the best cocktails for you!

Better Than a Cocktail Class - With instructional videos and each step needed for your cocktail you have an entire class on your card! Except this is only a fraction of the price AND you can go back and reference each card whenever you want instead of forgetting how to make all the drinks you learned the second you leave the class!

Books are stacked and damaged from getting wet, Cocktail Cards is a massive upgrade to your home bar!

<p>Pakistani Brunch Cafe!!!</p>
<p>Brunch is my favourite meal of the day and I enjoy making it for everyone and anyone. Luckily, I have taken after my mother and have discovered that I have inherited her cooking skills and would like to share this with others, but with a western twist.</p>

<p>This is not only about me starting my own business, it is also to make people realise that Pakistan is a lot more to what the media portrays it to be. We have fantastic food, we have amazing art, we have great music,we have creative and fabulous fashion and we have great people (like me ;) ). </p>
<p>I want to be a role model for younger (or older - its never too late) Pakistani women in whatever country they are raised in, to be proud of their origin and show that we can pursue our own dreams and not what is stereotyped for us. </p>

<h3>Help build a Chocolate Factory!</h3>
<p>Since 2005 Chocolate Tree has been creating a movement in Scotland to make luxury chocolate not only delicious and attractive but also affordable, ethical and organic. We currently operate from a small workshop which we have completely outgrown. Thankfully we are a sociable team &amp; love working with each other; an average day in our kitchen is a mixture of laughter and focused concentration from 8 unique individuals.

<p>We have our sights on a brilliant East Lothian location, the former <strong>Knowes Farm Shop.</strong> It’s a lovely open plan building that will enable us to continue making great chocolate as well as offering weekend workshops and tours.</p>
<p>We are aiming to raise as much as possible to invest in the buildings interior and expensive new equipment. The cost of the project will be closer to £80,000 than £30,000, and we will use additional sources of funding such as loans to make it happen. This is a long term investment into the future of Chocolate Tree and will enable a much loved East Lothian building to continue being used for an artisan food business.</p>

I’m <strong>Tiana Olivo</strong> and I have embarked on a journey towards the creation of a kombucha microbrewery, Bruja’s Brew. I plan to expand Bruja’s Brew into wholesale and retail sales. It’s been a great journey so far and it all began during my training at the Austin-based culinary school, <a href=""http://www.naturalepicurean.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Natural Epicurean Academy of Culinary Arts</a>. This schooling gave me the tools to learn how to brew kombucha and cultivated my kombucha obsession. I originally started making kombucha at home, experimenting with different flavors for months before I began brewing at Apple’s Austin corporate office for their multitude of employees. The kombucha was an instant hit and became widely popular across the campus, selling out almost every week. Seeing this reaction to my brew, I began to dream about having my own trailer with homemade kombucha on tap. From that moment I was focused on making my dream a reality.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535643377/aig9xetvctfzxrgou8sr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>From the time I left Apple to kickstart Bruja’s Brew, I created a solid business model and purchased a food trailer to bring innovative and unique kombucha flavors to Austin. Despite having clear goals for Bruja’s Brew in mind, I hit one major roadblock. I have limited financial resources to successfully turn this trailer into a brewery. That’s why I have turned to Indiegogo, and all of you wonderful people, to help me reach my goals. This trailer has the potential to transform kombucha (a commonly bottled and unknown drink) into a celebrated drink that brings people together for their health and happiness. I can’t wait to share the love I have for this drink with all of you.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535643787/rl1qn6hb03ogivdjligh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Your contribution to Bruja’s Brew, no matter the size, will help me spread awareness of the nutritional benefits and the deliciousness of this “magical potion.” Providing kombucha fresh on tap directly from the brewer allows the consumer to learn about the product and it's benefits to good health.

I’m Tiana Olivo and I have embarked on a journey towards the creation of a kombucha microbrewery, Bruja’s Brew. I plan to expand Bruja’s Brew into wholesale and retail sales. It’s been a great journey so far and it all began during my training at the Austin-based culinary school, The Natural Epicurean Academy of Culinary Arts. This schooling gave me the tools to learn how to brew kombucha and cultivated my kombucha obsession. I originally started making kombucha at home, experimenting with different flavors for months before I began brewing at Apple’s Austin corporate office for their multitude of employees. The kombucha was an instant hit and became widely popular across the campus, selling out almost every week. Seeing this reaction to my brew, I began to dream about having my own trailer with homemade kombucha on tap. From that moment I was focused on making my dream a reality.From the time I left Apple to kickstart Bruja’s Brew, I created a solid business model and purchased a food trailer to bring innovative and unique kombucha flavors to Austin. Despite having clear goals for Bruja’s Brew in mind, I hit one major roadblock. I have limited financial resources to successfully turn this trailer into a brewery. That’s why I have turned to Indiegogo, and all of you wonderful people, to help me reach my goals. This trailer has the potential to transform kombucha (a commonly bottled and unknown drink) into a celebrated drink that brings people together for their health and happiness. I can’t wait to share the love I have for this drink with all of you.Your contribution to Bruja’s Brew, no matter the size, will help me spread awareness of the nutritional benefits and the deliciousness of this “magical potion.” Providing kombucha fresh on tap directly from the brewer allows the consumer to learn about the product and it's benefits to good health. What I love most about brewing kombucha is being able to share this knowledge in a healthy, cruelty-free, and unique way. It is no secret that every business needs a solid source of funding to produce the necessary materials to begin. Thankfully, Bruja’s Brew requires a relatively low start-up budget. According to my calculations, I’ll need approximately $40,000 to get started. The bulk of this budget (64%) goes towards the food trailer that will be used as a vessel for selling kombucha, healthy shots, and tasty snacks. This 64% includes the cost of the trailer, a generator, taxes, insurance, equipment, paint jobs, rent, and utilities. Other aspects of the budget are included below.As a thank you for your kind donation, I am offering special perks featuring my original artwork. I have something for everyone’s style and budget, including stickers, hats, t-shirts, totes, koozies, and patches.

Additionally, when you are in the incredible city of Austin, you can choose to attend a kombucha mixology/cooking class or a private tasting party for two in the heart of downtown Austin. What a better way to invest yourself in Bruja’s Brew than to meet the witch herself!*Along with merchandise, the trailer will offer a simple yet intriguing menu. There will be roughly six rotating kombucha flavors that may change depending on popularity and season. Also on the menu there will be a variety of healthy shots and snacks.

<p>Having over twenty years of experience in exercise physiology and a former certified trainer, I have spent a vast amount of personal time looking for quality ingredients that are clinically proven to benefit many aspects of a person’s life. This view became more compelling once I became a volunteer and got involved with special needs athletes and as a volunteer for a hospice organization visiting patients with neurodegenerative diseases. More often than not, I saw many individuals and groups consuming large quantities of refined sugars, processed foods, and other clearly defined unhealthy perishables that do not improve a person’s overall health. This led me spending time and significant research looking for short and long term energy boosting ingredients that can complement a person’s overall health, body, and mind. Therefore, all Cross Energy products will be very nutritious, sugar free, and gluten free. My passion along with certifications, educational degrees and experience in exercise physiology, pharmaceutical and clinical research, finance, and most recently, the completion of a Master’s Degree, truly add to my professional expertise. Lastly, please be sure to view the doctor testimonial of all the clinical research performed.  This information is found in the video that follows the next section of endorsements. </p>

<h3>The Journey to Real, Sustainable Food</h3>
<p>Soooo this is where we're at – we're taking a gamble and putting our names out there and our hearts on the line. We're excited and terrified in equal measure. This is a first campaign for us and we'd love you to join in the fun and join us on our chocolatey mission to prove that real, sustainable food is the way forward.</p>
<p>At the moment our team of chocolate fairies are hand crafting their chocolate creations in a little workshop in rural Warwickshire (it smells amazing!). We love it here and have built fantastic relationships with our suppliers, many of whom are local artisan businesses with fab products just like ourselves. But in order to be serious and share the chocolate love more widely we're looking to kit ourselves out properly for the task at hand – making great tasting, fun chocolates from real and sustainable ingredients and proving that this is a viable way to run a business. </p>
<p>The funding raised from this campaign will be used alongside our own investment to help us develop and expand our production capacity to enable us to price more competitively for our loyal customers and other businesses. We have a fabulous team of 'chocolate fairies' who are absolutely passionate about bringing real food and chocolate skills to the UK and we'd love to let them unfurl their wings and share their love of chocolate with a wider market which we simply can't do with our current setup.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need and what you get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise £20,000 to invest in equipment to support the new machinery that we've purchased for the business. This will enable us to price more competitively so that food made from real ingredients is a more widely available and viable alternative for chocoholics and businesses to purchase. Every penny that we receive through the campaign will be invested in better facilities for chocolate making using real, sustainably sourced ingredients that your grandmother would understand from reading the label.</p>
<p>We're rewarding our backers with options that have never been offered before, aren't available elsewhere and are completely unique to Henley Chocolates. We're excited to fulfil them and to get started in sharing the chocolate love.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Once funding is received the funds will be invested in a number of different items to complement the new machinery and support our workshop growth. Your rewards will be completed and fulfilled as soon as possible. We will then be in a position to market our new, bespoke, chocolate products and develop the business in to an artisan chocolate brand that can bring about real change to growers, suppliers, customers and our local community in a very positive way. This campaign has the possibility to change lives for the better.</p>
<p>We built our little chocolate enterprise from scratch on the kitchen table and, now come to realise that our dreams of real, sustainable chocolate having a genuine place in the chocolate market were closer than we could ever have possibly imagined. About five years in to the project Sally (the boss) conceded that maybe it wasn't a hobby after all and perhaps, possibly, it was a 'proper' business that might be able to seriously work as an agent for good in the cocoa industry and beyond.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know this is a big task and change to an industry established over the last hundred and fifty years can't happen overnight. What we hope, however, is that by proving that real ingredients made in to fabulous food in an environmentally conscious way can be scaled in a commercially viable way without losing the heart of their beliefs.</p>
<p>Our biggest risk is falling flat on our face, not raising adequate funding and looking a little bit silly. It always feels vulnerable to put your neck above the parapet and say that you'd like to see change but we're so sure that this is the way forward we're prepared to put ourselves out there and go for it. </p>
<p>We've got a business plan to support the changes we'd like to see and we're happy to share it with anyone interested. We think accountability is pretty critical to what we're trying to achieve. We've built this business from the ground up with incredibly limited investment and we're really excited about the possibility of it achieving it's full potential - just like our chocolate fairies spreading their wings to fly.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that some people aren't in a position to contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help. Obviously donations are very welcome to help us achieve our goals but we'd also love your support in sharing this page on your social media, joining our mailing list to keep up with the project <a href=""https://www.henleychocolates.co.uk/mailing-list.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here </a>and spreading the word to friends and family. We'd love to have you on board!</p>
<p>If you've got any questions please shout out - we're happy to answer and share the chocolate love!!</p>

<p><strong>What makes us different.</strong></p>
<p>Distilleries and breweries are steadily raising the standard by which to make the consumer experience unique. The ideology behind Local Goat Distillery is no different. Expect an adventurous, yet gentle climate led by owners, Roger and Jessica Wall. Beyond the gin and tonic will be tours and a bar side experience that is refreshingly proper and at the same time, relaxed. The exclusively homemade craft cocktails designed by a master mixologist will complement the upscale bar design intended to resonate with customers as a memorable experience.</p>
<p><br/>Roger’s process inspires the socially spontaneous nature of Local Goat Distillery. Local Goat has partnered with nearby businesses such as Veldhuizen Cheese in Dublin and Bluffdale Vineyards. Roger will use the leftover whey from Veldhuizen as the base for Local Goat vodkas. As milk is a natural sugar, this works well for the distillery’s intentions. With Bluffdale Vineyards, Roger and Jessica have agreed to use the winery’s surplus to make a traditional grappa blend, much like brandy. Processes like these are only the beginning of Local Goat. They look forward to shooting recipes around for sorghum, pecan and even acorn whiskey. As well as using socially responsible practices, they invite local farmers and artisans to sell their wares in a location that is central and provides covered areas, as well as parking.</p>

<h3>About GVBC</h3>
<p>A love of craft beer, the outdoors and West Virginia came perfectly together in the creation of Greenbrier Valley Brewing Company in 2014.  If you're reading this chances are you are a lover of one or all of those too.  Welcome to the club.  Our motto ""Get out. Explore. Bring beer."" fuels our mission of bringing folks like you fantastic beers to take everywhere. </p>
<p>The last three years have been incredible. We've gone from brewing small batch beers to creating award winning favorites like Devil Anse IPA, Mothman Black IPA and Wild Trail Pale Ale. We started out by kegging our beers, then introduced our very cool cans, and have just put out our fourth flagship: Zona's Revenge Witbier. (Her can design is uhhhh-mazing.) Plus seasonals and small batches of specialty beers.  All along we have pushed ourselves to create new and exciting brews that folks like you will fall in love with. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500480216/laodppbiih0vojtwanx4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We must be doing something right, because we have found we simply cannot keep up with demand.  A pretty good problem to have, true, but folks are left wanting our beers for mountain top picnics, hikes, float trips and everything in between.  This is sad. Our fans are sad.  (And we don't want our fans to be sad.)</p>
<p>So, we need to grow. We need to expand our brew pad with a new 90 barrel fermenter so we can brew more beer so our fans won't be sad.  This happened a bit before our financial timeline allows, which is why we are asking you to help us.  We can hardly make enough beer to keep up with demand in West Virginia, let alone the few places we are in Virginia.  (There's an awful lot of trails, rivers and mountains in the two Virginia's, ya know?) And folks in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington DC, and Ohio want to take us everywhere too. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why help?</h3>
<p>Nestled in a small valley in one of the most gorgeous places on earth, and surrounded by mountains, trails and pristine rivers, GVBC is only one of  26 craft breweries in the state of West Virginia, and the only one in Greenbrier County.  (Full disclosure: there is a distillery and a meadery in the county. Our people like choices.)</p>
<p>We want to grow so that we can become a part of the economic renewal West Virginia so desperately needs.  We want to be that place where the high school Seniors work their last summer.  We want to be the place that those kids come back to as adults and show their friends what they did.  We want to show the world what West Virginia truly is and can be.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500482000/ln5k4bx3h53my53i8lrj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Greenbrier County specifically, and West Virginia in general, is in danger of losing its youth to more attractive states that offer better jobs and more opportunities to grow.   Wouldn't it be great if some of them stayed to work in a craft brewery in Greenbrier County?  How very cool would it be if some of them stayed and grew up with us ~ raising adorable kids, buying lovely mountain cabins, bringing their families to work ?  We are already a family business, we'd love to stay that way. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500483028/lnw6pbsvueb6cxd2sxuq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>But we have come to a tipping point.  Produce more and grow into a pretty nice employer for the county and the state, plus make more delicious brews for you and everyone else.  Or. Stay where we are in production, watch our fans go elsewhere because we can't keep up, and eventually have to let our employees go and close.  That would make us really sad.  (And we don't want to be sad.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How can you help?</h3>
<p>We need to raise a minimum of $ 27,000.</p>
<p>This will allow us to finance the initial investment to expand our fermenter size, stockpile some grain and hops and maybe get some more kegs.  The fermenter is essential to expansion.  Grain, hops and kegs are too.  Can't make beer without all of them. </p>
<p>You can donate, even a little bit.  Or you can share our campaign. On Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat or whatever your gig is.  You can email your friends, your mom &amp; dad or your co-workers our link.  Or talk about us. (In glowing terms like ""Awesome brewery!"")  Or you can play our ""Found Devil Anse"" game on social media.  You can ""Like"" us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or Untapp'd.  Or come visit us.  We love visitors. Drink more craft beer. (Hopefully ours, but we like all our family of WV Craft Brewers.)   Or you can send us good thoughts.  Those work too. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>All the good feels and then some.</h3>
<p>You're going to donate! Yes! Thank you!  What do you get for helping us out? </p>
<p>Of course there's the good feels you will get for helping us out.  And hugs!  We give good hugs at the brewery.  And ""Cheers!""  We give fantastic ""Cheers!"" at the brewery.  (Some would call us experts at it.) But there's also some very cool perks for donating to our cause. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500485341/klddyxlgjwfvt01in5dw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Every single person donating to our cause will get their name emblazoned on our <strong>""Wall of Fame"" </strong>in the tap room.  Plus a ""Cheers!"" on our Facebook page. </p>
<p><strong>Merch and Swag!</strong> We've got decals, koozies, pint glasses, growlers and tees. Oh my. Frisbees and camp cups and more.  Some very cool tap handles of Devil Anse, or Mothman or Sasquatch's foot (Wild Trail Pale Ale)</p>
<p>A few of you will get to be <strong>""Brewer for a day""</strong> and help brew a small batch with our team and name the brew.  And there's more!  We do live in a state where we can't give away beer, but we can offer some deep discounts.  Very deep.  You could become a card carrying member of our <strong>""We took GVBC everywhere!"" Club </strong>which will get you some nice discounts at the tap room.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>What happens if we don't raise it all?</h3>
<p>In the sad event we don’t raise it all, the money we do raise will be directed to the items of equipment we need. Your contribution will go towards providing us with the tools to produce more brew for more folks in the months and years to come. </p>
<p>Our promise to you is to do everything in our power, and some things that seem impossible, to raise the funds to grow this brewery into a sustainable, economically &amp; environmentally sound production brewery that your grandchildren will come to appreciate. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>You're a brewery.  Aren't you loaded? (Pun intended.)</h3>
<p>That's a really good question and we're glad you asked it. </p>
<p>Surely if we are making all this great beer, we must be making money left, right and center.  But we're not.  Having all the financial power to do the things we need to do would be a fantastic way to do business. The volume of beer we produce is really small compared to other breweries both in state and beyond.  (Seriously.  Tiny.) The actual profit we make doesn't allow us to invest in really big items like fermenters whenever we want.  Or need.  Most of our money  goes towards grain and hops and kegs and cans so we can consistently put out our awesome brews. </p>
<p>By helping us out you are making a direct impact on a small business in a small state.  We know, because our fans tell us, that we have some pretty special brews, and they need to go everywhere.   We need our fans to lend us a hand, show us you believe in us.</p>

What happens if we don't raise it all?
In the sad event we don’t raise it all, the money we do raise will be directed to the items of equipment we need. Your contribution will go towards providing us with the tools to produce more brew for more folks in the months and years to come. 
Our promise to you is to do everything in our power, and some things that seem impossible, to raise the funds to grow this brewery into a sustainable, economically & environmentally sound production brewery that your grandchildren will come to appreciate. 
 

You're a brewery.  Aren't you loaded? (Pun intended.)
That's a really good question and we're glad you asked it. 
Surely if we are making all this great beer, we must be making money left, right and center.  But we're not.  Having all the financial power to do the things we need to do would be a fantastic way to do business. The volume of beer we produce is really small compared to other breweries both in state and beyond.  (Seriously.  Tiny.) The actual profit we make doesn't allow us to invest in really big items like fermenters whenever we want.  Or need.  Most of our money  goes towards grain and hops and kegs and cans so we can consistently put out our awesome brews. 
By helping us out you are making a direct impact on a small business in a small state.  We know, because our fans tell us, that we have some pretty special brews, and they need to go everywhere.   We need our fans to lend us a hand, show us you believe in us.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>A Kitchen for Everyone </h3>
<p>We fell into a quick friendship over 4 years ago scheming about our local food scene.  Amy was fully entrenched in the local food movement and Susan was working with people to help them live a healthier life.  We first thought about opening a restaurant but soon realized that feeding people was only part of our vision.  We kept coming back to the idea that we wanted to create <strong>systemic change in our community</strong> and strengthen the ability for everyone, regardless of income, age, health conditions, etc., to be able to eat well.  We started talking to others and listening to <strong>what got in the way</strong> of healthy eating.  We heard themes: lack of time, energy and inspiration, cost, challenging health conditions, lack of knowledge or skills, and inadequate physical space.  We began dreaming of a place where folks could <strong>get the support they needed</strong> to figure out each of these obstacles.  A place to grab a meal, take a class, gather with friends, meet new friends, gain inspiration, support others and more. </p>
<p>It seemed like a lot to take on so we began with just one facet: <strong>locally-sourced frozen meals</strong>.  For 2 years, we’ve been making 80-100 hand pies or calzones, 20 casseroles and 20 soups every two weeks and delivering to sites in Jericho, Richmond, and Winooski.  We didn't know how people would respond and were amazed when we sold out week after week.  We realized we weren’t alone in our desire to have a quick, easy, healthy, and local meal readily available.  After two years of cooking in Amy's home kitchen, we are ready to expand production while  implementing our full business plan.</p>

<h3><strong>Supporting Local</strong></h3>
<p>Every meal we sell incorporates <strong>as many ingredients as possible</strong> from our local farmers and producers.  We buy most of our vegetables and proteins from Jericho Settlers Farm, Maple Wind Farm, The Farm at VYCC, Lewis Creek Farm, and Adam's Farm. We process huge amounts of vegetables during their <strong>peak growing season</strong> and store them for use during the winter and spring.  We buy beans from Vermont Bean Crafters, tortillas from All Souls Tortilleria, flour from King Arthur Flour, butter from Cabot, bread from Sweet Simone’s and sweeten all of our dough with maple syrup with Slopeside Syrup.  We believe <strong>that buying local helps create a strong local economy</strong>.  We also like knowing our farmers and their practices. </p>
<h3>Social Entrepreneurship</h3>
<p>We are excited to be a part of a growing type of company that uses <strong>business as a force for good</strong> and as a means to tackle important social issues.  Rather than structuring ourselves as a non-profit, we have <strong>integrated our social mission</strong> into the fabric of our company.  At the heart of this mission is our desire to support any member of our community as they navigate towards their best relationship with food.  We will be incorporating a spectrum of services over the next year–from classes and workshops to pre-made meals and inspirational gatherings–and also creating a ‘Feed it Forward’ program that allows those with an ability to pay more to support those who can’t. This model combined with our intentional approach of listening carefully to the needs and wishes of our community has the potential to create powerful change at a local level.</p>
<div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3></div>
<div><p>Moving from Amy's certified home kitchen into the Blue Seal Feeds building is a HUGE step. We've become well-versed in areas we never expected: zoning, permits, Fire Marshall inspections, watts vs. volts vs. amps, equipment purchases, interior renovations, and more. At the same time we still need to <strong>purchase a ton of local food</strong> during the peak growing season in Vermont.  We are looking for support from our community to be able to do it all.  In return, besides our undying love, we will be sharing with you some tokens of appreciation.  Everyone that donates will get a personal note of thanks as well as a favorite recipe of ours. Donate more and the list grows.  We can't do this without you, so thank you for supporting our dream!</p></div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know it's ambitious to launch so many aspects of our model at once when each one could be a business in its own right. As we have started our renovations we've also met <strong>unexpected challenges,</strong> including: upgrading an entire electrical system, replacing walls, repairing a ventilation hood system, and more.  There is a lot to figure out but we are confident that we can accomplish what needs to be done to make our dream a reality!  Your support will help us rise up and successfully overcome these challenges.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please support us in any way you can!  We understand that not everyone can contribute financially.  If you believe in our campaign, don't be shy about <strong>spreading the word</strong>.  Each of you has an idea, we are sure of it, and we’d love to hear them all.  Stop by, email, or give a call to let us know <strong>how we can best support you</strong>.  We want to make your food goals a reality, but to do that, we need YOU to help us make our dream a reality.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Please help us take advantage of a rare opportunity for expansion.</p>
<p>Firewheel Coffee is a local, independent coffee shop that has served the Garland, Texas, community for five years, earning rave reviews for our hand-made beverages and outstanding service. We have 4.8 stars on Facebook, 4.5 stars on Yelp, and 4.8 stars on Google Plus (all out of five stars) spanning hundreds of reviews.</p>
<p>Because of our reputation, we have been invited to partner with a developer who wants to build four food courts (called Urban 8) in high-density, high-traffic areas. We would be one of eight vendors in each food court, expanding our business from one to five locations in a time span of about two years.</p>
<p>This build-out schedule for the Urban 8 locations is extremely aggressive. Consequently, our available capital is currently insufficient to take advantage of this opportunity. Additionally, equipment failures (freezers, espresso machine, HVAC) at our Garland shop have set us back as well.</p>
<p>Instead of letting this opportunity pass us by, we're coming to you for help. We're hoping to raise $60,000 to help with build-out and equipment purchase for the new location, and equipment repair for our current location.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need $10,000 for equipment upgrade and repair for the current shop, and $50,000 for equipment and signage for the first new Urban 8 shop.</li>
<li>Incentives include coffee mugs (of course), and tote bags with exclusive artwork, and even free coffee for life at the highest contribution level. And everyone who contributes will have their names on our wall of appreciation at our first new Urban 8 location.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Being invited to participate in the Urban 8 food court expansion is a rare opportunity for an independent shop like ours. We are humbled to to have the invitation, and we intend to make the most of it and show the world that there's a viable alternative to corporate coffee. All we need is some additional capital. And, given the chance, we'd rather share the success that opportunity brings with those who believe in us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not in a position to contribute, we completely understand. But if you still want to help, we'd be grateful if you could get the word out by sharing this campaign on social media. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Evan and I am from the United States. After serving in the military I found a home here in Okinawa unlike anywhere I have ever been including my home. After getting married and making many local friends I realized that so many here had no idea what good cheese or bacon was. I set out on a journey to give my friends and Japanese family a taste of Heaven! I learned cheese-making at a local dairy farm under the guidance of man from England. Then I got to work experimenting with a variety of cured meats like pancetta, capocollo and smoked bacon. After making many new friends and having them try my food I have come to the realization that I must open a restaurant.</p>
<p> Opening a restaurant as been a dream of mine for a long time and now it seems to be possible. The only issue is our initial funding in order to receive assistance from the local business associations. We have found a location next to a small goat farm with a gutted store ready to be transformed into this dream. I have worked hard my whole life and dedicated myself to serving my country and my supporting my family. Starting this restaurant will not just be the fulfillment of a dream but an example of dedication and hard work to my children and others who know me and have supported me this far. </p>
<p>My plan is to make this restaurant a place that brings communities together to socialize and bridge the gaps between the local people and the foreigners living here, and I can think of no better way then to sit down together and eat cheese and meat. By helping us you will be assisting us on achieving this goal of sharing and fusion of cultures. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics are right around the corner and I believe this restaurant would be a great place to gather to watch the games!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to get started we need roughly $20,000. This will serve to show the bank that we have enough finances on-hand to support them approving a business loan. Once the loan is approved these finances will go towards supporting my family for the first year so I do not need to take a salary.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Some of the perks we will be offering will be dining vouchers, T-shirts, bacon and cheese making classes to hosting parties for small groups!</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>If we cannot reach our goal the funds will still serve the same purpose however I will have to take a small salary from the restaurant's earnings. </span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Another positive impact this restaurant will have will be on providing families of US service members a place to come and feel at home. I will have a traditional American breakfast available every Saturday and Sunday starting at 7 AM. I will have other options like an Irish or English breakfast as well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This risks with this endeavor are high. I am planning on quitting my current job to be a full-time restaurant owner and cook.

There is also the chance that we might not get loan approval.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>To solve these challenges we plan on using the existing business network we have made with friends and colleges to spread the word, as well use the customers we already have who order bacon from us every month. we believe these options plus the utilization of social media will allow us to succeed.

<h3>Bourbon and the Biblical Lands: A Love Story</h3>
<p>Bourbon and the State of Israel have been two of the great loves in our lives.  Their presence for us is constant, and we're thrilled at the opportunity to combine those passions into our new product, 'Slingshot', an American-style whiskey. We feel at peace looking at the lush, green Ella Valley, the place where David slew the giant Goliath with nothing more than a slingshot.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The global demand for whiskeys continues to grow rapidly, making the whiskey market extremely exciting for contributors. The booming global demand has been accompanied by a proliferation of boutique distilleries.</p>
<p>Indeed, global whiskey manufacturers have been scrambling to keep up with the increased taste for liquor around the world.</p>
<p>Bourbon, the distinctly American corn-based whiskey, is also on the rise, in what Fortune Magazine is calling <i>“The billion-dollar bourbon boom”</i>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Trailblazing biblically inspired bourbon in the Holy Land</strong></h3>
<p>Based on the success of bourbon around the world, we want to create <strong>Israel’s first American-style Whiskey distillery</strong>. We hope to trailblaze the Israeli whiskey palate and bring an added level of sophistication to the country's cocktail culture just starting to take off.</p>
<p>It will be crafted using only the finest local crops and ingredients including natural spring water from the Ella Valley.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your contributions will be allocated principally toward the acquisition of additional copper stills and fermenting tanks, to aid us in not only increasing production of our flagship product, but to allow us more flexibility in experimenting with additional products in the near future. Approximately 70% of the funds will go toward this effort, while about 30% will be utilized to secure the appropriate cooperage (barrels) we require.</p>
<p>With your help, we expect to begin regular production towards the summer of 2018, and, of course, to begin aging our first batches shortly thereafter, which would allow us to <u>begin bottling by fall 2019</u>. While our initial batches will be produced with grain purchased from various local suppliers, we expect to harvest our own corn in the spring and summer that will follow.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Contribute $25 and receive a special “Indiegogo Edition”, 100ml <strong>bottle</strong> of 'Slingshot' American-style whiskey</li>
<li>Contribute $36 for a set of 4 wooden <strong>coasters</strong> sporting the' Legends Distillery' logo</li>

<h3>About the location</h3>
<p>Unlike the pre-existing distilleries, Legends Distillery hopes to augment Israel’s tourism industry by offering a product drawn from domestically harvested grains, and inspired by local biblical legend.</p>
<p>Located in the Judean Hills, about 25 miles southwest of Jerusalem, Ella Valley is the site of the Biblical story of David and Goliath, as told in the Book of Samuel. In that battle, David the shepherd boy, years before he became the mighty King David, killed the giant Philistine Goliath with a single stone – from his <i>Slingshot</i>.</p>
<p>The Ella Valley is also filled with vineyards. Ella Valley is home to 20% of Israel’s vineyards.</p>
<p>It is thus our hope that tour groups of all denominations and affiliations will “top off” their visit to the valley with a Legends Distillery tour.</p>
<p>We intend to simultaneously market to Israeli and American customers, while offering our facility and tasting room for corporate and social events, and connecting the distillery and product to the Bible and the land of Israel.</p>
<p>It is our hope and expectation that tourists the world over will visit and enjoy, bring a bottle or two back to their countries of origin, and become brand ambassadors for Legends Distillery.</p>
</div></div>","Bourbon and the Biblical Lands: A Love Story
Bourbon and the State of Israel have been two of the great loves in our lives.  Their presence for us is constant, and we're thrilled at the opportunity to combine those passions into our new product, 'Slingshot', an American-style whiskey. We feel at peace looking at the lush, green Ella Valley, the place where David slew the giant Goliath with nothing more than a slingshot.
 
Introduction
The global demand for whiskeys continues to grow rapidly, making the whiskey market extremely exciting for contributors. The booming global demand has been accompanied by a proliferation of boutique distilleries.
Indeed, global whiskey manufacturers have been scrambling to keep up with the increased taste for liquor around the world.
Bourbon, the distinctly American corn-based whiskey, is also on the rise, in what Fortune Magazine is calling “The billion-dollar bourbon boom”.
 
Trailblazing biblically inspired bourbon in the Holy Land
Based on the success of bourbon around the world, we want to create Israel’s first American-style Whiskey distillery. We hope to trailblaze the Israeli whiskey palate and bring an added level of sophistication to the country's cocktail culture just starting to take off.
It will be crafted using only the finest local crops and ingredients including natural spring water from the Ella Valley.
 

What We Need & What You Get
Your contributions will be allocated principally toward the acquisition of additional copper stills and fermenting tanks, to aid us in not only increasing production of our flagship product, but to allow us more flexibility in experimenting with additional products in the near future. Approximately 70% of the funds will go toward this effort, while about 30% will be utilized to secure the appropriate cooperage (barrels) we require.
With your help, we expect to begin regular production towards the summer of 2018, and, of course, to begin aging our first batches shortly thereafter, which would allow us to begin bottling by fall 2019. While our initial batches will be produced with grain purchased from various local suppliers, we expect to harvest our own corn in the spring and summer that will follow.
 
Perks

Contribute $25 and receive a special “Indiegogo Edition”, 100ml bottle of 'Slingshot' American-style whiskey
Contribute $36 for a set of 4 wooden coasters sporting the' Legends Distillery' logo
Contribute $50 for 1-year membership status including 10% off any purchases of 'Slingshot' or merchandise from the gift shop
Contribute $100 and receive a baseball cap, embroidered with the Legends Distillery logo
Contribute $200 and receive a high-quality polo shirt, embroidered with the Legends Distillery logo
Contribute $500 and receive your own personalized, numbered, Premium Reserve Series bottle of 'Slingshot'

Contribute $15,000 and receive a large customized barrel, containing over 200 bottles worth of our premier spirit, emblazoned with your name.

Please note that other denominations of funds can also be pledged.

<h3>Krishna Cow Sanctuary</h3>
<p>We are a cow sanctuary on the Big Island of Hawaii that evolved from a small backyard dairy, based on the teaching of Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhhupada. We are attempting to change the dairy industry by providing an alternative example; a model that requires no killing, where calves can drink from their mothers, and the males and retired mothers are allowed to live out their lives in peace!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you can imagine, this is a huge committment and basically an endless service. To fund this endeavor, we sell our excess cruelty-free dairy products. However, we are limited to what we can sell online (too expensive and risky to ship most milk products). That is why we are very interested in getting a state-of-the-art freeze dryer from a reputable brand, Harvest Right. This will allow us to freeze dry our dairy products, and especially our whey, enabling worldwide distribution. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED!</strong></p>
</div><div>The freeze dryer we wish to purchase is from Harvest Right and is currently selling for just under $3000 (plus more for shipping)! This will allow us to freeze-dry nearly 1500 gallons of milk a year.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Chris Gugel, and I'm the owner and founder of Maestro Winery. I live in Jacksonville, Fl where I have spent time teaching in the arts and making wine!</p>
<p>Since moving to Jacksonville, I've been astonished at the growth of the craft brewing and distilling scenes, however, the wine scene is another story. There are currently no wineries in Jacksonville. With a population pushing 1 million people, the city of Jacksonville is long overdue for a winery that can join the craft and boutique alcohol production arena in Northeast Florida. </p>
<p>Maestro Winery differs from a traditional winery in two ways: Maestro Winery is an urban winery concept, and it will incorporate a strong arts presence to provide a complete wine experience to guests.</p>
<p>The urban winery concept is a great way to fully integrate Maestro Winery into the heart of Jacksonville. Jacksonville prides itself on revitalizing many different and unique neighborhoods and districts within the city. Citizens enjoy visiting these unique areas for food, entertainment, recreation, and shopping. Maestro Winery will be nestled in the Riverside and Five Points area, located on the west bank of the St. John's River.</p>
<p>The arts and entertainment scene in Jacksonville is already established and well cultivated by the community. Maestro Winery will compliment and add to the arts scene by offering live entertainment and instruction in the arts. All of this will combine to create a complete and memorable wine experience for guests.</p>
<p>Wines produced at Maestro Winery will range from traditional varieties (such as Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon) to muscadine and country wines. The muscadine wines will use Florida grown muscadine grapes, while the country wines will incorporate unique ingredients such as blueberries, strawberries, honey, citrus, and even rose petals! Many of these wines have already won medal recognition at prominent wine making competitions, including gold medals for muscadine wine, chocolate orange wine, and rose petal wine. Even though the winery will offer a wide variety of wines, we will focus on small batches of each variety in order to create a truly craft and boutique product that offers more than a traditional wine experience to our guests.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are aiming to collect $30,000 or more.  The equipment required to produce high quality wines is very costly. The money raised during this campaign will be used to obtain only the best equipment to ensure the highest quality wine production.  Any additional monies generated will be used for necessary renovations and to keep our leases paid during this interim period where we wont be able to produce wine or generate revenue.  </p>
<p>What do contributor's get for showing their support?  We've set up a number of options to choose from to suit any taste or budget.</p>
<p>Our lower cost options include wine enjoying essentials such as wine glasses and corkscrew, all brandishing the Maestro Winery logo. Higher support options throw in free wine club membership and prizes, both of which include selecting one of our premium wines to enjoy. The premium perk allows contributors to be forever memorialized by sponsoring a select variety of wine, which includes your name on that particular vintage of wine!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>To make Maestro Winery a reality we will need help.  We want to build a winery that our community and you as a contributor can be proud of.  The winery will be engrained into the community and the arts for all to enjoy. We will compliment and enhance the already thriving arts scene and community pride.</p>
<p>Your generosity as a contributor cannot be thanked enough.  Simply put, without you none of this will be possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The process of starting a winery can be a lengthy one. Once the space is acquired and the equipment installed, it will take a few months before the first wines will be ready to bottle. Even with this wait time, we will waste no time in reaching out to the community. Arts instruction will be able to start prior to wine being finished, so we can get a jumpstart on our goals.</p>
<p>With such a long todo list ahead of us, I have sought the help and assistance of many qualified individuals. I've been working extensively with individuals who are familiar with the startup process and have implemented multiple startups in the past. I've also been working closely with Florida vineyards and wineries to become better acquainted with the rules, regulations, and trends in the wine industry, especially as it relates to Florida. Florida currently does not boast many commercial wineries, so the industry is willing to assist and anxious to see a growth in Florida wineries!</p>
