<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Saleyards Hotel, Rockhampton, Queensland</h3>
<p>Thanks for stopping by!  We're so excited about our new adventure in Rockhampton and hope you can come along for the ride!</p>
<p>We've bought an iconic old pub, motel and restaurant in Rockhampton with the dream of bringing a small batch distillery to the region and create a great brand with distillers who are passionate about great quality spirits with innovative flavours, sourced locally.  </p>
<p>Our aim is bring the place back to life, provide a bar that's got something a little bit different, an inviting place for all, whether you be a local, a spirit aficionado, a tourist passing by, youngins looking for a night out or a family looking for a great place to eat. </p>
<p>We're working with the local community to also provide a place where local musicians and artists can show their work and, when we've grown enough, we'll be providing jobs for the local economy, and top quality booze to everyone all over Australia and the world.</p>
<p>The building is a bit of a mess and we've got a lot of work to do.  To fund this exercise, we've decided to offer you the chance to be one of the first to taste our spirits at a bargain price, or perhaps you'd like to take on a more quirky sponsorship in the form of you or your company naming parts of the building; a must for those who want to have their name attached to something really special.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're looking to fund the renovation to get us ready to go into production.  We're looking for at least $50,000 to get this done.</p>
<p>The rewards for sponsorship are below and will be delivered at various stages of the project.</p>
<p>When looking at the rewards involving the Rum, Whisky and Gin, think of it like pre-purchasing the first available batch of a great new product at a discount.  You'll love them as much as we do, we promise!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact your sponsorship will bring will be massive to our little project and we will be forever grateful for your help!</p>

</div></div>","OUR STORY
Across cultures. Across disciplines. Engaging thoughtful discussions within the community of artists, neighbors, anyone witnessing.  Inspiring collaborations. Listening. Creating consciousness surrounding the beauty & insights from the creative process... 
Facilitated by award-winning performance artist Baraka de Soleil & co-facilitated by multidisciplinary artist Awilda Rodriguez Lora Re-Frame: A Gathering is a two-fold communal workshop  for artists at variant stages of creative development. We want to provide a sustainable space for active witnessing, supportive feedback  and rigorous crafting AND a laboratory for experimentation through interdisciplined explorations and cross-cultural discussions. Re-Frame: A Gathering focuses on the 'practice of process' - what is discovered in the act of making work is valuable and should be experienced as well, by other artists, by the larger community.Baraka de Soleil and Awilda Rodriguez Lora initially met in Chicago. He was curating a unique multidisciplinary series “Studies n Black” for Links Hall and she produced an award-winning film STILL BLACK: a portrait of black transmen that premiered in Chicago.  Since meeting, they have worked together on numerous creative endeavors including S’Kin Deep and most recently co-facilitated  Agua/Tierra: A Listening Project in Panama in 2010.

Re-Frame: A Gathering is an initiative of D UNDERBELLY, a network of artists of color, seeking to create a  communal space for rigorous experimentation and investigation of an expansive performance aesthetic.  One that can serve as a model for creative process within community that can adapt and shift to various areas throughout the country &  internationally.   Through both invitation to select artists within the experimental art community and an open call, we will seek out a diverse group of 7 -10 with wide-range of disciplines who have a creative lineage (how they have been making work), a piece to 'excavate' and a desire to be part of a contemporary practice. Re-Frame: A Gathering will start with the artistic community of Chicago.Our current vision:

The workshop process will begin in November with weekly Re-Frame sessions where Baraka will lead artists participants through a series of techniques in order to cultivate: communal consciousness around witnessing & offering feedback, excavation of themes/pieces brought by each individual artist and potential collaborative groupings. This leads to the beginning of December where Awilda will join the process as co-facilitator, to take artists through an intensive journey towards deepening the practice of the developing works.  Mid-December at A Gathering with the larger community, artist participants will share their developing work, engage in conversations and share food for thought and body!

Re-Frame: A Gathering' Key Objectives
To provide:
- a reduced cost or free opportunity for artist participants.
- a platform for creative process that can be molded to whatever communities it travels to....
- a unique opportunity for experimentation, to 'dig deep' & try things out with developing work or already-created work that may need ‘re-framing’.

To support:
- artists at whatever stage in their career.
- exchange and community building
- sustainability for the active creative process

To enhance:
- a multidisciplinary network of artists within the Chicago experimental aesthetic community and beyond.
- an expansive & diversified cross-pollination of collaborative possibilities.

- visibility for process-driven models with thoughtful intercultural community engagement.


Funds from this campaign will support the vision  in multiple ways beyond the costs associated with creating work.  We deeply believe that with your support, Re-Frame: A Gathering will impact not only the artist participants, facilitators and community of witnesses, but the larger discussion on the value of the creative process.
THE IMPACT
For Re-Frame: A Gathering, we are seeking to raise funds to support space rental costs, materials for the workshop process, honorarium for the artist participants and facilitators involved. 

More specifically if we reach:


$1500, this amount will cover rental & production costs associated with the space; both for workshop process & performance showings


$2000, in addition to covering rental, will support any materials for the workshop process, 'bare-bones' production elements for the showing & travel for one artist facilitator 


$3000, in addition to the above, secures a no cost opportunity for all artist participants  and provide honorarium for both artist facilitators & 

$4000, in addition the above funds, will provide  honorarium for each of the artist participant



In alignment with this campaign, we are working to ensure Re-Frame: A Gathering happens, even with the smallest of funds including:



soliciting in-kind contributions from organizations to reduce the cost for rental of space.


box office contributions from A Gathering's three showings.


barter/trade of services in order to promote/market the event.


based on amount raised, seek financial investments from artists who wish to participate in the process.

re-configuring the model so that it will reduce costs but still honor the artists & the process.
cooking meals that can be purchased at the showings.





THE EXCHANGE


We want to you to know that we value whichever amount you pledge.  In exchange for your support, Baraka de Soleil, Awilda Rodriguez Lora, artists participants &  D UNDERBELLY will acknowledge you through the program, online, via phone, with hand-made art, original designs, through complimentary tickets, invitations to A Gathering and future projects. You'll notice on our perks list what kind of acknowledgement each tier of funding support will garner.

</h3>My name is Drew Mason and I created Mason Surf Designs to build top quality handcrafted surfboards heavily influenced by 1950s, 60s, and 70s style designs. In today's market, the three main U.S. manufacturers in the surfing industry produce computer generated, cookie-cutter boards that seriously limit a consumers customization options. Surfing and board building heritage has always been based upon the Shaper + Surfer relationship; building a board by hand for the individual, not producing a generic board for the masses. I've been shaping boards for 10 years, and surfing for 20. From the first time I rode a board at the age of 9, surfing and the surfing community have played a major role in my life.  My goal is to share that experience through my designs and make boards that continue and strengthen the tradition of Shaper + Surfer + Community.  And since surfing is a lifestyle in addition to being a sport, I want Mason Surf Designs to be a lifestyle brand and offer all the necessary clothing, accessories, and home goods for the surfing consumer to live a happy and full life.  With your help and support, I can achieve that goal.<br/>MasonSurfDesigns.com<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1026707/files/20141118121431-P1010568.JPG?1416341671"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; How It Helps<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>Since starting Mason Surf Designs in 2012, I’ve struggled to design, shape, finish and sell my boards without the benefit of a consistent and dedicated workplace. For those unfamiliar with the process of making a surfboard, it begins by ordering a blank (unshaped surfboard block of foam), shaping the blank into the final surfboard shape based off of various templates, fiberglassing the board (to waterproof the foam and give strength), and then marketing and locating a customer. The total time it takes for a board to be made is about 6­-8 weeks. Without a shop or space of my own, I'm currently using four different locations to get the board from rough to finished.  The risk of the board getting damaged in transit is fairly high and, once finished, I don't have an easy way to market it and attract customers.<br/><br/><h3>Why I need your help<br/>
</h3>
<p>My biggest business challenge is not having a shop. I need a space with a shaping bay in the back to make boards and a small store­front for products. Your contribution will give Mason Surf Designs a face; a physical address where anyone can come and be a part of the craftsmanship and community that are unique to surfing. The $50,000 goal of my campaign will allow me to find and lease space for a shop, establish a shaping bay and storefront, and stock it with my hand-crafted boards, as well as surf-related clothing and accessories.<br/><br/></p>

<h3>Stretch Goal #1 - $70,000</h3>
<p>The second most important asset after acquiring a shop is purchasing a shop van. Getting blanks, moving boards, and shipping product will be easier and more efficient with a Mason Surf Designs cargo van.</p>

<p>Finally, surfing isn't all about being in the ocean, it's a lifestyle. Sandals, boots, candles, wallets, shaving goods, denim... all contribute to this lifestyle.

</div> <p><br/></p></div>","We’re exiting this era of culture where fitness should be serious. 
This is the equivalent of grown-up recess.


The Athletic Playground was started in 2008 by Shira Yaziv and David Grace as a way to offer playful and fun fitness opportunities to the San Francisco Bay Area. Since then, AP has grown exponentially, incorporating classes in acrobatics, dance, parkour, aerials, acroyoga, hula hooping, monkey conditioning, and more! In addition to offering a playful, fun, and skill-oriented route to fitness, the Athletic Playground has become a community hub, hosting social events and building lasting friendships.
Now we want to bring all of this to Seattle!
In 2013, Jen Ryan, a former teacher and student at AP, moved to Seattle and found her new life had a large, gaping, Athletic Playground-sized hole in it. Teaming up with Shira and long-time AP instructors Zach Fischer and Marria Kee, the decision was made to open Athletic Playground Seattle.

Here is where you come in. Starting a business takes a lot of money. We are not wealthy entrepreneurs, but we are skilled teachers, experienced business people, and passionate movement enthusiasts. We want to provide a space for movers of all kinds to come together, learn new things, make new friends, grow, and thrive. But we need your help to make this happen.
   Here is what we need to make this real Our stretch goal is to raise $60,000 to make this epic.
But we can get started with $20k. 
Here is what we need:

Space to move in! We need a lot of floorspace and a bit of height. We'll need to give our landlord a deposit and show them that we can pay a few months rent up front.
 Improvements to that space! Because of our physical requirements, we're looking at industrial spaces. It might be pretty raw when we move in. We expect we'll need to put in some flooring, install and rig some equipment, paint a bit, maybe build some walls, improve the bathrooms... anything that needs to be done to the space itself to make it a place you want to come and play in. 
Toys! We will need mats, crash pads, tumbling blocks, ropes, monkey bars... Some of these things are very cheap (rubber balls!), but some of them are not at all (crash pads...) and all together it adds up very quickly. The more we can raise, the more toys you all get to play with!

Amazing teachers! We'd love to believe that our doors will be beaten down on Day One by all of Seattle's excited monkeys! But let's be real; it takes time for a business to grow. We know the first few months will be tight, and we want to be ready for it. Our biggest operational expense will be our teachers' pay. They are the reason you will want to keep coming back here. They make us who we are and they are Worth. Every. Penny. Help us keep them teaching during our first few months of growth. 





We feel the best way to reward you for contributing to our campaign is to get you to come and play with us, so we're offering access perks- free classes, memberships, private lessons. If you would like to support us from afar and you feel it is unlikely you will make it to Seattle to use your perk, please consider ""paying it forward."" For every contributor who chooses to Pay It Forward, the value of your perk with be added to our scholarship fund to provide access to low-income individuals and families.
**If you want to pay your perk forward, please send us a message to let us know. Thank you!

About Us


Citizen Sting was started by Richard FitzGerald, a self-confessed news junky and travel addict who was also formerly a business development executive and consultant working with web based start-ups. The campaign seeks funds to supplement the founder's original investment.


What We Need & What You Get

 Citizen Sting is hoping to achieve the following:



Raise $15,000. This will be used to complete the content delivery platform, build a organizational infrastructure, compensate editors and content contributors and cover things like hosting and ongoing development costs.

In future, where appropriate the platform will promote products and services that fit with our objectives and we hope to offer some exclusive discounts. 
Citizen Sting also wants to support community organizations working towards complementary objectives. Ideally, the community will have a voice in these decisions.
In the event that Citizen Sting does not meet its fundraising goal, the work will continue using the founder's investment and/or funds from other sources. 

The Impact
 The motivation behind Citizen Sting is simple:  Discussion builds understanding. Understanding builds tolerance. Tolerance makes for a better world.
So why not use the technologies and techniques of the Internet and social media to raise the bar on what media we consume and share?     Risks & Challenges  The risks for Citizen Sting are common to any start-up. The content will be free for people to read and the platform will be advertiser supported so the organization will eventually need to generate revenue in excess of its ongoing costs.  The founder has experience working with start-ups to take them from loss making to profitable. The near-term plan is to create a lean organization relying on passionate individual contributors, partner companies and freelancers.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Jacob Ner-David and Yehuda Nahar met in 2009 along with their families and others, to revive Kibbutz
Hanaton, a destination familiar to many North Americans as a favorite locale for summer youth programs to Israel. </span><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Motivated by the desire to reconnect with the
land and to live with like-minded friends in harmony as a community, Jacob and Yehuda joined the Kibbutz and in 2011 founded Jezreel Valley Winery, a professional extension of the dream. </span><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Soon after, they
recruited Ari Erle as consulting winemaker, and Shlomo Shmilovitz (Momo) as partner, and the team set out to make high-quality
wine with a Jezreel twist.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">From the selection of varietals to
the branding of the winery, Jacob and Yehuda were guided by their love of wine
and people -- they wanted to develop wine that would win prizes, but most important they wanted to be a winery that was accessible and enjoyable to their friends and family.</span></p>

We are Israel's first start-up boutique winery.Achieving in only three years what most wineries take 10 years to, Jezreel Valley Winery creates wines that are distinctly Israeli, but also reflect our modern approach to winemaking using a unique
synthesis of varietals (including Israel's own Argaman grape) and best practices from Napa to Bordeaux. This indiegogo campaign is a funding round for a physical extension of our facility and operations in Israel.  We want you, our extended community of friends, family, wine and Israel lovers, to become our partners in the next chapter of our story; the next stage of our dream. Many of you we've already met over the last three years have told us how much you would love to get involved at the ground level with Israeli winemaking. You love wine, you told us. You love Israel. So do we. This is a way in. Join us as we launch this next stage of what we call ""Wine for Life."" WHAT IS WINE FOR LIFE?At Jezreel, we have a concept we call ""Wine for Life,"" which has two meanings -- one, to celebrate life with wine, and two, to literally create a connection with community members where we commit to providing wine for the rest of their lives. Every year as a PARTNER you will receive wine from us, with no additional cost (how much wine depends on level of partnership). Wine for Life is about celebrating our successes together with our PARTNERS and the wonder and holy magic of creating and enjoying wine from Israel.THE JEZREEL VALLEY WINERY STORY 
Jacob Ner-David and Yehuda Nahar met in 2009 along with their families and others, to revive Kibbutz
Hanaton, a destination familiar to many North Americans as a favorite locale for summer youth programs to Israel. Motivated by the desire to reconnect with the
land and to live with like-minded friends in harmony as a community, Jacob and Yehuda joined the Kibbutz and in 2011 founded Jezreel Valley Winery, a professional extension of the dream. Soon after, they
recruited Ari Erle as consulting winemaker, and Shlomo Shmilovitz (Momo) as partner, and the team set out to make high-quality
wine with a Jezreel twist.
From the selection of varietals to
the branding of the winery, Jacob and Yehuda were guided by their love of wine
and people -- they wanted to develop wine that would win prizes, but most important they wanted to be a winery that was accessible and enjoyable to their friends and family.



PARTNER'S WINEAs a PARTNER you will enjoy special access to wines that we will not produce at commercial levels, and will not be found in stores or restaurants. These wines will be set aside for you, our PARTNERS, our extended family.From year to year, harvest to harvest, our selections will change, depending on multiplicity of factors, ranging from grape quality, yield, and tastings along the way.The best way to enjoy PARTNER wine is here at our winery on Kibbutz Hanaton. PARTNERS receive exclusive access to our tours, winemaking events, and tastings. Next best is together with other wine lovers in your own local communities. We guarantee you that your friends will eagerly await their annual invitation to taste what wine reached your doorstep that year!In addition to the wine, we invite you to be a part of the process, from pruning to picking to bottling. All along the journey you will receive updates (including videos) from the team here at Jezreel Valley Winery -- so that when the wine finally reaches you it will be the culmination of a process you followed and participated in. In addition, you will be invited to our annual Wine for Life events in New York and in Israel for barrel tastings, where you will be able to taste samples from our future barrels, rate the wine, and vote for the next Jezreel Valley Partner's wine selection.You will truly help us to choose our Future Wine.
HOW DO WE DO WINE?Our goal is to make wine that is high quality, but reasonably
priced, so it may be enjoyable by both the casual wine drinker and the master
sommelier. Not an easy feat, but we're already doing it!Recently acknowledged by the Terravino Wine competition with a silver medal (RedBlend 2012), the Jezreel Valley Winery wines have already been featured in leading restaurants in Israel with the most discerning wine lists, as well as served to visiting delegations from all over the world.In three short years, we created an award-winning winery producing tens of thousands of bottles of wine. We took wines that had never been combined before and created our unique RedBlend, bringing to the forefront Israeli varietal Argaman (an Israeli-born grape invented at the Weizmann Institute), and reviving Carignan, a classic grape in Israeli wines brought to new levels. Our Chardonnay is a known varietal, but with a Jezreel twist -- winning over both master sommeliers and people who never before truly enjoyed a glass of wine. We renovated an abandoned kibbutz building (at one time, a repair garage for fixing tractors!) into a state-of-the-art winery, including wine press, fermentation tanks, barrels new and old, temperature controlled barrel room, bottle storage, and a visitor center that already has welcomed groups such as the National GA and Winter Family mission of the Jewish Federation of North America, delegations from Europe and Asia, and much more. It's been a most surprising and rewarding beginning.Now, you can be our PARTNER as we take our next step and as we continue to grow our community. You, too, can enjoy Wine for Life.

These tubs are specially build so that dogs only have to walk up a couple of steps to enter the tubs. We are going to build demi-walls between the tubs for privacy and reduced stress. And of course I want to create a welcoming and fun place to hang out. </p>
<p>These are the kind of tubs I will install:</p>

I have volunteered at the Seattle Zoo and am now washing dogs at the Whatcom Humane Society Shelter. My dog Fitz and I enjoy K9 Nosework together, through which we met many wonderful dog people in Bellingham.
I have been carefully planning, researching, and learning everything I can about the industry, coat and skin care, and the best products. I am ready to go and I am asking your help with closing a funding gap for the build-out of the store!  Starting a Brick and Mortar Store is Expensive

I am building  this business from the ground up and I am excited to help grow the community. But at this point I need your support! To help with the start-up costs, I need $3,000 — namely for the plumbing and installation of the dog tubs. These tubs are specially build so that dogs only have to walk up a couple of steps to enter the tubs. We are going to build demi-walls between the tubs for privacy and reduced stress. And of course I want to create a welcoming and fun place to hang out. 
These are the kind of tubs I will install:
The dog washes will come with a variety of shampoos and conditioners depending on the coat and skin conditions of your dog. We'll provide towels, brushes, nail clippers and strong pet dryers. There will be two grooming tables with electrical clippers, shears, brushes, and combs for self-service grooming. If you would like to learn more about grooming, we will have group classes about grooming and fun things like pet photography and doggie Halloween costumes.
And every dog deserves a treat after the bath! Shake & Shine will have a great selection of delicious and healthy treats - cookies, packaged, and bulk.
Other things you will be able to find at the store are shampoos and grooming equipment, collars and leashes, non-toxic flea treatments and more.To make this all possible we are turning to our supporters and future customers! I have several great perks available to you — get a taste of Shake & Shine before we even open!The Perks
I have a selection of perks to show my gratitude for contributions at all levels. Whether you can give $5 or more, I can't wait to see you at Shake & Shine! All perks are outlined below. They will be available to pick up in the shop or we will ship to you if you are outside of the Bellingham area. Perks like the t-shirt or the hook and towel will be ready before the shop opens. In any case, I am planning to send out postcards as confirmation for your contribution. Shake & Shine Washes

If you want a regular wash or all bells and whistles, get one or more washes at a special campaign price! Be the first through the door to try the new tubs, good shampoos and conditioners, fluffy towels, and professional pet dryers. Cookies!It is hard to resist cookies - it doesn't matter if you are a dog or human. Linda's cookies are not quiet ready to go, but I am adding cookies from MaSnax to the perks. Shake & Shine T-ShirtsI hope you agree: the shaking dog logo makes really cute T-shirts! There are two colors to choose from and two cuts. One is a straight cut, the other a women's cut. Please specify color, cut, and size.        Wipe Your PawsDo you have a dog station at your door? This perk includes the perfect hook and a nice cotton towel (hand-towel size), so you are always ready to wipe off muddy paws when you come home.                  Mix ItThe perks are a mix and match of washes, cookies, t-shirts, and dog stations - hopefully there is something there that will interest you!



Thank You!   

 

Thank you simply for your interest and reading this far, and thank you, thank you, thank you if you were able to contribute!

<h3><b>                            SNORO, c'est quoi ?</b></h3>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Séduit par le design, l'architecture et la récupération, j'ai récemment décidé de créer une
compagnie qui vise à redonner une nouvelle vie à une foule de bidules
défraîchis. Je désirais fabriquer mes propres oeuvres en transformant et en
recyclant les objets du quotidien, et créer des pièces singulières,
excentriques, des pièces qui reflètent ma vision de la vie. C'est un peu mon

<h3><b>                              What is SNORO?</b></h3>
<p>Strongly
attracted to design, architecture and recycling, I recently decided to create a
company dedicated to repurposing a multitude of previously-used contraptions. In
a way, it’s like giving a hand to dear old Mother Earth. I wanted to create my
own works of art by transforming and recycling day-to-day objects, and to
produce unique and eccentric pieces that reflect my vision of life.</p>

<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>                              Pourquoi SNORO ?</b></h3>
<p><b>Un jour, l'idée m'est venue de créer mon propre « métier
amusant » en alliant toutes les choses que j'aimais faire : rénover,
créer, recycler, bizouner, bricoler, et surtout, célébrer la différence en
suscitant un certain questionnement, en touchant les gens et en les faisant
sourire.<br/></b></p><p>
</p><p><b>La compagnie Snoro est née de ce désir. Espiègle, délurée,
astucieuse, elle est encore toute jeune, mais a déjà des idées plein la tête...

<b><div><b><br/></b></div></b><h3><b>                                 Why SNORO ?</b></h3><p><b>
</b></p><p>One day, I had the idea of creating my own
“enjoyable trade” by mixing all the things I enjoy doing – renovating,
creating, tinkering, puttering about, and celebrating uniqueness. I wanted to
make my own works of art by transforming mundane objects and creating singular,
eccentric pieces that reflect my vision of life, because I believe that
difference creates a sympathetic challenge, a sort of questioning, but mostly
that it touches people and makes them smile.</p>
<p>The Snoro Company was born of this
desire. Playful, bold, and clever, it is still very young, but its head is
overflowing with ideas...

<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>La
plupart des matériaux que j'utilise pour SNORO proviennent de
matières recyclées et d'objets parfois désuets récupérés à même la poubelle
(les résidus de vieille peau de banane et de café ont été soigneusement
éliminés). </b></p>
<p><b>Tous les objets peuvent être transformés, il suffit d'y mettre un peu de
temps, de plaisir et d'imagination... </b><b>                                                   </b></p>

<h3><b>                What
materials does SNORO use?</b></h3>
<p>Most materials used by SNORO come from
recycles items, repurposing obsolete objects some of which have sometimes been
pulled out of dumpsters – old banana peels and coffee grounds carefully
removed. </p>
<p>Any object can be transformed, it just
required a bit of time, playfulness and imagination.</p>

<p>Your donations will help promote recycling, differentiation and

Séduit par le design, l'architecture et la récupération, j'ai récemment décidé de créer une
compagnie qui vise à redonner une nouvelle vie à une foule de bidules
défraîchis. Je désirais fabriquer mes propres oeuvres en transformant et en
recyclant les objets du quotidien, et créer des pièces singulières,
excentriques, des pièces qui reflètent ma vision de la vie. C'est un peu mon
coup de main pour notre chère planète Terre. 

                

                              What is SNORO?
Strongly
attracted to design, architecture and recycling, I recently decided to create a
company dedicated to repurposing a multitude of previously-used contraptions. In
a way, it’s like giving a hand to dear old Mother Earth. I wanted to create my
own works of art by transforming and recycling day-to-day objects, and to
produce unique and eccentric pieces that reflect my vision of life.
     

                              Pourquoi SNORO ?
Un jour, l'idée m'est venue de créer mon propre « métier
amusant » en alliant toutes les choses que j'aimais faire : rénover,
créer, recycler, bizouner, bricoler, et surtout, célébrer la différence en
suscitant un certain questionnement, en touchant les gens et en les faisant
sourire.
La compagnie Snoro est née de ce désir. Espiègle, délurée,
astucieuse, elle est encore toute jeune, mais a déjà des idées plein la tête...
Suivez-moi dans cette folle aventure!
                                 Why SNORO ?
One day, I had the idea of creating my own
“enjoyable trade” by mixing all the things I enjoy doing – renovating,
creating, tinkering, puttering about, and celebrating uniqueness. I wanted to
make my own works of art by transforming mundane objects and creating singular,
eccentric pieces that reflect my vision of life, because I believe that
difference creates a sympathetic challenge, a sort of questioning, but mostly
that it touches people and makes them smile.
The Snoro Company was born of this
desire. Playful, bold, and clever, it is still very young, but its head is
overflowing with ideas... Join me in this wild adventure!       
                            SNORO, c'est qui ? 
SNORO est une jeune compagnie créée par moi, Cbastien Tardif,
artiste de cirque et transformateur d'objets. Passionné par l'anticonformisme,
l'originalité et les choses inusitées, j'ai eu la chance de cultiver cet
enthousiasme dans le domaine des arts du cirque pendant plus de
dix-sept ans. Ce tremplin m'a permis de voyager partout dans le monde, où j'ai
rencontré des types d'architecture, de design et d'art qui m'ont profondément
inspiré. 
                               Who is SNORO? 
Snoro is
a young company created by circus performer and object repurposer Cbastien
Tardif. (That’s me!)Passionate about non-conformity, originality and unusual things, I have had the great opportunity to cultivate this enthusiasm in the field of circus arts for more than seventeen years. This endeavour allowed me to tour the world, where I was exposed to architectural, design and art styles that deeply inspired me.

    Qu'est-ce que SNORO utilise comme matériaux ?


La
plupart des matériaux que j'utilise pour SNORO proviennent de
matières recyclées et d'objets parfois désuets récupérés à même la poubelle
(les résidus de vieille peau de banane et de café ont été soigneusement
éliminés). 
Tous les objets peuvent être transformés, il suffit d'y mettre un peu de
temps, de plaisir et d'imagination...                                                    





                What
materials does SNORO use?
Most materials used by SNORO come from
recycles items, repurposing obsolete objects some of which have sometimes been
pulled out of dumpsters – old banana peels and coffee grounds carefully
removed. 
Any object can be transformed, it just
required a bit of time, playfulness and imagination.
                                               



                                    




                Voici certains matériaux utilisés:

                 Here are some of the materials I use:

En plus d'offrir une sélection d'articles courants, je me ferai un
plaisir de traiter vos commandes personnelles et vos demandes les plus
inusitées. Bref, vos souhaits les plus fous seront exaucés, ka-tching! On
raconte que je suis un genre de... génie (et vous aurez droit à plus de trois
souhaits, c'est garanti!)

                      Nothing is Cbastien-proof!
In addition to offering a selection of current items, it would be a
pleasure to accept your custom orders and your most unusual requests. In
essence, your wildest dreams will be realized, ka-tching! Some say I am a sort
of… ‘‘Genie'' (But you’ll get more than three wishes, guaranteed!)                                  

                   

               Participez à ce merveilleux projet: 
Tout le monde sait que la pensée magique a ses propres limites, et j'ai
besoin de votre aide précieuse ($$$) pour faire avancer SNORO, pour lui
permettre de fleurir et de s'épanouir. Un petit (ou gigantesque) don signifie
beaucoup pour moi. C'est comme si vous me donniez une grosse accolade pour
m'encourager à persévérer et à propulser mes idées vers l'infini... ça c'est
loin!
Vos dons serviront à encourager la récupération, la différence,
l'originalité... et si on extrapole un peu, à sauver notre planète en
péril.  
Concrètement, vos dons serviront à acheter de nouveaux équipements,
un camion de transport fermé, à payer les premiers mois de loyer, à rémunérer
mes collaborateurs (site web, design, etc.), à faire de la publicité, et bien
plus.
On a tous un petit 500 $ qui traîne dans nos poches ou sous notre
matelas... hahaha!
Laissez-vous
aller, pour que je puisse créer, et vous exaucer.




                     Join this wonderful project:
Everybody knows magical thinking has its own limits, and I need your
valuable assistance ($$$) to move Snoro forward, to allow it to bloom and grow.
A small donation (or a gigantic one) will mean a lot to me. It’s as though you
gave me a big hug to encourage me to persevere and push my idea to infinity…
That’s pretty far : )
Your donations will help promote recycling, differentiation and
originality… In concrete terms, these donations will help purchase new
equipment, buy a delivery van, pay a few months’ rent and my collaborators
(website, design, etc.), advertise, and so much more!
We all have $500 or so lying around… Ha! Ha! Ha!
So
please give a little so I can create and fulfill your dreams.

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>We are blessed with opportunity, and given the right tools to succeed to benefit in our own lives. Others around the world are not so lucky. What is driving us in this particular venture is to provide opportunity to those kids that have the skill but have little chance to get to where they want and have the potential to be. We are not only doing this just because it’s a good thing to do but because it's the right things to do. We want to help inspire and provide a chance to someone that needs it. We were fortunate to be given that chance from someone in our lives. So in turn…why shouldn’t we pay-it-forward? </p>

<p><b>Where Does The Money Go:</b></p>
<p>We would like to make it very clear that all money raised during this campaign goes directly into the children's breakfast fund at Granville Primary School located in Trelawny, Jamaica.

<p>An example of just how far your money will go, can be seen in the reviving of the breakfast program: There are approximately 500 children dependent on this program.

Mi nombre es Manuel Alejandro Ruiz y estoy haciendo una campaña para solicitar fondos para cumplir mi sueño de montar una policínica sanitaria. <div> Yo soy nutricionista y me gustaría contar con servicio de nutrición, fisioterapia, podología, psicología, medicina natural, etc. </div><div>
<br/><div>Para ello alquilaré un local en zona céntrica de Granada, haré una página web, contrataré publicidad en medios de comunicación y haré reparto de publicidad en papel en mano.</div>
<div>Aparte de atención en consulta de ofrecerá atención Online y domiciliaria, para no limitar los potenciales clientes a los residentes o personas de paso en la zona y poder atender a aquellas personas que por su situación no pudieran desplazarse.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>COSTE DEL PROYECTO</b></div>
<div>Alquiler del primer mes y fianza: 1000€</div>
<div>Licencia de apertura: 500€</div>
<div>Publicidad en medios y en papel: 500€</div>
<div>Página web: 300€</div>
<div>Mobiliario de la consulta (incluyendo rótulo luminoso exterior): 800€</div>
<div>Registro del nombre de la empresa: 130€</div>
<div>Primer mes de autónomo: 70€</div>
<div>Gastos (luz, teléfono, agua, internet,...) iniciales: 200€</div>
<div>En total el coste sería de 3.500€. Yo podría aportar 1.000€ pero al no tener nómina, ningún banco o caja me financia los 2.500€ restantes, pese a no ser una cantidad muy grande.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>PUNTOS FUERTES</b></div>
<div>Actualmente hay una gran preocupación en torno a la salud, lo que sumado a una buena campaña de publicidad, y el darle al cliente la posibilidad de no acudir presencialmente a la consulta y hacerlo vía internet o mediante la presencia del especialista en su domicilio, sería un gran atractivo.</div>

</div></div>","Buenos días.

Mi nombre es Manuel Alejandro Ruiz y estoy haciendo una campaña para solicitar fondos para cumplir mi sueño de montar una policínica sanitaria.  Yo soy nutricionista y me gustaría contar con servicio de nutrición, fisioterapia, podología, psicología, medicina natural, etc. 
Para ello alquilaré un local en zona céntrica de Granada, haré una página web, contrataré publicidad en medios de comunicación y haré reparto de publicidad en papel en mano.
Aparte de atención en consulta de ofrecerá atención Online y domiciliaria, para no limitar los potenciales clientes a los residentes o personas de paso en la zona y poder atender a aquellas personas que por su situación no pudieran desplazarse.

COSTE DEL PROYECTO
Alquiler del primer mes y fianza: 1000€
Licencia de apertura: 500€
Publicidad en medios y en papel: 500€
Página web: 300€
Mobiliario de la consulta (incluyendo rótulo luminoso exterior): 800€
Registro del nombre de la empresa: 130€
Primer mes de autónomo: 70€
Gastos (luz, teléfono, agua, internet,...) iniciales: 200€
En total el coste sería de 3.500€. Yo podría aportar 1.000€ pero al no tener nómina, ningún banco o caja me financia los 2.500€ restantes, pese a no ser una cantidad muy grande.

PUNTOS FUERTES
Actualmente hay una gran preocupación en torno a la salud, lo que sumado a una buena campaña de publicidad, y el darle al cliente la posibilidad de no acudir presencialmente a la consulta y hacerlo vía internet o mediante la presencia del especialista en su domicilio, sería un gran atractivo.
Igualmente la consulta estaría localizada en una zona de tránsito de gente en Granada, en Camino de Ronda, lo que ayuda a la visibilidad.

PUNTOS DÉBILES
Como cualquier negocio que se pretenda iniciar en esta época de crisis, hay una posibilidad de que no funcione.
Para ello he decidido realizar una inversión pequeña, moderando los gastos a lo estrictamente necesario para un correcto funcionamiento.
En caso de que la consulta en local no funcionara, siempre se podría centrar los esfuerzos de expansión en la consulta Online (ahora en auge), de modo que se pudiera seguir adelante con menos gastos.

EN RESUMEN
Esta es mi idea, mi proyecto. Espero que os haya interesado y os anime a colaborar, aunque sea con lo mínimo.

<p>The true backpacker experience is not only about places and things to see, but the people you would never have met otherwise.  Everyone who helped to create this project met on the road in different places around the world, and are coming from as far away as Australia to help make it a possibility.  Our hostel focuses on travelers, sharing experiences, music, art, and comfort.  We have noticed that few hostels in this city focus on the travelers specifically, but this is all we want to do. We want to hear your music! We want you to paint our walls with your style of art! We want you to share your story with people around the world! And we want you to do it in our house.</p>
<p>Fortaleza is a paradise;  it is surrounded by warm, blue ocean on all sides, it is in close proximity to some of the most beautiful beaches in the world (we're looking at you, Jericoacoara), and is rich with Brazilian culture that is largely undiscovered by the rest of the world.  The city lacks in hostels that cater to the backpackers needs (for example, some places do not even offer toilet paper.) But we plan on changing that by being the first real hostel in the city. We will feature a hostel only bar/lounge so guests can relax, an in house travel agent who can help organize anything from learning kite/wind-surf to buying bus or plane tickets to anywhere around the world, organized activities for those who wish to see the sights and learn the history, nightlife activities for the night owls, and a safe and secure place to call their home for the duration of their stay.</p>

All we need is a boost to the finish, and our hostels personality will insure that we remain players in this game.We went in full sail on this project (yes punny) but have no way, or want, to go back.   Other Ways You Can Help Please share our project.  We are not only just a hostel, but a place to share music and art internationally.  A safe haven for people traveling to Fortaleza.  We are run by people who want to be with other people.  We want to help the community.  If all you can do is spread the word, we appreciate it fully.  We cannot succeed without having other people help spread the word along the way.
There are plenty of Indiegogo share tools to help you to help us, please use them!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>1)  Peanut

<p>
</p><p>2)  Jatropha sheller  -
The same sheller is modified and used to make diesel fuel from the seeds of
the jatropha plant, a sturdy African weed typically used for fencing.</p>
<p>3)  Rocker water pump – The pump, fashioned from old tires, wood, and PVC, uses foot power for irrigation to increase crop yield.</p>
<p>4)  Corn cracker – The device
saves time and effort by cracking whole corn kernels, which would otherwise be discarded by the birds, to use as chicken feed. </p>
<p>5)  Soap for Hope - Soap
donated by Manila Peninsula hotels is collected and recycled by Holy Family School of
Indang. The repackaged soap, created with a soap press designed by Full Belly,
allows communities to produce and distribute recycled soap products to fend off
disease, promote better health, and generate income.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/564190/files/20140507130500-soap_in_Cambodia_with_caption.jpg?1399493100"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>6)  Cotton gin - In some places
in Africa cotton is a commercial crop; the cotton gins are often loaned to
the villagers for a hefty fee. This simple gin reduces a village’s
dependence on outside businessmen and is more effective at separating the cotton
from the seeds.</p>
<p>7)  Plastic recycling/oven –
Jock is developing a solar-powered press that combines plastic trash (collected
by locals) and local plant material (such as grass or palm fronds) and heats
it to 400 deg F. The repurposed plastic can then be used for shingles,
furniture, school desks and chairs, etc.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/577152/files/20140513105847-Jock_and_students_with_desk_and_caption.jpg?1400003927"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/564241/files/20140507131534-full-belly-project-logo-supersmall.png?1399493734"" src="""" style=""""/>     <b>Our Stretch Goal: </b></b><br/></p><p style=""display: inline !important;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></span></p><p>Like any

overseas to work with local groups to get them started. Additional funds would help
us have 8-10 ready to ship at all times by paying for the materials, shop
tools, and defray shipping costs. We have a dream of hiring translators,
technical writers, and engineers to help make the assembly of these products as

saves time and effort by cracking whole corn kernels, which would otherwise be discarded by the birds, to use as chicken feed. 
5)  Soap for Hope - Soap
donated by Manila Peninsula hotels is collected and recycled by Holy Family School of
Indang. The repackaged soap, created with a soap press designed by Full Belly,
allows communities to produce and distribute recycled soap products to fend off
disease, promote better health, and generate income.

6)  Cotton gin - In some places
in Africa cotton is a commercial crop; the cotton gins are often loaned to
the villagers for a hefty fee. This simple gin reduces a village’s
dependence on outside businessmen and is more effective at separating the cotton
from the seeds.
7)  Plastic recycling/oven –
Jock is developing a solar-powered press that combines plastic trash (collected
by locals) and local plant material (such as grass or palm fronds) and heats
it to 400 deg F. The repurposed plastic can then be used for shingles,
furniture, school desks and chairs, etc.     Our Stretch Goal: Like any
successful organization, we DO have a long-term plan in place.  As we look
toward the future, we want to expand our staff and plan to hire a Volunteer Coordinator. We get daily queries about peanut
shellers, and we have a plan to hire and train a team of people to send
overseas to work with local groups to get them started. Additional funds would help
us have 8-10 ready to ship at all times by paying for the materials, shop
tools, and defray shipping costs. We have a dream of hiring translators,
technical writers, and engineers to help make the assembly of these products as
seamless as possible. And we'd love to pay off the mortgage on our shop! So, if
we were lucky enough to raise more than our goal right now, we could use it!

<p>**NOTE: The perks are conditional on the restaurant taking off.  If for some reason we are unable to secure enough funding between IndieGoGo and private sources, we will be donating all funds received to the Food Bank.  WE ARE NOT KEEPING ANY MONEY UNLESS WE HIT OUR GOALS**</p>
<h3>The Skinny</h3>
<p>This is more or less going to be a paraphrased transcript of my video, because that's what it's all about.</p>
<p>My name is Jean-Guy Rouleau, my father is André and my mother Jacqui.</p>
<p>In short, we're trying to start a restaurant.  We've wanted to for many years but never had the right opportunity.</p>
<p>My father was a cook/chef for 20-something years.  My mother has been a waitress and cashier for many years as well.  I've never professionally worked in a restaurant, aside from helping my father, but I have a deep passion for cooking.</p>
<p>We also have great pride in our community and always try to help out when we can.</p>
<p>My father left the industry after he began losing the passion; the people he was working for didn't care about restaurants, they only cared about the money.  We've hosted many events at our home, and those of friends and family. He's always said that he would get back into it, but only if he had his own place, so that he wouldn't run the risk of losing the passion and creativity by having to bend to someone else's will.</p>
<p>Recently, the local ""bar"" owner has decided to sell.  Many residents are sad to see it go, as are we.  Being that my father and mother both have a lot of experience in the industry, we thought it would be perfect if we were to take over.</p>
<p>The current owner just purchased the restaurant less than a year ago, but has admittedly run it into the ground, so she's selling it.  She tried to turn the restaurant into a bar, but this is not the right neighbourhood for that; we need a restaurant.</p>
<p>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for us.  What we want to do is bring it back to being a casual dining family restaurant, with strong ties to the community, hence why the current working name is Neighbourhood Grill &amp; Lounge.  (Though that name might change once we get it up and running...it's a close tie with ""Our Place"".  Imagine the conversation:  ""C'mon over to Our Place for dinner!""  How often do you hear people say that, right?)</p>
<p>Since we moved to this community 15 years ago, we have not been strangers: we've helped our neighbours with repairs and renovations, we've donated furniture, clothes and electronics, given away fresh produce from our garden...we've even held BBQs at no cost. We want to continue this giving philosophy with the restaurant, even increasing our community presence and involvement.</p>
<p>The only thing we're missing is money, which is why we're here.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's In It For Us...And You!</h3>
<p>We're asking for $200,000 to hit our goal: this covers the cost of buying her business, plus all the chattels; tables, chairs, kitchen equipment (the most expensive part) and it also covers our start up expenses and a few months of operating expenses, just while we get the place up and running.</p>
<p>It's a flexible funding campaign, so even if we don't hit the $200,000, we'll get the funding (minus IndieGoGo's 9% fee). With that, we'll use it as ammunition to go to a bank or investors to get the remainder.</p>
<p>Check out the perks to the side.  If you happen to be able to, and want to donate more than the perk levels listed, please contact me first - we might be able to work out a custom perk for you based on how much you're looking to give.</p>
<p>Every person who contributes will have their name listed on a special page of our website AND written in a book, placed on a mantle or shelf or somewhere visible in the restaurant.  Contributors of $250 or more will have their names engraved on a plaque which will get hung up on a wall where the book is; after all, without your support we wouldn't be able to do this, and it makes sense that you receive recognition.</p>
<p>We will also maintain a registry of the perks for redemption, so no pesky mailing out vouchers or whatnot.  You give us your info and we write it in a book, you show up with ID (or if you prefer, we could e-mail you a certificate to print), we have you sign the registry to confirm that you redeemed.  Simple.</p>
<p>If for some reason we cannot secure enough funding and the restaurant does not take off, we will not be keeping any of these funds; following our community involvement philosophy, we'll be donating the money to the Food Bank.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Happens If We Get It?</h3>
<p>Once we get up and running, we plan on being very active in the community.  Performing fundraising dinners for down-on-their-luck families.  Providing low-cost meals to low income families during the holidays.  Helping out our local Goodwill with on-the-job training to help people secure employment in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>The list goes on, but suffice to say that we are very giving and plan on doing all that we can to help the community that helps us.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What If I Don't Have Money To Give?</h3>
<p>If you can't help financially, that's okay too!  Just getting the word out and making a ruckus is a fantastic help!</p>
<p>The more people know about this, the more likely we are to reach our goal.  Anything you can do for us is greatly appreciated!</p>

<h3>Reasons to give...</h3>
<p>I am asking for donations on behalf of my sister Bri. She was diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma in the Fall of 2012. She lives on her own, far from any family. She's been going to all her appointments and treatments by herself in a truck that is on its last leg. I wish with all my heart that I could just stop everything and just move down there to help her. She is truly a remarkable person, with a huge heart. And she is the best Aunt I could have asked for, for my three girls. If anyone in my family could just buy her a car on their own, we would do it in a heartbeat. So we are asking for any help anyone reading this can give. You would be helping take a huge weight off of her shoulders. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need at least enough for a down payment for a more reliable car. We're not looking for a brand new, fancy vehicle. Just one we don't need to worry about breaking down on her.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we don't have too much to give as perks, but thank you cards and drawings from her neices will definately be involved.</p>
<p>All the donations will go towards getting her a new car. If we (hopefully) go over our goal, the rest will go towards the 20% of her medical bills that she is currently paying out of pocket.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Sincere thank you...</h3>
<p>If you can give, even a small amount...thank you from the bottom of my heart. Our family thanks you, and my daughters thank you for helping take any stress out of their Aunt BB's life while she's trying to beat this stupid thing call cancer.</p>

</div></div>","In order to make our clients visiting Port Grimaud and show our properties for sale and for rent we would need to buy a boat... with your help. Would you mind ?
What / Where is Port Grimaud ?
Port Grimaud is a unique ""Lakeside Village"" in France, also called the French
Venice, where every homeowner can moor a boat in front of his or her house. A magical
place where people can feel the specific atmosphere of a ""French Provençal"" village from southeast France.
Port Grimaud is located just
in front of St. Tropez in the Gulf.

people all over the world to come and discover Port Grimaud at least once in
their lifetime and live a house-with-mooring experience down here for their
holidays. 

Port Grimaud is a safe and peaceful city for people who are looking to
combine tranquility and wonder during their holiday.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Welcome to our campaign. 
We are a small, energetic team from Hungary. It is a family-business. 
Gábor is the owner and Gabriella has the swivel chair job in the company. 



For years we have been working with electrical monitoring. 
3 years ago we had a baby-boy, Misu. Misu is an Autist. 
So, our life has changed. 
We slept little. But we learnt a lot. 
Over the years we  learnt to say: our child is an Autist. 
And we learnt to ask for help.  
Helping an autistic child is very hard because this disability is not always visible. 
We found a way how to show people our needs. 
We had some T-shirts made for Misu and for us and our world has changed. 




It's
like the white cane for the blind. 
Without the cane we do not realise that
somebody is in need, but as soon as we see the cane we jump there to help. 
So
we made T-shirts for the whole Autist-parent community and it worked. 
Meanwhile
we realised that the rest of the family, who help us, could also make use of
T-shirts like this to promote proudly that Autism is not a disease, Autism is
not a shame, but Autism is the combination of a gift, adventure, love and
wisdom. 
Our aim is to establish a web-shop in Europe
where T-shirts, bags, mugs, stickers, jewellery and other accessories with
positive messages would be sold for Autistic children, parents, siblings,
grandparents, cousins and developing-teachers. The products would be made on
the language of the customer, but they will also be available in English. Our
greatest objective is to make the Autism spectrum state widely known, to help
parents like us see the state of their child as a gift and those who are not
concerned to accept and support Autistic life.
  What We Need & What You Get To open the web-shop, make the copyright of the
trademark and the graphics, to collect the basic stockpile and launch the
advertisements we need $12 000. 
The production of one T-shirt costs about $11.
The patent
fees about $280. 
The purchase of legal software and the establishment of the
web-shop $1600. 
We intend to employ two Autist-mothers with flexible working
hours in the web-shop 
We are going to send every supporter a thank you letter. 
Every
supporter over $20 receives a mug.
Supporters over $50 a supporter T-shirt in the
selected colour, pattern and size.
Supporters over $100 will get a T-shirt,
a mug, and a bag full of love.
  The Impact
Our project is not only valuable to the contributors but really is to the whole world. 
We would like to help autistic families to get more support and help and also we want to help people who can not see the needs of autistic families. 
Autistic kids need acceptance, patience, sense of humour and love. With our T-shirts and other goods they can get them more easily. 

  Risks & Challenges It is really hard to get acceptance enough in Eastern European countries. 
With the help of our contributors we would like to open people's eyes and we want to talk about the importance of acceptance and learning. 
We do believe in goodness of humans and that they only need some guide how to notice some diasbilities.

I grew up in a less-industrialized Southeast Asian country. I learned how to cook at age 11. Every morning, I rode my bicycle to my neighborhood farmers market to grab vegetables, grains, legumes and wild-caught fish. I helped my parents raise a dozen naturally-fed free-range chickens and ducks. We grew herbs, vegetables and fruits. I picked guavas, mangoes, papayas, cherimoyas and jackfruits ripen on the trees. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1356982/files/20150405112045-holding_chicken_resized.jpg?1428258045"" src="""" style=""""/></p>In pursuit of a degree in journalism, I came to Pittsburgh.

A Pittsburgh Post-Gazette food writer called me a ""citizen of the world.""<br/><br/>Having worked in several restaurants in the East Coast for more than a decade, I do not imagine my own place to be a stuffy conventional bar/ restaurant type.

</div></div>","A different kind of bar on the South Side to serve organic raw juices, breakfast, lunch & dinner
I'm a 98-pound chef who makes much-dreaded super clean and healthy eating tempting and addictive...in a good way. I believe that indulging and comforting everyday food can be tastefully healthy with careful preparation and ingredients nature gives us. I'm excited to announce the launch of my new venture: extraVEGANza Pgh. 
For the past two years since I began my solo entrepreneurial journey to do something different, I have transformed and improved the lives of many clients and customers. I now have like-minded people helping me along the way. With their continued support, I'm now able to grow my business and take it to the next level. I'm the chef behind the monthly 14-item vegan brunch series that has received press write-ups (like this recent one linked to two more) and loyal following of customers who pay in advance for 12 months. The brunch gets discovered by out-of-towners from as far as Austin, Texas. No worries...this is not the end of the (brunch) as I understand my brunch is life changing and equals the world to some of you. It will still be served on the second Saturday of every month as always. Breakfast, lunch and dinner will be served five days a week Tuesday through Saturday. If you read this far already, I feel your love and know that this campaign will reach its goal in 21 days.

We promise we won't make a dime off of any of this (in fact we'll be paying the 9% Indiegogo fundraising fees from our own pockets) and our goal is for 100% of the money raised go directly to help those impacted by the floods.   

    Other Ways You Can Help We understand some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help. Here are a few other ways you can help Central Texas flood victims, either by donating or volunteering (courtesy of KVUE):  Tell others about our campaign!

</div></div>","Our Story

My name is Suzy V and I have a huge passion for helping others. I'm apart of Church on the Journey and we've been raising money for over 2 years to build an orphanage in Nyeri, Kenya.  This July we have the life-changing opportunity to go to Kenya and make this dream a reality. 


The Impact

Our primary purpose in going to Kenya is to assist in getting Belwop Rescue Center up and running. This orphanage will house up to a 100 children, feed them, educate them and set them up to live out the incredible dreams that God has for their lives. 

Each day we will be working hard on the new Belwop Rescue Center building. Then during the nights we will be doing various programs and activities with the kids. Our goal is to give them a great new home as well as show them the love of Christ by building strong relationships with them and showering them with love and care. 

Church on the Journey has worked hard to raise money for this orphanage, and without your support we won't be able to travel to Kenya and build these orphans a new home. 



What We Need & What You Get

First, I need my friends and family to pray for me. Second, I need your financial assistance.  My total cost for this trip is $4,000.  I am asking you to prayerfully consider making a one-time gift. 

By March 11, I need to raise 2,500 for a plane ticket. The remaining money will go towards lodging, food, and other transportation.  I've also created perks for those who give. If you give $10, I'll give you a personal shout out on facebook/twitter. If you give $25, I'll give you the previous shout out plus a personalized postcard from Kenya. If you give $50, I'll give you the previous plus a photo of a child who will live in the Belwop Recuse Center. If you give $100, I'll give you a personal shout out on facebook and twitter plus a 30 minute photo session of your choice. If you give $300, I'll give you a 90 minute photo session including a cd of edited photos.

<h3>We are the Mason family! We are a special needs adoptive family in Texas. We have adopted a total of seven children! Five of those children are special needs.

Our beautiful daughter Christina, is eleven years old and has a condition called hydranencephaly. She was born missing most of her brain. She is truly a miracle child and is happy and healthy.

He is also Spina Bifida and his first wheelchair is currently on order. He is a happy little guy and can't wait to get out and about in his new chair! And the latest little Mason addition is Sophia, who also was born with hydranencephaly, like her big sister Chrissy. She is six months old now, but will be big enough for a wheelchair next year.</h3>
<h3>Currently, the Mason's are making do with a wheelchair lift equipped van that they bought used three years ago (it is a 2000 Chevy) when they only had Chrissy and Stephen in wheelchairs.

</p>
<p>Vietnam
is no longer on the list of underdeveloped countries; yet, in both rural and
urban areas of Vietnam there are families still living below the poverty line.
We, STEP Forward Exchange - a youth lead initiative, work to bridge the socio-economic
gap by providing a platform for disadvantaged families in rural areas of the <b>Mekong
Delta region of southern Vietnam</b>. We focus on improving the livelihood of
those are living in poverty-stricken circumstances, in particular women and
children.</p>
<p><b>“Brick by Brick” </b>is the first step
for us in realising our goal. Earlier this year, we visited families in Tam Binh District,
Vinh Long Province, Vietnam. Inevitably, it was a challenge to select a single
family that was arguably most in need. Nevertheless, we met with one family that
not only needs immediate support in terms of housing but also support in
securing long-term financial sustainability and self-sufficiency. </p>
<br/>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>THE FAMILY 
</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p>
StepForward visited Anh Trung and his family in September 2014. Trung,
34, works as an independent construction worker in the local area. Trung works
on a ‘pay as you work’ basis, meaning if there is no work available, there is
no salary for him and the family. During the rainy season, work is often cut
short due to monsoons and local companies prefer to rely on their fixed staff,
ironically “drying up” chances for Trung to work. If he is unable to find work,
he will look for other jobs but without a proper skill-set; these are menial,
low paying jobs that don’t provide a concrete platform for his family. <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1108606/files/20141220063350-download__2_.png?1419086030"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
(Trung's house from inside)<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1108596/files/20141220063003-P1010356.jpg?1419085803"" src="""" style=""width: 307.987212276215px; height: 411px;""/></p>
<p>(Kitchen corner)</p>
<p>
In addition, Trung’s wife, Dao, work far away from home in a factory in
another area of Vinh Long. Due to the distance, Dao must stay in the area to
work for weeks at a time. Once the cost of living at her worksite is discounted
from her salary it is nowhere near enough to support the family on a monthly
basis. Most of this income is used to support their nine year-old son, Nghia,
who is currently attending primary school<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1108604/files/20141220063221-download__3_.jpg?1419085941"" src="""" style=""width: 413.333333333333px; height: 310px;""/></p>

Nghia was recently in a serious motorbike accident and required four
operations and a one-month stay in hospital. What funds the family
did have were sapped by the unexpected but necessary expense and the family now
find themselves in a particularly difficult situation.Despite
this setback, Nghia is back at school where he has proven a good student, with
the school often praising his achievement. However; with the cost of school tuition
and continued medical expenses, he could potentially be forced to give up his education
anytime. We believe higher education and higher understanding
to be key tools for economic and social development and Nghia leaving school
would be a step backward for a student with such promise.This
is a regular occurrence and does not only apply to Nghia, as different
generations find themselves stuck in the poverty cycle and are often forced to
leave school to find work. StepForward will work to break this cycle and
improve the family’s quality of living through improved housing conditions and
economic stability.<br/><p></p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>How it works?<br/><br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>StepForward
will<b> relocate the family to brand new accommodation </b>built on
the site of their current home. As of now, the family are living in a house
constructed mainly of bamboo, dried leaves and tree branches, one side of the
house is currently protected by a large tarp which in particular does not
provide much protection from the elements. The house is built next to a stream
and although it is slightly raised, is still at risk of flooding especially
owing to the low quality of materials in use. We plan to comfortably
accommodate the family in a small, two-roomed house comprising of a shared
bedroom and a living space fit with kitchen area and potential to be utilised
as a separate sleeping area if required. The house’ foundations will be raisied
to prevent flooding and will be constructed from brick and iron providing
proper protection from all weather conditions. There will also be a small
bathroom built separately to the house, currently the family are without toilet
facilities and are either using their neighbours’ or using the open area around
their house which is extremely unsanitary in the long-term.</p>
<br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1108637/files/20141220065656-download.png?1419087416"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/>
<p>
</p>
<p>We will
also invest in <b>a small micro-finance loan </b>for the family to
set up and run their own business. The fund is 5 million VND ($236 USD) for a
small chicken farming enterprise and vegetable garden for personal and business
use. This initial investment will be repaid after one year by which time, the
business should be in profit and beneficiaries can move forward independently
with consistent, guaranteed income. 3 million VND will be utilised towards the
construction of a chicken coop, 8-10 chicks and chicken feed to cover a 6-month
period. Each chicken has a three-month cycle of growth before they are taken to
market to be sold by the kilogram. The remaining funds will be used to build a
vegetable garden and provide equipment to support maintenance. Products can also
be sold to both neighbours and the local market. This should allow for four
cycles before the loan repayment with the family left in a strong position. The
initial fund than can be used to support other families in the region.</p>
<p>As well
as this, StepForward will commit to a <b>full one-year scholarship for
Nghia,</b> which will have the option to be renewed on a yearly basis
depending on performance and attendance. The scholarship will cover educational
costs including tuition, uniform, text and notebooks and all other school
equipment. This will also link in with our long-term microfinance objective as
we encourage the family to become self-sufficient and be in a position to
retake full financial responsibility for education having seen the benefits
through unclouded eyes.</p>

<br/><h1><b> <br/>Why we are helping the Family<br/>
</b></h1>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>We are
not simply building a house. We are building a future.</b></p>
<p>Despite
the overall benefits of Vietnam’s progression into a developing country, it can
be argued that this rapid development has played a part in the widening social
divide. The lack a well-functioning social welfare system has left
disadvantaged families in particular, without the support and opportunities
available that will allow them to break from the poverty cycle. </p>
<p>StepForward
wants to offer this support to the community provided that beneficiaries commit
making the most of the opportunities we aim to provide. This family is young
and hardworking, yet their resources are limited and have little if any support
in their efforts to improve their livelihood. We will provide new accommodation
to better their living conditions and as a result, improve the family’s health.
Adequate housing is a basic human right and its provision dramatically improves
social well-being.As well as this, a loan for a small family business will ensure
economic sustainability and also give them the opportunity to earn their business
and make it their own as the initial investment is repaid after a one year
term. The child is well recognised by his school and a small donation towards
his education could lead to brighter future than his parents right now. </p>
<h1><b><br/></b></h1>
<h1><b>Proposed Final Outcome </b></h1>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>StepFoward’s
target results are both immediate and long-term. Breaking from the cycle of
poverty is a process that requires investment from both StepForward and project
beneficiaries. We will see an immediate result upon completion of the house, as
the family can relocate from sub-standard, high-risk housing to safe and
comfortable accommodation. This development should allow beneficiaries to focus
on the long-term goal of financial independence and security.</p>

With the successful application of our microfinance loan, the family can
achieve a sustainable and self-sufficient lifestyle, improving the quality of
life and as result encourage the realisation of other opportunities in business
and particularly, education. Education is a key tool for future development and
by alleviating beneficiaries from poverty and encouraging further study, higher
education can become a reality for those who previously thought it
inaccessible. With the completion of ‘Brick by Brick’, beneficiaries will break
from the poverty cycle, with the provision of quality housing as well as the
confidence and resources to take a ‘Step Forward’ to financial stability and
educational opportunity.<br/>

Vietnam
is no longer on the list of underdeveloped countries; yet, in both rural and
urban areas of Vietnam there are families still living below the poverty line.
We, STEP Forward Exchange - a youth lead initiative, work to bridge the socio-economic
gap by providing a platform for disadvantaged families in rural areas of the Mekong
Delta region of southern Vietnam. We focus on improving the livelihood of
those are living in poverty-stricken circumstances, in particular women and
children.
“Brick by Brick” is the first step
for us in realising our goal. Earlier this year, we visited families in Tam Binh District,
Vinh Long Province, Vietnam. Inevitably, it was a challenge to select a single
family that was arguably most in need. Nevertheless, we met with one family that
not only needs immediate support in terms of housing but also support in
securing long-term financial sustainability and self-sufficiency. 

   THE FAMILY 



StepForward visited Anh Trung and his family in September 2014. Trung,
34, works as an independent construction worker in the local area. Trung works
on a ‘pay as you work’ basis, meaning if there is no work available, there is
no salary for him and the family. During the rainy season, work is often cut
short due to monsoons and local companies prefer to rely on their fixed staff,
ironically “drying up” chances for Trung to work. If he is unable to find work,
he will look for other jobs but without a proper skill-set; these are menial,
low paying jobs that don’t provide a concrete platform for his family. 

(Trung's house from inside)
(Kitchen corner)

In addition, Trung’s wife, Dao, work far away from home in a factory in
another area of Vinh Long. Due to the distance, Dao must stay in the area to
work for weeks at a time. Once the cost of living at her worksite is discounted
from her salary it is nowhere near enough to support the family on a monthly
basis. Most of this income is used to support their nine year-old son, Nghia,
who is currently attending primary school




Nghia was recently in a serious motorbike accident and required four
operations and a one-month stay in hospital. What funds the family
did have were sapped by the unexpected but necessary expense and the family now
find themselves in a particularly difficult situation.Despite
this setback, Nghia is back at school where he has proven a good student, with
the school often praising his achievement. However; with the cost of school tuition
and continued medical expenses, he could potentially be forced to give up his education
anytime. We believe higher education and higher understanding
to be key tools for economic and social development and Nghia leaving school
would be a step backward for a student with such promise.This
is a regular occurrence and does not only apply to Nghia, as different
generations find themselves stuck in the poverty cycle and are often forced to
leave school to find work. StepForward will work to break this cycle and
improve the family’s quality of living through improved housing conditions and
economic stability.


How it works?



StepForward
will relocate the family to brand new accommodation built on
the site of their current home. As of now, the family are living in a house
constructed mainly of bamboo, dried leaves and tree branches, one side of the
house is currently protected by a large tarp which in particular does not
provide much protection from the elements. The house is built next to a stream
and although it is slightly raised, is still at risk of flooding especially
owing to the low quality of materials in use. We plan to comfortably
accommodate the family in a small, two-roomed house comprising of a shared
bedroom and a living space fit with kitchen area and potential to be utilised
as a separate sleeping area if required. The house’ foundations will be raisied
to prevent flooding and will be constructed from brick and iron providing
proper protection from all weather conditions. There will also be a small
bathroom built separately to the house, currently the family are without toilet
facilities and are either using their neighbours’ or using the open area around
their house which is extremely unsanitary in the long-term.





We will
also invest in a small micro-finance loan for the family to
set up and run their own business. The fund is 5 million VND ($236 USD) for a
small chicken farming enterprise and vegetable garden for personal and business
use. This initial investment will be repaid after one year by which time, the
business should be in profit and beneficiaries can move forward independently
with consistent, guaranteed income. 3 million VND will be utilised towards the
construction of a chicken coop, 8-10 chicks and chicken feed to cover a 6-month
period. Each chicken has a three-month cycle of growth before they are taken to
market to be sold by the kilogram. The remaining funds will be used to build a
vegetable garden and provide equipment to support maintenance. Products can also
be sold to both neighbours and the local market. This should allow for four
cycles before the loan repayment with the family left in a strong position. The
initial fund than can be used to support other families in the region.
As well
as this, StepForward will commit to a full one-year scholarship for
Nghia, which will have the option to be renewed on a yearly basis
depending on performance and attendance. The scholarship will cover educational
costs including tuition, uniform, text and notebooks and all other school
equipment. This will also link in with our long-term microfinance objective as
we encourage the family to become self-sufficient and be in a position to
retake full financial responsibility for education having seen the benefits
through unclouded eyes.




 Why we are helping the Family


We are
not simply building a house. We are building a future.
Despite
the overall benefits of Vietnam’s progression into a developing country, it can
be argued that this rapid development has played a part in the widening social
divide. The lack a well-functioning social welfare system has left
disadvantaged families in particular, without the support and opportunities
available that will allow them to break from the poverty cycle. 
StepForward

Proposed Final Outcome 



StepFoward’s
target results are both immediate and long-term. Breaking from the cycle of
poverty is a process that requires investment from both StepForward and project
beneficiaries. We will see an immediate result upon completion of the house, as
the family can relocate from sub-standard, high-risk housing to safe and
comfortable accommodation. This development should allow beneficiaries to focus
on the long-term goal of financial independence and security.

happened?</b><br/></p><p>
<b>October
13th 2014 </b>
</p>
<p>
It
was a Monday with a strong storm.</p>
<p>
Was
few days of intense raining weather around the extended area between
3 regions in the north-west of Italy (Liguria-Tuscany &amp; Emilia
Romagna) 
</p>
<p>
That
afternoon something goes wrong.</p>
<p>
The
little stream called “Baganza” - affluent of the main one with
same name of the city: “Parma” - it got an extra water capacity
since the beginning of the day, above on mountains, where it brought
down the installation of the pool of the Berceto Village.</p>
<p>
It
was a mix of water, debris, mud, everything it could take away and
sewers too.</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<p>
<b>4.15
		PM – The beginning of a dangerous situation</b></p>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>
My
Mom and I (plus our 4 dogs) were inside the house during the bad
weather as usual during a storm. 
</p>
<p>
At
a certain point the electricity fails.</p>
<p>
This
make us a bit in alarm, then we decide to go out and check if others
get the same. 
</p>
<p>
In
a first moment we just hear a loud noise of water - the traffic was
completely out - but we wanted to ensure that wasn't the main river
“Parma” swollen; in fact was not from there the problem (even if
it was on the max level); the really danger was from the “other
side” from “Baganza” stream that overflowed and invaded
streets, parks, sidewalks, garages and my HOUSE!!! 
</p>
<p>
<b>WE
SAW THE DEATH IN FACE!  </b>
</p>
<p>
We
were outside – We have seen the water of a grey color coming to our
direction and in the same time the manholes flow up like a fountain! 
</p>
<p>
I
got few seconds to release what was going on and run to keep us and
the 4 dogs safe.</p>
<p>
In
that moment the first thing on mind was to <b>STAY ALIVE! </b><br/>We
RUN so fast with that grey water - running fast as well - on our
back. 
</p>
<p>
I
don't know how I found the right key to open the door then came
inside but the flood was coming inside too from the crevices under
the door, windows, walls.</p>
<p>
I
hear the rumble of water....</p>
<p>
I
screamed to my mom: <b>“Keep safe the dogs on first floor!”</b></p>
<p>
We
escaped on first floor . Only one room and a balcony looking outside
ALL the water invading ours front yard, gazebo, doghouse. 
</p>
<p>
The
same “scenario” was happening INSIDE with ALL the things, stuff,
tools, furniture, clothes, shoes, food, documents, books,
photographs, memories.... 
</p>
<p>
In
a blink of an eye..... our LIFE was blown away!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1216869/files/20150212072516-2014-10-13_17.44_-_Auto_and_Flood.png?1423754716"" src="""" style=""width: 347.25px; height: 463px;""/></p><p><b>5.30PM
– 1 hour of Water Hell </b>
</p>
<p>
We
spent the rest of the afternoon – till 8 o'clock in the evening -
at the balcony screaming for HELP!!! - The water noise was over any
voice! <br/>The phone lines were totally out - for the emergency - and
also because in the flood area was the telecommunications central
that was completely submerged. 
</p>
<p>
We
were <u>REALLY DESPERATE!</u></p>
<p>
<b>8.00PM
– 2 Fireman like 2 Angels </b>
</p>
<p>
After
3 hours of exhausted &amp; loud screaming: “HELP HERE! WE ARE
TRAPPED WITH 4 DOGS!!! WE HAVE NOTHING TO EAT! NO ELECTRICITY!” - [
no electricity inside the house and outside in the street!!!] <br/>We
waited so long the relief for two fundamental facts: 1) in the area
was in emergency also an Hospital and an Home for the elderly to
evacuate... 2) our house is hidden from the main street, that's why
nobody was able to understand where to find a way to reach the place.</p>
<p>
Anyway
just in time – at evening - before the deep night came down - 2
Fireman (from another little village) – that were in town for a
casual combination – with a basic track (without the big staircase)
got the call of emergency and they came right there to give us  some
help! <br/>Immediately the situation appeared critical &amp; very
dangerous for ALL of us! <br/>Fireman ordered us to <u><b>EVACUATE
INSTANTLY!!!</b></u>
</p>
<p>
The
2 Fireman came inside walking some steps of the front yard completely
full of water and mud (approximately 1mt &amp; 20 cm)! 
</p>
<p>
They
tried once at the main door but the water pressure and things inside
were blocking the entrance... 
</p>
<p>
Then
they tried on the secondary door that was a bit more free from
obstacles.... after few assessment to find the right way of
escape.... the only one was to came down from the first floor and
going inside the water/mud that was flooded in at 1mt &amp; 20 cm
also INSIDE the HOUSE in ALL rooms at ground floor.... 
</p>
<p>
A
bit of perplexity mixed up to fear, despair and a sense of loss...
thinking to put just one feet on that water was disturbing.... but
was our only possibility..... then we prepared – with very few
things you can bring in the darkness, also things that you don't need
but in that moment your mind it's in SHOCK and is missing some logic
functions to stay focused – anyway we were ready to go down from
the stairs with 2 dogs at a time in arms with the fireman ahead of us
to guide in that mess: my mom with Theo &amp; Buffy with me inside a
summer bag. (other 2 dogs - Mapo &amp; Ariel - has been recovered
just some moment after in the same way!) 
</p>
<p>
We
succeeded to keep them safe &amp; dry for what was possible, but they
didn't touched that “kind of water”, conversely to us that we
owed to soak up at waist!!! 
</p>
<p>
After
that in a SHOCKED state of mind and completely dirty and wet, we run
away with the 4 dogs in the car (that miraculously has been safe up
in the parking!!!)  to our relatives that in emergency give us
hospitality for 2 days on a sofa and few days a stall for dogs.

</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
<b>THE
DAY AFTER: A long day of strange feelings and working on</b></p>
<p>
The
day after started very early in a state of bad feelings – as you
can imagine I didn't slept so well that night!!! 
</p>
<p>
We
came at “WHAT” 24 hours before was still my house, and the “show”
was really, really miserable, a feeling of impotence in front of all
that mud, water that got the lower level but still there! Walking
over it was like wet quicksand!  - Horrible thing! 
</p>
<p>
We
worked a lot for all the day long to put away the the things and
trying to draw the water with pumps with the HELP of Hundreds of
Teenagers that offered their help, time and smile to us and in the
whole area hit by the flood! <br/>Since the beginning their presence
has been so efficient and important, so significant that after they
has been called “<b>Angeli del fango</b>” (Mud's Angels!) 
</p>
<p>
We
worked so hard I the first place of the 2 weeks after the disaster
and then has been decided to put in safety the whole house making a
significant restructuring that is still on the working progress right
now after 3 months and a half!

<p>
</p>
<p><b>13
ottobre 2014</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>E'
stato un Lunedi con un forte temporale.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Erano
un paio di giorni di intensa pioggia intorno l'area estesa tra le 3
regioni del Nord-Ovest d'Italia (Liguria-Toscana e Emilia Romagna)</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Quel
pomeriggio qualcosa è andato storto.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Il
piccolo torrente ""Baganza"" - affluente di quello principale
- con lo stesso nome della città: ""Parma"" – era in piena
eccezionale  fin dall'inizio della giornata, su  in montagna,  ha
portato  via l'installazione della piscina di Berceto.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>E'
stato un mix di acqua, detriti, fango, tutto ciò che poteva portare
via altre alle fogne naturalmente.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>16:15

<p>
</p>
<p>Io
e mia mamma (più i nostri 4 cani) eravamo all'interno della casa
durante il temporale, come al solito durante una tempesta.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A
un certo punto viene a mancare la corrente.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Questo
ci mette in allarme, quindi decidiamo di andare fuori e verificare se

un primo momento abbiamo solo sentito un forte rumore d'acqua - il
traffico era completamente in tilt - ma abbiamo voluto assicurarci
che non fosse il fiume principale ""Parma"" in piena; infatti
non era da lì il problema (anche se il livello dell'acqua era al
massimo); il vero pericolo proveniva dall'altro lato del ""Baganza"",
che traboccava innondando strade, parchi, marciapiedi, garage e la
mia CASA !!!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>ABBIAMO

<p>
</p>
<p>Eravamo
appena fuori casa quando abbiamo visto arrivare l'acqua di un colore
grigio venire nella nostra direzione e nello stesso tempo i tombini
che sgorgavano come una fontana!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Ho
avuto pochi secondi per realizzare quello che stava succedendo e
correre verso casa e mettere i nostri 4 cani al sicuro.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In
quel momento la prima cosa a cui ho pensato è stato quello di

<p>Correvamo
così veloce con l'acqua grigia (velocissima) alle calcagna!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Non
so come ho trovato la chiave giusta per aprire la porta, ma l'acqua
ha iniziato ad entrare anche all'interno della casa attraverso la
fessura sotto la porta, finestre, muri.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Sento
il gorgogliare dell'acqua ....</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Ho
gridato a mia madre: ""<b>porta i cani al primo piano!</b>” 
(unico piano disponibile)</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Siamo
fuggite al primo piano. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Solo
una camera e un balcone che si affaccia sul cortile di fronte dove
abbiamo visto l'acqua invadere tutto quanto: ombrellone, tavolo,

<p>
</p>

</p>
<p><b>05:30

<p>
</p>
<p>Le
linee telefoniche erano totalmente fuori uso, perché nella zona dell'innondazione è presente la centrale delle telecomunicazioni, che è
stata completamente sommersa.</p>

</p>
<p><b>08:00

<p>
</p>
<p>Abbiamo
aspettato così a lungo il soccorsi per due fatti fondamentali: 1)
nella zona di emergenza è presente anche un ospedale ed una casa per
gli anziani da evacuare ... 2) la nostra casa è nascosta dalla
strada principale, è per questo che nessuno è stato in grado di
capire tempestivamente dove trovare un modo per raggiungerla.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Comunque
appena in tempo verso sera – prima che scendesse la notte – 2

<p>

alternativa era quella di scendere al piano terra completamente
invaso dall'acqua e dal fango!</p>
<p>Un
po 'di perplessità mescolato alla paura, disperazione e un senso di

<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>In
quello stato di <b>SHOCK</b> e così sporhe e fradice siamo corse via
con i 4 cani salvati, in macchina (che miracolosamente era rimasta

happened?
October
13th 2014 


It
was a Monday with a strong storm.

Was
few days of intense raining weather around the extended area between
3 regions in the north-west of Italy (Liguria-Tuscany & Emilia
Romagna) 


That
afternoon something goes wrong.

The
little stream called “Baganza” - affluent of the main one with
same name of the city: “Parma” - it got an extra water capacity
since the beginning of the day, above on mountains, where it brought
down the installation of the pool of the Berceto Village.

It
was a mix of water, debris, mud, everything it could take away and
sewers too.



4.15
		PM – The beginning of a dangerous situation



My
Mom and I (plus our 4 dogs) were inside the house during the bad
weather as usual during a storm. 


At
a certain point the electricity fails.

This
make us a bit in alarm, then we decide to go out and check if others
get the same. 


In
a first moment we just hear a loud noise of water - the traffic was
completely out - but we wanted to ensure that wasn't the main river
“Parma” swollen; in fact was not from there the problem (even if
it was on the max level); the really danger was from the “other
side” from “Baganza” stream that overflowed and invaded
streets, parks, sidewalks, garages and my HOUSE!!! 


WE
SAW THE DEATH IN FACE!  


We
were outside – We have seen the water of a grey color coming to our
direction and in the same time the manholes flow up like a fountain! 


I
got few seconds to release what was going on and run to keep us and
the 4 dogs safe.

In
that moment the first thing on mind was to STAY ALIVE! We
RUN so fast with that grey water - running fast as well - on our
back. 


I
don't know how I found the right key to open the door then came
inside but the flood was coming inside too from the crevices under
the door, windows, walls.

I
hear the rumble of water....

I
screamed to my mom: “Keep safe the dogs on first floor!”

We
escaped on first floor . Only one room and a balcony looking outside
ALL the water invading ours front yard, gazebo, doghouse. 


The
same “scenario” was happening INSIDE with ALL the things, stuff,
tools, furniture, clothes, shoes, food, documents, books,
photographs, memories.... 


In
a blink of an eye..... our LIFE was blown away!5.30PM
– 1 hour of Water Hell 


We
spent the rest of the afternoon – till 8 o'clock in the evening -
at the balcony screaming for HELP!!! - The water noise was over any
voice! The phone lines were totally out - for the emergency - and
also because in the flood area was the telecommunications central
that was completely submerged. 


We
were REALLY DESPERATE!

8.00PM
– 2 Fireman like 2 Angels 


After
3 hours of exhausted & loud screaming: “HELP HERE! WE ARE
TRAPPED WITH 4 DOGS!!! WE HAVE NOTHING TO EAT! NO ELECTRICITY!” - [
no electricity inside the house and outside in the street!!!] We
waited so long the relief for two fundamental facts: 1) in the area
was in emergency also an Hospital and an Home for the elderly to
evacuate... 2) our house is hidden from the main street, that's why
nobody was able to understand where to find a way to reach the place.

Anyway
just in time – at evening - before the deep night came down - 2
Fireman (from another little village) – that were in town for a
casual combination – with a basic track (without the big staircase)
got the call of emergency and they came right there to give us  some
help! Immediately the situation appeared critical & very
dangerous for ALL of us! Fireman ordered us to EVACUATE
INSTANTLY!!!


The
2 Fireman came inside walking some steps of the front yard completely
full of water and mud (approximately 1mt & 20 cm)! 


They
tried once at the main door but the water pressure and things inside
were blocking the entrance... 


Then
they tried on the secondary door that was a bit more free from
obstacles.... after few assessment to find the right way of
escape.... the only one was to came down from the first floor and
going inside the water/mud that was flooded in at 1mt & 20 cm
also INSIDE the HOUSE in ALL rooms at ground floor.... 


A
bit of perplexity mixed up to fear, despair and a sense of loss...
thinking to put just one feet on that water was disturbing.... but
was our only possibility..... then we prepared – with very few
things you can bring in the darkness, also things that you don't need
but in that moment your mind it's in SHOCK and is missing some logic
functions to stay focused – anyway we were ready to go down from
the stairs with 2 dogs at a time in arms with the fireman ahead of us
to guide in that mess: my mom with Theo & Buffy with me inside a
summer bag. (other 2 dogs - Mapo & Ariel - has been recovered
just some moment after in the same way!) 


We
succeeded to keep them safe & dry for what was possible, but they
didn't touched that “kind of water”, conversely to us that we
owed to soak up at waist!!! 


After
that in a SHOCKED state of mind and completely dirty and wet, we run
away with the 4 dogs in the car (that miraculously has been safe up
in the parking!!!)  to our relatives that in emergency give us
hospitality for 2 days on a sofa and few days a stall for dogs.



THE
DAY AFTER: A long day of strange feelings and working on

The
day after started very early in a state of bad feelings – as you
can imagine I didn't slept so well that night!!! 


We
came at “WHAT” 24 hours before was still my house, and the “show”
was really, really miserable, a feeling of impotence in front of all
that mud, water that got the lower level but still there! Walking
over it was like wet quicksand!  - Horrible thing! 


We
worked a lot for all the day long to put away the the things and
trying to draw the water with pumps with the HELP of Hundreds of
Teenagers that offered their help, time and smile to us and in the
whole area hit by the flood! Since the beginning their presence
has been so efficient and important, so significant that after they
has been called “Angeli del fango” (Mud's Angels!) 


We
worked so hard I the first place of the 2 weeks after the disaster
and then has been decided to put in safety the whole house making a
significant restructuring that is still on the working progress right
now after 3 months and a half! 


______________________________________________________Dogshouse

An
important note about the last 3 months  - while we were managing
other kind of problems - our dogs has be gently recovered at the City
Hall Dog House “Lilli & Vagabondo”. In
such a situation our Dogs has been through; changing their habits
from the warmth of a sofa or rug to a less comfortable
fence kennel but a GOOD shelter ; 
their stay and our concern, has been warmed up to the very nice and
professional staff of AVALON Association and the volunteers that make
their job and spent their time with true dedication; Love &
Passion for Dogs and Animals in general.

Charity
for the Dogs

In
favor of the Doghouse/AVALON  we will save the 10% of each donations
– starting from the contribution of 50€ - with the amount  we
will buy food, kennels, etc for so many other worthy Dogs less
fortunate as mine!!!

Why
YOUR help can make a difference!

All
the above report-story to explain you why we are raising money: As
you can imagine, an house totally flooded, once it will be restored needs again a lot
of things inside and out to be cozy, comfortable, warm & familiar
again.  Now we are living in a temporary house not so far - together with our Dogs that came back from the doghouse! - with
some primary furniture to live in – as table, bed, refrigerator etc
- that generous people donate us, but it's a really TEMORARY
accommodation.

Once we will come back to the “116th House” some furniture inevitably will be missed! That's why we need your precious help that means a lot to us! Refurnish a full house it's a too strong effort for our limited income and any kind of donation can make a significant REBORN for us! For any question, feel free to contact! We thank-you an advance for your time reading our story! Remember that if you cannot make a donation, you can spread to the world and share this project with your friends and loved ones that may be interested!THANK YOU SO MUCH!                                                                                                   --------VERSIONE in ITALIANO ------
Aiutaci a rendere la nostra casa accogliente, confortevole e di nuovo familiare.

Quello
che è successo:


13
ottobre 2014


E'
stato un Lunedi con un forte temporale.


Erano
un paio di giorni di intensa pioggia intorno l'area estesa tra le 3
regioni del Nord-Ovest d'Italia (Liguria-Toscana e Emilia Romagna)


Quel
pomeriggio qualcosa è andato storto.


Il
piccolo torrente ""Baganza"" - affluente di quello principale
- con lo stesso nome della città: ""Parma"" – era in piena
eccezionale  fin dall'inizio della giornata, su  in montagna,  ha
portato  via l'installazione della piscina di Berceto.


E'
stato un mix di acqua, detriti, fango, tutto ciò che poteva portare
via altre alle fogne naturalmente.


16:15
- L'inizio di una situazione pericolosa


Io
e mia mamma (più i nostri 4 cani) eravamo all'interno della casa
durante il temporale, come al solito durante una tempesta.


A
un certo punto viene a mancare la corrente.


Questo
ci mette in allarme, quindi decidiamo di andare fuori e verificare se
ad altri nel vicinato mancava la corrente.


In
un primo momento abbiamo solo sentito un forte rumore d'acqua - il
traffico era completamente in tilt - ma abbiamo voluto assicurarci
che non fosse il fiume principale ""Parma"" in piena; infatti
non era da lì il problema (anche se il livello dell'acqua era al
massimo); il vero pericolo proveniva dall'altro lato del ""Baganza"",
che traboccava innondando strade, parchi, marciapiedi, garage e la
mia CASA !!!


ABBIAMO
VISTO LA MORTE IN FACCIA!


Eravamo
appena fuori casa quando abbiamo visto arrivare l'acqua di un colore
grigio venire nella nostra direzione e nello stesso tempo i tombini
che sgorgavano come una fontana!


Ho
avuto pochi secondi per realizzare quello che stava succedendo e
correre verso casa e mettere i nostri 4 cani al sicuro.


In
quel momento la prima cosa a cui ho pensato è stato quello di
rimanere in vita!
Correvamo
così veloce con l'acqua grigia (velocissima) alle calcagna!


Non
so come ho trovato la chiave giusta per aprire la porta, ma l'acqua
ha iniziato ad entrare anche all'interno della casa attraverso la
fessura sotto la porta, finestre, muri.


Sento
il gorgogliare dell'acqua ....


Ho
gridato a mia madre: ""porta i cani al primo piano!” 
(unico piano disponibile)


Siamo
fuggite al primo piano. 



Solo
una camera e un balcone che si affaccia sul cortile di fronte dove
abbiamo visto l'acqua invadere tutto quanto: ombrellone, tavolo,
sedie, panchina, cuccia del cane, armadio degli attrezzi.....TUTTO!




Lo
stesso ""scenario"" accadeva all'interno con tutte le cose,
gli utensili, mobili, vestiti, scarpe, cibo, documenti, libri,
fotografie e  ricordi ....


In
un batter d'occhio ..... la nostra vita è stata spazzato via!


05:30
- 1 ora di acqua – Un disastro!
Abbiamo
trascorso il resto del pomeriggio - fino alle 8 di sera - sul balcone
gridando aiuto !!! - Il rumore dell'acqua era assordante e copriva le
voci!!!


Le
linee telefoniche erano totalmente fuori uso, perché nella zona dell'innondazione è presente la centrale delle telecomunicazioni, che è
stata completamente sommersa.


Eravamo
davvero disperate!


08:00
- 2 Vigili del Fuoco come 2 Angeli
Dopo 3 ore disperate e sfinite urlando: ""aiuto qui! Siamo intrappolati CON 4 CANI !!! Non abbiamo niente da mangiare! Niente elettricità! ""- [Senza elettricità all'interno della casa e fuori in strada!!!]

I
vigili del fuoco ci ha ordinato di evacuare l'abitazione
IMMEDIATAMENTE!!!


Un

pieno di acqua e fango (circa 1mt e 20 cm)!


Hanno
provato ad aprire la porta principale, ma la pressione dell'acqua e le cose all'interno bloccavano l'ingresso … Poi hanno provato sulla
porta secondaria, che era più libera da ostacoli... dopo qualche
valutazione per trovare il modo migliore per evacuare da casa;  l'unica

<p>-how much the refill material cost?</p>
<p>For additive materials (we suggest PLA), you'll be able to use your own. No proprietary cartridge check is in place</p>
<p>-What are your plans for servicing the printers if they become faulty or require a tune up?</p>
<p>We mostly foresee  jammed extruders or damaged milling motors for tool crashes etc.<br/>Since these parts are mounted in the dual head carriage, We'll send a new dual head for the costumer to easily replace himself, upon retrieval of the faulty/failed unit.</p>
<p>Fine tuning consist in semi-automated (computer assisted) Plane leveling and occasional belt tensioning.<br/></p>
<p>While the other components are pretty strong, we'll give any assistance needed, included repairing the unit at our expenses within 2 years of the purchase.<br/></p>
<p>-What file formats can I use to print from?</p>
<p>FABtotum uses standard Gcode, therefore any software that can create a toolpath in Gcode is valid.This means you can use any software you like to print from STL files, 3ds Obj or similar.</p>
<p>-Do I need to import the machining/printing file into dedicated printing software?<br/>FABtotum is controlled by a web interface over Wifi or Ethernet cable, therefore you can use commonly used open source software as Printrun by Kliment, Cura or equivalents to prepare the print and run them.<br/>More details will  be unveiled after we fix the specifications of FABtotum's Web interface.<br/></p>
<p>-What software will be available for FABtotum?</p>
<p>We are focusing on delivering a good machining platform,therefore our initial software will be pretty basic.<br/>FAbtotum will have a computer assisted printing-plane leveling procedure running with a small application you should use before printing, for best results.<br/>For scanning or Z-level probing a simple command line automated script will generate the point cloud in a separate file.<br/>Both will be available as binaries too, for developers to expand upon.<br/></p>
<p>-What software will I use for scanning objects?</p>
<p>We'll most likely create a small batch application for probing,laser scanning.<br/>Output will be a point cloud you can easily convert and correct in freeware software.</p>
<p><i>-you are using a bowden extruder. I heard it gives worst results(?</i>)<br/>bowden extruders consist of a feeder motor separated from the moving head.<br/>while it's true they are less responsive to retraction and can suffer from oozing, a good tuned bowden extruder can produce quality prints [see: Ultimaker].<br/>On top of that, without the heavy Nema 17 motor (it weights approx 1kg) the machine can do rapid movements and accelerate quickly, avoiding stringing during the print of gaps. If you would like to add a multi colored direct drive printing extruder, you can do so , removing the dual head and using the space to mount it.<br/></p>
<i>-What do I Have to do with Coupons?</i><br/><br/>You can redeem them in our shop (soon to be open on fabtotum.com).<br/>It’s a personal, single-use code. We suggest you to save it or print it and keep it somewhere safe.<br/>Once redeemed the coupon expires.<br/><i><br/>-Can I preorder FABtotum?</i><br/><br/>All backers (except who already got a FABtotum Ready-to-go package or Fabtotum Kit) will receive a email to place a order before the store opens.<br/><br/>The shipping order will be based on the backer contribution date. If you backed this project early you can place your order as late as possible (preorder windows) and still be in the front line before non-backers!<br/><i>FABtotum kits, FABtotum ready-to-go packages will have priority over coupons.<br/><br/>-I‘m not a backer, When I’ll be able to place a preorder?</i><br/><br/>Assuming the campaign is successful, you’ll have to wait the store to be opened. Please also note that backers will have priority shipping over any other order.<br/><br/><i>-I’m a backer, what happens if I miss the preorder window?</i><br/><br/>You’ll still be able to purchase FABtotum, but  you will lose the opportunity to receive it early than non-backers. In fact, you will still be able to redeem your coupon code before it expires.<br/><br/><i>-I’m a backer. Will FABtotum price change after the campaign?</i><br/><br/>If you are a backer you’ll be able to preorder at this same pricing before the shop opens.<br/>After that, only coupon codes will grant the same pricing (until they expires).<br/><br/><i>-Will prices change after the campaign?</i><br/><br/>Good question! We hope to bring FABtotum at the lower price possible as we demonstrated in this campaign, We will, however ,be facing fixed costs during production such as rent,machinery,personnel.<br/>Mantaining this pricing policy depends on how those costs will compare with sales.<br/><br/><i>-Do you accept external donations?</i><br/><br/>We are currently NOT collecting any kind of donation anywhere else.<br/><br/><i>-What I’m getting in the consumer version of FABtotum?</i><br/><br/>Please refer to the Award description and the ""the Prototype &amp; the Future"" paragraph for an overview of the consumer version improvements over the prototype shown.<br/><br/><br/></span></span></span></span><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Missed the campaign?
FABtotum PRISM is on Indiegogo: the future of Personal Fabrication is here!







FABtotum is a multipurpose tool, World's first Low Cost Desktop Personal Fabrication device that can operate a wide range of Computer controlled (CNC) manufacturing and 3d-scanning processes.Print, Cut, Mill, Scan, Manipulate. Rinse and repeat!A seamless interaction between the physical and the digital world.While Current 3D printers are defined as Personal fabricators, there is so much more to personal fabrication than 3d printing alone! FABtotum allows anyone to explore the endless possibilities of a multipurpose fabrication device.FABtotum is capable of 3d printing objects with the FFF technique (Fused Filament Fabrication) like most low cost 3D-printers around.Exploring design and shape possibilities has never been cheaper  and faster.The high speed PLA/ABS printing is the best way to go for a quick design prototype, and with a Z precision up to 0,47 microns, a polished sample prototype is possible too. Motion bearings and a new belt driving mechanism allows a smooth and fast print.Build area volume is very high (up to 210x240x240mm), as high as 24% Print-to-Printer Size ratio (FABtotum enclosure is a small 36cm cube!)  Automated Z axis leveling check assist the user in leveling the printing surface. Removing the prints is as easy as it gets, thanks to the removable printing plane.Thanks to the built-in heated bed prints will proceed smoothly and objects will have higher quality! No need for sticking duck tape or use sticky solutions.The glass build platform is easy to clean and won't be full of scratches after a week like common polymer-based surfaces seen in other 3d printers.Sometimes 3D printing is not enough.Fabtotum features a dual head, with an engraving/milling spindle motor that can be used to accomplish a wide range of machine operations on many common materials including wood, light aluminium or brass alloys.Thanks to a sturdy structure and unconventional tecnical solutions FABtotum is capable of subtractive machining without compromising 3d printing volumes or printing speeds.Switching to subtractive mode is easy: just remove and tilt the double sided printing plane and expose the milling plane with built in fixtures to secure your workpiece.Along with 3/4 Axis Subtractive Machining, Fabtotum is capable of 3-axis hybrid Additive / Subtractive manufacturing, meaning you can work in dual mode without loosing the position or having to move the workpiece.

FABtotum is capable of scanning solid objects thanks to a built in laser scanner (quick scan, medium quality) and one dimension (Z) touch probe digitalizer (hi-accuracy, very slow).Using this feature you'll be able to unlock a whole lot of potential: scan and print duplicates of solid objects, create new objects with foams or modeling clay and scan them for further editing in a modeling software of choice, or print them in additive mode or cut/mill in subtractive mode.Most 3d scanners cannot acquire small objects (such as a coin) and a physical digitalizer cannot acquire complex objects without at least 4 axis of freedom.FABtotum can do both and much more.
Scanning
 objects means you'll never run out of stuff to print, you'll be able to
 experiment with shapes or reverse-engineer objects around you, scanning
 and then duplicating a modified version! You'll be able to freely print your scanned objects in any other 3D printer or FABtotum Personal Fabricator, without restrictions or DRM check of any kind.

FABtotum is capable of printing not only without being connected to a computer, but 
from cabled LAN, Wireless LAN and remotely from the Internet. Also, 
users and developers will have access to a well known development ecosystem, the Raspberry pi's Raspbian linux distribution to develop more applications.Fabtotum will feature a customized web management , SSH and VNC server on the
 local network, so anyone with your authorization code can access all 
the functions of the machine: 3d Printing, 3d scanning, Milling, 
Diagnostics, or maybe watch a stream of the onboard camera during a 
print.

All those function will be accessible not only from anywhere 
in your local network, but also on any device capable of browsing the 
web. Enjoy the pleasure of printing remotely from a smartphone,a tablet,your windows Pc, Mac, Linux, Android, IOS.Touch interface, mouse , keyboard, you choose!


[the above is an artist rendition]

Fabtotum is open to personalization: thanks to the overall structure and the detachable  head, Fabtotum can accommodate another subtractive or additive head on top, such as a more powerful motor, a small laser diode module for paper cutting, a pick and place clamp or a syringe for scientific applications. a multi-color printing head. FABtotum could be even used for complex coil winding.Laser-cut parts, mill a double sided PCB or even do some 4-axis plasma cutting…and more! it’s up to you to experiment!Use all those techniques together  and you’ll get the best out of  FABtotum.FABtotum will be available in various colors, to fit perfectly in your studio,home, lab or office. FABtotum is a small  36,6 cm cube, meaning it won't occupy all your desk.All the printing material is stored inside the machine,leaving your desk free of filament coils.

The Fabtotum device is meant to push the boundaries of personal fabrication. To do this we want to involve people in the design process as much as possible, and allow them to modify and improve the machine to fit their own needs without needless restrictions. We will allow the design and commercialization of third party ""heads"" to expand the machine capabilities.FABtotum technologies have been secured by a pending patent from the threat of lawsuit for patent infringement. The full documentations,drawings and the reproduction of FABtotum is allowed and encouraged under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Sharealike 3.0 Unported Licence.    
Assembled, Kit or DIY? You decide. 
Full Schematics and instructions available online.
Easily customizable, Easy to assemble.
Powered by a RAspberry Pi Mod B +  Arduino ™  Derivate/Compatible Open Source Physical Computing Platform.
Uses industry standards and Open Source software.
Third party heads or parts can be built and sold freely to fit on FABtotum.

Please also note that tossing  source files and schematics around the web is, to us, not enough to reach the goals of open source development. Forums and the Dev blog will host discussions on how to move forward development.We also hope to build a public repository for additive, subtractive and scanned objects/projects.“To teach that a comparatively few men are responsible for the greatest forward steps of mankind is the worst sort of nonsense.”― Henry FordFabtotum allows low cost personal fabrication without compromises.Finding the right conditions where you can have both decent subtractive and additive manufacturing in one small envelope is no easy task. we think we reached a good compromise between speed precision and strength thanks to unconventional movement transmission methods and structural solutions.
Fabtotum has been developed to be built from the ground up from industrial-grade components, cheaper to get in quantity and more reliable than ever.Because of that, FABtotum is made to sustain way more punishment than you can possibly cause without hurting yourself.

Please note that our development process hasn't stopped yet, will be heavily influenced by the outcome of this campaign and as a result some of these specifications may change slightly. Our commitment is to provide the best compromise between speed,precision and functionality.FABtotum is a young Italian startup, currently hosted at the Business incubator district ""POLIHUB"" of the University of Politecnico di Milano, one of the most renowned  european universities in Engineering, Architecture, Industrial Design since 1863.In April 2013 FABtotum won the S2P competition held by the Politecnico Foundation, and the company is currently undergoing evaluation to become a university Spin-off, allowing access to academic expertise, R&D facilities and more. As August 2013 we hold rights on the FABtotum trademark for commercial use, a patent covering multiple technical solutions for the FABtotum Multipurpose Desktop Personal Fabricator is currently pending for publication.We'll be attending the first European Maker Faire in Rome, October 3-6, 2013.Our development team is composed by Marco Rizzuto, 28 and Giovanni Grieco, 28 both with a background in Architecture and a passion for design, innovation and personal fabrication. Fabtotum is the result of several years of CNC designing experience for personal use. FABtotum is our dream-machine as makers as well the result of a passion we hope everyone will appreciate and share.

Indiegogo community has been supportive to many inspiring projects, making them a success and a reality.Unlike many big campaigns we don't have an established company behind with huge funds to invest, we are a young start-up company with limited funds.However FABtotum has been designed from the ground up to be really cheap to produce and assemble, and serial production will lower the price further.For this reason we hope to build momentum with this campaign, demonstrating that the market is ready for this kind of devices. A crowdfunding campaign is for us a good starting point because it will act as a reality check for us, will demonstrate the potential of this technology, and will spread the word about Fabtotum, allowing us to gather resources and build a small community around it.We also believe in the future of personal fabrication as an inspiration for an international, open and cooperative society. As an Open Source project, FABtotum needs the help of the very people that can understand the consequences of technologically-improved social cooperation, just like any crowdfunding supporter.Funds will be used to start-up the production process and R&D for product and production engineering, allowing us to ship FABtotum in approximately 8 months.      
As with all crowdfunding campaigns there are risks and challenges.Delivering a complex product is not easy task and FABtotum while not very complex, requires a good level of engineering and system integration, both software and hardware.Some of the components are currently being hold in the Beta design phase to verify what tools and monetary resources we'll be able to deploy.We think we have a solid project, we demonstrated it with our prototype. From a software standpoint we'll leave any option open to developers to improve or entirely change the derived firmware and the onboard OS.At the moment FABtotum runs on a modified RepRap-flavored firmware, controlled by serial connection by a Raspberry Pi board.Our second challenge will be  to successfully organize the supply line, from a good number of suppliers.Finally we'll succeed in scaling the production up (after delivering to our backers) only if we'll be able to increase our team size.Known risks are:Higher production prices due to few units sold, increasing the number of components we have to preorder, reducing our resources. System integrations (especially software/electronics) might require more time than expected.

We built a prototype to demonstrate  our capabilities and commitment to the project.As a result you have seen footage from a working prototype that has (and still is) constantly being tested.The final version will be pretty much indistinguishable from the Prototype, so what you saw is a fair representation of the FABtotum consumer version you'll get.As for the future, we are working on improving the consumer version further:
We are working to improve the printing area further (up to 27%).
The cover lid will have a sliding mechanism for easier access to the working area.
Z Axis Leadscrew and linear bearings will probably be covered to avoid dust and dirt and dust from getting in.This part is currently “naked” in the prototype.
The Prototype requires the operator to switch the tilting dual head to go from additive to subtractive and back, while the final version features a fixed  dual head that requires no user intervention to switch and allows for 3-axis hybrid Additive / Subtractive manufacturing.
User intervention is needed only to engage the A axis (4th Axis) if needed for subtractive works.Engaging the 4th axis disable the extruder, as both shares the same motor.
The head mount has more space for mounting even bigger tools (possibly up to 65mm).
Electronics will be an Arduino ™ Derivate instead of a Mega Board, running standard (albeit modified) open source 3d-Printer firmware (such as Sprinter, Marlin).You may change or modify the firmware anytime as you like, or use our version.


-how much the refill material cost?
For additive materials (we suggest PLA), you'll be able to use your own. No proprietary cartridge check is in place
-What are your plans for servicing the printers if they become faulty or require a tune up?
We mostly foresee  jammed extruders or damaged milling motors for tool crashes etc.Since these parts are mounted in the dual head carriage, We'll send a new dual head for the costumer to easily replace himself, upon retrieval of the faulty/failed unit.
Fine tuning consist in semi-automated (computer assisted) Plane leveling and occasional belt tensioning.
While the other components are pretty strong, we'll give any assistance needed, included repairing the unit at our expenses within 2 years of the purchase.
-What file formats can I use to print from?
FABtotum uses standard Gcode, therefore any software that can create a toolpath in Gcode is valid.This means you can use any software you like to print from STL files, 3ds Obj or similar.
-Do I need to import the machining/printing file into dedicated printing software?FABtotum is controlled by a web interface over Wifi or Ethernet cable, therefore you can use commonly used open source software as Printrun by Kliment, Cura or equivalents to prepare the print and run them.More details will  be unveiled after we fix the specifications of FABtotum's Web interface.
-What software will be available for FABtotum?
We are focusing on delivering a good machining platform,therefore our initial software will be pretty basic.FAbtotum will have a computer assisted printing-plane leveling procedure running with a small application you should use before printing, for best results.For scanning or Z-level probing a simple command line automated script will generate the point cloud in a separate file.Both will be available as binaries too, for developers to expand upon.
-What software will I use for scanning objects?
We'll most likely create a small batch application for probing,laser scanning.Output will be a point cloud you can easily convert and correct in freeware software.
-you are using a bowden extruder. I heard it gives worst results(?)bowden extruders consist of a feeder motor separated from the moving head.while it's true they are less responsive to retraction and can suffer from oozing, a good tuned bowden extruder can produce quality prints [see: Ultimaker].On top of that, without the heavy Nema 17 motor (it weights approx 1kg) the machine can do rapid movements and accelerate quickly, avoiding stringing during the print of gaps. If you would like to add a multi colored direct drive printing extruder, you can do so , removing the dual head and using the space to mount it.
-What do I Have to do with Coupons?You can redeem them in our shop (soon to be open on fabtotum.com).It’s a personal, single-use code. We suggest you to save it or print it and keep it somewhere safe.Once redeemed the coupon expires.-Can I preorder FABtotum?All backers (except who already got a FABtotum Ready-to-go package or Fabtotum Kit) will receive a email to place a order before the store opens.The shipping order will be based on the backer contribution date. If you backed this project early you can place your order as late as possible (preorder windows) and still be in the front line before non-backers!FABtotum kits, FABtotum ready-to-go packages will have priority over coupons.-I‘m not a backer, When I’ll be able to place a preorder?Assuming the campaign is successful, you’ll have to wait the store to be opened. Please also note that backers will have priority shipping over any other order.-I’m a backer, what happens if I miss the preorder window?You’ll still be able to purchase FABtotum, but  you will lose the opportunity to receive it early than non-backers. In fact, you will still be able to redeem your coupon code before it expires.-I’m a backer. Will FABtotum price change after the campaign?If you are a backer you’ll be able to preorder at this same pricing before the shop opens.After that, only coupon codes will grant the same pricing (until they expires).-Will prices change after the campaign?Good question! We hope to bring FABtotum at the lower price possible as we demonstrated in this campaign, We will, however ,be facing fixed costs during production such as rent,machinery,personnel.Mantaining this pricing policy depends on how those costs will compare with sales.-Do you accept external donations?We are currently NOT collecting any kind of donation anywhere else.-What I’m getting in the consumer version of FABtotum?Please refer to the Award description and the ""the Prototype & the Future"" paragraph for an overview of the consumer version improvements over the prototype shown.",48.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone. I'm Derek Keepers, Founder and Chief Swapper at SwapServe. SwapServe is a website where people can sign up to volunteer with local non-profits and get free stuff from local businesses as a thank you. I started this company literally at my kitchen table, which you can see in our video. I'm a high school teacher by day and the leader of the company on weekends, nights, lunch breaks, and every other free second I get. My partners include my wife Kelly, my brother Darren, and my friends Andrew, Jon, and Tosh.</p>
<p>We came up with the idea in February 2011 and since then have funded it entirely with personal loans, credit cards, and our own cash. We just found out that Kelly and I are going to have our first baby in March *YAY*. Needless to say, we need to do some saving. Your contribution will help us run SwapServe for the next six months. </p>
<p>The next six months are super crucial. We have completed 60 volunteer projects so far and have helped a lot of people. We expanded to Portland, Oregon, our first major city, in May and it's really catching on. From the beginning of July to the end of August, our number of registered volunteers nearly trippled! We're really picking up speed and if we keep going at the rate we're going, we'll be very close to covering the company's expenses with revenue from the site by May 2014.</p>
<p>Your backing will help us keep the doors open until SwapServe can pay for itself and go on to help millions of people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>None of us draw a salary from SwapServe. $3,900 will cover our basic monthly operating expenses for six months. Any extra funds we raise will go towards promotion or our monthly expenses beyond the next 6 months.</p>
<p>Since we started, this money has come out of my pocket. With your help, I'll be able to save for my kid during the next six months and keep SwapServe going.</p>
<p>We have a bunch of super awesome perks waiting for you. Check out the list to the right for more info on what you'll get as a thank you for your donation. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe that SwapServe really can change the world of volunteering. Non-profits always need good people to help do their work. We provide them with a super easy and free way to find all of the helping hands they need.</p>
<p>We're also out to prove to businesses that giving is a profitable advertising method. Each business that works with SwapServe not only donates free stuff to volunteers, but they actually pay to do it. This helps them show their community how much they care and it helps bring people through the door. It's good karma and good business!</p>
<p>Most of all, we want to make volunteering a part of life for as many people as possible. Sometimes a little extra incentive is what it takes to give someone that first glimpse into the world of giving back. Plus, we offer only short, 1-2 hour shifts of community service and no training is required. This means that even the busiest person can find time to give back because they can just sign up, show up for two hours, and go on about their day. With SwapServe, there is no big commitment for volunteers. You simply sign up, show up, and help. And of course, it's totally free for volunteers to use. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're passionate about our idea but can't commit financially, that's okay! The biggest way you can help us out is to like us on Facebook and share the posts that inspire you.

<p>Who knew there was so
much hope in hay? Basket weaving is more than tradition in Senegal; it’s a
practical necessity. For several decades, Senegalese women have refined this
traditional craft, capturing the eye of artists and designers from all corners
of the world. Their baskets incorporate local hays and grasses, and more
recently, strips of reclaimed plastic prayer
mats for color accents. The artistry is instantly recognizable, and each basket
is as unique as the woman weaving it. But until now, the bulk of profits sailed
far away from the towns where they were needed most. Enter <a href=""http://www.jjangde.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jjangde</a>. <b>By encouraging conscious shopping, we

Our
vision of a self-sustaining, scalable model began with one village in Senegal,
West Africa. From here we saw that this idea had the potential to grow and
serve multiple communities in need. The model is simple: local, hand-made
goods employ local entrepreneurs, <a href=""http://www.jjangde.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jjangde</a> connects the handmade goods from rural
communities to global markets, and profits go to fund schools in the
communities where the goods were made. As the schools succeed, we hope to grow
across communities, countries, and even cultures. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>With a </b></span><b>governing <a href=""http://jjangde.com/mission-impact/meet-the-team/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">board of women</a> from Senegal and <a href=""http://jjangde.com/2013/08/03/ousmane-gaye-founder/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ousmane Gaye,</a> Jjangde's COO and Founder, our programs are managed and owned by the people in Senegal, West Africa. </b></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.jjangde.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jjangde</a> chain of sustainability starts with women. Senegalese
women have long supported families of nine (or more) on a single dollar a day. Yet,
in spite of the highly coveted goods created in this tiny country, poverty and
lack of education greatly diminish a dollar’s reach. In the <a href=""http://www.jjangde.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jjangde</a> chain of sustainability, our “practically not-for-profit model” takes the
revenue generated by sales of these artisan goods and funnels them into a
cyclical employment model. Women will earn far higher wages and the power to
comfortably support their families. Plus, the additional monies will directly
fund schools in rural villages. </p>

<h2><b>How Jjangde baskets keep kids in the classroom</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p>
<p>Nearly 50% of rural
Senegalese children drop out of school before the age of 12, and a mere two
percent of girls attend high school. With the additional income from the 
Jjangde model, families can send their children to school rather than keep them on
family farms due to lack of resources. Because half of Senegalese adults
have never been to school, this process will also help to establish a culture
of formal education. Providing Senegalese children with the opportunity and
culture to stay in school remains key to opening up their futures to other
avenues and changing the prescribed expectations of low wages for
livelihood. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p>
<p>It turns out that
endurance in education starts with women, too. We have an agreement with all of
our artists that as long as they are employed by the <a href=""http://www.jjangde.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jjangde</a> cycle, they agree to keep their
children in school.  Not only that, but these baskets' profits, directed
back into the community, can fund full-time schooling for over 100 children for
an entire year.</p>

Who knew there was so
much hope in hay? Basket weaving is more than tradition in Senegal; it’s a
practical necessity. For several decades, Senegalese women have refined this
traditional craft, capturing the eye of artists and designers from all corners
of the world. Their baskets incorporate local hays and grasses, and more
recently, strips of reclaimed plastic prayer
mats for color accents. The artistry is instantly recognizable, and each basket
is as unique as the woman weaving it. But until now, the bulk of profits sailed
far away from the towns where they were needed most. Enter Jjangde. By encouraging conscious shopping, we
created a cycle of employment designed to keep resources in the communities
they come from and help give children the opportunities they deserve through
education. Yeah, we think it’s pretty cool, too.










How
it works: one community at a time 

Our
vision of a self-sustaining, scalable model began with one village in Senegal,
West Africa. From here we saw that this idea had the potential to grow and
serve multiple communities in need. The model is simple: local, hand-made
goods employ local entrepreneurs, Jjangde connects the handmade goods from rural
communities to global markets, and profits go to fund schools in the
communities where the goods were made. As the schools succeed, we hope to grow
across communities, countries, and even cultures. With a governing board of women from Senegal and Ousmane Gaye, Jjangde's COO and Founder, our programs are managed and owned by the people in Senegal, West Africa. 





Empowering women


The Jjangde chain of sustainability starts with women. Senegalese
women have long supported families of nine (or more) on a single dollar a day. Yet,
in spite of the highly coveted goods created in this tiny country, poverty and
lack of education greatly diminish a dollar’s reach. In the Jjangde chain of sustainability, our “practically not-for-profit model” takes the
revenue generated by sales of these artisan goods and funnels them into a
cyclical employment model. Women will earn far higher wages and the power to
comfortably support their families. Plus, the additional monies will directly
fund schools in rural villages. 












How Jjangde baskets keep kids in the classroom



Nearly 50% of rural
Senegalese children drop out of school before the age of 12, and a mere two
percent of girls attend high school. With the additional income from the 
Jjangde model, families can send their children to school rather than keep them on
family farms due to lack of resources. Because half of Senegalese adults
have never been to school, this process will also help to establish a culture
of formal education. Providing Senegalese children with the opportunity and
culture to stay in school remains key to opening up their futures to other
avenues and changing the prescribed expectations of low wages for
livelihood.  



It turns out that
endurance in education starts with women, too. We have an agreement with all of
our artists that as long as they are employed by the Jjangde cycle, they agree to keep their
children in school.  Not only that, but these baskets' profits, directed
back into the community, can fund full-time schooling for over 100 children for
an entire year.












What your purchase will do

When you purchase a
basket through this campaign (using the reward structure on the right), the
money funnels directly into the Jjangde cycle of employment. We are using IndieGoGo as a jumpstart for a process that
is already in action. With a test run of baskets, we were able to fund a summer
program that gave 300 students extra support for the upcoming school year. We
also fully funded one year of school for 110 students. Not only that, but we developed
an exchange program to strengthen the relationship between high schools in
Senegal and the United States. 
Now we need your
help. 
If we can raise
$50,000, Jjangde would be able to move into a full year’s worth of production. We would have the
capacity to hire 10 women full-time, open at least two schools, and bring an
inventory of 5,000 baskets to the states. 
$100,000 would cover
administrative costs stateside and increase the reach and impact of our design.
In just one year, we could employ 20 women full-time, open several schools, and
educate hundreds of  children with our
sustainable community-based model.
In short, by
shopping here with your heart, you will:

Provide more girls the opportunity
     to go to school
Help break the cycle of poverty
Fund community-based schools
Employ women and improve
     conditions not only for individual families, but for whole communities

The following points are some hard facts about this business in the despicable violation of human rights.   
DID YOU KNOW?
Flagged in 2008 by INTERPOL (The International Criminal Police Organization), Costa Rica is fast rising as the hemispheric capital of sex tourism.
Until June of 2012, Costa Rica was considered a ""Tier 3"" country on the United States Human Trafficking Watch List. (It is now a ""Tier 2"")


This change reflects ongoing efforts in Costa Rica to educate and fight against the trafficking of humans, but does not negate the fact that everyday in Costa Rica children are still sold for sex, and in very visible places.

The average age a teen enters the sex trade is 12 to 14-year-old. 
According to the U.S. State Department, 600,000 to 800,000 people are trafficked across international borders every year. More than 70 percent are female and half are children.
Human trafficking is the third largest international crime industry (behind illegal drugs and arms trafficking).

It reportedly generates a profit of $32 billion every year. Of that number, $15.5 billion is made in industrialized countries.

<p>We
know there is an overwhelming amount of choices when it comes to
organizations doing humanitarian work in developing countries! Please
support Slum Doctor Programme, a non-profit that truly works with
local people, in  sustainable ways to alleviate HIV/AIDS at the grassroots level. Read on for more
detailed information about our specific projects!</p>
<p><strong><b>Short
Summary: </b></strong>Slum
Doctor Programme (SDP) is a certified 501(c)3 non-profit, based out
of Bellingham, Washington. Slum Doctor Programme (SDP) partners
directly with local community based organizations in Uganda and Kenya
to continue  the fight against HIV/AIDS. SDP
believes strongly in sustainable methods of development, and
emphasizes the importance of connecting local community based
organizations within East Africa to each other. Recently SDP has been
lucky enough to employ Shilla Adyero from Gulu, Uganda as a full time
staff member in Bellingham Washington!
SDP
is about ordinary people and communities coming together to create
solutions to one of the world’s most pressing healthcare concerns,
HIV/AIDS. SDP believes that a respectful and reciprocal relationship
with our African partners is key to successful community development
and social change.

<p>
</p>
<p>Majority
of our HIV/AIDS outreach is directed towards two of SDP's partner
organizations: HIV/AIDS Support Network Namatala (<b>HASNN</b>), and Busoga
Shining Light Association (<b>BSLA</b>). It is our goal in the coming year
for these two organizations to create a strong partnership in which
they can share their skills and capacity building with one another. 
</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">HIV/AIDS
Support Network Namatala is
composed of all local Namatala slum residents who are trained in HIV
counseling. Currently their services include: on the ground
counseling, free testing days, positive living support groups,
successful and growing savings groups, and an income generating
passion fruit garden project.

HASNN is currently the only organization providing HIV/AIDS related
services directly to the people of Namatala. The current board and
counselors involved in HASNN are extremely passionate, and are
working very hard towards moving their organization forward. Please

<p>Busoga
Shining Light Association: BSLA is a registered community based
organization located in Iganga, founded in 2002
 by two orphan brothers as an HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention
program. A survey conducted by BSLA revealed that poverty and hunger
were the root causes of the prevailing HIV/AIDS scourge.
In the past decade BSLA has worked extremely hard at educating
farmers within the community on food security, and ways in which
yields of maize can be grown and sold at much fairer and efficient
prices. Today, the farmers within the these villages in Iganga, are
living much healthier and financially stable lives. However,  many
are still dealing with the devastating effects of HIV/AIDS. BSLA is
now quite an established organization and is ready to shift their
energy from strictly food production to HIV outreach and awareness!

people who live in poverty and lack access to education, basic health
services, nutrition and clean water. Young people and women are the
most vulnerable. Women are often powerless to insist on safe sex and
easily become infected by HIV positive partners. When people have
other diseases like sexually transmitted diseases, TB or malaria they
are also more likely to contract and die from AIDS.</p>
<p>
Although
AIDS has become very common it is still surrounded by silence. People
are ashamed to speak about being infected and many see it as a
scandal when it happens in their families. People living with AIDS
are exposed to daily prejudice born out of ignorance and fear.</p>
<p>
We
cannot tackle this epidemic unless we can break the silence and
remove the stigma [shame] that surrounds it. As leaders in our
communities we have to provide leadership on how to deal with
HIV/AIDS.

<p>
HIV/AIDS
has the power to reverse the gains we have made in our struggle to
build a better life for our people. Government cannot fight this
battle alone.</p>
<p>
Uganda
Government has providded health and welfare services, development
programmes and information. Organisations on the ground have to
provide the type of leadership and direction that will lead to real
change in people's attitudes and behaviour.</p>

know there is an overwhelming amount of choices when it comes to
organizations doing humanitarian work in developing countries! Please
support Slum Doctor Programme, a non-profit that truly works with
local people, in  sustainable ways to alleviate HIV/AIDS at the grassroots level. Read on for more
detailed information about our specific projects!
Short
Summary: Slum
Doctor Programme (SDP) is a certified 501(c)3 non-profit, based out
of Bellingham, Washington. Slum Doctor Programme (SDP) partners
directly with local community based organizations in Uganda and Kenya
to continue  the fight against HIV/AIDS. SDP
believes strongly in sustainable methods of development, and
emphasizes the importance of connecting local community based
organizations within East Africa to each other. Recently SDP has been
lucky enough to employ Shilla Adyero from Gulu, Uganda as a full time
staff member in Bellingham Washington!
SDP
is about ordinary people and communities coming together to create
solutions to one of the world’s most pressing healthcare concerns,
HIV/AIDS. SDP believes that a respectful and reciprocal relationship
with our African partners is key to successful community development
and social change. 



Meet
Some of Our Partners!


Majority
of our HIV/AIDS outreach is directed towards two of SDP's partner
organizations: HIV/AIDS Support Network Namatala (HASNN), and Busoga
Shining Light Association (BSLA). It is our goal in the coming year
for these two organizations to create a strong partnership in which
they can share their skills and capacity building with one another. 

HIV/AIDS
Support Network Namatala is
composed of all local Namatala slum residents who are trained in HIV
counseling. Currently their services include: on the ground
counseling, free testing days, positive living support groups,
successful and growing savings groups, and an income generating
passion fruit garden project.

HASNN is currently the only organization providing HIV/AIDS related
services directly to the people of Namatala. The current board and
counselors involved in HASNN are extremely passionate, and are
working very hard towards moving their organization forward. Please
check out their facebook page and take a minute to look at the
gallery tab to get a more personal connection to the true impact they
are having on the slum of Namatala.

Busoga
Shining Light Association: BSLA is a registered community based
organization located in Iganga, founded in 2002
 by two orphan brothers as an HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention
program. A survey conducted by BSLA revealed that poverty and hunger
were the root causes of the prevailing HIV/AIDS scourge.
In the past decade BSLA has worked extremely hard at educating
farmers within the community on food security, and ways in which
yields of maize can be grown and sold at much fairer and efficient
prices. Today, the farmers within the these villages in Iganga, are
living much healthier and financially stable lives. However,  many
are still dealing with the devastating effects of HIV/AIDS. BSLA is
now quite an established organization and is ready to shift their
energy from strictly food production to HIV outreach and awareness!

The
Impact:

HIV/AIDS
can affect anyone. But it is clear that it is spreading faster to
people who live in poverty and lack access to education, basic health
services, nutrition and clean water. Young people and women are the
most vulnerable. Women are often powerless to insist on safe sex and

other diseases like sexually transmitted diseases, TB or malaria they
are also more likely to contract and die from AIDS.

Although
AIDS has become very common it is still surrounded by silence. People
are ashamed to speak about being infected and many see it as a
scandal when it happens in their families. People living with AIDS
are exposed to daily prejudice born out of ignorance and fear.

We
cannot tackle this epidemic unless we can break the silence and
remove the stigma [shame] that surrounds it. As leaders in our
communities we have to provide leadership on how to deal with
HIV/AIDS. 


HIV/AIDS
has the power to reverse the gains we have made in our struggle to
build a better life for our people. Government cannot fight this
battle alone.

Uganda
Government has providded health and welfare services, development
programmes and information. Organisations on the ground have to
provide the type of leadership and direction that will lead to real
change in people's attitudes and behaviour.

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>SanSPEC aims to eliminate <strong>hospital acquired infections</strong> (HAI) and <strong>hand borne infections</strong> (HBI) by monitoring and tracking the hand sanitation process for Health Care, Food Manufacturing, Food Service and other professionals required to sanitize to mitigate the spread of HAI/HBI's.</p>
<h2><strong>Is your Health and Security Important?</strong></h2>
<p> <img alt=""Future of our family"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/971708/pictures/full/20130806074653-Cropped_De1.png?1375800418"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>How about your children, grand children, great grand children, loved ones, significant others, neighbors, friends?</strong></p>
<p>We are a group of professionals working to reduce the spread of HAI/HBI’s in hospitals, medical centers and food handling sites in the United States and around the world; however our goal is the detection of these killer germs by completing existing detection technology which will lead to eradication of HAI/HBI's in most cases. Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has been identified in 42 states as seen on NBC Nightly News. From the CDC, Some CRE bacteria have become resistant to almost all available antibiotics and can be deadly—one report cites they can contribute to death in up to 50% of patients who become infected. In the 42 states 11% of the hospital fatalities are caused by these pharmacologically resistant bacteria.</p>
<p>By these statements, help in solving this problem is needed urgently. It is difficult for the CDC to ask for the help as it can cause concern, even panic, within the public.</p>
<p>We have researched current offerings and created a solution that can greatly reduce the spread with a technological solution that reminds and tracks the process of <strong>hand sanitation</strong> which will greatly reduce hand borne contamination. The technology is available and we have a proven track record, the experience and skill sets to make this real. We will integrate detection sensor technology when reliable testing of pilot programs are completed.</p>
<p>After meeting with high level management at large health care facilities around the USA, the #1 show stopper to buying into and implementing a solution was that it needs to be reliable into the high 90% range. They have implemented currently available HAI/HBI prevention procedures and are looking to us to complete our solution to greatly enhance what they have begun.</p>
<p>The lawsuits from HAI/HBI's cost all of us, as these costs get passed on. What is the cost of loss of your life or a loved one’s life?</p>
<p>We have known that this was a possibility and now it is a reality. Where is the solution? Are you or your loved ones an acceptable loss? This is a war that needs to be won quickly! What is the economic impact when there is a 50% death rate due to infection in the general public?</p>
<p>It is a terrible situation when you or a loved one survives a simple or catastrophic illness only to lose a battle for life to a hand borne infection!</p>
<p>Our challenge is that we used our resources to identify the problem and began building the solution. The financial cost is greater than what we have available to complete testing and implementing the solution.</p>
<p>All donations are important to win this battle. If we can afford to purchase a Mega Million or Powerball lottery ticket for a chance to have a dream come true? Wouldn’t winning this lottery be a bigger dream come true?</p>
<p>We have been successful in all endeavors we were associated with to the level we were allowed to be successful at. This is too important to be held back from providing a reliable solution. There are other avenues to funding and they take incredible amounts of time and resources to get there. We believe we have a limited amount of time before the general public would begin to be infected, and that is not acceptable to us nor would it be to you!</p>
<p>We will provide progress reports via social media for all to see. The bigger the voice, the greater ability to have accountability! By donating, you are stating that providing the solution and displaying this information to the world, that the HAI/HBI issue is important to you and there is a need to solve it now!</p>
<p><strong>Our only deterrent will be if we do not meet our fund raising goal. If everyone gives something we can beat this together. This is about saving lives which is the ultimate Return on Investment (ROI)!</strong></p>
<p>9/11 happened because we didn’t have the technology, and the procedures weren’t in place. We didn’t listen to people who brought information to the attention of the powers that be.</p>
<p>The opportunity to curtail and reduce this threat is here now. We need your help in winning this battle!</p>
<p>This is about providing first responder, medical providers, and all of us a safe and secure environment to heal and survive in.</p>

<p><span>We began to see the ties that hunger, worthiness, &amp; poverty share... <strong>we began to see that ANY ONE of US are one decision, one pay-check, or one situation away from being on the street. </strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>We began to see that SOME individuals out there have homes, and STILL have a hard time finding food, </strong>so they do what they can to make sure their families can eat. Some of the saddest moments in our lives have been when we reach the end of the line and have to start turning people away because the food is gone.  </span></p>
<h3><span><strong>NOW, in order to resolve this we decided to open a non-profit breakfast &amp; lunch restaurant with set-donation pricing, and volunteer options for those who cannot afford to pay.  </strong></span></h3>
<p><span><strong>The ONe TRUe LOVe Kitchen will be a space where the food NEVER runs out, &amp; no one will ever be turned away.</strong></span></p>
<p>After reaching out to over 6,000 people in need since 2010, we see that the majority of people <strong>DO NOT</strong> want a hand-out... they want to contribute to their own success, and it is not often that they are given the space to do so. <strong>At the ONe TRUe LOVe Kitchen, empowerment is a side dish!</strong> We will make sure that everyone discovers his or her unique contribution, ultimately feeling like a part of the family.</p>

<p><span>We have 3 tiers of costs associated with the the pilot café...</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Basic Startup Cost: $10,000</strong></span><span> -The dollar amount we mention in the film represents this category. This covers initial product, beverage (coffee &amp; tea), &amp; some equipment cost.  This covers bare bones expenses, but it is enough to launch a full coffee &amp; tea bar.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Cloud 4.5 Startup Cost: $20,000</strong></span><span><strong> - </strong>Our IndieGoGo campaign reflects this amount! (<strong>PLUS IGG FEES</strong>)  This will cover all of the basic startup cost, a couple months of the recurring costs, beverage, AND beginning food cost. It also includes a point of sale system, 2 ipads, &amp; some basic aesthetic pieces that will allow us to give life to our new space.  We are pretty DYNAMIC individuals, and our Café will totally represent this!  This is enough to launch our coffee &amp; tea bar AND to introduce 6 menu items.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Cloud 9 Startup Cost: $30,000</strong></span><span> - Now THIS is the big beefy! This would include the bare-bones startup cost, the POS system, the computers, the aesthetic pieces, menu boards, a neon light, custom OTL retail merchandise, crew member uniforms, &amp; additional equipment that would allow our menu to grow.  </span></p>
<p>If our $20,000 goal is NOT met on IGG, we are implementing several supplemental strategies in order to insure our success.  This is going to happen regardless of the dollar amount raised- full-funding would just allow us to make an impact sooner!</p>

Eating & breathing are 2 fundamental needs that should be treated as basic human rights.  When a person experiences HUNGER on any level, it compromises aspects of the rest of his or her life.
At ONe TRUe LOVe, it is our mission to feed the heart, mind, & body of EVERY human being, with honor, integrity, & respect, REGARDLESS of one’s ability to afford it. 
We are Ann Cabano & Krysten Aldridge, the Co-Founders of ONe TRUe LOVe, and we would like to give YOU a little bit of history about why we do what we do!


 
 
 
 
 
 
We hit the streets of Phoenix almost 3 years ago with our hearts full of love and our coolers full of sandwiches.  We drove around in our grandma’s RV until we found people who seemed like they could use a hug, and maybe a bite to eat. 
 




 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This marked the beginning of our grass-roots outreach movement.  Within 3 months, we grew from a team of 8, to OVER 500 volunteers.

<p><em>As a parent, I’m horrified by yet another senseless killing of our children…now, gone far too soon.</em></p>
<p><em>As a philanthropist, I feel that I need to put aside my business needs and help these families in need of our support.</em></p>
<p><em>HelpJester has decided to ignore it’s current business goal and give HALF of future funds raised in this fundraiser to those affected by the horrendous attack in Newtown, CT.*</em></p>
<p><em>(*excluding American Red Cross and Pancreatic Cancer Action Network PERKS)</em></p>
<p><span>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<h3>Have we lost focus of what’s really important? <em>Can we do more? </em>Can we use today’s social media to make a life changing connection and help those in need? I believe we can...and we have in HelpJester!</h3>
<p>HelpJester.com is the World's First eMatching Social Network for People In Need. It is the eHarmony for People Helping People! The Make A Wish Foundation where <em>you</em> are the star. There are only a hand full of celebrities, but there are millions of people who can give of their time, their advice, their services or their fortunate financial well being. HelpJester is a vehicle to change the lives of all involved...in a very positive way.</p>
<h3>HelpJester Needs Your Help...</h3>
<p>HelpJester is a fully developed idea without the funds to move forward. Every day that goes by is another lost opportunity to connect the fortunate among us with those less fortunate. This is your chance to contribute to a cause for all causes...safe in the knowledge that 100% of the funds will be used to help millions in need.</p>
<p>This idea was born of my own adversity. My own devastating life challenges led me to the development of an idea that will change lives forever! It will change how we look at those in need and provide a non-judgmental community of people helping people.</p>
<p>Read more at HelpJester: The Birth of An Idea Through Adversity (helpjester.wordpress.com)</p>
<h3>My Commitment</h3>
<p>I so believe in the working practice of this concept that I've committed my life to seeing that it becomes available to all who seek to help or be helped. I'm a humble man with humble means. I've learned, over the years, the power and peace that comes with the gift of giving. Giving promotes healing in any and all ways. For the Helper as well as the Helpee. This is the ideal that HelpJester was founded on. This is just one way that makes HelpJester truly unique.</p>
<h3><strong>How does it work and what makes us different?</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Of the hundreds of successful fundraising sites online today, HelpJester is the <em>only</em> site that will electronically match those in need with someone who can help. Our eMatching capabilities and interconnecting social network creates a unique and personal experience that all other fundraising sites have overlooked.</p>
<p class=""p1"">HelpJester is a true Non-Profit organization. Most high profile organizations keep a substantial percentage of your donation for administrative fees and costs. HelpJester ensures that 100% of each giving member's gift goes directly to the individual or group making the request.</p>
<p class=""p2"">As a visitor of HelpJester.com, you will be encouraged to register for FREE and create a personal profile, tell your story and be matched with an individual, group or business who can help you in your time of need. There is no cost to becoming a member of our community!</p>
<p class=""p2"">Helpers will be asked to do the same, but instead of posting a request, they will be choosing a category in which they feel they can be the most helpful. They will then receive emails or messages, including a selection of individuals or groups with a request from their category. The Helper will then review these selections, find a story or individual that they feel a connection with and contact that person or group directly. It’s that simple!</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">HelpJester will also be host to <strong><em>“Featured Causes”</em></strong>. HelpJester will be the premier site for people helping people.</h3>
<p class=""p2"">A way for all to assist in large scale efforts of fund raising. A monthly or quarterly home page feature, designed to focus on a highlighted cause. Veterans, feeding the hungry or victims of a natural disaster such as the recent devistation caused by Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">HelpJester's Kid's Corner</h3>
<p>As HelpJester grows, we will be including a Kid's Corner for parents who would like to see their children experience, at an early age, the gift of giving and how empowering the experience of helping another human being can be. This is an opportunity to bring parents and children together in a worth while activity and create another generation of generosity.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Lemonade stands to help raise money for Hurricane Sandy victims, collecting clothes or toys that they could give to a family who's struggling over the holidays. There are many ways for children to get involved and experience the joy that comes with giving.</p>
<h3>Without the means to give financially? You can still help...</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to give financially, give of your time...to this fundraiser and later as a member of the HelpJester community. Right now, take a moment to share this fundraiser with everyone you know. The tools you need are provided right here on this site. This moment of your time will, ultimately, help in the creation of this concept and help millions in the process. Almost everyone can do something useful for others to strengthen the fabric of our shared humanity. The feeling you will experience for this unselfish act is the principle of this idea and is unmatched by riches and excess. Giving is a privilege. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Who We Are, What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>HelpJester.com is the World’s First eMatching Social Network for People In Need. </p>

As a philanthropist, I feel that I need to put aside my business needs and help these families in need of our support.
HelpJester has decided to ignore it’s current business goal and give HALF of future funds raised in this fundraiser to those affected by the horrendous attack in Newtown, CT.*

Have we lost focus of what’s really important? Can we do more? Can we use today’s social media to make a life changing connection and help those in need? I believe we can...and we have in HelpJester!
HelpJester.com is the World's First eMatching Social Network for People In Need. It is the eHarmony for People Helping People! The Make A Wish Foundation where you are the star. There are only a hand full of celebrities, but there are millions of people who can give of their time, their advice, their services or their fortunate financial well being. HelpJester is a vehicle to change the lives of all involved...in a very positive way.
HelpJester Needs Your Help...
HelpJester is a fully developed idea without the funds to move forward. Every day that goes by is another lost opportunity to connect the fortunate among us with those less fortunate. This is your chance to contribute to a cause for all causes...safe in the knowledge that 100% of the funds will be used to help millions in need.
This idea was born of my own adversity. My own devastating life challenges led me to the development of an idea that will change lives forever! It will change how we look at those in need and provide a non-judgmental community of people helping people.

My Commitment
I so believe in the working practice of this concept that I've committed my life to seeing that it becomes available to all who seek to help or be helped. I'm a humble man with humble means. I've learned, over the years, the power and peace that comes with the gift of giving. Giving promotes healing in any and all ways. For the Helper as well as the Helpee. This is the ideal that HelpJester was founded on. This is just one way that makes HelpJester truly unique.
How does it work and what makes us different?
Of the hundreds of successful fundraising sites online today, HelpJester is the only site that will electronically match those in need with someone who can help. Our eMatching capabilities and interconnecting social network creates a unique and personal experience that all other fundraising sites have overlooked.
HelpJester is a true Non-Profit organization. Most high profile organizations keep a substantial percentage of your donation for administrative fees and costs. HelpJester ensures that 100% of each giving member's gift goes directly to the individual or group making the request.
As a visitor of HelpJester.com, you will be encouraged to register for FREE and create a personal profile, tell your story and be matched with an individual, group or business who can help you in your time of need. There is no cost to becoming a member of our community!
Helpers will be asked to do the same, but instead of posting a request, they will be choosing a category in which they feel they can be the most helpful. They will then receive emails or messages, including a selection of individuals or groups with a request from their category. The Helper will then review these selections, find a story or individual that they feel a connection with and contact that person or group directly. It’s that simple!
HelpJester will also be host to “Featured Causes”. HelpJester will be the premier site for people helping people.
A way for all to assist in large scale efforts of fund raising. A monthly or quarterly home page feature, designed to focus on a highlighted cause. Veterans, feeding the hungry or victims of a natural disaster such as the recent devistation caused by Hurricane Sandy.
HelpJester's Kid's Corner
As HelpJester grows, we will be including a Kid's Corner for parents who would like to see their children experience, at an early age, the gift of giving and how empowering the experience of helping another human being can be. This is an opportunity to bring parents and children together in a worth while activity and create another generation of generosity.
Lemonade stands to help raise money for Hurricane Sandy victims, collecting clothes or toys that they could give to a family who's struggling over the holidays. There are many ways for children to get involved and experience the joy that comes with giving.
Without the means to give financially? You can still help...
If you can't afford to give financially, give of your time...to this fundraiser and later as a member of the HelpJester community. Right now, take a moment to share this fundraiser with everyone you know. The tools you need are provided right here on this site. This moment of your time will, ultimately, help in the creation of this concept and help millions in the process. Almost everyone can do something useful for others to strengthen the fabric of our shared humanity. The feeling you will experience for this unselfish act is the principle of this idea and is unmatched by riches and excess. Giving is a privilege.

<p>Fitness.Reset embodies this vision. </p>
<p>Fitness.Reset’s focus is health through diet and fitness. It’s not about specialized, expensive equipment. It’s about linking social life, exercise, and a nutritious diet into a standard of living that promotes health and fitness.</p>
<p>We seek to revolutionize the way people think about working out. Want to turn a chore that is mundane and solely results driven into something fun. We are creating a lifestyle change that will lead to positive driving forces, instead of being steered by fear of fat or obligation, all while ending with superior results. We will be inspiring people to want to change themselves.</p>
<p>We plan on affiliation through Crossfit as a main part of our plan due largely to the current success and their model of functional fitness. Their model lines up right alongside of our goals and our vision. They choose principles, morals and functionality over equipment, sales and most importantly over profit! We could not agree more!!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Ideally we would like around $25,000-$30,000 in total startup costs for Building Rent, Equipment Cost, and Certification and Affiliation Fees. We plan on doing 3 Campaigns to help us work towards this goal. We want to be as debt free as possible, not to mention we want to be a local, community supported business.</p>
<p>Our Phases will consist of:</p>
<p>Phase 1- Equipment Costs approximately $3,500.</p>
<p>Phase 2- Building Rent, approximately $16,500.</p>
<p>Phase 3- Crossfit Certification and Affiliation Costs approximately $5,000.</p>
<p>This equals about $25,000. That is before any fees or perks are paid out for our campaign. That is wherein lies the push for $30,000. WE WANT TO SPOIL OUR SUPPORTERS!! HELP US BE ABLE TO DO JUST THAT!!</p>
<p>Everything that is above each campaign goal will be rolled towards our next Phase! If we happen to go beyond our Entire Goal then that money will be used to add value to our facility by adding more/different equipment and/or upgrade our location options!</p>
<p>We have many great perk options! We are open to anything you can do to help further our dream facility! Small or large everything is GREATLY APPRECIATED!! </p>
<p>If we do not meet our goal, we will put the funds towards whatever equipment we can get. We will purchase the equipment and put it to use at our garage gym until a Carmel location is acquired!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>As we all know, Americans are becoming increasingly overweight and worse, obese. Our goal is to start teaching people, families and communities how to take small, simple everyday steps towards eradicating these very preventable scenarios.</p>
<p>Our goal is beneficial not only to our specific community, but to the whole state and country because we see in the future the possibility of being able to build ""affiliates"" and show them how to run a community-minded fitness facility based off of our success.

<p>Till the End of the Campaign for every $5.00 donated one ticket will go to a low income family of Cornwall, Ontario. Together we can make sure every child gets a chance to go.</p>
<p>Hello World, My Name is Scott Gardiner, a husband, a father, a history buff and I am a lifetime gamer. (note about the video,  being dyslexic reading out load or memorizing a script is real difficult for me, after 83 attempts this was the best I could do, I didn't get someone to read it for me because I believe the the project creator needs to make the case for himself)</p>
<p>What is the Game Room Interactive Museum? The Game Room Interactive Museum is a brand-new concept.   It is a gaming museum where you get to use the equipment and play the games. Our goal is to be able to provide 100 plus machines from Pinball to PC's, from Commodore to PlayStation, from Pong to Batman VR and over 100 traditional board games. We are committed to teaching the history of gaming, the companies, the systems and game design, while you enjoy playing the games. Each gaming unit will have a brief history of the company, the unit, lists of best selling games and memorabilia when available. We are hoping to provide each game with its manual, and examples of classic print advertising. We also wish to provide and an extensive library of gaming magazines, Roleplaying games and other gaming related materials you can enjoy over a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>The Game Room is trying to trail blaze a new way to run a museum, we are focused on immersion instead of viewing and in that vein our business plan is a bit different from for typical museum. Most museums are non-profit, they survive on government grants, loans, and admissions and many public fundraisers. Most private businesses take out huge loans, use government grants which increases the price to the public. We are going with a for profit model, between a low admission price and an internal coffee shop, we believe, we can make this museum self sufficient so we don't have to keep going to the government and public year after year. We choose the crowdfunding model for a simple reason it will keep the admission fee low, if we had to take out a start up loan a big portion of the business income would go to paying the loan which would make the admission fee $12-15.00 per person. If we could raise the money via crowdfunding the admission fee would only be $5.00 and children under 10 would get in free accompanied by a paying adult. I would really like to make The Game Room Interactive Museum as affordable to as many people as possible.Therefore, we need your help. I have three different plans depending on the support I receive from you.</p>
<p>The Game Room needs $15000.00, with that money I'll be able to provide a 2500 - 3000 square foot museum with between 80 to 100 units including pinball machines, a jukebox, rarer consoles like the Panasonic 3DO or the Atari Jaguar and an extensive selection of games. Other things the money will be used for are to help with the furniture and display costs, (I found a master woodworker that is willing to donate his time to build the stands and displays). Various other things that would make the experience better such as better lighting, more artifacts to display and of course the givebacks. If the fundraiser goes super and we exceed our goal the money will be put into more gaming systems and a better game selection with a bigger facility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If for some reason we don't hit the goal, The Game Room Interactive Museum will scale back proportionally. To a smaller place, with less stuff, I believe the museum will be able to grow from what ever we start from, even if the Game Room started as a coffee shop with a mini museum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I want to bring this concept to Cornwall, Ontario, Canada. Why Cornwall? A lot of people have asked me that over the last month. I feel its important to explain why I'm choosing to bring this project to a City with almost 50 000 people, Instead of one of the major Canadian cities. Cornwall is located on the St Lawrence River in eastern Ontario. We have a bridge to the USA, we are 1 hour west of Montreal and 1 hour South East of Ottawa and 2 hours east of Kingston. We believe that makes Cornwall a perfect day trip location for people in those Cities. In Cornwall the costs of doing business is much lower then the major centers which allows me to keep prices affordable. Cornwall also strong ""geek"" sub section of its population, as Cornwall and area Pop event (CAPE) <a href=""http://www.cornwallpopevent.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.cornwallpopevent.com/</a> has proven with 5k+ attending that event this year. The biggest reason is this is my home, born and raised here, I've spent time living in different cities around Canada and choose Cornwall to raise my family in, now it's time to do something exciting for the community, something that will increase tourism, employ a few people, and give the community a family friendly, affordable place to go. Another way the Game Room will impact the community will be all admissions on the second Saturday of a month will be donated to one of our local charities, such as Agape Center. It will be a different local charity per month, chosen on an online vote just before our projected launch date. I feel strongly about local businesses being socially responsible, this is one way The Game Room can help our community. I also developed a plan for small businesses to sponsor machines, which will be a very effective advertising program. Its a way for local businesses, not only help the Game Room but themselves as well.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This project will be a valuable addition to our community, eastern Ontario and the retro gaming community at large. When I first launched this project on Facebook a bit more then a month ago, The Game room went from 2 consoles ,1 PC and 25 board games to 43 systems, 67 different board games and 14 CRT TV's. We went from zero to over 350 followers on Facebook and over 50 followers on Twitter, about half of the garage sales I have visited have heard of the Game Room so word of mouth is getting around the city. That shows me with only advertising on Facebook and Twitter that there is a demand for this museum. The Game Room was also asked to participate in Coticon (Cornwall's Tiny Con) <a href=""http://www.coticon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.coticon.com/</a> to supply vintage games for the public to play. It will take place on August 19, 2017. Approximately 41 days before our projected opening of October 1, 2017.  I have also been approached to do interviews with 2 of the local papers in the near future. The Community is showing their excitement for this project and we are very grateful for it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is my Dream, with your help it can come true.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As you can see on the list. I tried to focus on passes to the Game Room, as the Thank You for Your Support. I have also set up multiple ways to offer Advertising space to companies by a special machine sponsorship program. We also developed a great way to say thank you for your Donation $5.00 and above will received via Facebook a Digital Picture of me Dressed up as the classic Iron man holding a Thank you sign with your Name on it (Or a Name of your Choice) on a busy street corner in Cornwall, Ontario.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>To achieve success with a project of this magnitude, we need to get not only the community of Cornwall behind us, we also need the greater surrounding area and the retro gaming community at large.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Its always risky buying old equipment. Equipment 30+ years old needs maintenance, parts and were never quite sure how much life is left in it. A lot of the maintenance I can do myself such as cleaning and basic repair work, for major repairs we would have to take it in to an electronics technician. To compound the problem these machines will be used, hopefully used a lot, that creates more turn over for repairs or replacement machines.  One of the goals of the museum is to have a spare for key machines to replace if one goes down.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>There are lots of ways you can show your support. Word of mouth for instance is been long proven the most effective way of advertising. So, talk to your family and friends get them excited for the Game Room and show them the campaign. That excitement is infectious, get them to talk to there friends and family Join me on Facebook and Twitter. Share the posts, take part in the conversations, ask your friends and family to share. Do you know business owners looking for a different way of advertising? Are you? Let them know about this. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is a saying ""No man is an Island"" and there is a lot of truth to that.  No one can make it with out the support of some sort people like friends, family and mentors. Without your help, this project. this dream would be extremely difficult if not impossible to achieve.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Thank You</h3>
<p>I would like to take a minute and thank you for your consideration, the help and support that you have given me. I would also like to Thank a few people who have helped this project get this far either by donating equipment, playing devil's advocate to make sure I thought it all through, also letting me use them as a sounding board to bounce ideas off, and help me pick up equipment. People like Randy Sauve, Barry Gasque, Gary Flaro, Mary Patrick, Richard Perras and George Gardiner. A special Thank You to, Jamie and Connor Gardiner for being patient with me for 83 takes while making the video.  Plus, a Thank You to John Bissonnette for lending me a covered trailer to store some of the equipment in. Without these people and some others, I wouldn't have gotten this far so thank you. Also, a special thank you to my wife Wendy and our children  for putting up with the amount of equipment (or as they see it clutter) in our home.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Update 1</h3>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<p>There has been a amazing amount of interest so far into this Project. Thank You so much for your support. The main Facebook post broke a 6000 people reach in the first 24hrs. with 50 shares and on the Indiegogo campaign Page we managed to drive 712 people there, with 2 donations. I know most people that intend to donate like to wait. Don't wait the more people donating even at a small $5.00 level increases the Game Room Ranking in Indiegogo. The higher the Ranking there is more of a chance of people seeing the campaign. Also people not only donate because of a good idea, a big reason why people will donate is if its popular and already getting donations coming.</p>
<p>The Game Room Interactive Museum will happen I can make sure of that. How big it will be? How many systems will be there? How huge of a selection of games will be there? Will there be a Jukebox there? How many pinball machine's will be there? Those questions can only be answered by you and your support.</p>
<p>To my supporters, Game Room Fans, the Retro gamer Community and to the people of Cornwall together we have a chance to build a museum. To do something that will help our city by providing a major tourist attraction, a low cost family friendly safe place for teen's, children, adults and families a place to go. In Cornwall there is not much here for young people you can go to a restaurant, see a movie, go to a bar or hang out at the mall or a Tim Horton's Parking lot.</p>
<p>Together let's do something special for our community. Help me bring The Game Room interactive Museum to life. Don't Wait donate and share now.</p>
<h3>Day 3 update</h3>
<p>This is a massive project. I spent the day yesterday tending to social media, contacting bloggers and press about the project hoping to get help from them to spread the word. Plus working on an old MacIntosh computer. We are up to 117 followers on twitter, 397 followers on Facebook. The Campaign has been shared over 100 times, and 8 re-tweets. Its a good strong start.<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/%E2%80%A6/the-game-room-intera%E2%80%A6/x/2816417%E2%80%A6%C2%A0You"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiegogo.com/…/the-game-room-int...</a> can get involved with this project, we need to raise our visibility on the net and we need to increase our indiegogo ranking so more people will see the project. I would like everyone to Share this project today. If everyone could share this post on their timeline and comment on the thread. It would give the campaign a must needed boost. If you know me include ""Please donate to my (friend/family member) campaign."" people you know would be much more likely to help with the campaign if you asked them to.</p>
<p>We also need to increase our indiegogo ranking. Indiegogo gets an average of 9 million unique visitors per month. So the higher rank the game room has more people will get to see the campaign. The more people that donate increases the ranking and it doesn't have to be huge donations, just donation traffic raises the ranking. So don't be shy, or think a small 2 - 5 dollar donation won't help because what we need right know, is we need every fan, every person who wants to visit the museum, everyone who wants to see this Campaign a success and everyone who likes me (even if you don't like me that is OK too) to donate $2 or $5 dollars (more if you want ) today. Show the world how badly the people of Cornwall wants this project to succeed.</p>
<p> </p>

We are hoping to provide each game with its manual, and examples of classic print advertising. We also wish to provide and an extensive library of gaming magazines, Roleplaying games and other gaming related materials you can enjoy over a cup of coffee.
The Game Room is trying to trail blaze a new way to run a museum, we are focused on immersion instead of viewing and in that vein our business plan is a bit different from for typical museum. Most museums are non-profit, they survive on government grants, loans, and admissions and many public fundraisers. Most private businesses take out huge loans, use government grants which increases the price to the public. We are going with a for profit model, between a low admission price and an internal coffee shop, we believe, we can make this museum self sufficient so we don't have to keep going to the government and public year after year. We choose the crowdfunding model for a simple reason it will keep the admission fee low, if we had to take out a start up loan a big portion of the business income would go to paying the loan which would make the admission fee $12-15.00 per person. If we could raise the money via crowdfunding the admission fee would only be $5.00 and children under 10 would get in free accompanied by a paying adult. I would really like to make The Game Room Interactive Museum as affordable to as many people as possible.Therefore, we need your help. I have three different plans depending on the support I receive from you.
The Game Room needs $15000.00, with that money I'll be able to provide a 2500 - 3000 square foot museum with between 80 to 100 units including pinball machines, a jukebox, rarer consoles like the Panasonic 3DO or the Atari Jaguar and an extensive selection of games. Other things the money will be used for are to help with the furniture and display costs, (I found a master woodworker that is willing to donate his time to build the stands and displays). Various other things that would make the experience better such as better lighting, more artifacts to display and of course the givebacks. If the fundraiser goes super and we exceed our goal the money will be put into more gaming systems and a better game selection with a bigger facility.
 
If for some reason we don't hit the goal, The Game Room Interactive Museum will scale back proportionally. To a smaller place, with less stuff, I believe the museum will be able to grow from what ever we start from, even if the Game Room started as a coffee shop with a mini museum.
 
I want to bring this concept to Cornwall, Ontario, Canada. Why Cornwall? A lot of people have asked me that over the last month. I feel its important to explain why I'm choosing to bring this project to a City with almost 50 000 people, Instead of one of the major Canadian cities. Cornwall is located on the St Lawrence River in eastern Ontario. We have a bridge to the USA, we are 1 hour west of Montreal and 1 hour South East of Ottawa and 2 hours east of Kingston. We believe that makes Cornwall a perfect day trip location for people in those Cities. In Cornwall the costs of doing business is much lower then the major centers which allows me to keep prices affordable. Cornwall also strong ""geek"" sub section of its population, as Cornwall and area Pop event (CAPE) http://www.cornwallpopevent.com/ has proven with 5k+ attending that event this year. The biggest reason is this is my home, born and raised here, I've spent time living in different cities around Canada and choose Cornwall to raise my family in, now it's time to do something exciting for the community, something that will increase tourism, employ a few people, and give the community a family friendly, affordable place to go. Another way the Game Room will impact the community will be all admissions on the second Saturday of a month will be donated to one of our local charities, such as Agape Center. It will be a different local charity per month, chosen on an online vote just before our projected launch date. I feel strongly about local businesses being socially responsible, this is one way The Game Room can help our community. I also developed a plan for small businesses to sponsor machines, which will be a very effective advertising program. Its a way for local businesses, not only help the Game Room but themselves as well.  
 
This project will be a valuable addition to our community, eastern Ontario and the retro gaming community at large. When I first launched this project on Facebook a bit more then a month ago, The Game room went from 2 consoles ,1 PC and 25 board games to 43 systems, 67 different board games and 14 CRT TV's. We went from zero to over 350 followers on Facebook and over 50 followers on Twitter, about half of the garage sales I have visited have heard of the Game Room so word of mouth is getting around the city. That shows me with only advertising on Facebook and Twitter that there is a demand for this museum. The Game Room was also asked to participate in Coticon (Cornwall's Tiny Con) http://www.coticon.com/ to supply vintage games for the public to play. It will take place on August 19, 2017. Approximately 41 days before our projected opening of October 1, 2017.  I have also been approached to do interviews with 2 of the local papers in the near future. The Community is showing their excitement for this project and we are very grateful for it.
 
This is my Dream, with your help it can come true.
 
Perks
 
As you can see on the list. I tried to focus on passes to the Game Room, as the Thank You for Your Support. I have also set up multiple ways to offer Advertising space to companies by a special machine sponsorship program. We also developed a great way to say thank you for your Donation $5.00 and above will received via Facebook a Digital Picture of me Dressed up as the classic Iron man holding a Thank you sign with your Name on it (Or a Name of your Choice) on a busy street corner in Cornwall, Ontario.
 
Risks & Challenges
To achieve success with a project of this magnitude, we need to get not only the community of Cornwall behind us, we also need the greater surrounding area and the retro gaming community at large.   
 
Its always risky buying old equipment. Equipment 30+ years old needs maintenance, parts and were never quite sure how much life is left in it. A lot of the maintenance I can do myself such as cleaning and basic repair work, for major repairs we would have to take it in to an electronics technician. To compound the problem these machines will be used, hopefully used a lot, that creates more turn over for repairs or replacement machines.  One of the goals of the museum is to have a spare for key machines to replace if one goes down.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
 
There are lots of ways you can show your support. Word of mouth for instance is been long proven the most effective way of advertising. So, talk to your family and friends get them excited for the Game Room and show them the campaign. That excitement is infectious, get them to talk to there friends and family Join me on Facebook and Twitter. Share the posts, take part in the conversations, ask your friends and family to share. Do you know business owners looking for a different way of advertising? Are you? Let them know about this. 
 
There is a saying ""No man is an Island"" and there is a lot of truth to that.  No one can make it with out the support of some sort people like friends, family and mentors. Without your help, this project. this dream would be extremely difficult if not impossible to achieve.
 
Thank You
I would like to take a minute and thank you for your consideration, the help and support that you have given me. I would also like to Thank a few people who have helped this project get this far either by donating equipment, playing devil's advocate to make sure I thought it all through, also letting me use them as a sounding board to bounce ideas off, and help me pick up equipment. People like Randy Sauve, Barry Gasque, Gary Flaro, Mary Patrick, Richard Perras and George Gardiner. A special Thank You to, Jamie and Connor Gardiner for being patient with me for 83 takes while making the video.  Plus, a Thank You to John Bissonnette for lending me a covered trailer to store some of the equipment in. Without these people and some others, I wouldn't have gotten this far so thank you. Also, a special thank you to my wife Wendy and our children  for putting up with the amount of equipment (or as they see it clutter) in our home.
 
Update 1

 
There has been a amazing amount of interest so far into this Project. Thank You so much for your support. The main Facebook post broke a 6000 people reach in the first 24hrs. with 50 shares and on the Indiegogo campaign Page we managed to drive 712 people there, with 2 donations. I know most people that intend to donate like to wait. Don't wait the more people donating even at a small $5.00 level increases the Game Room Ranking in Indiegogo. The higher the Ranking there is more of a chance of people seeing the campaign. Also people not only donate because of a good idea, a big reason why people will donate is if its popular and already getting donations coming.
The Game Room Interactive Museum will happen I can make sure of that. How big it will be? How many systems will be there? How huge of a selection of games will be there? Will there be a Jukebox there? How many pinball machine's will be there? Those questions can only be answered by you and your support.
To my supporters, Game Room Fans, the Retro gamer Community and to the people of Cornwall together we have a chance to build a museum. To do something that will help our city by providing a major tourist attraction, a low cost family friendly safe place for teen's, children, adults and families a place to go. In Cornwall there is not much here for young people you can go to a restaurant, see a movie, go to a bar or hang out at the mall or a Tim Horton's Parking lot.
Together let's do something special for our community. Help me bring The Game Room interactive Museum to life. Don't Wait donate and share now.
Day 3 update
This is a massive project. I spent the day yesterday tending to social media, contacting bloggers and press about the project hoping to get help from them to spread the word. Plus working on an old MacIntosh computer. We are up to 117 followers on twitter, 397 followers on Facebook. The Campaign has been shared over 100 times, and 8 re-tweets. Its a good strong start.https://www.indiegogo.com/…/the-game-room-int... can get involved with this project, we need to raise our visibility on the net and we need to increase our indiegogo ranking so more people will see the project. I would like everyone to Share this project today. If everyone could share this post on their timeline and comment on the thread. It would give the campaign a must needed boost. If you know me include ""Please donate to my (friend/family member) campaign."" people you know would be much more likely to help with the campaign if you asked them to.
We also need to increase our indiegogo ranking. Indiegogo gets an average of 9 million unique visitors per month. So the higher rank the game room has more people will get to see the campaign. The more people that donate increases the ranking and it doesn't have to be huge donations, just donation traffic raises the ranking. So don't be shy, or think a small 2 - 5 dollar donation won't help because what we need right know, is we need every fan, every person who wants to visit the museum, everyone who wants to see this Campaign a success and everyone who likes me (even if you don't like me that is OK too) to donate $2 or $5 dollars (more if you want ) today. Show the world how badly the people of Cornwall wants this project to succeed.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>hOMe was inspired by my mother. For the past twelve years my mother has been severly sick due to multiple spine surgeries and an addiction to pain killers. Her illness and our lack of a relationship growing up drove me into an obbsession with natural medicine since I only saw western medicine make mother more and more sick over the years. I was sure that if I could learn about healing naturally, I could help my mother heal. Six years after my first encounter with yoga, and two years after my first teacher training my dream came true. I watched my mother heal herself in threee months after committing to yoga, a raw vegan diet, herbs and supplements, and accupuncture treatment. She is now free from her addiction, walks without a cane, healed her depression, lost over 30 pounds and first the first time in a long time is happy and healthy. Her transformation inspired us to teach others how they too could heal. We came up with project hOMe. An actual house that we would convert into a wellness center completely ran off of donations. Most natural alternative medicine is very expensive and not covered by insurance. Since we do not have the money to open hOMe, we started with the resources we did have, a network of healers in the valley willing to help in parks and rec centers as well as churches churches completely off of donations. Thus Outside OM was created. Outside OM is yoga, healing sessions, reiki, massage, and raw diet counciling all for donations around the city in the places the welcome us in. We have created a community of people healing themselves and healing eachother. The only thing missing is a place to call hOMe.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would love to buy or build a house that we can completely pay off. Paying off the house will allow our healers to practice at the hOMe without paying rent to use the space. This will allow the healing center to be ran completely by donations. The donations go to the person practicing the healing or teaching the classes. We feel that this creates a win/win situation. The guest can afford the healing they deserve and the person giving can afford to make a living giving this amazing gift instead of a commercial leasing space demanding rent money causes the cost of healing sessions to be set in stone.</p>
<p>Eventually we would love to start the hOMe and Outside OM movements in multiple cities buliding healing hOMes across the world.</p>
<p>If you or any of your loved ones have suffered from addiction or suffer from life hindering illness like my family did, than hOMe can become your hOMe too. Healing should be available to everyone and so should the knowledge about natural healing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help us spread the word! If you know anyone who might be interested in offering a lending hand please refer them to us! We are always looking for teachers, healers, natural medicine practicioners, chinese medicine doctors, yoga instructors, energy work practicioners, massage therapists, raw food experts, and all other forms of natural healing.</p>

Her illness and our lack of a relationship growing up drove me into an obbsession with natural medicine since I only saw western medicine make mother more and more sick over the years. I was sure that if I could learn about healing naturally, I could help my mother heal. Six years after my first encounter with yoga, and two years after my first teacher training my dream came true. I watched my mother heal herself in threee months after committing to yoga, a raw vegan diet, herbs and supplements, and accupuncture treatment. She is now free from her addiction, walks without a cane, healed her depression, lost over 30 pounds and first the first time in a long time is happy and healthy. Her transformation inspired us to teach others how they too could heal. We came up with project hOMe. An actual house that we would convert into a wellness center completely ran off of donations. Most natural alternative medicine is very expensive and not covered by insurance. Since we do not have the money to open hOMe, we started with the resources we did have, a network of healers in the valley willing to help in parks and rec centers as well as churches churches completely off of donations. Thus Outside OM was created. Outside OM is yoga, healing sessions, reiki, massage, and raw diet counciling all for donations around the city in the places the welcome us in. We have created a community of people healing themselves and healing eachother. The only thing missing is a place to call hOMe.


What We Need & What You Get
We would love to buy or build a house that we can completely pay off. Paying off the house will allow our healers to practice at the hOMe without paying rent to use the space. This will allow the healing center to be ran completely by donations. The donations go to the person practicing the healing or teaching the classes. We feel that this creates a win/win situation. The guest can afford the healing they deserve and the person giving can afford to make a living giving this amazing gift instead of a commercial leasing space demanding rent money causes the cost of healing sessions to be set in stone.
Eventually we would love to start the hOMe and Outside OM movements in multiple cities buliding healing hOMes across the world.
If you or any of your loved ones have suffered from addiction or suffer from life hindering illness like my family did, than hOMe can become your hOMe too. Healing should be available to everyone and so should the knowledge about natural healing.


Other Ways You Can Help
Help us spread the word! If you know anyone who might be interested in offering a lending hand please refer them to us! We are always looking for teachers, healers, natural medicine practicioners, chinese medicine doctors, yoga instructors, energy work practicioners, massage therapists, raw food experts, and all other forms of natural healing.

Children and Teens seem to be much more distant from families. Across the country, we have seen many horrible crimes at the hands of young citizens. I believe that if some of those children had maybe a different environment or an extra helping hand they could reach out to, those crimes may have been avoidable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Sgt. Antonio Perez; I am a recently separated Veteran. I served in the United States Army from 2004-2012. I enlisted at the age of 17 and from the moment I arrived I attained a sense of leadership that allowed me to assist others. I moved into training many other soldiers in physical fitness as well as in combatives bas in Brazilian Jui-Jitsu. I did several tours overseas and upon my return I became part of the MMA world training at various gyms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have always been fascinated with the world of training, fitness, and self-defense but I wanted to find a way to give back to the community. MMA has taken the world by storm, people and children of all ages know what it is. Everyone wants to be in better shape and want to raise healthy children but that costs money.  Well, I would like to help the community make those dreams come true.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> I want to offer low cost mixed martial arts, self-defense, cross fit and health seminars available to all children from ages 7-18. I would like to have a mode of transportation, such as a school bus, to bring the children from their school to our training facility. This would eliminate  the need for afterschool care and make the services we offer easily accessible to all. We would also have a meal provided to each of our students and we would create a safe environment with trained personnel with child care experience as well as a counselor and nurse on site.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> I want children to be able to have a support group and develop social skills as well as perform team building activities to promote healthy relationships. Students will also be prompted to obtain better grade because we would reward based on report cards.  All children will receive necessary equipment and uniforms to participate in program thus eliminating the need for parents to incur extra expenses. All students will receive an identification card that will log when they arrive and depart, as well as give information as to who can pick them up from the facility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The funds needed are to compliment funds I have put towards this goal. They will primarily go to the purchase of the building as well as the equipment needed to set up the gym. The goal is $20,000 and I would be ecstatic if we could reach that goal but in the event that we don’t, I will continue to pursue the establishment of the training facility on a smaller scale. If you cannot donate a large amount of money, remember anything helps. If you believe in the cause please share this information and direct others to my campaign. There are many ways to contribute. I am also looking for volunteers or any trained licensed professional that would like to assist who can successfully pass a background screening with drug test.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The well-being of our children is at stake and I believe we can make a difference. If you are tired of seeing teens and young adults struggle, assist me in reaching the goal. If your children are too old for day care or you cannot afford after school care, why not put them in a program that will allow them to better themselves physically, emotionally, and mentally. </p></div>","Everyone has noticed how our youth is not the same as it once was.

<p>Hello! I am Rory Holliday and I am a 29 year old Computer Information Systems student. I have been working with computers since I was  14, I just have never had any institutional experince. I love working on computers and seeing what I can do with them, which brings me to my project.</p>
<p>I recently received a Raspberry Pi, which is a micro computer that is the size of a credit card. People all over the world have created millions of different projects with these tiny machines from home automation to making it say ""Hello World"" on a tiny screen. </p>
<p>What I want to do is make a 7 inch laptop mounted inside of a hardcover book, using the Raspberry Pi and a 7"" LCD screen. I want to make it completely portable, so that all you have to do is recharge the power supply when you're at home. I have the idea and all the experience and knowledge to do so, I just do not have the funds.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help me make at least 2 of these devices, and any contributions I receive over the initial pledge mark will go towards the purchase of more. You will help me start a business from the ground floor, and if you pledge me money I will give you priority for purchasing a finished device. </p>

<h2><strong>TO MAKE IT SHORT</strong></h2>
<p>This campaign is to help future-Founder, LaQuinda Grimes and co-Founder Lindsey Callier, fund the start-up of Cue the Lens: a non-profit dance, theatre and film organization designed to provide professional artistic training to children of low-income households- particularly underprivileged minority children (African-American &amp; Latino) in Metro-Atlanta, and eventually the nation!</p>
<h2><strong>OUR STORY</strong></h2>
<p>Cue the Lens seeks to empower the minds of participants by exposing them to disciplines of dance, film, and performing arts techniques that would be unaffordable to them otherwise.</p>
<p>Both Ms. Grimes and Ms. Callier are Atlanta-natives, SC State University Alumni, and avid dancers. Both young ladies want to make a positive change in the lives of minority children, whose exposure to extra-curricular activities may be limited or stifled due to finances.</p>
<p>Cue the Lens will provide children with a creative environment where performing arts exposes them to healthy living and wellness as a primary focus in the belief that the arts have a unique power to engage children and motivate them toward excellence.   </p>
<p>Each year, Cue the Lens will seek to transform the lives of hundreds of children in Atlanta, GA and its surrounding communities through weekly classes/camps and public performances.  Under the artistic direction of LaQuinda Grimes, Lindsey Callier and a diverse staff of professional teaching artists, programs are offered to expose participants to new cultures, languages, genres and concepts, transcending the barriers of class through the art of movement and performance. Children will learn to work together and develop personal standards of excellence, a pride of achievement, and a curiosity about the world outside of their own that supports their success in life-present and future.  </p>
<h2><strong>OUR PURPOSE</strong></h2>
<p>Cue the Lens aims to provide fun, safe, affordable ""Arts and Fitness"" experiences to children of color, ages 6-14, in low-income areas who would not be exposed to professional training otherwise. Each experience will be funded mostly or partly funded by CTL sponsors. These experiences will work on improving:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SELF ESTEEM</strong></li>
<li><strong>BODY IMAGE </strong></li>
<li><strong> PERSONAL FITNESS HABITS </strong></li>
<li><strong>THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR CULTURAL IDENTITY </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>through movement, film, and/or musical theatre training. This will be achieved through CTL's three principle focuses:</p>
<h3><strong>Friends</strong></h3>
<p>All participants will make new friends and learn the importance and foundations of healthy friendships and mutual respect. CTL will also reinforce prevention techniques of anti-bullying campaigns and teach the importance tolerance and empathy.</p>
<h3><strong>Fun</strong></h3>
<p>CTL will make each experience a enjoyable, memorable and self-gratifying event  for each child participating. The fun begins with registration!</p>
<h3><strong>Fitness</strong></h3>
<p>As participants are immersed and learn how to hone their skills in performing arts and media they will be gaining fitness habits. All the while they are having fun they will also be learning fitness techniques suitable for their bodies and the importance of loving themselves.</p>
<h3><strong>Our creed</strong></h3>
<p>We would like to gain enough sponsorships and community support,  that we may never turn a child away.</p>
<p>Once operating, 70% of monies collected will go to the operating costs of the organization and off-set the operating costs of the provided experiences. The rest goes directly toward the registration fees of children who do not have the means to attend. Any additional costs not covered by sponsorships will be covered through the above-mentioned fees.</p>
<p>Each of these experiences will be tailored to the participants' interests and the hiring entity's need. CTL Experiences can last anywhere from one week to full summers. CTL BRINGS THE FUN TO THE KIDS!!!</p>
<p>During these experiences, participants will learn choreography with the goal of presenting a showcase to friends, family, and camp sponsors as the grand finale! Once we have the funding for film equipment, interested older children will be involved in the process of capturing the experience &amp; performance on film and learn editing techniques to help with production each project, which will be packaged as DVDs for the participants, their families, and sponsors.</p>
<p>Participating children will be exposed to positive &amp; uplifting messages, music and choreography from successful mentors and volunteers handpicked for their passion to make a difference in their communities and skills in their field!</p>
<p>Contributing to this campaign will literally transform- and even bring a sense of purpose to some- young lives, more likely to be trapped in cycles of senseless violence, incarceration, drug use, failed education, and the dangers of unprotected sex.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It's been more than 15 years since it's debut and the ""Parking Lot Bash"" is back and badder than ever-- with a twist. And you can't even stop us.</p>
<p>We're celebrating old memories, anniversaries, birthdays, recovered equipment, and exes of the other sexes. </p>
<p>Cinebob is your Orlando camera rental house. A year ago we moved into our new building, and it's been a crazy first year. After having much of our inventory stolen, we recovered most of it through cooperation with OPD and the hard work of our staff. We want to celebrate our first year in our new shop, give back to our local community and have one hell of a time with friends.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order for us to make BobBobPalooza possible, we need your help. All of Cinebob's staff is working hard to make this event legen....wait for it....dary. Even with all the free man hours being put-in, we are occurring costs that are exceeding what was expected. Some of our extra costs include: Sound &amp; Lighting equipment, DJ, bartenders, bar supplies (i.e. cups, mixers, etc) Police officers, costume contest gifts, games, construction materials. These are just a few of the long list of expenses.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
It's been more than 15 years since it's debut and the ""Parking Lot Bash"" is back and badder than ever-- with a twist. And you can't even stop us.
We're celebrating old memories, anniversaries, birthdays, recovered equipment, and exes of the other sexes. 
Cinebob is your Orlando camera rental house. A year ago we moved into our new building, and it's been a crazy first year. After having much of our inventory stolen, we recovered most of it through cooperation with OPD and the hard work of our staff. We want to celebrate our first year in our new shop, give back to our local community and have one hell of a time with friends.


What We Need & What You Get
In order for us to make BobBobPalooza possible, we need your help. All of Cinebob's staff is working hard to make this event legen....wait for it....dary. Even with all the free man hours being put-in, we are occurring costs that are exceeding what was expected. Some of our extra costs include: Sound & Lighting equipment, DJ, bartenders, bar supplies (i.e. cups, mixers, etc) Police officers, costume contest gifts, games, construction materials. These are just a few of the long list of expenses.

<h3>Story</h3>
<p><strong>Hi, I am a single, 50ish grandmother raising my two grandsons, 8 and 9 years old. Working as a school nurse is very rewarding and allows me to be more available for the boys yet does not pay enough for me to meet day to day expenses plus save for emergencies and home ownership.  I dream of a modest size home (such as the example shown) where the boys have more bedroom space, a backyard for their own activities and room for their friends to gather. It would allow me to decrease cost of living and save for our futures.  Please help us afford a home to start building another set of family memories.   Something that feels more permanent than renting.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<strong>Most of the homes that would meet our needs are in the price range of $150,000 to $200,000.  However, there are homes available for under $150,000.   I qualify for some first time homebuyer government grant assistance. However, that can have certain limits on buying homes that would qualify for renovation loans, etc.  Additionally, in some cases, the seller will pay some or all of closing costs.   Ideally, I would like to have a 10-20% down payment.   However, if I don’t reach that goal, I will look for a home that the donated amount and grant assistance will allow me to purchase.</strong>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Rental prices in my area have greatly increased due to the housing market and economic landscape.  With guidance from my realtor and mortgage representative, I can decrease my monthly, and in the end, yearly living cost by owning a home.  It will be a tax advantage for me as well.  Owning will allow me more room for my bucks as well.  I want a place for the boys and me to call our own.</strong></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><strong>While not everyone can contribute monetarily, you can still assist by getting the word out about my campaign.  Share this with your family, friends, coworkers, etc.  Use the Indiegogo share tools.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you so much for your generous sharing in whatever form you can contribute!</strong></p>

<h2>Sending Baby Lucy Home </h2>
<p>As many of you know, Baby Lucy died on Friday night in Albuquerque, NM surrounded by her mother and father and other family members.  They are now faced with covering the required funerary costs to send Baby Lucy home on a plane for a burial in Minnesota while they drive home with the rest of the family.</p>
<h2>We are now humbly asking for your help</h2>

<ul>
<li>$3,000 for the mortuary and flight for Lucy to Minneapolis, MN.</li>

<li>$500 for travel expenses for the family driving from Albuquerque to Minneapolis.</li>
<li>$250 to go towards <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.indiegogo.com</a>

</ul>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

<ul>
<li>Please contribute whatever your economic situation allows.</li>

<p> </p>
<p>A year ago I set my mind into making an ""eurotrip"", to travel through Europe and Uk.  So, I begin thinking and planning what I would need to make such trip come true.  </p>
<p>What I came up with:</p>
<p>passport</p>
<p>plane ticket</p>
<p>place to stay</p>
<p>food</p>
<p>places to visit </p>
<p>and some party money  xD</p>
<p>I realize I can solve most of these issues by getting enough money.</p>
<p>I did some math and came up with how much money I was going to need. </p>
<p>Luckily I was already working on a project that year in the construction branch (I work while I study).  I was hired to assist in the building of a school kitchen.</p>
<p>One year later, a lot of hard work and a LOT of saving money and I finally came up with the amount of money I needed!!  </p>
<p>So I immediately went to a travel agency and bought my plane ticket to Spain, where I'm going to start my Eurotrip (this was on december ....  some christmas present I gave my self hahaha )  Up until now, everything was coming together nicely, just as planned.</p>
<p>So far, I have most of the things I need:</p>

<p>Now comes the tricky (and in my case, the sad) part.</p>
<p>I live in Venezuela, and in my country we have a currency exchange control. That is something that might be hard to understand for most people who dont live here, but I'll try to explain the best I can. It basically means that you can only purchase a certain amount of foreign currency (in this case, the dollars/euro I need) each year. What is worse, there is a lot of bureaucracy involved, and it's basically very hard to come up with even the small amount of Euros they allow us to purchase, even if we are going on a trip. If you want to learn some more about this, here is a wiki link (wiki can always explain things better than I can)<span>  </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_controls"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_controls</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>But!! no problem, we got something called SITME that is supposed to be an alternative way to get some extra dollars.  </p>
<p>Sadly, on <span> February 8th 2013 the president of the Central Bank of Venezuela announced that the price of the dollar increased from Bs. 4,30 to Bs. 6,30  </span></p>
<p><span>I thought WTH... less money for partying :( </span></p>
<p><span>But THEN he said that  there was going to be no more SITME. This was the only way to get the Euros I needed if I didnt have a credit card. Basically, they completely removed the only way I had to exchange Bolivares (the currency in my country) for Euros!!<br/></span></p>
<p><span>All of a sudden, all my effort and hard work became worthless because I have the money in Bolivares but no way to turn it in to Euros :S </span></p>
<p><span>I have TRIED to find alternative ways to get some Dollars (or Euros) but its simply impossible.   </span></p>
<p><span>So, this is my story and this is the last recourse I found to make my dream of trip to Europe come true.</span></p>
<p>My plane ticket is set to march 30th 2013 so I have until that day to come with a solution to the problem.  A friend of mine told me that it would do no harm to give it a shot here and see what happened. So I turn to you all, to ask for a little help!</p>
<p>THE CATCH !!!</p>
<p>AS A PROOF OF GOOD WILL I'M GOING TO DONATE THE SAME AMOUNT OF DOLLARS I RAISE HERE TO ANY CHARITY ORGANIZATIONS IN BOLIVARES HERE IN VENEZUELA ON YOUR BEHALF (WITH PHOTOGRAPICH EVIDENCE IF NEEDED),  Like I said, I have the money (I worked hard for it), the only problem is that  I need a way to turn them in to Dollars or Euros. It's very unfair that for some messed up rule in my country, I will not be able to make my trip even when I worked so much...</p>

<p>I have nothing else to do but thank all the adventurers and travelers that can help me on my quest to make my trip to the other continent. If I get the help, Ill hope to see you on the road!! (I promise I'll take a lot of pictures)</p>

<p> Iam sorry for the video not being that great. Its not rehearsed or scripted. I just told my story and it all from the heart. Iam not sure where to start...but here it go's. My name is Matthew, My company is Millienium Global Exports. I am pioneering a new industry here beautiful Puerto Rico USA. I am the one who actually got start the whole P.R Iguana meat exporting started and going! Yes i said Iguana Meat, but if you will contiune to read and watch the video you will see the greater picture.</p>
<p>We are a small P.R base company with huge possibles. Without writing out a book I will make a long story short because if you watched the video you already know the story. Here are the detail that were not in the video.</p>
<p><strong>How we got to here</strong></p>
<p>What has happened is this, we were working on a order 44k lbs of iguana meat. But because we dont have the full equipment and things we need we could not produce and send that much at one time. so we where sending 1000k+ lbs every time. and with the sale from that is what i had used to grow and buy more equipment to increasing what we could send.</p>
<p> Well fast forward about 1-2 months, we started to perpared our next shippment. and something told me to call him. now normally we dont need to call, just ship and when they recieve it they send a wire payment. But when i spoke with him they said dont send it! Because the cost of shipping is way to high. If we continued ship little parts at a time, it would cost him 1000 times more then what it should in shipping. They where paying $2K-$3k each time. and if we continued to ship that way he would end up paying about $80k in just shipping cost. compared to if we shipped all at once it cost $3200 for a container to be shipped.</p>
<p> So they said inorder to continue to buy, that it would have to all be shipped at once, no more small amounts its all or none. But the problem was i had spend my money all ready to produce it, but i got stuck with it. And if we dont start to produce and ship again soon i will be force to close and let go of my worker go and not just them but all the rest of  the jobs that would be lost. My goal is to put to work 100k+ people in the next year to 2 years. And many many more good things for the community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WITH YOU HELP!!!</strong></p>
<p> With <strong>YOUR HELP</strong> we can still make it happen. If we can get the funding in time i <strong>can still meet our goal</strong>. We can get everything we need to start shipping again and continue to grow. The more we grow the more i can do and help. And remember you are not just helping some guy save his company or some other guys job. YOU are giving hope to someone.</p>
<p>If we are buying more supplies that means that supplier keep buying from his producer. and that producer can keep hiring worker to work. and you never know that just might be your job that we are taking about or your company. As i say ""If you can help the right few, you can save a greater many.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.</strong></p>
<p>What we need it not that much compared to what we can make and do. The amount of funding we need to make it is around $15,000+. It breaks down like this,</p>
<p>Starting inorder of most urgent.</p>
<p>1. Larger ice machine 500+ lb ice maker. $3000 that includes pro. install</p>
<p>2. Second truck or van- $3000</p>
<p>3. larger faster boat to harvest with- $4000</p>
<p>4. CSA scale with label printer- $1000</p>
<p>5. more vac bags- $2500</p>
<p>6. operating cap.- $1500- this will be used for i.e gas,food, harvesting supplies and misc. supplies</p>
<p>Anyother  funding we recieve will be alocated to more things that we need such as, more stainless steel tables, small call center to continue to find and increase our sells. more supply and equipment.</p>
<p>And if we dont reach of funding goal, what funds we get will start from the top- down spending.</p>
<p><strong>FOR YOUR SUPPORT....</strong></p>
<p>In return for your support and help i will be offering the following gifts and perks. any where from samples of our<strong> exotic meats</strong>, to exotic animal skulls from some of what we harvest. Exotic skins like iguana aswell<strong> CAIMAN</strong>. We will send out a limited number of REAL raw <strong>CROC SKIN</strong> that you can have tanned or made into somthing you always wanted, right out of caiman and or iguana hide. Imagine a custom pair of shoes or that perfect purse that you dreamed of. Best of all its one of a kind. And for those who would really like to make a difference, you and one other person can fly in to puerto rico and we will take you on your very <strong>own caiman and or iguana hunt.</strong> And for the very few even a <strong>personal scenic tour drive around the tropical island of Puerto Rico.</strong> All this just for helping do the right thing and save a great opportunity for all.</p>
<p>*Please note any perk that are claimed, claimer is responsible for cost of shipping and or airfare and board here. All trips and hunting perks must be scheduled before hand. All other perks will be available after funding is completed.</p>

<h3>Recap of the Impact</h3>
<p>Keep in mind of what of our goal and what we are doing here.</p>
<p>1. We are taking a problem and turning it in to a viable and real solution.</p>
<p>2. We are helping to remove a harmful overpopulation and save the native species.</p>
<p>3. We are creating real world jobs, not just talking about or hoping for. OUR goal is 100k+ new jobs.</p>
<p>4. W<strong>ith that many jobs, you will definitely be doing your part to help our economy and country. And we an't talking about some wishful thinking on stimulating of the economy. But real life stimulating the economy. And you know what? It wasnt done by some expensive gov. proposal. or some lengthy 5-10 year plan that never happens. It wont be because of them......</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>NO it was done by YOU, the everyday normal person. Because you CARED AND YOU HELPED as well. And on behalf of all the people that will greatly benefit from this project.....THANK YOU!!!!!!</em></strong></p>

What we need it not that much compared to what we can make and do. The amount of funding we need to make it is around $15,000+. It breaks down like this,
Starting inorder of most urgent.
1. Larger ice machine 500+ lb ice maker. $3000 that includes pro. install
2. Second truck or van- $3000
3. larger faster boat to harvest with- $4000
4. CSA scale with label printer- $1000
5. more vac bags- $2500
6. operating cap.- $1500- this will be used for i.e gas,food, harvesting supplies and misc. supplies
Anyother  funding we recieve will be alocated to more things that we need such as, more stainless steel tables, small call center to continue to find and increase our sells. more supply and equipment.
And if we dont reach of funding goal, what funds we get will start from the top- down spending.
FOR YOUR SUPPORT....
In return for your support and help i will be offering the following gifts and perks. any where from samples of our exotic meats, to exotic animal skulls from some of what we harvest. Exotic skins like iguana aswell CAIMAN. We will send out a limited number of REAL raw CROC SKIN that you can have tanned or made into somthing you always wanted, right out of caiman and or iguana hide. Imagine a custom pair of shoes or that perfect purse that you dreamed of. Best of all its one of a kind. And for those who would really like to make a difference, you and one other person can fly in to puerto rico and we will take you on your very own caiman and or iguana hunt. And for the very few even a personal scenic tour drive around the tropical island of Puerto Rico. All this just for helping do the right thing and save a great opportunity for all.
*Please note any perk that are claimed, claimer is responsible for cost of shipping and or airfare and board here. All trips and hunting perks must be scheduled before hand. All other perks will be available after funding is completed.

 


Recap of the Impact
Keep in mind of what of our goal and what we are doing here.
1. We are taking a problem and turning it in to a viable and real solution.
2. We are helping to remove a harmful overpopulation and save the native species.
3. We are creating real world jobs, not just talking about or hoping for. OUR goal is 100k+ new jobs.
4. With that many jobs, you will definitely be doing your part to help our economy and country. And we an't talking about some wishful thinking on stimulating of the economy. But real life stimulating the economy. And you know what? It wasnt done by some expensive gov. proposal. or some lengthy 5-10 year plan that never happens. It wont be because of them......
NO it was done by YOU, the everyday normal person. Because you CARED AND YOU HELPED as well. And on behalf of all the people that will greatly benefit from this project.....THANK YOU!!!!!!


Other Ways You Can Help

Or if you buy and sell exotic meat or are looking to try something new and want to buy supply from us that is welcomed too. and to anybody else that might can help in anyway please contact me or let me know. Thanks you to all",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Our Story
Leading the Energy Transition, Sprouting Green Opportunities (LET’S GO Chicago) developed out of a synergy between a youth garden program and the founding of a community house in Chicago in the summer of 2010.  In its initial year, the program taught twenty neighborhood children how to grow food in the front yard of a house owned by the United Church of Rogers Park while developing sustainability solutions for the property as a whole. The program is a joint effort between the church and local youth leaders, combining urban ministry with progressive work in environmental stewardship and social justice.
This summer,  we are expanding our program by partnering with Summer of Solutions, a national youth green economy leadership training, to build up the next generation of leaders to take on some of our hardest social, environmental, and economic problems. Our Chicago program will work toward this vision by launching several initiatives to transform the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago into a replicable model of urban sustainability. We will bring youth together to achieve this vision by engaging in creative whole systems thinking that embodies the topics of sustainability, prosperity, justice, and community. 

What's Happening in 2011The youth garden program at United Church of Rogers Park will remain front and center in the summer of 2011, alongside new projects in home sustainability, renewable energy production, urban yard-sharing, and local movement building.  This year, we plan to teach up to 60 local children the basics of growing food from seed to harvest and bringing the results into the classroom for hands-on cooking and nutrition classes. Your donation today will help us achieve these goals by providing resources to purchase equipment and supplies, offer stipends to local youth participants, and support the budgets of our other project areas.

In addition to the children’s garden, our team will develop and execute projects that:
Develop the church house as an outreach center that models urban sustainability
Promote local bicycle culture
Explore small-scale renewable energy opportunities
Build a network of local groups and community members working for sustainable change in Rogers Park
 
The Impact

Summer of Solutions offers our participants a unique way of learning that moves beyond the static classroom to a learn-by-doing model which offers life changing experiences and creates concrete results that benefit the individual, the environment, and the entire neighborhood while creating an inspiring model of the change that is possible. 

This summer our program will:



Train Emerging Leaders: We teach transformative and career-building methods in community organizing and social entrepreneurship that help youth leaders create sustained and systemic change. We create competence in these skills through implementation.

Build Transformative Learning Communities: We grow from the  experiences we share with our fellow leaders. Our collaborative ventures encourage reciprocal, team-based problem solving and bring together unlikely partners to create solutions together.

Achieve Concrete Results: We develop projects that will take measurable steps towards the creation of the green economy and have real benefits for the communities we work with. Successful initiatives will lay the foundation for dramatically higher-quality and broader-scale efforts.

Create the Models: We launch community-based green economy initiatives in communities nationwide that serve as innovative models to be shared and replicated.

Share the Vision: We share our stories with the world to advance a vision of concrete and scalable solutions that catalyze grassroots leaders to transform the political, economic, and cultural landscape of the green economy.

Adapt the Process: We capture, evaluate, share, and adapt the processes we use so as to assist new solutions by ourselves and others.


What We Need & What You Get
Our $5,000 fundraising goal will help us run our summer program and ensure that opportunities to participate are available to all youth, regardless of financial need. Here is how the funding breaks down:

$3,000 Need-based stipends to offer (3) fellowships to local high school youth
$1,000 Seed money to buy equipment and supplies for our children's garden program
$1,000 Rent support to allow participants to dedicate their summer to our project

Any money generated beyond our $5,000 goal will go toward supporting our participants' cost-of-living expenses during the summer program and providing seed money for project groups. Full-time participants are expected to contribute 40 hours/week to the program. We think they at least deserve a free place to live and food on the table.

To verify that your money is going to the right place, we will be sure to keep you up to speed on our projects through the following channels:
Bi-monthly electronic newsletter sent to all donors (with the option to opt-out)
Frequently updated blog site (link forthcoming)
A thorough end of the summer report detailing the outcomes and successes of our program in each program area

Local donors are also encouraged to get in touch with us at SoS.Chicago.2011@gmail.com to schedule a tour or site visit. We would love to show you what we're up to!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Adrienne Williams, Founder of Bi Social Network. We're on a two and a 
half year journey. In December 6, 2009, we started working on creating great 
content in entertainment and news for the bi community. In 2010 the 'I Am 
Visible’ campaign kicked off, where we highlighted the face of fear in biphobia, 
with the goal to stop it. Bi people connected and made a difference through that 
effort, and I’m grateful to those who contributed videos, songs, stories, and 
love, in order to make a difference. <br/><br/><br/>Fast-forward to the end of 2011 
and moving into 2012. We are in need of visible media that showcases 
entertainment and personal stories in grand niche fashion. This is why we want 
to be the first to embark on a special journey: a project to create a bi 
magazine called ""Bi Social"". <br/><br/>Many have been emailing us and asking for 
such a product, but, to be fair, we need support from the community and allies 
if we are to make this dream a reality. Help us raise the funds to pay for 
software, servers to house our growing data, and the services of the many people 
who will help make this project a reality. We have seven writers on board right 
now, who cover entertainment, arts, politics, news and social issues. We've been 
doing this for a couple of years, and want to continue with our community's 
help, but now we know it takes people to really believe in the dream. 
<br/><br/>Help us get this project off the ground and you will have in your hands 
(or Android) a great product to read, on your favorite device or computer. We'll 
be rolling out the mag for the iPad, Android, Nook and PDF. We will have some 
special features in print. We want to do a run of 6 issues a year. We need your 
help! we know many want this product, so join us and help us succeed. <br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We already know that we have helped people all over the globe find a place where 
they can be themselves. Meeting others like them from the Netherlands to 
Iceland, from Canada to Scotland, here at home and beyond. We are touching 
lives, and we want to do even more. This project will bring great content to 
those of you who want it. You can carry your favored reader device and sit on 
the beach, read on the train or coffee shop. <br/><br/>If you help us make this a 
reality, we can keep on going, bringing great new ideas to the community. What 
better way to sponsor us on September 23 (Bi Pride Day) and beyond? Make a 
commitment as you move into 2012 with a sponsorship gift. <br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>Here are the hard facts:</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Our servers</b> costs went up 70% last month. Yeah, the good news is that this means 
folks are coming back time and time again. The bad news is that this costs more 
money: about <u>$200 a month, which makes $1,200 for 6-months</u>. You can see why 
we need to make new products that you really want.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Social Magazine - 
Indesign</b>: Great idea right? Well, the only great software that has everything we 
need to do a brilliant job on the Bi Social magazine and ebooks is Indesign. It 
retails at between <b>$800 to $1,200</b>, but not only will the community love the 
results - we can't do the job without it. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Imagery and photographers</b>: 
A mag can't run without great images and editorials on celebs. Hey, we have 
media access to movies, TV, etc, but this isn't enough. If we want real access 
to our favorite bi celebrity or artist, we have to pay to use any image of stars 
like <i>Ann Paquin</i> or <i>Green Day's</i> front man, Billie Joe Armstrong. Monthly fees 
have to multiplied by 6 to cover the 6 issues planned. With Bi Social mag in our 
store, we can make revenue to make even bigger things happen and give back to 
the greater good. The total expenditure on that comes to about <b>$2,000 to $4,000</b>. </li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>We need to attract a great designer and talented writers, so we can share the 
dream with those who want to help us with this project. Good talent works better 
with a little incentive. We are taking about a figure of around <b>$6,000</b>. 
<br/>We need reporting tools: a tripod, a camera, equipment. This would 
come to a total of around <b>$1,000.</b><br/>We need to allow for miscellaneous 
expenses: promotions/marketing/advertising, things that are always needed in 
order to get a great product into the hands of everyone. This would come to a 
total of about <b>$500</b>.<br/><br/>Whatever we get, will help us move another step 
towards our goal. We take what we have and invest it in what we can pay for, so 
that we can work another day... We're here for the long run. It's in our 
DNA.<br/>

<p><strong>Our Organic Seed Farm.</strong></p>
<p>     We are pioneers in growing organic food and organic seed for farmers and gardeners. Our isolated seed farm on the edge of the North Maine Woods is 115 acres, about half in farmland and the other half in woods. Over the years we've cleared the trees from 40 acres of cropland, constructed our home and many farm buildings, and dug two irrigation ponds. For 25 years we've sold our organic seed and food crops directly to folks like you in all fifty states through our mail order catalog and our website <a href=""http://www.woodprairie.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.woodprairie.com.</a> Our family makes our entire living from our certified organic farm. Everyone in the family has a big role in making our organic family farm successful.</p>
<p><strong>Our Involvement in the Organic Community.</strong></p>
<p>     In addition to our daily work of organic farming, we've always believed that it's our responsibility to help make our organic community strong and permanent. We have donated many thousands of hours over the last 30 years towards making Organic strong through our organic community volunteer work. We have been committed to helping transform organic family farming into a viable food system option. We've cooperated in on-farm research with scientists from the University of Maine and the USDA and this research has helped prove that organic farming is an effective alternative that is good for the land and good for the people.</p>
<p>     Jim was on the Organic Seed Alliance Board of Directors for seven hears including three years as President. During that time Jim helped create the Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association, established to protect and develop the organic seed trade. Jim is now President of OSGATA and OSGATA is lead plaintiff in the landmark organic community lawsuit, <em>OSGATA et al v. Monsanto</em> which is challenging the validity of Monsanto's GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) patents and seeking Court protection for family farmers from claims of patent infringement should Monsanto's GMO seed trespass onto our farms and contaminate our crops.

<p><strong>Our Need to Build a New Farm Equipment Repair Shop</strong></p>
<p>     The organic seed and food crops we grow require plenty of specialized older equipment. As farmers we spend lots of time repairing farm equipment, keeping our tractors running and fabricating new machines. From growing up around and working on the farm equipment, Peter and Caleb, our oldest children are accomplished mechanics and have earned the responsibility of doing most of our equipment repairs. </p>
<p>     We need a farm equipment repair shop so the boys can safely do their repair work anytime including in wet weather and during our long Maine winters.

Our Organic Seed Farm.
     We are pioneers in growing organic food and organic seed for farmers and gardeners. Our isolated seed farm on the edge of the North Maine Woods is 115 acres, about half in farmland and the other half in woods. Over the years we've cleared the trees from 40 acres of cropland, constructed our home and many farm buildings, and dug two irrigation ponds. For 25 years we've sold our organic seed and food crops directly to folks like you in all fifty states through our mail order catalog and our website www.woodprairie.com. Our family makes our entire living from our certified organic farm. Everyone in the family has a big role in making our organic family farm successful.
Our Involvement in the Organic Community.
     In addition to our daily work of organic farming, we've always believed that it's our responsibility to help make our organic community strong and permanent. We have donated many thousands of hours over the last 30 years towards making Organic strong through our organic community volunteer work. We have been committed to helping transform organic family farming into a viable food system option. We've cooperated in on-farm research with scientists from the University of Maine and the USDA and this research has helped prove that organic farming is an effective alternative that is good for the land and good for the people.
     Jim was on the Organic Seed Alliance Board of Directors for seven hears including three years as President. During that time Jim helped create the Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association, established to protect and develop the organic seed trade. Jim is now President of OSGATA and OSGATA is lead plaintiff in the landmark organic community lawsuit, OSGATA et al v. Monsanto which is challenging the validity of Monsanto's GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) patents and seeking Court protection for family farmers from claims of patent infringement should Monsanto's GMO seed trespass onto our farms and contaminate our crops. You can find information about OSGATA et al v. Monsanto on our website www.woodprairie.com, on our Facebook wall and in our Seed Piece newsletters.

Support for organic family farmers in OSGATA et al v. Monsanto.
 
Our Need to Build a New Farm Equipment Repair Shop
     The organic seed and food crops we grow require plenty of specialized older equipment. As farmers we spend lots of time repairing farm equipment, keeping our tractors running and fabricating new machines. From growing up around and working on the farm equipment, Peter and Caleb, our oldest children are accomplished mechanics and have earned the responsibility of doing most of our equipment repairs. 
     We need a farm equipment repair shop so the boys can safely do their repair work anytime including in wet weather and during our long Maine winters. We've worked out a budget and it means raising $32,000 through Indiegogo to buy the materials for the repair shop. Like we always do, we will perform the construction work itself.

We need your help to build our on farm repair shop! 
     This year will be the first phase. The repair shop will be a 30 foot by 70 foot metal building on concrete slab with radiant floor wood heat. The $32,000 will allow us to do the site work, pour the slab, construct and button-up the building shell, and begin using the shop. Future phases will allow us to add things like the large garage doors and the insulation. But the important point is that with your Indiegogo Project help we'll get our shop built and operating this year. 
     We're grateful for your support of our family and Wood Prairie Farm. Thanks so much!

<p>We were all eventually affected and soon realized how difficult it is to find work. What we have in place isn't enough to help those who want to help themselves. We believe there is a better way to help people access employment opportunities.

<p>The simplest way to explain the idea is that we post candidate profiles instead of posting jobs, and employers from anywhere in the US (and eventually the world) can see member's anonymous profile. The idea is simple - more employers can see your profile then you can send out resumes.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Here is what we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need you to make a donation, big or small, it is greatly appreciated.</li>
<li>We need $191,000 to create 12 jobs across the US working for the Hire List (US citizens and permanent residents only).</li>
<li>We need $3,000 to develop the PAID subscription part of the website.</li>

<p>In return we will allocate you the PAID subscription when we have it developed on our website.</p>

<p>If we get more than the target amount, any extra will ALL go to hiring more people or converting part-time to full-time positions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want to help break down the barriers to people finding work. Starting with us - we need the whole US community to help us hire up to 12 people. Here's how we are doing it:</p>
<ul>
<li>we are hiring from 8 designated regions in the US. That means your donation will be contributing towards giving someone a job in your region (The Hire List has defined 8 regional areas for the purposes of hiring);</li>
<li>successful candidates will be working remotely and can remain in their designated region. That means the financial benefits will be staying in your regional community;</li>
<li>most importantly of all, your donation can be helping someone you know get a job;</li>
<li>final selection of successful candidates will be based on qualifications, competencies, applicable and/or relevant experience, and not any other factors.</li>

<p>Ekura Kessim is a community located in the Central region of Ghana, approximately 18kilo meters away from the Kakum national park. Has a population of about 430 people of which women form about 57.7% of the population. The inhabitants engage in farming for a livelihood.</p>
<p>The Ekura Kessim community has no school building; children travel approximately 40minutes on foot and another 8 kilometres by bus to get to school. In addition to these, the community has no health post or clinic and all health related cases are treated in another community called Frami. They also lack a public toilet and majority of the people defecate freely in the bush and its surroundings.</p>
<p>In the midst of all these challenges, Ekura Kessim is faced with a serious water problem. They lack pipe born water or even a water borehole.This has compounded the problem of water borne and related diseases such as Skin diseases, Cholera and Typhoid. </p>
<p>Lack of clean drinking water is a major problem in developing countries. Water-borne diseases are rampant in economically depressed rural areas because clean running water is simply not available.</p>
<p>Developing Our Community will need an amount of $80,922.00 to make this happen. </p>

Developing Our Community (DOC) is a local Non Governmental Organization (NGO), that is looking forward to initiating developmental projects in four(4) important components which are; Health, Water, Plantation (Farms) and Education in various communities all over Ghana.
Objectives: 
Health:
To make sure health issues are properly investigated, diagnosed and alleviated.
Water:
To create an environment where all individuals have access to clean drinking water.
Plantation:
Help generate employment and stable income.
Education:
Support the educational sector in such communities.
 Projects such as construction of water purification systems, establishment of farms, supply of health facilities, periodical health screening, construction of school buildings and educational supplies will be implemented in over 12 communities located in the Central Region. Communities such as; Ankaako, Ekura Kessim, Frami, Junkwa and Abrafuo will be our main targets.
However Ekura Kessim has been selected as the first community to be developed with a water purification system due to feedback obtained from survey.  
1)    Back Ground Information;
Ekura Kessim is a community located in the Central region of Ghana, approximately 18kilo meters away from the Kakum national park. Has a population of about 430 people of which women form about 57.7% of the population. The inhabitants engage in farming for a livelihood.

In the midst of all these challenges, Ekura Kessim is faced with a serious water problem. They lack pipe born water or even a water borehole.This has compounded the problem of water borne and related diseases such as Skin diseases, Cholera and Typhoid. 
Lack of clean drinking water is a major problem in developing countries. Water-borne diseases are rampant in economically depressed rural areas because clean running water is simply not available.
Developing Our Community will need an amount of $80,922.00 to make this happen.

Thursday, Friday  - 3           hours per day in
the mornings     Community: Book Club– Wednesday,
Friday, Saturday – 3 hours per day in        the afternoons   * July 23rd - July 30th    In-Country Travel & Sight-Seeing The opportunity to grow further as a global leader is far too great to ignore.

<p>A finales de los noventas una

<h3>How Your Donation Makes A Difference</h3>
<p>Our campaign operates on monetary donations. All funds raised toward our goal will be donated to the Eleva-Strum Community Support Network. The network's programs assist children in need with winter clothing items, offer weekend meals to needy kids and provide gifts during the holiday season for families facing economic hardship. If and when our goal is met, additional proceeds may be directed to the Eleva-Strum Intermediate School Playground Project in memory of Zayvier.</p>

<h3>Honor Zayvier's Legacy &amp; Help Your Community</h3>
<p>Though we miss Zayvier each day, we continue to embrace his warm spirit and celebrate his legacy of care and compassion. Your donation helps ensure that every child in the Eleva-Strum School District has adequate winter clothing, meets basic nutrition guidelines and is able to experience the joy of receiving a gift during the holiday season.</p>

The network's programs assist children in need with winter clothing items, offer weekend meals to needy kids and provide gifts during the holiday season for families facing economic hardship. If and when our goal is met, additional proceeds may be directed to the Eleva-Strum Intermediate School Playground Project in memory of Zayvier.


Honor Zayvier's Legacy & Help Your Community
Though we miss Zayvier each day, we continue to embrace his warm spirit and celebrate his legacy of care and compassion. Your donation helps ensure that every child in the Eleva-Strum School District has adequate winter clothing, meets basic nutrition guidelines and is able to experience the joy of receiving a gift during the holiday season.


Spread The Word & Thank You
In addition to donating, you can help by sharing this campaign with your family and friends via email or social media. Every donation makes a difference. Small and large alike, we appreciate them all. 
Thank you for your prayers and generosity,

and outdoors-man.  Hunting and the
outdoors is in my blood, I have been doing it all my life.  I enjoy passing down the skills, and respect
of nature to new generations.  I want to
use my skills to help feed those that are less fortunate than me. I just need
some help from kindhearted people whom are tired of our children going hungry.</p>
<p>Our campaign ""Help Me Give Hunger the Shaft!!"", is to help raise awareness for a great cause and
to raise money to fund hunting trips in Texas. 
Any game taken will be donated to the Hunters for the Hungry program in the
state. Venison is a renewable resource that should be used to help feed the
hungry.</p>
<p>There is an epidemic here in Texas and around the world,
children going hungry.  According to the
USDA, 18.4% of Texas households (or one in five) experience “food
insecurity.”  An estimated 1.8 million
Texas children or 27.1% (one in four) live in these households. Texas ranks
among the top twelve states in terms of its food insecurity rate, and second in
terms of the number of food insecure households.</p>
<p>We are looking to raise at least $1500, which will be used for a few
hunting trips for me to go on in the state of Texas.  Some of the money will go to land owners for
the use of their land,  and lodging, some
will go to have the meat processed and packaged for delivery to the food banks
(under the program rules, all game must be processed and packaged by a licensed
meat processor).  None of the money will
be used for personal equipment I have the equipment I need.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I will be filming each hunt that I get to do; copies of the
video will be available for contributors of $5.00 or more that want them (Gopro video digitally
sent).  For all donations of $15.00 or more there will be a personalized certificate of appreciation.  For donations of $25.00 there will be a custom screen-printed T-shirt.  There will be 10 personalized plaques for donations of $50.00 and 5 personalized glass awards for contributions of $100.00</span><br/></p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal any funds raised will be
used for as many hunts as possible, and the rest will be donated to food banks
around the state.</p>
<p>Of course there may be a few obstacles to overcome such as:  no game presenting itself for a clean and humane
kill.  There of course is always the possibility
of hunter failure (missed shots).  One
worry is not weather, I will hunt in heat, cold, rain and wind; pretty much
whatever it takes to get the job done.</p>
<p>I have been hunting all my life; I practice with my bow
approximately 10 hours a week. I have been shooting a bow for 20+ years.  My military background, hunting skills, respect for nature and desire to help
feed the hungry gives me not only the drive but the passion to be successful. </p>

scary but amazing. Throughout my life I've been a devout Christian, but for the
first time I've been given a chance to spread the gospel in a part of the world
that really needs it. <br/>
<br/>
I have been anxiously planning this mission trip for a few weeks now and I will
be leaving October 10 to Niddrie, Scotland, which is near Edinburgh. We will be
helping the people, mainly children, in the schemes, and working with people
who plant churches in these areas. Schemes are areas with community homes given
to the poor by the government. Poverty runs free in these areas and they need
help. In this week we will also be going to a youth camp and helping out there.
The kids going are preteens and there will only be a few, but this is a chance to get to know them even more personally.<br/>
<br/>
I'm reaching out because I want to give you the same opportunity to be a
part of spreading the gospel and God's love throughout the world.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>I need to
raise $2,000 by the time the trip comes around. So far I have raised about $900, and any donation or help
fundraising would be greatly appreciated. <br/><br/>This money helps pay for my plane ticket, it supports the people who will be hosting me and my mission team, and it supports Niddrie Community Church in holding their first ever youth camp! <br/><br/>As a thank you for donating, I would be willing to draw or paint something for you, as long as you tell me what it is you want. You can contact me at sarahdejesus77@gmail.com<br/><br/>Even if I don't reach my goal, the money will still go towards the mission trip.<br/>

</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Pray for me!! This would be my first time out of the country, so I'm a bit nervous but I'm also excited.

<p>My partner (Andy) and I have worked in the tourism industry for over a decade. Last year we embarked on an extensive tour through India (which was incredible, we highly recommend it), and were lucky enough to have Mann as our personal driver (pictured with us above). Even though we thought we had seen it all in our experiences in tourism, India was eye opening for us. Our driver Mann was a prime example - he is possibly one of the most generous and genuine people we have ever met, and he taught us a lot on our travels.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in India, someone like Mann who is caring and highly intelligent, well read and personable, is limited in their future opportunities - For many reasons including family commitments, beauracracy, and lack of funds. He works incredibly long hours, conditions are challenging, and there is no such thing as sick pay, holidays or much opportunity for change. You work, or your family suffer. Mann doesn't see much of his famiy as he works as much as he can to provide, but he is 100% committed to ensuring they have what they need.</p>
<p>We have kept in touch with Mann since we left India, and he has informed us that due to decrease in tourism (low season) he is out of work for 4 months. This is of course very worrying as he has a family to support and no way to make an income at this moment in time.</p>
<p>That is where you come in....</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What are our goals?</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">We aim to raise $USD1000 or as close as we can get to this, to assist Mann in providing for his family for the time he is out of work.

We will gratefully accept any donations, and will ensure updates are posted with our progress and feedback from Mann himself. </span></p>

I'm a proud father of 8, I have 6 of my own and 2 stepchildren.  I'm a Graphic Designer for the City of Chattanooga Youth and Family Development Department. I'm trying to raise funds for  my oldest daughter Keniah Watkins as she start on her AAU Basketball journey. Keniah has been playing basketball since she was able to pick up one.  I know how much support mean, so I try to do much as possible and be that person I wished I had when I was growing up. I was a victim when it came to lack of support or my mother doing it by her self, so funds wasn't always there. AAU gives the kids a better chance of getting into college unlike a high school just mainly play around the city. It would mean everything in the world to me to see my children succeed. I look back on my life and always say ""if i had this, I should've did that"" I want to give my kids a chance. Now days in life kids are easily lead the wrong way. Her Fees start at $450 then each tournament can run you anywhere from $300 to $400 depending on how you travel, hotel rooms, food and the cost of the tournament. Tournaments start in February and goes up to September, up to 2 tournaments a month. She will be locked in with this team to 2018.  My goal is $4000, you take $350 for each tournament and for 12 tournaments it's a total $4200. And if the goal is not reached the money will still go towards whatever it can pay for. In return of her contributors you will receive a Keniah Watkins AAU highlight tape and a framed autographed picture from Keniah Watkins with thanks to all help support her dream. If your not able to contribute tell a friend or use the indiegogo share tools. Take time to check out her first Highlight tape 2013 as an 8th grader. Keniah was awarded with 
All-County followed by All-Tournament. She lead the Wildcats to be 
crowned League Champions averaging 15 points a game with a season high 
of 24 points. Not to mention, Keniah Watkins is also a Honor Roll
