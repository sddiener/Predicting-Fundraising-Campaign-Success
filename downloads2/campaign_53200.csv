<p>  To get the ball rolling, in August 2014, we opened a delivery/carryout restaurant consisting of a 250 sq. ft. kitchen, an elevated shed for dry storage and a counter with 4 stools.  We were open from 11-8, 6 days a week and pumped out fresh, delicious scratch made goodness all day.  Our thoughts were that we would get started here, build a brand, then move forward with our full service restaurant,  as planned.  All was falling into place perfectly, we were busy, my husband and I, plus 1 employee building sales day over day, week over week, month over month, year over year.  We are at the point where it is time to expand into a full service operation, we have reached our potential due to lack of time in the day, lack of space for cooking, storage and people.  We physically can't add any cooking equipment, storage or refrigeration or staff.  Unfortunately, while we have been growing, the cost of our island life keeps rising.  Commercial spaces are now to the point of no profit.  </p>
<p>So, we have decided our best course of action is to move our life and our business to a larger city with vibrant revitalization, the proper target market, a craft beer, cocktail  and food scene for us to be a part of and a comfortable setting for us and our dogs.  We are headed to St. Petersburg, Florida!  We like the city for the small business advocacy, the focus on the environment, the dog friendliness and the casual lifestyle.  </p>
<p>We have identified a space that allows us to get started on a smaller scale but fits our needs of anticipated growth and also lends to our budget, design concept and is exactly in our desired location.  The funds will be used to acquire the space, apply for required permits and begin the build out for our beer cooler and bar, purchase tables &amp; chairs, signage, and plateware.  </p>
<p>The building is on a corner in a thriving district of the city that is home to other foodie restaurants, bars, shops and nightlife.  The restaurant will seat 40-50 plus a bar that seats 15-20 and sidewalk seating for 25. The decor will be modern rustic with simple design features.  We will use beer signs that are cohesive with our decor and framed art that is representative of our Midwestern background and of the entertainment we will provide.  The menu and decor will represent the modern and rural way of the Midwest and the laid back lifestyle of Florida.  The design will use re-purposed wood, beer barrels, metals, bicycle parts, and unique lighting to provide a cozy, relaxing spot for a beer and bite to eat. </p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>The greatest challenges we will face are unforseen issues with the building during build out, shipping delays for equipment, and contractor delays. <br/>We are doing our due diligence to inspect the major components of the building prior to signing the lease, hoping to address items of concern in advance. <br/>We have established relationships with several restaurant equipment suppliers so we can use that to our advantage when buying and shipping those items. <br/>We will use local contractors who are referred to us by trusted sources in the community.</p>

Although some of them sound new age, they’ve all been around for centuries, us modern humans are only just cottoning on to what our ancestors already knew!</p></li>
</ol><p><strong>King Kale</strong></p><p>A super, super green, kale is delicious cooked or eaten raw in salads. It’s also easily blended up into smoothies and juices for a quick and simple nutritious kick. It’s one of the most nutrient-dense foods around. It’s packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, beta-carotene, and lutein which is essential for good eye health.</p><p><strong>Wonderful Wheatgrass</strong></p><p>Despite its name, wheatgrass is naturally wheat and gluten free. It’s full of fiber for healthy bowel movements and nutrients for glowing skin. It’s also alkalizing which means it helps counteract the acidic effects of alcohol, coffee, and processed foods. Grow your own wheatgrass and juice it, or add powdered wheatgrass to your smoothies.</p><p><strong>Super Spinach</strong></p><p>Made famous by Popeye, spinach is a health-giving staple green in salads, smoothies, and juices. Most well known for being packed with iron which helps keep red blood cells healthy, spinach is also high in vitamin K, essential for blood clotting. Spinach is one of the best sources of vitamin K and is also a good source of vitamins A and C, folic acid, manganese, and magnesium.</p><p><strong>Stupendous Spirulina</strong></p><p>If only one food could be hailed a superfood, it’d be spirulina. It’s a complete protein, ideal for vegetarians and vegans, and helps reduce sweet food cravings. It’s an algae, and is a beautiful deep sea green-blue color, usually found in powdered form and adds a nutritious boost to smoothies. It’s high in B vitamins for energy, the powerful antioxidant phycocyanin and Gamma-Linolenic Acid, a rich form of Omega 6 for heart and brain health.</p><p><strong>Glorious Goji</strong></p><p>Used for over 6000 years in Traditional Chinese Medicine, goji berries are a fantastic source of vitamins A, B2 and C, iron and antioxidants. They boost the immune system and help protect the heart and brain. Add to breakfast granola or eat by the handful!</p><p><strong>Amazing Acai</strong></p><p>Naturally grown in the Brazilian rainforest, acai berries are bursting with antioxidants. Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals, harmful compounds found in pollution, cigarette smoke, and UV radiation. Especially good if you live in a busy city! Add acai powder to your daily smoothie.</p><p><strong>Excellent Elderberry</strong></p><p>The tiny, deep purple elderberry cannot be eaten raw, but powdered elderberry can easily be added to juices and smoothies for a superfood boost. They’re rich in flavonoids, antioxidants that help protect our cells against free radical damage. They’re also one of the richest sources of immune-boosting vitamin C, perfect for fighting winter bugs.</p><p><strong>Captain Camu</strong></p><p>Native to the Amazon rainforest, camu camu berries are also amazingly high in vitamin C. It’s thought that just half a teaspoon of camu camu powder in water <a name=""_GoBack"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>contains over 400% of the recommended daily value! Also full of beta-carotene and other antioxidants, camu camu is great for the immune system.</p><p><strong>Neat Noni</strong></p><p>Polynesians have been drinking noni juice for centuries to boost energy and keep their immune systems strong. Recent scientific tests have shown the juice to be a good source of B vitamins, vitamins C and E, calcium, potassium, and iron. It’s also high in quercetin, a powerful flavonoid with anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>See how many of these super superfoods you can fit into your diet each day and reap the health benefits.

<p><strong>My Story</strong></p>
<p>Hi, My Name is Kristina Grimes, I am an Alumni of The Culinary Institute of America and 25 year plus veteran of the food &amp; hospitality Industry, Wife and Mother of 2 girls and the Chef/Owner of Thyme On Your Side Artisan Market &amp; Café in Farmingdale, NY<br/>            I opened Thyme On Your Side Artisan Market &amp; Café  in 2015 In Bethpage, NY and I moved the Store to this location in April of 2017 because our former location was not conducive to the growth of the business for many reasons. I was in a situation where the Landlord did not want to renew my lease and I had to find a place very quickly that was close enough to be able to keep my current customers. 396 Conklin Street was presented to me at the perfect time as a sublease situation that was supposed to be temporary. Although the space did not have a real commercial kitchen and was to be shared with the current tenant at the time, I was willing to make it work until I could find a permanent spot. The intention was always to move to a space on Main Street that had a proper Kitchen. Since this all had to be done within a couple of weeks’ time I was not able to really investigate the situation and the sublease, although written up and approved by both lawyers, ended up not being valid because it was not approved by the landlord. At this point I had already moved in and was set to open the next day so after some renegotiating I was able to take over the lease which was quite costly but was my only option at the time.</p>
<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Since our relocation the business has been growing faster than we can handle in the current kitchen or lack thereof. Although being busy  is a good problem to have I am working with only 2 induction burners as my stove, a convection oven and three steam kettles of which only one works. We have just about tripled our daily sales in just a over a year and are in desperate need of the right equipment which will be way over what the business can afford all at once.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>At this point I have two options which is what I need the funding for, both will keep the business in Farmingdale which is the goal. One is to stay in the current location and build out a kitchen which will be very costly. Second is to move to a space on Main Street that is for sale and has more foot traffic, a full commercial kitchen, dining and retail area that will be large enough to accommodate our growing customer base</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>My funding goal to be able accomplish this and stay in business in Farmingdale is approximately $50,000.00. This will cover all moving expenses, a public bathroom so that I can have seating, a few more small appliances and a paint job. Everything else we already have and it's just waiting to be utilized.</p>
<p>So check out all of the  great perks we are offering in exchange for your contributions and Please Help out if you can.</p>

Hi, My Name is Kristina Grimes, I am an Alumni of The Culinary Institute of America and 25 year plus veteran of the food & hospitality Industry, Wife and Mother of 2 girls and the Chef/Owner of Thyme On Your Side Artisan Market & Café in Farmingdale, NY            I opened Thyme On Your Side Artisan Market & Café  in 2015 In Bethpage, NY and I moved the Store to this location in April of 2017 because our former location was not conducive to the growth of the business for many reasons. I was in a situation where the Landlord did not want to renew my lease and I had to find a place very quickly that was close enough to be able to keep my current customers. 396 Conklin Street was presented to me at the perfect time as a sublease situation that was supposed to be temporary. Although the space did not have a real commercial kitchen and was to be shared with the current tenant at the time, I was willing to make it work until I could find a permanent spot. The intention was always to move to a space on Main Street that had a proper Kitchen. Since this all had to be done within a couple of weeks’ time I was not able to really investigate the situation and the sublease, although written up and approved by both lawyers, ended up not being valid because it was not approved by the landlord. At this point I had already moved in and was set to open the next day so after some renegotiating I was able to take over the lease which was quite costly but was my only option at the time.
The Challenge
Since our relocation the business has been growing faster than we can handle in the current kitchen or lack thereof. Although being busy  is a good problem to have I am working with only 2 induction burners as my stove, a convection oven and three steam kettles of which only one works. We have just about tripled our daily sales in just a over a year and are in desperate need of the right equipment which will be way over what the business can afford all at once.
The Solution
At this point I have two options which is what I need the funding for, both will keep the business in Farmingdale which is the goal. One is to stay in the current location and build out a kitchen which will be very costly. Second is to move to a space on Main Street that is for sale and has more foot traffic, a full commercial kitchen, dining and retail area that will be large enough to accommodate our growing customer base
How You Can Help
My funding goal to be able accomplish this and stay in business in Farmingdale is approximately $50,000.00. This will cover all moving expenses, a public bathroom so that I can have seating, a few more small appliances and a paint job. Everything else we already have and it's just waiting to be utilized.
So check out all of the  great perks we are offering in exchange for your contributions and Please Help out if you can.

The Sunday Morning Hangover Helper uses a 4 Pronged approach to helping you recover from a Hangover.
 Dihydromyricetin (DHM) and Artichoke extractArtichoke extract: Artichoke is used to stimulate the flow of bile from the liver, and this is thought to help reduce the symptoms of heartburn and alcohol hangover. Dihydromyricetin also known as Ampelopsin which naturally occurs in Asian plant species such as Ampelopsis grossedentata (Moyeam tree) has been used in traditional Asian medicines for years as a tea to cure hangovers and liver disease. Essential Vitamins and MineralsThe B-complex vitamins, Vitamin C and some electrolytes are especially vulnerable and are destroyed by alcohol. These vitamins are essential to our physical and mental well being and are included in Sunday Mornings Hangover Helper kit in reasonable doses.  Sulbutiamine is an advanced form of vitamin B1 (thiamine)  which is absorbed in the body more readily allowing replenishment to brain cells.   ElectrolytesOur product includes an electrolyte balance recommended by the world health organization for re-hydration therapy!  Again, in reasonable doses.  White willow bark extract and CaffeineWhite Willow Bark Extract and Caffeine help soothe headaches. Willow Bark is Nature’s AspirinOur kit includes the same amount of Caffeine as a cup of coffee, not too much. Caffeine helps with headaches and a natural diuretic to flush out toxins after re-hydrating.   Consult your physician before using our product if you are allergic to Aspirin or taking blood thinner medications OUR PRODUCT IS COMPOUNDED AND PACKAGED IN THE USA IN FACILITIES WHO FOLLOW FDA RECOMMENDED GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES (GMP)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Pure Roasters are a 2 person team based in Dumbarton, Scotland.  We've been blending ethical coffee beans for the last year and have established a good name in the coffee world.</p>
<p>Due to our continued popularity we have been growing fast.  To accommodate this new business we want to move into a coffee manufacturing plant and introduce some new more experimental coffees to the Scottish market.</p>
<p>This is where we need you!  We have spent every penny we have in getting new roasting equipment built while keeping up with rising operating expenses due to increased sales.  A good problem to have, but a problem nonetheless...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This campaign will raise the small amount of up-front investment needed to add to our range of blends by introducing flavour fusions e.g Whisky barrel, Scottish Heather, lavender and vanilla.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need £10k to order the additional beans, grinding machinery, infusion elements and packaging.</p>
<p>In return for your investment we will provide you with exclusive access to our new blends and a 4 tier reward system:</p>
<p>£10 - We will send you a personalised thank you note and a 250g bag of the latest blend.</p>
<p>£20 - We will send you a personalised thank you note and a 1Kg bag of the latest blend.</p>
<p>£100 - You will receive 6 months of our coffee subscription service 1Kg package inc T-shirt</p>
<p>£1000 - If you are kind enough to invest £1000 you have naming rights over one of our micro batch blends, 1 year of 1kg per month coffee subscription and every piece of merch we release in the next year.  You may also visit the new roastery to see your blend being made and take bags home as gifts for family and friends. </p>If we don't reach the entire goal within the short 1 week time-frame we will still use funds to assist in our roastery move and will honour the tier system with currently available blends.</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have come on leaps and bounds since operating a small cafe in Dumbarton.  We used the time well to find out what customers want in a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>We intend to grow our team up to 15 staff by end of year 3.  Your investment will help us achieve this.  Our monthly sales are already above £10k per month and we have over 250 regular coffee subscribers.</p>
<p>Aside from the funny names, our coffee really does make a difference to the farmers who produce it.  We only ever use ethically sourced beans and make sure the farmers are paid well.</p>
<p>Your money isn't just going to a promising Scottish company and creating jobs in an area that needs the work.  You are also helping to eradicate commodity (slave trade) coffee from the world market.</p>
<p>Our new premises should create a small amount of tourism too, with visitors dropping by to sample the freshest coffee Scotland has to offer.</p>

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>In Little Rock, <strong>only 1 out of 2 Black households</strong> are able to seek and sustain a thriving life defined by economic wholeness. Between disinvestment and lack of resources in Black communities, many of Little Rock's hardest workers are faced with grim choices for survival and little room to dream.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>*WellBrewed Coffee Co will change that.*</strong></u></p>
<p><u>Our plan</u> is to start a Black-owned, mobile coffee company.</p>
<p>But, more importantly, <u>our purpose</u> is to do coffee with consciousness by <strong>d</strong>riving <strong>r</strong>esources and <strong>i</strong>nvestments to <strong>p</strong>eople in the places that have been historically overlooked and trapped by economic inequities. That's right. A portion of the proceeds from our coffee sales will be dedicated to Black leaders and entrepreneurs committed to social change. That's why our tagline is ""Brewing real D.R.I.P."" Because we are re-defining the concept of drip as a movement with and for the betterment of Black lives and communities.</p>
<p>Supporting our campaign would not only give us the capacity to diversify the coffee scene in Little Rock but would also help us make room to begin addressing the wealth gap which continues to stifle the Black community at-large. </p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>To get our coffee truck up and running, we need at least $20,000! We know that the ask is sizable - but we are believing God for abundance. Our lives have been immeasurably enhanced by the generosity of our village. In many ways, our own dreams have taken shape because of the various investments of encouragement we have received over the years. And, now - as we see more and more Black death plastered on the news and small screens, <strong>the time is now to invest in Black life</strong>.  </p>
<p>We've done our research and hope to purchase the following with the funds raised:</p>
<ul>
<li>A trailer, which will serve as the foundation for our mobile operation ~$2,500 </li>
<li>Coffee equipment, such as an espresso machine, grinder, etc. ~$4,500</li>
<li>Coffee truck retrofitting/building the mobile operation &gt;=$10,000</li>
<li>Purchase of supplies &amp; permits ~$3,000</li>
</ul>
<p>By donating, we are happy to offer you several personalized perks, such as free coffee, swag items, and more. Click on the perks to see more details!</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>

</div></div>","Short Summary
In Little Rock, only 1 out of 2 Black households are able to seek and sustain a thriving life defined by economic wholeness. Between disinvestment and lack of resources in Black communities, many of Little Rock's hardest workers are faced with grim choices for survival and little room to dream.
*WellBrewed Coffee Co will change that.*
Our plan is to start a Black-owned, mobile coffee company.
But, more importantly, our purpose is to do coffee with consciousness by driving resources and investments to people in the places that have been historically overlooked and trapped by economic inequities. That's right. A portion of the proceeds from our coffee sales will be dedicated to Black leaders and entrepreneurs committed to social change. That's why our tagline is ""Brewing real D.R.I.P."" Because we are re-defining the concept of drip as a movement with and for the betterment of Black lives and communities.
Supporting our campaign would not only give us the capacity to diversify the coffee scene in Little Rock but would also help us make room to begin addressing the wealth gap which continues to stifle the Black community at-large. 
What We Need & What You Get
To get our coffee truck up and running, we need at least $20,000! We know that the ask is sizable - but we are believing God for abundance. Our lives have been immeasurably enhanced by the generosity of our village. In many ways, our own dreams have taken shape because of the various investments of encouragement we have received over the years. And, now - as we see more and more Black death plastered on the news and small screens, the time is now to invest in Black life.  
We've done our research and hope to purchase the following with the funds raised:

A trailer, which will serve as the foundation for our mobile operation ~$2,500 
Coffee equipment, such as an espresso machine, grinder, etc. ~$4,500
Coffee truck retrofitting/building the mobile operation >=$10,000
Purchase of supplies & permits ~$3,000

By donating, we are happy to offer you several personalized perks, such as free coffee, swag items, and more. Click on the perks to see more details!
The Impact
Our vision is to find out how much good can come from a well brewed cup of coffee. To do that, we have an intentional model for social impact. Our recipe for impact has three ingredients: Rise. Grind. And Shine.

To Rise is to become conscious of solutions inviting your participation
To Grind is to engage in the cultivation of your gifts 
To Shine is to serve your community

Practically, that means our mobile coffee experience will include coffee sleeves with calls to action concerning pressing social issues, events connecting folks with other community leaders and business owners, and, finally, curating opportunities for pouring assets and the necessary change into our city.
Risks & Challenges
We are not strangers to hard work. We are young professionals, pastors, and people with diverse passions and gifts. But this coffee company will take our hustle to a new level. On top of that, a startup on the heels of a global pandemic will certainly present various challenges.
Challenges like:

Ensuring safe operational measures, including social distancing, when serving customers
Selecting ethically, locally, and (hopefully) Black-owned products, vendors, and contractors
Overcoming the hardships of entrepreneurship in an unstable economy

But, we've calculated the risks. And have decided that the reward of pouring into our communities is well worth taking our chances. So, regardless of the difficulties - we are betting on Black.  Other Ways You Can Help
So, what will it take for us to get there? 
Well, we need people like you - coffee drinkers with consciousness - to connect with us. Join your drip with our drip. Be a part of this family. This movement. This roast to get you woke.
With your support, we hope to begin operation by no later than Spring 2021.
In the meantime, we’re asking you to donate (if you are able), tell all your family and friends, and share this campaign on all your social media channels. And while you’re at it, follow us on Facebook and Instagram @wellbrewedcoffeeco.

<p>Hello, my name is Albert Mackoty. I’m an immigrant from Sierra Leone, West Africa. I grew up in communities where everyone depends on the environment for good nourishing food. The good thing is, the food I grew up with is all-natural, organic, GMO free, chemical free etc.</p>
<p>My wife and I started this Chiiri yogurt project 3 years ago in a quest to find the perfect dairy option for our picky son led us back to our roots.  With research and experimentation, Chiiri yogurt is now available in few stores in Abbotsford and Surrey.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555880537/p5oihgwlhvhymujrvnbd.jpg"" src=""""/><i>Albert at a Chriiri Yogurt demo/tasting at Save-On-Foods, Abbotsford</i></p>
<h3><strong>A Thousand Years in the Making</strong></h3>
<p>Chiiri Yogurt has a storied history dating back more than 1000 years, when ancient inhabitants of the Sahel region in Africa hawk fermented milk products in characteristic beautifully decorated calabashes balanced on their heads. In West Africa, where is it known as Latchiiri or Bacee -a mildly sour-tasting yogurt is Africa’s heritage, and is still considered the best of all dairy products currently available.  Nothing tastes quite like it. It is made from fermenting milk into yoghurt and eaten with millet, sorghum, corn or couscous, either in the same bowl or separately. It is very satiating and keeps you feeling full and energized for the whole day. The yogurt is served only on special occasions and to VIP guests. This is very special!</p>
<h3><strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong></h3>
<p>Currently, we’ve launched Chiiri in one Save-On-Foods store through their amazing BC Local program to assist small local entrepreneurs. We want to scale up the recipe so we can make Chiiri available in a grocery store near you. But that is just the first step in a largely uphill battle to be able to share Chiiri on a wider scale on grocery store shelves. </p>
<p><strong>How the Big Supermarket Game Works </strong></p>
<p>Despite a lot of excitement and interest about Chiiri, the grocery game is largely a <strong>PAY to PLAY</strong> game, and an expensive one too. There are two primary barriers that make it extremely hard for new entrants like us: Slotting Fees, and Category Captains.</p>
<p><i><strong>Slotting fees</strong></i> are fees that most large grocery chains in North America charge in exchange for a new product to have shelf space in their stores. These fees have been known to run anywhere from $25k for regional placement up to several million for national placement.</p>
<p><i><strong>Category captains</strong></i> are a common practice also used by these chains whereby they allow the leading sellers of a particular category, e.g. yogurt, ice cream, etc. to decide where all of the other products should go on the shelf. In practice, this gives them the advantage of being able to place competitor products in hard to access or little noticed areas of a shelf, for instance behind a hinge in the freezer aisle. 80-90% of new products fail within a relatively short period of time (<a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2001/02/ftc-releases-staff-report-slotting-allowances-and-other-grocery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FTC Staff Report, 2001</a>). </p>
<p>This <strong><a href=""https://www.vox.com/2016/11/22/13707022/grocery-store-slotting-fees-slotting-allowances"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">article</a></strong> and short <strong><a href=""https://youtu.be/ImZD2JGxbmc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">video</a></strong> from Vox (<strong><i><a href=""https://www.vox.com/2016/11/22/13707022/grocery-store-slotting-fees-slotting-allowances"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The hidden war over grocery shelf space</a></i></strong>) provides a good illustration of how these practices can pose enormous barriers to entry for a new product like Chiiri, and the consequence is that consumer choice is significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is still a way for new players to enter the market. This requires a grassroots effort like Save-On-Foods’ amazing “Local Program.” Save-On-Foods have given us a chance at proving ourselves at the local level, and eventually to a regional level, if merited, brought to the national level, and potentially even across the border in USA and Mexico! Ultimately, if there are enough people demanding our product, we will be able to allocate some of the funds raised towards the most critical aspects of getting Chiiri onto store shelves. </p>
<p>Our hometown of Abbotsford and the province of BC is a particularly favorable place for a new food startup to thrive, and we believe we can get to the top with your support. Together, we can overcome!</p>

<h3><strong>Our Goals for this Campaign Project</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Goal 1 - Head Above Water: $15,000 </strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Uncle Ted's Chilli Jam is a jam like nothing on the market. Our Chilli Jam is a freshly made product giving a spicy Indian taste to many dishes. We at Uncle Ted's believe in ""Farm-to-Table"" where we find local farmers in the Catskill's area of New York and Pennsylvania to grow our fresh ingredients on a seasonal basis.  Since our jam ages well over time, we hope to make smaller batches at different heat levels to keep the freshness and quality to the highest standard.</p>

<p>Our short story is about a family who many years ago took a leap of faith and crossed the oceans to find a better life. After 30 years two family members found themselves to be such foodies. After spending many days and nights only talking about food and the places they had cooked, recipes where exchanged between them. With books that could have been written by them, one took the chance of making Chilli Jam for his new friends and family. Seeing the response was far greater than he could have imagined, he moved to the countryside and with his farming ideas started making and designing the product. With the drive to eat freshly made foods, he would like to bring this to the market for all to try and share. With your help he would be able to open the business and sell the product at local farmers markets and online to people around the United States.</p>
<p>Where are we now:</p>
<p>After a year of testing and coming up with different levels of heat, we have a 10oz jar with a great label and design. We have proved that we can make Chilli Jam safe for storage in a jar until opened. Last summer 100 jars where made and sealed to be given out for outside judgment.  With no surprise the response was overwhelming, with most people coming back for more or asking for orders so they could give out as gifts.</p>
<p>We want to open the company and get testing from the FDA at Cornell University so we can sell in a retail setting. Since we believe in staying local and giving back, we have found two shared kitchens that can be rented for us to produce and package the product safely to all FDA standards and start making small batches.</p>
<p>Please come join us on our journey in bringing our product from our table to yours by placing a pre-order or just by funding us.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Uncle Ted's Chilli Jam is a jam like nothing on the market. Our Chilli Jam is a freshly made product giving a spicy Indian taste to many dishes. We at Uncle Ted's believe in ""Farm-to-Table"" where we find local farmers in the Catskill's area of New York and Pennsylvania to grow our fresh ingredients on a seasonal basis.  Since our jam ages well over time, we hope to make smaller batches at different heat levels to keep the freshness and quality to the highest standard.
                                          
Our short story is about a family who many years ago took a leap of faith and crossed the oceans to find a better life. After 30 years two family members found themselves to be such foodies. After spending many days and nights only talking about food and the places they had cooked, recipes where exchanged between them. With books that could have been written by them, one took the chance of making Chilli Jam for his new friends and family. Seeing the response was far greater than he could have imagined, he moved to the countryside and with his farming ideas started making and designing the product. With the drive to eat freshly made foods, he would like to bring this to the market for all to try and share. With your help he would be able to open the business and sell the product at local farmers markets and online to people around the United States.
Where are we now:
After a year of testing and coming up with different levels of heat, we have a 10oz jar with a great label and design. We have proved that we can make Chilli Jam safe for storage in a jar until opened. Last summer 100 jars where made and sealed to be given out for outside judgment.  With no surprise the response was overwhelming, with most people coming back for more or asking for orders so they could give out as gifts.
We want to open the company and get testing from the FDA at Cornell University so we can sell in a retail setting. Since we believe in staying local and giving back, we have found two shared kitchens that can be rented for us to produce and package the product safely to all FDA standards and start making small batches.
Please come join us on our journey in bringing our product from our table to yours by placing a pre-order or just by funding us.
 
Be mindful and always eat fresh food.
                                                                                   
We are looking for funding in two ways.
You can pre-order jars to be shipped once the FDA approval is made. All pre-orders will be shipped in the first batch made in 2018 with a shipping date of August.
Or make a pledge into our dream and story with no reward.                                                                                                                   
Chilli Jam made with Indian imagination
Used as a spread or dip for any dish
Made from fresh ingredients
Our pledge to our customers is making Chilli Jam in small batches from local fresh ingredients so we can give you the best quality. Each year we will take steps towards having our own farm, so we can produce most of our ingredients in house.       
 

                                Pre-Ordering
$12 Single jar of Uncle Teds Chilli Jam at the level of heat that is just right for you. Shipping not included.
$36 For our family set, 3 bottles from level I to Level II. This set is designed for everyone in mind no matter how much heat you can handle. Shipping not included.
$48 For all four levels we make. With each level increasing until you get to the top level of the Chilli Jam. Shipping not included.
                                                                                   
                                                                Make A Pledge to our funding
Open pledge without a reward.
$200 A personal thank you letter and thank you on our website with a delivered of a family pack, a sticker.
$500 A personal thank you letter and thank you on our website with a delivered of all four levels, a sticker.
$1000 A personal thank you letter and thank you on our website with a delivered of all four levels, a sticker and plus extras.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I’m Brittany, former co-owner and creator of Everyday Gourmet Cafe and Badass Power Cookie.  I am passionate about food and it’s important to me that I don’t harm anything in the process.  Being a working mom has had its highs and lows, so starting small to have more flexibility is gonna be my jam.</p>

<h3>The Beauty of Whiskey</h3>
<p>In 2015, we embarked on a journey to combine our love of art , America, and quality spirits. We created an <strong>Award-Winning </strong>straight bourbon and spent 3 years developing a unique bottle that envelops art, culture and premium bourbon.</p>
<p>We tasted bourbon from all over the country and studied the artistic and cultural values in sculpting a representative image of a proud and strong woman.</p>
<p><strong>Fred Minnick,  world renowned whiskey judge - “I like that (American Woman Whiskey)…very approachable…it’s a good whiskey.”</strong></p>
<p>Help us realize something unique. The process is underway with 30% of the funds allocated in order to move into full scale production. Initial funds have gone towards the costs of bottle and label design, patent submissions, TTB fees, website design, preliminary marketing research and  bourbon formulation. We’re not looking for venture capital at this stage, we want to engage whiskey lovers like you to help us launch American Woman Whiskey® in early 2020.</p>
<h3>Distilled in America</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566058888/nfannuuu5aphh6ngzkhp.png"" src=""""/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>In contemplating the perfect American whiskey experience, a small-town physician from a midwestern city, a west coast artist and a passionate whiskey maker from Colorado joined forces and created what some may consider a bold work of art. A work to be appreciated for its beauty, strength and enduring spirit.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Design</h3>
<p>We combined three great things: Art. Whiskey. America. In 2015, the doctor commissioned the artist to create a sophisticated and elegant sculpture that held all the simple, yet complex, elements of beauty taken from every culture in this land of diversity. The result was a proud and enduring rendition of a woman with a strong forward gaze, so unique as to win a United States Design Patent in April, 2018. After the bottle was tested and retested for strength and function, a long and difficult task given the complex shape and contour, the creation of the perfect whiskey was finalized.  Result:  Award-winning American bourbon in a stunning bottle.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Yes. There are risks and challenges, and we are fully aware of them. How do we ensure that our whiskey will have the necessary quality to do well on the market? We will by aging only the most premium bourbon under meticulous conditions and quality control.  By relying on the expert distiller to make sure it is consistently premium bourbon, we can achieve that goal. </p>
<p>Also, we will be bottling in early 2020 at best. The market could change, taxes could increase, tariffs could become a factor, but these are factors we can't control. And who would ever give up a dream based on future scenarios one cannot control?  One of our key strengths is that we have a US patented design on a bottle unique in a crowded market.  And, we have a tested straight American bourbon to complete the package. Any bold concept such this unique bottle has risk in the marketplace, but we are promoting the love of good whiskey in a tribute to art, whiskey and the strength of women not only in America but around the world. </p>
</div><h3>What We Need </h3><ul>
<li>$100K to secure and age 63 barrels of our premium straight bourbon at 90 proof.</li>
<li>$10K to manufacture our custom bottles in high quality flint glass which includes a wood top cork, tin capsule and gold fleck custom label.</li>
<li>$5K to obtain and maintain any patents as well as any legal fees associated with production.  We have plans for 1-2 more spirits including tequila and rum for which we need to secure trademarks and design associated labels for those spirits.</li>
<li>$28K for pre-launch marketing to include, social media, print, billboard, radio, and any other needed venue.  This will be essential for a brand such as AWW since it will disruptive in a very competitive market.</li>

In 2015, we embarked on a journey to combine our love of art , America, and quality spirits. We created an Award-Winning straight bourbon and spent 3 years developing a unique bottle that envelops art, culture and premium bourbon.
We tasted bourbon from all over the country and studied the artistic and cultural values in sculpting a representative image of a proud and strong woman.
Fred Minnick,  world renowned whiskey judge - “I like that (American Woman Whiskey)…very approachable…it’s a good whiskey.”
Help us realize something unique. The process is underway with 30% of the funds allocated in order to move into full scale production. Initial funds have gone towards the costs of bottle and label design, patent submissions, TTB fees, website design, preliminary marketing research and  bourbon formulation. We’re not looking for venture capital at this stage, we want to engage whiskey lovers like you to help us launch American Woman Whiskey® in early 2020.
Distilled in America
 

The Idea
In contemplating the perfect American whiskey experience, a small-town physician from a midwestern city, a west coast artist and a passionate whiskey maker from Colorado joined forces and created what some may consider a bold work of art. A work to be appreciated for its beauty, strength and enduring spirit.

The Design
We combined three great things: Art. Whiskey. America. In 2015, the doctor commissioned the artist to create a sophisticated and elegant sculpture that held all the simple, yet complex, elements of beauty taken from every culture in this land of diversity. The result was a proud and enduring rendition of a woman with a strong forward gaze, so unique as to win a United States Design Patent in April, 2018. After the bottle was tested and retested for strength and function, a long and difficult task given the complex shape and contour, the creation of the perfect whiskey was finalized.  Result:  Award-winning American bourbon in a stunning bottle.

<p>Long time Seattle resident, Evan Leichtling, started cooking at the age of 17, and spent over 10 years in some of the best kitchens of Seattle - sous chef to John Sundstrom at Lark, chef de cuisine of La Bête, Harvest Vine, the list is long.</p>
<p>Evan moved to Europe in 2014 to try his hand in European kitchens and found himself in Paris by 2015. He quickly became the chef of Dune in Paris' 11th arrondissement, developing his signature style of cooking seasonal food, informed and influenced by the various techniques he has learned over the span of his now 15 year career in kitchens.</p>
<p>Evan returned to Seattle in early 2019, along with his partner in business and in life, Meghna Prakash, seeking to put his mark on the growing food scene and open his own restaurant. Meghna is Indian born and raised, and lived in Paris for 10 years, nursing a growing interest in natural wine. She has been getting up to speed on the city's thirst for good wine by working with some of the best distributors in Seattle. You may recognize them both from Fowl &amp; Offal, the pop-up concept that they've been running for about 6 months now, introducing Seattle diners to unique proteins and focused on working with local farmers.</p>

 Gracias infinitas por apoyar a este proyecto!   La Revolucionaria est une bière blanche, légère et rafraîchissante, avec une légère touche citronnée, produite en Belgique, un pays à forte tradition brassicole, récemment considérée comme Patrimoine Culturel Immatériel de l'UNESCO sous le titre de : La culture de la bière en Belgique. Élaborée avec des produits locaux et naturels (bio), au sein de la brasserie de la Lesse, dans la région des Ardennes belges.La brasserie de la Lesse est une coopérative à finalité sociale, c’est à dire que, contrairement aux autres entreprises, le capital social de la coopérative appartient aux travailleurs et aux personnes désireuses de faire partie du projet, stimulant la consommation de biens locaux, le circuit court et les produits bio.La Revolucionaria est une bière au coeur mexicain, créée pour les plus fins gourmets et voulant révolutionner la façon de déguster une bière, en buvant de façon responsable vu qu'en la buvant plutôt qu’une autre, vous contribuez non seulement à diminuer les émissions de CO2, mais vous collaborez également à la création de l’emploi local, vous consommez des produits de qualité, naturels et bio, tout en soutenant des projets sociaux, éthiques et justes, en d’autres mots, vous contribuez à un monde meilleur en la buvant!L’objectif que nous nous sommes fixés pour la première étape du projet, est de lancer cette recette déjà créée. Dans la seconde étape, nous partirons à la recherche de collaborations avec des maîtres brasseurs mexicains, afin d’être reproduites dans le continent européen et asiatique, en important du Mexique les matières premières nécessaires pour la production de ces recettes (comme par exemple: le maïs, le cacao, café, sésame, épices autochtones,...)Etant une bière sociale, la Revolucionaria cherchera à soutenir des activités et projets d’artistes ou d’entrepreneurs mexicains qui vivent à l’étranger. Pourquoi soutenir ce financement participatif?Parce que c’est une bière locale, pensée pour la communauté mexicaine, c’est une recette réalisée à base de produits locaux et bio, dans une coopérative à finalité sociale.La première étape de ce projet est de consolider et distribuer une bière créée pour la communauté mexicaine, une bière légère, idéale pour accompagner les tacos, les tostadas, les sopes, et les flautas,... de la cuisine traditionnelle mexicaine. Si cette première étape se termine avec succès, la seconde étape s’ouvrira à la participation de la communauté de mexicains en Europe, afin de créer l’étiquette et la recette de la prochaine bière La Revolucionaria.En soutenant financièrement cette initiative, vous contribuerez au lancement d’une série de recettes afin d’élaborer des bières à base de produits comme le cacao, le café, le sésame et les épices autochtones,... Vu que ces ingrédients sont typiquement cultivés au Mexique, l’on recherchera des coopératives mexicaines qui les produisent et elles seront soutenues directement grâce à la production de ces bières.Cette bière souhaite soutenir, financer et aider à diffuser des projets locaux de mexicains vivant en Belgique, mais également prévoit d’offrir un soutien en général à des projets sociaux de la communauté de mexicains en Europe et principalement, vu qu’elle est produite avec différentes valeurs sociales et protégeant l’environnement; dans la seconde recette, ces mêmes valeurs seront recherchées chez les producteurs des denrées mexicaines afin de produire davantage de recettes en Europe ayant un impact économique positif direct auprès des fournisseurs mexicains. En buvant cette bière, tu contribueras à:
Créer de l’emploi localement
Promouvoir un projet engagé au niveau social et environnemental
Soutenir des entrepreneurs et artistes mexicains
Consommer des produits respectueux de l’environnement
Favoriser la consommation de produits locaux et de qualité

<p>December 17, 2009, my father, Mackie Bigby  was called to Heaven after a 5 year battle with cancer. Ninety days prior, he initiated a dialogue to prepare me for the years without him. He touched on topics such as winterizing the house, spring clean up, and of course, the care of his precious lawn. Not lost was the responsibility that he was bestowing: the care of his beloved wife and his youngest son. He warned that it would be difficult but that it would be the most rewarding undertaking of my life. He said the smiles and joy that you can place on them, will be your way to honor me. He was absolutely correct in stating that at times it would be difficult. What better way to honor my father than for our ""family"" to create and share Devil's Reef Cinnamon Spiced Rum with you! </p>
<p>In a world where the locked up dreamer stuck in a 9am-5pm constantly tries to find the balance between success and relaxation, Devil's Reef Cinnamon Spiced Rum, offers a pathway to paradise. Devil's Reef was born out of the search for an answer to an oversaturated vodka market that failed to represent the passion, individuality, and importance of taste while transporting the mind and body to a state of calm and relaxation. </p>
<p>We are two Long Island guys that created this brand at Mackie's Long Island kitchen table and had it bottled in New York. We have completed all of the heavy lifting to get the liquid in the bottle and the bottle to the shelf. We are looking for our campaign to assist with purchasing, advertising, promoting, and marketing Devil's Reef. We must court our distribution partner as well as the bars, restaurants, and stores that we want to carry our brand. These relationships are critical to the success of any brand. The funds raised will guarantee us the opportunity to solicit the key retailers and on premise accounts in our marketplaces. It will provide flexibility to develop incentive programs for all of our partners.  In store sampling, promotional models, drink vessels, bar mats, bar caddies, branded clothing, etc... will all be provided with your assistance.</p>
<p>One of the major risks in launching an alcoholic beverage brand is finding a distributor that will bring your product to the consumer.  In the three tiered alcoholic beverage market, the consumer (you) and the producer (me) must be linked by a distributor.  We have crossed that bridge. Devil's Reef is distributed by nationally licensed beverage alcohol importer, distributor, and service provider MHW Limited, headquartered in Manhasset, NY.  With over 81 years of experience in alcohol distribution, Devil's Reef is part of a proven legacy of exceptional and timely service  that meets the needs of consumers nationally. </p>
<p>Your investment will help more than words can say. YOU will be directly involved in the success of Devil's Reef Cinnamon Spiced Rum. Best thing is... you will be able to responsibly sample the goods that you are supporting. We've come a long way on our own, but now we need you to blow it up! In the short term, we are looking to touch EVERY licensee in New York. That's 8000 establishments with a liquor license; stores, bars, and restaurants.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have intensely battled over what to offer as PERKS for the varied amounts of donations. We decided that it is important to achieve the goal. By offering GEAR as the PERK, we can ensure that the cost of the PERK does not become a barrier to achieving the GOAL. Also, the invite to a Devil's Reef Cinnamon Spiced Rum event provides us with an intimate setting to TRULY thank you for your support. Please help us honor our Dad over a glass of Devil's Reef.Thank you in advance for your support.<br/> </p>

<h3>About this Campaign</h3>
<p>Hey y'all,<br/>My name is Joshua Eilts and I am the creator of Tasting Notes.  I've always been passionate about good coffee and the idea of a coffee shop that had live music benefiting independent artists.  This is the first step in that dream.  I've spent an ample amount of time explaining to people how to achieve a good cup of coffee, but it's always started with one thing: fresh roasted beans.  I want to offer great coffee to everyone while also connecting people with new musical experiences.  I don't think roasting coffee in my popcorn popper is going to work for the masses, and yes...that's a thing.  I am looking at investing in a proper roaster that allows me to tweak my roasts, be more consistent, and pump out larger quantities to my customers.  However, I need a little help getting off the ground.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm not asking for a free handout, and all of the contributions will be pre-purchasing some great coffee, at a discounted rate.  All of the initial contributions will be going toward a few very important things</p>
<ul>
<li>The Roaster:  The Huky 500T will be the roaster of choice.  Hand built by Mr. Li out of Taiwan, the Huky 500 is a solid drum roaster that uses propane as its heat source.  This will be paired with Artisan roasting software in order to get a calculated, consistent, repeatable roast.</li>
<li>Beans!  I am going to offer two origins of beans at launch.  Most likely an Ethiopian that will be roasted lighter to highlight more fruity notes and a bean from another country that focuses on chocolate and nutty tasting notes.  Soon, we will offer exotic roasts at a slightly premium price.</li>
<li>Administrative costs.  TastingNotesCoffee.com is LIVE!  Head on over to check it out.  Bags, labels, logos, permits all come at a cost.  Most of these have already been purchased, but some of the initial wave of funds will go towards future fees as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out our PERKS!</p>
<ul><li>All of our contributors will enjoy a bag of freshly roasted beans aimed at a delivery date in December 2017.  My goal is to have the roaster and first wave of beans purchased after the first 30 days of this campaign while the remainder of the funds will go towards new beans and administrative costs.</li></ul>
<p>What if we don't reach our goal in 60 days?</p>
<ul><li>It might take a little longer than our anticipated December launch.  Most importantly, if you contribute you WILL receive your perk.  If we don't reach our goal in 60 days look out for a launch in 2018.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Without you, this may not be possible.  Give us a shot.  The lowest perk we offer is for a bag of our beans at a discounted rate.  The more you give, the more you save in the long run.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any company, some of the risks we face are customer acquisition, and cost to sustain the business.  This has all been evaluated and figured into the campaign.  I've been passionate about coffee for many years now, and that's not going to change overnight.  I'm pretty sure every Christmas when asked ""What do you want?"" from family and friends, my replies have always been something coffee related.  I will always be roasting, and therefore, Tasting Notes will always be here, shipping great quality coffee to your doorstep.  If the customer base dies down, the few that remain will get to enjoy some great beans, and have opportunities to try rare exotics in the future.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>So maybe funds are tight right now, or even worse...you don't drink coffee.  First off, I have to wonder, maybe you've just never had a GOOD cup of coffee.  Nonetheless, you can share this campaign.  Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, I know you have some kind of social media presence.  Share this campaign so that the coffee lovers in your life can experience a cup of coffee brewed with Tasting Notes beans.  The second way you can help is to help out an artist that you know and love by sending them over to <a href=""http://tastingnotescoffee.com/artists/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://tastingnotescoffee.com/artists/</a> to fill out our submission form.  If we get enough submissions, we can create a larger playlist, and possibly highlight more than one artist a month.</div></div>","About this Campaign

<p><i>One day I was sitting in my house and I was in the mood for a mid-day snack. As an avid fitness fanatic and health-conscious eater, I decided a banana with almond butter would be a good option. As I used a knife to place the almond butter on the banana (like I have always done), the banana broke for the thousandth time and fell on the floor. Of course, that was my last banana and it was about 15 degrees outside, so running to the store was not an option. I thought to myself ‘life would be so much better if I could get that almond butter inside the banana’. I immediately went to my computer to try and order something and quickly realized nothing existed to </i><i>core</i><i> and fill a banana………… And My Banana Buddy was born! </i></p>

3-Easy Steps
 

Step 1: Core an unpeeled banana.
Simply slide the banana down the coring guide, placing a perfectly symmetrical core down the center of the banana.  
 

Step 2:  Remove the banana   
Hold the coring guide and remove the cored banana. The banana core remains in the stainless steel coring tube.   
 

   Step 3: Inject your favorite filling 
Use the Banana Buddy injector to fill the cored banana with your favorite filling. No need to cut or peel the banana. 
 

Step 4: Enjoy your healthy snack
The filled banana is a great on-the-go snack or can be placed in the refrigerator or freezer and enjoyed at a later time.

The History Of My Banana Buddy
One day I was sitting in my house and I was in the mood for a mid-day snack. As an avid fitness fanatic and health-conscious eater, I decided a banana with almond butter would be a good option. As I used a knife to place the almond butter on the banana (like I have always done), the banana broke for the thousandth time and fell on the floor. Of course, that was my last banana and it was about 15 degrees outside, so running to the store was not an option. I thought to myself ‘life would be so much better if I could get that almond butter inside the banana’. I immediately went to my computer to try and order something and quickly realized nothing existed to core and fill a banana………… And My Banana Buddy was born! 
- Sam Proffitt, creator of My Banana Buddy

<h3>The Deepwater Story</h3>
<p>The farm was founded in 2015 by Paul Shumlich and Kevin Daniels, local graduates from Mount Royal University and the University of Calgary. The farm that started in a garage grew into a 3,000 sq. ft. prototype farm and now we're about to open the doors to our brand new, 10,000 sq. ft. commercial farm.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Nutritious Vegetables </h3>
<p>By supporting our campaign, you are freeing Calgary from its dependence on foreign farmers. We will be able to supply Calgarians with fresh, local vegetables all year-round! Right now we are growing kale, arugula, mustard, watercress and red pac choi. Soon, we'll be able to grow a whole lot more!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Fresh Fish</h3>
<p>Finally, Calgarians will be able to buy fresh seafood! We are raising one of the world's most nutritious fish (barramundi) and we will be expanding our farm to offer a fish to every Calgarian who wants one. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We believe in transparency and farming is not without its risks. Crops can fail and fish can die. Growing indoors means a large amount of energy is consumed to run grow lights.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have the resources to overcome these challenges. We are investing in the most efficient lightings systems ever invented and we use cutting edge seeding and harvesting technologies imported from the Netherlands to make the farm on of the fastest, most efficient and most effective in the world.</p>
<p>We are not trying to change the world alone, we are working with some of the best minds in the business, universities, and government organizations who can help us push the technology forward.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Mi Sueno Catering is a small family-run business that has been serving healthy, nutritional meals for over 10 years. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and Washington States lockdowns, it crippled our infrastructure, the commercial kitchens that we used closed, and our products became limited. And even in these dire circumstances we continued to find ways to feed those in need, those that were homebound and unable to leave due to the crisis, our veterans and senior citizens!</p>
<p>Realizing how difficult this has been to them and to us we have decided to open our own small commercial kitchen so that we are in control of our time and impact to the community. So that we may continue these services and offer support to more families that are in a similar situation. Please consider suporting our campaign, so that we can continue to grow and expand our services, and hopefully soon we will see you again! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As things are slowly opening up we continue to provide much needed meals and support to our most vulnerable. With your help and support we can open our own commercial kitchen and expand our services. We have obtained a beautiful space on the Kitsap Penninsula so that we may stay local and strengthen our infrastructure by maintaining our support of local farmers and businesses. We are hoping to raise $25,000 so that we may purchase much needed equipment such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commercial Hood w/Suppression Unit</li>
<li>Commercial Stove</li>
<li>Setup Fees/Permits</li>
</ul>
<p>As a thank you for your support, we are offering you some ¨awesome perks¨, yummy food, gift certificates, merchandise, ¨How to"" videos on how to make some latin faves, group meals, and more! </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The pandemic showed us how vulnerable our catering business is by creating some difficult challenges: state closures, closed kitchens, limited supplies. Due to these challenges it has pushed us to strengthen our business model. Having our own commercial kitchen will allow us to keep our doors open and continue to provide healthy meals to our communities, it will create more jobs and maintain support of our local economy. In addition, by re-structuring our model we have begun offering grab and go meals, pop up sites, and delivery this will allow us to sustain operations if more difficulties arise.</p>

We realized although cuisines around the world vary greatly, wine enhances any meal. You can take the simplest meal and turn it into one to remember by pairing it with a bottle of wine. Aside from trying out many great restaurants around London, we love to cook Californian cuisine - lots of fresh fruits and vegetables with seafood and poultry. We realized that this ""farm to fork"" food goes especially well with German Riesling. <br/><br/>Thus the inspiration for <strong>Nackt </strong>(""naked""). German wine with a Californian twist started in London. <br/>

</div></div>","Background.  We met in London and fell in love over all of the amazing international food the city has to offer. We realized although cuisines around the world vary greatly, wine enhances any meal. You can take the simplest meal and turn it into one to remember by pairing it with a bottle of wine. Aside from trying out many great restaurants around London, we love to cook Californian cuisine - lots of fresh fruits and vegetables with seafood and poultry. We realized that this ""farm to fork"" food goes especially well with German Riesling. Thus the inspiration for Nackt (""naked""). German wine with a Californian twist started in London. 

We Need Your Help.
 We are delighted to share with you our first wine - a 2014 Riesling. In order to make this happen however, we need your help. 
We invested our own money to cover the grapes to make 1000L of wine and basic production costs, but we still need to raise £2000 so you can enjoy our wine. We need funds to help us finance: 

Bottles, caps, labels, and packaging
Bottling 
Labeling 
Transportation 

What You Get in Return.
Other than feeling great for helping to make our business come to fruition, we are offering you extra perks if you help us out.  



£25: a set of custom wineglass charms. 
£50: a custom reusable wine bag. 
£100: A fine box of German chocolates - because who doesn't like chocolate with his wine? 
£250: A bottle of our wine along with that fine box of German chocolates. 

£500: Come help us harvest our 2015 vintage in Germany.

£750: Come help us harvest our 2015 vintage in Germany and bring a guest with you for the weekend!

**Special deal for London locals: Contribute £50 and receive a limited, first edition bottle of Nackt Wein.

After extensive research, Bower gained an understanding of many of the secret subtleties of whiskey making in the lost coves and difficult terrain of the mountains.Chris is not the only member of the Eda Rhyne team that has a family history populated by proud, self-sufficient outlaws. Owner/Distiller Pierce Harmon’s ancestors were rum runner’s around Wilmington and the Cape Fear River basin. Pierce’s ties are not only coastal, as the other side of his family were bootleggers in the foothills of North Carolina supplying the Statesville area with spirits during prohibition. Today Pierce is an owner/contractor at River Birch Builders and is supervising the construction and build-out of Eda Rhyne Distillery. This work includes the distillery floor as well as a tasting room where patrons will be able to taste our hand crafted spirits during a guided tour of the facility. Running the daily operations at the distillery is owner/distiller Andrew Bertone. Andy’s interest in spirits, specifically whiskey, began in Lexington, Kentucky where he worked as a helicopter mechanic for the United States Marine Corps. Andy uses his love of whiskey and the technical abilities he learned during his service to maintain the distilling equipment with precision, insuring our products are of the highest quality. It is this high quality and distinctively North Carolina identity that makes Eda Rhyne unique. It is our attention to the process from grain to glass that will make Eda Rhyne exceptional.We will be bottling a Rye Whiskey that embodies the spirit of North Carolina. We are currently working with Carolina Ground and Riverbend Malt House to source heirloom grains and malt that captures long-lost local flavors.Our Pinnix Gin will be a juniper forward New American style. The botanical make up will be made from local ingredients, some grown on Owner/Distiller Rett Murphy’s Aardvark Farm, others responsibly wild crafted from the mountains surrounding Asheville.Eda Rhyne’s Appalachian Fernet is made from a secret recipe that combines over fifty different alpine herbs and medicinal plants from Western North Carolina to create an evocative interpretation of this classic Italian digestif. Bold, balanced and smooth, its perfect at the bar, the dinner table or the camp site.Finally, our Forest Floor Amaro combines the earthy bitterness of roots and bark with the fresh fragrance of wild flowers to create this captivating bitter. Eda Rhyne’s Forest Floor Amaro is distinctive and refreshing much like the mountains that inspired its recipe. The folk medicinal qualities and angelic flavors it captures are sure to keep your spirits high and your body happy.Now we need your support to help us achieve our vision.

<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
<p><strong>Curators Reserve is a Craft Spirits Distillery based in Gold Coast, Australia with a passion to curate &amp; handcrafted <i>Sophisticated Artisan Spirits.</i></strong><br/><br/>It has been a dream of mine to combine my years of Distilling Industry interests gained while attending multiple international courses and exploring many major &amp; Craft Spirits Distilleries (36 plus - I like to research) plus a Masters of Science.  Now is the perfect time to launch &amp; open Curators Reserve Craft Distillery on the Gold Coast as the Craft Distillery scene in Australia is so HOT right now, as has been the trend across the US, Canada &amp; UK.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489636452/imvpgzn6sjj1qfpt8397.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><br/>Organic ingredients are our focus in order to curate a diverse &amp; exciting product portfolio. Sri Lankan Cinnamon, Japanese Mountain Pepper, Australian Lemon Myrtle, Albanian Juniper,  Peruvian Cacao, Ecuadorian Cardamom &amp; Ethiopian Arabica Coffee are just a handful of the meticulously sourced ingredients.</p>

<p>Maturation barrels are en-route with Port Barrels from Portugal, Sherry Casks sourced from Spain, Heavy Char Bourbon &amp; New American Oak from the USA &amp; French Oak wine barrels from some of Australia's most prestigious &amp; awarded wineries. Rum, Whiskey &amp; Brandy in Australia has to wait a precious 2 years before we can release for sale - while we ever so patiently wait (&amp; count sleeps), our focus is firmly on our amazing range of creative Vodka, Gin, Moonshine, Cocktail Bitters &amp; Liqueurs.</p>

<p>So now we need a couple more things.  First &amp; foremost our Twin-Kettle Distillation equipment specifically designed for handling Double-Distilled Spirit production of barrel aged Rum, Whiskey/ Brandy &amp; or further distillation for Vodka.

<h3>THE IDEA</h3>
<p>Hear me out: vegan, organic, bicycle-delivered donuts straight to your door. Interested? That’s my passion! I want to bring vegan organic donuts to Tallahassee. I believe we are capable of creating the city we want to live in, and I want to live in a city with a vibrate, fun, and environmentally conscious food scene. I want to live in a city where I can visit a local store or market and find Dandelion Donuts! Organic vegan donuts in fun flavors delivered via bike and served with completely compostable packaging. Featuring vibrate, fun and exciting flavors like pistachio and rose, seasonal fruit fritters, and key lime custard filled.</p>
<p>THE OPERATION</p>
<p>Dandelion Donuts will be operated out of everyone's favorite local restaurant, Sweet Pea Cafe. Sweet Pea Cafe has been an established and successful vegan restaurant for more than 6 years.  Donuts will be made 3 days a week and delivered to cafes, hotels, small businesses and individuals via a cargo bike. We’ll also be set up at events and markets around town, like the Saturday French Town Farmers Market.</p> <p>Funds raised here will go towards buying our fancy donut frying robot, licensing costs, compostable packaging, bulk ingredients and signage. See below for a complete breakdown of costs and where funds will go:</p>
<p>MY BACKGROUND</p>
<p>My name is Marina Mertz. I’ve owned and operated Anhaica Bag Works, a successful, small bicycle bag company based in Tallahassee, FL for more than 4 years. I have worked as a baker for a local catering business and private wedding cakes. </p>
<p>WHY VEGAN?  </p>
<p>It’s a really simple choice when it comes to donuts- there are no drawbacks. Its extremely  hard to tell the difference between a donut made with dairy and eggs and a vegan donut made with without. You eliminate 2 common food allergies. Plant based diets are also more sustainable, requiring less land and resources than dairy and egg farming.</p> <p>WHY ORGANIC?  </p>
<p>Organic farming uses less energy, emits less greenhouse gasses, nitrous oxide and ammonia.</p> <p>WHY BICYCLE DELIVERY?  </p>
<p>As you can probably tell, we are those tree huggers your momma warned you about. We just want to cut all sorts of carbon emissions! Cars are a huge source of personal pollutants and by using our electric assist cargo bike for deliveries we not only can cut down on our own carbon emissions but we can also be a positive model in our community for alternative transportation. Also have you ever ridden a bike? It’s fun as heck!</p> <p>WHY COMPOSTABLE PACKAGING?</p>
<p>Zero waste is a philosophy that encourages circular life cycles so that no products are sent to landfills. This lifestyle isn’t easy in the world we live in today with unlimited free plastic packaging, although a growing movement of people are living in a zero waste way,  I really believe it is going to take producers of goods to really make a huge impact. All of our packaging will consist of recycled material when possible and be fully compostable, we also encourage you to refuse the packaging and bring your own re-usable container and we do wholesale deliveries using re-usable containers as well.</p> <p>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</p>
<p>As with all food based businesses, licences and production can hit some speed bumps. I am working in partnership with the French Town Food Incubator to help me identify and meet these challenges. If not able to raise complete funds, I will use the partial funds to buy the donut fryer and start with a smaller scale operation selling donuts to Sweet Pea Cafe and at the farmer's market  and slowly grow to selling wholesale donuts (plan b).  </p>
<p>If you are not able to financially contribute, don’t worry there are plenty of ways to help! Share this campaign with your friends via social media, ask your favorite cafe to become a seller of Dandelion Donuts, mention it to your boss that you would prefer dandies at your monthly meeting or even come pick up a few flyers to distribute!</p> <p>Cost Break- Down</p>

<p>Licensing - $1,060</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who are we?</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>We are Farmer Girl</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Farmer Girl is a food enterprise comprised of a small restaurant in Lyons, Colorado that focuses on organic, local and sustainable foods.  Our goal is to make this cooking approachable, affordable and delicious.  Farmer Girl has been in existence since 2014, first operating as a food truck and is owned by Chef Tim Payne.  Tim has been cooking local and organic foods in Boulder County since 2007 and co-owned the restaurant Terroir in Longmont for five years. Farmer Girl in Lyons has been open since February 2016.  During this time we have contributed thousands of dollars in purchases with our local and organic farms, ranches, dairies, distillers, breweries and wineries.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why are we doing this?</strong></p>
<p>Our current location, serves the Lyons community as well as the influx of vacationers that come to Lyons and nearby Estes Park and Rocky Mountain National Park. While we do serve some residents in nearby Longmont we strongly feel to adequately serve ALL of the residents in Longmont as well as nearby cities such as Lafayette, Niwot, Erie, etc. a second location in Longmont will expand our service area and offer an unique dining experience that is exclusively dedicated to local, organic and sustainable foods to their residents.  Currently, there are very few if any dining options that have this commitment to this goal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our New Location</strong></p>
<p>Our new location in Longmont will be in a new building located in south Longmont in the Prospect Neighborhood.  This location is conveniently located to our local farms we have been using for nearly 10 years as well as convenient to the service area referenced above.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our Goal is to raise $50,000 to be used towards the opening our new location.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What are we using the funds raised for?</strong></p>
<p>Funds we are able to raise will be used for the following purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>purchase of necessary kitchen and bar equipment</li>
<li>purchase of necessary dining room amenities such as tables, chairs, etc.</li>
<li>obtaining necessary licenses and permits to open for business</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<p>Perks for Contributing</p>
<p>$50 level-Free attendance at one of our monthly Beer Pairing Dinners currently hosted at our Lyons location</p>
<p>$100 Level-Free attendance for 2 at one our  Sunday Night Wine Club dinners currently hosted at our Lyons location.</p>
<p>$250 Level-Free attendance for 4 at one of this summers Farm Dinners hosted at our network of local farms.</p>
<p>$500 Level-Farmer Girl hat or t-shirt, free attendance for 2 at one of our Sunday Night Wine Club, free attendance for 2 at one of our monthly beer pairing dinners, free attendance for 2 at one of our Farm Dinners.</p>
<p>$1000 Level-Farmer Girl hat, Farmer Girl t-shirt, Dinner for 8 at Farmer Girl's new Longmont location.</p>
<p>$5000 Level-Chef Tim will prepare a private dinner for up to 10 either in your home, at our garden at Lone Hawk Electric Gardens, or at the new Longmont Farmer Girl Location.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What Happens If Our Funding Goal Is Not Reached?</strong></p>
<p>We are using flexible funding which means we get to keep what is raised regardless of whether our goal is reached.  So any money you donate will get to us and will be used towards the opening of our second location and for the purposes listed above (equipment, furniture, etc.).</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>We fill very strongly that in order for the local foods movement to march forward and be successful, it needs entities like us to be available and convenient to the public.  By having our second location, we will reach more people and thus be able to contribute more of our food purchases towards the local organic community.  As we succeed and grow our ability to purchase more from our local farmer partners will grow as well.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></div><div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Of course you can contribute, knowing  your contribution will help us in our goal to bring our type of food to this community.  If you can not contribute, please help us spread the word about what we are doing with friends, co-workers, and acquaintances through conversation, facebook, twitter, etc.  Just getting the word out about what we are doing will help us along towards our goal.  You may also share this campaign through Indiegogo's sharing feature.</p>

Our current location, serves the Lyons community as well as the influx of vacationers that come to Lyons and nearby Estes Park and Rocky Mountain National Park. While we do serve some residents in nearby Longmont we strongly feel to adequately serve ALL of the residents in Longmont as well as nearby cities such as Lafayette, Niwot, Erie, etc. a second location in Longmont will expand our service area and offer an unique dining experience that is exclusively dedicated to local, organic and sustainable foods to their residents.  Currently, there are very few if any dining options that have this commitment to this goal.
Our New Location
Our new location in Longmont will be in a new building located in south Longmont in the Prospect Neighborhood.  This location is conveniently located to our local farms we have been using for nearly 10 years as well as convenient to the service area referenced above.
 
What We Need & What You Get
Our Goal is to raise $50,000 to be used towards the opening our new location.
What are we using the funds raised for?
Funds we are able to raise will be used for the following purposes:

purchase of necessary kitchen and bar equipment
purchase of necessary dining room amenities such as tables, chairs, etc.
obtaining necessary licenses and permits to open for business


Perks for Contributing
$50 level-Free attendance at one of our monthly Beer Pairing Dinners currently hosted at our Lyons location
$100 Level-Free attendance for 2 at one our  Sunday Night Wine Club dinners currently hosted at our Lyons location.
$250 Level-Free attendance for 4 at one of this summers Farm Dinners hosted at our network of local farms.
$500 Level-Farmer Girl hat or t-shirt, free attendance for 2 at one of our Sunday Night Wine Club, free attendance for 2 at one of our monthly beer pairing dinners, free attendance for 2 at one of our Farm Dinners.
$1000 Level-Farmer Girl hat, Farmer Girl t-shirt, Dinner for 8 at Farmer Girl's new Longmont location.
$5000 Level-Chef Tim will prepare a private dinner for up to 10 either in your home, at our garden at Lone Hawk Electric Gardens, or at the new Longmont Farmer Girl Location.
What Happens If Our Funding Goal Is Not Reached?
We are using flexible funding which means we get to keep what is raised regardless of whether our goal is reached.  So any money you donate will get to us and will be used towards the opening of our second location and for the purposes listed above (equipment, furniture, etc.).

The Impact
We fill very strongly that in order for the local foods movement to march forward and be successful, it needs entities like us to be available and convenient to the public.  By having our second location, we will reach more people and thus be able to contribute more of our food purchases towards the local organic community.  As we succeed and grow our ability to purchase more from our local farmer partners will grow as well.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
 
Of course you can contribute, knowing  your contribution will help us in our goal to bring our type of food to this community.  If you can not contribute, please help us spread the word about what we are doing with friends, co-workers, and acquaintances through conversation, facebook, twitter, etc.  Just getting the word out about what we are doing will help us along towards our goal.  You may also share this campaign through Indiegogo's sharing feature.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Beer <i>that </i>Benefits</h3>
<p>I'd like to take credit for the idea, but that honor goes to my best friend from high school, <strong>Jimmy T.</strong>  My name is <strong>Tom Costa </strong>and I'm the founder and President of Dr. Jekyll's.  Sitting in my backyard barbecuing and having a cold one some 10 years ago, my buddy turned to me and said, ""you know, everyone drinks beer, what if you could get an added health benefit from it, kinda like Vitaminwater?""  The comment made sense coming from Jimmy, as other than being an overzealous beer drinker, he also was an all natural bodybuilder (the two don't normally go together),  nutrition expert and scientist at GlaxoSmithKline.  I replied, ""great idea, if only I had the time and a few million bucks."" Back then, I had 18 years of brewing under my belt, both as an avid home brewer and as an apprentice on a commercial brewery. So, not only did I see the value in the idea, but I also knew the challenges. It's one thing to have an idea...another to actually execute it.</p>

<p><strong>Jimmy T &amp; I doing what we like to do best - fishin' and drinking Dr. Jekyll's beer</strong></p>
<p>Fast forward to today. Jimmy's idea is now a reality.  Dr. Jekyll's ""beer with benefits"" is sold in major retail chains in California to include <i>Whole Foods, BevMo, Total Wine, Bristol Farms, </i><i>Cost Plus World Market </i>and <i>Raley's. </i></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">So what makes us different?  </p>
<p>We are the <strong>world's <strong>first </strong>and only </strong>organic, non-GMO, vegan craft beer that is brewed with super foods that targets different areas of the body using patented technology.  <strong>No other beer company in the world can do this! </strong>We can brew with ingredients only other beer companies can dream of.  Any essential oil or substance that cannot mix in water or alcohol, Dr. Jekyll's can  brew with using its patented nano-encapsulation technology.

Well, try mixing flaxseed oil in beer....it doesn't mix and floats to the top.  We can do this. Pretty cool stuff, and the bioavailability of these nano-encapsulates is 500% greater than if you were to take a vitamin or gel cap.</p>
<p>We've been on the market for 2 1/2 years now and we've proven the concept, that being ""beer with benefits."" Its now time to build our own brewery and tasting room... and you can help! </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Dr. Jekyll’s was conceived in the heart of an old constable station turned brewery in Brattleboro, Vermont, by three longtime friends, united by their love of great beer and active, healthy lifestyles: <strong>Tom Costa</strong>, an avid home brewer and former paratrooper; his childhood friend <strong>Jimmy T</strong>, a scientist and all natural bodybuilder; and <strong>Ray McNeill</strong>, an award-winning master brewer.</p>
<p>After Ray suffered a serious health setback, these friends were inspired to craft beers that not only tasted great, but had something special about them, something with a greater purpose... and so was born, Dr. Jekyll’s…the world’s first and only, organic, non GMO, vegan, craft beer with health benefits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495946703/hmv1yyzpjsodcfwlwbtf.png"" src="""" style=""width: 456px;height: 324px;""/></p>
<h3>As Traditional As It Gets</h3>
<p><i>Did you know...?</i></p>
<p>The <strong>Egyptians</strong>, who invented beer, brewed with herbs, spices and other botanicals <strong>specifically for medicinal reasons<i>, </i></strong>so there you have it!  Dr. Jekyll’s beer is actually more authentic and traditional than beer brewed in accordance with the German Reinheitsgebot of 1516.  ""It was an important source of protein, minerals and vitamins and was so valuable, that beer jars were often used as a measurement of value, and was used in medicine."" source Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Yep, that's right, so any of you self anointed beer ""experts"" take note. Dr. Jekyll's is as real and traditional as it gets.  Organic is traditional?  You bettcha!  Back in the day, the Germans, Brits, Egyptians...whoever back then...didn't get on their soapbox yelling their beer was organic and pesticide free, non GMO (WTF is that?) or vegan...because it was NATURALLY, for cryin' out loud!!  Try this experiment...go to your local home brew store, buy non organic (pesticide laden) hops and malt, then buy some organic hops and malt, place both in separate pint glasses, steep with boiling hot water until it cools, and watch as the film on the surface of the pesticide laden crap forms....yummy....yep, have another pint of poison!</p>
<p>If you're gonna drink beer or anything for that matter, why not try and reduce the risk of damage and disease to your body by drinking organic and non GMO?  You might just add a few more beer drinking years to your life!</p>

<h3>Veteran Owned and Operated</h3>
<p>I have to be honest, I did not start the company with this in mind, that being veteran owned and operated, it kind of just happened, and now it's an important part of who we are as a company.  As for myself, I entered the military after graduating from West Point in 1987. I served with the famed 2nd Battalion 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division. Was mildly ""high speed"" earning my Ranger tab and becoming a Jumpmaster. But we have other ""bad asses"" on board, Marines who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, Army aviators, Navy guys and even an IED sniffing German Shepherd named Misty (okay, that's our dog, who was a rescue, but like to think she was a high speed Special Ops dog that went AWOL).</p>

<p>We even have <strong>Capt. Dale Dye </strong>on board. This guy is the bomb.  You will know him from movies like <i>Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers </i>and <i>The Pacific</i>. In fact, we <strong>have some cool PERKS </strong>that are tied into his upcoming movie <strong>No Better Place To Die </strong>which is in development. It's a World War II flick about my regiment, the paratroopers of the 2/505 Parachute Infantry Regiment and how they essentially saved D-Day!  It's very cool, and you have an opportunity to party with Dale and the cast, which will include some A-list actors.</p>

<p>Speaking of celebrities, <strong>Jorja Fox </strong>of <strong>CSI </strong>and <strong>ER </strong>fame, recently joined the Dr. Jekyll's team as an investor and is looking forward to being active with the company. She's a super cool, beer loving chick and a big animal rights advocate...as we all are at Dr. Jekyll's. In fact, we are ensuring any charities we donate to do not do animal testing.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Big ""HUUUGE"" Plans</strong></h3>
<p>I'm not going to bore you with our ""big plans"" but I will say this, Dr. Jekyll's has ""big plans."" I couldn't resist.  On a serious note, Dr. Jekyll's hopes to be a household name in the U.S. and even internationally someday, as the Dr. Jekyll's brand has wide appeal, since it is so incredibly unique, and frankly, it's where the market is heading...alcoholic libations with added health benefits.  <strong>Think Vitaminwater but for beer</strong>. And not just beer, but hard cider and nonalcoholic beer.  No one will be able to brew and infuse superfoods into beer, hard cider and nonalcoholic beer like Dr. Jekyll's because of our patented technology.  We have already been approached by parties and breweries oversees to license our brand and technology.  This is where I insert the video from <strong>Weird Science </strong>and <strong>Blin<strong>ded me </strong>with Science!</strong></p>

<h3>Use of Funds</h3>
<p>So let's face it, $100,000 is not going to cover all the costs associated with our brewery and tasting room.  It will be quite a a bit more. But...it will help us get things rolling, and we hope to exceed that number with all your donations.</p>
<p>The money will help to cover equipment down payments, a lease deposit, architectural designs, legal, leasehold improvements and project management.</p>
<p>We are also raising money the old fashion way, pimping my wife out. Just checking to see if anyone is still reading this far down. The old fashion way is through lenders and friends and family investors.</p>
<p>This gives you a chance to get some cool stuff and be a part of making this dream come alive.</p>
<p>If you cannot donate, please at least pass on as every share, like and reach around helps! By the way, did I say we all at Dr. Jekyll's have a sense of humor and like to have fun!</p>

<p>So with everything in life, there are risks and challenges.</p>
<p>Here is the deal. Even if we are not able to open this brewery and tasting room, you will still receive ALL perks that do not have an <strong>asterisk </strong>by it. If it does, that means you will only get that perk if the brewery and tasting room come to fruition, or in the case of the perks associated with the movie <strong>No Better Place To Die</strong>, you will only get that perk if the movie is made.

Our Story
Dr. Jekyll’s was conceived in the heart of an old constable station turned brewery in Brattleboro, Vermont, by three longtime friends, united by their love of great beer and active, healthy lifestyles: Tom Costa, an avid home brewer and former paratrooper; his childhood friend Jimmy T, a scientist and all natural bodybuilder; and Ray McNeill, an award-winning master brewer.
After Ray suffered a serious health setback, these friends were inspired to craft beers that not only tasted great, but had something special about them, something with a greater purpose... and so was born, Dr. Jekyll’s…the world’s first and only, organic, non GMO, vegan, craft beer with health benefits.
 

As Traditional As It Gets
Did you know...?
The Egyptians, who invented beer, brewed with herbs, spices and other botanicals specifically for medicinal reasons, so there you have it!  Dr. Jekyll’s beer is actually more authentic and traditional than beer brewed in accordance with the German Reinheitsgebot of 1516.  ""It was an important source of protein, minerals and vitamins and was so valuable, that beer jars were often used as a measurement of value, and was used in medicine."" source Wikipedia.
Yep, that's right, so any of you self anointed beer ""experts"" take note. Dr. Jekyll's is as real and traditional as it gets.  Organic is traditional?  You bettcha!  Back in the day, the Germans, Brits, Egyptians...whoever back then...didn't get on their soapbox yelling their beer was organic and pesticide free, non GMO (WTF is that?) or vegan...because it was NATURALLY, for cryin' out loud!!  Try this experiment...go to your local home brew store, buy non organic (pesticide laden) hops and malt, then buy some organic hops and malt, place both in separate pint glasses, steep with boiling hot water until it cools, and watch as the film on the surface of the pesticide laden crap forms....yummy....yep, have another pint of poison!
If you're gonna drink beer or anything for that matter, why not try and reduce the risk of damage and disease to your body by drinking organic and non GMO?  You might just add a few more beer drinking years to your life!

 
Yeah...but does it taste good?
Damn straight it does!  Our Spiced IPA, Dr. Jekyll's Bio Beer, won a Silver Medal at the Los Angeles International Beer Competition and our Kölsch, Dr. Jekyll's Beer Belly, won a Gold Medal at the same competition.

We've also had wonderful write-ups by critics and beer lovers.  We are different, and folks dig us. We've also been featured in Fortune magazine, Men's Fitness, Shape, Beer Connoisseur, Beverage Daily, Tasting Panel, LA Weekly, and many others, as well as being on CBS KTLA recently (see video below)

And not just beer, but hard cider and nonalcoholic beer.  No one will be able to brew and infuse superfoods into beer, hard cider and nonalcoholic beer like Dr. Jekyll's because of our patented technology.  We have already been approached by parties and breweries oversees to license our brand and technology.  This is where I insert the video from Weird Science and Blinded me with Science!

 

 

Use of Funds
So let's face it, $100,000 is not going to cover all the costs associated with our brewery and tasting room.  It will be quite a a bit more. But...it will help us get things rolling, and we hope to exceed that number with all your donations.
The money will help to cover equipment down payments, a lease deposit, architectural designs, legal, leasehold improvements and project management.
We are also raising money the old fashion way, pimping my wife out. Just checking to see if anyone is still reading this far down. The old fashion way is through lenders and friends and family investors.
This gives you a chance to get some cool stuff and be a part of making this dream come alive.
If you cannot donate, please at least pass on as every share, like and reach around helps! By the way, did I say we all at Dr. Jekyll's have a sense of humor and like to have fun!
 

 
Risks & Challenges
So with everything in life, there are risks and challenges.
Here is the deal. Even if we are not able to open this brewery and tasting room, you will still receive ALL perks that do not have an asterisk by it. If it does, that means you will only get that perk if the brewery and tasting room come to fruition, or in the case of the perks associated with the movie No Better Place To Die, you will only get that perk if the movie is made. Check out the you tube video on it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2f68xdXYrg

<p>In 2010 I started researching the world of rum and after working with an award winning master distiller, came up with the perfect blend of spices, fruits and botanicals.

<p>In the last 12 months we've taken this brand on the road in the UK and attended food and drink festivals sharing our brand with consumers and the feedback has been positive and energetic.</p>
<p>Last week Morant Bay won another award in the Global Spirit Masters for the Rum &amp; Cachaça Masters category. This win is timely as our rum celebrates it's second anniversary since it's launch.</p>

<p>Ceylon Tea is recognized as one of the best tea in the world due to its distinctive taste but also, and very few people know, due to its tea auction. This unique organization enforces that every single tea batch produced is tested, ensuring its quality and consistency in taste unlike other countries.</p>

<h3>What is Hospitality Gin?</h3>
<p>Hospitality Gin is a London Dry gin with a purpose.</p>
<p>We use 100% of our profits support the UK hospitality industry and its employees. We will do this until the COVID-19 pandemic is over.</p>
<p>Why the hospitality industry?</p>
<ul>
<li>The hospitality industry was hit first and hardest by the pandemic</li>
<li>It is likely to be the last sector allowed to reopen after the pandemic </li>
<li>Thousands of hospitality workers have already lost their jobs and livelihoods, despite Government support for businesses</li>
<li>Many venues are at risk of permanent closure</li>
</ul>
<p>Your donations will help provide Emergency Grants to those hit hardest, as well as fund mental health hotlines to help people through their darkest times.</p>
<p>Our founder, Tom, has worked in the hospitality industry for his entire working life, and has seen and heard first hand the devastation COVID-19 has had on people's lives. Hospitality Gin is a way to give back, and support those who need it. </p>
<h3>How Will The Profits Be Donated?</h3>
<p>100% of profits will be used to support the UK hospitality industry. The main two charities we will be donating to are The Drinks Trust and Hospitality Action, see below for more details. By minimising our overheads  and through the generosity of our partners, we will be donating between £4-6 of every bottle to charity. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">About The Charities</span></p>
<p>Hospitality Gin supports charities and causes that support the UK hospitality industry, both directly and indirectly. The two largest charities dedicated to hospitality workers are The Drinks Trust and Hospitality Action.</p>
<p>Between them, The Drinks Trust and Hospitality Action have paid over £750,000 of grants to workers who have lost earnings due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They are now shifting to helping members of the drinks industry to live mentally and physically healthy lives through the pandemic and beyond.</p>

<h3>About The Gin</h3>
<p>We've partnered with Cooper King Distillery in North Yorkshire to create an amazing London Dry gin. Made with honey from their own beehives, a touch of fresh lemon grass and locally grown lavender, it is equally as delicious over ice or in a tall, frosty G&amp;T.</p>
<p>By distilling in state-of-the-art glass vacuum stills, they can ensure that the distillation temperatures are tailored to suit each individual botanical, creating a gin with only the freshest, fullest flavours. Everything is is distilled by hand so the distillers artistry truly shines through.</p>
<p>Cooper King also have environmental credentials to be proud of. They run on 100% green energy and donate a minimum of 1% of all of their sales to environmental charity, the Yorkshire Dales Millennium Trust.</p>
<h3>Why Are We Running A Crowdfunding Campaign?</h3>
<p>All of the money raised up to our target will go towards paying for our first batch of gin, and making sure that it launches with the biggest splash possible. The more exposure we can get, the more money we can raise for those who need it. </p>
<p>Currently Tom is funding the entire project himself; he's investing his entire savings to purchase the first batch of gin, meaning there’s little left to do everything else. </p>
<p>What are the perks? </p>
<ul>
<li>EARLY BIRD OFFER!! The first 50 people to contribute £30 can claim a voucher at 10% off RRP</li>
<li>Contribute £33 to Hospitality Gin and we'll send you a voucher to claim a free bottle when we launch</li>
<li>Every backer can opt to receive a handwritten letter of thanks. Your contribution will help us to get the most money possible to those who need it most</li>
<li>Contribute £5 or more to suggest ingredients for our range of local gins. There's more on these just below</li>
<li>If you're feeling particularly thirsty then a contribution of £180 will get you a voucher for a FULL CASE (that's six bottles!) of Hospitality Gin when we launch. </li>
<li>Want to see where the magic happens? For a contribution of £2,500 you'll get a private tour of Cooper King Distillery for six when the pandemic and lockdown laws allow. You'll stay for two nights in the beautiful nearby Yorkshire countryside, and get a voucher for a bottle gin EACH to claim at the distillery, as well as one of our swanky t-shirts each.</li>
<li>A contribution of £7,500 gets you in on designing our first ""local"" gin. If you're not content with just submitting an an idea, and need to see your idea bottled then this is the perk for you. We'll work with you to create a viable flavour combination before liaising with Cooper King Distillery to start creating your concoction. Once the process is over (possibly after a few attempts) we'll bottle and sell your gin, with your name featuring on the label! You'll leave with a case (six bottles) of your brand new gin, and the satisfaction of knowing that your gin will be enjoyed all over the country, with every bottle supporting UK hospitality.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if we beat our target? That's where things get exciting! </p>
<p>We're planning to design and launch a range of ""local"" gins. These will be gins designed for individual cities or regions, using ingredients that are synonymous with them! For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sheffield's gin could include Yorkshire Tea and Henderson's Relish</li>
<li>Cornwall? Clotted cream!</li>
<li>Scrumpy cider from Bristol </li>
<li>The only limit is what we can distill!</li>
</ul>
<h3>About Tom</h3>
<p>Tom has spent his whole working life in the hospitality industry and has recently dedicated his time to advising hospitality workers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. He has worked tirelessly to ensure that useful information is accessible in an easily digestible format.</p>
<p>By sharing this information with a group of senior hospitality professionals with extensive social networks, tens of thousands hospitality professionals were kept up-to-date on the developing situation and its real world effects. Through this he became aware of how many members of the hospitality industry were left in precarious financial positions through no fault of their own.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, he was working on several projects which have been shelved for the time being, as well as working at FirePit Rocks in Sheffield City Centre. Tom was heavily involved in the developing the concept and brand of FirePit Rocks, and in return they continue to support him.</p>
<p>Tom’s motivation has always been to help those who need it, by freely sharing advice or best practice to those who need it, and in turn helping the local hospitality industry to grow. Now more than ever, we need to pull together to support those who need it most, and that is the rationale for founding Hospitality Gin.</p>
<p>Made by the Hospitality Industry, to support the Hospitality Industry.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What are the Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Hospitality Gin is a low risk project. Our first order is already with the distillery, so the brand will be launching regardless. We can guarantee that all perks will be fulfilled, even if we don't meet our fundraising target.</p>
<p>Our partners all have a wealth of experience in their fields and have been advising us every step of the way. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>This is a great cause, but I don't like gin...</h3>
<p>You can help in other ways! ALL of our profits will be going towards supporting the UK hospitality industry</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy a bottle for a friend who does! They get gin, and you get the warm fuzzy feeling of knowing you've helped someone in need.</li>
<li>Contribute without picking a perk, you'll be helping us get money to those who need it most</li>
<li>Let your friends who do love gin know about us by sharing our campaign on your social media channels. Indiegogo's share features will do all the hard work for you! </li>

Hospitality Gin supports charities and causes that support the UK hospitality industry, both directly and indirectly. The two largest charities dedicated to hospitality workers are The Drinks Trust and Hospitality Action.
Between them, The Drinks Trust and Hospitality Action have paid over £750,000 of grants to workers who have lost earnings due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They are now shifting to helping members of the drinks industry to live mentally and physically healthy lives through the pandemic and beyond.


About The Gin
We've partnered with Cooper King Distillery in North Yorkshire to create an amazing London Dry gin. Made with honey from their own beehives, a touch of fresh lemon grass and locally grown lavender, it is equally as delicious over ice or in a tall, frosty G&T.
By distilling in state-of-the-art glass vacuum stills, they can ensure that the distillation temperatures are tailored to suit each individual botanical, creating a gin with only the freshest, fullest flavours. Everything is is distilled by hand so the distillers artistry truly shines through.
Cooper King also have environmental credentials to be proud of. They run on 100% green energy and donate a minimum of 1% of all of their sales to environmental charity, the Yorkshire Dales Millennium Trust.
Why Are We Running A Crowdfunding Campaign?
All of the money raised up to our target will go towards paying for our first batch of gin, and making sure that it launches with the biggest splash possible. The more exposure we can get, the more money we can raise for those who need it. 
Currently Tom is funding the entire project himself; he's investing his entire savings to purchase the first batch of gin, meaning there’s little left to do everything else. 
What are the perks? 

EARLY BIRD OFFER!! The first 50 people to contribute £30 can claim a voucher at 10% off RRP
Contribute £33 to Hospitality Gin and we'll send you a voucher to claim a free bottle when we launch
Every backer can opt to receive a handwritten letter of thanks. Your contribution will help us to get the most money possible to those who need it most
Contribute £5 or more to suggest ingredients for our range of local gins. There's more on these just below
If you're feeling particularly thirsty then a contribution of £180 will get you a voucher for a FULL CASE (that's six bottles!) of Hospitality Gin when we launch. 
Want to see where the magic happens? For a contribution of £2,500 you'll get a private tour of Cooper King Distillery for six when the pandemic and lockdown laws allow. You'll stay for two nights in the beautiful nearby Yorkshire countryside, and get a voucher for a bottle gin EACH to claim at the distillery, as well as one of our swanky t-shirts each.
A contribution of £7,500 gets you in on designing our first ""local"" gin. If you're not content with just submitting an an idea, and need to see your idea bottled then this is the perk for you. We'll work with you to create a viable flavour combination before liaising with Cooper King Distillery to start creating your concoction. Once the process is over (possibly after a few attempts) we'll bottle and sell your gin, with your name featuring on the label! You'll leave with a case (six bottles) of your brand new gin, and the satisfaction of knowing that your gin will be enjoyed all over the country, with every bottle supporting UK hospitality.

And if we beat our target? That's where things get exciting! 
We're planning to design and launch a range of ""local"" gins. These will be gins designed for individual cities or regions, using ingredients that are synonymous with them! For example:

Sheffield's gin could include Yorkshire Tea and Henderson's Relish
Cornwall? Clotted cream!
Scrumpy cider from Bristol 
The only limit is what we can distill!

About Tom
Tom has spent his whole working life in the hospitality industry and has recently dedicated his time to advising hospitality workers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. He has worked tirelessly to ensure that useful information is accessible in an easily digestible format.
By sharing this information with a group of senior hospitality professionals with extensive social networks, tens of thousands hospitality professionals were kept up-to-date on the developing situation and its real world effects. Through this he became aware of how many members of the hospitality industry were left in precarious financial positions through no fault of their own.
Prior to the pandemic, he was working on several projects which have been shelved for the time being, as well as working at FirePit Rocks in Sheffield City Centre. Tom was heavily involved in the developing the concept and brand of FirePit Rocks, and in return they continue to support him.
Tom’s motivation has always been to help those who need it, by freely sharing advice or best practice to those who need it, and in turn helping the local hospitality industry to grow. Now more than ever, we need to pull together to support those who need it most, and that is the rationale for founding Hospitality Gin.
Made by the Hospitality Industry, to support the Hospitality Industry.

What are the Risks & Challenges
Hospitality Gin is a low risk project. Our first order is already with the distillery, so the brand will be launching regardless. We can guarantee that all perks will be fulfilled, even if we don't meet our fundraising target.
Our partners all have a wealth of experience in their fields and have been advising us every step of the way. 

This is a great cause, but I don't like gin...
You can help in other ways! ALL of our profits will be going towards supporting the UK hospitality industry

Buy a bottle for a friend who does! They get gin, and you get the warm fuzzy feeling of knowing you've helped someone in need.
Contribute without picking a perk, you'll be helping us get money to those who need it most
Let your friends who do love gin know about us by sharing our campaign on your social media channels. Indiegogo's share features will do all the hard work for you!

<h3>Short Story</h3>
<p>Hey, I'm Chef Philip from the Philippines! I love cooking with a wide variety of ingredients, techniques, flavors, and textures and I believe cooking brings people together. I worked in the culinary arts field for 15 years in the beautiful city of San Diego, but I recently moved back to my hometown, Ridgecrest, CA, to start my own culinary business. I like to keep things simple, so I opened up Bebe's Lumpia to share my family recipe. Unfortunately we only have a food tent and can only do events like the Ridgecrest Farmer's Market on Saturdays. If we have a food trailer then we can be available more days of the week and work with more business owners and it will be easier to set up on our windy days the wind can go up to 30 mph sometimes . A lot of our guests ask ""How about the weekdays"" or "" Where is your restaurant in town"" and I say ""We don't have one yet, but soon."" That is why we are raising $40,000 for the truck, license, permit, marketing, and all other California fees. With your help we can spend more days sharing our family recipe and kindness as cooking brings people together. Have a beautiful day!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chef Philip from the Philippines was born in Cebu City, Philippines on September 23, 1985. When he was two years old his family moved to California, United States of America. He grew up in a small town called Ridgecrest; Life there was easy living with a wonderful community. He loved to skateboard and breakdance with friends and family. After high school Chef Philip wondered what he was going to do. He thought about his family and how they love to cook and invite people into their homes. He loved the concept that cooking brings people together, so he moved to San Diego, CA to pursue a career in culinary arts. After graduating from school, he worked with some amazing chefs in restaurants like Bodi in Downtown San Diego and Season 52 in La Jolla. He wanted to do his own thing, now he is building a culinary business in his hometown.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>This campaign is very important because with a food tent we are limited to work with businesses that require high permit fees and strict regulations due to COVID and right now we cant do the farmer market because we don't have a food trailer, but with a food trailer we can bypass the high permit fees, participate in more local events, and work with more business owners to open up our weekly availability. </li>
<li>The magnitude of help from contributors will be bigger than words can describe because it will lead to unlimited opportunities; More capital to achieve our goal leads to more sharing of our family recipes and kindness. </li>

If we have a food trailer then we can be available more days of the week and work with more business owners and it will be easier to set up on our windy days the wind can go up to 30 mph sometimes . A lot of our guests ask ""How about the weekdays"" or "" Where is your restaurant in town"" and I say ""We don't have one yet, but soon."" That is why we are raising $40,000 for the truck, license, permit, marketing, and all other California fees. With your help we can spend more days sharing our family recipe and kindness as cooking brings people together. Have a beautiful day!  
 
Chef Philip from the Philippines was born in Cebu City, Philippines on September 23, 1985. When he was two years old his family moved to California, United States of America. He grew up in a small town called Ridgecrest; Life there was easy living with a wonderful community. He loved to skateboard and breakdance with friends and family. After high school Chef Philip wondered what he was going to do. He thought about his family and how they love to cook and invite people into their homes. He loved the concept that cooking brings people together, so he moved to San Diego, CA to pursue a career in culinary arts. After graduating from school, he worked with some amazing chefs in restaurants like Bodi in Downtown San Diego and Season 52 in La Jolla. He wanted to do his own thing, now he is building a culinary business in his hometown.
 

This campaign is very important because with a food tent we are limited to work with businesses that require high permit fees and strict regulations due to COVID and right now we cant do the farmer market because we don't have a food trailer, but with a food trailer we can bypass the high permit fees, participate in more local events, and work with more business owners to open up our weekly availability. 
The magnitude of help from contributors will be bigger than words can describe because it will lead to unlimited opportunities; More capital to achieve our goal leads to more sharing of our family recipes and kindness. 


What We Need & What You Get
We are raising $40,000 for the food truck, license, permit, marketing, and supplies:

Food Truck= $35,000
License and Permit= $4,000
Marketing and Supplies=$1,000

<p>This is our continued campaign to raise the funds for Missoula's first Pakistani food truck. Thus far we have been able to raise close to $12,000 (after fees), which would all be used towards the purchase of the food truck. Any additional funds raised through this attempt, would be added to the original amount. As most food trailers start from about $25,000, we hope to raise enough funds to at least acquire the most important and expensive equipment to start operation. </p>
<p>We have also been in contact with local media outlets, and we hope the exposure from that would help spread the word and get the community to chip in to help bring this dream to fruition. I recently taught an online Zoom class through United We Eat and had some great feedback from the amazing home cooks.  We are hopeful the enthusiasm in the community helps us reach our goal.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Zohair Bajwa. I was born and raised in Lahore, Pakistan, and have been in Missoula since 2006. My friends and family will all tell you how much I enjoy sharing my culture through food – sharing the distinct tastes and smells of home with the people I love. Because of this, I have decided to embark on a new, exciting, and delicious endeavor – bringing the tastes of authentic Pakistani food to the Missoula community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope to bring Lahore’s authentic street food to the streets of Missoula and the surrounding area. My wife Megan and I are looking into securing a food trailer in which to prepare and serve up some delicious Pakistani food to tantalize your taste buds and keep you coming back for more. This is where your support and generosity comes in, and please allow me to thank you up front.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Community and Food</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ever since I came to Missoula in 2006 as a student at the University of Montana, there has always been something missing for me – good curries, and, more specifically, Pakistani food.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was deeply honored to have the chance to cook for my community through the United We Eat (“UWE”) program through Soft Landing Missoula last year. It was such a humbling experience – to see the excitement the Missoula community displayed for authentic Pakistani food. We ended up selling out 150 meals!</p>
<p><a href=""https://bit.ly/2YY7Y25"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://bit.ly/2YY7Y25</a></p>
<p><a href=""https://bit.ly/2IrA0xs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://bit.ly/2IrA0xs</a></p>
<p>I plan to bring the same love and passion to my food trailer as I did for the UWE program, and you can expect no compromises when it comes to using authentic spices and recipes, resulting in a whole new world of flavors for you to enjoy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eventually, once we are up and running and have firm footing in the Missoula food scene, we plan to give back to our Missoula neighbors, either by specials or discounted/free meals for various ones in the community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What Foods to Expect</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Megan and I have had several conversations about a menu we believe would best bring the tastes of Lahore to the people of Missoula. During our trip home earlier this year, we explored different flavors that we think would work best to introduce to our community here. We will initially be serving:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chicken Karahi: traditionally cooked in a wok with tomatoes and spices, simmered to a thick sauce. Served best with naan and kachumar* (keto-friendly)</p>
<p>Daal: orange lentils perfectly cooked to a stew-like consistency. Prepared with spices and served best over rice or naan (vegan, vegetarian friendly)</p>
<p>Samosa: everyone knows about these delicious, fried concoctions!</p>
<p>Paratha Rolls: a traditional grab-and-go street food from Pakistan. Chicken or vegetables cooked in spices, mixed with kachumar*, mint and tamarind chutneys, wrapped in a crispy paratha (fry bread).</p>
<p>Shakar Qandi: My wife’s favorite snack in Lahore! Sweet potato mixed with freshly squeezed orange and spices. Traditionally served over newspaper (we won’t be doing that here, obviously – hello health code violation), and toothpicks.</p>
<p>*Kachumar: sliced raw onions, raw tomatoes mixed with fresh lemon/lime juice, cilantro, salt and black pepper. A perfect accompaniment to any of the above-listed meals.</p>
<p>Chutneys: Spicy mint chutney and a sweet and tangy tamarind chutney.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What You Get for Helping Fund This Project</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Besides having a local spot where you can try the delicious tastes of traditional and authentic Pakistani food, adding to Missoula’s food and cultural diversity, you can expect the listed rewards.</p>
<p>For any donations received from outside of Missoula area and if you cannot visit us when we're open, we will do our best to get your T-shirts mailed to you as soon we are able to. Also, if and when you're in Missoula, please come say hi and we will take care of you the only way we know- Pakistani hospitality style. For catering donations, we can certainly schedule a date where you will be in Missoula and would like to take advantage of that perk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Risks and Challenges</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Obviously, there is always a risk of failure, and to be honest, that risk is part of the reason why I have shied away from this endeavor until now. But I believe now is the time to make my dream a reality – now is the time for Missoula to experience authentic Pakistani food that is rich in flavor, made with love, and warms the soul.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During these extraordinary times in which we find ourselves, I understand that not everyone is able to contribute financially to this project. However, I would be very thankful for your support, encouragement, and patronage when we do open. I hope the people of Missoula are as excited as Megan and I are for this project, and I hope you will show your support by opening your hearts and your wallets to make this a success and help us add something new to your dining options!</p>

<h2>Proper Cookie Dough | Powered By Plants </h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>No matter your dietary restriction, lifestyle or palate; you can enjoy a Proper Cookie. 12 ounces of ooey-gooey, satiating deliciousness packed with all things good (Antioxidants, Superfoods, fiber, protein and chocolate). Enjoy all 4 flavors of our cookie dough, available in (12 cookies per jar): Chocolate Chipper, Snickerdoodle, Triple Chocolate and Sugar Cookie. </p>
<h3>WHAT IS IN YOUR DOUGH?</h3>
<p>We take our ingredients seriously and are working with food scientists and nutritionists to create the perfect plant-based cookie. </p>
<p>While our dough is currently in research/development and will be a modified version of our current ingredient list, we've decided that these ingredients take top priority:</p>
<p>Organic, Non-Gmo, Allergen Free..Always </p>
<p> Sorghum Flour: It contains antioxidants like policosanols and a single serving of sorghum contains 48% of your recommended daily intake of Fiber. </p>
<p> Oat Flour: Organic Oat Flour is rich in iron, zinc, and protein. It’s also a treasure chest of minerals and a good source of vitamins B1 and B3.</p>
<p> Butterfly Pea Flower (dye): It is traditionally used for its anti-aging benefits in Southeast Asia. It is also known as a memory enhancer, rich source of antioxidants and known for eye health and hormonal support. It also contains Proanthocyanidins which enhance the collagen production of skin cells.</p>
<p>Ingredients currently in our dough: Brown/White Rice Flour, Guar Gum, Arrowroot Starch, Tapioca Starch, Coconut oil (refined to have NO ALLERGENS, also no 7S and 11S globulins)* Sustainable Palm Fruit Oil, Sunflower Oil, Baking Powder, Vegan Cane Sugar, Apples, Vanilla Extract and Sea Salt.  </p>
<p>* We WILL NOT use Allergen Free Coconut Oil in Proper 2.0</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All Natural Plant Based Dyes</p>
<p>Snickerdoodle Cookie Dough</p>
<p>Why We Decided To Go Allergen Free </p>
<h3>#CookiesForAll</h3>
<p>Researchers estimate that 32 million Americans have food allergies, including 5.6 million children under age 18. That’s one in 13 children, or roughly two in every classroom.</p>
<p>About 40 percent of children with food allergies are allergic to more than one food.</p>
<p>After years spent in professional kitchens, we learned one thing; Americans are Allergic As Fudge. As we developed the Proper recipe, we noticed interesting things about what was already on the market. A LOT of the cookie doughs were only Bakeable or just edible, maybe Vegan but not Corn Free. And from our own experiences (with family members having food allergies), we knew that if you have one food allergy, you could have several more. It didn't make sense that with so many cookie options, there wasn't one that everyone could eat.</p> <h3>Help Us Grow </h3>
<p>The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement were founded in part to target practices that threaten climate stability and ecosystem resilience. Both groups have determined that we require an agricultural revolution that is based in sustainable practices and implementation of system wide innovation.</p>
<p>Proper was created to have an impact on that food system and consumer's relationship with plant-based foods, specifically desserts. Our efforts will need a Kickstart of $10,000 to produce a sustainable recipe that's hard to compete with. WE DO NOT USE ALMONDS IN OUR DOUGH.</p>
<p>The funds will help support our R&amp;D and Commercialization efforts. We want to scale down our recipe and take out ingredients that may be adding too much sugar and sodium to it’s makeup. (see our current ingredient list below)</p>
<p>Our biggest goal with a recipe development lab is to add at least 3g of Fiber and 3g of Protein without affecting the taste that won over our earliest customers. </p>
<p>Funds will also be used for a logistics consultant to ensure that every order of cookie dough is delivered ice cold to your doorstep, at the lowest cost possible. This'll allow us to offer Nationwide shipping at affordable pricing and aid in our efforts to make Allergen-Free dough accessible for everyone. </p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks: miscalculation of costs, production waste, logistics etc. But we are taking measures to minimize these risks. We have a team of individuals helping us source some of the best consultants in logistics, nutrition, and commercialization. We promise to be transparent throughout the campaign to deliver a cookie you'll be satisfied with.</p>

 Sorghum Flour: It contains antioxidants like policosanols and a single serving of sorghum contains 48% of your recommended daily intake of Fiber. 
 Oat Flour: Organic Oat Flour is rich in iron, zinc, and protein. It’s also a treasure chest of minerals and a good source of vitamins B1 and B3.
 Butterfly Pea Flower (dye): It is traditionally used for its anti-aging benefits in Southeast Asia. It is also known as a memory enhancer, rich source of antioxidants and known for eye health and hormonal support. It also contains Proanthocyanidins which enhance the collagen production of skin cells.
Ingredients currently in our dough: Brown/White Rice Flour, Guar Gum, Arrowroot Starch, Tapioca Starch, Coconut oil (refined to have NO ALLERGENS, also no 7S and 11S globulins)* Sustainable Palm Fruit Oil, Sunflower Oil, Baking Powder, Vegan Cane Sugar, Apples, Vanilla Extract and Sea Salt.  
* We WILL NOT use Allergen Free Coconut Oil in Proper 2.0
 
All Natural Plant Based Dyes
Snickerdoodle Cookie Dough
Why We Decided To Go Allergen Free 
#CookiesForAll
Researchers estimate that 32 million Americans have food allergies, including 5.6 million children under age 18. That’s one in 13 children, or roughly two in every classroom.
About 40 percent of children with food allergies are allergic to more than one food.
After years spent in professional kitchens, we learned one thing; Americans are Allergic As Fudge. As we developed the Proper recipe, we noticed interesting things about what was already on the market. A LOT of the cookie doughs were only Bakeable or just edible, maybe Vegan but not Corn Free. And from our own experiences (with family members having food allergies), we knew that if you have one food allergy, you could have several more. It didn't make sense that with so many cookie options, there wasn't one that everyone could eat. Help Us Grow 
The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement were founded in part to target practices that threaten climate stability and ecosystem resilience. Both groups have determined that we require an agricultural revolution that is based in sustainable practices and implementation of system wide innovation.
Proper was created to have an impact on that food system and consumer's relationship with plant-based foods, specifically desserts. Our efforts will need a Kickstart of $10,000 to produce a sustainable recipe that's hard to compete with. WE DO NOT USE ALMONDS IN OUR DOUGH.
The funds will help support our R&D and Commercialization efforts. We want to scale down our recipe and take out ingredients that may be adding too much sugar and sodium to it’s makeup. (see our current ingredient list below)
Our biggest goal with a recipe development lab is to add at least 3g of Fiber and 3g of Protein without affecting the taste that won over our earliest customers. 
Funds will also be used for a logistics consultant to ensure that every order of cookie dough is delivered ice cold to your doorstep, at the lowest cost possible. This'll allow us to offer Nationwide shipping at affordable pricing and aid in our efforts to make Allergen-Free dough accessible for everyone. 
Risks and challenges
There are always risks: miscalculation of costs, production waste, logistics etc. But we are taking measures to minimize these risks. We have a team of individuals helping us source some of the best consultants in logistics, nutrition, and commercialization. We promise to be transparent throughout the campaign to deliver a cookie you'll be satisfied with.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The idea behind the creation of this drink is very simple.After being constantly ill with colds on a weekly basis, I've noticed a  cycle, the more medication I took, the worse I felt. My immune system was crashing. I was very close to becoming a diabetic, I was fainting from the rapid change in my blood sugar levels or had moments where I couldn't even keep my eyes open.</p>
<p>After researching for a medications alternatives I've found turmeric and golden milk and I was surprised with the benefits of having it.</p>
<p>Within the first week, I've noticed the changes: my skin was looking healthier and had a glow, my immune system got stronger, and I didn't have a cold since. My stomach was better than ever and, most importantly, my blood sugar levels went from 37 to 32 in just a few weeks. All of that because of the amazing turmeric and ginger.</p>
<p>I started making the drink for friends and colleagues and slowly became an ambassador for it. Some of the people who've tried it said that the taste is very strong and even if it had benefits on their health they wouldn't have it because of the particular turmeric taste. This made me think how can I make this drink better for everyone? I've started experimenting with different fruits and spices, and finally, found a taste that everyone loved and the idea of Pura Vita was born.</p>
<p>This campaign will help us not only to raise the money we need to start manufacturing but will also bring more awareness to the people, help them focus on their health and bring more knowledge about the alternatives to the medications that we all take without even thinking about their side effects.</p>

<p>I have been cooking back since my early teens. The passion of creation is what makes me the ""COOK"" I am.</p>
<p>12 years ago, while owning a small diner in North Carolina, I was introduced and schooled on the Art of making great BBQ. It is about taking the time to make the meat work, and marrying it with a sauce that compliments, NOT covers the taste of the meats.</p>
<p>Ten years later, I am back at it. And using the sauce I developed in North Carolina, my customers in New Mexico have never tasted the blend of ingredients that I am so passionate about. One small modification to the original sauce...is the use of New Mexico Chile Peppers.</p>
<p>All backers will receive a 16 ounce bottle of my All Natural 'custom' sauce. It is fabulous on any meat, and even on grilled OR raw vegetables. I have some friends that use it as a Salad Dressing.</p>

<h3>Popped Culture popcorn. Our popped products.</h3>
<p>We pop and sell sweet, artisan popcorn with unique flavor combinations. Our tasty popcorn snacks come wrapped in pop art designed by local artists and adorned with witty, pop culture names like Godfather's Garlic Parm, Spicy Lime Hot Mess, Coconut Lime Baewatch, and American Apple Pie. (We hear Stiffler's mom approves.)</p>
<h3>The POP Academy. More than popping and selling popcorn.</h3>
<p>Our curriculum teaches students analytical, interpersonal, and leadership skills in a web-based forum. Mentor feedback on the job validates key employment traits meaning mentees graduate ready for thriving wage employment, a greater focus on continuing education, and the support they need to succeed in business.</p>

<p>This covers  a popcorn popper ($5,000), hand washing and dishwashing sinks plus install ($2,000), and a farmer's market style booth in Philadelphia ($3,000). Having built our first popcorn stand by hand, I know that this gives us the resources we need to build a bare bones place.</p>

</div></div>","Poppin' with a purpose. One kernel at a time.
Popped Culture is a social enterprise. We pop and sell sweet, artisan popcorn with unique flavor combinations to support youth development.
Each young POPerator gets paid to sell their popped products directly to customers, to businesses, and to shoppers online while they learn business and life skills through our POPrietary POP Academy.
With your help we can grow our impact throughout Pennsylvania.

Meet our POPrietor. The popcorn kid.
Mark R. Wieder, Esq. is the owner and sole POPrietor of Popped Culture. Mark left his career as an attorney to get things poppin' elsewhere! Leaving in search of passion and purpose in his life, he now helps local youths tackle the problems they face at home with the help of foreign concepts he learned abroad. 
Popped Culture popcorn. Our popped products.
We pop and sell sweet, artisan popcorn with unique flavor combinations. Our tasty popcorn snacks come wrapped in pop art designed by local artists and adorned with witty, pop culture names like Godfather's Garlic Parm, Spicy Lime Hot Mess, Coconut Lime Baewatch, and American Apple Pie. (We hear Stiffler's mom approves.)
The POP Academy. More than popping and selling popcorn.
Our curriculum teaches students analytical, interpersonal, and leadership skills in a web-based forum. Mentor feedback on the job validates key employment traits meaning mentees graduate ready for thriving wage employment, a greater focus on continuing education, and the support they need to succeed in business.

Investing in opportunity youth between the ages of 14 and 24 unlocks an enormous potential for the economy while starting a ripple effect for future generations.

We set up the upcoming generation ready to enter the workplace with shoulder-to-shoulder skills that will land them in living-wage positions, reducing their likelihood for government assistance, or taking to the streets for additional income.
Growing POPerations. What we need.
Our goal is to raise $10,000 to put towards our growing POPerations.
This covers  a popcorn popper ($5,000), hand washing and dishwashing sinks plus install ($2,000), and a farmer's market style booth in Philadelphia ($3,000). Having built our first popcorn stand by hand, I know that this gives us the resources we need to build a bare bones place.

However, the more you donate, the more you can help make our space sweet with fun artwork and goodies.

Our stretch goal is $20,000. We'll use these proceeds to build a stand, and we'll work with Lancaster's local Amish community building a rockin', poppin' Amish popcorn buggy.
Our second stretch goal is $30,000, which will allow us to unlock an augment realty experience where our physical buggy, badges, and stands come to life digitally on your phone through an app.
We've put together a slew of fun, limited edition perks and a first release product to reach our goals.
Featuring: limited edition merchandise from local artists and artisans.
Our limited edition perks include a set of three 1.5 inch numbered enamel buttons; a pop art inspired t-shirt; and a signed, numbered, screen-printed-by-hand, color poster by local artist Stephen Michael Haas. Stephen developed our logo, painted an out-of-this-world mural at our stand, and adorned our trailer with ""Popcorn Kisses.""

I’ve been in the wine and spirits business for 18 years, successfully making and marketing products and brands for others. From the first time I went back to Ireland and heard the story of my ""Dinger Lynch"" family, I knew one day I would make my own craft spirit, just like my family before me. That day is here, and my family and I need your help to launch The Dinger Poitín.</p><p>When I was told I was part of ""The Dinger Lynchs,"" I asked where the name came from. As it was explained to me, back in the day in rural parts of County Clare, Ireland, if you’re the best at something, you were sometimes referred to as “The Dinger.” And that’s when I started to hear statements like, “Your people were the dinger at poitín-making,” and “Your family’s poitín was the dinger!”</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569438437/b64fmzs1hnqwbluuepay.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Historical photo of rural poitín-makers.</i></p><p>It turns out poitín (pronounced po-cheen) is the name for the world’s first craft spirit – the original unaged whiskey first made in Ireland by monks nearly 1400 years ago.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My wife Kayla and I formed Harbinger Beer Company in 2017 after purchasing two old store fronts in Downtown Caddo, Ok.  It was an easy decision for us to restore these old buildings instead of starting from scratch.  We love to breath new life into anything we can restore and these buildings needed and still need a lot of TLC.  This is not only about having a building to house our business, but just as much about revitalizing Downtown Caddo.  With your contribution we will do great things.</p>
<p>You can watch us in the video above as we gather bricks for this campaign nearly two years ago as we were prepping for construction.  You can see where we started and the shape of our building at the time. The overlay image before the video is of the taproom a few months ago. See other photos of our renovation on our facebook page here <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/harbingerbeer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/harbingerbeer/</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would like to reach a goal of $7500 to put toward finishing out our taproom and outdoor sitting area at the front of the building.  The town of Caddo has given us permission to extend 7ft onto the sidewalk for our covered outdoor seating and rod iron fencing.  To meet our goal of $7500 we only need 150 contributor at $50, and we have way more bricks than that ready for the engraver.</p>
<p>With your contribution of $50 you will receive an engraved brick that will go into the construction of the taproom and columns of the outdoor sitting area.  Space is limited, but we would like to see names on every brick!  The engraved brick can have up to two names and  or family name.  In memory of bricks are also welcome. Let us bring Caddo back to life one brick at a time.</p>
<p>Once we get rolling, Brick in the Wall members will also be included in special exclusive deals in the taproom as they are announced.  Not only do you get to be a part of the brick and mortar (literally) but you can get a return on investment through taproom savings, so don't miss this opportunity!</p>
<p>We would love to meet or exceed this goal. Any overages will stay in the construction fund and will be used on outward facing public areas of our property to beautify the town.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We hope that we can impact others and they too can see the beauty of these historic buildings and possibly encourage other businesses or individuals to take advantage and bring other buildings back to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have met many challenges on our journey to open our nano-brewery, but none that we could not overcome.  If we do not reach or exceed our goal, the funds that are raised will still be used in construction moving forward.</p>

<h3>Organic, fresh roasted coffee benefiting local artists</h3>
<p>Waldo's &amp; Company is a non-profit arts organization focused on providing low cost art equipment to local artists and a space to engage with our creative community. Alongside being a local art hub, we've also been roasting and brewing some of the best coffee in the area since the very beginning of our organization.  A lot of people's first interaction with our space is stopping by to get a freshly brewed cup of coffee, which we continue to offer for donations only. These donations and the proceeds from selling our whole bean coffee have become central to our operations. In fact, the money that we make from coffee sales is one of the main ways that we pay our overhead costs (rent, insurance, utilities, etc), so that we can keep access to our space affordable for artists. </p>
<p>We started roasting coffee back in 2013 on a tiny, out-of-date roaster which is only capable of roasting 6 lbs an hour. Over the past few years, demand for our coffee beans has grown and we are now desperately in need of upgrading to a more efficient roaster. We've got our eyes on a cute little roaster that can crank out 25 lbs an hour, which will be more than enough to handle our needs for years to come.</p>
<p>By giving to this project, you'll be helping to ensure low cost access to art equipment in Gettysburg for years to come, as well as getting amazing coffee for a year!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need to raise $8000.00 to buy a roaster that can efficiently handle our roasting needs.

<p>We hope to fund this purchase almost entirely through whole bean coffee subscriptions.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>You get a coffee subscription for fresh roasted, organic coffee that benefits local artists.</p>
<p>You can choose how many pounds of coffee you'd like to receive on a monthly basis and whether you'd like to pick it up from Waldo's or have it delivered to your door. Each subscription lasts one year, starting in January 2021. </p>
<p>We also have a few other coffee related items that you can choose or add to your subscription.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By choosing to buy your coffee from Waldo's, you'll be helping us greatly increase our coffee roasting capabilities which will in turn greatly increase our ability to provide local artists with the resources they need to thrive. We've built a community of folks that are passionate about the arts, community, and great coffee. We'd like to see this continue to grow for many years to come.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>There's a new sports drink in town...and she's got game.</h3>
<p>How many hydration and sports drinks have YOU consumed in <strong><u>your</u></strong> lifetime?  I recently had to ask myself the same thing.</p>
<p>Well, between my NCAA Championship college basketball career at The University of Texas to my professional career with the WNBA Champion Houston Comets &amp; Utah Starzz, to my USA National and Olympic team experiences, to my international professional careers in Italy and Switzerland -- I'm guessing I've consumed at least 25,000 gallons of sports drinks and hydration beverages.  I stopped counting a long time ago.</p>
<p>My name's Fran Harris (purple/pink blouse in the photo below) and given my extensive sports background, you might think that the idea for Electra hydration &amp; sports drinks was born 10 or more years ago...but it wasn't.    </p>

<p>I was volunteering for a 5K and saw a trio of folks who looked like they could use some encouragement early in the race, so I decided to run/walk with them. Ya know, to show solidarity. It's always felt great to be a part of something bigger than I am -- and to support a great cause at the same time. </p>
<p>But within a few minutes of ""supporting"" these eager beaver runners, it became respiratorily apparent, to me at least, that not only had I NOT trained for this 5K, but that I also had no idea how I was going to tell them that I was a basketball player -- not a semi-long distance runner -- and that I was about to make a U-turn and head back to the snack table. </p>
<p>By this time, my new friends were feeding off of my early enthusiasm and now apparently wanted me to continue running with them the ENTIRE 3.2 miles. It's at that point when I said, ""Welp, looks like you guys can take it from here."" </p>
<p>Then, I attempted to walk off the trail.</p>
<p><strong>""Nooooooo,"" the three of them said in unison. ""You can't leave now. You're on our team"" </strong></p>
<p>I am? I thought. Instead, I smiled and kept run-walking. ""Right,"" I said, trying to catch my breath. ""Go team"".</p>
<p>About 37 minutes later as we were crossing the finish line, someone rushed over to hand me a bottle of a popular sports drink -- because I'm sure I looked like I needed it. </p>
<p>As she screwed the top off of the plastic bottle, a funny thing happened. For some reason, just as I was about to chug it down, I looked at the nutrition panel. WOW. </p>
<p>I couldn't believe my eyes.  I'd been drinking this stuff most of my college and professional careers - and honestly, I had never paid a whole lot of attention to the ingredients. What I saw actually horrified me. </p>
<p><strong>That day, Electra was born.  </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596425039/rhyghdnpn8cawtmk2orf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>That day, I made a commitment to build an iconic brand,</strong> led by best-for-you, functional hydration drinks that moms could feel good about giving their kids, everyday hustlers could drink throughout their day, and athletes could consume with confidence -- knowing that it was fuel for them.</p>
<p>A week later, I hired a CPG (consumer packaged goods) advisor who helped lead a beverage company from $30 to $70 million in three years. </p>
<p>Because I'd worked in sales and retail for Procter &amp; Gamble, selling consumer packaged goods, I was familiar with the world of selling food, beverages and health &amp; beauty. That experience was, and is still, a big plus. After I committed to launching Electra I had to figure out exactly what I wanted this new company -- and this first product -- to be. I went to work on hiring a team of outstanding CPG experts who I could contract to help me take Electra from idea to innovation to reality. </p>

<p>First stop? <strong>Survey the marketplace.</strong> My time at P&amp;G had taught me the importance of market research. Data was everything, and we all know numbers never lie. Research showed that the sports drink category is ripe for growth. Projected to be a $23 billion dollar industry by the end of 2020 (those were pre-COVID-19 estimates, by the way). Source: Statista.com</p>
<p>The results of the survey provided critical data to move forward. <strong>43% of our respondents said they'd try a new sports drink and possibly switch from their current brand if there were a great tasting</strong>, better for you option on the market. BOOM! </p>
<h2><strong>Next step? Formulating the product. </strong></h2>
<p>It had to be better than good. <strong>It needed to be AMAZING</strong>. I reached out to my food and beverage network to get recommendations for the best formulators in the world and I definitely found a gem. It was so much fun describing how Electra might taste to Jaime. Within weeks we had our first crack at Electra.  It was actually happening. I could not believe it. And it was so exciting when these three bottles below arrived for tasting and testing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596384152/c3xcr9oba6h9ozujwtx8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>After many rounds of focus groups, testing, feedback and learning, we had our formulation -- and our 3 skus - Passion Punch, Litty Lemonade &amp; Oh Yeah! Orange.</strong></p>
<p>So, what's inside the bottle? Electra is curated from the best nature has to offer.  It starts with electrolyte-rich organic watermelon water and coconut water concentrate. Then we added a potent blend of vitamins B, C, and D and amino acids to give you energy to get through your day, task or workout. But wait there's more -- it has ZERO added sugar, no artificial colors or flavors, and one 16 oz bottle has a third of the calories of our top competitors.  But best of all -- Electra tastes great! </p>
<p><strong>We were almost there. It was time to think about the packaging, which meant finding bottles, caps and most importantly, a designer who understood ELECTRA.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>We were on a roll. But then...something happened that nobody predicted or prepared for: COVID-19. </strong></h2>
<p>It changed everything.  Electra and all operations shut down. Our suppliers were closed. They couldn't get raw materials from their suppliers. It was a hot mess. So, we used the time to deepen our connection with our target audience and develop strategic partnerships. We did more surveys, talked to industry experts, revamped marketing strategy, and made adjustments to the business and launch plans including recruiting potential staff and team members through virtual interviews. Oh, and we created some dope tshirts too!</p>

<p>✅   <strong>A former Dallas NBC news anchor </strong>and activist who, along with her husband, are raising triplet teenage girls plus, a son who champions diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>
<p>✅   <strong>A dynamic couple from my hometown</strong> of Dallas, Texas, he's a retired fireman, she's a pharma sales dynamo - together they stepped up with great enthusiasm and faith in what we're building with Electra.</p>
<p>✅   <strong>Another enthusiastic couple from my hometown</strong> of Dallas, Texas, who have a passion for health &amp; wellness. She's a retired educator &amp; psychology professor and yes, he's a retired firefighter. Apparently, we love firefighters at Electra. </p>

There's a new sports drink in town...and she's got game.
How many hydration and sports drinks have YOU consumed in your lifetime?  I recently had to ask myself the same thing.
Well, between my NCAA Championship college basketball career at The University of Texas to my professional career with the WNBA Champion Houston Comets & Utah Starzz, to my USA National and Olympic team experiences, to my international professional careers in Italy and Switzerland -- I'm guessing I've consumed at least 25,000 gallons of sports drinks and hydration beverages.  I stopped counting a long time ago.
My name's Fran Harris (purple/pink blouse in the photo below) and given my extensive sports background, you might think that the idea for Electra hydration & sports drinks was born 10 or more years ago...but it wasn't.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>We are Felipe and Marcela from Simon's Hot Dogs in Scottsdale. We want to bring Colombian Hot Dogs to as many people as possible, and the best way to do that is by adding a food truck to the streets of Phoenix Metropolitan Area that serves Beef, Pork and Vegan hot dogs, crispy fries load with toppings and some delicious Colombian appetizers.</p>
<p>In Colombia, we take our hot dogs very seriously. All throughout our childhood, we looked forward to the meals where we could enjoy a good hot dog, and when we moved to the United States we learned more about the food culture outside our country,  we realized that the gourmet hot dog was something unique to where we lived. Colombian-style hot dogs are a delicacy that most people have never experienced, but to those of us fortunate enough to have enjoyed them, they are worth turning to again and again, the taste unlike anything else – at once sweet, savory, and delicious.</p>

<h3>Our Background</h3>
<p>Three years ago, we moved from a small closet-sized kitchen in Sedona to Scottsdale Arizona to follow a dream of opening our own full size restaurant. Although the relocation was painful and expensive, our journey have been amazing. People have been asking us to open other locations in different parts of the metro area, but we were not ready for the next step. Recently we were presented with the opportunity to buy an old U-Haul that we are transforming into a food truck, but we need your help to raise money to get the food truck running and bring some delicious Colombian Hot Dogs to the streets. </p>
<p>The way we see it, food should always be an experience. After ten years in business, we know how to offer our customers experiences that are unique and unforgettable, and we can't wait to do that for an even larger audience through our hot dog food truck.</p>

<h3>Where We are Currently</h3>
<p>Having purchased an old U-Haul truck, we have already taken the first big step toward building Simon's Hot Dogs Food Truck into a winning brand. There is still much more work to go, though. This is only the beginning of our story, and to see it through to the end, we are turning to you for some additional support.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our goal through this campaign is to raise $25,000. $20,000 of those funds will cover the costs of  outfitting the food truck – paying for equipment and materials – while the other $5,000 will pay for the wrap and advertising.</p>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>To raise the money for this project we have put together different catering packages you also will have the opportunity to get some awesome deals on discounted gift cards. We appreciate all of your support and in addition to our eternal love and gratitude for your generosity. We hope you take advantage of the savings and some of the once in a lifetime experiences we put together specially for you. (Check the list of perks on the right-side of the campaign page).</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is minimum of risk to what we have planned because of the extensive experience and knowledge that we have amassed throughout our career in the food industry. Aside from the truck itself, none of this is new to us. We have been selling hot dogs for a decade, and whatever logistical challenges arise as we make our operation mobile, we will overcome them. We also promise to keep all my contributors updated regarding all the progress that we make, remaining transparent throughout this expansion.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In addition to making a monetary contribution to this campaign, you can show your support for Simon's Hot Dogs Food Truck by sharing a link to the campaign on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use. Go ahead and let all your friends and family know that we are taking our hot dogs to the streets, and keep an eye out for the map and schedule that we release.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Ben Midulla, Founder and visionary entrepreneur, skilled at catching a trend and acting upon it before others, had an idea to create a company dedicated to producing a top quality, healthy, real energy-related drink for all. Based upon his values of innovation, excellence, boldness, long-term entrepreneurship, persistence, and as a steadfast supporter of the body's mitochondrial enhancement process, <strong>MITO-CHON 250mL</strong> <strong>The Energy Within</strong>, was created.</p>

Mito-Chon delivers flavor and function with beneficial synergistic ingredients. Mito-Chon <strong><i>I</i><i>S </i></strong>a life-force because the human body contains the source of energy creation in the mitochondria.  Once Mito-Chon accesses the 1000s of millions of mitochondria below the cells, their minuscule proton pumps start to produce <strong>ATP (adenosine triphosphate) </strong>the energy needed to exist.  Mito-Chon is the conduit to harness the energy with a cumulative effect to be drawn upon throughout the day when necessary.  <strong>What happens inside the body with Mito-Chon is not magic but scientific fact. </strong>When your mitochondria are running at 100%, energy will be produced to build up a reserve to be tapped into when necessary.  <strong>Increasing Your Mitochondria:</strong> Evidence shows that consistent exercise has a large impact on improving the health and quantity of cellular mitochondria.

<p>The <strong>mitochondria </strong>is central to research into human prehistory, genetic diseases, cell suicide, fertility, aging, bioenergetics, sex, and the eukaryotic cell. To understand how energy is created see this interesting 4 minute animated video below, <strong><i>The Way Energy is Made</i></strong><i><strong>--Mighty Mitochondria A</strong><strong>ction!</strong></i></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/6_2oN1oTK-g?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p><strong>Most of us take our mitochondria for granted.  Only the mitochondria is </strong><strong>where real energy is produced.</strong> But what if you did not have enough mitochondria to live a normal life (take the recent media coverage of Charlie Gard)? MitoAction.org is a non-profit working on cures for <strong>Mito</strong> the disease caused by a deficiency of mitochondria, needed to live a normal life. The video above was made on their behalf. Mito-Chon USA Corp. Ben Midulla has participated in webinars put on by the founder of MitoAction RN Christy Barcal where people that have family or friends with Mito participated.  Listening to them talk about getting through the day because of their lack of natural energy creation really touched Mr. Midulla.    </p>
<p>Our task is to continually educate people about real energy production within the human body and about how with real energy comes real strength, real endurance, real performance, real recovery and real focus. It is about one product, like a heat seeking missile targeting every part of your body below the cellular level, where your mitochondria miniscule proton pumps create ATP (adenosine triphosphate) energy from the good foods you eat and Mito-Chon the energies needed to live. Accomplishing this broader task is the core of our long-term success.</p>
<p><strong>GIVING BACK:</strong> While Mito-Chon cannot create more mitochondria, we believe Mito-Chon can however, provide more energy to the mitochondria that exists in those who have Mito.  I made a pledge to help: Mito-Chon USA Corp will donate Mito-Chon to anyone who has Mito and give a portion of our profits to MitoAction.org for ongoing research.  </p>
<h3><strong>IMPACT of Mito-Chon® 250mL</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What are the standards of Mito-Chon, and is Mito-Chon unique in the market? </strong>Mito-Chon® is part of a gigantic market that generates tens of billions of dollars in revenue, which means there is a huge potential for financial gain.  Companies are making fortunes bottling vitamin water and selling overpriced coffee, while relentlessly exploiting social media for the purpose of convincing future customers into buying their products.  There are more natural and healthy products making it to the market as consumers are changing their buying habits to buy ""clean and natural"" and that is a good trend. The soft drink industry is slowly spiraling down losing billions a year and there is nothing on their horizon to stop the hemorrhaging.  Bai is the closest alternative and is a good choice for what it does and is a better and natural alternative to soft drinks.  With Mito-Chon 250mL we have a  drink that makes a positive unprecedented impact on all our lives and wellbeing in a dramatic positive way in an era where the nation's health is in freefall having taken a turn for the worse. This is our opportunity with <strong>You</strong> to correct a business that in some parts is deeply flawed, so we went after it and got it right with grit, perseverance, and patience. </p>

<p><strong>Mito-Chon </strong>is not easy to duplicate: each process of integrating and formulating the ingredients in and of itself is not obvious. We set the highest of standards to design, develop, and produce a superior product, not another one with a lot of promises and no delivery. In fact, we define a new <strong>“<a href=""http://www.phadvocates.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Health-Halo-Policy-Brief.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Health and Energy Drink M</a><a href=""http://www.phadvocates.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Health-Halo-Policy-Brief.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">arket</a>"" </strong>and provide the education along with it so everyone can be informed as to where energy really comes from and the true meaning of <strong>The ENERGY WITHIN</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>The truth about Mito-Chon® lies in the results:</strong> keeping the body’s engines running at maximum capacity. Mito-Chon® is the <strong>ONLY</strong> product needed, a quality alternative which can eliminate a lot of costly supplements, especially those some feel they need for daily activities, or workouts. There are too many “energy"" drinks, pills, powders, all tagged as different, but virtually the same.  Fillers with too many choices, look-a-likes, coming and going, getting nowhere going in circles like a merry-go-round—another product to get you pumped up with stimulants.<strong> Mito-Chon® is a straight path to a healthy natural energy solution and notably ""feel good"" sensory effect for anyone young and old, so ""Come and Take Us"" and feel and see the difference. And remember, life doesn’t come with directions. One bottle can be taken daily or two if you like. It’s all GOOD. End of story!</strong><br/><br/><strong>Your GOOD body will tell you: we are everything we say on our label and more. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Entrepreneurial Qualifications of the Founder.</strong> In the 80s and 90s, Ben Midulla founded two companies and raised alone in excess of $3 million from private investors that pioneered the development of then leading-edge technologies in the communications industry when the Internet was not a commercial reality, nor were there many satellites. The challenges were overwhelming because we were creating part of the requirements for modern-day communications. These technologies helped launch our communications as we know them today. The first was a proprietary forward error correcting coding (FEC) technology to correct errors in digital data transmissions which led to a Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) chip designed for both commercial, industrial and U.S. military applications. Without FEC, digital data could not be sent from one transmission point to another without errors.  We would never have been able to send a man to the moon without mapping using digital data.  Based upon our FEC technology we were to secure an SBIR Phase I $49,368 and Phase II $500,000 DoD Contracts.  We were only one of three SBIR Phase II awards in the state of Texas that year.  Working with Dr. Wm. W. Wu, former Chief of the Executive Organ at Intelsat in Washington, D.C., leading to the development of ATM FEC technology which provided immediate value-added operating performance in personal, industrial and military computers while being fully compatible with the operating requirements of computer networking ATM technology.  AT&amp;T paid $1 billion dollars for an ATM development company in Bethesda, MD. Our ATM FEC technology was valued at 10% of what that company received from AT&amp;T.</p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges </strong>are to be expected and part of the entrepreneurial life when anyone is developing leading-edge technologies. But the challenge of Mito-Chon®, designed to create the first and best real mitochondrial enhancement drink, presented quite a few unusual circumstances. It all began in 2012, when I was told about a 25mL drink with 8 ingredients developed in Davos, Switzerland, by a pharmacist with a bio-chemical degree, originally intended for his daughter studying for her doctorate and tired all the time.   </p>
<p>The gentleman who told me about this product was involved with me in an unrelated business but he passed along some test results that sounded interesting, and I agreed to try some, so when I met with him in Vienna, Austria he gave me 200 25mL sample shots.  I took 2 in Vienna, one before working out in a gym named McFit and another the next morning before a long return flight to Houston.  I loved the results and knew I wanted to market this product in the USA but first wanted my friends in Houston to try it. They all liked it a lot and by December 2012 we were all convinced this could be a great product that we could build a game-changing company around to challenge the so-called energy and sport drinks industry.   <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> 25mL shot (Dec. 2012)  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501283309/tw5wkbwvrlntopxhczsj.png"" src=""""/> </strong></p>
<p>Due to other unrelated business commitments, I wasn’t ready to move on developing this 25mL shot until Oct. 2013. I then went to Davos, Switzerland to present my offer to bring the product into the USA under my terms. The pharmacist and I could not come to an agreement because he wanted me to pay a retail price of $4.50/bottle for 10,000 25ml bottles. No way would I agree to those terms.  I was willing to cover all manufacturing costs up front and split the profits 50/50 after all expenses, but he did not want that. Some months later after further failed negotiations, I decided with two colleagues to create a formula of our own using the same critical ingredients as a base with 8 more ingredients that would increase the body's mitochondrial cellular activity. Having read several papers by Sepp Porta PhD. on the qualities of magnesium and elderberry, we were close to making the final ingredient selection. We wanted a taste that no one would ever forget, smooth and clean. It came from the elderberry flower, which also is where the <strong>good-for-you </strong><strong>natural sugar</strong> comes from.  Elderberry has the added benefit of converting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to ADP faster, a real plus to creating mitochondrial liberation of real energy. The end result is a super-great selection of ingredients for our new <strong>250mL drink, I named and trademarked, Mito-Chon®</strong>,   See our Ingredients section on our website <a href=""http://www.mito-chonusa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.mito-chonusa.com</a> and read why the <strong>only sugar</strong> in Mito-Chon is natural and comes from the elderberry.</p>

<p>We had to locate all the high-quality ingredients from reputable companies in the USA, Germany and Austria along with Certificates of Analysis, use a formulator in  Vienna, Austria, secure 250mL bottles and bottler and create and print labels for our pre-production run and turn it all over to our co-packer APO Fruchtsafte GmbH in Millstatt See, Austria.  All U.S. Customs details were arranged for the <strong>1st shipment Jul. 2015</strong> (238 cases, 24 bottles/case; 1,488 bottles) air shipped to Houston for initial test market sampling, and then a <strong>2nd shipment Jan 2016</strong> (4,224 bottles). Results were super positive, even though the 1st shipment July 2015 was detained by the FDA so we could comply with their minor label changes, which took us only a matter of days to correct but 4 months for their approval. We can now say that our label was finally <i>approved</i>  in writing by the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Nutrition.  </p>

<p>Kroger is the first grocery store chain ever to sell Mito-Chon in the USA at a promotional price of $3.00 per bottle, or $3.99 without a Kroger Card.  It was a very successful weekend test sampling/selling event as 33 cases were sold in one month with no advertising. Before we can sell on a regional or national basis to Kroger, we must purchase product liability insurance ($35k/yr). We know our final costs to produce Mito-Chon in Austria plus all steps leading to production and shipping. We have dealt with stabilizing our ingredients, correcting our label, triple checking that our shipments would not be mishandled, and dealing with U.S. Customs and Brokers. I could not have done it without drinking Mito-Chon every day and surrounding myself with a committed team. </p>
<p><strong>1st Mito-Chon Group Marketing Meeting 2-27-16</strong>                                   <strong> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501183381/of96ialuncunnlrzyra6.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Members:  </strong>(L\R)<strong> </strong>Ron Moore, DHS; Coleman Tucker, Corp. Atty/Cycling; Dick Meador, Andrew George, PRC VP; Ben Midulla, CEO; Jamie Zarate, Marketing; Trent Vann, Houston Fire Dept; and Mike Cass, Houston Police Dept., Homicide.</p>
<p><strong>Mito-Chon’s Plan for solving manufacturing challenges: </strong>Based upon our first production experience in Austria with APO GmbH in Millsatt See, Austria the co-packer and a local Austrian formulator, we anticipate no issues with our next production run.  However, the building of a major brand requires a co-packer with International connections and very high volume capacity already on their locations.  Working through the Austrian Trade Commission  Starzinger was recommended to Mito-Chon.  This led to a series of conversations after confidentially agreements with Starzinger's head of production.  Starzinger has the bottling equipment for maxi pull top bottles and have worked together before with Ardagh Group in France our bottle manufacturer.  Starzinger has international know-how and years of co-packing experience enabling the company to be the ideal co-packer for Mito-Chon. State-of-the-art filling technology and the expert knowledge in all areas such as material, packaging or transport are what makes Starzinger one of the most competent and successful bottlers in the industry. Total reliability, an excellent price/performance ratio and maximum flexibility ensure individual attention to customers’ requirements. Customer support comes directly from the upper management level.     </p>
<p>In the future, depending upon our sales volumes we will give consideration to bottling in the USA with a co-packer to be determined.  Under this scenario and based upon high bottling purchasing volumes, Ardagh has a bottling manufacturing facility in Montreal but do not currently run our designed bottles at that location; however their managing director in France assured us that once we reach 1 M bottles per week, they will install a dedicated line for our bottles in Montreal thus saving overseas shipping freight costs. </p>
<p><strong>Mito-Chon’s Plan for solving distribution challenges:  </strong>Kroger has their own distribution centers as do all other big box grocery chains, but we have to first get Mito-Chon there. The same goes for Europa Nutrition with seven distribution centers, as does Bodybuilding.com Vitamin Shop, GNC.  We use Priority Worldwide Services (PWS) for international shipping, US Customs clearing and disbursement. PWS is a full service logistics provider operating around the globe. PWS operates strategically placed distribution facilities, 24/7, throughout the US and in key markets worldwide. PWS' US facilities are fully Customs Bonded and allow data to be linked between all offices, available for customers, obtainable directly from their website. PWS' facilities in the Port of Baltimore, MD. house the appropriate equipment and staff to handle major distributions/product roll-outs. PWS’ Warehousing Solutions attest to their flexibility and responsiveness to any situation.  PWS can break down full containers and ship them down to one case if need be to our buyers'  distribution or retail locations.   Mito-Chon wants to concentrate on our core business and need a reliable business partner to handle our distribution details. PWS is our solution.</p>
<p><strong>Mito-Chon’s Plan for solving marketing challenges: </strong>It is the intent of the founder to build Mito-Chon 250mL into a billion-dollar brand within four years.  To make this happen the founder will invite a food and beverage investment partner with direct experience selling in the food and beverage industry, a partner preferably who sees billions of dollars of products that aren’t all that healthy for consumers and has been on mission to challenge what’s sold on those store shelves and has been successful in the food and beverage market. </p>
<p>We know the challenges we face to alter, then change people’s perception of how energy is created and we have just that product in Mito-Chon 250mL and have been successful on a limited basis one-to-one, but we need to take that message nationwide, indeed worldwide.  It could be a sports celebrity who brings that message and/or an up and coming competitor in his sport.</p>
<p>We need a partner who shares our vision for bringing a disruptive product to these markets. We have the great product, great packaging,  great image and our passion runs deep. </p>
<p><b>Mito-Chon’s Plan for individual markets; sports, trucking, and high stress professions: Examples. </b>We have had successful samplings with long haul truckers, the backbone of our distribution network worldwide. Truckers take energy drinks like water, but the majority want something better because they know there will be a crash and burn. We currently have some truckers using Mito-Chon,  Recently we have sampled Mito-Chon with nurses and floor personnel in St. Luke's Hospital in the Houston Medical Center on two floors. For a long day or night working under stress there is nothing better than Mito-Chon.  A few ER doctors are taking Mito-Chon and love it. In October 2-17 the Company co-sponsored a Half-Marathon team of 8 runners in the Houston Half Marathon and 5K run.  All their times were lowered. </p>
<p>Cycling as in Tour de France and Ride Across America, running in marathons and ultra-marathons, Ironman and competitive CrossFit are brutal on the competitors. Each sport or profession benefits from using Mito-Chon, the key is how we reach reach out to these markets. We believe each market is unique and we have <i>that</i> plan to reach each market without just throwing money at advertising and hope it sticks.</p>
<p>The burn rate in beverages is high so under capitalization is not acceptable. We need to prove ourselves regionally before nationally, so any marketing errors can be corrected. LA and Houston are ideal cities, Houston because of it's diversity, which is detailed in our Why Houston, Why Us, Why Now presentation available upon request.   </p>
<p>What makes Mito-Chon stand out against all other energy drinks and sports drinks that gives us the ammunition to challenge those markets?  Here are some good reasons Mito-Chon is in a class of its own when it comes to a stimulating healthy beverage.</p>
<ul>
<li>It energizes you without mega doses of caffeine (20mg in Mito-Chon).</li>
<li>It has an unmatched flavor that will win you over from the first sip. It's lightly carbonated and very refreshing. No stomach discomfort or acidity issues have been recorded to date.</li>
<li>It’s good quality clean burning fuel (bio-energy), not to mention it spreads awareness and education to those that have been misguided by popular energy drink marketing scams.</li>
<li>Its ability to help with overall mood and dial in the all-important mind-muscle connection during exercise. </li>
<li>Its recovery properties are unlike any other beverage in its class as well as added immune support.</li>
<li>It has beneficial anti-aging properties that are not found in other products. Mito-Chon has been mistaken for the ""fountain of youth"" or ""liquid gold"" more than once.  Just look at those who take it.</li>
<li>It's safe for all ages. Mito-Chon is safe for those who suffer from various conditions such as hypertension, heart disease, and cardiac dysrhythmia. There's no surge in respirations, heart rate, blood pressure, or blood glucose (25g carbs in Mito-Chon)</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, when considering the price per serving just imagine a trip to Whole Foods to pick up the Mito-Chon ingredient list. You'd walk away with a hole in your pocket and the absorption of the supplements would be minimal. Our advanced stabilization formalization process delivers micronized nutrients direct to you without waste. You can take all the supplements you want, but if you aren't absorbing them properly you're wasting your money.</p>
<p>Once funded and with Mito-Chon 250mLproduction run in hand  we will will make formal presentations to Kroger Co. and 24 Hour Fitness, both at their corp. headquarters. Both presentations are in Power Point and available upon request to qualified Parties.  With Kroger, it will be their Natural Foods Division.  We have a direct connection with the Head Nutritionist for Kroger in the Houston market, Braulio Garcia, who also co-manages one of Kroger’s over $1 M per week stores in Houston which by coincidence is the Kroger where the founder shops. Braulio was the first to introduce Kroger’s Natural Food department to the Houston market. Braulio has been taking Mito-Chon since July 2015 and is a diabetic.  His Testimony at <a href=""http://www.mito-chonusa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.mito-chonusa.com</a> is a must read, especially if you are a diabetic. Braulio will also consult with Mito-Chon USA Corp. as a nutritionist, and will make, along with the founder the formal introduction of Mito-Chon to Kroger Natrual Foods Division and to athletic programs at universities in Texas by introducing Mito-Chon directly to their nutritionists (the key to gaining acceptance for any product used by athletes in any NCAA sports). There were discussions in April 2016 on about putting Mito-Chon into certain Kroger locations in Houston , Texas  and vicinity Kroger stores as a start. Once sales accelerate Mito-Chon could be in all of Region 2 of Kroger's 12 regions nationally; Kroger could expand Mito-Chon into other Divisions as they deem warranted based upon sales and Mito-Chon USA Corp. meeting all their requirements.  Mito-Chon’s goal with Kroger is to go nationwide and for our red bottle to be featured on the cover of their bi-monthly nutrition magazine (<i>Live Naturally</i>) with a feature story inside.  To ensure product visibility, free-standing portable coolers manufactured in Austin, TX will be supplied to feature/display Mito-Chon.  Similar free-standing portable coolers will be used in 24 Hour Fitness and other gyms whose contracts with other vendors control what goes into their coolers.</p>

<p>Regarding other gym chains and CrossFit, we will introduce Mito-Chon at their National Headquarters, while immediately concentrating on boutique operations.  There are over 600 locations nationwide of these combined facilities charging an average of $35/hr. Equinox with 94 gyms nationwide, is 1 part of 6 high dollar gym chains. Equinox charges over $250/mo. in Houston. We have an immediate large market base regionally in Houston because many of these boutique operations and Equinox have facilities in Houston. CrossFit has 21 Houston area boxes.  Any other big box distribution centers, including Amazon, GNC, The Vitamin Shoppe, Europa Nutrition, bodybuilding.com, we will reach out to them through the already established relationships our partner to-be may have or on our own,       </p>
<p>We have the only mitochondrial enhancement drink with a proprietary technology which is literally impossible to duplicate.  It’s not just our ingredients, it’s the way they are stabilized, making Mito-Chon 250mL the very best synergistic healthy drink like no other.</p>

<tr>
<td style=""width:161px;""><p><strong>Is Mito-Chon a pre-workout?</strong></p></td>
<td style=""width:557px;""><p>No, it is not. Pre-workouts jack you up and then bring you down. Mito-Chon is more than that, it can be taken before, during or after. It is truly a game changer, in a class by itself, a complete all-in-one package that uniquely and naturally liberates the true energy within our bodies create through cell regeneration and the stimulation of ATP production.</p></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style=""width:161px;""><p><strong>Is Mito-Chon just for athletes?</strong></p></td>
<td style=""width:557px;""><p>NO. Mito-Chon is for any person who works under stress for long hours and needs more real energy which only comes from the good foods we eat and some supplements. If you work long hours knowing you must be focused and have real energy within you to overcome exhaustion, then Mito-Chon is for you. And Rock Stars love Mito-Chon.</p></td>

<tr>
<td style=""width:161px;""><p><strong>Why is there only one product?</strong></p></td>
<td style=""width:557px;""><p>We don’t want to confuse YOU with choices of colors, flavors, etc. We don’t make separate products for pre-during-post-recovery. Just one product, Mito-Chon, one great taste--more than enough and your wallet will thank you. Should we come out with another product it will be built on the underpinning of Mito-Chon 250mL; and might just be a <i>little</i> <i>quicker</i> in getting to the mitochondria; but that’s the next chapter.</p></td>
<td><p> </p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style=""width:161px;""><p><strong>What is the mitochondria?</strong></p></td>
<td style=""width:557px;""><p>The human body is made up of about a hundred trillion cells and every one of those cells need energy to fuel and perform its individual functions from moving to thinking to breathing.  And that energy comes from the mito-chondria, the tiny ""power plants"" or tiny cellular “factories” that turn nutrients (food) into a chemical form of energy known as ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The mitochondria make the ATP from our food by a chemical process similar to the internal combustion in a car engine; instead of using gas and oxygen to release energy, food and oxygen is used (source Nick Lane’s book <i>Oxygen</i>). Muscle tissue is filled with mitochondria, and the more you have, the more energy your body produces; the mitochondria are the only place inside your body that can burn fat; the more muscle you have, the more fat you can burn. This is one of the reasons athletes and active individuals tend to be leaner.</p></td>

<tr>
<td style=""width:161px;""><p><strong>How is Mito-Chon different from some energy/sports drinks?</strong></p></td>
<td style=""width:557px;""><p>What Mito-Chon® 250mL manifests is the evolution of the primitive concept of an ""energy drink"", which offers only a temporary experience, into the concept of a ""life-enhancing formula"", based on a deeper understanding of where real energy comes from<strong>. </strong>Mito-Chon is a clean technology that works with the body to enhance life fundamentally.</p></td>
<td><p> </p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style=""width:161px;""><p><strong>What are the active ingredients in Mito-Chon?</strong></p></td>
<td style=""width:557px;""><p>Only the finest natural ingredients, no synthetics (see list on website). As to <strong>Caffeine</strong>, we added a small amount of natural caffeine from the bean because there is evidence it can help in small amounts in central nervous system activity. It also affects adenosine receptors in the thalamus and enhances the synergistic effects of the other ingredients of Mito-Chon.</p></td>

<td colspan=""2"" style=""width:558px;height:43px;""><p>There is sugar and then there is sugar—sound confusing?  The only sugar in Mito-Chon is the <strong>good natural sugar</strong> from the Elderberry berry and flower —there are no added sugars, synthetics or stevia extract that may cause mild side effects such as nausea or stomach discomfort in some people. Erythritol, a sugar alcohol have a laxative effect, causing bloating, intestinal gas and diarrhea.  <a href=""http://www.mito-chonusa.com/ingredients"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style='background-color: transparent;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>http://www.mito-chonusa.com/ingredients</a></p></td>

Short Summary
Ben Midulla, Founder and visionary entrepreneur, skilled at catching a trend and acting upon it before others, had an idea to create a company dedicated to producing a top quality, healthy, real energy-related drink for all. Based upon his values of innovation, excellence, boldness, long-term entrepreneurship, persistence, and as a steadfast supporter of the body's mitochondrial enhancement process, MITO-CHON 250mL The Energy Within, was created.
                      
THE ENERGY WITHIN itself is best described as a “Lift” followed by “Sustained Energy and Health,” as contrasted with the stimulant-based “energy drinks” providing a “Spike” followed by a “Crash” (so ineffective and a likely health concern).  Mito-Chon® is the only drink formulated to get real natural energy to the mitochondria.   We are striving for a market leadership position in the intense and overcrowded “energy drink” and sports supplement markets, tying our tag line THE ENERGY WITHIN to the mitochondria, the “Energy Engine of the Cell.”  Our goal is to deliver a truly REAL “health and natural energy drink” that is far superior to any other product on the market. How are bodies use Mito-Chon ingredients as compared to energy and sports drinks will allow Mito-Chon to be placed with energy drinks and in the Natural Foods departments of grocery stores. Mito-Chon delivers flavor and function with beneficial synergistic ingredients. Mito-Chon IS a life-force because the human body contains the source of energy creation in the mitochondria.  Once Mito-Chon accesses the 1000s of millions of mitochondria below the cells, their minuscule proton pumps start to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) the energy needed to exist.  Mito-Chon is the conduit to harness the energy with a cumulative effect to be drawn upon throughout the day when necessary.  What happens inside the body with Mito-Chon is not magic but scientific fact. When your mitochondria are running at 100%, energy will be produced to build up a reserve to be tapped into when necessary.  Increasing Your Mitochondria: Evidence shows that consistent exercise has a large impact on improving the health and quantity of cellular mitochondria. There is also mounting evidence that targeted nutrition plays a significant role in protecting these vital powerhouses.Check out these two short unsolicited testimonial videos - click on their names - they are really worth seeing.

WE STAND ALONE.
The mitochondria is central to research into human prehistory, genetic diseases, cell suicide, fertility, aging, bioenergetics, sex, and the eukaryotic cell. To understand how energy is created see this interesting 4 minute animated video below, The Way Energy is Made--Mighty Mitochondria Action!

Most of us take our mitochondria for granted.  Only the mitochondria is where real energy is produced. But what if you did not have enough mitochondria to live a normal life (take the recent media coverage of Charlie Gard)? MitoAction.org is a non-profit working on cures for Mito the disease caused by a deficiency of mitochondria, needed to live a normal life. The video above was made on their behalf. Mito-Chon USA Corp. Ben Midulla has participated in webinars put on by the founder of MitoAction RN Christy Barcal where people that have family or friends with Mito participated.  Listening to them talk about getting through the day because of their lack of natural energy creation really touched Mr. Midulla.    
Our task is to continually educate people about real energy production within the human body and about how with real energy comes real strength, real endurance, real performance, real recovery and real focus. It is about one product, like a heat seeking missile targeting every part of your body below the cellular level, where your mitochondria miniscule proton pumps create ATP (adenosine triphosphate) energy from the good foods you eat and Mito-Chon the energies needed to live. Accomplishing this broader task is the core of our long-term success.
GIVING BACK: While Mito-Chon cannot create more mitochondria, we believe Mito-Chon can however, provide more energy to the mitochondria that exists in those who have Mito.  I made a pledge to help: Mito-Chon USA Corp will donate Mito-Chon to anyone who has Mito and give a portion of our profits to MitoAction.org for ongoing research.  
IMPACT of Mito-Chon® 250mL
What are the standards of Mito-Chon, and is Mito-Chon unique in the market? Mito-Chon® is part of a gigantic market that generates tens of billions of dollars in revenue, which means there is a huge potential for financial gain.  Companies are making fortunes bottling vitamin water and selling overpriced coffee, while relentlessly exploiting social media for the purpose of convincing future customers into buying their products.  There are more natural and healthy products making it to the market as consumers are changing their buying habits to buy ""clean and natural"" and that is a good trend. The soft drink industry is slowly spiraling down losing billions a year and there is nothing on their horizon to stop the hemorrhaging.  Bai is the closest alternative and is a good choice for what it does and is a better and natural alternative to soft drinks.  With Mito-Chon 250mL we have a  drink that makes a positive unprecedented impact on all our lives and wellbeing in a dramatic positive way in an era where the nation's health is in freefall having taken a turn for the worse. This is our opportunity with You to correct a business that in some parts is deeply flawed, so we went after it and got it right with grit, perseverance, and patience. 
             OUR RECENT IMPACT: Houston Half Marathon, 10/29/17, 7am-9am             
 
 
Mito-Chon is not easy to duplicate: each process of integrating and formulating the ingredients in and of itself is not obvious. We set the highest of standards to design, develop, and produce a superior product, not another one with a lot of promises and no delivery. In fact, we define a new “Health and Energy Drink Market"" and provide the education along with it so everyone can be informed as to where energy really comes from and the true meaning of The ENERGY WITHIN. 
 Who wants to live their lives one hour at a time on a highway with no exit, looking for a bull ring with a monster in it trying to be a rock star? 
The truth about Mito-Chon® lies in the results: keeping the body’s engines running at maximum capacity. Mito-Chon® is the ONLY product needed, a quality alternative which can eliminate a lot of costly supplements, especially those some feel they need for daily activities, or workouts. There are too many “energy"" drinks, pills, powders, all tagged as different, but virtually the same.  Fillers with too many choices, look-a-likes, coming and going, getting nowhere going in circles like a merry-go-round—another product to get you pumped up with stimulants. Mito-Chon® is a straight path to a healthy natural energy solution and notably ""feel good"" sensory effect for anyone young and old, so ""Come and Take Us"" and feel and see the difference. And remember, life doesn’t come with directions. One bottle can be taken daily or two if you like. It’s all GOOD. End of story!Your GOOD body will tell you: we are everything we say on our label and more.

What fans like YOU will help us achieve when you contribute:  Our contributors will make it possible for Mito-Chon® 250mL to be launched nationwide, indeed, worldwide, creating an awareness through education as to what real energy is, as we make Mito-Chon® a 21st Century brand and #1 non-stimulant healthy drink. Mito-Chon is a fan-based product, and when YOU join our other fans become the most powerful ad medium. Advocates will proudly represent the company, use Mito-Chon and sway others to do the same, not because of payment, but because they genuinely love Mito-Chon, understand its benefits, incorporate it into their daily activities and want their family and friends to love Mito-Chon as well.
We need contributors who can appreciate what Mito-Chon® brings for them and and how it helps to achieve being the very best, mentally and physically. We never manipulate, mislead or misrepresent what Mito-Chon® can do. We provide more than inspirational slogans or catch phrases; we provide a product that inspires, needing no further content of what it provides because it is clearly printed on our unique bottle and expanded upon on our website: www.mito-chonusa.com,  Read detailed information about every ingredient and some serious unsolicited TESTIMONIES, as well as FAQs we experienced since we first brought this product into America in mid 2016.  
Your contributions as new fans can be a powerful force in enabling us to realize the awesome potential of this technology and together build an even larger fan base, as everyone’s new favorite drink—Mito-Chon® 250mL—grows into a world class product, the purpose of our Indiegogo Crowdfunding Campaign.  We need your curiosity, your backing, your input on Mito-Chon®. We need YOU as fans and with your help, someday soon, you can say, “I was there when it all began and helped make it happen."" Come and Take Us.  Together, we are Mito-Chon®. 
What we Need and What You Get:  We need $150,000 to produce 250,000 Mito-Chon filled 250mL bottles. Our red bottles are unique, eye catching, expensive, aluminum; they identify Mito-Chon's statement of quality.  Anything less than $150,000 would drive the costs of our bottles up. We do not use cheap plastic bottles to reduce the cost of Mito-Chon, plus our recyclable red aluminum bottles are lined inside to protect the ingredients.  
When we reach a weekly production run of 1 million bottles, our bottler in France, Ardagh Group, will install a line for our bottles in their Montreal plant, thus saving overseas shipping costs when we are ready for total production in North America. Price breaks are at 500k and 1M bottles.  Materials: ingredients, bottles (screen printed labels); Formulation, blending, production: bottling, packing, shipping, distribution, product liability insurance. Our Excel Spreadsheet details everything, so we know where the money goes. It is the only way we could have made it this far. We are very hands-on and do not depend upon brokers when it comes to securing pricing for anything.  Mito-Chon® 250mL was a great help on those long days and nights.  Help us reach our production goal and YOU will get 25% off MSRP.
Stretch Goals - more money, better results: Should we exceed funding we have Stretch Goals.  Our 1st Stretch Goal will be another $150,000 which will allow us to produce 500,000 Mito-Chon filled 250mL bottles. If we meet our 1st Stretch goal, our 2nd Stretch Goal is another $150,000 to produce 1,000,000 Mito-Chon filled 250mL bottles. The more bottles we are able to order the greater price reduction we get. Details with all costs, expenses, marketing are all- inclusive for every stage including co-packing.
THE PERK - THE BOTTLE - THE PROMISE - THE SOLUTION - 

   
If we don’t reach Stage I goal we will order a minimum quantity of bottles and ingredients, etc. only for our contributors.    ​

Mito-Chon’s 60-day campaign added incentive: Early fans will receive as many as 6      bonus bottles of Mito-Chon shipped within days of their contribution in addition to the Perks they receive.  All fans making contributions for Perks within the first 30 days will receive additional Perks of his or her choice of apparel IF they recommend Mito-Chon to a friend or family member and that person makes their contribution for Perks before our 60-day campaign ends. 
Each Fan contributing in the first 30 days will receive a Referral ID to give to the parties he or she tells about Mito-Chon’s Indiegogo Campaign.  If that party becomes a fan/contributor within the 60-day campaign period, you will get a reward notice when the campaign ends.  The reward will be more Mito-Chon 250mL or a Mito-Chon Come and Take Us sports shirt in his or her size.
What we accomplish with Mito-Chon fan contributions:  Mito-Chon will begin to redefine the perception of how energy is created in the body, where it comes from and how it gets to the sub-cellular mitochondria, where it is processed into real usable ATP energy without side effects, not stimulants that do not last or could be harmful.
We want YOU to be a part of the process for your own health while sharing the message of our campaign with your friends and family. Our goal is to create an awakening movement and make Mito-Chon mainstream, keeping it there, and changing the conversation among active people and athletes that there IS a better, healthier, great tasting drink that delivers flavor and function to assist all of our bodies in liberating their own energy by feeding the mitochondria with natural healthy ingredients, all found in Mito-Chon 250mL.  And what fan/contributor would not want that?  
Entrepreneurial Qualifications of the Founder. In the 80s and 90s, Ben Midulla founded two companies and raised alone in excess of $3 million from private investors that pioneered the development of then leading-edge technologies in the communications industry when the Internet was not a commercial reality, nor were there many satellites. The challenges were overwhelming because we were creating part of the requirements for modern-day communications. These technologies helped launch our communications as we know them today. The first was a proprietary forward error correcting coding (FEC) technology to correct errors in digital data transmissions which led to a Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) chip designed for both commercial, industrial and U.S. military applications. Without FEC, digital data could not be sent from one transmission point to another without errors.  We would never have been able to send a man to the moon without mapping using digital data.  Based upon our FEC technology we were to secure an SBIR Phase I $49,368 and Phase II $500,000 DoD Contracts.  We were only one of three SBIR Phase II awards in the state of Texas that year.  Working with Dr. Wm. W. Wu, former Chief of the Executive Organ at Intelsat in Washington, D.C., leading to the development of ATM FEC technology which provided immediate value-added operating performance in personal, industrial and military computers while being fully compatible with the operating requirements of computer networking ATM technology.  AT&T paid $1 billion dollars for an ATM development company in Bethesda, MD. Our ATM FEC technology was valued at 10% of what that company received from AT&T.
Building the Mito-Chon brand.  Mito-Chon changes the diametric of the energy and sports drink industry because we are NOT THEM.  It is no surprise that Mito-Chon is a “million dollar idea” that has attracted popular companies with not so popular ethics. Mito-Chon is not a sell-out and has been in the testing and pre-marketing phase for three years to ensure that it is the perfection of a clean supplement. Our fans became fans of Mito-Chon because they like themselves.  
We do not make our product with inferior cheap, unpleasant tasting ingredients, loaded with added sugars, synthetics, dyes, proprietary blends, warning labels and side effects just to become more profitable. Together we will alert the misinformed or uninformed that there is Mito-Chon 250mL, good for anyone, young and old, to help them feel more optimistic, fight panic, depression, and all the spin brought about in part by hype, fast highs/crashes associated with current energy drinks. Mito-Chon zeros in on the truth about what’s good for YOU.  It is our story, not just our product.  Our product is the story,  


Risks and challenges are to be expected and part of the entrepreneurial life when anyone is developing leading-edge technologies. But the challenge of Mito-Chon®, designed to create the first and best real mitochondrial enhancement drink, presented quite a few unusual circumstances. It all began in 2012, when I was told about a 25mL drink with 8 ingredients developed in Davos, Switzerland, by a pharmacist with a bio-chemical degree, originally intended for his daughter studying for her doctorate and tired all the time.   
The gentleman who told me about this product was involved with me in an unrelated business but he passed along some test results that sounded interesting, and I agreed to try some, so when I met with him in Vienna, Austria he gave me 200 25mL sample shots.  I took 2 in Vienna, one before working out in a gym named McFit and another the next morning before a long return flight to Houston.  I loved the results and knew I wanted to market this product in the USA but first wanted my friends in Houston to try it. They all liked it a lot and by December 2012 we were all convinced this could be a great product that we could build a game-changing company around to challenge the so-called energy and sport drinks industry.    
 25mL shot (Dec. 2012)   
Due to other unrelated business commitments, I wasn’t ready to move on developing this 25mL shot until Oct. 2013. I then went to Davos, Switzerland to present my offer to bring the product into the USA under my terms. The pharmacist and I could not come to an agreement because he wanted me to pay a retail price of $4.50/bottle for 10,000 25ml bottles. No way would I agree to those terms.  I was willing to cover all manufacturing costs up front and split the profits 50/50 after all expenses, but he did not want that. Some months later after further failed negotiations, I decided with two colleagues to create a formula of our own using the same critical ingredients as a base with 8 more ingredients that would increase the body's mitochondrial cellular activity. Having read several papers by Sepp Porta PhD. on the qualities of magnesium and elderberry, we were close to making the final ingredient selection. We wanted a taste that no one would ever forget, smooth and clean. It came from the elderberry flower, which also is where the good-for-you natural sugar comes from.  Elderberry has the added benefit of converting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to ADP faster, a real plus to creating mitochondrial liberation of real energy. The end result is a super-great selection of ingredients for our new 250mL drink, I named and trademarked, Mito-Chon®,   See our Ingredients section on our website http://www.mito-chonusa.com and read why the only sugar in Mito-Chon is natural and comes from the elderberry.
  Mito-Chon 250mL (2015)  
We had to locate all the high-quality ingredients from reputable companies in the USA, Germany and Austria along with Certificates of Analysis, use a formulator in  Vienna, Austria, secure 250mL bottles and bottler and create and print labels for our pre-production run and turn it all over to our co-packer APO Fruchtsafte GmbH in Millstatt See, Austria.  All U.S. Customs details were arranged for the 1st shipment Jul. 2015 (238 cases, 24 bottles/case; 1,488 bottles) air shipped to Houston for initial test market sampling, and then a 2nd shipment Jan 2016 (4,224 bottles). Results were super positive, even though the 1st shipment July 2015 was detained by the FDA so we could comply with their minor label changes, which took us only a matter of days to correct but 4 months for their approval. We can now say that our label was finally approved  in writing by the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Nutrition.

The 3rd shipment July 2016 (14,787 bottles, 616 cases) made a total of 20,499 bottles for all three shipments, which led to our successful test sampling and selling in Houston grocery stores (Kroger) and three samplings at a Houston 24 Hour Fitness gym.

Kroger is the first grocery store chain ever to sell Mito-Chon in the USA at a promotional price of $3.00 per bottle, or $3.99 without a Kroger Card.  It was a very successful weekend test sampling/selling event as 33 cases were sold in one month with no advertising. Before we can sell on a regional or national basis to Kroger, we must purchase product liability insurance ($35k/yr). We know our final costs to produce Mito-Chon in Austria plus all steps leading to production and shipping. We have dealt with stabilizing our ingredients, correcting our label, triple checking that our shipments would not be mishandled, and dealing with U.S. Customs and Brokers. I could not have done it without drinking Mito-Chon every day and surrounding myself with a committed team. 
1st Mito-Chon Group Marketing Meeting 2-27-16                                    
Key Members:  (L\R) Ron Moore, DHS; Coleman Tucker, Corp. Atty/Cycling; Dick Meador, Andrew George, PRC VP; Ben Midulla, CEO; Jamie Zarate, Marketing; Trent Vann, Houston Fire Dept; and Mike Cass, Houston Police Dept., Homicide.
Mito-Chon’s Plan for solving manufacturing challenges: Based upon our first production experience in Austria with APO GmbH in Millsatt See, Austria the co-packer and a local Austrian formulator, we anticipate no issues with our next production run.  However, the building of a major brand requires a co-packer with International connections and very high volume capacity already on their locations.  Working through the Austrian Trade Commission  Starzinger was recommended to Mito-Chon.  This led to a series of conversations after confidentially agreements with Starzinger's head of production.  Starzinger has the bottling equipment for maxi pull top bottles and have worked together before with Ardagh Group in France our bottle manufacturer.  Starzinger has international know-how and years of co-packing experience enabling the company to be the ideal co-packer for Mito-Chon. State-of-the-art filling technology and the expert knowledge in all areas such as material, packaging or transport are what makes Starzinger one of the most competent and successful bottlers in the industry. Total reliability, an excellent price/performance ratio and maximum flexibility ensure individual attention to customers’ requirements. Customer support comes directly from the upper management level.     
In the future, depending upon our sales volumes we will give consideration to bottling in the USA with a co-packer to be determined.  Under this scenario and based upon high bottling purchasing volumes, Ardagh has a bottling manufacturing facility in Montreal but do not currently run our designed bottles at that location; however their managing director in France assured us that once we reach 1 M bottles per week, they will install a dedicated line for our bottles in Montreal thus saving overseas shipping freight costs. 
Mito-Chon’s Plan for solving distribution challenges:  Kroger has their own distribution centers as do all other big box grocery chains, but we have to first get Mito-Chon there. The same goes for Europa Nutrition with seven distribution centers, as does Bodybuilding.com Vitamin Shop, GNC.  We use Priority Worldwide Services (PWS) for international shipping, US Customs clearing and disbursement. PWS is a full service logistics provider operating around the globe. PWS operates strategically placed distribution facilities, 24/7, throughout the US and in key markets worldwide. PWS' US facilities are fully Customs Bonded and allow data to be linked between all offices, available for customers, obtainable directly from their website. PWS' facilities in the Port of Baltimore, MD. house the appropriate equipment and staff to handle major distributions/product roll-outs. PWS’ Warehousing Solutions attest to their flexibility and responsiveness to any situation.  PWS can break down full containers and ship them down to one case if need be to our buyers'  distribution or retail locations.   Mito-Chon wants to concentrate on our core business and need a reliable business partner to handle our distribution details. PWS is our solution.
Mito-Chon’s Plan for solving marketing challenges: It is the intent of the founder to build Mito-Chon 250mL into a billion-dollar brand within four years.  To make this happen the founder will invite a food and beverage investment partner with direct experience selling in the food and beverage industry, a partner preferably who sees billions of dollars of products that aren’t all that healthy for consumers and has been on mission to challenge what’s sold on those store shelves and has been successful in the food and beverage market. 
We know the challenges we face to alter, then change people’s perception of how energy is created and we have just that product in Mito-Chon 250mL and have been successful on a limited basis one-to-one, but we need to take that message nationwide, indeed worldwide.  It could be a sports celebrity who brings that message and/or an up and coming competitor in his sport.
We need a partner who shares our vision for bringing a disruptive product to these markets. We have the great product, great packaging,  great image and our passion runs deep. 
Mito-Chon’s Plan for individual markets; sports, trucking, and high stress professions: Examples. We have had successful samplings with long haul truckers, the backbone of our distribution network worldwide. Truckers take energy drinks like water, but the majority want something better because they know there will be a crash and burn. We currently have some truckers using Mito-Chon,  Recently we have sampled Mito-Chon with nurses and floor personnel in St. Luke's Hospital in the Houston Medical Center on two floors. For a long day or night working under stress there is nothing better than Mito-Chon.  A few ER doctors are taking Mito-Chon and love it. In October 2-17 the Company co-sponsored a Half-Marathon team of 8 runners in the Houston Half Marathon and 5K run.  All their times were lowered. 
Cycling as in Tour de France and Ride Across America, running in marathons and ultra-marathons, Ironman and competitive CrossFit are brutal on the competitors. Each sport or profession benefits from using Mito-Chon, the key is how we reach reach out to these markets. We believe each market is unique and we have that plan to reach each market without just throwing money at advertising and hope it sticks.
The burn rate in beverages is high so under capitalization is not acceptable. We need to prove ourselves regionally before nationally, so any marketing errors can be corrected. LA and Houston are ideal cities, Houston because of it's diversity, which is detailed in our Why Houston, Why Us, Why Now presentation available upon request.   
What makes Mito-Chon stand out against all other energy drinks and sports drinks that gives us the ammunition to challenge those markets?  Here are some good reasons Mito-Chon is in a class of its own when it comes to a stimulating healthy beverage.

It energizes you without mega doses of caffeine (20mg in Mito-Chon).
It has an unmatched flavor that will win you over from the first sip. It's lightly carbonated and very refreshing. No stomach discomfort or acidity issues have been recorded to date.
It’s good quality clean burning fuel (bio-energy), not to mention it spreads awareness and education to those that have been misguided by popular energy drink marketing scams.
Its ability to help with overall mood and dial in the all-important mind-muscle connection during exercise. 
Its recovery properties are unlike any other beverage in its class as well as added immune support.
It has beneficial anti-aging properties that are not found in other products. Mito-Chon has been mistaken for the ""fountain of youth"" or ""liquid gold"" more than once.  Just look at those who take it.
It's safe for all ages. Mito-Chon is safe for those who suffer from various conditions such as hypertension, heart disease, and cardiac dysrhythmia. There's no surge in respirations, heart rate, blood pressure, or blood glucose (25g carbs in Mito-Chon)

In summary, when considering the price per serving just imagine a trip to Whole Foods to pick up the Mito-Chon ingredient list. You'd walk away with a hole in your pocket and the absorption of the supplements would be minimal. Our advanced stabilization formalization process delivers micronized nutrients direct to you without waste. You can take all the supplements you want, but if you aren't absorbing them properly you're wasting your money.
Once funded and with Mito-Chon 250mLproduction run in hand  we will will make formal presentations to Kroger Co. and 24 Hour Fitness, both at their corp. headquarters. Both presentations are in Power Point and available upon request to qualified Parties.  With Kroger, it will be their Natural Foods Division.  We have a direct connection with the Head Nutritionist for Kroger in the Houston market, Braulio Garcia, who also co-manages one of Kroger’s over $1 M per week stores in Houston which by coincidence is the Kroger where the founder shops. Braulio was the first to introduce Kroger’s Natural Food department to the Houston market. Braulio has been taking Mito-Chon since July 2015 and is a diabetic.  His Testimony at http://www.mito-chonusa.com is a must read, especially if you are a diabetic. Braulio will also consult with Mito-Chon USA Corp. as a nutritionist, and will make, along with the founder the formal introduction of Mito-Chon to Kroger Natrual Foods Division and to athletic programs at universities in Texas by introducing Mito-Chon directly to their nutritionists (the key to gaining acceptance for any product used by athletes in any NCAA sports). There were discussions in April 2016 on about putting Mito-Chon into certain Kroger locations in Houston , Texas  and vicinity Kroger stores as a start. Once sales accelerate Mito-Chon could be in all of Region 2 of Kroger's 12 regions nationally; Kroger could expand Mito-Chon into other Divisions as they deem warranted based upon sales and Mito-Chon USA Corp. meeting all their requirements.  Mito-Chon’s goal with Kroger is to go nationwide and for our red bottle to be featured on the cover of their bi-monthly nutrition magazine (Live Naturally) with a feature story inside.  To ensure product visibility, free-standing portable coolers manufactured in Austin, TX will be supplied to feature/display Mito-Chon.  Similar free-standing portable coolers will be used in 24 Hour Fitness and other gyms whose contracts with other vendors control what goes into their coolers.
  Braulio Garcia, Nutritionist Consultant
Regarding other gym chains and CrossFit, we will introduce Mito-Chon at their National Headquarters, while immediately concentrating on boutique operations.  There are over 600 locations nationwide of these combined facilities charging an average of $35/hr. Equinox with 94 gyms nationwide, is 1 part of 6 high dollar gym chains. Equinox charges over $250/mo. in Houston. We have an immediate large market base regionally in Houston because many of these boutique operations and Equinox have facilities in Houston. CrossFit has 21 Houston area boxes.  Any other big box distribution centers, including Amazon, GNC, The Vitamin Shoppe, Europa Nutrition, bodybuilding.com, we will reach out to them through the already established relationships our partner to-be may have or on our own,       
We have the only mitochondrial enhancement drink with a proprietary technology which is literally impossible to duplicate.  It’s not just our ingredients, it’s the way they are stabilized, making Mito-Chon 250mL the very best synergistic healthy drink like no other.

MITO-CHON FAQ


What is Mito-Chon?
Mito-Chon is a 250mL drink. It is in a new category unlike anything ever sold before. It does not create energy, it harnesses the essence of energy created within the body by the natural process of the energy engine performance of the mitochondria.
 


Who created it?
Ben Midulla, Dr. Rick Bellamy, Dick Meador, with special acknowledgement to Hans-Peter Strobel (Switzerland) and Dr. Seppe Porta (Austria).
 


Why should we use it?
Mito-Chon is our #1 life-enhancing, great tasting, clean formulation of all-natural beneficial ingredients that liberate the ENERGY WITHIN, your body's KEY to better health/feeling younger/performing better.
 


Is Mito-Chon a pre-workout?
No, it is not. Pre-workouts jack you up and then bring you down. Mito-Chon is more than that, it can be taken before, during or after. It is truly a game changer, in a class by itself, a complete all-in-one package that uniquely and naturally liberates the true energy within our bodies create through cell regeneration and the stimulation of ATP production.
 


Is Mito-Chon just for athletes?
NO. Mito-Chon is for any person who works under stress for long hours and needs more real energy which only comes from the good foods we eat and some supplements. If you work long hours knowing you must be focused and have real energy within you to overcome exhaustion, then Mito-Chon is for you. And Rock Stars love Mito-Chon.
 


Why is there only one product?
We don’t want to confuse YOU with choices of colors, flavors, etc. We don’t make separate products for pre-during-post-recovery. Just one product, Mito-Chon, one great taste--more than enough and your wallet will thank you. Should we come out with another product it will be built on the underpinning of Mito-Chon 250mL; and might just be a little quicker in getting to the mitochondria; but that’s the next chapter.
 


What is the mitochondria?
The human body is made up of about a hundred trillion cells and every one of those cells need energy to fuel and perform its individual functions from moving to thinking to breathing.  And that energy comes from the mito-chondria, the tiny ""power plants"" or tiny cellular “factories” that turn nutrients (food) into a chemical form of energy known as ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The mitochondria make the ATP from our food by a chemical process similar to the internal combustion in a car engine; instead of using gas and oxygen to release energy, food and oxygen is used (source Nick Lane’s book Oxygen). Muscle tissue is filled with mitochondria, and the more you have, the more energy your body produces; the mitochondria are the only place inside your body that can burn fat; the more muscle you have, the more fat you can burn. This is one of the reasons athletes and active individuals tend to be leaner.
 


How is Mito-Chon different from some energy/sports drinks?
What Mito-Chon® 250mL manifests is the evolution of the primitive concept of an ""energy drink"", which offers only a temporary experience, into the concept of a ""life-enhancing formula"", based on a deeper understanding of where real energy comes from. Mito-Chon is a clean technology that works with the body to enhance life fundamentally.
 


What are the active ingredients in Mito-Chon?
Only the finest natural ingredients, no synthetics (see list on website). As to Caffeine, we added a small amount of natural caffeine from the bean because there is evidence it can help in small amounts in central nervous system activity. It also affects adenosine receptors in the thalamus and enhances the synergistic effects of the other ingredients of Mito-Chon.
 


Why is sugar in Mito-Chon?
There is sugar and then there is sugar—sound confusing?  The only sugar in Mito-Chon is the good natural sugar from the Elderberry berry and flower —there are no added sugars, synthetics or stevia extract that may cause mild side effects such as nausea or stomach discomfort in some people. Erythritol, a sugar alcohol have a laxative effect, causing bloating, intestinal gas and diarrhea.  http://www.mito-chonusa.com/ingredients


Will I experience any side-effects?
No side effects, other than feeling good, with improved strength, performance, endurance, recovery, focus, etc.


What are the directions for use and the shelf life of Mito-Chon?

Life doesn't come with directions.  Take one bottle daily or two if you like. It’s all good. End of story.
And 2 years shelf life on production bottles.




 
Who makes Mito-Chon and where is Mito-Chon made?

Our first trail production run was in Austria, bottled by APO Fruchtsäfte GmbH in Millstatt, AM, See, Austria. Depending upon the success of this campaign we will use Starzinger in Austria one of the biggest bottlers in Europe as our co-packer. 



Why are bonus perk bottles being offered?
 
 

We don’t want YOU to wait until late January 2018, and by getting samples now we hope it will encourage you to tell everyone you know how good Mito-Chon tastes and how good it is for YOU. Also, tell everyone YOU know to join you as a new fan/contributor of Mito-Chon. The reason for this immediate shipment of 1 to 6 Mito-Chon 250mL bottles from our 1st trial production run* offered in this Indiegogo Campaign.


Where can we buy it?
Indiegogo campaign and from website: www.mito-chonusa.com.


What do we get when we order?
An immediate shipment of 1 to 6 Mito-Chon 250mL bottles from our 1st trial production run.


 

JUST FOR YOU!
As an added Perk for every one of our contributors that purchases at least one case during this campaign you will receive a code so that you can     purchase up to two cases of Mito-Chon per month at $66 per case for yourself and your direct family for one year.

PRODUCT FEATURES

Three days later we were off to the races, making an offer on the Montana Building. We bought a building on main street (Central) to attract as many people to an area that will benefit the surrounding businesses as well. With an original background in finance, I immediately signed up for brewing classes over the next semester at MSUB, and have made batch upon batch with my co-brewmaster Matthew Speed. Additionally I have since spent most days arranging the financing of the project - Shanda (Galahan) Speed, Patrick Galahan, Tiffany (Galahan) Wietecki, Robert Galahan.  This is a BIG project, with a huge (expensive) renovation, expensive equipment, and uncountable hours to bring it to fruition. So many hours, that it has required me to quit my finance job to work full time on Gally's! It is time to make it happen!We have made significant progress so far, and have the majority of the project funded/budgeted for currently. That said, we are looking to not only make Gally's opening a sure thing, but simultaneously pull the projected opening date forward from our original estimate. We are shooting high, and hoping to raise the last $50,000 to purchase a few of the last pieces of equipment necessary (walk-in cooler, 2x jacketed fermentors, glycol chiller, tables and chairs) to provide a finished product, hopefully soon!Cheers!-Drew",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My Name is Michael. I am a proud graduate of the Culinary Institute of America's Baking and Pastry program. I am looking to bring over 5 years of professional bread baking experience to Mt. Pleasant. I love sharing my passion of fermentation with others, and feel that Mt. Pleasant is missing the greatness of a true artisan bread bakery. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Okay, now time to get down to the nitty gritty: </p>
<p>I am seeking $150,000 in funding. We will be utilizing this money to place a down payment on the building, complete renovations of the building to be ready for food production, purchase equipment, as well as get some ingredients to get started. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, you're probably wondering...""What's in it for me?"" I am offering a wide range of perks for my supporters. For contributions of $5, I'm offering a social media virtual High-Five. $10 contributions will earn yourself 2 free loaves of bread. For those who contribute $50, I'm offering 10 free loaves. $100 will earn you the right to claim 1 free loaf of bread a day for an entire year. If your feeling indulgent, a whopping contribution of $1000 or more will earn you 1 FREE LOAF A DAY FOR LIFE!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So now that you know what we need, and what you get for helping me out let's talk about how Central Michigan Bread Company will affect Mt. Pleasant:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will be Mt. Pleasant's first truly artisan bread bakery.</li>
<li>We have the potential to help grow the local economy through the use of local ingredients, as well as offering our products to local business to use themselves. </li>
<li>We look to help improve the health of our community through offering fully fermented bread products. Increasing research shows that fermented wheat products can be tolerated by those with gluten sensitivities. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Well let's face it, starting a business has it's challenges. Especially if that business is in the business of making and selling food. Here are a few challenges we could face:</p>
<ul>
<li>The community doesn't accept an artisan product because they aren't familiar with true bread. We will combat this through advertising, attending events, and offering samples to help educate our community. </li>
<li>The cost of our locally sourced ingredients increases beyond the point where our customers are willing to pay for the breads we will produce. If we face this challenge, we may have to lower our product standards and utlize less expensive national brands in order to keep ingredient costs in check. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help financially, I totally understand. That doesn't mean you can't help. Share our project on all of your available social media accounts so all of your friends, and family can help. If your friends and family don't have access to social media, shout it from the mountain top. The more people that know about our goal, the more likely you will be able to enjoy our amazing bread.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The next stage of the journey</b></p>
<p>Having
developed the concept of ScentedSilicone, we spoke to many great people
involved in silicone, perfume, fragrance and merchandise. Our discussions
across those industries have confirmed our belief that this is a fabulous
concept. To take ScentedSilicone to the next stage of its journey, we have been
searching for a product that will show off the quality and potential of what we
have created, and at the same time have a positive effect in our communities –
and we’ve found it! </p>
<p>We became
aware of some research carried out at St George's Hospital, London, which
indicates that the fragrance of vanilla can reduce the craving for chocolate by
up to 50%. This sparked our idea to use our technology to produce a wristband to
help support people trying to lose weight. </p>

<p><b>What We
Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>It's the
norm that silicone items like this are made in Asia. We have tried hard to go
against this tide, and bring manufacturing and jobs closer to home. Our
fragrance oil is sourced in the UK, the special bit where we turn the pure
fragrance oil into a powder to be encapsulated into the silicone is carried out in the UK and even the amazing
odourless silicone we have created is made in the UK!!  However, we still
have to send everything over to the Far East to have the final product
manufactured from all the component parts that we create here in the UK. </p>
<p>We want
to bring the manufacturing of our products back to the UK – if possible back to
Wales. We want to be able to buy moulds and machinery and train local people
here, in the UK, to make our great products and then send them out across the
globe.</p>

<p>$10,000 will enable us to purchase a press and a

and help us make our ScentedSilicone products! With all the ideas we have – from
iPhone covers smelling of apples (what else?) to clothing tags fragranced with
the in-store brand perfume – we’re hoping we can employ more than one person
too!</p>
<p>As we
have worked on ScentedSilicone, we have become aware of a huge – almost endless
– number of applications and uses for the product: from merchandising and
marketing to more serious hygiene and medical applications – anti-stress and
anti-anxiety products, and we are even in the early stages of developing a band
to help Alzheimers sufferers. We are looking to raise funds to develop these
avenues </p>

<strong>Ralvin Ciders</strong> is made up of husband and wife duo, Shea and Mark Germany. We have a passion for all things craft beverage and the stories behind them. Cider has become our specialty- here's how:</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""> </div>
</div>
<p>In 2016, Mark left his 16 year retail management career to pursue his and our dream of opening a winery and vineyard. Half way through our Enology and Viticulture training we noticed a hole in the industry. We looked at each other and said, ""Hey! Where's all the cider?"" Thus, our baby Ralvin Ciders was born. We could not believe the lack of cider circulating through Texas and much of the United States and we knew this would be our ""in"". </p>
<p>Since that AH-HA moment we have been tinkering around with several recipes and have made big, bold, and unique hard apple ciders- something we have not found anywhere else. We want to bring this cider to Lil'd-- Denton, Texas. There are no other cideries in Denton and no other people like Dentonites. The fun-loving and genuine people that call Denton home is what has drawn us here to stay. </p>

Cider has become our specialty- here's how:
 

In 2016, Mark left his 16 year retail management career to pursue his and our dream of opening a winery and vineyard. Half way through our Enology and Viticulture training we noticed a hole in the industry. We looked at each other and said, ""Hey! Where's all the cider?"" Thus, our baby Ralvin Ciders was born. We could not believe the lack of cider circulating through Texas and much of the United States and we knew this would be our ""in"". 
Since that AH-HA moment we have been tinkering around with several recipes and have made big, bold, and unique hard apple ciders- something we have not found anywhere else. We want to bring this cider to Lil'd-- Denton, Texas. There are no other cideries in Denton and no other people like Dentonites. The fun-loving and genuine people that call Denton home is what has drawn us here to stay.

<h3>About OddPitch Brewing</h3>
<p>Gabe Stinchfield has been in the craft beer industry for nearly a decade.  Starting in retail, then bartending, then management, as well as sales and marketing for distributorships and breweries.  He also began home-brewing around the same time, which sparked his desire to open a brewery.  Six years ago he began the plans for OddPitch Brewing and has been focused on it ever since.</p>
<p>Including Gabe, OddPitch Brewing consists of an incredibly talented group of people.  Our Queen and General Manager, Kendra Bell, has an extensive background in customer service and management.  She's the reason the place will still be standing at the end of the day, the walls are just for show.  We have a very talented brewer, Jake ""Tranquility Blouse"" Principe, who will be joining the team as we get closer to opening our doors. </p>
<p>This campaign is the last step in making the dream of OddPitch Brewing a reality.  When the campaign concludes we will finalize on a location for the brewery and begin renovating as well as ordering equipment.  It's been a dream for ten years, a hope for six, and finally it's a reality today.</p>

<h3>What's It To You and What Do We Get?</h3>
<p>For this campaign we are looking to reach a goal of $20,000.  In addition to the money currently raised through investments from friends and family, this funding will allow us to finalize our loan process.  Once finalized, we will use the money we raise here to purchase fermentation vessels and oak barrels.  Anything left over will go directly in to creating a comfortable, welcoming and seriously awesome tap room.</p>
<p>As far as what you get:  the goods.  The treasures!  We are offering a tasty list of perks as our way of saying ""Thank you for being so insanely, incredibly, fantastically amazing to us!""  There are several perks that need some explanation and this is where those details are found.  <i>(Please keep in mind that merchandise is subject to slight changes from the pictures.  However, we have every intention of providing quality, comfortable merchandise.  Because, well, it's merch with our logo and we want you to love it as much as we do!</i><i>)</i></p>

We both have a history in food service and creative arts and feel it's time to branch out on our own. We're two quirky, caring women who have a love for daring flavor combinations and a heart for serving others.</p><p>Our goal is to create a warm and welcoming place for a sweet date night, to kick back with friends, or that familiar place open late that lets you unwind after work. We want to impact our community one happy tummy at a time. Our town is lacking a hang out spot where people can walk right in and feel like one of the family. We plan on filling that need. We're a social bunch with the culinary and customer service skills to drive success and embellish our downtown fairway.</p><p>We have the recipes, ingenuity, drive and determination. We'll feature many classic pies, several new creations and even pot and shepherds pies. We also will have sweet breads and cupcakes. (a little something for everyone) What YOU our contributors would do for us is bring this from a dream into a reality. We have a plan without enough capital and a vision without enough resources. We don't need much, and the amount may seem very little to many but it's just barely out of reach for us. It truly would be the beginning of so much more than just one storefront, it would be the first step for we business women with dreams of owning an even larger business in the future. Here's to great beginnings. </p><p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p><p>We are seeking to raise at least $2,000. This is a low, make-it-work, bare bones figure, our real hope is more towards $10,000. The $2,000 would cover the permits, licensing, legal fees, and other potential unknowns. We already have a commercial ice maker and espresso machine, part of our need is to have a commercial contractor move a water line, other than that the space is move-in ready. We don't have huge needs as we have been collecting items for the shop over time, but a bit more money to take care of legal fees, licensing, and permits is our really big need. And to ensure the longevity of our business in our town, any funds raised beyond our base $2,000 will be saved and used wisely as the need arises.</p><p>Incentives and Perks</p><p>Let's talk incentives! As if it isn't reward enough just knowing you've helped bring to life something wonderful, we're happy to offer an incentive for you. Contributions in any amount would be very welcome of course. When you donate you have the option of redeeming your perk, so please indicate.</p><p>Even if we don't reach our full campaign goal, we will STILL use every bit of your contributions to make this dream a reality. We REALLY want to make our goal since the % we'll receive when we do is significantly greater. But if we don't... Plans may need to be shifted, dates altered, long hours will be put in, but we are determined. There will be pie!</p><p>The Impact</p><p>In our previous campaign we shared videos and interviews, where folks here in town talk about not having any place to go and hang out, we know we will be the remedy for this.</p><p>We as a family are social people with a heart for hospitality. As servers, we have dealt with the public, building friendships with the many people we come in contact with. We look forward to doing this in an even greater way in our own place, in our own town.</p><p>Imagine a quaint, charming, converted home with a cobblestone back patio twinkle-lit for summer evenings filled with the warm comforting aroma of freshly baked pie and the rich aroma of gourmet coffee. This is the dream that you can help breathe life into. </p><p>Other Ways You Can Help</p><p>We know that not everyone has the means to contribute financially, but we all know that any good business (or campaign) sees greater success when we use word of mouth. If you believe in this campaign we would love for you to show us around, talk us up, help us reach (and even exceed) our target goal.</p><p>Please remember you can use the Indiegogo share tools! Facebook, twitter, or post it to all your contacts in your email address book. (wishful thinking on our part, we know. But it never hurts to ask.)</p><p>Thanks for checking us out, stay sweet!<br/>Shannon and Lia</p></div>","Who we are & what we're aboutHi we are Shannon/mom/mums and Lia/daughter/dots We are a mother-daughter baking duo with a vision to bring an upscale yet cozy atmosphere to the downtown district of our charming hometown with pies and goodies like grandma used to make, with a twist; with a modern yet eclectic feel.

We're two quirky, caring women who have a love for daring flavor combinations and a heart for serving others.Our goal is to create a warm and welcoming place for a sweet date night, to kick back with friends, or that familiar place open late that lets you unwind after work. We want to impact our community one happy tummy at a time. Our town is lacking a hang out spot where people can walk right in and feel like one of the family. We plan on filling that need. We're a social bunch with the culinary and customer service skills to drive success and embellish our downtown fairway.We have the recipes, ingenuity, drive and determination. We'll feature many classic pies, several new creations and even pot and shepherds pies. We also will have sweet breads and cupcakes. (a little something for everyone) What YOU our contributors would do for us is bring this from a dream into a reality. We have a plan without enough capital and a vision without enough resources. We don't need much, and the amount may seem very little to many but it's just barely out of reach for us. It truly would be the beginning of so much more than just one storefront, it would be the first step for we business women with dreams of owning an even larger business in the future. Here's to great beginnings. What We Need & What You GetWe are seeking to raise at least $2,000. This is a low, make-it-work, bare bones figure, our real hope is more towards $10,000. The $2,000 would cover the permits, licensing, legal fees, and other potential unknowns. We already have a commercial ice maker and espresso machine, part of our need is to have a commercial contractor move a water line, other than that the space is move-in ready. We don't have huge needs as we have been collecting items for the shop over time, but a bit more money to take care of legal fees, licensing, and permits is our really big need. And to ensure the longevity of our business in our town, any funds raised beyond our base $2,000 will be saved and used wisely as the need arises.Incentives and PerksLet's talk incentives! As if it isn't reward enough just knowing you've helped bring to life something wonderful, we're happy to offer an incentive for you. Contributions in any amount would be very welcome of course. When you donate you have the option of redeeming your perk, so please indicate.Even if we don't reach our full campaign goal, we will STILL use every bit of your contributions to make this dream a reality. We REALLY want to make our goal since the % we'll receive when we do is significantly greater. But if we don't... Plans may need to be shifted, dates altered, long hours will be put in, but we are determined. There will be pie!The ImpactIn our previous campaign we shared videos and interviews, where folks here in town talk about not having any place to go and hang out, we know we will be the remedy for this.We as a family are social people with a heart for hospitality. As servers, we have dealt with the public, building friendships with the many people we come in contact with. We look forward to doing this in an even greater way in our own place, in our own town.Imagine a quaint, charming, converted home with a cobblestone back patio twinkle-lit for summer evenings filled with the warm comforting aroma of freshly baked pie and the rich aroma of gourmet coffee. This is the dream that you can help breathe life into. Other Ways You Can HelpWe know that not everyone has the means to contribute financially, but we all know that any good business (or campaign) sees greater success when we use word of mouth. If you believe in this campaign we would love for you to show us around, talk us up, help us reach (and even exceed) our target goal.Please remember you can use the Indiegogo share tools! Facebook, twitter, or post it to all your contacts in your email address book. (wishful thinking on our part, we know. But it never hurts to ask.)Thanks for checking us out, stay sweet!Shannon and Lia",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Can you help Imad's Syrian Kitchen create a permanent home in London?</h3>
<p>Since Imad fled Syria in 2015, he has cooked for refugees on the streets of Calais and provided free falafel for anyone who can't afford it at his pop-ups in London. He’s also raised almost £200k for Choose Love, keeping a children's hospital running for six months and helping buy food and other essentials for refugees in the Middle East.  </p>
<p>Imad has brought joy to hearts and stomachs everywhere. His warmth, hospitality and delicious food are now ready to have a permanent home in Central London. He just needs a boost to get himself set up. </p>
<p>In Imad's own true style, he’s committed to donating every pound you invest in him back to Choose Love, once the restaurant is up and running. He'll do this by donating £1 from every bill, and by hosting fundraising supper clubs. </p>
<p>Once open, Imad's Syrian Kitchen will serve a selection of Syrian mezze, including his famous falafel, as well as main and sharing dishes such as: Fattet Macdous, Crispy baby aubergine stuffed with lamb, topped with crunchy flatbread and a garlic cumin sauce; Watermelon, Halloumi and Za’atar Salad; Hamsit Lahem, slow cooked marinated lamb shoulder; Anginaar, roasted artichoke, stuffed with vegetables and much, much more! </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise 50k to get the restaurant up and running! The money raised will be spent on buying two new fridges, falafel fryers, dishwashers, tables, chairs - and everything else we need in order to open our doors to host our lovely customers! There is no minimum donation and <strong>every penny donated to this campaign will be donated back to Choose Love by Imad once his restaurant is up and running. </strong></p>
<p>We have a list of perks we are offering for set donation amounts - which range from a 3 course meal with drinks included to private supper clubs. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We acknowledge the risks and uncertainty associated with COVID-19 and we will adhere to up-to-date advice and guidelines as set out by the UK Government when we open our doors. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share this page and give what you can to make sure this remarkable man and phenomenally gifted chef can bring his magic to Central London. </p>

GIVE ONE CAMPAIGN PROGRESSWe are currently piloting our program in local schools in Georgia. Progress is slow and we are still trying to improve the program. We are having trouble getting into the curriculum in this time of year due to restrictive academics. The biggest obstacle we face in expanding this program is red tape created by some public schools and their reluctance to implement our program. This is primarily due to the low inventory we have and current reputation of our company. We are working towards creating healthy relationships and a more methodical approach to getting into schools.GROW WITH USThank you for growing alongside our company as we embark on this journey.

<h3>Peewee's Ice Cream</h3>
<p>Hello! We are Maranda and Bryan,</p>
<p>Peewee's Ice Cream is small-batch ice cream focusing on using local New Jersey ingredients.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2019, we started this ice cream dream. While both working full time jobs, we started our little passion project, never imagining it would lead to something bigger.  We wanted to provide our customers with fresh ice cream made with local ingredients.  Soon we went from selling a few pints a week to not being able to keep up with demand!   </p>
<p>One of our core values is that <strong>w</strong><strong>e believe ice cream should be enjoyed by everyone!  </strong>This is why we not only create dairy-based ice cream but also vegan/non-dairy options.  Once we have more space, we will be able to create even more variations such as keto, sugar-free, soy-free and puppy ice cream (just to name a few).</p>
<p>Since starting our small operation in 2019, we have been invited to more farmer's markets and had request's for birthday parties.  We can't wait to help celebrate more important events, community gatherings and farmer's markets with you this upcoming year!</p>
<p> <strong>So the big news is we</strong><strong> are opening our very own scoop shop and production kitchen in Medford, New Jersey this summer!</strong></p>
<p><b>Why are we doing this fundraiser?</b></p>
<p>Building this scoop shop is a huge undertaking but we are so excited about it!  Having our own space means we can produce more flavors, products and sweet's.  For example, we will be able to start catering parties, creating fun ice cream cakes and hosting special events in our space.  </p>
<p>So this is what brings us to why we are asking for your help!  We are raising money to purchase a new ice cream machine.  To give you an idea of what our current production looks like.....our small machine churns out 4 pints every 30 minutes.  The much bigger machine makes 50 pints in 7 minutes that can help us meet demand. </p>
<p><strong>Peewee's Perks: </strong>We have loaded our perks with some sweet treats (literally).  If there is something you would like to see on there, please let us know!  </p>
<p><strong>Thank you so much for your support! </strong>Community means A LOT to us, without you we would not be where we are today.  We look forward to being able to celebrate more, laugh more and eat more ice cream with you!  We are beyond grateful for all the help and encouragement we’ve gotten so far and we’re excited to open our shop in Medford! </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Peewee's Ice Cream</p>

<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We understand that not everyone is financially secure during this crazy time in our lives.  One of the best ways to help support us is to spread the word about Peewee's Ice Cream and about our campaign.  It is crazy how the simple act of sharing can be so impactful!  Even if you can’t donate, sharing our story and letting others know will help us reach more people and meet our goals. We appreciate you taking the time to read this, and for supporting our dream.  We hope to see you soon at 57 N. Main Street, Medford! </p>

<h3>Our Mission Statement: </h3>
<p>We plan to combine our unique passions for craft beer and yoga with the community we love.  Our award winning beers and comprehensive approach to the yoga lifestyle will offer the highest quality experience each time you walk through our doors.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569809395/jirwbdcc8feocuybhdi9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Plan and the Place:</h3>
<p>In 2017, we started working on a business plan and looking for a location where we could make our dream a reality. In the summer of 2019 we fell in love with the old car dealership at 302 State St. and began working out the details. We learned that the building began life as a Nash Motors Dealership in the 1940's and was later home to a Volkswagen dealership. This lends a bit of an ""art moderne"" flair to the old showroom where the yoga studio will be centered. Some of the original architectural features will be retained in the renovations.</p>
<p>We will divide the 5000 sq. ft. facility between the brewery, the taproom, and the yoga studio. With the possibility to expand into an additional 4000 sq. ft., this will be the permanent home of Gasper Brewing Co. and BG Flow Yoga. With a lot of work and a little luck we think it will be perfect.</p>
<h3>Our Beers:</h3>
<p>We specialize in all types of Stouts, Pale, Amber, and Brown Ales. We will also offer beer styles from around the world and will collaborate with the best in the industry to give our customers variety and provide something for all palates and preferences.</p>
<h3>Our Impact:</h3>
<p>Besides bringing amazing, unique, and highly drinkable craft beer to the area, we also hope to enrich the neighborhood where we will be located and spark growth in the local economy. We have been developing relationships with other local businesses to coordinate events, tastings, pairings, music events, etc. As the business flourishes we will also be looking to participate in philanthropic initiatives and different ways we can give back to the community.</p>
<p>It is our goal to introduce the people of Bowling Green and Western Kentucky to styles of beer and yoga that aren't currently found in the area. We will offer a combination of original Gasper Brewing beers and an ever-changing assortment of guest taps. We also plan to introduce multiple entertainment options for taproom guests. Speaking of the taproom, this is where <u><strong>YOU</strong></u> come in!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Contribution:</h3>
<p>We will be funding the majority of the renovation of the building and the build-out of the yoga studio with a combination of savings, current income, and equity from our home. We will also invest countless hours of sweat equity and do the majority of the renovation work ourselves. We currently have the equipment to brew 2bbl batches but are planning to have a 5bbl system in place by opening day or shortly thereafter.</p>
<h3>Your Contribution:</h3>

<h3>About Us:</h3>
<p>What started out in 2008 as a new hobby with a ""Mr. Beer"" kit quickly grew into a passion. I didn't really care all that much for my first batch, but I had great reviews from family and friends. I was elated to see people enjoy drinking what I had made, but also the control and manipulation of the process appealed to the electrical engineer in me. I knew immediately that brewing beer would always play a major role in my life. To this day, I still get goosebumps talking about the process and the possibilities. I absolutely love brewing beer. </p>
<p>In 2012, I met the most loving, philanthropic, yoga hippie while volunteering at a festival and soon after we were married. DeAnna was an activist, had years of community involvement with various non-profits, and was seeking something deeper for her life. We joined paths and decided to seek a better life together.</p>
<p>We moved to Colorado the next spring  which presented multiple opportunities for her yoga practice to deepen and my beer horizons to broaden. The next few years would see our jobs and our living situation change multiple times, moving from the mountains to the beach, then from the beach to a blueberry farm, finally coming back to Bowling Green, KY in 2015.</p>
<p>Once we established ourselves professionally in Bowling Green, DeAnna found some fulfillment by teaching yoga at multiple studios in town and I began acquiring equipment to brew bigger and better batches. We quickly made friends at Blue Holler Brew Supplies, the local homebrew shop, and joined the Bowling Green Homebrew Club. We started attending the meetings and found an incredible group of homebrewers that continuously inspire me and have helped me perfect my craft.</p>
</div></div>","Our Mission Statement: 
We plan to combine our unique passions for craft beer and yoga with the community we love.  Our award winning beers and comprehensive approach to the yoga lifestyle will offer the highest quality experience each time you walk through our doors.

The Plan and the Place:
In 2017, we started working on a business plan and looking for a location where we could make our dream a reality. In the summer of 2019 we fell in love with the old car dealership at 302 State St. and began working out the details. We learned that the building began life as a Nash Motors Dealership in the 1940's and was later home to a Volkswagen dealership. This lends a bit of an ""art moderne"" flair to the old showroom where the yoga studio will be centered. Some of the original architectural features will be retained in the renovations.
We will divide the 5000 sq. ft. facility between the brewery, the taproom, and the yoga studio. With the possibility to expand into an additional 4000 sq. ft., this will be the permanent home of Gasper Brewing Co. and BG Flow Yoga. With a lot of work and a little luck we think it will be perfect.
Our Beers:
We specialize in all types of Stouts, Pale, Amber, and Brown Ales. We will also offer beer styles from around the world and will collaborate with the best in the industry to give our customers variety and provide something for all palates and preferences.
Our Impact:
Besides bringing amazing, unique, and highly drinkable craft beer to the area, we also hope to enrich the neighborhood where we will be located and spark growth in the local economy. We have been developing relationships with other local businesses to coordinate events, tastings, pairings, music events, etc. As the business flourishes we will also be looking to participate in philanthropic initiatives and different ways we can give back to the community.
It is our goal to introduce the people of Bowling Green and Western Kentucky to styles of beer and yoga that aren't currently found in the area. We will offer a combination of original Gasper Brewing beers and an ever-changing assortment of guest taps. We also plan to introduce multiple entertainment options for taproom guests. Speaking of the taproom, this is where YOU come in!

Our Contribution:
We will be funding the majority of the renovation of the building and the build-out of the yoga studio with a combination of savings, current income, and equity from our home. We will also invest countless hours of sweat equity and do the majority of the renovation work ourselves. We currently have the equipment to brew 2bbl batches but are planning to have a 5bbl system in place by opening day or shortly thereafter.
Your Contribution:
We will be utilizing the campaign proceeds to cover carrying costs of the building, equipment purchases and leases, furnishings, salaries, raw materials, etc. 
In exchange for your contribution, you will receive one of our extremely generous perks packages. We have teamed up with a couple of Bowling Green's finest locally owned businesses  to offer not only packages that include our products and services, but also grant you access to their amazing cuisine and unparalleled wine and spirits selections as well.

It's the right pick-me-up to get the day started. And it's the right brew for those long work nights that can drag you down.It was our good fortune that we came across this Astoria Gloria Lever AL2-2 Group Espresso Machine. My male human saw the potential of having a custom made vehicle to tote this exquisite mechanical beast around to all those deserving people who love coffee. However, it was my lady human that took the initiative to design the graphics and came up with our official name Butternut Coffee Co. With me as the Spokesperson... or is that ""Spokesdog,"" I'll be able to keep a paw on the pulse of the city and together we will make the perfect mobile coffee team.To bring an eco-conscious coffee tuk-tuk experience to Downtown Los Angeles and the surrounding areas via the streets and special events.Along with our good fortune we have partnered with Ubora Coffee in Augusta, GA who will provide us with mouth-watering blends. This includes a coffee that is produced by The Hingakawa Women's Association in Rwanda. Plus, we have hired Grandmaster Mikey Goodwin (IG @mikeygoodwin) to train us in the way of the coffee ninja.While the Astoria Espresso Machine is being made run-ready, the kind gentlemen over at Barmoor Garage in Ryton, England are converting a 50cc Piaggio Gull Wing Ape Van to meet our specific needs. The Gull Wing Ape is essentially a tuk-tuk that has wings in the back that open up to an area perfect for our espresso machine, grinder, moccamaster, and cold brew dispenser. Did I mention... Autobot.The Butternut Coffee Co. tuk-tuk will look like this:We have invested quite a sum of money into this project to get the conversion started on our tuk-tuk. My humans have put their heads together, along with our conversion team, to get all the wires, water pumps, and everything else that's necessary to make this van, branding, and quality roasts from Ubora Coffee to come into fruition. I cannot wait until you have tried our 24 hour Watermelon Cold Brew. You'll love it!However, we do need your help to raise funds to finish the conversion and to have this amazing piece of machinery shipped from Ryton, England to Los Angeles. Once we pick it up, we will make the final touches to prepare it for the streets of California... to deliver to you a damn fine cup of coffee.Our funding goal is $20,000. That is the amount needed to cover the remainder of the conversion funds in making sure the tuk-tuk has the proper hookups, water system, power outlets, and switches to enable a smooth transition for the espresso machine, grinder, and moccamaster... making sure that everything is in working order. The funding would also cover US duties and taxes when the van is imported to the United States.We have included special perks to go to our special people who help us meet our goal: Limited Edition Illustrated Prints of myself
 Coffee beans for at home lovin'
 Having a drink named after you
 A ticket to the official opening of Butternut Coffee Co.
This campaign is paramount to securing the tuk-tuk that is being converted. If we do not reach our goal then we will lose the vehicle and all the work, time, and funds already invested. Special events are already in motion and we need the van in order to serve coffee at those events.Here is a small listing of where the Butternut Coffee Co. will be:
Ladies & Gents Night Out in Burbank, CA
Horror Trivia Night at Blast From the Past in Burbank, CA
Holiday in the Park in Burbank, CA
Hollywood Blvd. among the stars, and

Comic Con 2020 in San Diego, CA
After all, coffee isn't just about coffee. Coffee is about community and the people who live there. I want those who come by our espresso-on-wheels to step out of their busy everyday life... to know they are not just getting a cup of coffee; but, getting Love that is served with Peace and Happiness.My humans' long term goal is to be able to take other Butternut Coffee Co. tuk-tuks with the same set up to other cities, states, countries, and worlds. I wanna give a shout-out to my pups in Atlanta... I have you in my sights. I'm an LA girl though, and Los Angeles is the place to begin such a goal. As the Spokesdog for the Butternut Coffee Co. I do hope we can count on you for success.Every adventure has some risks and challenges. However, I feel confident that our team has the ability to take on whatever comes our way. My humans are versed in fast-paced working environments that demand meeting challenges head-on. They have worked in industries such as film/tv, graphic design, escape rooms, conventions, and food service.We thank you for viewing our campaign.

<p>Overview</p>
<p>Man Kup was created and designed in Valencia, CA. It’s the brainchild of serial entrepreneur, Gerald Taylor. Having thrown many ideas at the wall over the years, he has finally created one with the adhesive qualities to not only stick to the wall, but to bond to it in such a way that it has become somewhat of a collectible phenomenon. The pre launch consensus is unanimous. Man Kup is a slam dunk, and a bonafide must have accessory for every man and every Man Kave! Men everywhere are anxiously awaiting the arrival of this iconic piece of collectibles history. Never has there been a product with so much pre campaign buzz surrounding it as Man Kup. This kup is already in hot demand!</p>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556846376/jlh1l2pybimzs5xgqtgd.jpg"" src=""""/></div>
<p>Man Kup was designed with the man and his “male ego” in mind. Inasmuch as it was designed by men and for men, it’s in no way intended to project any form of male dominance or superiority, nor does it imply inferiority in reference to women. But rather a product that we as men can claim as our own with undeniable certainty based on the feature characteristics of the Man Kup design. Everything about it says “MAN!” The size, the name, the texture, the logo (kaveman mascot), and the handprint. We want the world to know that this product has a clearly defined target audience and an exclusive demographic that existed long before the invention of Man Kup. The Man Kave!</p>

<p>Man Kup is fun personified and visualized through the lens of artistic expression. We wanted each Man Kup to be a fun experience for every fraternity member. We wanted each kup to evoke an emotional response in the owner. That’s why we say that no matter what your affinity, there’s a Man Kup just for you. Each Man Kup has its own voice, and speaks to a particular audience through the internal conduits of passion and emotion. Man Kup is all about passion and emotion! This company was founded on those two extremely powerful nouns. We understand that most of the things we “want” are based on a strong emotional connection to that thing, and/or a passion for it. We are passionate about our sports teams and the schools we attend and we have an emotional connection to certain causes or movements such as Breast Cancer Awareness or the Wounded Warrior Project. There’s an emotional connection to these causes because all of us have been touched by what these entities stand for, either directly or indirectly. And when it comes to sports you need only to turn on your television to see the indisputable power of passion and emotion.</p>

<p>Man Kup Enterprises is currently in its infancy stage of existence. We’ve just begun this journey of creating and designing these innovative works of art. There are dozens of categories depicting some of your favorite sports, military and hobby interests. Man Kup has a virtual unlimited treasure of ideas for all the collectors and novelty enthusiasts. But right now we are featuring our Man Kup Natural Stone Series Kup in Prehistoric Stone Gray. It is our flagship product and the catalyst kup for all future Man Kups and all future Man Kup merchandise. When we conducted our “proof of concept” survey, all we had was a finished prototype of our original design which came in solid Prehistoric Stone Gray. That kup in that color was enough to convince our audience to endorse our product with an overwhelming majority in favor of having one of their own. Our initial release will consist only of Man Kup Natural Stone Series in Prehistoric Stone Gray. All “color” variations will be released at predetermined time intervals based on licensing requirements, and continued research and development of the technology needed to produce the Kups as rendered. The funds we raise from this campaign will enable us to develop the tools and resources to accomplish our tasks, achieve our goals, and deliver a quality product to our fraternity members as promised and on schedule.</p>

<p>Man Kup NFL: The NFL is an absolute beast of a business! What other sport has its own day where people nationwide gather together at stadiums, sports bars, in parking lots, and around televisions to watch grown men crash into each other for 3 hours every Sunday afternoon? The NFL brand is without question the most powerful and the most recognized brand in the world of sports, if not the world itself! That’s why obtaining licensing with them is so difficult. But that’s also why it’s so rewarding! All Man Kups featuring an NFL team logo will be available in 2021-22 due to the standard licensing protocol of the NFL Estimated release date: Summer 2022 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556846892/xybdfp3jgokyecd0zkn9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Man Kup NBA: The NBA has grown in popularity over the years thanks in large part to former players like Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan, and current superstars like LeBron James, Steph Curry, and Kevin Durant, not to mention some very strategic marketing campaigns designed to inspire interest in the game and it’s star players on a global scale. Man Kup Enterprises can certainly see the value and the income potential of being associated with the association! NBA licensing requirements are equally as stringent as the NFL. I won’t list them all other than to say that it takes filling out a series of applications, meeting all of their licensing requirements, and paying all the royalty fees up front. After we obtain licensing, the fun begins and we can now produce your favorite NBA team logos onto our Man Kups. Estimated release date TBD <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556847050/qhbxwxvgp6opelm0mpdr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Man Kup NCAA: The NCAA Man Kup series promises to be a fun and exciting campaign because of the atmosphere surrounding the college game. From the Saturday morning game day telecast, to the tailgating parties and sold out stadiums across the country, nothing compares to the energy and enthusiasm of collegiate sports. With over 130 FBS schools and approximately 125 FCS schools in Division 1, the NCAA is BIG business. Although you must have licensing to use any of the NCAA official team logos, the process is far shorter and much less expensive than the big four professional sports leagues.

<p>Man Kup Jurassic Park: Who hasn’t heard of Jurassic Park? Man Kup Jurassic Park will feature the iconic Jurassic Park T-Rex logo on our equally iconic Man Kup, creating an epic collectible Man Kup Natural Stone Kup in Prehistoric Stone gray color. This is the kup for the ages! Literally! With both logos having a prehistoric theme behind them, pairing them together was the natural thing to do. From a marketing standpoint it just makes sense, as both brands complement each other, being from the same genre. The Man Kup mascot is a kaveman and the Jurassic Park Mascot is a dinosaur, making them the perfect brand combination! There’s a whole generation of adults that were kids when the first Jurassic Park movie was released in 1993. And with each new Jurassic Park movie, legions of new fans of the franchise are being captivated as they imagine what life on earth would be like if these fantastic creatures still existed today. Man Kup Jurassic Park will be a magical ride through Hollywood as we team up with Universal Studios to become a mainstay in future Jurassic Park movies and merchandising campaigns. And with the worldwide appeal of the Jurassic Park franchise, and the power of Hollywood to market their movies and merchandise globally, Man Kup Enterprises will become synonymous with the Jurassic Park brand. Universal Studios, which owns the rights to Jurassic Park, has four theme parks worldwide, and it’s the vision of Man Kup Enterprises to become a permanent addition to their merchandising department at each of them. Estimated release date: Fall 2021 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556848024/iucvlgmxkvbswt6fkub4.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Man Kup Harley Davidson is one of our coolest Man Kups so far. It sports the classic “black &amp; burnt orange” colors of the Harley Davidson brand and roars like the sound of a revving Harley Davidson engine when on display. All the outlaw bikers and iron horse bad boys will want this one of a kind collectible in their saddlebags for those long cross country rides, a ride up the coast, or just a ride across town. As a special treat and as incentive to become an owner of a Limited Edition Harley Davidson Man Kup, we’ve also implemented into our Harley Davidson marketing campaign a monthly sweepstakes that allows our fraternity members to compete for a chance to win a brand new Harley Davidson CVO Ultra Limited Motorcycle. So, if you’re thinking of someday buying a top of the line Harley for yourself or someone special, you could own one for the price of a single Limited Edition Man Kup. Details will be posted on our official Man Kup website once it’s up and running and after we acquire licensing from Harley Davidson.

<p>Breast Cancer Awareness is a cause that touches the lives of millions of women and families across the country and around the world. Man Kup Enterprises has created a special kup that captures the essence of the Breast Cancer Awareness movement. The pink ribbon symbolizes the strength and unity of survivors and acts as a constant reminder to those that have lost loved ones to this dreaded disease and encourages us all to continue the fight to find a cure. Man Kup Enterprises has pledged to give back a portion of all proceeds from the sale of our Breast Cancer Awareness Kups, and to start a foundation that sponsors research for the development of medicines to fight not just Breast Cancer, but other life threatening diseases as well. If you or someone you know has been affected by this deadly disease that claims the lives of over 40,000 women, and over 500 men each year, you can show your support by purchasing your very own Breast Cancer Awareness Man Kup.

Man Kup Enterprises is currently in its infancy stage of existence. We’ve just begun this journey of creating and designing these innovative works of art. There are dozens of categories depicting some of your favorite sports, military and hobby interests. Man Kup has a virtual unlimited treasure of ideas for all the collectors and novelty enthusiasts. But right now we are featuring our Man Kup Natural Stone Series Kup in Prehistoric Stone Gray. It is our flagship product and the catalyst kup for all future Man Kups and all future Man Kup merchandise. When we conducted our “proof of concept” survey, all we had was a finished prototype of our original design which came in solid Prehistoric Stone Gray. That kup in that color was enough to convince our audience to endorse our product with an overwhelming majority in favor of having one of their own. Our initial release will consist only of Man Kup Natural Stone Series in Prehistoric Stone Gray. All “color” variations will be released at predetermined time intervals based on licensing requirements, and continued research and development of the technology needed to produce the Kups as rendered. The funds we raise from this campaign will enable us to develop the tools and resources to accomplish our tasks, achieve our goals, and deliver a quality product to our fraternity members as promised and on schedule.

Man Kup NFL: The NFL is an absolute beast of a business! What other sport has its own day where people nationwide gather together at stadiums, sports bars, in parking lots, and around televisions to watch grown men crash into each other for 3 hours every Sunday afternoon? The NFL brand is without question the most powerful and the most recognized brand in the world of sports, if not the world itself! That’s why obtaining licensing with them is so difficult. But that’s also why it’s so rewarding! All Man Kups featuring an NFL team logo will be available in 2021-22 due to the standard licensing protocol of the NFL Estimated release date: Summer 2022

Man Kup NBA: The NBA has grown in popularity over the years thanks in large part to former players like Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan, and current superstars like LeBron James, Steph Curry, and Kevin Durant, not to mention some very strategic marketing campaigns designed to inspire interest in the game and it’s star players on a global scale. Man Kup Enterprises can certainly see the value and the income potential of being associated with the association! NBA licensing requirements are equally as stringent as the NFL. I won’t list them all other than to say that it takes filling out a series of applications, meeting all of their licensing requirements, and paying all the royalty fees up front. After we obtain licensing, the fun begins and we can now produce your favorite NBA team logos onto our Man Kups. Estimated release date TBD 
________________________________________________________________________________________
 
Man Kup MLB: Americas pastime has a devoted, deep rooted fan base dating back to the early 1800’s. MLB fans are loyal to the core and they hold firm to the games original traditions more so than any other sport. Our MLB Man Kup Series is sure to capture the imagination of baseball fans everywhere as we recreate the historical logos of your favorite teams in vivid, brilliant colors. These Kups are built to last and make a great addition to your Man Kup collection.MLB has a very lengthy application process but it doesn’t require applicants to be in business for any specified amount of time. However there are some rather hefty up front royalties and additional fees to pay, in addition to a multitude of other business related questions, credit references, and contractual terms. Estimated release date TBD

Man Kup NHL requires a five year history of producing products and sending them out to retail establishments, and at least five years in selling the product that it wants to sell using NHL licensed logos. The NHL also states that its absolutely necessary that the licensing agreement be entered into with the actual manufacturer of the product, not the company promoting or distributing the licensed product. Estimated release date: Fall 2024
________________________________________________________________________________________
Man Kup NCAA: The NCAA Man Kup series promises to be a fun and exciting campaign because of the atmosphere surrounding the college game. From the Saturday morning game day telecast, to the tailgating parties and sold out stadiums across the country, nothing compares to the energy and enthusiasm of collegiate sports. With over 130 FBS schools and approximately 125 FCS schools in Division 1, the NCAA is BIG business. Although you must have licensing to use any of the NCAA official team logos, the process is far shorter and much less expensive than the big four professional sports leagues. Estimated release date: Summer 2022

Man Kup Superhero Series is probably our most fun campaign. It’s reminiscent of a time gone by when we were kids dreaming of having the powers and abilities of our favorite super heroes.

Man Kup Jurassic Park: Who hasn’t heard of Jurassic Park? Man Kup Jurassic Park will feature the iconic Jurassic Park T-Rex logo on our equally iconic Man Kup, creating an epic collectible Man Kup Natural Stone Kup in Prehistoric Stone gray color. This is the kup for the ages! Literally! With both logos having a prehistoric theme behind them, pairing them together was the natural thing to do. From a marketing standpoint it just makes sense, as both brands complement each other, being from the same genre. The Man Kup mascot is a kaveman and the Jurassic Park Mascot is a dinosaur, making them the perfect brand combination! There’s a whole generation of adults that were kids when the first Jurassic Park movie was released in 1993. And with each new Jurassic Park movie, legions of new fans of the franchise are being captivated as they imagine what life on earth would be like if these fantastic creatures still existed today. Man Kup Jurassic Park will be a magical ride through Hollywood as we team up with Universal Studios to become a mainstay in future Jurassic Park movies and merchandising campaigns. And with the worldwide appeal of the Jurassic Park franchise, and the power of Hollywood to market their movies and merchandise globally, Man Kup Enterprises will become synonymous with the Jurassic Park brand. Universal Studios, which owns the rights to Jurassic Park, has four theme parks worldwide, and it’s the vision of Man Kup Enterprises to become a permanent addition to their merchandising department at each of them. Estimated release date: Fall 2021

Man Kup Harley Davidson is one of our coolest Man Kups so far. It sports the classic “black & burnt orange” colors of the Harley Davidson brand and roars like the sound of a revving Harley Davidson engine when on display. All the outlaw bikers and iron horse bad boys will want this one of a kind collectible in their saddlebags for those long cross country rides, a ride up the coast, or just a ride across town. As a special treat and as incentive to become an owner of a Limited Edition Harley Davidson Man Kup, we’ve also implemented into our Harley Davidson marketing campaign a monthly sweepstakes that allows our fraternity members to compete for a chance to win a brand new Harley Davidson CVO Ultra Limited Motorcycle. So, if you’re thinking of someday buying a top of the line Harley for yourself or someone special, you could own one for the price of a single Limited Edition Man Kup. Details will be posted on our official Man Kup website once it’s up and running and after we acquire licensing from Harley Davidson. Estimated release date: Fall 2021

Breast Cancer Awareness is a cause that touches the lives of millions of women and families across the country and around the world. Man Kup Enterprises has created a special kup that captures the essence of the Breast Cancer Awareness movement. The pink ribbon symbolizes the strength and unity of survivors and acts as a constant reminder to those that have lost loved ones to this dreaded disease and encourages us all to continue the fight to find a cure. Man Kup Enterprises has pledged to give back a portion of all proceeds from the sale of our Breast Cancer Awareness Kups, and to start a foundation that sponsors research for the development of medicines to fight not just Breast Cancer, but other life threatening diseases as well. If you or someone you know has been affected by this deadly disease that claims the lives of over 40,000 women, and over 500 men each year, you can show your support by purchasing your very own Breast Cancer Awareness Man Kup. Together we can find a cure. Estimated release date: Fall 2020

Man Kup Budweiser is a campaign that just makes sense no matter how you look at it. Let’s face it, Man Kup is a kup that most men will likely use as their primary kup for consuming their favorite beverage. (I’ll let you figure out what that beverage is) And what better partnership could there be than with the self proclaimed “King of Beers” and the King of Collectibles. Budweiser and Man Kup are the ultimate power couple and represent a matrimony made in marketing heaven. Estimated release date: Fall 2020 – Winter 2021

This kup is “special!” Estimated release date: Summer/Fall 2020

<h3>Our *Community* Farm</h3>
<p>Our family has been given an incredible opportunity to build a farm from the ground up in the beautiful Happy Valley in Rossland, British Columbia. Because of the generous support of another wonderful family in our community we have leased 6 acres of ALR farm land to build our dream farm on. We are so excited to grow good food for our community and we know the people who call Rossland home are ready to eat it!</p>
<p>Dan and I (Miche) have been growing food in our mountain town intensively for the past 5 years, and have spent much time prior to that working on farms and orchards throughout the Kootenays and Okanagan. My career has had me working in various capacities in my local food shed since 2008 - farming, fruit picking, growing food, volunteering, managing the farmers' market, working for Kootenay Food, participating in agricultural forums across the region. For the past 7 years Dan has been studying bio intensive farming systems, permaculture principles for small farms, and sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p>It has always been our dream to have our own farm where we could build a space for food production that considers and preserves the environment, and opens its doors to welcome the community with a space for experiential learning and hands-on education.</p>
<p>Happy Hills Farm will be a diversified farm that produces nutrient-dense vegetables, fruit, herbs, eggs, heritage chicken and specialty handcrafted preserves. Our farm will be home to multiple greenhouses that will help us attain our goal of year round food production. We will also host the only farm stand in our community (open every Saturday morning!) to increase access to our food.</p>
<p>We plan to work with our local school to begin to introduce opportunities for on-farm education for students in our community. We have already begun to feel out this potential by meeting with teachers and a local outdoor educational organization.</p>
<p>It's important to us that our farm be a place of learning. We are developing a meaningful volunteer work program that provides hands-on skill building sessions and instruction on how to grow food here in Rossland.

<h3>What's A Dollar Worth?</h3>
<p>We want to share with you some of the things this campaign will fund and let you know just how valuable a dollar can be! Here are different ways your donations may be used:</p>
<p>$10: One bush, shrub or tree for wildlife habitat. One harvest tote.</p>
<p>$25: A first aid kit.</p>
<p>$50: One garden bed worth of season extension hoops.</p>
<p>$100: A salad greens washer. A salad greens spin dryer.</p>
<p>$250: An efficient seeder (to seed our 50,000 carrots). A sturdy farmers' market tent.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our farm will directly contribute to our local food system, by providing healthy, delicious food for our community and surrounding area. We'll enhance our local economy, help build a healthy community, and provide local hands-on food education opportunities for youth and people who want to learn about growing food (in the mountains!).</p>
<p>Each and every day we will strive to help build connections between people and their food. We think that the deeper we become connected with the food on our plates, the healthier we and our world will be.</p>
<p>On a larger scale (- a global scale! -) we are one teensy piece to a very large puzzle....but without us the puzzle is incomplete! Each and every small farm that exists to grow healthy food, build communities, strengthen economies, provide meaningful local jobs, and help the world learn about the importance of supporting localized food systems, contributes to the worldwide movement of health, sustainability, environmental stewardship and land preservation. Local food systems play a vital role in reducing our impact on the Earth, and our farm, although a small piece to the puzzle, will strive to be an exemplary model of organic and sustainable farming in order to reduce our footprint and preserve our beautiful piece of farm land.</p>

Our family has been given an incredible opportunity to build a farm from the ground up in the beautiful Happy Valley in Rossland, British Columbia. Because of the generous support of another wonderful family in our community we have leased 6 acres of ALR farm land to build our dream farm on. We are so excited to grow good food for our community and we know the people who call Rossland home are ready to eat it!
Dan and I (Miche) have been growing food in our mountain town intensively for the past 5 years, and have spent much time prior to that working on farms and orchards throughout the Kootenays and Okanagan. My career has had me working in various capacities in my local food shed since 2008 - farming, fruit picking, growing food, volunteering, managing the farmers' market, working for Kootenay Food, participating in agricultural forums across the region. For the past 7 years Dan has been studying bio intensive farming systems, permaculture principles for small farms, and sustainable agriculture.
It has always been our dream to have our own farm where we could build a space for food production that considers and preserves the environment, and opens its doors to welcome the community with a space for experiential learning and hands-on education.
Happy Hills Farm will be a diversified farm that produces nutrient-dense vegetables, fruit, herbs, eggs, heritage chicken and specialty handcrafted preserves. Our farm will be home to multiple greenhouses that will help us attain our goal of year round food production. We will also host the only farm stand in our community (open every Saturday morning!) to increase access to our food.
We plan to work with our local school to begin to introduce opportunities for on-farm education for students in our community. We have already begun to feel out this potential by meeting with teachers and a local outdoor educational organization.
It's important to us that our farm be a place of learning. We are developing a meaningful volunteer work program that provides hands-on skill building sessions and instruction on how to grow food here in Rossland. Volunteers donate their time while learning beneficial skills to use at home to grow their own food. Knowledge sharing, in our opinion, is essential in our quest for strengthening food security. We want our farm to be a place our community can use to expand our knowledge on local food systems.

<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
<p>Each heating pad is made up of a unique mixture of minerals. When water is poured on top of the pads, it goes through the fabric and reaches the mix. Thanks to the power of thermodynamics, that contact turns water into steam, which rises and condenses on the outer surface of the food container, transferring the heat to the food inside.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/3NMfZj48I2MRasnS19/source.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>That steam is what raises the temperature of your food up to 185ºF or 85ºC.</p>

<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/GFTJvfqn_hY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div><i>Note: this video was shot with a previous lunchbox design.</i></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The insulation of the lunchbox guarantees its inside is like an oven, heating your meals properly.</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629482596/mqhxj04heztrpwpjqlas.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>
<p>The heating pads release steam which heats the meals. This steam is nothing other that the water that is poured on top of the heating pad, turned into the gaseous state by the heat released.</p>
<p>The minerals inside the heating pads are contained by the fabric and do not flow to the outside.</p>
<p>Since the food is inside the closed food container (it comes with a silicon heat-proof lid), the steam doesn't even come into direct contact with it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1632312650/ybdrpqqmfyswzzrazgk3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Future Orders</strong></p>
<p>Post-campaign, you will always be able to order more heating pads through our online store.</p>
<p>We'll also launch a monthly heating pad delivery service, on a subscription basis. Through it, you can order the number pads you want for each month, and they will be delivered to your doorstep.</p>
<p>We're also in negotiations to establish partnerships with retailers to sell the heating pads in the United States, Canada, all across Europe, Eastern Asia, Australia and New Zealand. More countries will follow.</p>

</div></div>","Do you struggle with any of the following?

 
Eating from a lunchbox means fewer options for what you can eat and where you can eat. But we have a solution that’s out-of-the-(lunch)box!
 

Meet the water-activated self-heating lunchbox that can heat your food wherever you want. All it takes is one of our heating pads and a bit of water.
 
Just open the lunchbox and place one heating pad inside. Then pour water over the heating pad and put the food container on top of the pad. Close the lunchbox, and in five minutes, your meal is ready.  
As effortless as making cup noodles, but healthier.


So whether you want to have a warm stew for lunch, have a meal by the sea, or just avoid the long line at the office microwave, UZME is the lunchbox for you.
 


Camping

 
Park or the Office

Beach

 
Social distancing and other COVID-19 restrictions have forced many workplace kitchens to close or dining areas to have only limited seats available. This also makes the capability to heat your meals anywhere (particularly outdoors) a particularly convenient alternative.

 

 
Stylish
UZME has a bold, original look that matches its magical heating technology.
The default ribbon color is orange, but you can purchase an extra ribbon add-on (which may be useful in case you lose the original) and choose from an array of colors and patterns through surveys sent out after the campaign ends, to match your lunchbox to your style.

 
Quick heating
With UZME, you can heat up your meals in just 5 minutes - wherever you want. No more time spent in line waiting to use the microwave!
UZME’s fast steam heating method means you don’t have to sacrifice efficiency, health, or taste.
Enjoy fast food that won't make you feel guilty,
 

 
Steam heating
UZME uses a steam heating method that leaves food as fresh and tasty as when it was first cooked.

 
Insulated walls
UZME has a double wall design that concentrates more heat and offers more insulation than a regular wall, so that your meals get hot faster and stay hot for the longest time.
 
Leak-proof
UZME uses a double insulation mechanism where the food container has its own lid and is enclosed in the outer shell of the lunchbox. This construction ensures a tight fit and no leakage.

 
Dishwasher-safe
UZME is made of material that can endure high temperatures and strong detergents used in dishwashers.

 
Portability

UZME has a handle for easy transportation, and uses a double seal mechanism that ensures no spillage of liquids.
 
Easy packing
Today, there are so many options to heat your food, but none are as portable as UZME. Bring only the UZME lunchbox, a heating pad, and some water, and you now have the freedom to choose wherever you want to eat.
All you need is UZME.
 

Technology
Each heating pad is made up of a unique mixture of minerals. When water is poured on top of the pads, it goes through the fabric and reaches the mix. Thanks to the power of thermodynamics, that contact turns water into steam, which rises and condenses on the outer surface of the food container, transferring the heat to the food inside.

 
That steam is what raises the temperature of your food up to 185ºF or 85ºC.
 

Note: this video was shot with a previous lunchbox design.
 
 
The insulation of the lunchbox guarantees its inside is like an oven, heating your meals properly.

Safety
The heating pads release steam which heats the meals. This steam is nothing other that the water that is poured on top of the heating pad, turned into the gaseous state by the heat released.
The minerals inside the heating pads are contained by the fabric and do not flow to the outside.
Since the food is inside the closed food container (it comes with a silicon heat-proof lid), the steam doesn't even come into direct contact with it.

 
Future Orders
Post-campaign, you will always be able to order more heating pads through our online store.
We'll also launch a monthly heating pad delivery service, on a subscription basis. Through it, you can order the number pads you want for each month, and they will be delivered to your doorstep.
We're also in negotiations to establish partnerships with retailers to sell the heating pads in the United States, Canada, all across Europe, Eastern Asia, Australia and New Zealand. More countries will follow.
 





As opposed to eating out where you can’t control your portions, getting takeout and using disposable lunchboxes, or using a lunchbox that requires electricity, UZME offers a cheaper, healthier and more sustainable alternative. 
 

UZME aims to make hot, nutritious meals convenient and accessible to everyone, including the millions of people who still suffer from malnourishment today. That’s why, for every lunchbox sold, a portion of the profits will be donated to provide one meal to a child in need through the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP).
Environmental impact is another major concern which is why we will also contribute a part of the profits to plant one tree through TreeSisters, a women-led reforestation non-profit organization.

 
 

Similar to what happens with coffee capsules, we have a plan to recycle our heating pads through a collection point system. We want to have small decentralized recycling sites, where the pads are subjected to a staged, industrial drying process, which regenerates their heating potential. For us to be able to make this possible, we require substantial backing to purchase all the necessary equipment. We cannot do it just yet, but will put this plan into motion as soon as possible!

<li>
<strong> What is Indiegogo?</strong><br/>Indiegogo is a crowdfunding site, most often used as a launchpad for companies and inventors to raise funds for the initial production of their invention. This not only funds production but proves market viability for the product. Backers (that's you!) support the new product and the company by pre-ordering the product at a discounted price. The funds from Indiegogo campaigns are invested directly into the creation, production, assembly, and shipping of the product.</li>
<li>
<strong> What does it mean to back a project (pledge)?</strong><br/>When you back a project, you are pre-ordering the product. That means you'll get the product as soon as it's produced. Besides getting the product itself, you're also joining a community. You get to follow along with the production process, take part in important surveys, and give the company valuable feedback - often, your feedback results in changes and adjustments to the actual product.</li>
<li>
<strong> How do I pledge?</strong><br/>In order to pledge, click that pink button that says “Back it” or select a specific pledge/reward to back. You'll select your shipping country and choose your desired pledge level and reward, and set up your payment.</li>
<li> <strong>When do I make color choices/engraving choices and input my specific mailing address?</strong><br/>After the Indiegogo campaign ENDS on  7th August 2020, you will receive a survey by EMAIL where you will input your physical mailing address and make additional choices. This survey goes out to all backers after the campaign is complete.</li>
<li>
<strong> When is my money collected?</strong><br/>Your money will not be collected until after the Indiegogo campaign ENDS on  7th August 2020. If the project is canceled for any reason, you won't be charged.</li>
<li>
<strong> What payment methods can I use?</strong><br/>You can use any debit or credit card, such as Visa, Mastercard, or American Express, Discover, or JCB cards. Indiegogo does not accept payments with PayPal.</li>
<li>
<strong> When will I get my pre-order?</strong><br/>The Ecriture Perfect Knivesare set to ship out to you in November/December 2020. Depending on your location, you'll get them sometime in December before Christmas. Please note that this is an estimate, as you're pre-ordering the product and production delays could arise.</li>

<li>
<strong> Why AUS-10 steel?</strong><br/>We want the best of the best. Japanese AUS-10 steel is industry-leading for its hardness and durability while still being pliable and elastic enough for comfortable use and control. Our stainless steel Japanese AUS10 knives have HRC rating of 58-60, meaning it would always be ready to help you serve  the best food for your loved ones anytime!</li>
<li>
<strong> What is the steel’s Rockwell hardness level?</strong><br/>Our stainless steel Japanese AUS10 knives have an HRC rating of 58-60 on the Rockwell scale.</li>
<li>
<strong> Is the knife forged or cast?</strong><br/>The Ecriture Perfect Knives are forged.</li>
<li>
<strong> Why have the moving weight when you can hold the knife with a pinch grip?</strong><br/>The ability to control the weight and balance simply gives you even more control and then additional versatility - you can do more with one knife instead of changing to knives with different weights and balances for various tasks.</li>
<li>
<strong>It keeps moving like a pivot but how does the weight not interfere with hand motion?</strong><br/>We have tested the knives extensively both with professional chefs and home cooks. They change their grip depending on use and none have had any issues with the grip and comfort when using.</li>
</ul><p><strong>SHIPPING &amp; WARRANTY</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<strong> What does your warranty cover?</strong><br/>The lifetime warranty covers the blade and knives under normal use conditions. PRO TIP: Don’t put your knives in a dishwasher. Not only will it damage your beautiful knife, it also won’t be covered by our warranty.</li>
<li>
<strong> When will my Perfect Knives be delivered?</strong><br/>Before Christmas, but when you finally do get them, it will surely feel like an early Christmas!</li>
<li>
<strong>How long does it take to ship to our place?</strong><br/>All parcels will be delivered using Express courier service. Parcels will leave from either our US, French or Asian warehouse.                                               </li>
<li>
<strong> Is there VAT, duties or fees related to shipping?</strong><br/>We cover all VAT and duty fees! You just pay for regular shipping costs. Just select your country after selecting your pledge.</li>
</ul><p><strong>KNIFE ENGRAVING</strong></p><ul>
<li> <strong>Do you also offer logo engravings?</strong><br/>No, at this time we only offer text engraving.</li>
<li>
<strong> How many characters can I use? Do you offer font customization?</strong><br/>Yes! You can choose from 10 different fonts to write your 35 character message</li>
<li>
<strong> What are the fonts that you offer?</strong><br/>  You could find our font choice through this link <a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_RoZue284iQ92kEoHFbhWLzFvSU13O0g?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">&lt; click me &gt; </a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Can I adjust the size of my engraving text?</strong><br/>No, it is a fixed size. You can, however, choose out of 10 fonts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Can I choose different texts for each knife if I bought a Complete / Essential collection?</strong><br/>Yes, we want you to have the freedom to say what you want. The engraving is an add-on PER KNIFE, so you’ll be able to choose what each one says and the font for each individually (up to 35 characters).</li>
<li>
<strong> How long will the laser engraved etching last?</strong><br/>Your engraving is made to last a lifetime. It is laser-engraved and further above the sharp blade, so it should not rub or wear down.</li>
<li>
<strong> Can I preview my engraving before I purchase it?</strong><br/>At this time, no. You are able to specify exactly what you want it to say in the survey after the end of the Indiegogo campaign but currently, we do not provide previews. This is something we are looking into and trying to provide as soon as possible.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p><p>Because this isn't a tech product we don't expect to have big issues regarding production. The only delays could be related to quality control - we won't ship any damaged units, if something is not right we will make sure all defective units are corrected before leaving the warehouse. It might take a little time until the production line is fully operational and the employees know how to properly assemble the Écriture packages.</p><p><a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Learn about accountability on Indiegogo</a></p></div>","Everyone’s hands, grip, and level of control and comfort are different - so why do we all use the same knives?!It’s finally time to update the boring traditional chef’s knife! Ecriture Perfect Knives are designed to adapt to every grip and every level of expertise. We’ve worked with some of the world’s best chefs to engineer the “perfect” knife.

You can get as many add-ons as you want!**For the laser engraving customization add-on, YOU MUST list what you want engraved on the blade of the knife or knives you purchased in the notes area of your pledge. Up to 35 characters (including spaces).**Unlock these exciting options when the project reach the target funding below!Founders Pierre and Stephan, along with a team of engineers and designers, spent 18 months designing and creating prototypes of knives, looking at shape, feel, comfort, grip, ease of use, and more. With every iteration and every test, they came closer to perfection.Throughout the design process, we worked with and interviewed top chefs from around the globe to find out:
How they use their knives
What knives are most important to them and why
What is missing from knives currently on the market
What knives they use most and why
What they need from a “perfect” knife
 Ecriture came at this design process from an engineering standpoint, looking to create a comfortable, ergonomic grip and a blade sharper than other knives but still easy to adjust and use. We even engineered and patented Swingtech technology for the balance adjustment, giving you unprecedented control and versatility with every single knife.The result is a knife with perfect combination between contemporary and practicality that are designed for YOU.We have spent the last 18 months perfecting the design of the Ecriture Perfect Knives and are now ready to begin the production and manufacturing process. We have already begun the tooling for custom pieces and tooling will be complete by the end of July 2020, as soon as we reach our funding goal and the Indiegogo campaign ends.For the next 30 days, production in small test batches will begin, overseen by Stephan at every step. In September 2020, we plan for the first runs of mass production to start. Assembly and packaging will happen in October, and shipping begins in November. We have worked with our manufacturers and factories to ensure all of the Indiegogo orders will be delivered before Christmas 2020.The production process follows these steps:
1. Creation of molds and tooling.
2. Manufacturing and producing individual pieces.
3. Assembly in the warehouse.
4. Design and creation of packaging.
5. The product is packaged and shipped via international courier services.
""I co-founded Ecriture because I love the connection between food and family. Cooking a meal tells a story and food brings people together. I wanted to create the perfect knives with luxury engineering and design to bring more people together and allow every home cook and chef to tell their stories with total control and precision, all with a gorgeous and premium knife made for anything.""— Pierre""I love working with Pierre because our skills are perfectly complementary. He focuses on the design and I love working with our manufacturers and clients. Creating these knives to tell any story has been extremely satisfying and seeing how they are made and working with the manufacturers to get them to be exactly perfect is a process I truly enjoy.”— StephanWhen Pierre Regnault founded Écriture Kitchen, he laid the company’s foundations in the act of writing - that’s what the French word Écriture means.For centuries, stories and meals are how we’ve connected with other people. Food always tells a story, as does how it is lovingly crafted for the people we care about.Our knives allow you to write a new story every day in your kitchen. That’s why we innovate the way we did with SwingTech® - Anybody could write any story through their food with a knife that feels just right in their hands every time.Tell YOUR story of a simple Sunday family meal, a quick snack, or a feast with friends using the Écriture perfect knife set to create the perfect meal.Join our referral program :)You can make a difference.

We figured you could use some help! Send us a direct message and our customer service team will respond to you as soon as possible m.me/ecriture.kitchen

 What is Indiegogo?Indiegogo is a crowdfunding site, most often used as a launchpad for companies and inventors to raise funds for the initial production of their invention. This not only funds production but proves market viability for the product. Backers (that's you!) support the new product and the company by pre-ordering the product at a discounted price. The funds from Indiegogo campaigns are invested directly into the creation, production, assembly, and shipping of the product.

 What does it mean to back a project (pledge)?When you back a project, you are pre-ordering the product. That means you'll get the product as soon as it's produced. Besides getting the product itself, you're also joining a community. You get to follow along with the production process, take part in important surveys, and give the company valuable feedback - often, your feedback results in changes and adjustments to the actual product.

 How do I pledge?In order to pledge, click that pink button that says “Back it” or select a specific pledge/reward to back. You'll select your shipping country and choose your desired pledge level and reward, and set up your payment.
 When do I make color choices/engraving choices and input my specific mailing address?After the Indiegogo campaign ENDS on  7th August 2020, you will receive a survey by EMAIL where you will input your physical mailing address and make additional choices. This survey goes out to all backers after the campaign is complete.

 When is my money collected?Your money will not be collected until after the Indiegogo campaign ENDS on  7th August 2020. If the project is canceled for any reason, you won't be charged.

 What payment methods can I use?You can use any debit or credit card, such as Visa, Mastercard, or American Express, Discover, or JCB cards. Indiegogo does not accept payments with PayPal.

 When will I get my pre-order?The Ecriture Perfect Knivesare set to ship out to you in November/December 2020. Depending on your location, you'll get them sometime in December before Christmas. Please note that this is an estimate, as you're pre-ordering the product and production delays could arise.
If you have additional questions, see this helpful FAQ for backers from Indiegogo.QUALITY

 Why AUS-10 steel?We want the best of the best. Japanese AUS-10 steel is industry-leading for its hardness and durability while still being pliable and elastic enough for comfortable use and control. Our stainless steel Japanese AUS10 knives have HRC rating of 58-60, meaning it would always be ready to help you serve  the best food for your loved ones anytime!

 What is the steel’s Rockwell hardness level?Our stainless steel Japanese AUS10 knives have an HRC rating of 58-60 on the Rockwell scale.

 Is the knife forged or cast?The Ecriture Perfect Knives are forged.

 Why have the moving weight when you can hold the knife with a pinch grip?The ability to control the weight and balance simply gives you even more control and then additional versatility - you can do more with one knife instead of changing to knives with different weights and balances for various tasks.

It keeps moving like a pivot but how does the weight not interfere with hand motion?We have tested the knives extensively both with professional chefs and home cooks. They change their grip depending on use and none have had any issues with the grip and comfort when using.
SHIPPING & WARRANTY

 What does your warranty cover?The lifetime warranty covers the blade and knives under normal use conditions. PRO TIP: Don’t put your knives in a dishwasher. Not only will it damage your beautiful knife, it also won’t be covered by our warranty.

 When will my Perfect Knives be delivered?Before Christmas, but when you finally do get them, it will surely feel like an early Christmas!

How long does it take to ship to our place?All parcels will be delivered using Express courier service. Parcels will leave from either our US, French or Asian warehouse.                                               

 Is there VAT, duties or fees related to shipping?We cover all VAT and duty fees! You just pay for regular shipping costs. Just select your country after selecting your pledge.
KNIFE ENGRAVING
 Do you also offer logo engravings?No, at this time we only offer text engraving.

 How many characters can I use? Do you offer font customization?Yes! You can choose from 10 different fonts to write your 35 character message

 What are the fonts that you offer?  You could find our font choice through this link < click me > 


Can I adjust the size of my engraving text?No, it is a fixed size. You can, however, choose out of 10 fonts.

Can I choose different texts for each knife if I bought a Complete / Essential collection?Yes, we want you to have the freedom to say what you want. The engraving is an add-on PER KNIFE, so you’ll be able to choose what each one says and the font for each individually (up to 35 characters).

 How long will the laser engraved etching last?Your engraving is made to last a lifetime. It is laser-engraved and further above the sharp blade, so it should not rub or wear down.

 Can I preview my engraving before I purchase it?At this time, no. You are able to specify exactly what you want it to say in the survey after the end of the Indiegogo campaign but currently, we do not provide previews. This is something we are looking into and trying to provide as soon as possible.
Risks and challengesBecause this isn't a tech product we don't expect to have big issues regarding production. The only delays could be related to quality control - we won't ship any damaged units, if something is not right we will make sure all defective units are corrected before leaving the warehouse. It might take a little time until the production line is fully operational and the employees know how to properly assemble the Écriture packages.Learn about accountability on Indiegogo",71.0,0,"1 Campaign
