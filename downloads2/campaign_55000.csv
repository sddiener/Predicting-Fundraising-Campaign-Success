In addition, reflexology shows that the nerves in your fingers connect deeply to the rest of your body, so when using the ring you will also feel a wave of relief travel throughout your body.

<h3>The ""Why""</h3>
<ul>
<li>Natural skin care started off as a hobby. As I experimented with various formulas to try to make the best ones, I started to get interest from my friends and followers on social media to offer them commercially.  </li>
<li>By supporting my campaign you can help me turn my hobby into a side business that will help me fund going back to school. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I like to use these fundraisers (this is my 4th one!) as market research. Your purchase will determine which products go forward.  I've realized over the years after putting lots of money into projects that went nowhere,  that just because I like something or it gets a ton of attention on social media doesn't mean it's a financially viable or desirable product. </p>
<p>All the money raised goes into making the products ordered, getting supplies for new products.  Perks range from the products themselves to some of my personal artwork (some prints, some one of a kind) to items produced in previous fundraisers &amp; will be updated frequently throughout the fundraiser.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>My products are valuable because natural skin care is important.  Your skin is your largest organ, yet so many people slather it with chemicals that are then absorbed by your body.  If you look at the ingredients in main brands carried in stores, most of the ingredients are words you can't even pronounce, much less know what exactly they are.  </li>
<li>I have done 3 other campaigns for ventures and have delivered what was promised in each one.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>CLEAN YOURSELF AND THE PLANET </h3>
<p>On behalf of the Gift Wellness team, thank you for checking out our campaign. </p>
<p>A bit about us and what we're passionate about</p>
<ul>
<li>Gift Wellness was founded by Dr Zareen Roohi Ahmed from Derby, UK. She initially created a range of natural anion sanitary wear, which has benefited women from all walks of life, including women who buy our products; and women such as refugees and homeless women - who we donate sanitary pads to for free.</li>
<li>We're always on the look out for solutions to problems and ways that we can benefit people. Undoubtedly, the biggest problem that we all face right now is the pollution of our planet caused by decades of plastic waste. </li>
<li><p>Everyone is talking about how plastic waste is destroying our land, rivers, oceans and wildlife - but what can we do at an individual level? Well one of the main sectors that is responsible for single use plastic waste is toiletries such as shampoos, conditioners, body washes, face washes and hand washes. So our aim is for every bathroom to become plastic free!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The magnitude of what you will help us achieve:</p>

On behalf of the Gift Wellness team, thank you for checking out our campaign. 
A bit about us and what we're passionate about

Gift Wellness was founded by Dr Zareen Roohi Ahmed from Derby, UK. She initially created a range of natural anion sanitary wear, which has benefited women from all walks of life, including women who buy our products; and women such as refugees and homeless women - who we donate sanitary pads to for free.
We're always on the look out for solutions to problems and ways that we can benefit people. Undoubtedly, the biggest problem that we all face right now is the pollution of our planet caused by decades of plastic waste. 
Everyone is talking about how plastic waste is destroying our land, rivers, oceans and wildlife - but what can we do at an individual level? Well one of the main sectors that is responsible for single use plastic waste is toiletries such as shampoos, conditioners, body washes, face washes and hand washes. So our aim is for every bathroom to become plastic free!

The magnitude of what you will help us achieve:

Our goal is to create a cultural shift in every community and every household, to stop using personal cleansing products such as liquid shampoo, conditioner, body-wash and soap that are packaged in plastic - and opt for cleansing products in the form of bars instead. If everyone eliminated the plastic waste from their bathrooms, can you imagine what a difference it would make to the environment? 
The amazing this is that you won't have to compromise on the convenience or quality when it comes to our new range of cleansing bars. In fact they're so much better than the liquids. 
All the cleansing bars in our range contain Epsom Salts (excluding children's). Each bar is carefully blended with natural vegan blends and organic essential oils, that have specific health benefits. There are no synthetic fragrances and no SLS/SLES's or parabens. 
 Join us in this campaign and let's send a message to the big manufacturers that we don't want plastic packaging any more.

</div></div>","Short Summary



Innovate.  Educate.  Motivate!
What is STEMstick?STEMstick is an innovative, fun-to-use, educational technology system to stimulate highly interactive learning experiences for K-12 students.  STEMstick augments and reinforces traditional classroom instruction over a wide range of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) topics. STEMstick makes learning STEM fun. The STEMstick System is comprised of four main components:

Hardware (instrumented drumsticks and drumheads)
Software (system control, computational engines, and game-quality graphics)
Academic content (highly-interactive, standards-oriented STEM learning)
Concept visualizations (abstract & concrete stimuli-response lab activities)


The STEMstick (shown above) uses patented, advanced navigation technologies to measure and predict users' movements as tracked by a pair of instrumented ""drumsticks,"" using a suite of sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyros, and compasses) sized for a form-factor able to fit inside a big-barreled ""3S"" drumstick.  Users' movements with these instrumented strikers are translated into raw and processed signals, which are fed into a patented processing engine that drives graphics-based concept visualizations.




STEMstick capitalizes on the link between music and math.  “Active learning” is proven to improve students’ comprehension, concept retention, assessment scores, and motivation.  STEMstick will make STEM learning interesting, and help prepare students for lucrative technology-based careers, which often go unfilled for a lack of STEM-trained graduates.
We on the STEMstick team think the right innovative tools, right educational path, and right personal motivation, can help K-12 kids improve their Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) learning, comprehension, and motivation.  Hence our tag-line:
Innovate.  Educate.  Motivate!
STEMstick uses powerful, fun-to-use game system-like learning tools to turn passive STEM learning into highly interactive STEM engagement.  The user interfaces will be familiar to students and teachers alike. 


While the students use the STEMSticks to interact with the system as they would with a gaming system, the movements produced by the users are processed by our engine that drives graphics-based concept visualizations  

And what is the purpose of these abstract and concrete concept visualizations?
Just as a student transitions from learning about biology to experiencing biology when they dissect a frog, or transitions from learning about chemistry to doing chemistry by performing and analyzing experiments in a lab, STEMstick visualizations shift passive learning about STEM topics into actively experiencing STEM concepts intuitively.

STEMstick visualizations:

Are ""active learning"" lab activities

Are delivered as lesson plan ""plug-ins"" to augment teacher's lectures

Support the full spectrum of STEM concepts and topics

Are designed and produced to strict quality guidelines

Respond to standards-based, grade-appropriate learning objectives

Engage also the ""A"" for arts in STEAM

<p>Dear Donors and Supporters of disabled sportsmen,</p>
<p>My name is Wojciech Łukawski. I was disabled from birth due to cerebral palsy. At the time doctors said that I would never walk or speak. However, thanks to my parents, physiotherapists and some determination of my own, at the age of ten I made two unstable steps. Now aged twenty four, sport is my life!</p>
<p>As a member of the Beskidian Sports and Rehabilitation Union, known as START, based in my home town, Bielsko-Biała in southern Poland, I take part in the Polish National Championships in Para-cycling EDF Tour.</p>
<p>Soon I hope to start competing in marathons. However, to compete and win I need a new professional recumbent trike. At present I practice para-cycling on an English recumbent trike KMX Tornado. I have been training on this for 4 years doing 40-70 kms a day during weekends, and in spite of some necessary alterations it is now worn out and not speedy enough. My dream is to ride a VTX+ from England.</p>
<p>I have been involved in sport for as long as I can remember. Before I took my first steps I had been swimming and diving like a fish. Instead of using wheelchairs I insisted on riding tricycles and go-carts. Cycling has always given me a lot of joy, a sense of freedom and self-esteem.</p>
<p>I still have problems with independent walking, coordination and balance, but I have never given up trying to improve my competitive abilities. Perhaps people in other countries do not realize how difficult life is for disabled people in Poland. Support from the state is so poor that we ourselves have to collect the money for necessary therapies, rehabilitation and sports equipment.</p>
<p>I would be very grateful if you could help me raise the money for a new recumbent trike.</p>

collective. We focus on providing <b><a href=""https://wamm.org/medicine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">low-cost or no-cost organic, sun-grown cannabis</a></b> and comprehensive, compassionate care to seriously ill patients unable to afford the high prices at dispensaries, including those suffering with cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS, Alzheimer's, Multiple Sclerosis, PTSD, autism and pediatric epilepsy.<br/><br/>WAMM has eased hundreds of members through their final months by providing <b> <a href=""http://rahakudo.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">end-of-life care</a></b> through our sister hospice project, and we've also provided the medicine, knowledge and community support needed for many others to successfully treat serious conditions until they show no evidence of disease.<br/><br/>
<p>My own journey with medical marijuana began in the 1970’s, when my husband and I discovered that cannabis was <b><a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2001/01/half-ounce-healing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">far more effective</a></b> in treating my debilitating gran mal epileptic seizures than pharmaceuticals, without all the dangerous side effects. So we started growing our own. And then, after a pair of arrests for cannabis cultivation, instead of backing down, we resolved to help others facing
 similar persecution.</p>
<p>So in 1996, I co-authored <b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_215_%281996%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Proposition 215</a></b>, America's first statewide medical marijuana law. And since then, what started as a handful of seriously ill patients 
banding together has grown into a vital collective that services hundreds of chronically and terminally ill members through grassroots community outreach. <br/></p>
<p>That's why WAMM has always had the strong support of the city and county of Santa Cruz, but in 2002, the<b> <a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002-09-16-raid-usat_x.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Drug Enforcement Agency raided our garden at gunpoint and destroyed our entire crop of state-legal medical cannabis</a></b>. Several members died as a result of being cut off from their supply. In 
response, less than two weeks after the DEA raid, we gathered on the 
steps of City Hall, alongside the mayor of Santa Cruz and other local 
officials, to <b><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/18/national/18POT.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">defiantly distribute free medicine</a> </b>to members. Next,<b>
<a href=""http://www.alternet.org/story/15769/fighting_back_in_santa_cruz%3A_pot_patients_sue_the_feds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WAMM successfully sued the federal government</a></b>.</p>
<p>The garden was 
subsequently replanted, and grows more beautifully than ever. Most recently, we've been at the forefront of <b><a href=""http://www.vice.com/read/desperately-seeking-cbd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">providing high-CBD medicine</a></b> for children with epilepsy and other life-threatening conditions, and designing personalized, integrative cannabis-oil treatments for cancer patients.<br/>
</p>
<p><b>But now we face a serious financial crisis.</b> Without your help, WAMM could lose our home and no longer be here for those most in need.</p>
<p>So please read on to learn more about WAMM, and discover all the fun, engaging ways you can help us bring healing, joy, community and cannabis to those in need.<br/></p>

""For more than two decades, WAMM has provided the world's best working model of a truly compassionate medical cannabis collective. WAMM has also brought healing, relief and integrative care to thousands of chronically and terminally ill members—many who otherwise could not afford this medicine—while helping pass America's first statewide medical marijuana law. They've even survived a DEA raid, and successfully sued the federal government in response. Please join me in supporting WAMM and Valerie Corral, so this world-class, truly grassroots organization can continue their invaluable work.""

Fighting Back in Santa Cruz: Pot Patients Sue the Feds (Alternet)
Defiant California City Hands Out Marijuana (New York Times )
Pot raid angers state, patients (USA Today)
Half An Ounce of Healing (Mother Jones)

A NOTE FROM VALERIE CORRAL
Founded in 1993, the Wo/Men’s Alliance for Medical Marijuana (WAMM) in Santa Cruz, California is the world’s oldest continuously operating medical cannabis 
collective. We focus on providing low-cost or no-cost organic, sun-grown cannabis and comprehensive, compassionate care to seriously ill patients unable to afford the high prices at dispensaries, including those suffering with cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS, Alzheimer's, Multiple Sclerosis, PTSD, autism and pediatric epilepsy.WAMM has eased hundreds of members through their final months by providing  end-of-life care through our sister hospice project, and we've also provided the medicine, knowledge and community support needed for many others to successfully treat serious conditions until they show no evidence of disease.
My own journey with medical marijuana began in the 1970’s, when my husband and I discovered that cannabis was far more effective in treating my debilitating gran mal epileptic seizures than pharmaceuticals, without all the dangerous side effects. So we started growing our own. And then, after a pair of arrests for cannabis cultivation, instead of backing down, we resolved to help others facing
 similar persecution.
So in 1996, I co-authored Proposition 215, America's first statewide medical marijuana law. And since then, what started as a handful of seriously ill patients 
banding together has grown into a vital collective that services hundreds of chronically and terminally ill members through grassroots community outreach. 
That's why WAMM has always had the strong support of the city and county of Santa Cruz, but in 2002, the Drug Enforcement Agency raided our garden at gunpoint and destroyed our entire crop of state-legal medical cannabis. Several members died as a result of being cut off from their supply. In 
response, less than two weeks after the DEA raid, we gathered on the 
steps of City Hall, alongside the mayor of Santa Cruz and other local 
officials, to defiantly distribute free medicine to members. Next,
WAMM successfully sued the federal government.
The garden was 
subsequently replanted, and grows more beautifully than ever. Most recently, we've been at the forefront of providing high-CBD medicine for children with epilepsy and other life-threatening conditions, and designing personalized, integrative cannabis-oil treatments for cancer patients.

But now we face a serious financial crisis. Without your help, WAMM could lose our home and no longer be here for those most in need.
So please read on to learn more about WAMM, and discover all the fun, engaging ways you can help us bring healing, joy, community and cannabis to those in need.
  What We Need & What You Get 
In this initial round of fundraising, WAMM is hoping to raise $150,000, which will help us make significant progress towards staying on the land while continuing to service low-income patients on a sliding scale.
In appreciation for your generous donation, we're offering everything from a personalized email with photos and a special message of thanks from a seriously ill WAMM member you've helped, to artwork made by WAMM members, and even (for qualified California patients only) a special medical marijuana infused meal prepared by my 92-year-old mother, the famed ""Queen of Weed Cuisine"" Nonna Marijuana!

Note: It is possible to make a tax-deductible donation to WAMM via check, please contact wammvideo@gmail.com with inquiries.    The Impact Your donation will directly support our efforts to keep WAMM going and provide a supportive community that truly represents the compassionate roots of the medical marijuana movement.

<b>Background:</b> </b>Narikuravar is an indigenous community from the
Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Traditionally a nomadic people (Narikuravar meaning
similar to “gypsy” in English), the
main occupation of the people is hunting. However, they have been prohibited
entry into the forests to pursue this livelihood and were forced to take up
other alternatives such as selling beaded ornaments to survive. Because of this
oppression, the Narikuravar people are unable to improve their current
situation or increase their livelihood. <br/></p>
<p style="""">The major issues confronting the Narikuravas people
are poverty, illiteracy, disease, and discrimination. The Narikuravar people are often classified as a
depressed class, some say even beneath the Dalits (or the “untouchables”) on
the caste system. This population has endured mass discrimination throughout
history and still today, forcing the people to live hand-to-mouth, scavenging
for food, without even the most basic amenities. The programs proposed below
will help to alleviate the prevalence of disease in the area and improve the

It's your commitment to creating real change in fashion advertising - for your daughters and women everywhere.

You read the articles about eating disorders, young women being financially and sexually exploited, stick-thin models being told they are fat (by the very agencies who represent them!), ""plus-sized"" models being both attacked and supported.
You ""like"" the positive messages, you comment, you share, you sigh, and sometimes cry. Then you move on to the next post, the next email, the next text message.

You aren't indifferent, heartless, or uncaring. You want to see things change.


You want advertising to represent you and those close to you. You want healthy images in the media to inspire and influence the next generation. You want to know that high end advertisment in the glossy magazine didn’t come at the expense of a young woman’s dignity.
You've just never been given the opportunity to take real action to make a real difference.
We Speak is designed to empower and protect models, give designers and consumers a choice to make a difference, plus create an advertising culture we can be proud to have the next generation look up to.

The We Speak Revolution.


What we are undertaking with We Speak has never been done before.
Let me repeat that - THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.Never has there been an existing agency that can say:

We’re a positive body-image fashion revolution!
We advocate greater media representation for women who look like you.
We represent models who are health conscious and drug-free.
We look beyond size.
We protect our models from financial exploitation. 









(Sabina M. - above - is We Speak Health Approved!)


We know you’ve been waiting for an opportunity to make a difference. THIS IS IT.

There are just two things you need to do:

Contribute  


Every dollar matters. It’s easy to think, “someone else will do it.” We Speak needs to launch with funds from people (like you!) who want to make a difference. Choose a reward and contribution level you are comfortable with and commit. It’ll be easier than that first relationship you committed to!


Share  
The momentum of social media is vital to this revolution! Cats and laughing babies go viral. This message will do so much more than just make people smile! SHARE.


You'll know your dollars are working when you see our We Speak Seal of Pride in stores and campaigns. (It means they're hiring healthy models!)


.

Perks

100% Heavy Cotton TeeWho doesn't love stickers?
Help feed Shange! (Free range is pricey these days!)

   
How does We Speak Promote Healthy Living?
We encourage holistic health. Eating plenty of unprocessed whole foods and exercising is just a part of the equation. We also cultivate mental, social, familial, and financial wellness. Each of our models pass a comprehensive health questionnaire plus a doctor's physical before becoming We Speak Health Approved.

The Big Picture
$75,000
Here's where your money is going: 




$100,000 - $200,000
Let's aim higher! We really want to land an incredible partnership with select designers for a huge NYFW kickoff, and going even just a little bit over our ""goal"" will help us accomplish much more!

<p><b><i>Why Mental Health?....Because
UMATTER</i></b></p>
<p>There is not one person who has not
been impacted by mental health challenges, directly or indirectly. It does not matter if you are rich or poor; black, white, red, yellow, or brown, mental health affects us all. Just read the headlines...from over 900 deaths from mass shootings in the last 7 years to an  alarming number of suicides by celebrities and popular religious leaders including Robin Williams, Don Cornelius, Lee Thompson Young, and Pastor Teddy Parker. These are only a few names that have made national news. Think about the countless number of people who we know and love that suffer from mental health challenges but never make the headlines. </p>
<p>You or a loved one may have
experienced overwhelming stress, anxiety, depression, or a more serious mental
health issue. I am Dr. Sherry and like many of you, I grew up in a community where mental health was and still is a topic that you do not dare talk about openly. People tend to ignore mental health problems because they are often embarrassed or ashamed to deal with them.  </p>
<p><b><em>UMATTER Campaign</em></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Stigma is the number one reason why many people,
especially African Americans, do not talk about mental health challenges or seek help. It
is time to change that! Stigma is something that can be changed because it all
starts in the mind. The
Edge Empowerment Foundation and myself are excited to launch UMATTER, a
national campaign to reduce mental health stigma and increase awareness while
promoting mental health wellness. UMATTER (<u><strong>U</strong></u>nderstanding <u><strong>M</strong></u>ental
Health <u><strong>A</strong></u>wareness <u><strong>T</strong></u>hrough <u><strong>T</strong></u>echnology, <u><strong>E</strong></u>ducation, and
<u><strong>R</strong></u>esearch) is an innovative program where you can interact and hear
celebrities share their stories about mental health challenges as well as enjoy
music and other forms of entertainment. Multiple events are planned that will
be exciting, interactive, informative, and empowering.</p>
<p><b><em>The Need</em></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The need for UMATTER is great! Stigma is
embedded and perpetuated through family and friends, churches and other faith
based communities, cultural stereotypes, and media reports. We are our
brother's keeper and it is our goal to reduce the stigma of mental health by
creating platforms for everyday people. Combating mental health stigma is our
number one priority. We need your help in donations, sponsorships, and in-kind
services. Join us and make a difference in someone's life.</p>
<p><b><em>Testimonial........</em></b></p>
<p>I was diagnosed with Kidney Cancer in
2013, and I went through the process as if it was a piece of cake. Never
realizing that my entire life was altered with one diagnosis. I went through a
Radical Nephrectomy losing my left kidney. Openly, I wore a mask pretending that
life was amazing and secretly, I was a wreck, lost for words and I didn't know
how to feel and I did not have anyone to express my feelings to. I was
spiraling downward and I was literally depressed. I started seeing Dr. Sherry and
I found a safe haven, I was able to say the things to her that I could not say
to anyone else. I found myself getting stronger; I could say the word cancer
without wanting to jump off a cliff. She took me through the process of healing
step by step, she never judged me, and she willed me back. It is because of her,
I am back and now preparing to speak to those worldwide about life after kidney
cancer. All I can say is she is the best thing that has ever happened to me……… </p>

We need your help!  


         We'd like to open the gates this year.  Can you be a part of it, can you make it happen with us? YES!

We want to open a Therapy Center in Hua Hin, Thailand.  Everyone will be welcome. A place where people (and animals) can find professional help.

We are trying to crowd fund 229'000 USD. It is possible if everybody just gives a little. 

What's the plan?     We want to offer help.
Anyone can change and start a new life. Sometimes all it takes is a helping hand...


        
                                                                                                        ...to make you smile again!   



What the Center will be:  It will be the first Therapy Center in Hua Hin, Thailand. We will offer a variety of professional help. We want to help you change and have a better quality of life, because it's your life. Too many things can stand in our way to live a life of freedom. 


Whether it's depression or fear, post traumatic disorder, stress, borderline syndrome, anxiety, addiction, abuse, neglect or so much more. 
We just simply need renewal and healing in our lives, don't we? 


But how?


Let  ""All Life Therapy Center""  be the place you come to and find healing and restoration. We need your help to complete this vision.  Let me show you how:



                                                                              

What I do

So far, I have had a amazing career as a professional therapist and life coach (helped more than a 1000 People in the past 23 years) and I am ready to use my knowledge and skills in Hua Hin, Thailand. 


Presently, I work in Switzerland in a Institution with mentally challenged people as well as in my private practice with anyone who desires help.


I've trained and lectured many years  on various psychological topics at conferences and workshops or individual trainings. 



Animal Therapy

Additionally I treat traumatized  animals as well, that's why we call it     

""All Life Therapy Center"". Animals are  one of my greatest passions.  
Check our Website below or follow us on Facebook and see many examples.
   
     


What are we doing?  We want to open the gates to ""All Life Therapy Center"" in Hua Hin as soon as we can. We, my son (7) and I, have decided to completey change the course of our lives, dedicating ourselves to the people and animals in Hua Hin, Thailand.  We've spent many months in Hua Hin and  realized that there is a need for a Center like that. By sharing our vision and talking to many people there, we are convinced that this is the place we need to be.  There is nothing there like it so far. People travel up to 3 hours to find therapy.  


Also we would be able to improve many lives of traumatized animals. We've seen what a large amount of work that is.  We can only do it with your help and support.

The next step
We found the perfect house!   We have an accepted offer on it and your contribution will help us bring the center to life.          
    


You will help us secure the property and make the required improvements. Then we can  start helping people and saving the lives of the countless animals that desperately need us.  You'll help us build a place you can visit as well (contribute  your gifts - anything really).


Your contribution will help us create a place where we can offer various types of help. Therapy session indoors or outdoors, group sessions, workshops and  effective animal care. It will be unlike any center you've seen before.  It's a huge task, I know.  But if anyone can do it, we can.  


The center used to be a dream but it is so much more than that now.  It has become a mission and I will move heaven and earth to make it happen. 


LIFE  All Life Therapy Center will be a place where you can find:


Psychological, therapeutic, emotional help as well as counseling and mentoring. 




One time session or longer therapy 

Group therapy   (special needs)




We treat traumatized animals as well.  (visit my Animal care site below and see what has been done so far)

My book  ""Rejection Overruled"" could help you become what you were meant to be:  ""Free and happy""!
   



Understanding, encouragement and hope  
   The Campaign  for the Therapy Center
We need to raise a minimum of 229'000 US Dollars.   Yes, I know that is a lot. And that is why we cannot do it alone. We need your help. If everyone gives a little, we can make it!

This is basically ""start up money"" to enable us to realize the project.  
( 7.5 M Baht or  200'000 Euro,  or  218'000 Swiss Franks) 

 Be it $1 or $100,000, every penny gets us closer to our goal but it's not just money, we need to spread the word far and wide. Any ideas?





In more detail, the funds are needed for:

The House payment,  including the land  600 square meters
Lawyers fee's  and papers
Adjustments, renovations for the house. (Electricity, kitchen, furniture, outside renovations, garden, office)













And additionally we will also need to provide for:  


Visas and working permit cost

Travel costs                               and office supplies                         


Animal cages for transport  (medical care) and medical supplies
 

 Possibly some kind of vehicle

I'm a very athletic person, and love sports. 3 years ago I visited Sri Lanka for the first time. I instantly fell in love with the place and with the people. This past year I was able to go back, and an opportunity opened up for me to play soccer. I'm planning on going back in July though October. This upcoming trip is the ability for me to do mission work in Sri Lanka in the way I know best. Soccer. There are many organizations that do mission work through soccer, but there is no one reaching out to those in this country. Your contribution would help me live my dream, and help put a smile on a kids face. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Why do you need so much? </h3> <p>I know. $2500 looks like A LOT. It is. However my last trips plane ticket was a lot more than that! I believe with your help we can do this. $1743.70 is the current plane cost. The cost of living there is not much, and I've planned out $5 a day. That adds up to $2193.70 Now you may be asking, what about the extra $303.30? My plan is to use that for supplies, and as an emergency fund. It is also in case the ticket price goes up. <br/><br/></p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<div>Hey! We all like perks! I've come up with a few, and I'm always thinking of more! <br/><br/><ul><li><b>The day $5</b></li></ul>
<div>        This one's pretty obvious. I'm planning on a 5$ day expense. Donate $5 and I'll send you an email, or Facebook Message, or however message you want to tell you about my day that day AND how I spent your $5! </div>
</div>
<div>
<ul><li><b>The Retrospective $10</b></li></ul>
<div>
<b>       </b>The Retrospective is all about my last trip. For $10 I will send you a copy of my day journal! I was there from July to December, you pick a day, and I'll send you what I did! If of course I didn't write that day I will send you the closest one. </div>
</div>
<div>
<ul><li><b>The Pics $15</b></li></ul>

</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your donation, no matter how large, or how little, will make an impact in the life of a child. Whether it's the joy of playing soccer with a white kid, or the valuable things I teach, you will make a difference. In my last trips, I felt famous. I was the only white person for MILES around. I would make children giggle just by walking by. And when I spoke their language, it was even funnier. This is something every child would tell their parents. These children will go home and say, ""Mommy! Daddy! I played with a white kid!"" I represent you. I represent the United States. I represent white people. I won't let you down. I feel for these kids. They are my friends. I love them all. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There will of course be risks. And challenges. The first challenge is of course food. Nothing but rice and curry as far as the eye can see. However your $5 donation will help that, I also plan on packing food, and enjoying the time I have. Another risk is of course injury. In case of an injury that extra money could come in a lot of handy, and I trust the medical staff. I caught a really weird thing called Viral Fever last time. I went to the doctor, and got some medicine, and of course it helped! It was only $6 as well! </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I understand if you don't have the money, there are still many ways to help. Encouraging words mean A LOT to me, and keep me going. You also can share this with everyone you know! You never know who will be able to help make an impact! <br/><br/>There are plenty of soccer organizations as well you can donate to, such as One World Futbol. They give indestructible soccer balls to places that really need them. Having lost balls to the terrain of Sri Lanka, I'm planning on bringing one of these, even though they have no relation to me.  </p>

<p><b>Misty Artesian Water Summary</b></p>
<p>Misty Artesian Water is pure water filtered through Kentucky’s world famous limestone. Safeguarded in deep natural caverns, far below the earth’s surface. The unique thing about this water is not just the quality of the water but yet the bottle that it is fostered in an patented awareness ribbon shaped bottle and tinted pink to represent breast cancer awareness. This product was birthed from an idea by the founder of the company Misty Washington after losing loved ones to their battle with breast cancer. The idea of what if there was a unique “feel good” product that represented awareness, which many would be motivated to utilize and carry around, was created. Her goal with the product was to make it successful enough to generate revenue to drive support for these causes. The vision of a unique product to support the awareness of many causes was then conceptualized into the creation of the Misty Bottle of awareness. The product was then designed, patented, manufactured, and tested with great response of the beauty as well as the taste.</p>
<p>We believe our campaign is extremely important because we are on the brink of building a very successful company that will drive a great deal of financial support to many non-profit and charitable organizations. We have invested a lot of money into the creation and initial production of the product. It is so important that we raise enough money to complete our journey and make this a stable company that can continue to grow from the initial success and sell many awareness products, and in turn, donate a portion of the proceeds to these impactful organizations.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>With the Misty Bottle of Awareness we can create an impactful company. This product can be in every major retailer nationwide as well as support events created to bring awareness to the causes. There are many walks, marathons, and activities that people participate in to help drive and support awareness, with Misty Artesian water we will help spread that awareness while hydrating supporters. With your contribution we will be able to ensure that our bottle of awareness for breast cancer will be able to continue on a path of success and support. With your contribution to our campaign, you will receive product in return, with the only expectation of our $5 founders perk.</p> <p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We are in need of funds to finish current production and begun new mass production. Currently we have over 40,000 bottles in stock that need to be filled with our Artesian Water.</p>
<p>With our goal of $15,000 we will be able to fill the bottles we currently have; with extra funds from this campaign we will be able to meet the minimum quantity on new orders, lowering production cost per bottle.</p>
<p>In order to complete the foundation of building this company we need your help. Your help will allow us to build a stable company which then positions us to sell products that benefit this impactful cause and then be able to grow to support many other causes and charitable organizations.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal with this campaign, it does not hinder us from being able to fulfill your perk orders.</p>

<p>Nepal was hit by a huge 7.8 magnitude earthquake and several huge
aftershocks. The destruction and loss are heartbreaking! The buildings are
fragile! The loss is unimaginable! Millions of people are left homeless -
without food and water!</p>
<p>The suffering is more than you can imagine!</p>
<p>We have been personally affected by
this tragedy and have many family members in Nepal.  </p>
<p>As you know, Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, and it is
struggling to recover from the devastating natural disaster.</p>
<p>Please help fund Manakamana
Foundation to help the victims of earthquake in Nepal.</p>
<p>How will the money be used?  </p>
<p>EVERY penny and dollar will be used for direct support (food, water, medical
supplies, shelter needs, freight cost, etc.).  The fund will be used in
conjunction with other non-profit organizations. We are constantly communicating with

aftershocks. The destruction and loss are heartbreaking! The buildings are
fragile! The loss is unimaginable! Millions of people are left homeless -
without food and water!
The suffering is more than you can imagine!
We have been personally affected by
this tragedy and have many family members in Nepal.  
As you know, Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, and it is
struggling to recover from the devastating natural disaster.
Please help fund Manakamana
Foundation to help the victims of earthquake in Nepal.
How will the money be used?  
EVERY penny and dollar will be used for direct support (food, water, medical
supplies, shelter needs, freight cost, etc.).  The fund will be used in
conjunction with other non-profit organizations. We are constantly communicating with
direct contacts in Nepal to understand the immediate needs. This way, can we
respond quickly to meet the needs of the Nepalese people within a few days. 
In most cases money goes directly to on-site medical and rescue workers, so

<p style=""color: rgb(132, 112, 147); line-height: 31px; font-size: 30px; font-weight: 800;"">Why are we doing it?</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(169, 151, 181); line-height: 26px; font-size: 24px;"">The origins of the idea date back to March 2013  when my 3 years old son got lost for almost an hour in a mall close to our  house. </p>
<p>After freaking out for several days, I was telling the story to a few friends, we all agree that it had to be something to avoid these situations. Some people however, claim that they didn’t want just another  locator, they wanted a solution to help them to know when something was going wrong, an accident, a fall into the swimming pool… and also to allow their kids  to tell them if they need help.</p>
<p>The problem was that there wasn’t anything like that, at least nothing wearable, lightweight, comfy and affordable.</p>
<p>So, that’s how we started.</p>
<p>After that, we realized that there’re a lot of  people with similar problems, not only children, the population of elderly  people is growing year after year, unfortunately many of them living alone  (exposed to many potential risks), and an increasing percentage with some kind  of dementia.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many other uses, pets, valuable stuff, bikes… </p>

<p style=""color: rgb(169, 151, 181); line-height: 26px; font-size: 24px;"">When we first wrote down all  the sophisticated features that we wanted to be part of our device, we felt the  fear of not been able to accomplish our task, we got to understand what “risk”  really means, however we accepted the challenge!</p>
<p>No doubt, it was risky designing a wearable so full of technical innovations and micro-sized electronics, something so new that there was no road map or blueprint for us to go off of</p>
<p>At that time we knew a few  things about technology, apps and management but unfortunately we did not know  much about crowdfunding… because of that, and because we really believed in our  idea and the team behind it, we invested all our savings  in  developing the first and only eCall device for people.</p>
<p>Nowadays we have already finished and successfully tested all our devices, so we have got to reduce the many risks we started with, to almost just one, the minimum-order-quantity. This is why we need funding of no less than €30.000. Every additional cent it will allow us to scale down the manufacturing costs, and therefore it will contribute to the further development of amazing new features like:<br/></p>
<p>
   •     Medical measurements capabilities<br/>
   •     Reduce battery size while increasing its capacity and life<br/>
   •     Developing a full set of activity tracking features<br/>
   •     Introducing new materials (ie; Graphene) <br/></p>
<p>
  Our biggest challenge is to build today the wearables of tomorrow, and make your world a safer place. With your help we can do it! <br/></p>
<p> We want you to be the first to get your hands on PKid and we want you to share your feedback and comments.  This way, we will be able to finalize our first production.<br/></p>
<p>
  We can't wait to see what we accomplish together.<br/></p>

The Solution
A state-of-the-art way to combine  top-notch technology with the smartest methodology to build today the wearables  of tomorrow.

  A security device that will alert you in real time that someone you love needs you. It’ll tell you the exact position of the incident so you may act before it’s too late.

    Whether walking or in a vehicle, if you suffer an accident, don’t panic, we’ll know in real time where to find you.

    And for the little ones… switch on the Water fall alarm and stop losing your nerves in swimming pools and beaches.

A pioneering vision with a global approach to create a real solution for the people who looks after other people. 
 


 
With three independent localization systems (GPS, GSM & RADAR) and a Quad Band 2G module to guarantee connectivity wherever you are, you’ll be able to find everyone and everything you may be looking for in real time.
 
This technology together with the best and more advanced automated alert system, it will give you the peace of mind that you ever want it.

Different fears for different moments in  life

 
Perfect for Summer or if you are close to water
   Switch on the Water fall alarm and stop losing your nerves in swimming pools and beaches.
   

 
Whether walking or in a vehicle, if you suffer an accident, don’t panic, we’ll know in real time where to find you. 
 

 

 
 
 
An eCall system is not a simple way to locate the people you care about, it is a system able to alert you in real-time if something happens to them.
Some of the possible alerts that you could configure are:


In the coming days we’ll be adding a complete set of video tutorials about all these features. As an introduction to this guide, please find below the first video.  
Multiple GEOFENCE Zone Configuration
 A geofence is a is a feature in a software program that uses the GPS to define a geographical boundaries (a virtual perimeter). 
There are many practical uses. For example, a user can set up alerts so when a child leaves the school grounds, the parents receive a notification with the exact location as long as with the option to switch on an active tracking over the child.
Here is how to use the app to configure these zones:  

 
The Bracelet in detail

 
Adjust your band with the  different positions for three sizes. 


Slide the end of the strap through the Pkid.
Insert the pin, and slide the end of the strap through  the loop.
Slide the loop toward the end of the strap.



 

 

 

 

 
Give your child the space and time to learn about freedom… without having to grant it yet!

Why are we doing it?
The origins of the idea date back to March 2013  when my 3 years old son got lost for almost an hour in a mall close to our  house. 
After freaking out for several days, I was telling the story to a few friends, we all agree that it had to be something to avoid these situations. Some people however, claim that they didn’t want just another  locator, they wanted a solution to help them to know when something was going wrong, an accident, a fall into the swimming pool… and also to allow their kids  to tell them if they need help.
The problem was that there wasn’t anything like that, at least nothing wearable, lightweight, comfy and affordable.
So, that’s how we started.
After that, we realized that there’re a lot of  people with similar problems, not only children, the population of elderly  people is growing year after year, unfortunately many of them living alone  (exposed to many potential risks), and an increasing percentage with some kind  of dementia.
Of course, there are many other uses, pets, valuable stuff, bikes…

Our team
PlanetUs has brought together the best professionals in the field of consumer electronics, software development, industrial design and manufacturing. 
On the other hand, the founders are professionals with a vast experience in finance, technology, health and marketing.  
The four founders have been working together for the last 14 months on this project. 
 Michael and Javier worked together for +7 years on a different venture.
 David and Javier have known each since the university days.
Last but not least, Nuria and Javier met at the primary school when they were about 4 years old. Since then, they have always been friends. However, their future friendship it may depends on the success of this project…

 
Risks,  Challenges & Funds
When we first wrote down all  the sophisticated features that we wanted to be part of our device, we felt the  fear of not been able to accomplish our task, we got to understand what “risk”  really means, however we accepted the challenge!
No doubt, it was risky designing a wearable so full of technical innovations and micro-sized electronics, something so new that there was no road map or blueprint for us to go off of
At that time we knew a few  things about technology, apps and management but unfortunately we did not know  much about crowdfunding… because of that, and because we really believed in our  idea and the team behind it, we invested all our savings  in  developing the first and only eCall device for people.
Nowadays we have already finished and successfully tested all our devices, so we have got to reduce the many risks we started with, to almost just one, the minimum-order-quantity. This is why we need funding of no less than €30.000. Every additional cent it will allow us to scale down the manufacturing costs, and therefore it will contribute to the further development of amazing new features like:

   •     Medical measurements capabilities
   •     Reduce battery size while increasing its capacity and life
   •     Developing a full set of activity tracking features
   •     Introducing new materials (ie; Graphene) 

  Our biggest challenge is to build today the wearables of tomorrow, and make your world a safer place. With your help we can do it! 
 We want you to be the first to get your hands on PKid and we want you to share your feedback and comments.  This way, we will be able to finalize our first production.

  We can't wait to see what we accomplish together.

  Thank you for your support!

<p>Hi! We're Kere and Clare. Or Clere to our friends. Kere is a bit of an IT nerd and is developing our app, and I am a marketing geek and responsible for writing this pitch. We are also the founders of Run &amp; Rule - the ultimate competitive health app designed to motivate and inspire a generation of healthy users. <br/></p>

<li>Global obesity rates have doubled since 1980*</li>
<li>In 2014, more than 1.9 billion adults were overweight*</li>

<p>*According to the <a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">World Health Organization</a><br/></p>
<p>Obesity can lead to: <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Cardiovascular diseases (heart disease and stroke)</li>
<li>Diabetes</li>
<li>Musculoskeletal disorders</li>
<li>Some cancers (edometrial, breast, and colon)</li>

<p>The thing we find astonishing... There are over 40,000 health and fitness apps available, yet obesity rates are still rising! We're hoping to change this trend, by developing a competitive-based, fun, health app, designed for users of all ages, backgrounds and fitness levels. <br/></p>
<p>So, how does it work, you ask?
</p>
<p>Simply open the app, press 'start' when you begin your
walk/run/cycle, the app will track your activity as you go, then press 'stop'
when you're finished and see what territory, or Rule, you hold. (In order for
the app to work best, your track should start and finish in the same spot,
creating a loop.)</p>

<span>By
using Run &amp; Rule every time you go for a walk/run/cycle, you claim your Rule

<p></p> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1984, my family had a beautiful dairy farm in Oregon, it was an amazing
place to be a kid. Our family had been farming for 70+ years. And in 1992 we
had to leave the farm, move to Washington State, and live below the poverty level to qualify for help with the cost a lifesaving medication I needed to
treat a genetic disease called Gaucher. I was eight at the time, doctors had told my mother I would probably only live to be 8 or 9.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432761327/jbdyrtj0fyvffg3pe9wm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Having to leave the
farm was hard for everyone. Though my mom, two sisters, and I were able to each keep a couple of our
favorite cows they had to stay on other farms ever since. Over the years
those cows have had calves, some of those calves became cows and they had
calves, and like everyone some of them have gone on now to the milky way in the
sky.</p>
<p>In February of 2014 my mom and I were able to rent a home on 10 acres, and now thankfully are able to raise and care for our calves and a
couple nurse cows. A long awaited desire after 23 years of living places where that
was not possible. Until recent healthcare laws changed I still had to live below the poverty level to qualify for help with the cost of my medicine.</p>
<p>Now we have the opportunity to start farming again. And have dreams of bottling raw milk, making cheese and seeing all of our
cows and heifers grazing and playing on pastures. On the farm we would raise our animals in
a clean, natural and humane environment where they will have access to fresh
pasture at all times. The animals will be loved on and cared for like they are part of
the family, because they are. </p>
<p>We hope to make
Bossy Acres Farm a place where families can come and meet the animals where their
milk is coming from. We hope to raise part of our start up costs to ensure we
have a solid foundation and the tools we need to be able to offer high quality raw
milk and dairy products. If we can raise more than our minimum goal we will use
that money in the best ways to get MATCHING FUNDS, create jobs, help Veterans suffering from PTSD, and internships for those interested in
4H and FFA.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432351650/qrlpetorqfrz7nefagdd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are applying (APPLICATION DEADLINE JULY 2015) and can get matching funds through the
USDA’s Value Added Producer Grant for eligible expenses such as bottles,
labels, bottling employee salary,
utilities, and marketing. So for each dollar we get and spend towards those items,
we can get a dollar back, making your contributions go even further.  Supporting our campaign also gives you our appreciation
forever and the chance to say “you were there when Bossy Acres became a farm
again.”  </p>
<p></p>
<p>We have a vision of
creating a CSA (community supported agriculture) style farm. In which members
can not only get wholesome natural food, but also share in the experiences and joys of farming.</p>

<h3>What We Need To Get Started</h3>

<p>Raw milk is enzyme and
vitamin superior to conventionally pasteurized milk. In numerous health studies
and private claims, it has been used to treat diseases and others elements.
This could be due to the high profile nutrients that exist in raw cow milk that
are identical to those found in human breast milk. Of course like with any product
you eat you should make sure the raw milk you drink comes from well cared for
cows and is produced in a clean environment. And the farm, the milking process, and
equipment is up to quality standards and is licensed. You should take care to keep the raw milk in the fridge (32 degrees is optimal) much like other raw products in
your kitchen. Quality Raw Milk can do your body good and provide powerful
enzymes and vitamins your body can use to build strong bones, lean muscles, and
a strong immune system. </p>

</div></div>","Once Upon a Time, We had a Farm
 


In 1984, my family had a beautiful dairy farm in Oregon, it was an amazing
place to be a kid. Our family had been farming for 70+ years. And in 1992 we
had to leave the farm, move to Washington State, and live below the poverty level to qualify for help with the cost a lifesaving medication I needed to
treat a genetic disease called Gaucher. I was eight at the time, doctors had told my mother I would probably only live to be 8 or 9.



Having to leave the
farm was hard for everyone. Though my mom, two sisters, and I were able to each keep a couple of our
favorite cows they had to stay on other farms ever since. Over the years
those cows have had calves, some of those calves became cows and they had
calves, and like everyone some of them have gone on now to the milky way in the
sky.
In February of 2014 my mom and I were able to rent a home on 10 acres, and now thankfully are able to raise and care for our calves and a
couple nurse cows. A long awaited desire after 23 years of living places where that
was not possible. Until recent healthcare laws changed I still had to live below the poverty level to qualify for help with the cost of my medicine.
Now we have the opportunity to start farming again. And have dreams of bottling raw milk, making cheese and seeing all of our
cows and heifers grazing and playing on pastures. On the farm we would raise our animals in
a clean, natural and humane environment where they will have access to fresh
pasture at all times. The animals will be loved on and cared for like they are part of
the family, because they are. 
We hope to make
Bossy Acres Farm a place where families can come and meet the animals where their
milk is coming from. We hope to raise part of our start up costs to ensure we
have a solid foundation and the tools we need to be able to offer high quality raw
milk and dairy products. If we can raise more than our minimum goal we will use
that money in the best ways to get MATCHING FUNDS, create jobs, help Veterans suffering from PTSD, and internships for those interested in
4H and FFA.


We are applying (APPLICATION DEADLINE JULY 2015) and can get matching funds through the
USDA’s Value Added Producer Grant for eligible expenses such as bottles,
labels, bottling employee salary,
utilities, and marketing. So for each dollar we get and spend towards those items,
we can get a dollar back, making your contributions go even further.  Supporting our campaign also gives you our appreciation
forever and the chance to say “you were there when Bossy Acres became a farm
again.”  

We have a vision of
creating a CSA (community supported agriculture) style farm. In which members
can not only get wholesome natural food, but also share in the experiences and joys of farming.


What We Need To Get Started
 
Hire farm hands - Looking for those who have a heart for working outside with animals. Also an interest in cheese making and raw milk is a plus. Working with animals in a outside environment has been effective at helping people suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD)  








Lease 40+ acres of pasture land - Grass fed, pasture raised cows produce milk higher in omega-3's, CLA, beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin K, vitamin D, vitamin E, and antioxidants. Plus they love it!





Custom Animal Shelter - Housings for animals to get out of the weather, plus used bed-pack is composted and used for gardening and to sell.





Construct Mobile Milking Parlor and Bottling Room - Clean Brand New milking & bottling equipment will help produce quality raw milk. 




6 Kleen Flo 300 Milking units $1134 - 6 65lb Waikato Milk Meters $1554
100ft 1in Silicone Milk Hose $1269 - 7.5HP Vacuum Pump Package $3289
5K Commander Vacuum Reg. $489 - 40ft Shipping Container $2,000
Stanchions and Gates Pipe $1,000 - Stainless Steel Bulk Milk Tank $2,000
Stainless Steel Milk Pipe $Purchased - Stainless Steel Plate Cooler $Purchased 



Bottling Equipment 




Single-Valve Filler $7,900 - 114 AMCO Pump $2,000  - Controller $3,000




The Bigger Picture






A place where families can come and meet the animals their milk is coming from. With opportunities to get involved and make friends.









Grow and sell vegetables grown in our natural compost made from recycling the bed-pack. Great natural fertilizer, smells just like dirt!









Create internships for those interested in 4H and FFA. 









Get matching funds through the USDA’s Value Added Producer
Grant.






 Risks & Challenges


The Washington
State Department of Agriculture agency said retail raw milk is legal to sell in
Washington, but there are serious health risks. It reminded consumers they should
read the warning label on the retail raw milk container carefully and make an

""WARNING: This product has not been pasteurized and may contain harmful bacteria. Pregnant women, children, the elderly and persons with lowered resistance to disease have the highest risk of harm from use of this product.""



Educating people on the health risk involved with raw foods is important, and raw cows milk can be dangerous if proper animal care, clean milking equipment, and product handling are not taken seriously. But with a quality product and good handling care, raw milk has many health benefits. More people are sicken from eating raw greens every year than drinking raw milk, but you shouldn't stop eating salads. It starts with knowing where your food is coming from and proper storage to protect yourself from illness that can be caused by food.

<h3>What about learning?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Unfortunately numerous teachers in Africa
are under-qualified or lack accurate training. It’s one of the major issues of
the education process in Africa. The project KWIIZI is doing more than just
giving content to students and teachers. It also has a focus on teaching best
practices. Through the OER4School program integrated to the KwiiziBox, teachers
are able to learn the best practices to give courses and get a better
understanding of their students level.</p>
<p>The KwiiziBox objective is to make
information available without internet and give a new experience of files
sharing. The databases includes Wikipedia and could be installed in
Schools, public librairies offering access
to education to people with low income and even rural areas without internet.</p>
<p>All is in a little box you can have in
your pocket! We think about environment so the Kwiizi box could also be powered
by solar energy! We really need you to make this dream come true! We are at one
step to build something which will help an entire generation of African
students, we want you to be part of this amazing adventure. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The KwiiziBox objective is to make information available
without internet and provide a complete new sharing experience. The database
could be included in schools and rural areas, providing access to millions of
books and videos.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h3>How We’ll USE THE MONEY</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The kwiizi project and his kwiizi box wants to be able to
connect schools and universities. We need to build more kwiizibox by school to
interconnect them through a local network.</p>
<p>If we have <b> 5000 USD we will be able to provide a
Kwiizibox to 20 institutions! </b></p>
<p>If we reach <b>10.000
UDS we will be able to connect schools in many cities! </b></p>
<p><b>IF WE REACH 100.000 USD, THIS IS AMAZING! We will have a national
network and get a new office! We will be able to leave more space for other
startups in our incubator! :D</b></p>
<br/><br/><h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Internet in Africa is limited by a penetration rate of 18 %. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>People have a better
access to education but they lack accurate training. Technology is a great path
between a better local economy and a great skills improvement which is possible
with the information access.</p>
<p>By supporting this
project, you contribute to the technological emancipation of all the African
continent with a solution created by Africans which could also work EVERYWHERE!</p>

For
the next billion people connected to the web, do you want to contribute to
local networks before internet comes in those areas? It’s already working, let
us make history together. We are the world.</div><div>

<p><b>Mais qu’en est-il de l’enseignement ?</b></p>
<p>De nombreux enseignants en Afrique sont sous qualifiés ou n’ont pas
été bien formés dans ce métier. Cela est un inconvénient majeur dans la chaîne éducative.
Le projet Kwiizi ne se contente pas seulement de délivrer du contenu éducatif aux
élèves, étudiants ou professeurs, mais  aussi de mettre l’accent sur les méthodes
pédagogiques de l’enseignement. Via le programme OER4school intégré à la
KwiiziBox , les enseignants apprennent à mieux dispenser leurs cours et
maîtriser au mieux le niveau de leurs apprenants.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Les objectifs  de la
KwiiziBox sont de rendre l’information disponible sans connexion internet et
offrir une nouvelle expérience de partage de ces informations. Sa base de données qui incorpore aussi
celle de Wikipedia, peut être installée dans des milieux scolaires et dans des
bibliothèques municipales, et permettre ainsi de mettre à la disposition des élèves, un accès à des millions d’articles, livres et vidéos même dans des zones sans

PRESENTATION


The KwiiziBox is a credit-card sized
box containing a complete media-center which gives access to a lot of educative
content including 7 million articles,videos of TED talks and a specialized medical
database. It also allows you to make video calls and share files, all for FREE
and WITHOUT AN INTERNET CONNECTION
The KwiiziBox is able to share content through a mobile application with an integrated Wi-Fi.
For large scale universities, the KwiiziBox can be easily paired to one or more Wi-Fi devices for betternetwork coverage and network quality for students and researchers.




You can also access just
by using your web browser on a computer, a tablet or even a smartphone! 
African educational Institutions using the KwiiziBox can interconnect to build an e-Learning platform without an internet connection. It’s like a local intranet where all African schools will be able to share documents, research and communicate amongst each other.
The KwiiziBox and its native
application include :
- 
More than 7 000 000 articles (Wikipedia
database) ;
- 
45 000
books (Gutenberg Library) ;
- 
More
than 8000 video courses (MOOC, TED conferences, documentaries) ;
- 
Free Video calls and File sharing tools
- 
ShareScreen functionality to allow users to discuss
and work on a project in real time
- 
Offline mode allowing users outside of the KwiiziBox
network to be able to check from home all the articles they already read in the
network
- 
Social : Users can
chat on one or more articles, add them as favorites, allow users to follow in
live their article readings.
- 
Multilingual (French and English included) ;
- 
Simple and Intuitive






What about learning?

Unfortunately numerous teachers in Africa
are under-qualified or lack accurate training. It’s one of the major issues of
the education process in Africa. The project KWIIZI is doing more than just
giving content to students and teachers. It also has a focus on teaching best
practices. Through the OER4School program integrated to the KwiiziBox, teachers
are able to learn the best practices to give courses and get a better
understanding of their students level.
The KwiiziBox objective is to make
information available without internet and give a new experience of files
sharing. The databases includes Wikipedia and could be installed in
Schools, public librairies offering access
to education to people with low income and even rural areas without internet.
All is in a little box you can have in
your pocket! We think about environment so the Kwiizi box could also be powered
by solar energy! We really need you to make this dream come true! We are at one
step to build something which will help an entire generation of African
students, we want you to be part of this amazing adventure. 

The KwiiziBox objective is to make information available
without internet and provide a complete new sharing experience. The database
could be included in schools and rural areas, providing access to millions of
books and videos.





How We’ll USE THE MONEY

The kwiizi project and his kwiizi box wants to be able to
connect schools and universities. We need to build more kwiizibox by school to
interconnect them through a local network.
If we have  5000 USD we will be able to provide a
Kwiizibox to 20 institutions! 
If we reach 10.000
UDS we will be able to connect schools in many cities! 
IF WE REACH 100.000 USD, THIS IS AMAZING! We will have a national
network and get a new office! We will be able to leave more space for other
startups in our incubator! :D
THE IMPACT

The Internet in Africa is limited by a penetration rate of 18 %. 

People have a better
access to education but they lack accurate training. Technology is a great path
between a better local economy and a great skills improvement which is possible
with the information access.
By supporting this
project, you contribute to the technological emancipation of all the African
continent with a solution created by Africans which could also work EVERYWHERE!

For
the next billion people connected to the web, do you want to contribute to
local networks before internet comes in those areas? It’s already working, let
us make history together. We are the world.

THEY TALK ABOUT US
We are glad and really happy to get the local and international web and TV medias support for KWIIZI project .

A quoi servira la collecte ?

Le projet Kwiizi et sa KwiiziBox s’apprête à équiper
un plus grand nombre d'écoles secondaires et supérieures. Il y a besoin de
produire plus de KwiiziBox par école  et interconnecter ces institutions
par un réseau local.
La collecte de 5000 USD servira à produire plus de
KwiiziBox et mettre en place un réseau interne ne dépendant pas d'internet pour
faire communiquer tous les acteurs du secteur éducatif (élèves, étudiants, enseignants).
Avec seulement 250 USD, une école secondaire ou
supérieure peut être équipé d’une KwiiziBox. C’est extrêmement moins cher et économique
en énergie.
5000 USD nous permettront d’équiper un minimum de 20
institutions.
Avec plus de 10 000 USD, nous assurons plus d’institutions
scolaires dans plusieurs villes sans accès véritable à internet.
Si nous parvenons jusqu’à 100 000 USD, le réseau sera plus étendu et plus influent et ainsi nous pourrons avoir
en bonus notre propre local laissant de la place chez notre incubateur.

L'impact

Aujourd’hui le taux de pénétration d'internet en Afrique est de
18%.
Le taux d'enfants scolarisés augmente mais les
outils de formations manquent cruellement. La technologie est la chose qui
combine meilleur marché et formation de qualité supérieure.
En y mettant de vous sur ce projet, vous allez une
fois de plus marquer votre passage et contribuer à l’essor technologique de l’Afrique
avec une solution adaptée pour l’Afrique et qui peut très bien marcher  ailleurs.
Pour le prochain milliard de connecter à internet,
voulez vous contribuer à faire des réseaux locaux en attendant la venue de l’internet
dans ces zones ? Nous avons trouvé une solution qui est déjà utilisé et appréciée,
contribuons  ensemble pour allez plus vite et plus loin.

Yoga does indeed connect, and that’s exactly what this festival was doing”. The festival was true success in my opinion. It brought together people from all over the world and allowed them to connect through a shared love of yoga, and the number of people there was Goldilocks for me – just the right amount. Whilst I have no doubt this event will grow to be even bigger and better in the years to come, I’m glad I went to this first one as, whilst it was grand, it still felt intimate. <strong>Dare to Move Blog</strong></p><p>“Yoga Connects Festival is perfectly named for the atmosphere it managed to create. Everywhere you looked, people were exploring what yoga and connection meant to them. Rarely have I had the pleasure of being in the presence of so many soulful, loving, compassionate, generous and open hearted people. The festival was pure magic, fuelled by love and passion for yoga and connection that it facilitates”<strong> TRUE YOGA COLLECTIVE blog</strong></p><p>“Yoga connects is not just a festival it’s a community where the vibration of love is strong. The festival was perfect, the vibe around the festival was super chilled but the schedule was packed out, so lots of incredible classes to choose from. There is something for everyone, from Voga to yoga on paddleboards to vinyasa flow classes. You have created something really special and I’m so excited about next year!!!” <strong>Vanessa Sadaghna</strong></p><p>“The Yoga Connects Festival, wow what an amazing experience... Attending the festival as a new yogi I was bowled over by the vibe, I thought it was going to be full of yummy mummy's on a weekend break. Instead I was met with a whole mixture of different people, different backgrounds all connected by the common denominator of Love, the Love vibe was everywhere, whether it became the focus in your practice, people openly wanting to make a difference to their surroundings, through the daily meditations held or just chatting to people and feeling their vibes. Then there was the music a great mix of live bands and even a yoga rave.. If you wanted to chill, you could, it was a beautiful summer’s weekend the sun was shining, people not in classes just hanging out and chatting or if you wanted more serious relaxation a fully operational spa.. I mean what more could you want, Yoga was clearly the main offering but the festival had so much more to offer I can’t wait to attend next years!!!” <strong>Clair Carter </strong></p><p>""Yoga Connects Festival is more than a one-off event, it’s a burgeoning community featuring some of the most inspiring and interesting yogis in the world. They are a bright light in the industry, maintaining yogic principals both on and off the mat! Despite hundreds of people being there- there was virtually no plastic and scarce waste - I only saw one bin that was actually full! Can’t wait til next years- please support this growing family and join in on the fun."" <strong>Jessica Long</strong></p><p>“Yoga connects literally does exactly what it says on the Tin ! It is a brilliantly scheduled yoga festival in the UK that connects a whole group of likeminded people together under one big family roof. The vibe here was off the hook this year with people buzzing around doing yoga, making friends and a whole lot more. There is nothing not to love about this festival it literally has something for everyone and it not to be missed !” <strong>Charlotte Wellfare</strong></p><p>“Yoga, global connection around the bonfire, ceremony, camping underneath the stars, conscious talks, soaking in hot tubs, lakes and watching people full of joy and laughter whilst underneath the open sky.

The event attracted 400 people from around the globe. Sensationally, it has been voted one of the Top 20 Yoga festivals around the world by Cody App. Cody app is the most successful Yoga App based in the US selling online yoga classes around the world.Including in the weekend ticket (3-day pass) an unlimited selection of yoga classes, a variety of activities, live music, a Shamanic opening ceremony, a Yoga Rave, dance classes, Gong baths with excellent Yoga Teachers from around the world. We created an experience for everyone to connect, exchange, network, practice yoga and above all have relax and have fun.The line up included big name yoga teachers, Meghan Currie from Canada, YogaBeyond from Australia, Dylan Werner and Patrick Beach from the US and Celest Pereira from the UK amongst other UK based teachers, musicians, performers and speakers. Yoga Connects - we aim to make the world a better place by creating a platform for connection. Our vision is collaboration and shared vibration.TESTIMONIALS:“Everyone was more than happy mingling with people they’d never met, chilling out with them in the sunshine on the grass, sharing food and/or a smoothie from one of the stands, or some yoga tips to help improve certain postures. Yoga does indeed connect, and that’s exactly what this festival was doing”. The festival was true success in my opinion. It brought together people from all over the world and allowed them to connect through a shared love of yoga, and the number of people there was Goldilocks for me – just the right amount. Whilst I have no doubt this event will grow to be even bigger and better in the years to come, I’m glad I went to this first one as, whilst it was grand, it still felt intimate. Dare to Move Blog“Yoga Connects Festival is perfectly named for the atmosphere it managed to create. Everywhere you looked, people were exploring what yoga and connection meant to them. Rarely have I had the pleasure of being in the presence of so many soulful, loving, compassionate, generous and open hearted people. The festival was pure magic, fuelled by love and passion for yoga and connection that it facilitates” TRUE YOGA COLLECTIVE blog“Yoga connects is not just a festival it’s a community where the vibration of love is strong. The festival was perfect, the vibe around the festival was super chilled but the schedule was packed out, so lots of incredible classes to choose from. There is something for everyone, from Voga to yoga on paddleboards to vinyasa flow classes. You have created something really special and I’m so excited about next year!!!” Vanessa Sadaghna“The Yoga Connects Festival, wow what an amazing experience... Attending the festival as a new yogi I was bowled over by the vibe, I thought it was going to be full of yummy mummy's on a weekend break. Instead I was met with a whole mixture of different people, different backgrounds all connected by the common denominator of Love, the Love vibe was everywhere, whether it became the focus in your practice, people openly wanting to make a difference to their surroundings, through the daily meditations held or just chatting to people and feeling their vibes. Then there was the music a great mix of live bands and even a yoga rave.. If you wanted to chill, you could, it was a beautiful summer’s weekend the sun was shining, people not in classes just hanging out and chatting or if you wanted more serious relaxation a fully operational spa.. I mean what more could you want, Yoga was clearly the main offering but the festival had so much more to offer I can’t wait to attend next years!!!” Clair Carter ""Yoga Connects Festival is more than a one-off event, it’s a burgeoning community featuring some of the most inspiring and interesting yogis in the world. They are a bright light in the industry, maintaining yogic principals both on and off the mat! Despite hundreds of people being there- there was virtually no plastic and scarce waste - I only saw one bin that was actually full! Can’t wait til next years- please support this growing family and join in on the fun."" Jessica Long“Yoga connects literally does exactly what it says on the Tin ! It is a brilliantly scheduled yoga festival in the UK that connects a whole group of likeminded people together under one big family roof. The vibe here was off the hook this year with people buzzing around doing yoga, making friends and a whole lot more. There is nothing not to love about this festival it literally has something for everyone and it not to be missed !” Charlotte Wellfare“Yoga, global connection around the bonfire, ceremony, camping underneath the stars, conscious talks, soaking in hot tubs, lakes and watching people full of joy and laughter whilst underneath the open sky. From dream to reality YOGA CONNECTS FESTIVAL is truly magical!”  Marc Laws II""SurfSUPyoga were honoured to be a part of the 2015 Yoga Connects Festival. We had an absolute blast running SUP & SUPyoga sessions at such a stunning venue, with the most perfect lake and conditions for beginners & taster sessions. The vibe was amazing, we were blessed with beautiful weather and everyone was really keen to get OmBoard to practise their asana in a class or people were able to just hire boards and paddle in total safety while chillaxing in the most serene surroundings. The organisation and smooth running of the entire festival was second to none. Really looking forward to Yoga Connects 2016 where we will have a floating dock with SUPfit session to add to the schedule"" Nichola Cummiskey,  Founder of surfsupfityoga.com",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Its very difficult for a small business to get off the ground without seed funding, but fortunately for Secretly Obvious, our products are so effective that we have been making it without these resources since March of 2015! We would like to expand our business to a wider audience and be able to offer affordable natural holistic products to the public in stores, farmers markets, and be even more accessible world wide. Currently we have to wait for orders in order to get inventory, which makes our shipping and wait times longer than necessary! Any amount of money we gain from this campaign will be used to purchase more inventory so we can sell our products in stores and Farmer's Markets.</p>

<p>Our hope for Secretly Obvious is that we can expand our product line  to include even more natural products to suit a wide variety of skin types and concerns.

<p>Modern pharmacology is essentially the process of taking the active ingredients out of plants and putting them a pill, lotion, powder, or other form, along with fillers and carrier or neutral substrates. By completely bypassing that process, and using pure herbs or plant extract, essential oil and herbal users have more success and less cost. These products work because they are pure, all natural, potent, and are created using ancient wisdom that has proven effective since the dawn of time. We are all over saturated in a sea of products that either aren't good for us, or simply don't work to restore health or prevent illness. We are being ripped off in every store by nearly every product available for purchase, because they are all made in a chemical plant funded by corporate greed and agenda. The results simply aren't adding up for any of us, and we could all use the opportunity to invest in our own future and our own health. </p>

<p>Though holistic and alternative medicine has a somewhat controversial history, we are now equipped as a society with the scientific understanding that there is nothing better for human beings than plants. Those who are believers in essential oils and herbs, understand that they have been used as the oldest form of medicine in the world. There is nothing new about nature. </p>
<p>Essential oils are for every body capable of taking responsibility for their own health. Nature provides us with everything we need to be happy and healthy, but most stores and market places offer toxic materials that either don't work at all, or require continual purchase. Many of these products aren't good for us, and billions of dollars go into selling them to us. We are plagued with products that offer anything but a natural solution, and being that the FDA regulations are sold to the highest bidder, the ingredients on the phrasing and ingredients on labels don't even have to be truthful in the United States. <br/></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><b>User mistakes</b></p>
<p>Essential oils don't let us lie to ourselves. They dramatically effect the human system, and these effects are usually positive. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">At the end of the day, using these products correctly and following the recommendations and instructions, will yield positive results in more ways than one. Misusing the products does NOT include burns, scars, bleaching, or other toxic damage that is associated with other skincare. Ours is safe to experiment with to a certain extent, the only challenge is patience from users! </span></p>
<p><b>User Patience and Honesty</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If a user is allergic to plants such as flowers, trees, grasses, vegetables, or fruits, I can always create a custom formula for anyone concerned, but they must tell me! My exact formulation of ingredients is a secret but anyone with a specific allergy should know that I include a spectrum of plant oils and nothing else. If you are unsure about allergies, just get a blood panel done, you may find out more information about the causes of your skin condition this way and it can help us naturally eliminate it. </span><br/></p>
<p><b>Logistics and Red Tape</b></p>
<p>Challenges include the waiting game, searching and finding what we need for expansion, legal patenting and insuring, and other expected  logistics of ""Red Tape"". </p>

Essential oils don't let us lie to ourselves. They dramatically effect the human system, and these effects are usually positive. At the end of the day, using these products correctly and following the recommendations and instructions, will yield positive results in more ways than one. Misusing the products does NOT include burns, scars, bleaching, or other toxic damage that is associated with other skincare. Ours is safe to experiment with to a certain extent, the only challenge is patience from users! 
User Patience and Honesty
If a user is allergic to plants such as flowers, trees, grasses, vegetables, or fruits, I can always create a custom formula for anyone concerned, but they must tell me! My exact formulation of ingredients is a secret but anyone with a specific allergy should know that I include a spectrum of plant oils and nothing else. If you are unsure about allergies, just get a blood panel done, you may find out more information about the causes of your skin condition this way and it can help us naturally eliminate it. 
Logistics and Red Tape
Challenges include the waiting game, searching and finding what we need for expansion, legal patenting and insuring, and other expected  logistics of ""Red Tape"". 
Our products sell themselves, they truly work, and the only challenge is spreading the word to responsible people who believe in the power of Nature!

What is Hepatitis B?



Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) which affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellow skin, feeling tired, dark urine and abdominal pain.


Is there a cure for hepatitis B?


If there is less hepatitis B virus being produced, then there is less damage being done to the liver. Sometimes these drugs can even get rid of the virus. With all of the new exciting research, there is great hope that a complete cure will be found for chronic hepatitis B in the near future.

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">CHECK YOUR BALANCE</h1>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">RIGHT NOW.</h1>
<p>Stand <b>flat</b> on one foot. How's your balance? Good? Mediocre? Poor? Now, stand on the <b>ball &amp; toes</b>
 of that foot. How's your balance now? Probably severely compromised 
with noticeable amounts of twitching &amp; excessive motion taking place
 at your toes, foot &amp; ankle, not to mention swinging hips, erratic 
tilting of your upper body &amp; flailing arms (a bit like a bird flying
 in a wind storm). <br/><br/>Clearly, you can feel that just because you 
may be able to balance yourself fairly well when standing on one leg 
with a flat foot, doesn't automatically mean that you can do the same 
when standing on the ball &amp; toes of that foot. The disparity between
 these 2 types of balance is important because the first relates to 
static/minimal movement situations, while the latter form of balance, on the ball &amp; 
toes, illuminates existing deficiencies directly related to moving dynamically from 
one point to another, which can potentially lead to serious short &amp; 
long term problems.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">PROBLEM?</h1>
<p>What most active &amp; inactive people who suffer from knee, hip 
&amp; back pain, as well as frequent ankle sprains fail to realize is 
that the <b>low strength &amp; stabilization capacity of the foot &amp; ankle complex</b>, created by years of reinforced flat foot positioning during exercise or during ground contact in motion, leads to:</p>
<li>compromised ankle integrity &amp; mobility</li>
<li>inhibited lower body shock absorbency in walking, running, &amp; 
landing from jumping which stresses the joints (ankle, knee, hip &amp; 
back), bones (upper/lower leg &amp; heel) &amp; prematurely wears down 
the cartilage between the bones</li>
<li>under-stimulated core muscles (abdominals, obliques, mid/lower back 
&amp; glutes) which are supposed to protect the spine, yield good 
posture &amp; facilitate leverage for producing power through the 
extremities</li>
<li>subpar movement mechanics, balance in motion, stabilization &amp; overall body control, even in the extremely fit</li>

<h1>
DISRUPTING THE STATUS QUO OF CONVENTIONAL WISDOM</h1>
<p>A widely accepted practice among fitness &amp; sports medicine professionals is instructing people to <i>push from the heel of the foot</i> while performing ""<b>functional exercises</b>"" selected for strengthening &amp; toning the <b>lower body</b>,
 as well as to improve daily activities like climbing &amp; descending 
stairs, walking, running &amp; jumping. Notice the 'heel down' position,
 indicated by red arrows, in the following examples of the 3 most common
 exercises used for this purpose:  <br/></p>
<p><b>SQUATS</b></p>
<div><b></b></div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455774435/d8yqvc8vlvlhuhvvaheb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>LUNGES</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455774500/wjpqemsducud4thfdhhb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b>STEP UPS</b>
</div>
<div>
<b></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455775204/dyky6axryzh41wdalw56.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>However, close observation of lower body driven motion that carries the body from point to point clearly reveals that the contact area of the foot during ground force production (the push off &amp; acceleration), as well as ground force absorption (the landing &amp; deceleration), actually occurs at the <i>ball of the foot &amp; toes</i>...<strong>not</strong> the heel.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In the words of a certain ‘<i>shark in the tank</i>’ I hope to one day meet,  <b>STOP THE MADNESS!</b>  Functional exercises are supposed to mimic &amp; enhance real life function, yet the popular <i>heel drive emphasis in lower body strength exercises </i>practiced for decades does <b>not</b> accurately 
translate into real life function.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In
 fact, any constant reinforcement of neuromuscular pathways set by 
repeated movement patterns, that do not translate effectively into daily 
life, as is the case with the HEEL DOWN drive, 
actually perpetuates a disconnect of the stabilizing muscles 
which are necessary for translating power &amp; strength during ground 
force production &amp; absorption. As a consequence, these critical muscles remain underdeveloped &amp; lack the capacity to sufficiently safeguard the body from the risks of common avoidable injuries sustained when moving from point to point.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Just
 because exercise science predetermines what many in the industry 
subscribe to when it comes to exercise prescription, doesn’t mean that 
we shouldn’t, from time to time, in any industry revisit the question of 
our intentions. What are we trying to achieve? Merely moving heavier 
weight? Or facilitating optimal performance with an adherence to injury 
prevention? But don't take my word for it. See for yourself. Does real 
life propulsion happen at the <b>Heel</b> they way people are taught to do conventional Squats, Lunges or Step Ups, or at the <b>Ball of the Foot &amp; Toes</b>? Which do YOU see in the following real life examples?</div>

<br/>If you answered <b>THE BALL OF THE FOOT &amp; TOES </b>to all the above examples shown then you're eyes are working just fine!

PUSH FROM THE HEEL during maximum force production. Sadly, this didn't end well for him. This player suffered a ruptured Achilles Tendon, had to get emergency surgery, endured unfathomable pain &amp; spent a full season &amp; off-season  recovering from his injury.</div><div><br/></div><div>Tragic errors like these can be avoided or at least dramatically minimized with a more thorough &amp; deliberate unconventional approach to preparation process.

</div><div>Make no mistake about it, <b>STUMPIN</b>'™ encompasses exercise science, but not at the expense of common sense. Using the STUMPS on a regular basis not only strengthens the stabilizing muscles of the foot &amp; ankle complex for better balance, an all important physical attribute for seniors, but it increases the muscular endurance in that area enabling the body to maintain a more rigid spring structure. This stronger more resilient spring not only minimizes the risk of injury, but dramatically improves one's ability to generate the force needed to move quicker, to be more explosive, while simultaneously acting as a buffer against shock to the ankles, knees, hips &amp; back. GET STUMPIN'!</div><div>

<br/>
</div>""Slick"", ""high-tech"" design &amp; 'extra-terrestrial' are the words most frequently used to describe them at first sight. A closer look at the patent-pending <b>STUMPS</b>™, however, reveals design features that are not only visually compelling, but strategic in their function; further distinguishing them from any sports &amp; fitness training product in existence.</div><div>

Anyone can workout on a product &amp; get something good out of it, but training on these high performance platforms keeps you accountable to precise hand &amp; foot placements, which by default, keeps mental focus &amp; body control at the forefront of your <b>STUMPIN</b>'™ workout experience. As discussed earlier the diameter of the A-STUMP is designed to accommodate the Ball of the Foot &amp; Toes &amp; for the purpose of progression, wider STUMPS are favorable when the user needs a little room for error. But across all sub-sections the 5½ inch diameter is the repeated focal point that keeps accountability to precision constant. </p></div><div>

<p>The patent-pending <b>STUMPS</b>™ prototypes have endured almost 3 years of 'real world' applications, including rigorous field-testing by top Fitness &amp; Sports Medicine Professionals including those in Sports Medicine (a tough audience to please) as well as Athletes, Youth &amp; Seniors. After passing all tests with flying colors, &amp; removing any doubt about how it will be received in real world applications, the time has come to move this product into the next exciting stage. <i>The first production run, which will make STUMPIN' accessible worldwide!</i></p>
<p>PERFORMANCE MINDED must raise $60K which will be used to implement final design modifications which, after extensive participant testing, were deemed necessary to enhance the total STUMPIN'™ experience, from form to function. </p>
<p>We got tremendous positive feedback from all of our participants, yet as a young company we will stop at nothing to ensure that the workmanship of the product &amp; the integrity of the training method meet the highest standards that we set for ourselves. A standard that we respect &amp; know is expected from the esteemed professionals who have endorsed the STUMPS &amp; the many others out there like you, who have yet to GetStumpin' firsthand.</p>
<p>With a key investors lined up for the actual manufacturing, marketing, operating expenses of this start up, raising this $60K will allow PERFORMANCE MINDED to advance to the next critical step towards production AND, to retain sufficient equity which will be used strategically to attract &amp; build an incentivized Team of dedicated professionals (some of whom are already being scouted).

<p><b>TO OUR FUTURE SUPPORTERS</b>                                                                                         </p>
<p>You've seen the product in action! What you may not know is that these patent-pending prototype <b>STUMPS</b>™ were made possible largely from a previous campaign hosted right here on INDIEGOGO back in 2013. At that time, people trusted me with their contributions without even seeing so much as a sketch of the product. Those supporters took my word &amp; I took that confidence &amp; their generosity, multiplied it with prayer, blood &amp; good ol' fashioned sweat! </p>
<p>I'm here today showcasing what was once a burning vision in my mind that I could barely contain. It's real now because people believed in me when I had nothing but my word to give them. Today, I have my word, my track record of doing what exactly I said I would do, these cool STUMPS &amp; droves of people who now have their own stories &amp; experiences with the STUMPS. People who use the prototypes regularly with me, &amp; have already written checks to Pre-Order their own sets! Imagine what I'll do this time around. </p>
<p>STUMPIN'™ is a lit fuse &amp; your help will keep it burning. You can <b>Pre-Order</b> your <b>STUMPS</b>™ in any of the following 3 ways:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>FULL SET</b> - 4 Platforms, each consisting of 3 sub-sections, <b>12 Platforms total</b>; A, B &amp; C times 4. This allows you to take full advantage of the total STUMPIN' experience from Beginner to the most Elite Competitive Athlete</li>
<li>
<b>THE A &amp; B SET</b> - 4 Platforms, each consisting of 2 sub-sections/top &amp; middle, <b>8 Platforms total</b>; A &amp; B times 4. The absence of the C-STUMPS™ (the largest bottom sub-section) in this option will limit the elevation choices of a FULL SET, but you'll be more than capable of experiencing a multitude of applications going this route.</li>
<li>
<b>THE As</b> - These 4 Individual Platforms are the apex of the STUMPS™. From a balance challenge &amp; development standpoint, no part of the STUMP™ are more demanding than THE As. Within the STUMPIN' PROTOCOLS (education, programming &amp; certification), which will be discussed in future video posts &amp; updated content here on the campaign, THE As are the sub-sections of choice for applications under the banner of '<b>STUMPIN' TO GO</b>'. The compact size of THE As makes them portable enough to take on the road, so that you'll never have to go without your daily dose of movement meditation &amp; keeping your balance &amp; mental focus sharp. They're deceptively versatile enough to ensure that you'll get a full workout from the bottom to the top wherever you may go! THE As will keep you honest in your training. Don't let their size fool you.</li>

GETSTUMPIN'.

Conceived by Kappel LeRoy Clarke, a 27-year Sports & Fitness Training veteran, creator of FRE FLO DO, & 2-time World Record Setter & Holder of his 2.7 mile Pier 2 Pier Kettlebell Challenge (2010 & 2013 see YouTube 'A Marathon of Power'), STUMPS™ & The Dynamic Precision System aka STUMPIN'™ combine to get you Fit, Focused & Proficient in moving with Heightened Independent Body Control.


MAKE ANY SPACE
YOUR STUMPIN' GROUND
STUMPS™ are durable 3-in-1 high performance platforms with varied bases of support & bold signature markings that transform any indoor or outdoor space into a fun, challenging & mindful workout environment.
These versatile training tools come 4 per set & can accommodate a wide range of users & applications, including:





ENGAGE  EXPOSE  ENHANCE™


The Dynamic Precision System aka STUMPIN'™ is an integration of bodyweight conditioning, movement refinement & sensory response enhancement that uses STUMPS™ to introduce a new dimension to assessing, developing & enhancing:


Mental Focus
Core & Total Body Strength
Injury Preventative Movement Mechanics
Balance & Stabilization
Footwork
Quickness
Stamina
Spatial Awareness





CHECK YOUR BALANCE
RIGHT NOW.
Stand flat on one foot. How's your balance? Good? Mediocre? Poor? Now, stand on the ball & toes
 of that foot. How's your balance now? Probably severely compromised 
with noticeable amounts of twitching & excessive motion taking place
 at your toes, foot & ankle, not to mention swinging hips, erratic 
tilting of your upper body & flailing arms (a bit like a bird flying
 in a wind storm). Clearly, you can feel that just because you 
may be able to balance yourself fairly well when standing on one leg 
with a flat foot, doesn't automatically mean that you can do the same 
when standing on the ball & toes of that foot. The disparity between
 these 2 types of balance is important because the first relates to 
static/minimal movement situations, while the latter form of balance, on the ball & 
toes, illuminates existing deficiencies directly related to moving dynamically from 
one point to another, which can potentially lead to serious short & 
long term problems.





PROBLEM?
What most active & inactive people who suffer from knee, hip 
& back pain, as well as frequent ankle sprains fail to realize is 
that the low strength & stabilization capacity of the foot & ankle complex, created by years of reinforced flat foot positioning during exercise or during ground contact in motion, leads to:
compromised ankle integrity & mobility
inhibited lower body shock absorbency in walking, running, & 
landing from jumping which stresses the joints (ankle, knee, hip & 
back), bones (upper/lower leg & heel) & prematurely wears down 
the cartilage between the bones
under-stimulated core muscles (abdominals, obliques, mid/lower back 
& glutes) which are supposed to protect the spine, yield good 
posture & facilitate leverage for producing power through the 
extremities
subpar movement mechanics, balance in motion, stabilization & overall body control, even in the extremely fit




A CREDIBLE SOLUTION!
STUMPS™ &The Dynamic Precision System™ aka STUMPIN'™, a product of revolutionary design & a training method for game changing results, combine to: 


make any indoor or outdoor space a dynamic workout environment facilitating exercises that target & strengthen those weak & commonly overlooked areas key to independent body control


correct & improve movement mechanics for daily function, while optimizing fitness levels, athletic performance & injury prevention

introduce hundreds of fun, comprehensive & user-friendly bodyweight based workouts that can be done in as little as 15 minutes a day or dialed up as needed 


ENGAGE EXPOSE ENHANCE™ any level of user mentally & physically
 from Kids to seniors, Fitness Enthusiasts to Professional Athletes, or 
those returning from injury setbacks under the care of Sports Medicine Specialists
 via unique applications that demand presence of mind & improve 
concentration & proprioception (spatial awareness)

DISRUPTING THE STATUS QUO OF CONVENTIONAL WISDOM
A widely accepted practice among fitness & sports medicine professionals is instructing people to push from the heel of the foot while performing ""functional exercises"" selected for strengthening & toning the lower body,
 as well as to improve daily activities like climbing & descending 
stairs, walking, running & jumping. Notice the 'heel down' position,
 indicated by red arrows, in the following examples of the 3 most common
 exercises used for this purpose:  
SQUATS





LUNGES


STEP UPS


However, close observation of lower body driven motion that carries the body from point to point clearly reveals that the contact area of the foot during ground force production (the push off & acceleration), as well as ground force absorption (the landing & deceleration), actually occurs at the ball of the foot & toes...not the heel.


In the words of a certain ‘shark in the tank’ I hope to one day meet,  STOP THE MADNESS!  Functional exercises are supposed to mimic & enhance real life function, yet the popular heel drive emphasis in lower body strength exercises practiced for decades does not accurately 
translate into real life function.

In
 fact, any constant reinforcement of neuromuscular pathways set by 
repeated movement patterns, that do not translate effectively into daily 
life, as is the case with the HEEL DOWN drive, 
actually perpetuates a disconnect of the stabilizing muscles 
which are necessary for translating power & strength during ground 
force production & absorption. As a consequence, these critical muscles remain underdeveloped & lack the capacity to sufficiently safeguard the body from the risks of common avoidable injuries sustained when moving from point to point.


Just
 because exercise science predetermines what many in the industry 
subscribe to when it comes to exercise prescription, doesn’t mean that 
we shouldn’t, from time to time, in any industry revisit the question of 
our intentions. What are we trying to achieve? Merely moving heavier 
weight? Or facilitating optimal performance with an adherence to injury 
prevention? But don't take my word for it. See for yourself. Does real 
life propulsion happen at the Heel they way people are taught to do conventional Squats, Lunges or Step Ups, or at the Ball of the Foot & Toes? Which do YOU see in the following real life examples?


WALKING:
HEEL OR BALL OF THE FOOT & TOES?


A SPRINTER EXPLODING OUT OF THE STARTING BLOCKS:
HEEL OR BALL OF THE FOOT & TOES?



A SPRINTER IN TRANSITION TO TOP SPEED:
HEEL OR BALL OF THE FOOT & TOES?


WHAT PART OF THE FOOT ARE STARTING BLOCKS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT & WHAT OF PART OF THE FOOT DO THE ONLY SPIKES IN A SPRINTER'S TRACK SHOE APPEAR BENEATH:
HEEL OR BALL OF THE FOOT & TOES?



FOOTBALL LINEMEN READY TO POUNCE:
HEEL OR BALL OF THE FOOT & TOES?





A TENNIS PLAYER SERVING, RETURNING SERVE OR ATTACKING:
HEEL OR BALL OF THE FOOT & TOES?



A BASKETBALL PLAYER CUTTING DIRECTION:
HEEL OR BALL OF THE FOOT & TOES?




A BASKETBALL PLAYER JUMPING FOR THE SLAM:
HEEL OR BALL OF THE FOOT & TOES?



FIRST POINT OF GROUND CONTACT/BASKETBALL PLAYER LANDING:
HEEL OR BALL OF THE FOOT & TOES?


A CYCLIST PUSHING DOWN THE PEDAL:
HEEL OR BALL OF THE FOOT & TOES?



THE EXPLOSIVE PHASE OF AN OLYMPIC CLEAN:
HEEL OR BALL OF THE FOOT & TOES?



THE AREA OF THE FOOT WHICH THE A-STUMP & THE CENTERS OF THE B & C-STUMPS WERE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT & LAY TARGET FOR:
HEEL OR BALL OF THE FOOT & TOES?




If you answered THE BALL OF THE FOOT & TOES to all the above examples shown then you're eyes are working just fine! But more importantly, you've seen for yourself why HEEL DOWN/HEEL PUSH conventional wisdom, in this case,  falls short of the mark in fully preparing the body for the demands of moving from point to point in daily life & high level competition.***This photo below illustrates one tragic consequence suffered by a professional basketball player whose body did exactly what it was trained to do. PUSH FROM THE HEEL during maximum force production. Sadly, this didn't end well for him. This player suffered a ruptured Achilles Tendon, had to get emergency surgery, endured unfathomable pain & spent a full season & off-season  recovering from his injury.Tragic errors like these can be avoided or at least dramatically minimized with a more thorough & deliberate unconventional approach to preparation process. A process governed by intention versus popular widely accepted practices that go unchecked.


Make no mistake about it, STUMPIN'™ encompasses exercise science, but not at the expense of common sense. Using the STUMPS on a regular basis not only strengthens the stabilizing muscles of the foot & ankle complex for better balance, an all important physical attribute for seniors, but it increases the muscular endurance in that area enabling the body to maintain a more rigid spring structure. This stronger more resilient spring not only minimizes the risk of injury, but dramatically improves one's ability to generate the force needed to move quicker, to be more explosive, while simultaneously acting as a buffer against shock to the ankles, knees, hips & back. GET STUMPIN'!




A REVOLUTION IN DESIGN

""Slick"", ""high-tech"" design & 'extra-terrestrial' are the words most frequently used to describe them at first sight. A closer look at the patent-pending STUMPS™, however, reveals design features that are not only visually compelling, but strategic in their function; further distinguishing them from any sports & fitness training product in existence.
STUMPS™ 3-in-1 design means each FULL STUMP is compromised of 3 sub-STUMP sections. A top, B middle & C bottom.




TARGET TOPS™  are 1 of the 3 strategic signature markings of the STUMPS™. Anyone can workout on a product & get something good out of it, but training on these high performance platforms keeps you accountable to precise hand & foot placements, which by default, keeps mental focus & body control at the forefront of your STUMPIN'™ workout experience. As discussed earlier the diameter of the A-STUMP is designed to accommodate the Ball of the Foot & Toes & for the purpose of progression, wider STUMPS are favorable when the user needs a little room for error. But across all sub-sections the 5½ inch diameter is the repeated focal point that keeps accountability to precision constant. 



WAFFLE BOTTOMS  Bring an engineer's sensibility into the durability of the STUMPS™. Each sub-section is designed to withstand a 1,000lb load which makes it well suited for the most dynamic applications. Dynamic. Imagine that.


BASE LEVEL LINES  Are 2 of 3 signature markings that make it very easy to spot the your STUMPS™ & detect how high or low your next hand or foot placement needs to be. A very helpful feature once your STUMPIN'™ skills progress to a quicker movement tempo & spatial awareness becomes more intuitive.



THE NUMERICAL DOTS the third signature marking was conceptualized for universal recognition when performing drills that have the user navigate to & from assigned STUMPS™. Since they are identical in shape & size, they need to be distinguishable for users around the world. One tree, one fruit, one dot is still one in any part of the globe regardless of language. It's that simple.






CONFIGURABLE Each of your STUMPS™ can be configured in the following 4 ways. There are hundreds of workouts that can be done & infinite ways in which you can be the architect of your own STUMPIN'™ GROUND.


STACKABLE Storing your STUMPS™ is simple & takes no more floor space than the footprint of an 65cm inflatable exercise ball.



NIGHT VISION Technically, it's not a signature marking, but an effect of the signature markings. Flip the lights & enjoy an unparalleled workout experience that stimulates the senses with its unique, luminescent, glow  in the dark Signature Markings. (Night Vision is a feature of the patent-pending STUMPS™ but has not yet been confirmed as available for the first production run)

<p>ACRT is a behavioural therapy for developing control of seizures. Through interactive online sessions, a participant will develop a specific set of skills to prevent and stop seizures. Once a participant obtain these skills, the effect can last for many years. ACRT is a non-invasive, side-effect free, effective and affordable therapy. </p>
<p>ACRT consists of 12 sessions, each session lasting about 45 minutes. To achieve the best effect, we recommend allocating three sessions a week (e.g. Monday, Wednesday and Friday) over a 4-week period.</p>
<p>During each session, you will also receive instructions and practice the technique, which you will then be able to start applying in your daily life.</p>

How does ACRT work?
</h2>
</div>
<p>The therapy embodies both physiological and psychological approaches. Our thoughts and emotions are closely linked to our bodily responses and behaviour. Events in our daily lives trigger thoughts that in turn give rise to emotions that change both our bodily stress responses and our behaviour.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446129965/snrfw6esykubhzgvgvtj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Psychological treatments, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), argue that psychological distress is caused by distorted thoughts (or thinking habit) that trigger negative emotions and unhelpful behaviours. CBT helps you identify these distorted thoughts and correct them so that you can have more realistic and balanced way of thinking.</p>
<p>ACRT extends this CBT model by also
taking a more holistic account of the role of the body in the expression of emotional
feelings and thoughts, and by working directly on physiological aspects of well-being.</p>
<p>Published research shows that more
than 80% of people with epilepsy consider stress and anxiety to be a major factor in causing seizures. It is therefore very important to understand the mechanisms
of how the mind, brain and body interact.
Drug treatments on their own cannot give this understanding</p>
<p>Using ACRT, you will see how your body responds to your thinking and emotion. By receiving visual feedback about how your body reacts, you will be able to train yourself to become more sensitive to your bodily reactions and control your body’s state of alertness. Through this process, you will also learn how to stabilize your emotion.</p>

Who will benefit?
</h2>
</div>
<p>People with epilepsy who experience brief
auras are particularly good candidates for this type of therapy. However this is
by no means a requirement for a successful outcome. There are people without
any aura who reduce seizures by more than two thirds or more of seizures after a month of therapy.
A modified set of instructions is given in the platform for those people who do
not have an aura. People whose seizures occur predominantly with stress,
anxiety and low mood are also good candidates. Unfortunately, clinical
experience suggests that ACRT in its present form does not work as well for people who have a significant learning disability. </p>

<p>Dr Yoko Nagai began her research in electrodermal biofeedback therapy for epilepsy in 1997. This research has since attracted scientific research funding of over £300,000 that has enabled clinical trials and a deeper understanding of the brain mechanisms by which the therapy can reduce the occurrence of epileptic seizures. Dr Nagai also founded the Biofeedback Clinic in 2005, in response to demand from patients at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London.</p>
<p>At the clinic, she treated people with epilepsy on a private basis, enabling her to continue to pursue her university research activity. There are many advantages to face-to-face therapy, but only a few people can be treated at a time, and this can be frustrating for the majority of people who wish to access the therapy in this form. Dr Nagai is now seeking to share her expertise and treatment with people globally who are in need for this effective non-drug therapy, which is termed Autonomic Cognitive Rehabituation Training (ACRT).</p>

<p>Dr Nagai's research started with investigations
into how brain and peripheral body reactions are related each other. We think that when our brain gets excited, our body does too, but it is not always the case. </p>
<p>Dr Nagai measures and observes a body
signal called electrodermal activity (EDA)/Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) which
is very sensitive to our thoughts and emotions. You may know already that EDA
is used in lie detector tests. Dr Nagai’s research has extensively
investigated how changes in EDA also modulate different brain signals.  To this end Dr Nagai has applied tools
including electroencephalography (EEG) and functional MRI (fMRI). For people
who would like to know more, the ACRT platform will have ""a science

The functional activity of distinct brain
regions changes over the course of the therapy. Our research shows that one
month of ACRT training increases resilience of people to anxiety-related
seizure attacks. 

Dr Nagai is currently investigating further
neural mechanisms through which ACRT helps seizure control. This
project is funded by a UK major research charitable body, the Wellcome Trust.

Our practitioners...
Have lots of experience, passion, dedication and professionalism. Click to see us on Facebook.
We have served patients of a busy doctor's office in Falmouth, Maine for the past 3 years, relieving pain and anxiety on the spot. We have recently expanded to serve people in recovery from addiction, as well as rescued animals at a local shelter.

We are especially hopeful for the addiction recovery work, as this has become a crisis in Maine and elsewhere, and programs that help are attracting broad community support.

A guest blog for Pamela Miles, world-famous Reiki Master, and a TV news story describe the clinic in the doctor's office.

We have defined our mission and values as a group, and agreed to move forward to build a cooperative ownership structure.

Our immediate need is to fund tuition to attend three workshops given by the Cooperative Design Lab over the next 9 months, the first one coming up fast on April 9 & 10.

These workshops are affordable and packed with details, given by professionals with track records in building cooperative ventures.

Ideally, we would send 2 people, for a total tuition of $1100, based on $550 per person for all three workshops.

This will position us to establish a strong business foundation for our cooperative, so that we can credibly and professionally bring the benefits of Reiki treatment to more who need it, and allow for future growth.
If we fall short of the full goal, we will either send one person or work with the workshop providers on a payment plan and fundraise again to support it, or use the InDemand feature to continue to receive donations after the 14-day period is over.We intend to do other fundraising activities including future crowdfunding, as we further define our needs and budgets, within the framework of business planning informed by the workshops you are helping to fund here.

All in an effort to make a short, inspirational documentary about the journey, and to raise awareness about mental health issues - this campaign is in support of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH).</p>
<p>I'm someone who lives with severe anxiety and depression. In early 2015, I was in a pretty dark place. The anxiety and depression had been slowly building up to a breaking point. It felt like I was floating through my days and got to a point where I only looked forward to going to sleep at night. I was waking up in the middle of the night with panic attacks, felt completely lethargic during the days, and felt like I didn't have any purpose. Days were spent just going through the motions.</p>
<p>Somewhere amid a worried Google search, I read that one of the things that can help ease anxiety and depression is exercise. So I started moving. Going for walks at first. Then short jogs. Training throughout the summer and fall, I went from finding it difficult to get out of bed in the morning to being able to complete long runs with ease - using exercise as a form of medication and meditation.</p>
<p>Through this campaign, I'm going to share my story, the stories of others across the country, and defeat a challenge that this time last year I would have never imagined possible.</p>
<p>Mental health is something we are all affected by - 1 in 5 Canadians will suffer from some form of mental illness in their lives. This campaign is all about recognizing that and building a strong community that is able to face difficult challenges. Together, we are all stronger. Change starts with a discussion, and that's what making this film and going on this journey is all about.</p>
<p>We want you to be a part of that change.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need From You</h3> <p>In order to document this journey and make the film, we're going to need your help.</p> <ul> <li>We need to raise <b>$8,500</b>

</ul>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Challenge</h3> <p> This campaign is all about taking on a big challenge and defeating it. I will be running a total of 211 kilometres. That's more than the distance between Ottawa and Montréal. It's just a little less than the distance between Vancouver and Seattle. And traveling between 10 different cities across the entire country, coast to coast, is just going to add to the difficulty.</p>
<p>It's going to be hard.</p>
<p>Apart from the physical demands, in order to make it happen, we to need to cover the cost of flights, gas, food, some video &amp; audio equipment, and training supplies.</p>
<p>That's why we need your help to make this campaign come to life.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign is all about taking things that can be devastating to someone's life (depression, anxiety, stress... to name a few) and turn them into something inspirational. For this campaign, we have a few main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread awareness about depression and anxiety</li>
<li>Inspire others to use exercise as a way to live with mental health issues</li>
<li>Raise money for the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), the leading research and treatment facility for this field</li>
<li>Make an inspirational film documenting the journey and telling stories of living with anxiety and depression</li>
</ul>

It was one of the most challenging and rewarding things I've ever done. This year, I plan to hike the remainder of the trail. I'll be hiking from Hamburg, PA to Mt. Katahdin in Maine, over 900 miles.

<p>The Optic Nerve is vital in our vision because it carries the images from your eyes to your brain.  Optic Neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve. The main cause of Optic Neuritis hasn’t been determined but some causes are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>A viral infection, including viral encephalitis, measles, rubella, chickenpox, herpes zoster, mumps, and mononucleosis</li>
<li>An autoimmune condition including lupus, sarcoidosis, Neuromyelitis Optica and Behcet’s diease</li>
<li>Cryptococcus, a fungal infection</li>
<li>Respiratory infections, including Mycoplasma pneumonia and common upper respiratory tract infections</li>
<li>When the immune system mistakenly targets the substance (myelin) covering your optic nerve, resulting in inflammation and damage to the myelin.</li>
<li>Multiple Sclerosis</li>
</ul>
<div>Having Optic Neuritis can make hiking difficult. Not only are you dealing with the elevation changes, weather, and mental challenge....but sometimes you're doing it with little to no sight. I'll never forget being 6000 feet up in the Smokies when an Ocular Migraine hit me. My vision closed in and I lost all of the sight in one eye. The timing could not have been worse because it had just started hailing. I stood on the side of the trail while hikers passed me and got pelted with hail for 25 minutes until my vision returned.

<p><strong>What is MOVR?</strong></p>
<p>MOVR's philosophy is about taking a systematic, personalized approach to exercise so that each individual can experience meaningful success at every level. We customize every workout based on the user’s input and feedback, ensuring that every single sweat meets their needs and supports their movement goals in life and at play.</p>
<p>People want to feel good in their own bodies and need the accountability and the mentorship of someone (or some<i>thing</i>) that knows how to get them there. But we’re all busy, gyms can be intimidating and personal trainers are expensive. With the creation of MOVR, we want to offer free technology that adapts to each user and enables any<i>body </i>with access to a phone or computer the ability to move, as they are, at any given moment. When it comes to physical fitness, our goal is not to reinvent the wheel; but to teach people how to drive their own experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>By offering an app that is constantly adapting and delivering customized workouts based on user input and feedback, we will have the ability to identify exciting new trends.  This app is built to help get people moving - regardless of age, sex, fitness level or personal circumstance. Our vision is to build a large dataset of health profiles so that we can apply machine learning techniques to tease out successful patterns and continue to inform the MOVR custom-generated workouts for each individual.</p>
<p>Combining this innovative concept with the individual expertise of each member of our team, we have the working parts to create something previously unseen in the app world. With MOVR, we’re using technology to bring personal fitness out of the dark ages and change the way the world views exercise.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We have surrounded ourselves with people who are experts in the fields of exercise science, app development, social media, branding, photography, and videography to ensure we do this right.</p>
<p>Your thoughtful input, feedback and financial contributions are the final piece of the puzzle. With your assistance, we know we can make this app a household name you'll be proud to tell your friends you helped get off the ground. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If contributing financially is out of your realm but this project seems interesting to you, we ask you share this with as many people as you can via email or on your social media accounts.  We want to make some noise and we need your help!</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Knowing that about 80%

What is Aqualone ?
Aqualone is a totally
autonomous watering control system, it works without any energy.
One ‘’home version’’ Aqualone controller is able to manage for example up to 250 X4 ltrs/hr drippers, or 20 X 50 ltrs/hr micro sprinklers, and Aqualone ‘’pro’’ is able to control any size of hydraulic valve!
Knowing that about 80%
of fresh water available on earth is used for to crops, the widespread use of
this system could contribute to solving the shortages facing our planet.
The price of Aqualone
is incredibly competitive for a system that performs very complex functions
naturally.

In a nutshell !
With Aqualone everything is done automatically and naturally taking into account the water level in the reservoir.  Watering starts when the level is low and stops when the level is high.  On hot days, the irrigation system will water, on cooler days Aqualone will reduce the watering without you needing to take any action.  Everything happens on its own!






There are multiple advantages : 


UP TO 50% WATER SAVING***See details on the website:  www.aqualone.net



A PERFECT IRRIGATION CONTROL SYSTEMStarts the irrigation depending on the plants’ needs.




PLUG AND PLAY SYSTEMInstallation is simple and
quick. 


LOW COSTThe price of Aqualone is incredibly competitivefor a system that performs very complex functions naturally.Lasting SAVINGS on PURCHASE, INSTALLATION, MAINTENANCE and WATER CONSUMPTION.


NO ENERGY, NO BATTERY
Absence of batteries and
electronic components 
make Aqualone a sustainable product.
AUTONOMOUS ZONING SYSTEM
Aqualone can definitely be
installed in any remote place, it just needs pressurized water.





How does it work ?

Aqualone fills all
these functions without any tuning or tedious programming.Aqualone does not
require any energy!  No battery, no
wiring, no electronics, no migraine inducing users manuals.

Aqualone includes a magnetic bistable pilot valve able to activate any
sort and size of hydraulic valves, using simple tubing/ a simple hose. 

The excess water
drained from the reference pot is collected at the bottom of the holding
chamber, forcing the magnetic float to rise and stop the watering cycle.
As the system’s water
evaporation rate is the same as that of the concerned soil, a new irrigation
cycle will only begin when the soil is in drying-out phase.

<p><b>Village Health Camp</b></p>
<p>Organizing
monthly visit by medical and surgical teams to conduct health camps in the
villages and follow up treatments. This will be in addition to providing
medical supplies for people with chronic conditions like Diabetes,
Hypertension, thyroid, etc.</p>
<p><b>Your contribution of $500
or more can help us organize one camp and serve an average of 200 villagers in
the earthquake affected villages of Nepal. We intend to revisit every village
once in 3 months in 3 clusters of villages totaling to 12 camps in a year. This
will cost us a total of $6000($2.5 per person)</b>      
                     
                   </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Comprehensive Child
Health </b></p>
<p>Conditions like anaemia,
malnutrition, developmental delays, stomach worms which creates discomfort and
long term impacts in children's growth and future are not only common but also
easily preventable. Identifying and treating these ailments can improve
health for the children as they develop into adults. </p>
<p><b>Your contribution of $25
per child can help us provide the following services to the children in the
most remote and hard to reach hilly conflict ridden areas of Arunachal Pradesh,
Assam, Nagaland and Manipur. </b></p>
<p>Screening,
medical records, deworming, nutrition supplements, Iron tablets, specialist
consultation like ophthalmology and dental will be provided as a part of the
comprehensive child health program. Awareness on menstrual hygiene, sexuality
and sexual health, communicable and non-communicable diseases, nutrition and
lifestyle will also be provided. We intend to reach out to 400 children at a total cost of
$10000.</p>
<p><b>AarogyaSeva Volunteer Clinic in Bangalore</b></p>
<p>We are lucky to have received a generous
donation of a 3500 sq.ft build room to set up a free clinic where our
volunteers can offer much needed consultations to the needy right in the heart
of Bangalore city. The building is now complete and ready to start serving
people. </p>
<p>Your contribution will help us raise $10000 to equip the space
with essential basic equipment required for day-to-day functioning of the
clinic. With this we hope to reach out to an average of <b>5000</b> <b>patients in a year.</b> </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>We have done about 115 surgeries, treated
more than 8000 people, 60 medical camps, 10 children's camp and art
workshops, helped with about 100 temporary shelters, distributed over
15000 sanitary hygiene kits, 200 boxes of medical and surgical supplies, 13000
tarpaulins to mention a few things. We have had over 75 volunteers
including plastic and pediatric surgeons, generalists and nurses helping us
out.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1&amp;v=r5UfnYS-Vd4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The work doesn't stop here</a>. We have a long
way to go and we intend to continue our activities. We wish to rebuild health
posts, sub posts in about 20 villages, equip them with basic instruments and
medicines for a year. We also hope to refurbish operating rooms in some
hospitals. Solar grid for 2 villages with the help of rotary, street light,
water tanks with motors and toilets in the colonies where we have set up
temporary shelters. We will have medical teams doing follow up and treatments
for about a year. We will also be hoping to take care of health needs of 10000
children in schools as a part of the comprehensive school health program.</p>
<p><b>You can help us serve 2500 villagers through the rural health
camps, reach out to 400 children in the remote villages of north east India and
provide free consultations to 5000 people in Bangalore.</b></p>
<p>We have so far benefited over 50000 people access quality
healthcare services through our volunteer network. Our teams of dedicated

</div></div>","AarogyaSeva: Promoting Healthcare Volunteerism!Toby's Story: I spent 4 weeks in India volunteering with AarogyaSeva before the devastating earthquake hit Nepal killing more than 10000 people and leaving several thousand homeless and wounded - both physically and emotionally. I spent 8 long weeks in earthquake-affected Nepal, right in the remote and mountainous yet beautiful and welcoming epicenter of the country. But 8 long weeks is not enough. Nepal continues to breathe in spasms. And the one way I can help is by improving awareness about volunteering and yes, raise funds for AarogyaSeva, the organization I worked for in Nepal.""The unprecedented Chennai rains have been devastating and we have redirected several of our resources there to strive to answer every call for help. Click here for more details. Be a RainbowBe a Rainbow #Stronger together T-shirts are your way of telling you care and want to support the relief efforts where ever you are.  These are made by a local business. Show your support in 4 easy steps.1. Select No Perk when you order. 2. Contribute $20 or more and own this t-shirt.3. Specify a size  (S, M, L, XL) and 4. Email your address to art@aarogyaseva.org. (Add $5 for outside India)Volunteers putting together supplies to be shipped and distributed in chennai and Cuddalore
A medical camp in progress at Ethiraj college in Chennai. The list of medical camps conducted, and the services offered by AarogyaSeva volunteers including tele-consultation, counseling, blood donation and public safety messaging. Join me in this 2500 mile journey from San Diego, California to
Boca Raton, Florida over a two month period starting from 15th October 2015. I hope to raise $10 for every mile
I cycle and make a sincere appeal to all of you for your support. Your help
will go a long way in helping the resilient communities who with this little
support can get access to basic quality healthcare which we often take for
granted. 

What We Need & What You Get
Village Health Camp
Organizing
monthly visit by medical and surgical teams to conduct health camps in the
villages and follow up treatments. This will be in addition to providing
medical supplies for people with chronic conditions like Diabetes,
Hypertension, thyroid, etc.
Your contribution of $500
or more can help us organize one camp and serve an average of 200 villagers in
the earthquake affected villages of Nepal. We intend to revisit every village
once in 3 months in 3 clusters of villages totaling to 12 camps in a year. This
will cost us a total of $6000($2.5 per person)      
                     
                   

Comprehensive Child
Health 
Conditions like anaemia,
malnutrition, developmental delays, stomach worms which creates discomfort and
long term impacts in children's growth and future are not only common but also
easily preventable. Identifying and treating these ailments can improve
health for the children as they develop into adults. 
Your contribution of $25
per child can help us provide the following services to the children in the
most remote and hard to reach hilly conflict ridden areas of Arunachal Pradesh,
Assam, Nagaland and Manipur. 
Screening,
medical records, deworming, nutrition supplements, Iron tablets, specialist
consultation like ophthalmology and dental will be provided as a part of the
comprehensive child health program. Awareness on menstrual hygiene, sexuality
and sexual health, communicable and non-communicable diseases, nutrition and
lifestyle will also be provided. We intend to reach out to 400 children at a total cost of
$10000.
AarogyaSeva Volunteer Clinic in Bangalore
We are lucky to have received a generous
donation of a 3500 sq.ft build room to set up a free clinic where our
volunteers can offer much needed consultations to the needy right in the heart
of Bangalore city. The building is now complete and ready to start serving
people. 
Your contribution will help us raise $10000 to equip the space
with essential basic equipment required for day-to-day functioning of the
clinic. With this we hope to reach out to an average of 5000 patients in a year. 
The Impact
We have done about 115 surgeries, treated
more than 8000 people, 60 medical camps, 10 children's camp and art
workshops, helped with about 100 temporary shelters, distributed over
15000 sanitary hygiene kits, 200 boxes of medical and surgical supplies, 13000
tarpaulins to mention a few things. We have had over 75 volunteers
including plastic and pediatric surgeons, generalists and nurses helping us
out.
The work doesn't stop here. We have a long
way to go and we intend to continue our activities. We wish to rebuild health
posts, sub posts in about 20 villages, equip them with basic instruments and
medicines for a year. We also hope to refurbish operating rooms in some
hospitals. Solar grid for 2 villages with the help of rotary, street light,
water tanks with motors and toilets in the colonies where we have set up
temporary shelters. We will have medical teams doing follow up and treatments
for about a year. We will also be hoping to take care of health needs of 10000
children in schools as a part of the comprehensive school health program.
You can help us serve 2500 villagers through the rural health
camps, reach out to 400 children in the remote villages of north east India and
provide free consultations to 5000 people in Bangalore.
We have so far benefited over 50000 people access quality
healthcare services through our volunteer network. Our teams of dedicated
volunteers are ever ready to serve and provide opportunities for others to join
the team.  
Risks & Challenges
With over 10 years of hand-on experience
serving the communities the AarogyaSeva team is hardworking and determined to
make volunteering into a movement that can help community’s access quality
healthcare at no cost or low cost.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>What's special about this product?</i></b></h2>
<p>The TapaReef Pre-Swim Hair Mask is a unique, multifunctional, water-resistant, cream formula which is applied before swimming to seal and protect the hair from the elements, and when used with the TapaReef Baobab Oil Enriched Shampoo and Conditioner leaves post-swim hair soft and rejuvenated.</p>
<p>Baobab protein is the key ingredient of the TapaReef haircare line. This unique anti-aging treatment sustainably sourced from the seed of the iconic African Baobab “tree of life” provides intense protection from UV-stress &amp; heat, helps prolong color and keratin treatments and deeply nourishes hair for greater manageability and reduced breakage during wet combing.  The products are manufactured in Australia and are free of sulphates, parabens, PEGs and silicone.</p>

<p>In tests conducted on hair that had been relaxed, colored or bleached then treated with Baobab Tein NPNF™ , up to 10% improvement in elasticity and 29% improvement in strength was observed and up to 10% reduction in frizz.  In tests on hair that was placed in a UV chamber,   Baobab Tein NPNF ™ treatment  was found to protect hair from UV degradation for up to 16 hours. </p>

<p><b><i>Stage one fully funded</i></b></p>
<p>The TapaReef Pre and Post Swim Hair Care range has been more than two years in creation; involving collaboration with a cosmetic chemist, manufacturer and packaging supplier to develop a proprietary formula using natural ingredients with low environmental impact to  protect and restore hair both before and after going in the ocean or pool.

</div></div>","What's special about this product?
The TapaReef Pre-Swim Hair Mask is a unique, multifunctional, water-resistant, cream formula which is applied before swimming to seal and protect the hair from the elements, and when used with the TapaReef Baobab Oil Enriched Shampoo and Conditioner leaves post-swim hair soft and rejuvenated.
Baobab protein is the key ingredient of the TapaReef haircare line. This unique anti-aging treatment sustainably sourced from the seed of the iconic African Baobab “tree of life” provides intense protection from UV-stress & heat, helps prolong color and keratin treatments and deeply nourishes hair for greater manageability and reduced breakage during wet combing.  The products are manufactured in Australia and are free of sulphates, parabens, PEGs and silicone.

In tests conducted on hair that had been relaxed, colored or bleached then treated with Baobab Tein NPNF™ , up to 10% improvement in elasticity and 29% improvement in strength was observed and up to 10% reduction in frizz.  In tests on hair that was placed in a UV chamber,   Baobab Tein NPNF ™ treatment  was found to protect hair from UV degradation for up to 16 hours. 
How does it work?


What's in it?
The TapaReef Pre and Post Swim Hair Care is made from plant oils that contain essential amino acids, vitamins and natural UV protection to protect and condition hair.  The products contain no sulphates, parabens, PEGs or silicone.


 

What Do We Need?
We are now looking to raise $30,000 through a pre-order and perks campaign to fund the production of the second manufacturing run of 5,000 units.  It is important to our core philosophy that we source our products and packaging from Australian and U.S. suppliers so we can ensure the quality and sustainability of our components.  This results in an awesome product but comes at an increased cost. Pre-orders from our supporters will allow us to order a higher quantity of units thereby receiving a volume discount that directly impacts our ability to provide our loyal customers with an ongoing supply at the best price possible.
 
What Will You Get?



About us
Our team are passionate surfers, travellers and outdoor sports enthusiasts. TapaReef is incorporated in Florida, USA and NSW, Australia.  We believe you can be adventurous at any age or skill level and should still be able to look good while living your dream. We are constantly looking for ways to simplify an active lifestyle and have created this company to develop a line of custom formulated personal care products to meet the needs of the surf/sport/travel community.
Our proven experience
Our first product TapaReef Sunscreen Remover facial towelettes was launched in October 2015.  These facial wipes were specifically developed to remove zinc and water resistant sunscreen after swimming, surfing or other water sports.  The biodegradable and compostable towelettes are manufactured in the U.S. from all natural ingredients that contain fruit extracts, antioxidants and anti-inflammatories designed for after-sun skin care.  They are currently sold on our website www.tapareef.com, Amazon.com and select retail outlets and are promoted by professional surfers both in the U.S. and Australia.
Stage one fully funded
The TapaReef Pre and Post Swim Hair Care range has been more than two years in creation; involving collaboration with a cosmetic chemist, manufacturer and packaging supplier to develop a proprietary formula using natural ingredients with low environmental impact to  protect and restore hair both before and after going in the ocean or pool. The first run of 1,000 units of  the TapaReef Pre-Swim Hair Mask and TapaReef Baobab Oil Enriched Shampoo and Conditioner will be ready for shipping to Australia in May 2017 and to the U.S. in June 2017.
Stage two completed
Manufacturing for the TapaReef Pre and Post Swim Hair Care is completed and the products are now available for sale in Australia and a shipment arriving into the U.S. on June 3, 2017 ready for immediate shipping.

Impact

With your support, we can continue to develop and manufacture products to help active people live big, look good and look after themselves and the planet with products that protect skin and hair from exposure to the environment's harsher elements but with minimal environmental impact.
In addition, TapaReef will donate 1% of sales to  1% For The Planet, a global network of businesses, nonprofits and individuals working together for a healthy planet. The non-profit organisation started  in 2002 by Yvon Chouinard (founder of Patagonia) and Craig Mathews (founder of Blue Ribbon Flies) to date has given over $150 Million dollars back to the environment by connecting dollars with doers to help create partnerships that protect the planet.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I think everyone’s gym bag has a work out glove to protect your hands and probably some wraps for your wrists (elbows knees) when maxing out with heavy weights.</p>

<p>The basis for the creation of this product came from the lack of a durable glove with wrist wraps that actually uses the right material for support.  </p>
<p>Searching through all the sporting goods stores both online and offline, I cannot find one product that matches my needs. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497604694/j2jg6vthobi03bwq8hmw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>What I had to do in the past is to wear a wrist wrap with another glove.  So spending twice the money to have a non functional, ugly, and uncomfortable set up.   Since I can’t find a real 2 in 1 glove, I decided to simply create one.  </p>
<p>The key to quality is simply the material used.  We ensure that not only wraps are at the highest quality but also the hand gloves are as durable as you can find.  I personally workout 5-6 times a week (sometimes twice a day). Pervious experiences with inferior gloves lasts about 2-3 months.  </p>

<p>Yoga for wellness Tanzanian was conceived about 3 years ago when I spent about 9 months taking care of my father in the hospital. During this time the only thing that got us both through this difficult time was Yoga (breathing techniques and meditation). </p>
<p>Yoga for Wellness Tanzania was born last year with the mission to introduce through training and development/education (teacher training programs),  the awareness of the benefits to be derived from the practice of holistic care, yoga principles and methods in terms of well-being and healthy living.

During this time the only thing that got us both through this difficult time was Yoga (breathing techniques and meditation). 
Yoga for Wellness Tanzania was born last year with the mission to introduce through training and development/education (teacher training programs),  the awareness of the benefits to be derived from the practice of holistic care, yoga principles and methods in terms of well-being and healthy living. Thus Impacting not only our students or participants, but also their communities, and our society.
What We Have Done:
We have completed our first pilot project. With our first teacher training program our graduates are now spreading the knowledge of love of yoga, providing information to communities on wellbeing through yoga, health benefits and reduction in medical costs.  
Two of our graduates are now teaching recovering women with Fistula and are focusing on helping women within their communities who are under privileged. These graduates have found their calling and are spreading their wings with yoga.
Yoga for Wellness Tanzania ongoing training and development programmes have been developed to ensure we have readily available members, workshops and sessions that make a true impact through connection, empathy and understanding with people.
What We Need 
Funding for a 12 month project which will include 2 teacher training programs and a minimum of 4 regional training sessions.
The resources needed for the teacher training programme include:

Trainer costs
Travel costs/Accommodation for trainer
Material for training
Transport for participants
Certificate

To run the project we need:

Transport to regions within Tanzania
Accommodation during travel
Material for participants (yoga mats)
Allowance for trainers
Rent for space

To reach our goal we have worked out the following budget:



Above budget will enable a minimum of 20 participants per training cycle which will include the following:

100 hours of community service per participant (education or health institute)
Certificates upon completion of training and community service
Ongoing training at Yoga for Wellness Tanzania (holistic/yoga)
Thorough understanding of holistic care/yoga health benefits and wellbeing

What you get:
You will be a part of the Yoga for Wellness Tanzania community and a part of a ground breaking upheaval of healing through community integration and peace for the underprivileged within Tanzania (urban and regional)
 
A little more about us:
Yoga for Wellness Tanzania first teacher training program:
Graduates from our first teacher training program who had the opportunity to participate on stage in Dar-es-Salaam Tanzania during the International Day of Yoga 2016. 
 


 
 
Fistula girls taking on the community project:
Teacher training graduates have completed their community service and are now certified yoga instructors who are teaching within the community other women with fistula, family and friends

<p><strong>Globale Medicum Insurance</strong> is the first insurance company that covers alternative medical treatments in the world. Now, allow us share our revolutionary story with you.</p>

<p>More than sixteen years ago Dr. Rickard Briggs D.el started our first healthcare company designed to help people find medical procedures around the world at an affordable cost (<a href=""http://affordablemedicalservices.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AMS</a>). As we built our network of hospitals, research centers and doctors; we made numerous exciting discoveries. The most enlightening was the advancement of new and experiential medical treatments, surgeries and therapies.<a href=""http://es.tinypic.com?ref=2qsayxv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Image and video hosting by TinyPic"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i64.tinypic.com/2qsayxv.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>Only after years of navigating the global healthcare community we came to understand why many of these new lifesaving and quality of life improving procedures were not being utilized. We started to understand the limitations, circumstances and reasons for the lack of information and communication. The holistic answer: Many countries, healthcare communities and governmental agencies have yet to adapt to a new global healthcare community.</p>
<p>Once we identified the problem <strong>our mission</strong> became to establish a database to communicate on a global level and in multiple tiers this mass amount of information.  As we researched extensively over the next decade we were able to develop a plan to not only provide the information for a global healthcare network, but to fund it as well. The result is Globale Medicum Insurance (<a href=""http://www.globaleinsurance.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GMI</a>) and its subsidiaries. </p>

<p>At the core of our insurance company is this: do the right thing, for the right reason and with a purposeful heart. It is the founding principle of GMI and our driving force. Our success lies not in the profitability of a company, but rather in the benefit we offer to those in need. <strong>We have been inspired by witnessing people who were told there was no hope or they would not walk, see, hear or have a normal life and defied their medical prognosis and survive.<a href=""http://es.tinypic.com?ref=wsojf9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Image and video hosting by TinyPic"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i65.tinypic.com/wsojf9.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></a></strong></p>
<p>We believe each person has the opportunity and obligation to create change to better the world we live in. Globale Medicum Insurance has been created to initially provide coverage for “experimental”, “investigational” and “New” treatments. By offering a financial solution and opportunities for people to secure treatment that would otherwise be unavailable or unknown in their country of origin we start the journey of changing the way healthcare and insurance companies operate.</p>
<p>By creating a platform of communication, information, assistance and services we do insurance differently and with a long term objective to creating a new medical paradigm for international healthcare.</p>
<p><strong>Our success is validated with every patient who’s life if saved or improved.</strong></p>

As we built our network of hospitals, research centers and doctors; we made numerous exciting discoveries. The most enlightening was the advancement of new and experiential medical treatments, surgeries and therapies.
Only after years of navigating the global healthcare community we came to understand why many of these new lifesaving and quality of life improving procedures were not being utilized. We started to understand the limitations, circumstances and reasons for the lack of information and communication. The holistic answer: Many countries, healthcare communities and governmental agencies have yet to adapt to a new global healthcare community.
Once we identified the problem our mission became to establish a database to communicate on a global level and in multiple tiers this mass amount of information.  As we researched extensively over the next decade we were able to develop a plan to not only provide the information for a global healthcare network, but to fund it as well. The result is Globale Medicum Insurance (GMI) and its subsidiaries. 
 

At the core of our insurance company is this: do the right thing, for the right reason and with a purposeful heart. It is the founding principle of GMI and our driving force. Our success lies not in the profitability of a company, but rather in the benefit we offer to those in need. We have been inspired by witnessing people who were told there was no hope or they would not walk, see, hear or have a normal life and defied their medical prognosis and survive.
We believe each person has the opportunity and obligation to create change to better the world we live in. Globale Medicum Insurance has been created to initially provide coverage for “experimental”, “investigational” and “New” treatments. By offering a financial solution and opportunities for people to secure treatment that would otherwise be unavailable or unknown in their country of origin we start the journey of changing the way healthcare and insurance companies operate.
By creating a platform of communication, information, assistance and services we do insurance differently and with a long term objective to creating a new medical paradigm for international healthcare.
Our success is validated with every patient who’s life if saved or improved.

I refused to allow these circumstances to determine my life. I completed a Bachelor's in Communication Studies as a ward of the state until the age of 21 and a Master's Degree in Special Education.

<p>After about a year of self healing with sound I began offering sound massages to others. I was ecstatic to find that so many people found relief through this service. I was traveling at the time and after serving over 100 people, I decided to return to the US and identify a way to make this accessible to undeserved communities. Within one month of arriving to San Francisco, I had secured a part-time position at the <a href=""https://www.ymcasf.org/locations/bayview-hunters-point-ymca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YMCA in the Bayview/Hunter's Point community</a>. I currently work about 7.5 hrs a week and serve community members at the YMCA site and at the <a href=""https://bhpmss.org/dr-george-w-davis-senior-center/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dr. George Davis Senior Center</a> workshops are free for San Francisco residents and YMCA members. I would like to expand this project into my own business. </p>
<p>I have served over 200 people in the last two years on a donation/pay what you can basis in three different countries.</p>
<p><strong>In the last year:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I started the first sound healing program at the SF YMCA and George Davis Senior Center and it is FREE for all San Francisco residents.</li>
<li>I forged relationships between local cannabis businesses and holistic health. Making sound healing available to patients.</li>
<li>I connected with local artists and events and have offered free sound healing for non-profit workers in Oakland and on a donation base for patrons, meditation, and self-healing groups. Example, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/nekiaiken/yoga-to-live-music-nicole-yarbourgh-brian-axel-nekia-wright"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yoga to Live Music</a>.</li>
<li>My position at the YMCA is the first of it's kind.I created a job in an emerging industry with a national non-profit. If this project is successful, there is potential for many more jobs for many more people at other YMCA.</li>
<li>Applied for a fellowship that will provide start-up capital and business coaching.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am absolutely positive that I am doing my life's work, holistic services should be available to under-served communities. Unfortunately this mission is not valued by the mainstream and I have had to make many sacrifices.</p>
<p>Emotional health is of the utmost importance. <a href=""http://upliftconnect.com/why-sound-heals/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sound healing</a> alongside emotional coaching offers an opportunity for community members to come together and heal themselves.

I connected with myself through sounds. Four years later I used humming to connect with my body following a diagnosis of prostate cancer. No one knew it that I established a relationship with the robot machine producing a high pitch sound during radiotherapy. </div><div> </div><div>
<strong>Polyphonic Humming </strong>is my invention and requires a sense of presence, aural training, intention and a skill that can be taught using technology, hence this campaign. By doing so we can develop a sense of ourselves and the others by creating a new space in between. This technique is different from a talking therapy as it tackles on a primal sense of communication and the ability to hum which is inherent in any human being in this planet. </div><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562722345/u7heendm6a8xokeoemfp.jpg"" src=""""/></div><div> </div><div> </div><p><strong>Sound is vibration and energy.</strong> I am  composer, music teacher for autism and<strong> <a href=""https://www.creativepiano.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pianist</a></strong> also known as the<strong> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmvp484z2e6EvIqM-LfpJwA?view_as=subscriber"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Humming Man</a></strong>. I am passionate about how the power of a simple communal harmonic humming technique I created over the years to help many people to beat isolation, to empower themselves  and deal with mental health and emotional problems in a supportive environment. </p><p><strong>Mind and Body connection </strong>We are the results of our thoughts. I am passionate about the connection between mind and body for recovery and wellness. My approach is social and creative looking at preventive mental health by exploring creativity, empathy and resilience as part of the healing process especially when dealing with emotional wellbeing associated with long term conditions such as cancer or other chronic conditions as well as mild mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, depression related to modern lifestyle. </p><p>I am passionate about <a href=""http://changemakersmagazine.org/hum-change-wish-see/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>music</strong></a> and wellbeing, social prescription and non pharmaceutical approach to illness is the future. Communal music helps to bond people together especially when we are active creators and active listeners.  We need systems to support  and care for each other, to shift from the victim state to activism mindset, as we are social and creative beings with ups and downs.   </p><p><strong>An app alone is not the solution</strong> Humming mindfulness  is a hybrid model. It relies on face to face social interactions and interconnection between people thanks to the power of vocal sounds, a primal resource available to every person in this world.

<p><b>Problem 1  We are disempowered </b>The system of care and health charities are undermining the inner power of the individual to choose to give and take as part of their healing process. As individuals we need to make  lifestyle changes, nutrition and learn other techniques and so on.</p>
<p><strong>What we know</strong> There is a full body of research showing scientific evidence about the<u> </u>positive effect of mindfulness, meditation and  singing together helping the release of endorphins in the brain. With Humming we are connecting the dots and moving a bit further. </p>
<p><strong>Problem 2 Lack of empathy as a model of care</strong> The power of the mind is underrated. The current systems doesn't value peer to peer empathy and interdependence. What if the patient becomes the doctor? </p>
<p><strong>My personal experience</strong> I have personal experience of multiple distresses ( financial, emotional, self esteem, depression, homelessness problems) but thanks to humming practise  I was able to move forward in life. My natural instinct was to share it with others. I started my recovery process when I felt useful to others, It is as simple as that.  You can experience it as well</p>
<p><strong>Cancer as an opportunity to grow</strong> Last October I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. However I was told I couldn't help others with my skills - and I mean as a volunteer - because  there are policies in place by cancer support charities which prevents a cancer patient to share skills with other patients as a volunteer. </p>
<p>I wrote this blog with my<strong> <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/two-right-feet-my-healthcare-neglects-we-social-who-lopez-figueroa-/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">story</a></strong> and shared it on LinkedIn as a result I received positive feedback including nurses with cancer diagnosis who wanted to change the system.</p>
<p>The solution</p>
<strong>A sustainable business model with the user at the centre</strong>
</div><div>The individuals and <i>hummers community </i>aren't passive patients but active contributors as performers within  a global community. Once the app is up and running and training completed for quality assurance you will enable to join in the community of 'hummers' to share and add diversity to the audio content available for all. Registered users will receive a reward in form of royalties for their group creations with other registered users. </div><div> </div><div>
<strong>A shared value journey</strong> You become a co-creator of new music as well as a contributor of audio content to be used by other users. Under current copyright law, we need to work country by country over the next 10 years to make this happen as we grow . The content created by you or a in a group will generate revenue and a percentage of those equally shared royalties from revenue sales will be give to you as creator as well as being invested in our ongoing innovation and research projects to add more value providing ethical and transparent accountability open to all along the way.

This technique is different from a talking therapy as it tackles on a primal sense of communication and the ability to hum which is inherent in any human being in this planet.   Sound is vibration and energy. I am  composer, music teacher for autism and pianist also known as the Humming Man. I am passionate about how the power of a simple communal harmonic humming technique I created over the years to help many people to beat isolation, to empower themselves  and deal with mental health and emotional problems in a supportive environment. Mind and Body connection We are the results of our thoughts. I am passionate about the connection between mind and body for recovery and wellness. My approach is social and creative looking at preventive mental health by exploring creativity, empathy and resilience as part of the healing process especially when dealing with emotional wellbeing associated with long term conditions such as cancer or other chronic conditions as well as mild mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, depression related to modern lifestyle. I am passionate about music and wellbeing, social prescription and non pharmaceutical approach to illness is the future. Communal music helps to bond people together especially when we are active creators and active listeners.  We need systems to support  and care for each other, to shift from the victim state to activism mindset, as we are social and creative beings with ups and downs.   An app alone is not the solution Humming mindfulness  is a hybrid model. It relies on face to face social interactions and interconnection between people thanks to the power of vocal sounds, a primal resource available to every person in this world. This app will encourage people to connect in real life, face to face - ear to ear - building meaningful connections as an add on. Watch old pitch here https://youtu.be/qHqEDyKkjs0Are you a Spanish speaker? No problem you can check this video with subtitles too https://youtu.be/InhPPi5wjPA

 
 I can't make it without you!  For the last four years I have been working on the ground in all sorts of environments from offices, caves, under water, conferences, private homes and so on with people of all ages and backgrounds on a part-time basis receiving winning awards and recognition on innovation from Ealing Council in London, Southbank centre and most importantly, the encouragement received from participants in the mindful Humming in Harmony experiences is the best motivator to carry on as you can see on this testimonial video.  Why a HUM app and why now?It is time to move on to the next stage of development. The technique is simple and it cuts language and social barriers. In order to reach out a wider audience I need to develop a mindfulness training app and launch it to the market. 
I am not doing it alone  I wouldn't start a crowdfunding campaign without a development company on board such as Hyper. Being part of an accelerator programme is a guarantee of success to enable the idea to be launched successfully to the marketplace by September 2019.  The focus of this app is on aural vocal meditation with the use of the voice as an individual or as a communal experience. This app is for everyone but will be an add on for professionals working in healthcare, education, self development, music therapy, holistic therapies yoga and more. HUM app content preview
Listening exercises (sounds and environment)
Breathing and sound techniques (vibration, intensity, resonance)
Body check up (monitoring your data)
Aural training exercises ( pitch, frequency, harmony)
Humming improvisation ( the creative you)
Empathy Practise (sound and emotion)
Community (connecting with other hummers)
App development process 
Problem 1  We are disempowered The system of care and health charities are undermining the inner power of the individual to choose to give and take as part of their healing process. As individuals we need to make  lifestyle changes, nutrition and learn other techniques and so on.
What we know There is a full body of research showing scientific evidence about the positive effect of mindfulness, meditation and  singing together helping the release of endorphins in the brain. With Humming we are connecting the dots and moving a bit further. 
Problem 2 Lack of empathy as a model of care The power of the mind is underrated. The current systems doesn't value peer to peer empathy and interdependence. What if the patient becomes the doctor? 
My personal experience I have personal experience of multiple distresses ( financial, emotional, self esteem, depression, homelessness problems) but thanks to humming practise  I was able to move forward in life. My natural instinct was to share it with others. I started my recovery process when I felt useful to others, It is as simple as that.  You can experience it as well
Cancer as an opportunity to grow Last October I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. However I was told I couldn't help others with my skills - and I mean as a volunteer - because  there are policies in place by cancer support charities which prevents a cancer patient to share skills with other patients as a volunteer. 
I wrote this blog with my story and shared it on LinkedIn as a result I received positive feedback including nurses with cancer diagnosis who wanted to change the system.
The solution
A sustainable business model with the user at the centre
The individuals and hummers community aren't passive patients but active contributors as performers within  a global community. Once the app is up and running and training completed for quality assurance you will enable to join in the community of 'hummers' to share and add diversity to the audio content available for all. Registered users will receive a reward in form of royalties for their group creations with other registered users.  
A shared value journey You become a co-creator of new music as well as a contributor of audio content to be used by other users. Under current copyright law, we need to work country by country over the next 10 years to make this happen as we grow . The content created by you or a in a group will generate revenue and a percentage of those equally shared royalties from revenue sales will be give to you as creator as well as being invested in our ongoing innovation and research projects to add more value providing ethical and transparent accountability open to all along the way. You will have access to where the money comes and go.    Other ways you can help Part of my healing process involved drawing and I am now selling my art online to support my project as I am fully dedicated to develop this app. My full time job now is humming mindfulness to build a social enterprise so I am looking for alternative income streams as I do so which also includes...Wellbeing interactive concerts I will be delivering wellbeing concert performances to engage audiences to hum and co-create music starting with 24 pieces of classical music repertoire. You can follow me on twitter @creativepiano and using the #OneBigHum and will be able to follow me and purchase music online. Our facebook page is www.facebook.com/humminginharmonySound archive This is an example of  HUM (home) an orchestral improvised piece using the humming sequence which will be available on the app. If you are curious about previous sound recordings, you can find them here or www.humminginharmony.com This is not just about the money Sharing content and links can help us to build up a community of supporters. Your financial contribution will enable us to finally design and develop the best app experience with your feedback from the stage of app development prior to launch to market.  Do not hesitate to contact me at any moment.Finally an open call for those experiencing cancer at any stage of their lives. It would be great if you could join in as a big part of this app and community of care will be focused on people like you and me.ThanksSergio",4.0,2,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","The Founders 
      
Randy & Amanda Jordan, the founders of the Go Hard, Finish Strong fitness mobile platform decided to build this platform because they believe living a healthy life is so much more then how you look, how strong you are, how fast or far you can run, or what you eat. They believe being healthy is about moderation, motivation and finding a balance that allows you to live a strong life.
The Go Hard, Finish Strong Team

 
OUR PLAN WAS TO LAUNCH BY OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR, WE HAVE PUSHED THIS DATE BACK TO MAY OF 2020 IN ORDER TO ASSURE OUR PLATFORM ONCE LAUNCHED, IS SECURE AND WORKS PROPERLY.
The Importance Of this Platform
View the below video to see why we have chosen to build a better fitness solution!


 

Why believe in Go Hard, Finish Strong?
We will change the perception of individuals self-pride and provide them with the motivation needed to live a healthy life.
 
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, WE NEED YOUR HELP!
To see Go Hard, Finish Strong reach its full potential, we are asking you to help us raise $35,000. Your investment will help move operations forward and build a solid brand name you can be proud of. 
If we are able to raise the $35,000, we will invest every cent into the business to accomplish the following things:

$10,000 will be spent on securing the platform to protect your personal identity and provide you with the privacy needed to share information easily, accurately and securely with your friends and family.
The $10,000 we raise here will allow for the application builders to add better security and to conduct routine maintenance on the platform.

NOTE: According to Formotus.com the price range for developing an mobile app is most often from $100,000 to $500,000, see the link below for details:


https://www.formotus.com/blog/figuring-the-costs-of-custom-mobile-business-app-development

$10,000 will be spent on the design and production of our unique exclusive fitness apparel . (Only to be sold via the platform to members) (members will be able to use points earned for discounts and/or purchases of merchandise)
​To date, the founders of Go Hard, Finish Strong has secured a designer to design the sample items seen below. 
In order to move to production, we need to have Tech Packs created for each item to send to the manufacturer so they will know the proper measurements and design of each item. Tech packs cost on average $50 to $400 each piece, each size. 
For details on the cost of Tech Packs please visit the link below: 


https://fashioninsiders.co/toolkit/how-to/sample-development-cost/
$15,000 will be spent on marketing and operations in order to move the platform forward.If raised, these funds will be spent primarily on marketing, creating advertisement products, attending events to promote the platform and other day to day operations.

The $35,000 we are looking to raise will help us get one step closer to the platform being a global change towards improving health and fitness in everyday life. However, it is not our overall goal to raise just $35,000, we are attempting to raise in total $200,000 which would allow the founders to push the platform through the Five Stage business model they have designed. 

To date we are currently in Stage 2 of our growth plan, we are hoping you can help us make it to Stage 3. 
 
To reach our goal we have designed limited edition challenge coins which will only, only be offered this one time. 
A challenge  coin is a small coin or medallion, bearing an organization's insignia or emblem and carried by the organization's members. Traditionally, they might be given to prove membership when challenged and to enhance morale. In addition, they are also collected by service members and law enforcement personnel.
Our founders being in law enforcement, decided to create these coins because in their line of work, challenge coins represent the concept of camaraderie, strength, respect and over all the chance to be a part of something more then yourself.
We are offering four coins, each coin will provide a contributor with different perks and each coin will come with a certificate of authenticity.
There will be 1,000 coins total, 250 of each of the four coin. Each coin will offer in the beginning discounts on apparel, points towards your total points once you download the platform and other incentives to be identified through the maturity and growth of the platform.
          
 
         
If we are unable to reach our full goal of raising $35,000, we will continue to push and use any funds raised to move the business to market.

Our goal is to push the boundaries on fitness apparel by creating items that are comfortable yet strong, flexible yet fashionable and exclusive as we will not be producing a massive amount of any item. We plan to only produce small numbers of every item, this providing members with the exclusiveness of be a few to own a piece. Please see some of our designs below:

<p>Tremors are often associated with Parkinson’s disease, but they are actually heavily influential across several diseases such as Essential Tremor (ET) and Multiple Sclerosis. The fact that more than 10 million people suffer from ET speaks for itself that this issue is both urgent and pressing. Tremor patients struggle on a daily basis with everyday tasks such as eating, drinking, and writing, and they lose out on a portion of their life. Furthermore, these patients suffer psychologically from the idea that the life they are accustomed to living is slowly deteriorating. Current methods for tremor suppression lack the ability to provide user comfortability. While many of these methods are able to successfully reduce or suppress a tremor, they also act as a hindrance to the lives of many tremor patients. Apollo NeuroTech seeks to give hope to this group through TremorWear; we believe that tremors should not be a barrier to one’s everyday life. </p>
<p>That's where TremorWear comes in.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Here at Apollo NeuroTech...</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We're two passionate young innovators located near Princeton, New Jersey looking to revolutionize the tremor orthosis market with this software. We want to be able to make a tangible impact on the millions of people suffering from tremors on a daily basis, and to create an interim solution between when a neurological cure is found to diseases such as Parkinson's, and the current situation we face today.</p>
<p>We're all about creating innovative biomedical solutions. For the past year, we've been developing, hypothesizing, and advancing our first public project, TremorWear. TremorWear offers a variety of technological advancements that have the potential to revolutionize the tremor suppression market:</p>
<p>TremorWear is a device-independent tremor-suppression library designed to add smart-suppression features to wearable tremor orthosis. In the current market for tremor-suppression, products tend to burden patients because they constantly apply an excessive amount of force to suppress their users’ tremors. TremorWear dissolves this issue for any wearable tremor device by determining the necessary force for them. The groundbreaking software can ultimately revolutionize the tremor market by helping contemporary products know where and how a tremor will arise. TremorWear interfaces smoothly with smart-locking mechanisms, or mechanisms which can alter the force they apply on a patient’s wrist. The system itself is not meant to be sold to consumers; its purpose is to be licensed to other firms. Currently, there is no system on the market that can accurately determine the minimum amount of force needed to suppress a tremor in real-time and adapt to any tremor orthosis device, making TremorWear a piece of revolutionary technology. With patented technology and innovative use of neural networks, TremorWear can predict where and how a tremor will arise.</p>

<h3>Why Do We Need Funding?</h3>

</ul>
<p>We've already been able to achieve up to 90% accuracy for tremor motion, but with your support, we can conduct large scale testing to push that number above 95%.If we don't gain the entirety of our goal, the funding we gain can still go toward our early prototypes and partnerships with other firms; we intend to make use of all the support we can get and put it towards making our tremor suppression software compatible with contemporary products.</p>

<p>We want you to join the Apollo NeuroTech family through your support with TremorWear. This  biomedical product has the potential to greatly impact those living in the U.S., but we want to make TremorWear universal. The patented technology that TremorWear brings to the orthopedics market provides a new method to predict tremors without restricting volunteer motion. Through the use of neural networks and revolutionary technology, TremorWear can send tremor modern products to the next level by allowing for a device that can fully suppress a tremor.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>TremorWear Capabilities</h2>
<p>Since TremorWear is device independent, it is compatible with any delay a device may have, making it diverse and highly versatile. Part of our patented neural network process is shown below:</p>

<p>TremorWear operates through a fluid integration system with actuators to directly suppress a tremor. By determining the exact necessary force to counteract a tremor and accounting for any delays an actuator may have, TremorWear is an integral part of creating a working tremor orthosis device.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Apollo NeuroTech is seeking support to develop better and more advanced prototypes for TremorWear, and we intend to obtain a patent for this revolutionary technology. We hope that the technology can gain enough funding so that it can be publicized to a great extent, ultimately resulting in a noticeable impact for those suffering from tremors. We intend to overcome any budgeting issues through meticulous planning and various input sources from our innovators and supporters. Some potential barriers:</p>

   Source: Harvard Health Publishing   Over the past three years, we validated Bello’s ability to measure fat at  Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. Belly fat medical-grade measurement requires a person to be exposed to radiation from 10 to 30 minutes and trained specialists to work on analyzing the results.A  technology validation study was conducted and Bello measurements were confirmed to be strongly correlated with the Computed Tomography (CT) Scan for subcutaneous and visceral fat.Bello provides a better measurement of belly fat that is associated with metabolic disease when compared to Body Mass Index (BMI).BMI (Body Mass Index) is widely used as a measure of weight, but it is not strongly correlated with abdomen fat as shown in the graph above.  Weight doesn't tell you how much belly fat you have. As a critical indicator of chronic diseases, belly fat should be closely monitored and managed for your metabolic health.This clinical trial was conducted with CT (Computerized Tomography) as a reference.  Please click here for more details about the study.  ​Bello's proprietary DMW-NIRS (Discrete Multi-Wavelengths Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) technology scans the belly area for an accurate belly fat analysis while other body fat scales utilize BIA (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis). Both BIA and NIR instruments can provide accuracy equal to the Gold Standard hydrostatic weighing technique for determining percent body fat.BIA has more restrictions in use due to its sensitivity to the hydration level of a bodywhile NIR provides accurate and consistent measurement without those restrictions.  Near-infrared technology behind Bello measures lipid, water, oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. Bello is the first and only portable device that can directly quantify lipid underneath the skin and provide the most accurate measurement of belly fat, anytime anywhere.    EARN CASH REWARDS FOR SHARING Click on the image to earn 3% cash of contributions from your own referral link.        We are able to ship worldwide except for the following countries due to difficult shipping conditions: Russia, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, and Mexico.

<h3>It is important for me to create an old fashioned book. Something that has a real, feely, touchy, lasting potential. </h3>
<p>Something that can be passed on to your children and grandchildren. It can be shared with friends. You can write in it, highlight it, get it full of sand or chocolate smudged fingers, coffee and chai stains. It tells a story, not only of what is written on the pages, but of the books physical life. From its life before you and after you. </p>
<p>After 15-years of publishing new media products myself, like DVDs, CDs, Video on Demand and the 1st ever Ashtanga Yoga App for the iPhone, I wanted to do  something more old school. In this exploding era of social media, everything is so short lived. Nothing lasts!</p>
<p>I wanted to create something that has the traditional juice of the ancient teachings of yoga. Something that lasts. So that the true heart of the teaching can be preserved and maintained. Just as they have been for thousands of years. The only way you could learn was from a Guru or Master, or from books. </p>
<h3><strong>This is what and why we are creating!</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>Our Remaining Steps</h2>
<p>By collaborating on this book you are supporting our production, publishing and distribution plan for a high quality, full-color, highly photographic, 250+ pages book. The book is fully written! Hundreds of photographs have already been shot, edited and incorporated into design. This book design is in the final stage. We only need to shoot a few more stylised photographs and do one final round of editing to wrap it up. </p>
<p>We have set an initial target of US$ 29,000.<br/>And anything beyond this will allow us to increase the quantity of the initial print run, making the book available to more people around the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Amazing Perks</h2>
<p>The creative perks we are offering are all completely in line with the book at hand. They are all based around Gannon's teachings.</p>
<p>In addition to limited edition, personally signed books, we are offering:</p>
<p>- Spaces in Michael Gannon Yoga Teacher Trainings in Mexico.</p>
<p>- Spaces in Gannon Yoga Retreats on Holbox Island or Bacalar Bay, both in Mexico.</p>
<p>- Private Classes with Gannon; in person at Yogaloft, virtually live over Skype or for your own  private group in your own home, anywhere on the planet. </p>
<p>-Different Book Bundle Perks to choose from that include; Gannon's Signature Yoga Mat or Signature Yoga Mala, both by Yoga Dealer, Gannon Yoga Video on Demand or Discounted Membership at Yogaloft Playa del Carmen, Gannon's school in Mexico. </p>
<p>- A Gannon Yoga Workshop weekend at your yoga school or community.</p>
<p>- Personalised thank you written within the book credits.</p>
<p>- We even have a perk that allows you the title of Co-Publisher of this Book!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Minimal Risk</h2>
<p>We have a strong pre-launch campaign response and fully expect to reach our target. If we do not, it simply means we will be able to print less books in this first run. Which is all the reason NOT to wait till the book is actually on the shelves. Better to guarantee your copy by collaborating with this crowdfunding campaign now :)</p>
<p>I have had lots of experience producing and publishing projects like this including 4 DVDs, CDs, Posters, Video on Demand and the first ever Ashtanga Yoga App for the iPhone. </p>

<h2><strong>Michael Gannon, TheYoga Dealer</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Yoga found Michael after 10 years of chaotic deal making in the American advertising and music business. Through his yoga practice he was awakened to incredible balancing benefits that would gradually change his life path. Gannon spent 10 years studying with the late Sri. K. Pattabhi Jois, learning the 1st, 2nd and 3rd series of the traditional Ashtanga Vinyasa system. He was authorized directly by Jois in 2001 to teach, and Gannon then spent the next 15 years travelling and teaching Ashtanga in over 40 countries on 5 continents. <br/><br/>Michael’s unique teaching style makes Yoga’s transformational powers — physical, mental and spiritual — available to all. He has imparted both of these styles by training over 350 teachers worldwide in his Teacher Trainings since 2002.  </p>
<p>Michael founded the Yoga Dealer brand in 2005. He has also created the instructional breathing audio program, <i>Awaken Your Life Force and Quiet Your Mind</i>, three DVDs; <i>Opening Your Lotus — Elements of Sitting</i>, <i>Opening Your Heart — Elements of Backbending</i>, <i>From Earth to Heaven</i>, and three Yoga practice posters used by practitioners around the world. 2011 brought <i>Ashtanga Yoga with Michael Gannon</i>, the first Ashtanga Yoga app for the iPhone / iPad / iPod Touch and Android. When The Yoga Dealer is not traveling, he spends time at the feet of his three most powerful Gurus, on their home beach in Mexico — his daughter and two sons.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and in 2013, Gannon shocked the yoga world by designing and building one of the most beautiful new yoga schools on the planet, <strong>Yogaloft Playa del Carmen</strong> (yogaloftplaya.com ).</p>

Michael Gannon, TheYoga Dealer
 
Yoga found Michael after 10 years of chaotic deal making in the American advertising and music business. Through his yoga practice he was awakened to incredible balancing benefits that would gradually change his life path. Gannon spent 10 years studying with the late Sri. K. Pattabhi Jois, learning the 1st, 2nd and 3rd series of the traditional Ashtanga Vinyasa system. He was authorized directly by Jois in 2001 to teach, and Gannon then spent the next 15 years travelling and teaching Ashtanga in over 40 countries on 5 continents. Michael’s unique teaching style makes Yoga’s transformational powers — physical, mental and spiritual — available to all. He has imparted both of these styles by training over 350 teachers worldwide in his Teacher Trainings since 2002.  
Michael founded the Yoga Dealer brand in 2005. He has also created the instructional breathing audio program, Awaken Your Life Force and Quiet Your Mind, three DVDs; Opening Your Lotus — Elements of Sitting, Opening Your Heart — Elements of Backbending, From Earth to Heaven, and three Yoga practice posters used by practitioners around the world. 2011 brought Ashtanga Yoga with Michael Gannon, the first Ashtanga Yoga app for the iPhone / iPad / iPod Touch and Android. When The Yoga Dealer is not traveling, he spends time at the feet of his three most powerful Gurus, on their home beach in Mexico — his daughter and two sons.Oh yeah, and in 2013, Gannon shocked the yoga world by designing and building one of the most beautiful new yoga schools on the planet, Yogaloft Playa del Carmen (yogaloftplaya.com ).

</div></div>","Be Inspired To Get Up In the MorningThe first 15 minutes of the morning often sets the tone for the rest of our day. Whether we are in a rush to get out the door or have ample time, we all practice regular bathroom routines that help us prepare for the day ahead.For example, brushing our teeth and bathing are essential tasks that maintain our overall health and wellness. Many of us also like to prepare for a day by reviewing our schedule and checking the weather and traffic reports to avoid the unexpected. All in all, we spend a fixed amount of time on a daily basis maintaining our health and mentally preparing for the upcoming day.Wavee has developed the W-1 - the world’s first electric toothbrush speaker system - to enhance the everyday bathroom experience with an innovative concept that blends our commitment to effective oral care with modern technology. The W-1 works double duty in the bathroom through a seamless integration of two devices that perform important functions within a person’s daily routine. The first is an electric toothbrush built with leading technology to provide effective teeth cleaning through a powerful 3-speed motor and sonic wave brush head - the second is an accompanying water-resistant speaker with a built in charging base for the brush. Wavee’s speaker delivers full and rich-sounding audio, allowing users to consume their favourite content - music, podcasts, audiobooks and more - while they are getting ready in the bathroom. Through technology and innovative design, the Wavee team has fused these two functions together to create the market’s first electric toothbrush and integrated speaker product - creating an entirely new and unique user experience. The W-1 is the missing piece that will help transform the common bathroom space into a secluded haven, maximizing the time (sometimes up to 60 minutes/day or more) users spend before taking on the day.   To kickoff 2020, Wavee officially unveiled the W-1 to the public at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. To our appreciation, the feedback and response from the media, attendees and follow exhibitor was overwhelmingly positive. The event served as a platform for us to capture user feedback in real-time, expand our network and forge new connections that will ultimately help drive the Wavee brand forward. After 4 days of fun and hard work, the team is even more excited to deliver this product in March 2020.   From its lightweight design to its custom toothbrush Wavee pattern grip and wall mount option, W-1 is designed with an attention to detail that makes it easy to use in any bathroom setting. It’s taken us 18 months of prototyping and testing to develop this breakthrough technology.Wall Mount
 
 
Save precious real estate on your bathroom vanity by mounting Wavee on your wall, mirror or any flat surface. 
 The bathroom is a sacred place for many people. It’s where we go to prepare ourselves for the world, make sure we look our best, and often times it serves as a quiet place to take a breath during a busy day. On a daily basis, time spent in the bathroom feels fairly insignificant, but a new survey out of the United Kingdom finds that the average adult will spend well more than a year of their lives in the bathroom.According to a survey of 2,000 British adults - men will spend 373 days, or 23 minutes per day; and women will spend 456 days, or 29 minutes per day. Taking the chore out of oral hygieneEveryday oral care is considered an essential preventative measure against bacteria, disease, inflammation and other systemic health concerns that can affect not only our mouths, but our entire body. Wavee’s dentist-recommended electric toothbrush provides powerful and quiet cleaning in three separate modes (each with a convenient two-minute timer) and a long-lasting lithium ion battery lasts up to 25 days on one charge. Dental research evidently shows that electric toothbrushes improve oral heath by as much as 10x when used twice a day. But the W-1 toothbrush is only the tip of the iceberg. Wavee truly believes that the key to improving oral care is to make it a habit instead of a chore. To do that, Wavee wants to put the best tools in your hands and create a bathroom experience unlike ever before. We put our prototype in the hands of Jorge Nunez Jr. (Wavee's Director of Dental Relations) and a focus group of New York City-based dentists and dental hygienists - collectively boasting over 50 years of experience - and we were blown away by the feedback from these industry experts...   What's up Doc? Here is what dental professionals had to say about the W-1:     Three Brushing Modes  Three different brushing modes are controlled through the illuminated power button, ranging from Standard (41,000 RPM), White (48,000 RPM) and Sensitive (33,000 RPM) - all using the sonic wave movement.Two-minute timer with 30-second intervalsDentists recommend that you brush your teeth for two minutes to ensure a sufficient clean for all areas of your mouth, and we have a built-in timer that automatically shuts the brush off when time is up.Charge lasts up to 25 daysThe brush is powered by a long lasting Lithium Ion battery which can last up to 240 minutes (Sensitive mode), so don’t worry about losing power when you bring your brush along when travelling. The electric toothbrush is inductively charged by the speaker unit through magnets when placed in the designated charging area. 48,000 RPM motorWhen building the W-1 electric toothbrush, we were determined to build a brush that not only looks innovative on the outside, but can also perform with the industry's best. The unique outer design is backed by a powerful 48,000 RPM motor that provides your teeth with a dentist-like clean.  Studies show that listening to music has numerous benefits - including improving your overall mood, lowered stress levels, increased productivity and strengthening brain skills like learning and memory. Some consider music as the original 'miracle drug' and the W-1 is cleverly positioned to help users maximize every minute of the day. Kick your day off with the right playlist; get ready for a night out with some bumping beats; and wind down for the evening with some toned-down tracks. Wavee is there to help set the mood. Wavee injects life into your bathroom and eliminates your boring daily routine.
No more under-powered cell phone speakers
No more hassle of bringing a speaker in and out of the bathroom 
No more worrying about water damage to your speaker or phone 
The W-1 speaker unit was designed with one sole purpose: perform in the bathroom environment. We made sure to go through every different user scenario in the bathroom to make sure that Wavee is ready for anything your throw at it.IPX 5 WATER RESISTANT 


Designed and engineered for the bathroom environment, the W-1's speaker boasts an IPX 5 rating, providing exceptional resistance to water splashes, low-pressure jet sprays and moisture from shower steam. 
Bluetooth 5.0 Connectivity
The W-1 Speaker boasts Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity, the latest iteration of Bluetooth wireless technology. It offers improved data transfer speed (twice as fast as its predecessor, 4.2), increased connectivity range (800 feet or four times the range) and larger data transfer size (8 times).
Amazon Alexa Compatible 
 
The W-1 can make multi-tasking in the morning a breeze. With Amazon Alexa, your personal virtual assistant, use your voice to initiate your music player, create a to-do list, set an alarm, stream a podcast, play audiobooks, report on the weather, traffic, sports and news. Alexa can also control other smart devices using itself as a home automation system. Wavee will be sent to Amazon factories in February 2019 for official Alexa certification. 
Lithium Ion Battery Charge
The Lithium Ion battery inside of the speaker provides 8 hours of continuous audio playback and 240 minutes of brush time. When its time to charge the speaker, conveniently connect via the provided USB-C cable. 
Rich, Omni-Directional Sound
Enjoy your favorite audio content streamed from your phone or music service through full, deep bass and clear and defined tones. The W-1's custom driver design utilizes the latest passive radiator technology to produce a surround sound experience that radiates through your entire bathroom.
Clean Sleeve
Each W-1 unit comes packed with a detachable clean sleeve that acts as a mounting cradle for your brush and a protective layer between the charging pad and brush. The sleeve is detachable for cleaning, ensuring your unit is looking great at all times.  

Choose your weapon of choice! The W-1 will be available in Pearl White/Rose Gold and Cool Grey/Rose Gold for both the toothbrush and the speaker components. 


We believe the W-1 is in a league of its own simply because there is no single product on the market to make a direct comparison. Those hoping to build a similar package with separate components (brush + speaker) are going to 'break the bank' - but with the W-1 you get both products that are engineered to work in sync at a very reasonable price. Since Wavee is direct-to-consumer, we cut out the middle man and invest more into features. Not only do we care about giving you a premium product, The W-1 is hands-down the best BANG FOR THE BUCK.

The built-in infrared warmth and pulsating massager relax your sore neck after work, before falling asleep with soft music playing through the built-in speaker. Best of all, when you fall asleep, the pillow will automatically switch off all the electronics in 30 minutes, turning Jself into the pillow of your dreams, literally.Reviewed by Chigz Tech

 
 Many of us wake up with a sore neck and back, and by using our computer all day, we'll make sure we're coming home feeling even worse.Jself helps relieve this by providing three solutions in one great pillow. The massager and infrared therapy help you relax tense muscles in your neck when you come home from work. When it’s time to sleep, the contoured, soft but supporting natural latex will help you fall asleep fast and wake up refreshed without neck or back pain. Throughout our lifetime, we spend an enormous 26 years asleep. Surprisingly, we also spend 7 years trying to get to sleep. That's 33 years or 12,045 days spent in bed.So a premium pillow is not really a luxury as it plays an important role in your sleep. Why don't you get a fantastic pillow which can help relieve your sore muscles after work? And how much are you willing to pay for a sound sleep?

We’ve integrated an infrared therapy and massaging unit into the pillow, delivering soothing warmth and relaxing vibrations after a long day at work. They can be used together or individually, and different modes give you a customized experience for optimal relaxation.The pillow is designed to release tension in your neck, relaxing and recharging you, whether you’re resting, or recharging for a night-shift.Don’t worry about falling asleep with the infrared or massager still turned on, Jself will stop working in 30 minutes when you fall asleep and turns off all the electronics. Take a deep breath and relax with the built-in pulsating massager. Just close your eyes and imagine the gentle touch of a masseur rubbing your neck. If rough is what you're into, that's fine, we won't judge, our pillow comes with three different modes. Jself has built-in speakers, that’s fancy talk for a new type of speaker that only you can hear, not the people next to you. The pillow comes with its own set of snooze-inducing tunes, but you can also connect your phone to play your favorite white noise and music.Listen to our beautiful built-in music, or wirelessly connect your phone. You can even stream the audio of your favorite shows through the pillow if you're watching Netflix in bed and don't want to disturb the person next to you. The Jself pillow is entirely made out of natural latex, responsibly derived from trees. Not only does it offer great support for your back and neck, it is naturally hypoallergenic. It's how mother nature wants you to sleep.  So what makes the Jself pillow so great at its job of relaxing you? Every feature we've added to the pillow has been researched extensively. From the right temperature of the infrared heat to the most relaxing frequency of the massager. Below you'll find a bit more about the science behind the Jself pillow.  We've tried different pillow fabrics before ultimately settling on graphene. This luxury material which is very soft to the touch and conducts heat extremely well, which helps with the infrared heating option. Different people, different preferences so we designed three different heating modes to choose from. It's luxury meeting science at its finest.Whether you’re a side- or back sleeper, Jself gives great support to your back and neck with its ergonomic design. Jself is not just some massage gadget, your chiropractor would be proud of you for sleeping on it because it offers great support throughout the night. The latex core has air holes to keep you cool, so you won’t wake up in a sweat. The air holes are designed to make Jself even more breathable and dry, sleep better at a pleasant temperature. Teamwork makes the dream work, literally. The incredible sleep scientists at our R&D center have had many sleepless nights to ensure you can, well, sleep!

<p>Since the dawn of time, humans have found creative ways to clean up after pooping: coconuts, snow, moss, hay, and leaves to name a few. The majority of Americans, right now, use toilet paper. And my goodness do we use a lot of it! Each American (that includes you!) produces 50 lbs of toilet paper waste each year. It takes 37 gallons of water, 1.3 KWh of electricity, and 1.5 pounds of wood to make a single roll of toilet paper! Americans use about 36.5 billion rolls of toilet paper every year which requires the pulping of about 15 million trees, 473,587,500,000 gallons of water, and 253,000 tons of chlorine for bleaching!  </p>

<p>TUSHY is a female led startup that is looking to do some good. Our team is lead by Miki (founder extraordinaire!), Emmy, and MJ. Based in Brooklyn, New York, TUSHY is doing this campaign in order to make our manufacturing deadline and to spread the word. In order to keep manufacturing in the US we need to make our minimum of $20,000 before June 15th. Making it past this hurdle will allow us to keep our manufacturing, build our team, and begin our partnership with Toilet Hackers. Following this mark, 5% of each TUSHY purchase will go toward bringing toilets to areas of the world without plumbing.</p>
<br/><p>Your support will be the catalyst for our startup to keep moving forward. We want to stay in the US! We want to decrease waste! And you can help us do it. Why? Because all of you deserves to be clean. Let's save money (less toilet paper = less green= more serene), let's save trees  (less green= more serene), and let's change culture.</p>

<blockquote>""Before becoming a part of TUSHY, I didn't know a lot about bidets. So I decided to do some research. I found out that not only are bidets better from a hygienic standpoint, but I also saw a lot of opportunities for good. Yes, we can make the environment better but I'm also concerned with other ways to make a difference. During my research, I read a testimony from a person whose spouse was diagnosed with ALS. Following the installation of a bidet attachment, her spouse was able to gain back some independence that he had not had for a while. It's a simple act, going to the restroom, but for some it's way more than that. Our partnership with Toilet Hackers is another example of how TUSHY can be a part of something extraordinary. As an American, I understand that I live a privileged life. We have toilets. So being able to help an elderly lady feel young for a second, a mom have less of burden doing laundry with her sons, or something as grand as bringing toilets to an area that didn't have the means is a cause I am happy to be a part of. I'm a strong believer in the purpose driven life and I give my time when a difference can be made (big or small) and TUSHY has the potential to make some noise. And I'm happy to help bring the sound to as many as I possibly can. I have a holistic approach to life and finding the harmony in all areas is a constant goal. So why TUSHY? Because all of you and me and everyone deserves to be clean.""  xxMJ</blockquote>

Did you know that every single person on this planet poops? Yes, you know. Well, did you know that most Americans are doing it completely wrong? Yes, wrong! Well, the time has come to say ""No more!"" Let's get clean, let's change culture, and let's help our world and our environment.

Introducing: TUSHY, a modern bidet attachment that turns your average toilet into a tushy-cleaning, personal hygiene wonderland!So, you're probably asking: ""A bidet? Isn't that those fancy things in Europe that look like toilets but aren't actually toilets?""No! Well, sort of yes. TUSHY is a simple to install attachment that connects to your existing toilet and water supply and runs without the use of electricity! 
   




Since the dawn of time, humans have found creative ways to clean up after pooping: coconuts, snow, moss, hay, and leaves to name a few. The majority of Americans, right now, use toilet paper. And my goodness do we use a lot of it! Each American (that includes you!) produces 50 lbs of toilet paper waste each year. It takes 37 gallons of water, 1.3 KWh of electricity, and 1.5 pounds of wood to make a single roll of toilet paper! Americans use about 36.5 billion rolls of toilet paper every year which requires the pulping of about 15 million trees, 473,587,500,000 gallons of water, and 253,000 tons of chlorine for bleaching!  
Installing Your Tushy
   


Well let’s say no more! Let’s shed that weight! Let’s save some trees! Let’s save some green. Are you ready? Let’s change culture together. 













What Do We Need?
TUSHY is a female led startup that is looking to do some good. Our team is lead by Miki (founder extraordinaire!), Emmy, and MJ. Based in Brooklyn, New York, TUSHY is doing this campaign in order to make our manufacturing deadline and to spread the word. In order to keep manufacturing in the US we need to make our minimum of $20,000 before June 15th. Making it past this hurdle will allow us to keep our manufacturing, build our team, and begin our partnership with Toilet Hackers. Following this mark, 5% of each TUSHY purchase will go toward bringing toilets to areas of the world without plumbing.
Your support will be the catalyst for our startup to keep moving forward. We want to stay in the US! We want to decrease waste! And you can help us do it. Why? Because all of you deserves to be clean. Let's save money (less toilet paper = less green= more serene), let's save trees  (less green= more serene), and let's change culture.
Why Are We Doing This?



Miki Agrawal, Founder
""I am half-Japanese and I grew up knowing about bidets my whole life and dreaming of having my own one day. I finally got a bidet attachment 4 years ago as a Valentine's Day present (he knew of my obsession with bidets, what a guy!)  and it transformed my entire bathroom experience. A once messy, wasteful, time consuming, not so clean experience was replaced with a precise, short burst of refreshing water that gave me peace of mind and a clean feeling that I had never felt before. 


I also realized how wasteful producing a single role of toilet paper was. 37 gallons of water and bleach to produce one single roll!? What!? I couldn't believe that Americans go through 57 sheets of toilet paper per day! -Versus using a single pint of water for every time you use a bidet sounded way more environmental too! 


The final reason why I am passionate about this project is because not only am I half-Japanese but I am half-Indian too (Dad is from India)! I have been to India many times, to Africa three times and discovered the huge sanitation crisis around the world. 40% of the world doesn't have proper sanitation nor a place to go to the bathroom. We're talking about human beings. So, by partnering with Toilet Hackers, I feel like we are taking part in a real solution for our fellow earthlings around the world.""





                                                                                                           
                                                                     MJ Batson, TUSHY Extraordinaire! & Co-Owner

""Before becoming a part of TUSHY, I didn't know a lot about bidets. So I decided to do some research. I found out that not only are bidets better from a hygienic standpoint, but I also saw a lot of opportunities for good. Yes, we can make the environment better but I'm also concerned with other ways to make a difference. During my research, I read a testimony from a person whose spouse was diagnosed with ALS. Following the installation of a bidet attachment, her spouse was able to gain back some independence that he had not had for a while. It's a simple act, going to the restroom, but for some it's way more than that. Our partnership with Toilet Hackers is another example of how TUSHY can be a part of something extraordinary. As an American, I understand that I live a privileged life. We have toilets. So being able to help an elderly lady feel young for a second, a mom have less of burden doing laundry with her sons, or something as grand as bringing toilets to an area that didn't have the means is a cause I am happy to be a part of. I'm a strong believer in the purpose driven life and I give my time when a difference can be made (big or small) and TUSHY has the potential to make some noise. And I'm happy to help bring the sound to as many as I possibly can. I have a holistic approach to life and finding the harmony in all areas is a constant goal. So why TUSHY? Because all of you and me and everyone deserves to be clean.""  xxMJ




Emmy Bush, TUSHY Extraordinaire! & Co-Owner

""The aspect of TUSHY I was drawn to was the eco-conscious side.  Ever since I was little my family recycled, carried reusable grocery bags, composted, and rejected plastic water bottles, just to name a few.  So TUSHY for me was another thing I could do on a daily basis to make a difference.  27,000 trees are cut down daily just to make toilet paper!  That number is alarming to me.  The consumption of toilet paper in America is alarming to me, and I want to change that.""

<p>Ce qui fait l’originalité d’iCRAME, c’est avant tout l’association unique d’un réseau d’entraide communautaire de proximité - fédéré autour d’une Application mobile - et de matériels de vidéo surveillance performant livré et paramétré chez vous ou dans votre entreprise par nos techniciens. 
Cette approche qui allie lien social et technologie permet de mettre en relation les membres de la communauté afin de lever un doute et d’assister les membres de la communauté en cas d’intrusion, de dégâts matériels ou d’atteinte à la personne, dans vos locaux professionnels ou dans votre habitation.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435324697/gfyobzie4yb04hhdsgsb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>Reposant sur la notion de communauté, iCRAME fédère les particuliers et professionnels qui ne veulent pas se contenter d’être simplement alertés par une société de télésurveillance en cas d’intrusion ou de dégâts matériels et qui, au contraire, souhaitent disposer d’une assistance sur place, le tout sans coût caché et en toute confiance.

</p>
<p>Grâce à iCRAME et son réseau local d’entraide, les membres de la communauté peuvent, très rapidement, lever le doute (s’il n’existe aucun risque) ou être assistés en cas de réel problème, en particulier lorsqu’ils sont éloignés de leur domicile, de leur résidence de vacances ou de leurs locaux professionnels.</p>
<p><br/>Les membres de la communauté sont en contact direct via l’App mobile iCRAME et s’assistent pour valider et accélérer :<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>L’intervention des forces de l’ordre</li>
<li>Attendre le serrurier</li>
<li>Vérifier s’il y a des dégâts après un orage ou une fuite d’eau<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Le tout en toute confiance grâce aux caméras dont sont équipés tous les membres de la communauté iCRAME, un outil indispensable qui permet de valider le bien-fondé d’une intervention.</p>

<h2>Comment ça marche ?<br/>
</h2>
<p>Chaque membre de la communauté  (ou iCRAMeur) s’équipe d’au moins une caméra - gage de sa bonne foi et pierre angulaire de la confiance entre membres de la communauté – et télécharge l’App Mobile ICRAME sur laquelle il s’inscrit afin d’adhérer à la communauté.</p>
<p>Malheureusement cela vous est arrivé ! Vous avez été
cambriolé alors que vous n’étiez pas à votre domicile… Votre caméra iCRAME vous
a alerté mais que faire ?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435331720/mrrz78lvptevfsr0tvqv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>En cas d’intrusion, de dégâts matériels ou d’atteinte à la personne, le membre de la communauté est alerté sur son smartphone de la situation et vérifie le bien-fondé d’une intervention, grâce à la caméra de télésurveillance.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435324594/fyy0gexaxmupcuzgh5wz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Il géolocalise ensuite, toujours grâce à son application mobile, les membres de la communauté qui sont disponibles pour intervenir sur site. Après avoir validé avec un « Helpeur » (personne qui intervient pour aider un membre de la communauté) qu’il peut intervenir, il lui explique comment intervenir puis est tenu informé en temps réel de la situation.</p>
<p>À partir de l'application, le Helpeur peut commencer son rapport en suivant une shake list en fonction de l'intervention, en y ajoutant les photos à l'appui. Ce rapport pourra être utilisé pour compléter la déclaration à l'assurance et aussi pour le dépôt de plainte. <br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435324614/x0b8tskfpwvqgnt2teug.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Une fois l’intervention terminée, le « Demandeur » (personne qui fait appel à un membre de la communauté) remercie le Helpeur en lui offrant des crédits cadeaux, qu'il pourra utiliser sur les sites de nos partenaires affiliés. <br/></p>
<br/>
<h4>Prenons un exemple :</h4>
<b>David reçoit une alerte lui signalant une intrusion dans son commerce alors qu’il est en vacances à 300 kms de là.</b><br/><br/>&gt; David commence par vérifier, grâce à la caméra de surveillance, qu’il y a bien eu intrusion. Il cherche via l’application mobile, un Helpeur disponible pour attendre la police<br/>
<br/>&gt; Véronique est disponible.<br/><br/>

&gt; Il la
contacte et lui donne toutes les instructions.<br/><br/>


&gt; Véronique se rend sur place et attend l’arrivée des forces de l’ordre qui ont été contactés par David ou/et Véronique. Elle est présente pour les assister dans leur travail et rendre compte, en temps réel, à David de la situation avec des photos à l’appui.


<br/><br/>David très satisfait de l’aide de Véronique lui offre un cadeau via l’application iCRAME.

<h2>Pourquoi iCRAME ?</h2>
<p>La télésurveillance est devenue un outil de plus en plus utilisé par les particuliers comme par les professionnels pour assurer la surveillance des habitations et locaux commerciaux.</p>
<p>Bien que le principe soit séduisant sur le papier, dans les faits, le déplacement des entreprises de sécurité sur place est souvent plus complexe à mettre en œuvre et le traitement en lui-même du problème rencontré, n’est que rarement pris en charge par la société de sécurité (ou moyennant des frais importants et souvent cachés).</p>
<p>Grâce à iCRAME et son réseau solidaire, les membres de la communauté sont sûrs d’avoir un relais local de confiance pour assister les professionnels (tout en étant en relation avec le Demandeur) qui devront intervenir dans l’habitation ou le local commercial.</p>
<p>L’iCRAMeur peut ainsi avoir l’assurance que quelqu’un peut lui rendre compte, en temps réel, de ce qui se passe, et surtout permettre de réduire les temps d’intervention des équipes de professionnels (préalablement référencés) 
</p>

<h2>Pour qui ?</h2>
<p>iCRAME est une solution qui s’adresse aux particuliers comme aux professionnels qui souhaitent bénéficier de la puissance des technologies de vidéo surveillance  tout en s’assurant qu’une personne de confiance peut sur place, les aider à accélérer les démarches et les interventions des professionnels (serruriers, pompiers, forces de police, etc.).</p>
<p>Cela concerne aussi bien les résidences principales que les résidences de vacances ou encore les locaux professionnels.

<h1>Le projet<br/>
</h1>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(233, 146, 57);""><br/>Juin 2014, suite à de nombreuses alarmes dans nos locaux et le plus souvent intempestives, nous devions, pour lever le doute, nous déplacer systématiquement et faire 15 kms aller/retour à chaque alerte. C’est à ce moment que l’idée d’un réseau social de proximité associé à des caméras de vidéosurveillance prit forme.</span>
</p>
<span style=""color: rgb(233, 146, 57);"">En août 2014,  nos locaux sont fermés durant les congés et nous recevons une alerte nous signalant un problème dans nos locaux. Nous constatons, grâce à nos caméras, une fuite d’eau, mais impossible d’intervenir rapidement.</span>
<br/><br/>Nous devions faire rapidement intervenir quelqu’un mais que ce soit le plombier ou le serrurier, il fallait une personne qui soit physiquement présente pour l’accueillir.  Appeler les pompiers risquait de laisser nos locaux non sécurisés après leur départ.
Heureusement, un de nos amis a pu intervenir 3 heures après que l’alerte a été donnée.
<br/>
La création d’iCRAME était alors évidente : pourquoi ne pas constituer un réseau d’entraide communauté de proximité, qui permettrait d’être assisté en cas d’intrusion ou de dégâts lorsque l’on est absent de chez soi ou de ses locaux professionnels. 
<br/>
En équipant les membres du réseau avec des caméras, nous avions l’assurance de ne pas les faire se déplacer pour rien grâce à la télésurveillance. La technologie et les applications mobiles ont fait le reste, nous avions déjà une bonne connaissance du marché du matériel de télésurveillance.
<br/>
<br/><br/>Il ne restait qu’à coupler un très bon matériel avec une application sociale simple et efficace.


<br/><br/><p><span style=""color: rgb(233, 146, 57);"">De septembre 2014 à décembre 2014, nous développons notre concept et commençons à tester l’idée autour de nous</span></p>

<h2>What is iCRAME?</h2>
<br/>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A unique combination combining a local community mutual aid network and highly efficient connected video monitoring equipment.</span></p>

What makes ’iCRAME so original is that it is first and foremost the unique combination of a local community mutual aid network (united through a mobile Apps) and efficient remote monitoring equipment delivered to and configured at your home or company by our technicians. 
This approach combining a social link with technology puts members of the community in contact with each other, in order to assuage any doubts and assist other members in the event of an intrusion, physical damage or harm to an individual, at your professional premises or your home.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436361504/f8j59owagwqh0ewx3gmt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>


Based on the idea of community, iCRAME brings together private individuals and professionals who want more than mere alerts sent by a remote monitoring firm in the event of an intrusion or physical damage, and seek actual assistance on site – all with no hidden costs and the assurance of total trust.
Thanks to iCRAME and its local mutual aid network, members of the community can rapidly set their minds at rest (if no risk exists) or receive assistance if there is a real problem, particularly when they are far from their home, holiday home or professional premises.<br/></p><br/>


The members of the community are in direct contact via the iCRAME mobile App and can help each other out:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>confirming and speeding up the intervention of the police</li>
<li>waiting for a locksmith</li>
<li>checking if any damage has occurred after a storm<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>

The whole system is reliable, thanks to the cameras that all members of the iCRAME community are equipped with: an essential tool that makes it possible to confirm whether action is necessary.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432141041/b2gyga25jizlykwkwudp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>How does it work?<br/>
</h2>
Each member of the community (or iCRAMer) acquires at least one camera – a gauge of their good faith, and the cornerstone of trust between the community members – and downloads the ICRAME Mobile App, which they obtain in order to join the community.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435331720/mrrz78lvptevfsr0tvqv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

In the event of intrusion, physical damage or harm to an individual, the community member receives an alert about the situation on their smartphone and checks whether action is needed, thanks to the remote monitoring camera.<br/><br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435324594/fyy0gexaxmupcuzgh5wz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Still using their mobile app, he or she then geolocates community members available to take action on site. After checking with a ""Helper""(a person who helps another member) that they can take action, the member explains what to do, and is then kept informed of the situation in real time.</p><p>From the application the Helper can start the report following a shake list according to the procedure by adding photos to support. This report will be able to be used to complete the statement to the insurance and also for filing a complaint.<br/></p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435324614/x0b8tskfpwvqgnt2teug.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Once the action has been completed, the ""Applicant"" (the person who calls on a community member) thank the Helpeur by offering him gifts credit that it can use on our affiliate partners web sites.<br/><br/><h4>For example: </h4>
<b>David receives an alert about a break-in at his shop while he is on holiday 300 km away.</b><br/><br/>&gt; David starts out by checking that there really has been a break-in by means of the surveillance camera.Then, using the mobile app, he seeks out an available Helper to wait for the police.
<br/><br/>&gt; Véronique is available.
<br/><br/>&gt; He contacts her and gives her comprehensive instructions.<br/><br/> &gt; Véronique goes to the shop and waits for the police, who have been contacted by David and/or Véronique. She is present to help them in their work, and reports back to David in real time with photos to illustrate what is happening.<br/><br/>David is very satisfied with Véronique's help, and gives her a gift via the iCRAME app.<br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432141041/b2gyga25jizlykwkwudp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Why iCRAME?</h2>
<p>Remote monitoring has become a tool increasingly used by both private individuals and professionals to carry out remote surveillance on homes and commercial premises.</p>
<p>Although the principle looks attractive on paper, when it comes to the practical side, it is sometimes complex for security firms to travel to a site, and the actual problem is only rarely dealt with by the security firm itself (or only at considerable cost, which is often hidden). </p>
<p>Thanks to iCRAME and its mutual assistance network, the members of the community are certain to have a local, trustworthy contact person to assist the professionals (while keeping in touch with the Applicant) who need to take action at the house or commercial premises.</p>
<p>iCRAMers thus have the assurance that someone can report to them in real time about what is going on, and above all make it possible to shorten the intervention period of professional teams (who have been previously approved). 
</p><br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432141041/b2gyga25jizlykwkwudp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Who is iCRAME intended for?</h2>
<p>iCRAME is a solution designed for private individuals and professionals alike, who wish to make use of powerful video monitoring technologies while ensuring that someone trustworthy is present on site, who can help to speed up procedures and interventions by professionals (locksmiths, firemen, police, etc.).</p>
<p>This applies to principal homes, holiday residences and professional premises alike.</p><br/>

Welcome to our new International partners. Be part of this amazing iCRAME new security services in your country.

 

iCRAME
Qu’est-ce que c’est ?

Une association unique entre un réseau d’entraide communautaire de proximité et des équipements de vidéosurveillance performants et connectés.
Ce qui fait l’originalité d’iCRAME, c’est avant tout l’association unique d’un réseau d’entraide communautaire de proximité - fédéré autour d’une Application mobile - et de matériels de vidéo surveillance performant livré et paramétré chez vous ou dans votre entreprise par nos techniciens. 
Cette approche qui allie lien social et technologie permet de mettre en relation les membres de la communauté afin de lever un doute et d’assister les membres de la communauté en cas d’intrusion, de dégâts matériels ou d’atteinte à la personne, dans vos locaux professionnels ou dans votre habitation.
Reposant sur la notion de communauté, iCRAME fédère les particuliers et professionnels qui ne veulent pas se contenter d’être simplement alertés par une société de télésurveillance en cas d’intrusion ou de dégâts matériels et qui, au contraire, souhaitent disposer d’une assistance sur place, le tout sans coût caché et en toute confiance.


Grâce à iCRAME et son réseau local d’entraide, les membres de la communauté peuvent, très rapidement, lever le doute (s’il n’existe aucun risque) ou être assistés en cas de réel problème, en particulier lorsqu’ils sont éloignés de leur domicile, de leur résidence de vacances ou de leurs locaux professionnels.
Les membres de la communauté sont en contact direct via l’App mobile iCRAME et s’assistent pour valider et accélérer :

L’intervention des forces de l’ordre
Attendre le serrurier
Vérifier s’il y a des dégâts après un orage ou une fuite d’eau


Le tout en toute confiance grâce aux caméras dont sont équipés tous les membres de la communauté iCRAME, un outil indispensable qui permet de valider le bien-fondé d’une intervention.

Comment ça marche ?

Chaque membre de la communauté  (ou iCRAMeur) s’équipe d’au moins une caméra - gage de sa bonne foi et pierre angulaire de la confiance entre membres de la communauté – et télécharge l’App Mobile ICRAME sur laquelle il s’inscrit afin d’adhérer à la communauté.
Malheureusement cela vous est arrivé ! Vous avez été
cambriolé alors que vous n’étiez pas à votre domicile… Votre caméra iCRAME vous
a alerté mais que faire ?


En cas d’intrusion, de dégâts matériels ou d’atteinte à la personne, le membre de la communauté est alerté sur son smartphone de la situation et vérifie le bien-fondé d’une intervention, grâce à la caméra de télésurveillance.


Il géolocalise ensuite, toujours grâce à son application mobile, les membres de la communauté qui sont disponibles pour intervenir sur site. Après avoir validé avec un « Helpeur » (personne qui intervient pour aider un membre de la communauté) qu’il peut intervenir, il lui explique comment intervenir puis est tenu informé en temps réel de la situation.
À partir de l'application, le Helpeur peut commencer son rapport en suivant une shake list en fonction de l'intervention, en y ajoutant les photos à l'appui. Ce rapport pourra être utilisé pour compléter la déclaration à l'assurance et aussi pour le dépôt de plainte. 

Une fois l’intervention terminée, le « Demandeur » (personne qui fait appel à un membre de la communauté) remercie le Helpeur en lui offrant des crédits cadeaux, qu'il pourra utiliser sur les sites de nos partenaires affiliés. 

Prenons un exemple :
David reçoit une alerte lui signalant une intrusion dans son commerce alors qu’il est en vacances à 300 kms de là.> David commence par vérifier, grâce à la caméra de surveillance, qu’il y a bien eu intrusion. Il cherche via l’application mobile, un Helpeur disponible pour attendre la police
> Véronique est disponible.

> Il la
contacte et lui donne toutes les instructions.


> Véronique se rend sur place et attend l’arrivée des forces de l’ordre qui ont été contactés par David ou/et Véronique. Elle est présente pour les assister dans leur travail et rendre compte, en temps réel, à David de la situation avec des photos à l’appui.


David très satisfait de l’aide de Véronique lui offre un cadeau via l’application iCRAME.



Pourquoi iCRAME ?
La télésurveillance est devenue un outil de plus en plus utilisé par les particuliers comme par les professionnels pour assurer la surveillance des habitations et locaux commerciaux.
Bien que le principe soit séduisant sur le papier, dans les faits, le déplacement des entreprises de sécurité sur place est souvent plus complexe à mettre en œuvre et le traitement en lui-même du problème rencontré, n’est que rarement pris en charge par la société de sécurité (ou moyennant des frais importants et souvent cachés).
Grâce à iCRAME et son réseau solidaire, les membres de la communauté sont sûrs d’avoir un relais local de confiance pour assister les professionnels (tout en étant en relation avec le Demandeur) qui devront intervenir dans l’habitation ou le local commercial.
L’iCRAMeur peut ainsi avoir l’assurance que quelqu’un peut lui rendre compte, en temps réel, de ce qui se passe, et surtout permettre de réduire les temps d’intervention des équipes de professionnels (préalablement référencés) 


Pour qui ?
iCRAME est une solution qui s’adresse aux particuliers comme aux professionnels qui souhaitent bénéficier de la puissance des technologies de vidéo surveillance  tout en s’assurant qu’une personne de confiance peut sur place, les aider à accélérer les démarches et les interventions des professionnels (serruriers, pompiers, forces de police, etc.).
Cela concerne aussi bien les résidences principales que les résidences de vacances ou encore les locaux professionnels.

Le projet

Juin 2014, suite à de nombreuses alarmes dans nos locaux et le plus souvent intempestives, nous devions, pour lever le doute, nous déplacer systématiquement et faire 15 kms aller/retour à chaque alerte. C’est à ce moment que l’idée d’un réseau social de proximité associé à des caméras de vidéosurveillance prit forme.

En août 2014,  nos locaux sont fermés durant les congés et nous recevons une alerte nous signalant un problème dans nos locaux. Nous constatons, grâce à nos caméras, une fuite d’eau, mais impossible d’intervenir rapidement.
Nous devions faire rapidement intervenir quelqu’un mais que ce soit le plombier ou le serrurier, il fallait une personne qui soit physiquement présente pour l’accueillir.  Appeler les pompiers risquait de laisser nos locaux non sécurisés après leur départ.
Heureusement, un de nos amis a pu intervenir 3 heures après que l’alerte a été donnée.

La création d’iCRAME était alors évidente : pourquoi ne pas constituer un réseau d’entraide communauté de proximité, qui permettrait d’être assisté en cas d’intrusion ou de dégâts lorsque l’on est absent de chez soi ou de ses locaux professionnels. 

En équipant les membres du réseau avec des caméras, nous avions l’assurance de ne pas les faire se déplacer pour rien grâce à la télésurveillance. La technologie et les applications mobiles ont fait le reste, nous avions déjà une bonne connaissance du marché du matériel de télésurveillance.

Il ne restait qu’à coupler un très bon matériel avec une application sociale simple et efficace.


De septembre 2014 à décembre 2014, nous développons notre concept et commençons à tester l’idée autour de nous




Juin/Juillet
2015, nous lançons notre produit via la plate-forme de financement participatif
Indiegogo afin de tester l’impact de notre offre et enregistrer les premières
commandes. 

Nous serons en mesure de livrer les premières précommandes
et lancer le début de la communauté active dès Octobre 2015. Au fur et à mesure des
commentaires de nos contributeurs, nous
implémenterons de nouvelles fonctionnalités dans l’application iCRAME.




Pourquoi le financement participatif ?



Nous croyons fortement dans notre concept et nous
souhaitons, grâce à votre soutien, analyser rapidement l’impact et la
pertinence de notre solution iCRAME tout en démarrant rapidement la mise en
place du réseau communautaire.


En effet, il est important pour nous de fédérer dès
maintenant une communauté solidaire autour de ce projet via la plate-forme
IndieGoGo, car travailler directement avec vous nous permettra également
d’améliorer notre solution et d’en faire un outil incontournable.

Comment nous aider ?

What is iCRAME?

A unique combination combining a local community mutual aid network and highly efficient connected video monitoring equipment.

What makes ’iCRAME so original is that it is first and foremost the unique combination of a local community mutual aid network (united through a mobile Apps) and efficient remote monitoring equipment delivered to and configured at your home or company by our technicians. 
This approach combining a social link with technology puts members of the community in contact with each other, in order to assuage any doubts and assist other members in the event of an intrusion, physical damage or harm to an individual, at your professional premises or your home.


Based on the idea of community, iCRAME brings together private individuals and professionals who want more than mere alerts sent by a remote monitoring firm in the event of an intrusion or physical damage, and seek actual assistance on site – all with no hidden costs and the assurance of total trust.
Thanks to iCRAME and its local mutual aid network, members of the community can rapidly set their minds at rest (if no risk exists) or receive assistance if there is a real problem, particularly when they are far from their home, holiday home or professional premises.


The members of the community are in direct contact via the iCRAME mobile App and can help each other out:
confirming and speeding up the intervention of the police
waiting for a locksmith
checking if any damage has occurred after a storm



The whole system is reliable, thanks to the cameras that all members of the iCRAME community are equipped with: an essential tool that makes it possible to confirm whether action is necessary.
How does it work?

Each member of the community (or iCRAMer) acquires at least one camera – a gauge of their good faith, and the cornerstone of trust between the community members – and downloads the ICRAME Mobile App, which they obtain in order to join the community.

In the event of intrusion, physical damage or harm to an individual, the community member receives an alert about the situation on their smartphone and checks whether action is needed, thanks to the remote monitoring camera.
Still using their mobile app, he or she then geolocates community members available to take action on site. After checking with a ""Helper""(a person who helps another member) that they can take action, the member explains what to do, and is then kept informed of the situation in real time.From the application the Helper can start the report following a shake list according to the procedure by adding photos to support. This report will be able to be used to complete the statement to the insurance and also for filing a complaint.
Once the action has been completed, the ""Applicant"" (the person who calls on a community member) thank the Helpeur by offering him gifts credit that it can use on our affiliate partners web sites.For example: 
David receives an alert about a break-in at his shop while he is on holiday 300 km away.> David starts out by checking that there really has been a break-in by means of the surveillance camera.Then, using the mobile app, he seeks out an available Helper to wait for the police.
> Véronique is available.
> He contacts her and gives her comprehensive instructions. > Véronique goes to the shop and waits for the police, who have been contacted by David and/or Véronique. She is present to help them in their work, and reports back to David in real time with photos to illustrate what is happening.David is very satisfied with Véronique's help, and gives her a gift via the iCRAME app.

Why iCRAME?
Remote monitoring has become a tool increasingly used by both private individuals and professionals to carry out remote surveillance on homes and commercial premises.
Although the principle looks attractive on paper, when it comes to the practical side, it is sometimes complex for security firms to travel to a site, and the actual problem is only rarely dealt with by the security firm itself (or only at considerable cost, which is often hidden). 
Thanks to iCRAME and its mutual assistance network, the members of the community are certain to have a local, trustworthy contact person to assist the professionals (while keeping in touch with the Applicant) who need to take action at the house or commercial premises.
iCRAMers thus have the assurance that someone can report to them in real time about what is going on, and above all make it possible to shorten the intervention period of professional teams (who have been previously approved). 


Who is iCRAME intended for?
iCRAME is a solution designed for private individuals and professionals alike, who wish to make use of powerful video monitoring technologies while ensuring that someone trustworthy is present on site, who can help to speed up procedures and interventions by professionals (locksmiths, firemen, police, etc.).
This applies to principal homes, holiday residences and professional premises alike.

What advantages does it bring me?
 iCRAME means essential services 

The icrame offer
The iCRAME offer is based on two inseparable elements which make this approach a reliable, simple and economic solution.





ICRAME App
The platform for putting community members in touchThe iCRAME App is a technical technological platform enabling iCRAMErs to get in touch with and mutually help each other. It puts all the members of the community in contact with each other and geo-locates available Helpers.
The iCRAME App can be downloaded from the Apple and Google Android stores, and is the essential complement to the iCRAME Camera video monitoring equipment. Membership of the iCRAME mutual aid network and the use of the platform are included in the rental contract of the iCRAME camera(s).  


ICRAME Cameras
Technological remote monitoring solutions

iCRAME offers several camera models, which are all far more sophisticated than simple cameras.
The first connected object, the camera not only monitors and obtains images but also makes it possible to exchange (listen and speak), detect individuals and share happy moments at a distance.


All our cameras have the following features:

Simple installation and configuration
Recording of indoor camera images on a 32 GB SD card
Indoor cameras that can be remotely piloted  

An impeccable design 
Different functions and models depending on their use (a professional range and a private individual range, indoor and outdoor models),
Alerts in real time on your smartphone,
Excellent value for money.


Our cameras for private
individuals  




iCRAMers' cameras are on offer at a particularly economical rental rate 
which includes maintenance and standard exchange in the event of a 
breakdown.
Our cameras for
professionals




Associated
services 


Depending
on the formula proposed, we offer our clients:



An
installation and configuration service on site everywhere in France, and shortly
in every country where we have branches.

Shipping and a telephone helpline for iCRAMErs who wish to install the cameras themselves
A maintenance service enabling rapid replacement of equipment in the event of a breakdown




Why crowdfunding?
We believe strongly in our concept and thanks to your support, we wish to rapidly analyse the impact and relevance of our iCRAME solution while starting the rapid set-up of the community network.

This is because it is important for us to federate a mutually beneficial international community around this project via the platform IndieGoGo, because working directly with you will also enable us to improve our solution and make it a truly indispensable tool.

<p>Well I guess the first thing
to explain is why and how we came up with this idea. </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p><p>                                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431774211/ggw19vwmyoxiuuawy6bs.png"" src="""" style=""width: 341.561224489796px; height: 358px;""/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>MIND ∙ BODY ∙ RAW</b> is the brain child of Tony Anderson,
a dynamic, results-driven professional  with over 15 years’ experience in sales,
account management and business development across various sectors.</p>
<p>After a serious knee injury
cut short a promising career in football in his 20s, Tony entered the
recruitment industry where he quickly rose through the ranks to become branch
manager, before turning his attention to business. </p>
<p>While working in recruitment,
Tony had spotted a gap in the market for high-quality gifts aimed at the
corporate market. He decided to set up his own exclusive gift business and began
importing premium organic food and drink products from Europe into the UK. </p>
<p>The business grew quickly.
Tony managed to secure a preferred supplier contract with British Airways
(First Class), and built up an extensive portfolio of corporate and retail
accounts with key clients such as Virgin Airlines, Waitrose and over 300
independent health food shops around the country.</p>
<p>In the first year of trading,
Tony won first prize and was highly commended in the prestigious Organic Food
Awards, presented by HRH The Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>As a former sports
professional, Tony has always been passionate about organic food, health and
wellness, and understands the importance of good nutrition. So when various
food allergies forced him to cut out many of his favourite foods Tony turned to
his partner, a vegetarian and keen advocate of yoga and natural nutrition for
advice. </p>
<p>This led Tony on a journey to
eating less meat and more raw plant-based wholefoods. Within weeks, many of his
ailments vanished. </p>
<p>Tony tried to find healthy
snacks to supplement his diet but to his dismay found that many of the snacks
and cereal bars on the market that claimed to be healthy were actually far from
it. Others were made up of just one or two wholefood ingredients and tasted too
sweet, same-y or plain weird.</p>
<p>Out of frustration, Tony started
making his own snack bars at home that he could take to work or to the gym. He
used only raw, natural wholefoods and tested and tweaked his recipe until he
found the right balance of wholesome ingredients that were satisfying,
nutritious and tasted great. He shared his <b>Raw
Wholefood Snack Bars</b> with family, friends and colleagues, and was
amazed by their response. </p>
<p><b></b></p><p>                             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431772379/mvy8hgvzjqxo872ephsq.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 386px; height: 386px;""/></p><p><b>“Let
food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food” ~ Hippocrates</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>On their urging, Tony decided
to set up a new business venture and
inspired by the Hippocrates quote above, called it<b> MIND ∙ BODY ∙ RAW</b>.  </p>
<p>Tony is committed to making his
bars more widely available to other health and wellness enthusiasts across the
UK. He has completed extensive research into the market and looked at all the
current trends, competitors and market potential.  </p>
<p>The wholefood bars produced
by<b> MIND ∙ BODY ∙ RAW</b> have been
developed from Tony's own handcrafted recipe and use only raw wholefoods and natural
ingredients. </p>
<p>We believe they are the best <b>Raw Wholefood Snack Bars</b> on the market.
But it’s not just us. Everyone who has tried our bars has said the same thing!</p>
<p>As you can see, we have
always been interested in eating well and living a healthy lifestyle, but had
no idea how much of an impact raw food could have on our diet and our lives.
You see we didn’t plan to start a raw wholefood business based on eating well,
clean and healthy, but somehow that’s exactly what happened.</p><p>This campaign has been put
together to raise funds for the development of the <b>MIND ∙ BODY ∙ RAW</b> brand and product range including our <b>Raw Wholefood Snack Bars</b>. </p>
<p>We have come up with a great
range of products that provide all of the nutrient-dense qualities of raw food
in a convenient modern day format - the snack bar - making it quick and easy
for our customers to eat healthy. </p>
<p>By supporting this
Crowdfunding campaign you will be helping us to develop our range of products,
promote and market them and introduce a great range of truly healthy convenient
<b>Raw Wholefood Snack Bars </b>to everyone
in the UK.</p>

<p>Perhaps you've heard the term
""raw food"" already or maybe you've only just come across it, but are
not sure what it means exactly. </p>
<p>A raw food vegan diet
consists of unprocessed plant-based ideally organic wholefoods such as fruits,
vegetables, nuts, seeds, and grains that are eaten cold or a little warm, as
long as the temperature doesn't go above 46 degrees. </p>
<p>This temperature is generally
accepted as the cut-off point beyond which vital nutrients and natural enzymes
are destroyed by the cooking process. That’s why raw foods are also referred to
as live or “living” foods.</p>
<p></p><p>                               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431772560/xk2xoxahqdzx7debumll.png"" src="""" style=""width: 359px; height: 359px;""/></p><p>Our bodies need the enzymes
found in these raw “living” foods because they aid digestion, help fight
chronic disease like arthritis and diabetes, clear up headaches and allergies,
improve your immunity and enhance your memory and ability to concentrate. </p>
<p>Since wholefoods are all
naturally high in vitamins, minerals, fibre, and phytochemicals that are not
zapped by heat, eating a wide variety of such foods on a regular basis can boost
energy, increase the body’s ability to remove toxins, help burn calories,
improve your complexion and assist with weight loss. </p>
<p>We all know that eating lots
of fruit and vegetables is good for us but who has the time to shop, cut and
prep wholefoods every day? While a full raw diet is not suitable or practical
for everyone, we believe that each one of us can benefit by introducing more
raw wholefoods into our daily diet. </p>
<p>And one of the easiest ways
to do this is through our healthy <b>Raw
Wholefood Snack Bars</b>.</p>
<p>Research and studies have
shown that people are finally ready to embrace a healthy, raw, organic clean
food lifestyle. This is not a fad or a diet, but a way of consuming food that
serves the body well and keeps it healthy, strong and in balance. </p>

MIND ∙ BODY ∙ RAW brings you Raw Wholefood Snack
Bars just as nature intended but in a healthy, easy and convenient form for
modern living. 
From the careful selection of
the ingredients to the precise blending of the wholefoods, our aim is to bring
you healthy, handcrafted products that taste great and do not require any of
the prepping and chopping associated with raw diets.
   

About This Campaign
Well I guess the first thing
to explain is why and how we came up with this idea. 
                                  MIND ∙ BODY ∙ RAW is the brain child of Tony Anderson,
a dynamic, results-driven professional  with over 15 years’ experience in sales,
account management and business development across various sectors.
After a serious knee injury
cut short a promising career in football in his 20s, Tony entered the
recruitment industry where he quickly rose through the ranks to become branch
manager, before turning his attention to business. 
While working in recruitment,
Tony had spotted a gap in the market for high-quality gifts aimed at the
corporate market. He decided to set up his own exclusive gift business and began
importing premium organic food and drink products from Europe into the UK. 
The business grew quickly.
Tony managed to secure a preferred supplier contract with British Airways
(First Class), and built up an extensive portfolio of corporate and retail
accounts with key clients such as Virgin Airlines, Waitrose and over 300
independent health food shops around the country.
In the first year of trading,
Tony won first prize and was highly commended in the prestigious Organic Food
Awards, presented by HRH The Prince of Wales.
As a former sports
professional, Tony has always been passionate about organic food, health and
wellness, and understands the importance of good nutrition. So when various
food allergies forced him to cut out many of his favourite foods Tony turned to
his partner, a vegetarian and keen advocate of yoga and natural nutrition for
advice. 
This led Tony on a journey to
eating less meat and more raw plant-based wholefoods. Within weeks, many of his
ailments vanished. 
Tony tried to find healthy
snacks to supplement his diet but to his dismay found that many of the snacks
and cereal bars on the market that claimed to be healthy were actually far from
it. Others were made up of just one or two wholefood ingredients and tasted too
sweet, same-y or plain weird.
Out of frustration, Tony started
making his own snack bars at home that he could take to work or to the gym. He
used only raw, natural wholefoods and tested and tweaked his recipe until he
found the right balance of wholesome ingredients that were satisfying,
nutritious and tasted great. He shared his Raw
Wholefood Snack Bars with family, friends and colleagues, and was
amazed by their response. 
                             “Let
food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food” ~ Hippocrates

On their urging, Tony decided
to set up a new business venture and
inspired by the Hippocrates quote above, called it MIND ∙ BODY ∙ RAW.  
Tony is committed to making his
bars more widely available to other health and wellness enthusiasts across the
UK. He has completed extensive research into the market and looked at all the
current trends, competitors and market potential.  
The wholefood bars produced
by MIND ∙ BODY ∙ RAW have been
developed from Tony's own handcrafted recipe and use only raw wholefoods and natural
ingredients. 
We believe they are the best Raw Wholefood Snack Bars on the market.
But it’s not just us. Everyone who has tried our bars has said the same thing!
As you can see, we have
always been interested in eating well and living a healthy lifestyle, but had
no idea how much of an impact raw food could have on our diet and our lives.
You see we didn’t plan to start a raw wholefood business based on eating well,
clean and healthy, but somehow that’s exactly what happened.This campaign has been put
together to raise funds for the development of the MIND ∙ BODY ∙ RAW brand and product range including our Raw Wholefood Snack Bars. 
We have come up with a great
range of products that provide all of the nutrient-dense qualities of raw food
in a convenient modern day format - the snack bar - making it quick and easy
for our customers to eat healthy. 
By supporting this
Crowdfunding campaign you will be helping us to develop our range of products,
promote and market them and introduce a great range of truly healthy convenient
Raw Wholefood Snack Bars to everyone
in the UK.
A Little Bit About RAW Food:
Perhaps you've heard the term
""raw food"" already or maybe you've only just come across it, but are
not sure what it means exactly. 
A raw food vegan diet
consists of unprocessed plant-based ideally organic wholefoods such as fruits,
vegetables, nuts, seeds, and grains that are eaten cold or a little warm, as
long as the temperature doesn't go above 46 degrees. 
This temperature is generally
accepted as the cut-off point beyond which vital nutrients and natural enzymes
are destroyed by the cooking process. That’s why raw foods are also referred to
as live or “living” foods.
                               Our bodies need the enzymes
found in these raw “living” foods because they aid digestion, help fight
chronic disease like arthritis and diabetes, clear up headaches and allergies,
improve your immunity and enhance your memory and ability to concentrate. 
Since wholefoods are all
naturally high in vitamins, minerals, fibre, and phytochemicals that are not
zapped by heat, eating a wide variety of such foods on a regular basis can boost
energy, increase the body’s ability to remove toxins, help burn calories,
improve your complexion and assist with weight loss. 
We all know that eating lots
of fruit and vegetables is good for us but who has the time to shop, cut and
prep wholefoods every day? While a full raw diet is not suitable or practical
for everyone, we believe that each one of us can benefit by introducing more
raw wholefoods into our daily diet. 
And one of the easiest ways
to do this is through our healthy Raw
Wholefood Snack Bars.
Research and studies have
shown that people are finally ready to embrace a healthy, raw, organic clean
food lifestyle. This is not a fad or a diet, but a way of consuming food that
serves the body well and keeps it healthy, strong and in balance. 
According To Recent Studies:


64% of men and 74% of women ‘really care about what
they eat’ (HSCIC).


The cereal, energy and snack bars market is set to
continue growing with forecast of 32% to £560 million by 2017 in the UK
(Mintel).


Overall organic sales grew by over 1% in 2013
(Nielsen).


98% of adults snack at home or work and 70% snack
on-the-go (Mintel).


Healthy foods cost around 3 times as much as unhealthy
foods (Cambridge University).


Based on this research we
created our flagship product – Raw
Wholefood Snack Bars – to fit into people’s lives and meet them at their
point of need, a healthy live organic snack they can consume on the go, at work
or play.

diet and unhealthy eating and heart disease. As the world becomes more and more
unwell one of the leading factors is a poor diet.                              For many years we have all
been led to believe that a variety of factors have been the cause but we have
never really been told the truth about the positive impact of eating raw foods
until now.
The struggle to eat healthy and
find healthy snacks that taste great, are genuinely good for you and come in a
convenient format are challenges faced by many people every day. 
We plan to address this need by
introducing our Raw Wholefood Snack Bars
as a convenient healthy solution.

tip of the iceberg, so to speak, however this is a significant step in the
healthy eating revolution. 


Every contributor will have the opportunity to

Bars in a variety of flavours


This campaign and the promotion of our Raw Wholefood Snack Bars will educate
people on the benefits of snacking healthily in order to manage calorie intake

diet, by providing raw wholefood goodness in the form of a convenient snack

<p></p><h3>
<b>How do we help?</b> </h3>
By making sure the anti-venom reaches the people who need it! Each vial is
given at a special subsidized rate of $10 so that the not-for-profit medical
centres, set up in parts of rural India catering to those who can’t access
treatment in big hospitals, can use it for the victims of snake bites.

<p><b></b></p><h3><b>$5000 dollars = 500 anti-venom<b>

</b><p><b>One human life could be saved with approximately 5 vials</b></p>

given at a special subsidized rate of $10 so that the not-for-profit medical
centres, set up in parts of rural India catering to those who can’t access
treatment in big hospitals, can use it for the victims of snake bites.

$5000 dollars = 500 anti-venom
vials 
One human life could be saved with approximately 5 vials
(The number of vials administered depends on various factors including the height, weight of the victim as well as the severity of symptoms) 
Monsoon
has already arrived in some parts of India and is expected to make their
appearance all over the country by the end of July. More snakes tend to emerge
during this season than any other, as they seek dry shelter increasing
instances of conflict and bites. In Pithora, which is just one block of one
district of Chhattisgarh, where we currently help a not for profit hospital  "" Anjali  health care centre "" which treat snakes bites and it is the only place in a radius of 80 kms where snake bite can be treated.  Since 2014 we are supporting the hospital  by equipping them with a ventilaor ( a much needed life support system in snake bite treatment ) , sending the doctor to participate in a snake bite workshop & establish a 24 x 7 support over phone by  snake bite treatment experts who will oversee the treatment. We
anticipate an average of 60-80 cases between July to October, out which at
least 25 will require urgent medical attention due to venomous snake bites.
In
addition to that block, we also aim to stock a minimum of 500 anti-venom vials
across selected non-profit health care centres in rural India to make sure they
ALWAYS have vials handy this monsoon, in case of emergencies.
What percentage of the target
money goes to Indiansnakes.org for other purposes?   Zero.       All the money given will be used for procuring the anti-venom for the
non-profit charity.
Any
amount that we raise over $5000 will be used to make awareness material for the
public, in regional languages, to educate people about snake bites and proper
first aid, encouraging them to always go to the hospital and seek treatment. 
Who are we and why are doing
this?
About Indiansnakes:
· 
Indiansnakes is a voluntary a group of committed young
herpetologists (mostly snake experts) and conservationists from across
India, working towards mitigating the snake bite deaths across the
country. We also run the largest snake database of the country along with
one of the biggest snake rescuer maps, plotting all rescuers across India.
· 
More than 45000 people die of snake bites in India and we would
like to replicate a successful working model to resolve this  problem
across the country. Our aim is a 50% reduction in deaths in the next 5 years!
(Click to read the full technical report on  Snakebite Mortality in India: A Nationally Representative Mortality Survey )· 
By setting up about ten rural snake bite treatment centers in
association with not-for-profit hospitals across India, we propose to set a
cost effective and practical solution for snake bite deaths.

Indiansnakes vision: #ZeroSnakeBites24x7 anti-venom  availability : Making sure that there is enough stock of
anti-venom for the health care centres to never be caught without enough vials
in hand to tackle any emergency, on any day, at any hour.
Capacity building workshops: To hold workshops with leaders of select villages.
This includes but is not limited to school teachers, health workers,
representatives from the educated youth, and members of local NGOs. The aim of
the workshops will be to help them understand about snakes, snake bites and how
essential medical treatment is especially incase of venomous snake bites.
Awareness: Sensitising the public and key authorities on proper
first-aid procedures at the site and how the on-lookers can help in containing
venom in a timely manner before the patient is taken to the hospital. They will
also be taught how to avoid snake bites during monsoons which is generally the
time of the year when maximum bites occur. Modes, depending on resources available,
will include audio visuals (radio, powerpoint presentations), visuals (posters,
banners) among other tried and test communication modules.

<p>I am Nancy Novack, Founder and Director of Nancy’s List and Nancy’s Club. I am immensely grateful to everyone who generously supports our commitment to improve the quality of the lives of our many neighbors who are living with cancer and those who love and care for them.</p>
<p>My MISSION is very clear … and I am PASSIONATE! I want to make very certain that no one in the world is alone in the dark with cancer.</p>
<p>I survived a lethal cancer diagnosis (April 29, 2004, stage 4 ovarian metastasized into my liver) and my gratitude for my life is abundant. I know the fear, the desperate anxiety, the profound loneliness, how broken and breathless one can feel when one hears those words,”You have cancer.”</p>
<p>I created the anthology <em>I Am with You: Love Letters to Cancer Patients</em> with 46 authors who truly understood my vision because it was so obvious. You are alone and perhaps awake all night. Your loved ones have gone to their warm beds and you are likely in a very strange bed in a extremely strange hospital room and you have never ever ever felt so scared. And even though you may be surrounded by nurses waking you up to give you a sleeping pill or perhaps a loved one standing beside you holding your hand and wiping your brow, the questions and worries are heart-breaking … “Am I going to die?” “What part of me is dying?” “Why me?” “Why now?” “Please help me. Please. Tell me I am not going to die.”</p>
<p>On that sleepless night, and for many thereafter, I needed to connect with people who knew how to talk to me, who understood what I was freaking out about, who had been there, who had the same or worse fears, who knew ME … who just simply knew who I was in that moment. I didn’t need answers to my enormous questioning but I so needed to feel connected to kindred spirits. I so needed that.</p>
<p>I am PASSIONATE about getting our anthology into the hands of patients when they need our support the most … in my mind, the night of their diagnosis. Our book can mean so much. We offer connection. We offer our wisdom and love and relationship, and our pragmatic ways of coping with the shock and awe. That is when we are needed … desperately needed.</p>
<p>My magnificent community of writers truly understood that our audience ideally would be those men and women of all ages … and those who love them and would care for them … who had just experienced one of life’s most traumatic experiences. The writers gathered from all over this country and a lovely man from Ireland joined us. We shared the same intention. We had experienced the same experience. We knew that the book of essays needed to address that time when a newly-diagnosed patient faces her or his dramatically changed world.</p>
<p>We were joined by a mission … to make a difference.We share passion, determination, camaraderie, memories, frustration.<br/>And we hold tight to our vision that we would have a balance … the number of men and women, the different diagnoses,<br/>the single occurrence vs. the many recurrences, the children, the families, the caregivers. We knew what we were doing and we did it very well.</p>
<p>We completed the book and it was published a month before expected. We generously gave it to hospitals and oncologists and cancer organizations. We did sell a good number and we received fabulous feedback. I anticipated that cancer hospitals and oncologists would jump for joy when we published … that now they had something REAL to offer these patients rather than a wicked diagnosis … something that immediately could bring these frightened persons a compassionate hand and heart and, most importantly, connection to sisters and brothers who had ‘walked the cancer walk’.</p>
<p>However … as some of you have heard me vent … that is not the reality. After donating so many books to various hospitals, the response is “beautiful, powerful, great work” AND “We have no budget to care for the emotional needs of our patients.” Oh, we knew that already!!! That is why we wrote the book!</p>
<p>This small book means so much to me and to the authors and designers. Creating this book together taught me far more<br/>about human beings and their capacity for love than I ever learned in kindergarten. Our book is a community ‘tour de force’ and I am very proud and honored to be in the same sentence as these remarkable courageous generous spirits.</p>
<p>I can’t be stopped when I have a passion. I am beginning a new approach … asking everyone I know and many I don’t know<br/>to be very very sure that<br/>NO ONE WILL EVER GO THROUGH CANCER ALONE.</p>
<p>I want your help. And I need it.</p>
<p>I want to take an author or two or ten and talk … radio, TV, cancer conferences, Oprah, whatever, and tell OUR story and why we care.</p>
<p>I invite people to donate to Nancy’s List so that I can donate books in their name … specifically to a doctor or hospital or infusion center or a nurse or whomever or whatever made a difference in their treatment. I want people to donate books in honor of a loved one’s recovery or in memory of the love they shared with a cancer patient. These books will be placed in the patients’ rooms the night of the diagnosis or in their new patient packets, in the infusion and radiation centers, in hospital libraries, the waiting rooms, in the oncologists’ offices.</p>
<p>Please send your contribution to<br/>Nancy’s List<br/>3421 Pecos Street, Unit 4,<br/>Austin, Texas 78703.<br/>I will gift books to the doctor or institution of your choice. All donations are tax deductible to the extent permitted by law. Nancy’s List is a non-profit 501©(3) foundation. Our tax ID number is 20-5899826.</p>
<p>I need your help in identifying pharmas, foundations, and ANYONE involved in the cancer world who will support our costs of publication.</p>
<p>I ask everyone who has been touched by the book (and I so appreciate all your beautiful feedback) to push it all over social media with these links for ordering through<strong>Amazon</strong> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Am-You-Letters-Cancer-Patients/dp/0985939974/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436709359&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=I+am+with+you"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Am-You-Letters-Cancer-Patients/dp/0985939974/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436709359&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=I+am+with+you</a> or <strong>Book Passage</strong>(<a href=""http://www.bookpassage.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.BookPassage.com</a>). Book Passage is a wonderful independent bookstore in San Francisco and Corte Madera.</p>
<p>Please pay it forward. And hit Amazon and give them your review …</p>
<p>Who do you know? How can I contact with them or will you make an introduction? We could really use a fine publicist or PR person. Think about individuals (particularly ones who have had cancer and want to ‘give back’ to new patients), companies that make money off of cancer patients and ‘should’ give back, women’s and men’s philanthropic organizations,<br/>GOOD people who appreciate what we have created.</p>
<p>I want to write more books … for the parents of children who are diagnosed for cancer, for teens and young adults. I need to resolve these issues so we can move forward.</p>
<p>I LOVE what we created together. I want everyone in the world to benefit from our splendid work.</p>
<p>My PASSION is set in my heart … I want to be very sure that no one walks in the dark with cancer. We can help. We do.</p>
<p>With so much love and gratitude,<br/>Nancy Novack</p>

<p><i>I Am with You: Love Letters to Cancer Patients</i> is an offering of friendship to sustain a newly diagnosed patient on the day he or she receives the diagnosis of cancer and throughout the journey, to support those who love and care for the patient. I am with you ... as are all of the 46 writers who have grappled with cancer themselves or alongside their loved ones. <i>I Am with You</i> is a book of hope, wisdom, wit, inspiration, compassion, and love. It is so good, so rich in detail and deep in feeling. Every essay speaks to the power of those simple exquisite words spoken to me by my oncologist, ""I am with you.""</p>
<p>With your generosity and collaboration, I will be able to donate books to the cancer healing centers around the world ...  so that this powerful helpful book can get into the hands of those who need it the most. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>The more funding, the more impact we can make. I am asking for $10,000. I can place 1,000 books into the hands of patients, the medical libraries, the waiting rooms, the infusion and radiation centers, and hopefully in the binders of newly diagnosed patients. </div>
<div>And for you ... MY GRATITUDE! For every $100 you contribute, I will send you a personally inscribed copy. I will donate the books to the institution or oncologist or nurse practitioner or social worker of your choosing to distribute as you wish. </div>
<div>Nancy's List is a 501(c)(3) organization and I will send you an acknowledgment letter for your tax purposes. </div>
<div>I know I will reach my goal because this is such a valuable book and it is filled with love and hope. I will be able to offer as many books as I am able to fund. </div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>As a clinical psychologist and, most importantly, as a survivor of a very lethal form of cancer (I am Stanford's poster child), I have had the honor to meet and consult with many many cancer patients and their loved ones. Because of my specific diagnosis and my miraculous recovery, I have worked with many women around the world with difficult challenges. The unfortunate part is that I have met these patients late in their treatment, sometimes too late, and our work together is more about dying than living. </div>
<div>My goal with this book is to help patients, particularly newly-diagnosed patients, develop a relationship with their cancer <i>early</i> in the process, one that is based on hope, choices, truth, great coping strategies, community support, and love. Each essayist in the book has a section to share what helped her or him get ""through the angst and agony"" of having cancer. They offer very practical suggestions for coping with their traumas. I consider this to be one of the more profound parts of the anthology. </div>

I am Nancy Novack, Founder and Director of Nancy’s List and Nancy’s Club. I am immensely grateful to everyone who generously supports our commitment to improve the quality of the lives of our many neighbors who are living with cancer and those who love and care for them.
My MISSION is very clear … and I am PASSIONATE! I want to make very certain that no one in the world is alone in the dark with cancer.
I survived a lethal cancer diagnosis (April 29, 2004, stage 4 ovarian metastasized into my liver) and my gratitude for my life is abundant. I know the fear, the desperate anxiety, the profound loneliness, how broken and breathless one can feel when one hears those words,”You have cancer.”
I created the anthology I Am with You: Love Letters to Cancer Patients with 46 authors who truly understood my vision because it was so obvious. You are alone and perhaps awake all night. Your loved ones have gone to their warm beds and you are likely in a very strange bed in a extremely strange hospital room and you have never ever ever felt so scared. And even though you may be surrounded by nurses waking you up to give you a sleeping pill or perhaps a loved one standing beside you holding your hand and wiping your brow, the questions and worries are heart-breaking … “Am I going to die?” “What part of me is dying?” “Why me?” “Why now?” “Please help me. Please. Tell me I am not going to die.”
On that sleepless night, and for many thereafter, I needed to connect with people who knew how to talk to me, who understood what I was freaking out about, who had been there, who had the same or worse fears, who knew ME … who just simply knew who I was in that moment. I didn’t need answers to my enormous questioning but I so needed to feel connected to kindred spirits. I so needed that.
I am PASSIONATE about getting our anthology into the hands of patients when they need our support the most … in my mind, the night of their diagnosis. Our book can mean so much. We offer connection. We offer our wisdom and love and relationship, and our pragmatic ways of coping with the shock and awe. That is when we are needed … desperately needed.
My magnificent community of writers truly understood that our audience ideally would be those men and women of all ages … and those who love them and would care for them … who had just experienced one of life’s most traumatic experiences. The writers gathered from all over this country and a lovely man from Ireland joined us. We shared the same intention. We had experienced the same experience. We knew that the book of essays needed to address that time when a newly-diagnosed patient faces her or his dramatically changed world.
We were joined by a mission … to make a difference.We share passion, determination, camaraderie, memories, frustration.And we hold tight to our vision that we would have a balance … the number of men and women, the different diagnoses,the single occurrence vs. the many recurrences, the children, the families, the caregivers. We knew what we were doing and we did it very well.
We completed the book and it was published a month before expected. We generously gave it to hospitals and oncologists and cancer organizations. We did sell a good number and we received fabulous feedback. I anticipated that cancer hospitals and oncologists would jump for joy when we published … that now they had something REAL to offer these patients rather than a wicked diagnosis … something that immediately could bring these frightened persons a compassionate hand and heart and, most importantly, connection to sisters and brothers who had ‘walked the cancer walk’.
However … as some of you have heard me vent … that is not the reality. After donating so many books to various hospitals, the response is “beautiful, powerful, great work” AND “We have no budget to care for the emotional needs of our patients.” Oh, we knew that already!!! That is why we wrote the book!
This small book means so much to me and to the authors and designers. Creating this book together taught me far moreabout human beings and their capacity for love than I ever learned in kindergarten. Our book is a community ‘tour de force’ and I am very proud and honored to be in the same sentence as these remarkable courageous generous spirits.
I can’t be stopped when I have a passion. I am beginning a new approach … asking everyone I know and many I don’t knowto be very very sure thatNO ONE WILL EVER GO THROUGH CANCER ALONE.
I want your help. And I need it.
I want to take an author or two or ten and talk … radio, TV, cancer conferences, Oprah, whatever, and tell OUR story and why we care.
I invite people to donate to Nancy’s List so that I can donate books in their name … specifically to a doctor or hospital or infusion center or a nurse or whomever or whatever made a difference in their treatment. I want people to donate books in honor of a loved one’s recovery or in memory of the love they shared with a cancer patient. These books will be placed in the patients’ rooms the night of the diagnosis or in their new patient packets, in the infusion and radiation centers, in hospital libraries, the waiting rooms, in the oncologists’ offices.
Please send your contribution toNancy’s List3421 Pecos Street, Unit 4,Austin, Texas 78703.I will gift books to the doctor or institution of your choice. All donations are tax deductible to the extent permitted by law. Nancy’s List is a non-profit 501©(3) foundation. Our tax ID number is 20-5899826.
I need your help in identifying pharmas, foundations, and ANYONE involved in the cancer world who will support our costs of publication.
I ask everyone who has been touched by the book (and I so appreciate all your beautiful feedback) to push it all over social media with these links for ordering throughAmazon http://www.amazon.com/Am-You-Letters-Cancer-Patients/dp/0985939974/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1436709359&sr=1-1&keywords=I+am+with+you or Book Passage(www.BookPassage.com). Book Passage is a wonderful independent bookstore in San Francisco and Corte Madera.
Please pay it forward. And hit Amazon and give them your review …
Who do you know? How can I contact with them or will you make an introduction? We could really use a fine publicist or PR person. Think about individuals (particularly ones who have had cancer and want to ‘give back’ to new patients), companies that make money off of cancer patients and ‘should’ give back, women’s and men’s philanthropic organizations,GOOD people who appreciate what we have created.
I want to write more books … for the parents of children who are diagnosed for cancer, for teens and young adults. I need to resolve these issues so we can move forward.
I LOVE what we created together. I want everyone in the world to benefit from our splendid work.
My PASSION is set in my heart … I want to be very sure that no one walks in the dark with cancer. We can help. We do.
With so much love and gratitude,Nancy Novack

I Am with You: Love Letters to Cancer Patients is an offering of friendship to sustain a newly diagnosed patient on the day he or she receives the diagnosis of cancer and throughout the journey, to support those who love and care for the patient. I am with you ... as are all of the 46 writers who have grappled with cancer themselves or alongside their loved ones. I Am with You is a book of hope, wisdom, wit, inspiration, compassion, and love. It is so good, so rich in detail and deep in feeling. Every essay speaks to the power of those simple exquisite words spoken to me by my oncologist, ""I am with you.""
With your generosity and collaboration, I will be able to donate books to the cancer healing centers around the world ...  so that this powerful helpful book can get into the hands of those who need it the most. 
   What We Need & What You Get
 
The more funding, the more impact we can make. I am asking for $10,000. I can place 1,000 books into the hands of patients, the medical libraries, the waiting rooms, the infusion and radiation centers, and hopefully in the binders of newly diagnosed patients. 
And for you ... MY GRATITUDE! For every $100 you contribute, I will send you a personally inscribed copy. I will donate the books to the institution or oncologist or nurse practitioner or social worker of your choosing to distribute as you wish. 
Nancy's List is a 501(c)(3) organization and I will send you an acknowledgment letter for your tax purposes. 
I know I will reach my goal because this is such a valuable book and it is filled with love and hope. I will be able to offer as many books as I am able to fund. 
   The Impact
 
As a clinical psychologist and, most importantly, as a survivor of a very lethal form of cancer (I am Stanford's poster child), I have had the honor to meet and consult with many many cancer patients and their loved ones. Because of my specific diagnosis and my miraculous recovery, I have worked with many women around the world with difficult challenges. The unfortunate part is that I have met these patients late in their treatment, sometimes too late, and our work together is more about dying than living. 
My goal with this book is to help patients, particularly newly-diagnosed patients, develop a relationship with their cancer early in the process, one that is based on hope, choices, truth, great coping strategies, community support, and love. Each essayist in the book has a section to share what helped her or him get ""through the angst and agony"" of having cancer. They offer very practical suggestions for coping with their traumas. I consider this to be one of the more profound parts of the anthology. 

I would like to share some of the reviews we have received ...
""I thought it might be worth noting that I read your book while standing several steps between the refrigerator and the kitchen counter. That is, I read nearly the entire book, standing in the middle of the kitchen, by the light above the sink. This is not exactly The New York Times Book Review, but probably a good sign nonetheless. It occurred to me that all of the stories are vividly, unmistakably about living. Your book isn't just for people facing cancer. It's for anyone facing life.""





""I took my Warrior Mask off just long enough to read these courageous, inspiring essays in Nancy's book. We all need stories overflowing with wisdom, healing, hope and love. Thanks, Nancy, for the uplifting reminder of how precious life is and how tenacious we must be to preserve it. If there was a word stronger than BRILLIANT to describe this book, I would use it. I have tears of joy for these amazing fighters and for their willingness to share their stories with us. These stories shine on us the light we need to keep moving forward despite the odds. Do your friends a favor if they are fighting any kind of debilitating illness and send them a copy of this book NOW.""
""I loved the book. A beautiful book and collaboration by so many cancer survivors, including me. I am honored to be a part of such a wonderful group of loving, caring strong people and their stories inspire me. The stories will bring tears, laughter, pride and thoughtfulness. We tell our stories not to bemoan the fact that we have or have had cancer (3 times for me), but that we are joyfully living our lives.""



""I wish this was published when my mom was battling cancer. It's heartfelt, informative and a wonderful collection of love in regards to the horrible disease. Thank you!""


""No amount of data moves us like a personal story can! These honest, open-hearted stories from those who have been there help in a way nothing else can. This is a beautiful book in every way! You couldn't get a more touching, loving and even humorous account of having to deal with this tragedy than from this wonderful book. It speaks with heart-warming honesty ... cancer patients are a very special and brave lot and this book is a testament to it. Could not be more pleased!""




""A friend gave me this book recently, as I am just finishing a journey with cancer, and it helps to reaffirm trust, inner strength and the love that heals. I bought several to send to other friends who are experiencing the emotional and physical roller coaster that is part of this challenge. Kudos to the women who compiled this positive antidote to all the fear-based rhetoric one can find on the Internet or from rigid medicine. The love and gratitude expressed can do wonders for women, and I hope this book gets into every cancer center!""




""People who fight for their lives and show us the beauty of life are gifts. Each chapter in this book is a gift.""
""I Am With You is a book of hope and healing for new cancer patients. Cancer survivors share different aspects of their cancer story in this very moving and inspiring book about life. It is a book for everyone. I originally bought the book because a friend of mine wrote one of the chapters. I bought another copy for a client who was struggling with severe medical issues. However, once I started reading, I opened up to so much more. It is a heart-felt experience. So far every story has brought me to tears. This should be essential reading for new cancer patients. If I were newly diagnosed with cancer and received this this book, I really wouldn't feel alone. If you know someone with cancer, reach out and be part of their community of support. They need you. Bring them dinner, walk their dog, watch TV together -- whatever it is they would like you to do. Love them.
