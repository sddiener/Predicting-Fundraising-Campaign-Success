<h3>Why Edinburgh?</h3>
<p><i>""What was that joke? </i><i>He's still got a career! What's the punchline?  I'm opening for him, still opening for him! Forced, ripped, splayed, battered and fried.""</i></p>
<p>The short answer – this show deserves a global audience. </p>
<p>The long answer – Edinburgh Festival Fringe is the largest arts festival in the world.  In 2018, 30,000 artists participated in over 3,500 shows. Many, many respected artists got their start at the Fringe and have made leaps in their careers by getting their work seen by global producers and programers during the festival. </p>
<p><i>Brandi Alexander</i> is a visceral, unapologetic show that needs to be seen.  And Brandi didn't come to play.</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p><i>""How's this outfit working for you all? The last time I was all dolled up, some well-meaning gentleman told me I looked like Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie.""</i></p>
<p>The short answer – $8,000. </p>
<p>The long answer – <i>any</i> money you give is going towards an apartment for the team during the month of the festival (almost half the budget), flights, graphic design, artist stipends, props, rehearsal space, board op, and a back up costume in case the zipper gives (you've been there, admit it). </p>
<p>Even if the entire goal isn't reached, any funds received will be used towards the festival costs.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Just don't have the money, honey? We've all been there. Here are some other things you can do to help this show soar: </p>

<li>Spread the love – pass along the campaign and show on social media. </li>

""What was that joke? He's still got a career! What's the punchline?  I'm opening for him, still opening for him! Forced, ripped, splayed, battered and fried.""
The short answer – this show deserves a global audience. 
The long answer – Edinburgh Festival Fringe is the largest arts festival in the world.  In 2018, 30,000 artists participated in over 3,500 shows. Many, many respected artists got their start at the Fringe and have made leaps in their careers by getting their work seen by global producers and programers during the festival. 
Brandi Alexander is a visceral, unapologetic show that needs to be seen.  And Brandi didn't come to play.

What We Need 
""How's this outfit working for you all? The last time I was all dolled up, some well-meaning gentleman told me I looked like Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie.""
The short answer – $8,000. 
The long answer – any money you give is going towards an apartment for the team during the month of the festival (almost half the budget), flights, graphic design, artist stipends, props, rehearsal space, board op, and a back up costume in case the zipper gives (you've been there, admit it). 
Even if the entire goal isn't reached, any funds received will be used towards the festival costs.


Other Ways You Can Help
Just don't have the money, honey? We've all been there. Here are some other things you can do to help this show soar: 

Spread the love – pass along the campaign and show on social media. 
Come see the show! We run from July 31 – August 25th and you can buy tickets here. 
Tell others to check out Brandi. She's an extrovert and is looking for a large audience for her comeback tour! 

Thank you all, you beautiful generous people. Images by Peter Fedorchuk and Marcia Davis.",4.0,0,"3 Campaigns

</p><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Starting in March of 2002 Chromolume Theatre has been creating theater for
12 years, in fact we just celebrated our anniversary on March 22. We were a
nomadic theatrer company for our first three years, putting up shows around the
city of Los Angeles. In 2007 we took up residency at Theatre/Theatre with our
NAACP award winning production of, Do Lord Remember Me. We are a smart company
and when we were in over our heads we took a hideous and closed our doors in
order to pay back our debt before we continued. When we were able to pay off
the $60,000, we reopened our doors. We took over the Attic Theater
&amp; Film Center in Los Angeles in May of 2012 and since then we have been
able to produce a large amount of shows. When we took over the Attic we knew we
wanted to help renovate and make it a better place of business, so at the
beginning of this year we started our renovations. We have about 10 phases we
will be going through until we feel it will be a complete renovation. We
started by turning our old rehearsal space into a Dance Studio. We are so very
pleased with the end result. We will be moving on to renovate our dressing
rooms, house, and lobby as well as creating a new dressing room and workshop
space in the area directly behind our building. All of these renovations are
very positive additions to our company. The Chromolume Theatre 2014 season is
kicking off on April 4<sup>th</sup> with our production of AltarBoyz, but
because of of the renovations we have started to do, we are not able to afford
the necessary microphones for our production. We are asking you to make a
donation of any amount to help us raise the $2000, we need, to purchase the 5
wireless microphones, 16 channel mixer and enough cable and accessories we
need. Our actors and creative team bring more than enough talent to the show,
but it won’t mean as much if the Actors aren’t being heard over our 3 piece live
band</p>
<p>Our production of AltarBoyz, really can't be done without wireless
microphones. We have been working with an amazing local sound company to find
affordable, yet, quality equipment for us, after all of they have done to help
bring their cost down to help us the lowest cost they could quote us is around
$2000, which is amazing but still too much for us at this time. </p>
<p>Musical theater is such an important part of our culture, and we really want
to keep producing more. Our production will be running for 6 weeks with 3 shows
a weekend, and that is simply too much for any actor to be able to continue to
sing without overusing their voice, unless they are using microphones,
especially because we will have a live 3 piece band on stage with them. </p>
<p>Your contribution would help us be able to afford the right equipment and
would help us put on our show in the best way possible.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the promotional video we created with our cast lip syncing
to the Original recording. Just further proves the talent we have in our cast. </p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/SazP4BrcdBM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/SazP4BrcdBM</a></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $2000, this money will help us afford to buy 5 wireless headset
microphones, the microphone packs, receivers, enough cable to connect them and
the proper 16 channel mixer. This is all of the equipment we need to be able to
""mic"" each of our 5 actors to amplify their voices while dancing,
singing and acting in our theater. </p>
<p>If you donate:</p>
<p>$5 Receive a thank you in our program!</p><p>$20 Signed photo of cast!<br/></p>
<p>$26 Chromolume Theatre T-shirt or Sweatshirt (featured in the video)</p>
<p>$40 Two Tickets to any AltarBoyz performance (4/4/14-5/11/14)</p>
<p>$75 Two Tickets to any AltarBoyz performance &amp; 2 free Chromolume
Dance Studio dance classes</p>
<p>$100 Two Tickets to any AltarBoyz performance, 2 free Chromolume Dance
Studio dance classes &amp; Chromolume Theatre T-shirt or Sweatshirt</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, your donations will still go to help our
production of AltarBoyz. We are cutting corners in other areas to be able to
get the best show we can with what we have. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have been making musical theater for so long and have been successful at
it because we make theater we believe in. Every production we do, is created by
a strong team of people and everyone believes in the common goal of making
amazing musical theater together. From our production team to our cast,
everyone is in it for the end result of making musical theater that can make a
positive impact in someones life. </p>
<p>Our amazing cast of AltarBoyz, is talent enough to make this show fabulous,
but the added benefits of costumes, sets and lighting is just a bonus. None of
that can mean anything if the audience can't hear the actors. We need to be
able to do our production with microphones. </p>
<p>We have not had to do a fundraising campaign of this type before, and we are
only doing one now because we know we need to be able to provide our production
with these microphones. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't able to help us financially through this campaign. Help spread
the word with us. Hopefully you can come see the show, you can check us out and
see what we are all about at our website. <a href=""http://www.Crtheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.crtheatre.com</a> </p>
<p>remember you can sacrifice one drink at your favorite coffee shop and use
that money to help us make musical theater. </p>
<p>You can also use the Indiegogo share tools to help spread the word and tell
your friends and family about our campaign. </p>

<h3>The Black Box Project is an accessible platform for emerging Black playwrights to develop new work and provide quality, culturally relevant theatre to the Black community.</h3>
<p>With a love for Black people centered in everything we do, the Black Box Project seeks to ensure the growth and vitality of theatre by Black dramatists for generations to come. </p>
<p>We are a group of theatre-makers who started The Black Box Project when we saw a lack of institutional support for emerging Black theatre artists in New York City. We’re leading a self-organizing movement to support our artist and their work, and to bring critical to new work to a stage it can call home.</p>
<p>To achieve our mission, every three months we produce a semi-staged reading of 1-3 excerpts, short, and full length plays written by Black early-career theater-makers. These artists not only get to show work at our public readings, but have the opportunity to receive feedback from their peers and established playwrights at invite-only pre-rehearsals. At the readings, they will also have an opportunity to connect with audience members, ask questions, and receive notes during a facilitated talkback. Finally, to establish a loving, connected community, we host a mixer that allows Black artists and theater-lovers to engage with each other, network, and dance the night away! We need community support to give Cycle 2 the same love our fabulous launch event got.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>Our funding need for this cycle are $6000, covering:</p>
<p>-Compensation for readers and actors during our public readings and rehearsals.</p>
<p>-Renting rehearsal space.</p>
<p>-A new fundraising event in December aimed to increase our programmatic capacity in the new year.</p>
<p>-Printing and office supplies for our readings.</p>
<p>-Props, supplies, and refreshments for the event.</p>

<p><strong><u>Project Background:</u></strong> For more than three years, <strong>Catherine Gigante-Brown</strong> has been working with director <strong>Susan Einhorn </strong>to transform Catherine’s novel <strong>“Different Drummer”</strong> into a musical. With Susan’s guidance, Catherine adapted the “book” for the stage. After a long search, she and Susan compiled an amazing songwriting team—<strong>Hannah Hickok</strong> (the “Hannah” of “Hannah and Maggie”) and<strong> Vinnie Corbo</strong> (lead singer/songwriter/founder of a seminal punk band).</p>
<p><strong><u>What We Need from You:</u> </strong>The team is now ready to present a staged reading so “Different Drummer.” But it takes funding to hire a large, professional cast, a musical director, casting director and general manager to make this happen. That’s where you come in!</p>
<p><strong><u>The Storyline:</u> </strong>“Different Drummer’s” lead character Cara Funk (neé Carol Finkelstein) is an enormously-talented, singing female drummer, desperately striving to “make it” in the bizarre, male-dominated music world. It’s set in 1979 New York City, amid graffiti-infested rock clubs, glitzy and garish catering halls, claustrophobic basement rehearsal spaces and state-of-the-art recording studios. Like “Alice” in a grungy “Wonderland,” Cara is helped and hindered by a revolving cast of characters—her mother, her on-again, off-again boyfriend, corrupt bandleaders. Rapidly approaching 30, this is Cara’s self-imposed last chance and she’s willing to sacrifice everything—friendships, relationships, family, her ideals—to succeed. Will she ultimately triumph, crash and burn, or just fade away?</p>
<p><strong><u>Why This Project is Important:</u> </strong>“Different Drummer’s” powerful story needs to be told. Its heroine Cara is the quintessential underdog struggling to succeed against all odds. Her challenges mirror our challenges…anyone who was ever told they weren’t good enough…anyone who was lied to, cheated and beaten down yet still has the strength to rise up, fight and believe in themselves.</p>

Her challenges mirror our challenges…anyone who was ever told they weren’t good enough…anyone who was lied to, cheated and beaten down yet still has the strength to rise up, fight and believe in themselves.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p> I am self-producing my own cabaret, with your help!</p>
<p><b>Who I Am</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Ben Watts. I’ve worked as an actor in St. Louis for the past 6 years.  Recently, I took a cabaret workshop taught by Tim Schall, the Executive Director of the Cabaret Project of St. Louis.  It was an 8 week intensive where we learned about the art of cabaret, the importance of song choice, and how to interact and hold a conversation with your audience, among others things.  We narrowed down song choices, turned our personal stories into “patter” for the audience, rehearsed our sets, and finally each student put together a short four song showcase, which we performed at the Kranzberg Arts Center in January.  <i>(You can see clips of my performance above!)</i></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had never done anything with cabaret up to that point, but the outpouring of compliments and support I received after the show from friends and family and strangers alike, was overwhelming.  Something felt very natural to me when I was up there performing.  It was all very new and very scary, but something clicked for me.  I knew I wanted to do it again.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p><b>Why I Need Your Help</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to take everything I learned from the workshop/showcase and put it to the test in a full-length show! But that means taking on this project by myself, without the guidance and benefit of a classroom or a curriculum.  And it takes a lot of time and money. </p>
<p>In addition to rehearsing the show, I’m also dealing with the business end of things, such as renting a venue, hiring a director and accompanist, and promoting the show.  I need your help to fund this project, so I can put on the best show possible (and have one less thing to worry about!)</p>
<p><b>What I’m Asking For</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>I need $2000 to make this happen.  All of the money will go to paying the director and accompanist, renting the venue, and lights, sounds, equipment, etc.</p>

Why I Need Your Help

I want to take everything I learned from the workshop/showcase and put it to the test in a full-length show! But that means taking on this project by myself, without the guidance and benefit of a classroom or a curriculum.  And it takes a lot of time and money. 
In addition to rehearsing the show, I’m also dealing with the business end of things, such as renting a venue, hiring a director and accompanist, and promoting the show.  I need your help to fund this project, so I can put on the best show possible (and have one less thing to worry about!)
What I’m Asking For

I need $2000 to make this happen.  All of the money will go to paying the director and accompanist, renting the venue, and lights, sounds, equipment, etc.


$1400—Rehearsal time with the director, Tim Schall,  and music director and accompanist, Carol Schmidt, including performance fees


$350—Rental fee for the performance venue


$200—Lights and sound, recording equipment


$50—Promotional materials



Not meeting this goal means I have to make cuts, which would most likely come out of the rehearsal budget.  Less rehearsal money means less rehearsal time and that leaves me with an underprepared, unprofessional show.  I don't want this to happen.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Millions know the name Ragan Courtney from the musical ""Celebrate Life!"" which he wrote with his friend, the late Buryl Red.  Produced in churches around the world, it set the standard for a new kind of Gospel musical and opened the door to other Courtney-written musicals, including ""Bright New Wings,"" ""Lottie D.,"" and many others.  His career as a playwright began with the musical ""The Earl of Ruston,"" which played all over the South and on Broadway at the Billy Rose Theater.  Mr. Courtney is also acclaimed as a poet with six books of poems published. </p>
<p>Now, Ragan Courtney is preparing three new one-act dramas for production.  ""Keys to the Kingdom"" features a father whose dreams have been shattered pouring out his heart to his developmentally-disabled son.  Does the young man understand or even hear?  ""Shabby Gentility"" reveals the long-suppressed secrets between two women, one white, one black, who've known each other their whole lives.  And ""The Gospel According to Ms. Flowers"" brings together a priest and an unusual visitor to the confessional.  Questions of gender identity and grace lead to a shocking ending.</p>
<p>To lead the workshop stage of the development of these plays, Mr. Courtney has entrusted the scripts to his former student and teaching colleague, M. Christopher Boyer.  Mr. Boyer has had a long career in professional and academic theatre, learning the new play development process during his time on staff at Actors Theatre of Louisville where he coordinated guest logistics for the Humana Festival of New American Plays, served as a script reader for that festival, and directed plays for the ongoing new short play work.  He went on to direct new play development as part of his work at A.D. Players as well as encouraging the production of new work in three companies where he served as managing director.</p>
<p>This one-week workshop process is a critical step in preparing these new scripts for production.  Mr. Courtney will have the opportunity to hear professional actors read and rehearse the plays and make changes based on what he and they learn together.  At the end of the week, an invited audience will also hear the plays and respond, giving yet more valuable input.  Given Ragan Courney's popularity, these issue-oriented plays have the potential to touch thousands of lives as he uses his dramatic gifts to examine situations of disability, racism, and gender identity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to make this process as effective as possible for the playwright, Mr. Boyer is gathering a cast of professional actors in one of the finest theatre cities in the country.  These artists and their stage manager will be paid at union rates to ensure that the best actors can participate.  Thanks to a generous donation of stage time, these stipends and lodging for Mr. Courtney in Seattle are the primary expenses of the project, estimated at $3,000.</p>
<ul>
<li>Donors at the $50 and higher level will receive electronic copies of the finished scripts.</li>
<li>Donors at the $100 and higher level will receive invitations to the final reading of the workshop in Seattle as well as copies of the finished scripts.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Because Ragan Courtney is a trusted artist in the evangelical community, these scripts give us the opportunity to open dialogue on issues of disability, race, and gender issues in venues where such conversations might not otherwise happen.  The successful development of these plays can provide a powerful tool in the ongoing work to build ""the Beloved Community.""</p>

<h3><strong>What is This, and Why Should I Care?</strong></h3>
<p>""The Marvelous Red Balloon"" is a piece of devised theatre about two scientist-lovers ripped apart from each other by nature, and their long journey to find each other. Devised theatre is a process of making new plays by filling a room with theatre artists to brainstorm and improvise together until a story, collaboratively created and edited by all, exists in a fixed form to be shared with an audience. <br/><br/>By design the story has very few predetermined elements outside of what's stated above, so that the final story is a reflection of each deviser as an individual and as a member of this group. We chose this process as a means to make more inclusive, equitable theatre.<br/><br/>Theatre at all levels is deceptively and cruelly expensive, and our plan to have hot air balloon companies sponsor us as an (admittedly) indirect means of advertising their business fell through faster than their crappy air balloons. So we return to you, our audience, asking that you help us so we may give back to you.</p>
<h3><strong>So, Who are You?</strong></h3>
<p>Red Dice Collective are three people: Andre Johnson Jr., Miranda Shunkwiler, and Mason Tyer. We all met a Iowa State University and, once finished our time in school, we went to work professionally in Minnesota's Twin Cities. We were taken in by some of the most caring and intelligent theatre artists we've ever met, and eventually we realized what elevated them from their peers: rather than try to be the best person in the room, they were dedicated to creating beautiful living moments for every audience member possible.<br/><br/>These people are rare, however, so we set to put ourselves in leadership positions in order to follow their example. From this love for the audience, Red Dice Collective (RDC) was born. While we continue professional development by working with other companies, our work as RDC is where we can pay it forward artistically to an audience.</p>
<p>In the Case of ""The Marvelous Red Balloon"", we're joined with our stage manager Sarah Maxwell and our perfomers Laura Mason, Kasey Manche, and Michael Weingartner.</p>
<h3>What Would My Money Buy, and What Do I Get?</h3>
<p>We're a frugal bunch at RDC; no 401(K)s or international research trips for us. What we're asking for is the minimum to make this thing happen.<br/><br/>$700 is for all the artist stipends: three performers, our stage manager, our director, and our designer. This show is planned to be very performer-focused, with very few set pieces or design accouterments, so they'll need to work hard. Thankfully we have some very skilled professionals, and they deserved to at least afford to buy a sandwich with chips AND a soda.<br/> <br/>$200 is for all the production needs. As minimalist a concept as we're going for, this is a world of Victorian fantasy: yelling on stage ""THEY FLEW AWAY"" isn't nearly as interesting as showing it. Set construction supplies, props, band-aids, paint, marketing all falls under this. Miranda is handling all of this, so she'll make $200 look like $452.17 (specific, yes, but so is she).<br/><br/>$100 is for the emergency. What emergency? Exactly: we don't know, but we want to be ready for it.<br/><br/>That totals our goal of $1000. Two scenarios to outline:<br/>1. We don't make our goal. We will triage to budget areas most important, with the first being to pay our artists (remember, sandwiches cost money) and then followed by production needs, with an emergency fund being last. It'll be tough, but every penny will count.<br/><br/>2. We overreach our goal. You studs. Some funds will be used to reimburse expenses that we considered donations (Andre is currently drowning in his bedroom from all the props he had to purchase and store there). Some funds will be passed along to actors (MORE SANDWICHES) because honestly they're working for us at bargain-bin prices and we know it. Finally, some funds will be used as a springboard for our next production already in the works.<br/><br/>Other than those soft gooey feelings you get when you give selflessly to others, we want to rewards those who believe in us. Check out our available perks!</p>
<h3><strong>Big Talk, But Can you even Make this Happen?</strong></h3>
<p>Oh baby, can we.<br/><br/>Though we are are early-career artists, don't mistake that for amateurs. Between the three core members of RDC, we have over 15 years of professional experience and easily over 20 productions in the three years we've all lived in the Twin Cities. We've been directors, actors, stage managers, set designers, sound and lights technicians, musicians, choreographers, teachers, and stage hands. Add that to our production's performers and stage manager, and you're looking at a whole bunch of bases double- and triple-covered. We got this.<br/><br/>Additionally, Arts Nests is comprised of very experienced professionals more than willing to be or find the unexpected resource we may need. They specialize in helping other companies bring productions to life, and they're ready to be hands on deck for us.</p>
<h3><strong>I would love to give you my life savings, but I can't. Is there some other way I can help?</strong></h3>
<p>Well of course, leading question! If you can't donate money, donate your time by taking a moment to spread the word about the campaign and our company.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name's Sarah Martens and I'm very excited to share with you the reason why I'm here. Having a background and passion for theatre, dance and yoga therapy drew me to drama therapist and anthropologist Dr. Sue Jennings inspiring book, Theatre, Ritual and Transformation. Feeling so grateful for the way in which she shared her time living with the Temiar people along with her young family compelled me to reach out to Dr. Jennings to thank her. A day later, she wrote back asking if I'd like to come to Malaysia with a small study group to learn about her drama therapy approach and experience  first hand how the Temiar people have informed her research and life's work.</p>
<p>Jennings developed her approach to therapy, Neuro Dramatic Play,by witnessing the strong bond that the Temiar women develop with their unborn children. The Temiar society also influenced her theories around non-invasive approaches to child rearing. The community has maintained their strong connection to traditional dance, song and guided trance ritual. Traditional doctors in the village use ritual to nurture a state of harmony and balance in the individual which ripples out to a healthy, peaceful society. An all night ritual of song, dance and trance has been planned during our stay with the Temiars, which I must confess intrigues me as much as it has me a bit nervous.</p>
<p>My fundraising goal includes aeroplane ticket cost, which from my findings is between $ 1,400-1,600 cdn depending on the day and flight time into and leaving from Kuala Lumpur. The tuition for the workshop and study group is 2,400 cdn, transferred from the British pound. So, my total goal is to raise 4,000 ( about 3000.00 US) in 30 days or less, which is a bit pressing!  Any extra will go toward food not covered during the trip (most is), late fees I will need to pay after March 2, (coming up quickly!), and if there's still extra ( dare to dream), I will put it towards my continuing creative collaboration with local theatre and felting artist, Marjorie Campbell, as we continue to explore the relationship between movement, wool felt and the participants connection with self and others in a movement therapy and performance type setting. </p>
<p>Looking beyond this adventure with Dr. Jennings, my goal upon returning to Canada is to incorporate all I've experienced and allow it to inform my work as a yoga/movement therapist, and artist. I feel that this time spent in Malaysia is a huge piece of a puzzle that is starting to take shape after many years of bringing it into focus. I am very interested in developing this therapeutic approach to work with people struggling with addiction, children with learning and behavioural issues, people with dementia as well as refugees living with post traumatic stress. </p>
<p>If you are interested in donating, please check out my perks. I apologize for those outside of Toronto who can't make it here to collect your perk, but please let me know if you ever do come to town.For those of you who would like to donate, but can't right now, not to worry, you can still help out a ton by sharing my Indiegogo campaign on social media and email to people you know who may want to support my fundraising goal.</p>
<p>Thank you mighty friends who've encouraged me to take this leap into the possibility of this opportunity becoming an actuality. </p>

A day later, she wrote back asking if I'd like to come to Malaysia with a small study group to learn about her drama therapy approach and experience  first hand how the Temiar people have informed her research and life's work.
Jennings developed her approach to therapy, Neuro Dramatic Play,by witnessing the strong bond that the Temiar women develop with their unborn children. The Temiar society also influenced her theories around non-invasive approaches to child rearing. The community has maintained their strong connection to traditional dance, song and guided trance ritual. Traditional doctors in the village use ritual to nurture a state of harmony and balance in the individual which ripples out to a healthy, peaceful society. An all night ritual of song, dance and trance has been planned during our stay with the Temiars, which I must confess intrigues me as much as it has me a bit nervous.
My fundraising goal includes aeroplane ticket cost, which from my findings is between $ 1,400-1,600 cdn depending on the day and flight time into and leaving from Kuala Lumpur. The tuition for the workshop and study group is 2,400 cdn, transferred from the British pound. So, my total goal is to raise 4,000 ( about 3000.00 US) in 30 days or less, which is a bit pressing!  Any extra will go toward food not covered during the trip (most is), late fees I will need to pay after March 2, (coming up quickly!), and if there's still extra ( dare to dream), I will put it towards my continuing creative collaboration with local theatre and felting artist, Marjorie Campbell, as we continue to explore the relationship between movement, wool felt and the participants connection with self and others in a movement therapy and performance type setting. 
Looking beyond this adventure with Dr. Jennings, my goal upon returning to Canada is to incorporate all I've experienced and allow it to inform my work as a yoga/movement therapist, and artist. I feel that this time spent in Malaysia is a huge piece of a puzzle that is starting to take shape after many years of bringing it into focus. I am very interested in developing this therapeutic approach to work with people struggling with addiction, children with learning and behavioural issues, people with dementia as well as refugees living with post traumatic stress. 
If you are interested in donating, please check out my perks. I apologize for those outside of Toronto who can't make it here to collect your perk, but please let me know if you ever do come to town.For those of you who would like to donate, but can't right now, not to worry, you can still help out a ton by sharing my Indiegogo campaign on social media and email to people you know who may want to support my fundraising goal.
Thank you mighty friends who've encouraged me to take this leap into the possibility of this opportunity becoming an actuality.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>“Before you start with your idea… Who are you?”</strong></p>
<p>My name is <strong>Dane Eissler</strong>. I’m a Chicago-based image-driven
theatre and performance artist with a focus on the macabre quirks and
absurdities of those considered “other”, fostering the discovery and understanding
of the “other” in oneself. Recently graduating from <strong>Rowan University</strong>
(BA in Theatre), I started my artistic career in the Philadelphia theatre
community, <strong>Associate Directing the Philadelphia Premiere of Tennessee
Williams’s <i>Stairs to the Roof </i>(EgoPo Classic Theatre) </strong>and <strong>Assistant
Directing Rowan University's original dance-theatre production </strong><b><em>They
Slice the Air</em></b>, as well as <strong>appearing in</strong> <strong>Stephen
Karam’s <i>Speech &amp; Debate</i> (Azuka Theatre)</strong> and<strong>
Fernando Arrabal’s <i>Fando y Lis </i>(Neighborhood Fringe Festival). </strong>I
am also a writer of original works, <strong>including</strong> <strong><i>I Love You,
Jane Doe </i></strong><em>and </em><strong><i>Violet of the Garden of Eden.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>“So what exactly are you looking to fund?”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dane Eissler’s <i>FOREVER FETAL</i>, part of the “f*cked up fable”

<p><i>All it takes is one brief taste of the outside world to send a scared

Junior, Jr. goes off to explore the outside world, Junior must face his fears

is a part-puppet, part-found object theatre fable about the discomfort of

any obstacle.</i></p>
<p>+ <b>The “f*cked up fable” series</b> is a series of theatrical works in the
style of fables or children’s theatre… that no child should be able to watch. With
this series of theatrical works, I aim to start important intellectual and

reinvigorating playful, childlike imagination of adult audiences. </p>
<p><strong>“That’s really cool. But why?”</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been dreaming of producing this piece for about a year and a half now,
but I’ve never felt it was the right time – until now. I moved to Chicago about

<p>Great question. In the event we don’t reach our fundraising goal, whatever

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Second,
 most of the time when LGBTQ youth are on the stage it is in plays that 
they have written. They courageously come forward and, often in 
monologue format, tell their coming-out stories. And often they find 
themselves ""preaching to the choir."" This play catches audiences by 
off-guard. It's a period drama. It deals with New England and Denver 
history. It looks like <em><i>Little House on the Prairie.</i> </em>Audiences 
come to it with a different frame of reference and different 
expectations-- and suddenly they are sucked into the drama about the 
vulnerability, the courage, and the honesty of these very young females 
wrestling with very adult secrets. <br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Third,
 the play is a challenge to the LGBTQ community, because in 1879 the 
concept of a lesbian butch and a trans man were equally moot. The play 
asks us to enter this 19th-century world and just listen to the 
characters on their own terms. It was my intention to create a neutral 
space amid a highly charged and highly polarized conversation.<br/><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>If you don't know my work, I have written 75 plays, including one-acts, one-woman shows, musicals, historical dramas, comedies, and adaptations. I have toured for more than 25 years performing my own work and lecturing about lesbian culture. <br/><br/>If you're curious about what other people have said about my work, here's a link: <a href=""http://carolyngage.weebly.com/endorsements.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://carolyngage.weebly.com/endorsements.html</a><br/><br/>I have been deeply inspired by the writings of African American author and activist <b>Toni Cade Bambara</b>.

 We need to raise $1500 to pay for period costumes (you can't buy them at Goodwill), rehearsal space in NYC ('nuff said), stipends for the actors and for director Nicole Kontalefa, and for professional videotaping, because we will need a good video in order to market the show for touring after the Festival.
Here are the perks:
$10  A PDF of any Gage one-act play. http://carolyngage.weebly.com/one-acts.html)
$25  A PDF of any Gage full-length play, or 3 one-acts. http://carolyngage.weebly.com/full-length-plays.html
$100 A CD of Carolyn Gage's performance of The Second Coming of Joan of Arc
$200  A paperback of any collection of Gage's plays. http://carolyngage.weebly.com/play-and-short-story-collections.html
If we do not reach our fundraising goal, we will budget for the minimal necessities.   The Impact 
What makes this play special? 
First, the age of the leads... fourteen.
Second,
 most of the time when LGBTQ youth are on the stage it is in plays that 
they have written. They courageously come forward and, often in 
monologue format, tell their coming-out stories. And often they find 
themselves ""preaching to the choir."" This play catches audiences by 
off-guard. It's a period drama. It deals with New England and Denver 
history. It looks like Little House on the Prairie. Audiences 
come to it with a different frame of reference and different 
expectations-- and suddenly they are sucked into the drama about the 
vulnerability, the courage, and the honesty of these very young females 
wrestling with very adult secrets. 
Third,
 the play is a challenge to the LGBTQ community, because in 1879 the 
concept of a lesbian butch and a trans man were equally moot. The play 
asks us to enter this 19th-century world and just listen to the 
characters on their own terms. It was my intention to create a neutral 
space amid a highly charged and highly polarized conversation.If you don't know my work, I have written 75 plays, including one-acts, one-woman shows, musicals, historical dramas, comedies, and adaptations. I have toured for more than 25 years performing my own work and lecturing about lesbian culture. If you're curious about what other people have said about my work, here's a link: http://carolyngage.weebly.com/endorsements.htmlI have been deeply inspired by the writings of African American author and activist Toni Cade Bambara. She wrote, ""I work to produce stories that save our lives.""

Our purpose is to connect with the community in order to help usher along transformation by presenting works that: stem from a Biblical worldview, expose struggles within the human condition and offer the opportunity for self-reflection.
Gilli!
Aduri is producing its premier production, Gilli, written by co-founder, Alison Campbell. Gilli, is a portrait of a family in the midst of a breakdown. It chronicles a year in the life of The Fletchers as they deal with the fallout from the mental incapacitation of their shining star. 
By supporting Aduri, you will give us the opportunity to raise awareness on an issue that effects one in four adults in a given year, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. 

Our Goal...Your Prizes
Gilli is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit service organization. All of the donations that are given on the Indiegogo campaign are tax-deductible. All of the donations that we receive will go towards our production costs.
Check out the PERKS section on the right! Choose 1 of the perks or give a completely tax-deductible donation.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>In 2008, Porcelain and Miss Rachel Riot started Raleigh, NC's first burlesque troupe: The Demon Dolls. Both are passionate about the art form and would like nothing more than to attend the Burlesque Hall of Fame Weekend in Las Vegas, NV this Memorial Day Weekend. As most creative types know, usually artistic endeavors don't create a ton of extra income-- which is why YOU are being asked to help fund their trip to Las Vegas! Money will be used for plane tickets, room and board, and food. Porcelain and Miss Rachel Riot want to be able to represent North Carolina at the largest and most important burlesque gathering in the United States.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donations help spread glitter, cheer, and fabulousness from coast to coast. Not only do Porcelain and Rachel Riot get to meet burlesque icons, but Las Vegas gets to meet Rachel Riot and Porcelain as well!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our fundraising goal is $3000. Flying on Memorial Day Weekend is going to cost us almost $1000, hotel for four nights, taxi's, shipping costumes, etc. Don't worry-- you get something for the money you donate! Check out our ""perks""!<br/></p>

We'll work out the rest of the funding from there. WHY IT’S URGENTLY NEEDED: We all have a sense that most national coverage focuses on L.A., D.C., and New York, and the statistics bear that out. In a recent survey of stories on NPR between 2006 and 2011, New York had 331 stories per year, Oklahoma had 14. You could say that’s because of population size, but even with its large size and population, Texas got less than half the national average of stories. There was a presidential election in 2008, so states like Ohio and Iowa got special attention. If you take presidential politics out of the mix, the numbers are stark: the middle of the country doesn't get the coverage it deserves. This is more than a show. This is the beginning of a revolution in news coverage. 
WHY WE NEED YOUR DONATION: 
We’re doing something that the big networks won’t. In order to do that, we need to launch this show independently, outside of the network system. If we want to maintain editorial control and stick to our core principles (stories only from middle America, partnerships with local stations), then we need to remain independent. 
And that means we need your donation. 
Listen to the pilots:


****************************
WHY WE CAN DO THIS BETTER THAN ANYONE: 
Celeste Headlee spent years reporting from Flagstaff, Arizona and then Detroit, Michigan before she became a national host on NPR and PRI. She knows from personal experience how hard it is to get stories from Middle America on the national shows and she’s heard the terrible coverage that results from sending D.C. reporters parachuting into a city to cover a story. Many people in this business automatically assume that stories from New York and L.A. are more important; Celeste does not. 


WHAT WE NEED: 
A basic studio setup with a mic, mixer, Telos unit for recording phone calls, acoustic foam for the walls and audio editing software. Those are all one-time investments. But we also need funds to pay local reporters for their stories, to pay commentators, and to pay local stations for studio time. 
WHAT WE WILL DO: 
Publish weekly updates for local stations to drop into existing programming. We will partner closely with stations in Middle America, give their reporters a platform and bring attention to the news of their communities. We’ll also publish longer podcasts regularly with the news, politics and culture of Middle America, bringing you the stories that national networks ignore and helping you understand the nation in a way you never have before. 
We will bring your countrymen and women a little closer, let you get to know the people that make this nation unique. This part is guaranteed. 
AND we will choose a home station for the show, a headquarters somewhere in the middle of the country. We will move our operations to that local public radio station and find a national distributor. This is the part we can’t guarantee, but there’s a lot of interest already from both stations and distributors. We just need a boost from you to get it off the ground.

It all starts with your donation.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello.  I’m Caitlin Hafer, artistic director of DanceLens.  Through Dance Lens, and the creation and presentation of dance films, I make dance accessible to people unfamiliar with or apprehensive of dance in general.  My goal is to make everyone comfortable with viewing dance, increase the audience, and strengthen the art form for the future.   </p>
<p>My newest project is entitled <em>Even A Dead Fish</em>.  </p>
<p>The project uses recognizable and relatable topics, such as conformity and socialization and popular film techniques such as Omnimax, 180 degree presentation, to create a dance performance that is both artistically relevant and easily accessible to all audiences. </p>
<p>Working with me on this project are Angela Mazziota, Katie Cassady, Colin Epstein, Kelvin Vu.  Each brings a unique viewpoint, both artistic and personal, to the project.  All of the collaborators have extensive technical training and are highly creative artists.  It is an honor to have such a talented and accomplished cast working with me on this project.   </p>
<p>The work draws material from media images of the 1950s and today regarding socialization and the ways in which media depicts “proper” behavior.   Each of my awesome collaborators, Angela Mazziota, Katie Cassady, Colin Epstein, and Kelvin Vu, performs a section in the work depicting a different aspect of socialization.  The project will be presented at The Garage December 19 and 20<sup>th</sup> and at other, later, events and locations.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>But I need your help to bring these plans into reality. </p>
<p>Because part of my goal is sustaining the artform, and my collaborators play such a major role in the realization of the work, my first necessity is paying the dancers.  That is what the first $1,000 is for.  The second need is the projectors for creating the omnimax style presentation.  Because many theaters have only one projector we need two more projectors to complete the project.  For this we need another $1,000. </p>
<p>That’s what we need.  Read on to learn how you can help us reach our $2,000 goal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, your donation is tax deductable through out Fiscal Sponsor Dancers’ Group! Make checks payable to Dancers’ Group (our fiscal sponsor) with Dancelens in the memo line.  Or you can pay online through Pay-Pal.  </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>By helping to fund this project you are also helping to sustain dance as an artform into the future.  While the funding for artist fees relate only to this project, the projectors can and will be used for many projects to come.  Also, this work can be a template for myself and others to investigate other ways that dance artists can create more accessible works to help increase and strengthen the audience into the future.  Thus, by supporting this campaign you are not only funding this work, but helping to support future works and the artform as a whole.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are other ways you can help besides monetary donations.  I am accepting donations of SD Camera cards, pudding and Jello mix, and saran wrap.  If you have another an item or skill you think would be helpful, please contact us with your suggestion!</p>
<p>The most important way you can help is to spread the word about <em>Even A Dead Fish</em>.  Tell everyone you know and come to see the show December 19 and 20<sup>th</sup> at The Garage!!</p>

Players, founded in 2010, is the community theater in Beaumont, CA. Since our first days in the Beaumont Women's Club Community Center, we  have put up 3 to 4 productions per year of such a quality that our directors, actors and set designer have been nominated for 37,  and won 27, awards for excellence from the Inland Theatre League (ITL). During those years, we also  have improved the live theater experience for our patrons in the community center by employing a ""cabaret"" seating plan, and by installing new curtains and  a new sound system.  Now, we want to enhance that experience even more.</p>
<p><b>Our Objective</b></p>
<p>Toward that end, we are
seeking to install fixed theatrical lighting in our performing venue to replace the light trees with the
20th century light “cans” hanging from each limb we have been using since we
opened the doors. LED fixtures will not only provide more illumination on and
around the stage, but will allow for the use of color combinations, one of the
languages of mood creation, all while requiring much less electricity. The new
installation will also relieve creaky backs and tired muscles from having to
move the old trees in and out and up and down each night of every production! Please
help us re-light that stage!  </p>

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p><strong>MOLLY PEASE</strong>, playwright &amp; executive producer. She is a queer southern comedy writer from Atlanta, Georgia. She holds an MFA in Writing for the Screen and Stage from Northwestern and Bachelor's degrees in Public Relations and Theatre from the University of Georgia. Molly has done pretty much every form of comedy. During her time at Northwestern, she created original sitcom pilots, plays, screenplays, and a sock puppet web series. She helps produce the annual showcase <i>Queergasm</i> at Northwestern. Her full-length play <i>Stix</i> received a stage reading at Northwestern in Spring 2017. Her feature length dramedy <i>Can I Finish?</i> won second place for the Krevoy Screenwriting Award. She currently lives with her cat, Bubby, in Chicago. </p>
<p><strong>SUSAN E. BOWEN</strong>, director &amp; co-producer. Since moving to Chicago eight years ago, Susan has directed and/or assistant directed at companies such as Jackalope Theatre, Lookingglass Theatre, A Red Orchid Theatre, and American Theater Company, among others. Some favorite projects in Chicago include: <i>History 2:2 </i>by Michael Allen Harris for Jackalope Theatre Company’s Living Newspaper Festival and <i>Queer Is Not Yet Here </i>by Jorge Ignacio Cortiñas for Pivot Arts. Most recently, Susan directed a remake of Lope de Vega's <i>Fuente Ovejuna, </i>which she coadapted with playwright Kori Alston at Northwestern University, where she is an MFA candidate in directing.</p>
<p><strong>RACHEL GREENHOE</strong>, co-producer. Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. She holds an MFA in Writing from Northwestern. She attended Sarah Lawrence College, where she studied playwriting with Sterling Spencer, Cassandra Medley and Lucy Thurber. Her play, ‘Not Retarded’, won the David Lindsay-Abaire award for playwriting and had a showcase performance the main stage. Two of her plays, ‘Not Retarded’ and ‘Tiger Trap’, have been produced in Off-Off Broadway showcases. Her latest play, ‘Monkey’, had its first reading at La Mama ETC. In addition to La Mama Rachel has worked with Mabou Mines, DTA, Fresh Fruit and Bass Films and interned with Motion picture Corporation of America and Nickelodeon. </p>
<p>We also have an INCREDIBLE female-centric team of actors, designers, and more working on this project. We will give you more information about them &amp; their work as the campaign continues!</p>
<h3>Why Stix?</h3>
<p>It's entertaining. It's fresh. It's relevant. Don't believe us?</p>
<p>Let's ask our team!</p>
<p>From the playwright, Molly Pease: ""I know a play about a talking Stick doesn't seem personal, but it feels relevant because it stems from many frustrations I have as a queer female artist today. There are so many ridiculously impossible expectations that we're suppose to meet! Sometimes it feels like a person could only meet those expectations if they were just an inanimate object that people could project their desires onto."" </p>
<p>From our co-producer, Rachel Greenhoe: ""I personally love the theme of ‘ownership of stories’ in the play. In these days of easily shared media content, sometimes it feels like no one truly owns their stories.""</p>
<p>From creative team member, Oona O'Leary: ""It's creative, it's different, it's of the moment without being on the nose.""</p>
<p><i>Stix</i> has also already had a staged reading at Northwestern University. What did they say about it?</p>
<p>Audience member: ""This is a dystopian play about American culture seen through the eyes of a stick. He is a total narcissist who is able to rise to power through pop culture. The arc of a celebrity rising to an influential position of power is particularly relevant right now. Overall, it’s a biting, witty play about wellness vs. American Capitalism.”</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Speaking of Capitalism...</h3>
<p>Currently we have a combined $6,000 in grants from Northwestern University and the Araca Project. However, that only covers 60% of our overall budget. Our ultimate goal is to raise the other 40% to complete a working  production of the show. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Realistic Budget </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">(based on past Araca Projects)</p>

MOLLY PEASE, playwright & executive producer. She is a queer southern comedy writer from Atlanta, Georgia. She holds an MFA in Writing for the Screen and Stage from Northwestern and Bachelor's degrees in Public Relations and Theatre from the University of Georgia. Molly has done pretty much every form of comedy. During her time at Northwestern, she created original sitcom pilots, plays, screenplays, and a sock puppet web series. She helps produce the annual showcase Queergasm at Northwestern. Her full-length play Stix received a stage reading at Northwestern in Spring 2017. Her feature length dramedy Can I Finish? won second place for the Krevoy Screenwriting Award. She currently lives with her cat, Bubby, in Chicago. 
SUSAN E. BOWEN, director & co-producer. Since moving to Chicago eight years ago, Susan has directed and/or assistant directed at companies such as Jackalope Theatre, Lookingglass Theatre, A Red Orchid Theatre, and American Theater Company, among others. Some favorite projects in Chicago include: History 2:2 by Michael Allen Harris for Jackalope Theatre Company’s Living Newspaper Festival and Queer Is Not Yet Here by Jorge Ignacio Cortiñas for Pivot Arts. Most recently, Susan directed a remake of Lope de Vega's Fuente Ovejuna, which she coadapted with playwright Kori Alston at Northwestern University, where she is an MFA candidate in directing.
RACHEL GREENHOE, co-producer. Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. She holds an MFA in Writing from Northwestern. She attended Sarah Lawrence College, where she studied playwriting with Sterling Spencer, Cassandra Medley and Lucy Thurber. Her play, ‘Not Retarded’, won the David Lindsay-Abaire award for playwriting and had a showcase performance the main stage. Two of her plays, ‘Not Retarded’ and ‘Tiger Trap’, have been produced in Off-Off Broadway showcases. Her latest play, ‘Monkey’, had its first reading at La Mama ETC. In addition to La Mama Rachel has worked with Mabou Mines, DTA, Fresh Fruit and Bass Films and interned with Motion picture Corporation of America and Nickelodeon. 
We also have an INCREDIBLE female-centric team of actors, designers, and more working on this project. We will give you more information about them & their work as the campaign continues!
Why Stix?
It's entertaining. It's fresh. It's relevant. Don't believe us?
Let's ask our team!
From the playwright, Molly Pease: ""I know a play about a talking Stick doesn't seem personal, but it feels relevant because it stems from many frustrations I have as a queer female artist today. There are so many ridiculously impossible expectations that we're suppose to meet! Sometimes it feels like a person could only meet those expectations if they were just an inanimate object that people could project their desires onto."" 
From our co-producer, Rachel Greenhoe: ""I personally love the theme of ‘ownership of stories’ in the play. In these days of easily shared media content, sometimes it feels like no one truly owns their stories.""
From creative team member, Oona O'Leary: ""It's creative, it's different, it's of the moment without being on the nose.""
Stix has also already had a staged reading at Northwestern University. What did they say about it?
Audience member: ""This is a dystopian play about American culture seen through the eyes of a stick. He is a total narcissist who is able to rise to power through pop culture. The arc of a celebrity rising to an influential position of power is particularly relevant right now. Overall, it’s a biting, witty play about wellness vs. American Capitalism.”

Speaking of Capitalism...
Currently we have a combined $6,000 in grants from Northwestern University and the Araca Project. However, that only covers 60% of our overall budget. Our ultimate goal is to raise the other 40% to complete a working  production of the show. 
Realistic Budget 
(based on past Araca Projects)

Wait, but why me?
Simple, with your donation, you can:

Compensate at least 13 hardworking, early career theatre artists. 
Get perky! Your donations give you the chance to receive awesome perks: handwritten post cards, original songs, tshirts, tote bags, dinner, and more! 
Help fund a professional showcase of multiple female artists who have been working their butts off for YEARS for the chance to work in a NYC production. 
Be a vital part of bringing new work to the NYC stages. 
Go on a weird, wonderful journey with characters who are hilarious yet oddly relatable and reflect on how society encourages us to commodify our personal tragedies. 
Make theater fun again.

Acá puedes leer un poco más sobre nuestro proyecto y sus creadores!</strong></p><p><strong>¿Quiénes somos?</strong></p><p>La Nueva Escena es un colectivo conformado por jóvenes creadores que se han interesado por traer a la escena cultural nuevas obras escenográficas, haciendo un énfasis inicial en la producción de ópera inédita en castellano, proyectos que aún buscan tener cabida en las agendas culturales de Colombia. La Nueva Escena es, también, una plataforma de creación para todas las exploraciones que se propongan cercanas al mundo de los escenarios.</p><p><strong>Who are we? </strong></p><p>La Nueva Escena is a group made up of young artists who have decided to bring new stage works into the cultural scene. All of this, making an initial emphasis in the production of new operas in spanish, a field still unexplored in the cultural agenda of Colombia. La Nueva Escena is also a creative platform for all art forms that are related to the stage.</p><p><strong>¿Qué es <i>Melpómene</i>?</strong></p><p>El primer proyecto del colectivo, Melpómene, drama lírico en un acto, busca presentar una propuesta de ópera de cámara en español, escrita para una sola intérprete con trío de piano, clarinete y violoncello. Compuesta por F. Hoyos González con base en el libreto del autor G. Galo, el drama propuesto por los autores explora el mito trágico de Melpómene, Musa regente de la tragedia, en reinterpretación contemporánea para crear un puente entre la tradición clásica y el malestar actual en la cultura, de donde se vale para crear la estructura narrativa que no hace mano del tradicional monólogo para la ópera de cámara, sino que, manteniendo una sola intérprete en escena, logra forjar dos personajes en un solo cuerpo. Se manifiesta, pues, como corresponde al género, un profundo trabajo de colaboración entre la literatura y la música, todo a su vez  enmarcado en el montaje teatral de la obra.</p><p><strong>What is <i>Melpómene</i>?</strong></p><p>The first project of the group, Melpómene, lyric drama in one act, is a chamber opera in spanish, composed for a single performer accompanied by a trio of piano, clarinet and violoncello. Composed by F. Hoyos Gonzalez and based on the a script by G. Galo, the drama explores the tragical myth of Melpómene, reining Muse of tragedy. The opera is a contemporary interpretation of the myth, all in the effort of creating a bridge between tradition and the current problems in society. This metaphorical bridge is represented by the lack of the typical monologue, but instead by maintaining a single person on the stage and creating two characters in one body. In this way, and as is expected of the genre, there is a profound collaboration between literature, music and theatre.</p><p><strong>¿Cuál es la importancia de este proyecto?</strong></p><p>El teatro y la música, ámbitos muy fuerte en la industria cultural, no siempre da lugar a nuevas producciones de ópera joven. Este proyecto parece oportuno para abrir nuevos espacios para nuevos públicos donde continúe la exploración del canto, el texto y las artes escénicas, dándole esa mayor presencia que acaso amerite en los escenarios y espacios académicos de Colombia.

That´s why La Nueva Escena (The New Stage), a team of young artists, has decided to bring an original production of this genre to the Latin American stages. Join us!Thanks for watching our video! Here you can learn more about this project and its creators!¡Gracias por ver nuestro video! Acá puedes leer un poco más sobre nuestro proyecto y sus creadores!¿Quiénes somos?La Nueva Escena es un colectivo conformado por jóvenes creadores que se han interesado por traer a la escena cultural nuevas obras escenográficas, haciendo un énfasis inicial en la producción de ópera inédita en castellano, proyectos que aún buscan tener cabida en las agendas culturales de Colombia. La Nueva Escena es, también, una plataforma de creación para todas las exploraciones que se propongan cercanas al mundo de los escenarios.Who are we? La Nueva Escena is a group made up of young artists who have decided to bring new stage works into the cultural scene. All of this, making an initial emphasis in the production of new operas in spanish, a field still unexplored in the cultural agenda of Colombia. La Nueva Escena is also a creative platform for all art forms that are related to the stage.¿Qué es Melpómene?El primer proyecto del colectivo, Melpómene, drama lírico en un acto, busca presentar una propuesta de ópera de cámara en español, escrita para una sola intérprete con trío de piano, clarinete y violoncello. Compuesta por F. Hoyos González con base en el libreto del autor G. Galo, el drama propuesto por los autores explora el mito trágico de Melpómene, Musa regente de la tragedia, en reinterpretación contemporánea para crear un puente entre la tradición clásica y el malestar actual en la cultura, de donde se vale para crear la estructura narrativa que no hace mano del tradicional monólogo para la ópera de cámara, sino que, manteniendo una sola intérprete en escena, logra forjar dos personajes en un solo cuerpo. Se manifiesta, pues, como corresponde al género, un profundo trabajo de colaboración entre la literatura y la música, todo a su vez  enmarcado en el montaje teatral de la obra.What is Melpómene?The first project of the group, Melpómene, lyric drama in one act, is a chamber opera in spanish, composed for a single performer accompanied by a trio of piano, clarinet and violoncello. Composed by F. Hoyos Gonzalez and based on the a script by G. Galo, the drama explores the tragical myth of Melpómene, reining Muse of tragedy. The opera is a contemporary interpretation of the myth, all in the effort of creating a bridge between tradition and the current problems in society. This metaphorical bridge is represented by the lack of the typical monologue, but instead by maintaining a single person on the stage and creating two characters in one body. In this way, and as is expected of the genre, there is a profound collaboration between literature, music and theatre.¿Cuál es la importancia de este proyecto?El teatro y la música, ámbitos muy fuerte en la industria cultural, no siempre da lugar a nuevas producciones de ópera joven. Este proyecto parece oportuno para abrir nuevos espacios para nuevos públicos donde continúe la exploración del canto, el texto y las artes escénicas, dándole esa mayor presencia que acaso amerite en los escenarios y espacios académicos de Colombia. No solo nos acercaremos a los espectadores, sino que nos importa crear un acceso a una nueva plataforma de creación que se propone estar abierta para aquellos artistas (estudiantes y profesionales) que quieran incursionar en la interdisciplinariedad de las áreas tan variadas que la ópera esencialmente reúne como la puesta en escena, la actuación, la dramaturgia y la poesía, la música y el canto.What is the importance of this project?Music and theatre, strong fields in cultural industry, are not often associated with productions of new opera.

<p>Trolley Dances Riverside is a production that offers choreographers a platform to create original, site-specific work along the local bus route. The dances take place in public spaces and bring attention to the special attributes of the city. An opportunity like this one is rare in Riverside in that it bridges community dancers from local colleges and dance studios and provides a professional performance opportunity. Trolley Dances Riverside is a production of Riverside City College Dance, P.L.A.C.E. Performance, and the Riverside Arts Council, in partnership with the Riverside Transit Agency. Trolley Dances is a trademarked event of Jean Isaacs San Diego Dance Theater and is celebrating 20 years in that city. This unique dance performance also happens in San Francisco. Although the topography, diversity, and culture of each city may differ, each location retains the original idea of creating site-specific work along the public transportation line and has attracted over 3000 patrons throughout the state each year. We are extremely excited to offer honorariums for dance artists involved in Trolley Dances Riverside. This year's talented line-up of choreographers includes Jay Carlon, Megan Fowler-Hurst, Primera Generación Dance Collective, Wade Madsen, and Julie Simon. Support the project and help us reach our goal! If you are unable to contribute at this time, you can help us out by spreading the word about the fundraiser. Hope to see you at the event on October 13th!</p>

<p>In 1995, 739 people died in Chicago when they didn’t have

themselves in tenements and transient hotels. Their killer was just as
invisible. For five days temperatures hovered above 100 degrees with heat
indices as high as 120. As the city morgues overflowed, the effectiveness of
the city’s emergency response system came into question and Mayor Daley’s team
snapped into action. But instead of attacking the problem, they attacked the
victims with a PR campaign that successfully absolved the city of any
wrongdoing and blamed the dead and their families for the fatalities.  </p>

<br/><p>Director's notes: </p>
<p><i>This project began as a single image: Lady Macbeth obsessively scrubbing her hands with a wire scrubbing brush, making more blood with every desperate attempt to get clean. The futility and vulnerability of this cracking mind fuelled by this insatiable inner fire really spoke to me. She was so beautiful that I became a little obsessed and I thought: Macbeth is mad by the end of the play, so why can't Lady M and Banquo both be ghosts? Obsessions? The unrecognized beginning of his madness?</i></p>
<p><i>The idea kept tugging at me and as I grappled with my own inner demons, anxiety, depression and the occasionally brush with insanity, directing Macbeth became an inevitable step.</i></p>
<p><i>When I finally went back to the script I was worried I'd have to significantly change the text to fit this concept, but the more I read, the more it all made sense! </i></p>
<p><i>Between mining the script for clues and my own  tortured experiences, it all just came together: </i><i>Lady Macbeth and Banquo emerged as constructs that Macbeth's mind had created to help him deal with his fear, isolation and guilt. They keep on path in Act One and Two. It's only when he stops listening to their guidance that his world starts to fall apart. </i></p>
<p><i>The witches have been really fun too, as orchestrators of the action, they appear as minor characters throughout the play, keeping an eye on things, providing a nudge here and there as necessary, and a few similar characters have merged together, gathering this whole new internal life. </i></p>
<p><i>Aside from the Macbeth Triumvirate the biggest conceptual discovery was casting Malcolm and Donalbain as women. King Lear is another favourite of mine, so when I was casting and we had more talented women than female characters it seemed like such a neat idea to mirror Lear's daughters in Duncan's offspring, even if there are only two. But then I reread Act 4 Scene 3 and suddenly the relationship between Macduff and Malcolm is the perfect counterpoint to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth! There are so many parallels between these two strong couples, it has balanced the play in a really exciting new way.</i></p>
<p><i>I can't wait to share this world we've built together with an audience. It's dark and tortured and messy but in a way it feels really compassionate. We're all hurting. We do things we regret. Sometimes we can pull ourselves back form those choices and sometimes we can't. I hope this play really opens up compassion in people for others and for themselves as we all struggle against the madness lurking in our own souls.""</i></p>

We're working towards a sustainable business model that includes a performance arts school that feeds into the professional company so we'll be entirely self-sufficient, but we need a bit of help getting that going.More about Crooked Teeth's Macbeth. . .This is Crooked Teeth Theatre's third theatrical production, but the momentum that Macbeth is building has brought us up to the cusp of something really special.
Director's notes: 
This project began as a single image: Lady Macbeth obsessively scrubbing her hands with a wire scrubbing brush, making more blood with every desperate attempt to get clean. The futility and vulnerability of this cracking mind fuelled by this insatiable inner fire really spoke to me. She was so beautiful that I became a little obsessed and I thought: Macbeth is mad by the end of the play, so why can't Lady M and Banquo both be ghosts? Obsessions? The unrecognized beginning of his madness?
The idea kept tugging at me and as I grappled with my own inner demons, anxiety, depression and the occasionally brush with insanity, directing Macbeth became an inevitable step.
When I finally went back to the script I was worried I'd have to significantly change the text to fit this concept, but the more I read, the more it all made sense! 
Between mining the script for clues and my own  tortured experiences, it all just came together: Lady Macbeth and Banquo emerged as constructs that Macbeth's mind had created to help him deal with his fear, isolation and guilt. They keep on path in Act One and Two. It's only when he stops listening to their guidance that his world starts to fall apart. 
The witches have been really fun too, as orchestrators of the action, they appear as minor characters throughout the play, keeping an eye on things, providing a nudge here and there as necessary, and a few similar characters have merged together, gathering this whole new internal life. 
Aside from the Macbeth Triumvirate the biggest conceptual discovery was casting Malcolm and Donalbain as women. King Lear is another favourite of mine, so when I was casting and we had more talented women than female characters it seemed like such a neat idea to mirror Lear's daughters in Duncan's offspring, even if there are only two. But then I reread Act 4 Scene 3 and suddenly the relationship between Macduff and Malcolm is the perfect counterpoint to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth! There are so many parallels between these two strong couples, it has balanced the play in a really exciting new way.
I can't wait to share this world we've built together with an audience. It's dark and tortured and messy but in a way it feels really compassionate. We're all hurting. We do things we regret. Sometimes we can pull ourselves back form those choices and sometimes we can't. I hope this play really opens up compassion in people for others and for themselves as we all struggle against the madness lurking in our own souls.""",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Greetings!</b>  We are Ahkai Franklin and Garrett “Spaghetti” Minniti, Co-Founders and Artistic Directors of <i>The Breakthrough Outreach &amp; Performance Not-For-Profit Corporation</i> aka <i>The Breakthrough Movement</i>.  We are back in our SECOND Indiegogo campaign, dedicated to completing the funding for <i>The Breakthrough Movement</i> in New York City.</p>
<p>Company members and apprentices, from 2 countries, 3 Canadian provinces, and 9 states, are currently in the Big Apple coming together for the first time as a full-fledged dance company to develop their repertoire. These dancers, carefully selected based on their talent and abilities as well as their own personal stories, all bring something that is unique to <i>The Breakthrough</i>.  It is a group of dancers that we believe in and want to see break through their own barriers in order to succeed and grow in this industry, just as we have in our own careers.</p>
<p>We would like to take the moment to say that we are beyond grateful for having received the support that we did in our first campaign! Our funders' belief in our vision and dedication to this group of young and talented dancers has not gone unnoticed. We are filled with gratitude that our passion is being recognized as we navigate our way to breakthrough any and all obstacles we come across.  That is where our campaign 2.0 comes in.</p>
<p>This new campaign was created in order to cover the bare minimum of our remaining expenses for the month of July, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>rehearsal and performance spaces</li>
<li>teacher salaries</li>
<li>traveling and living expenses</li>
</ul><p>We have gotten this far thanks to YOU, but now we need your help to reach our end goal, which is the opportunity for this group to debut our first production of original work on a New York City stage. Every tax-deductible donation of any amount will help us to achieve this goal.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In the summer of 2006, Ahkai and Garrett met dancing for <i>Sybarite Artist Development Collective</i> (<i>SADC</i>), and although we came from very different backgrounds, our common passion, energy, and commitment to our artform drew us together.  Soon after, we fused our styles and experiences to create innovative works of theatre and dance in numerous venues in and around NYC.  To date, we have produced over 30 events, workshops, intensives, festivals, choreography showcases, and original Off-Broadway productions, all of which have been focused around the idea of creating a community of like-minded artists by creating new connections and bridging the gap between passion and opportunity.</p><blockquote>""Our initial intention when creating our first production was to create opportunity for ourselves, our friends, and our students.  Making a career in this industry is just plain hard.  After we got through the process, we realized that we produced something more than just a show.  We had found our voice.  We created a way of saying, ‘THIS is my dream, and I AM going after it,’ and we built the foundation of a community to help support achieving those dreams."" <span style=""font-style: normal;"">- Garrett “Spaghetti” Minniti &amp; Ahkai Franklin (2007)</span>
</blockquote><p>Over the past seven years, we have come to realize how serious the need is for creating community, not only within our industry, but also in our families, our children and students, our local communities, and even in our international relations and world view.  We have also discovered that our vision extends much further than just pushing the boundaries of our craft, and what we want to say with our art is more focused than simply preaching the message of defining what your ‘it’ is of being ""in it for life.""  As Agnes de Mille said, “The truest expression of people is in its dance and in its music.”  After seven years of creating and dancing together our ""truest expression,"" like dance, is a <i>movement</i>.  Something that we call <i>The Breakthrough</i>.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It's incredible and inspiring to us that in less than a year <i>The Breakthrough Movement</i> has more than tripled in size, going from seven to thirty company members and apprentices.  But more importantly than the size of the army, is the conviction with which they fight.  Twelve company members (not local to New York), five of them for the second time, have paid the cost of their flights in order to join <i>The Movement</i>.  Working with a group of people who believe in our vision with such faith is exactly the motivation we need as directors and the very reason why <i>The Breakthrough Movement</i> will be known around the world!</p><p>We are campaigning for $8,750.00. This is the minimum that we require in order to secure all of the necessary elements for our current project.  These funds will be used for:</p><ul>
<li>Rehearsal and performance space for the remaining two weeks.</li>
<li>Salaries for the six dance instructors involved in our program.</li>
<li>Living and transportation expenses for our Company members.</li>
</ul><p>*<i>The Breakthrough Movement</i> has been operating as a Not-for-Profit entity since September of 2013.  We are waiting to receive our official 501(c)3 status from the IRS, but we have received our Tax ID Number and therefore will provide you with  tax-deductible receipt for your donation.</p>
<p>In return for your donations we are offering social media shout outs, crazy donation dancing, awesome LIFE Gear, private dance instruction, Flash Mob-o-grams (see what we did there?), sponsorship packages, and exclusive meet and greets with the company.  We will even create a piece of choreography inspired by YOU and YOUR story!  PLEASE check out our FULL list of perks stage right.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We can't change the world alone. Each donation to our campaign is an open declaration of joining <i>The Movement</i>!</p>
<p>This project aims to develop what we anticipate being one of the most talented and dedicated dance companies in the business, showcasing original work on a consistent basis, eventually performing our own production on a Broadway stage, and traveling to spread the message that created them - which is in big bold letters under our video. By the end of this month, <i>The Breakthrough</i> will have workshopped our greatest theatrical work, allowing us to move into the next stage of production.</p><p>The general public will not only receive an entertaining, feel-good experience, but they will also be inspired by the thought-provoking message that <i>The Breakthrough</i> will offer.  The content that <i>The Breakthrough</i> presents will be artistically created in such a way as to question common social barriers that exist in our society.  The goal for those who attend our performances and participate in our outreach programs and philanthropy is to achieve a level of social awareness and self-reflection that would motivate them to reach their full potential and, in turn, make them a source of inspiration within their own communities. #JoinTheMovement</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We understand the challenge of running a weeklong campaign for our dance company's current project.  We, our dancers, and all of those involved have invested into this company's success and have used all available resources and finances. Our dancers have flown to New York City and put everything else on hold to be a part of this experience. We have also extended ourselves financially, physically, and emotionally in order to make this happen and get our dancers to where they are now. We see this as a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. As with anything in life, there are challenges, but this project is the beginning of a track that will eventually get our <i>Breakthrough</i> dancers traveling around the world and performing on a Broadway stage for our own, original show. This is the first step we need to take in order to progress and get closer to making our dream a reality.</p>
<h3><b>Before You Go</b></h3><b>
</b><p>We want to say <b>THANK YOU</b> for taking the time to learn about who we are and our campaign!  If you are reading this, you either know one of us personally and/or professionally or have been asked to learn about us and our campaign through family, friends, and/or social media.

</div></div>","Now Harlem... OR GENTRIFY THIS ""The Play""
When Rita, a young white poet, moves to a gentrifying uptown block, her black neighbor Joanne, who often goes by the name ""Harlem"" exclaims, ""Your being here is like another Applebee's we don't need."" In a slam poetry type of showdown, Harlem is forced to choose between the cause she believes in and an answered prayer. Written for a society masked by centuries of pain, Now Harlem... OR GENTRIFY THIS! 





The Story 
Performer and playwright Latonia Phipps, derived inspiration for this project after moving to Harlem. In relocating, Phipps noticed that the Harlem of today was not the same beloved Harlem she grew up with. This left her to wonder, ""What happened to the Harlem I read about in my history books?"" Her experiences and questions became Now Harlem... OR GENTRIFY THIS! This production first premiered on July 10th, 2104 at University Settlement after Phipps was offered the opportunity to be apart of an Artist in Residence program. This piece had such a great impact on the L.E.S community Phipps decided to bring this show back to where it originated... HARLEM. 


WHAT WE NEED
To cover production fees as well as stationary costs for press packages presented to interested theaters companies.

Musicians (2)               $680
Light/media                $700
Actors                           $825



50 for 50 (Harlem Based Organizations)
Set up to bridge the gap between local organizations and the Harlem community. We need 50 Harlem based companies to make a $50 tax-deductible donation to help sponsor this project. In exchange we will feature your logo and company name on all of our social media outlets as well as a mention in the program for our next show.  




The Impact

This production experienced three nights of successful talk backs and a packed audience which included Harlem and L.E.S residence, local artist, housing representatives and community board members. What we learned....


Gentrification has happened and is happening.
People can empower themselves by being apart of their community boards.
Artist have a huge impact on this change and can help by using their gifts to keep this conversation going.



No Money... We still need YOU.

<p></p>
We are theatre geeks. Technology nerds. We are actors, musicians, designers, writers, photographers, lovers of the arts. And people who are passionate about forming a global theatre community. <br/><p></p>
<p>We put our heads together, met with our friends at Google, got hopped up on sugar (thanks to their delicious <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/lf2OCXi5im/?modal=true"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interoffice snack bar</a>) and came up with the idea for an All Star Benefit Concert &amp; Hangout that would bring together theatre lovers from around the world for a livestreamed, interactive Hangout with Broadway.</p>
<p>And, because this concert is all about community, we decided to use the opportunity to give back to <i>our </i>community. The proceeds of the Give Back Concert benefit the Crime Victims Treatment Center.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><a name=""cvtc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Why it Matters<br/></a></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Approximately 1 out of every 6 people are victims of violent crime. </p>
<p>That's a crazy number. Think about your Facebook page - if you're like most people, you have about 300 friends. That means at least 50 
people you love are likely to have experienced violent crime and needed help last year.
</p>
<p>The CVTC has been turning terrible events into incredible stories of 
hope and survival for almost 40 years. In New York, they offer FREE 
trauma-focused therapy, support and services to survivors. And for those of you in 
other cities, it's pretty likely that the center in your town was 
modeled, in some way, after this groundbreaking organization. They 
continue to go out into other communities to help improve the way we 
support survivors of violent crime.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through this concert, we have raised almost $90,000 for the CVTC over the past three years. We have the chance to blow this amount out of the water with the #buGIVEBACK concert this year. <br/></p>
<p><b>And that's good, because at
the end of July, CVTC was notified that its public funding would be cut by 46%
beginning October 1, 2014.  </b><span><b>This news was sudden and completely unexpected.  If CVTC is unable
to find these funds elsewhere it will mean the collapse of New York State’s
leading victim services program. </b><br/></span></p>
<p><span>This has always been an important event for the CVTC - but this year, things got really real. And it's up to us to step up to the plate.<br/></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><a name=""help"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">We Need You<br/></a></h3>We took a look at the budget from last year and determined that we need $10,000 to cover the cost of the Greene Space and incidental 
costs- so that everything else we raise goes straight to the CVTC. Totally doable, right? In fact, that's only 400 people donating the minimum amount to get a seat on the Hangout. <br/><br/>Pshaw.<br/><br/><em>We can do better than that. Plus, anything </em>we raise beyond the cost of the concert will go 
straight to the Crime Victims Treatment Center. So, even though we set our goal at $10,000, we want to raise $25,000. Or $50,000. Or a BAJILLION dollars. And before you go telling us there's no such thing as a Bajillion, we will kindly remind you that most of us have a BFA in Musical Theatre and haven't had a math class for a loooong time. So, we're feeling confident that a BAJILLION is possible. <br/><br/>It's a pretty cool idea 
-  we can create a really exciting event for ourselves to enjoy AND make
 the world a better place. Nice. <ul>
<br/><br/>
</ul>
<h3><a name=""difference"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You Make a Difference<br/></a></h3>
<p>The #buGIVEBACK Concert is the only source of non-restricted funding for the CVTC. So in addition to saving them from the funding crisis and helping keep one of the most important survivor services programs from going under (oh, just that), we'll also be providing money that can be used to do things like:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>Continue to fund the CVTC
Volunteer Rape Crisis and Domestic Violence Emergency Room Advocate Program,
making sure survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence receive
compassionate and knowledgeable care and support in the ER</li></ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>Provide integral
non-restricted emergency funds to survivors. Last year’s funds helped purchase
furniture for a woman and her two toddlers who had escaped a life-threatening
partner and found a safe apartment of their own, clothing for rape survivors
whose clothing must be kept for evidence, emergency transportation for people
fleeing abusive partners, and many other necessary things to which survivors
normally have limited or no access</li></ul>
<p>As we mentioned before, we have three successful years of concerts under our belt, with almost $90,000 raised for the CVTC. That's not bragging, that's just making sure that you know the money goes where we say it's going, and that you can be sure your contribution will make a difference. <br/></p>

Live from NYC, in real time!7:30pm EST • Monday November 3, 2014

Once a year, Broadway Unlocked throws the party to end all parties - the #buGIVEBACK concert. It's Broadway's first global Google Hangout and All Star Benefit Concert - which means no matter who you are or where you live, you can be a part of Broadway during the show. 

But, what does all that really mean, exactly? 
First: It means we're putting on a Broadway concert, 
live from New York with these amazing performers and writers:





Second: We livestream it through YouTube, as a giant 
Google Hangout - which means, if you're watching, you'll see something like this: 


Third: We do fun things like have real time Q&A's, play games and feature 
fans from around the world through the Hangout. Also, there's belting. Lots of belting. And, this one's a benefit concert which means the proceeds are donated 
to an incredible organization that we love - called the Crime Victims

<h2><em><strong>QUAKE: A Love Story</strong></em></h2>
<p>We were accepted to the New York International Fringe Festival!!!!!</p>
<p>It's Aug. 9-25, 2013, and we need your help getting there from Orlando, FL. We're gonna kick some Big Apple butt, but we can't do it alone!</p>
<h3><strong>About <em>QUAKE</em></strong></h3>
<p>Here’s the SparkNotes version of our play!</p>
<p>Joe and Hannah have been married for a while - married just out of high school - and they can't seem to make it work.</p>
<p>With no clear answer, they decide to try and go their separate ways.</p>
<p>While splitting up their belongings in a utility closet full of junk, Joe and Hannah find themselves face to face with fate when an earthquake hits, trapping them inside.  Over the following days, without food, water, or a bathroom ... Joe and Hannah panic, fight, play games, sing songs and do whatever they have to in order to survive the present, their past, and each other.</p>
<p>Taking place entirely within the confines of a utility closet, this two-person tour-de-force is a must-see at this year's Fringe. Full of music, physical comedy, and high drama, <em>QUAKE</em> is a production you won't want to miss.</p>
<p>Premiering at the Humboldt County Acata Theater in 2010, <em>QUAKE</em> went on to sweep the stages of the Minnesota, San Francisco, and Berkshire Fringe Festivals.

<h3><strong>Why We Need Your Help!<br/></strong></h3>
<p>We love this play. After having it passed to us from its creators, we knew this was a story that needed to be told. We think it’s a perfect fringe festival show: honest, intimate, and funny.</p>
<p>We submitted our proposal to the New York International Fringe Festival and we've been accepted! We are now in the process of putting together the next step of the <em>QUAKE</em> Tour, and we need your help in making it to NYC.</p>
<p>Your contribution to our campaign will allow us to take our production to New York. After having played successfully in Arcata, San Francisco, Minnesota, and most recently in Cincinnati, the next step is the Big Apple.</p>
<p>We need your generosity so that our production can afford the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>NYC Fringe Registration Fee</strong> - (Expensive!!!)</li>
<li>
<strong>Set </strong>- The play is set in a closet, so the required set is pretty minimal, but we need pieces capable of being broken down into small enough bits to travel to NYC and being stored in a very small section of the theatre.</li>
<li>
<strong>Props </strong>- Some of our props can be found in our own closets; but we need a dozen or so props that require purchase as they will be destroyed or consumed during the show! So we don't want to borrow your stuff ... cause you won't get it back!</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing </strong>- We're putting this bad boy up in NYC, so we need as much marketing material as we can get our hands on! A producer in NYC once told me that if you're doing a show up there you need to spend half your budget on marketing ... We're not going to use half, but we need to be able to get the word out! And that's going to cost us some pretty serious dough.</li>
<li>
<strong>Travel </strong>- Your contribution will also literally help us get to NYC. We're going to be hauling a set, actors, lights, props, and a whole lot of awesomeness to New York, and your donation will help us afford gas, trailer, parking, and travel expenses.</li>
<li>
<strong>Anything Left Over </strong>- Ha! As you know, there are always expenses that come up unexpectedly. if we are able to fully fund our production and have any kind of money left over from our fundraising, the remaining funds will be spent on last ditch marketing efforts such as extra flyers and posters, venue tip for the amazing theatre techs who help us in our venue in NYC, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What Do You Get in Return for Your Awesomeness?!</strong></h3>
<p>We're going to send you something to remember our production and how valuable your contribution was to us achieving our goal!</p>
<p>Rehearsal photos, flyers autographed by the actors, posters autographed by the entire artistic team, photos of the production in NYC, and tickets to the show -- we've got plenty of snail-mail-worthy perks!</p>
<h2>Thank You!!!</h2>
<p>We are soooooo super excited to take this beautiful play to its next incarnation in New York City. Please consider helping us out, whether it's through a donation, by sharing our IndieGoGo on your Facebook page, or by spreading the word to your friends. We appreciate every dollar, and we can't do it without your help! :)</p>

We were accepted to the New York International Fringe Festival!!!!!
It's Aug. 9-25, 2013, and we need your help getting there from Orlando, FL. We're gonna kick some Big Apple butt, but we can't do it alone!
About QUAKE
Here’s the SparkNotes version of our play!
Joe and Hannah have been married for a while - married just out of high school - and they can't seem to make it work.
With no clear answer, they decide to try and go their separate ways.
While splitting up their belongings in a utility closet full of junk, Joe and Hannah find themselves face to face with fate when an earthquake hits, trapping them inside.  Over the following days, without food, water, or a bathroom ... Joe and Hannah panic, fight, play games, sing songs and do whatever they have to in order to survive the present, their past, and each other.
Taking place entirely within the confines of a utility closet, this two-person tour-de-force is a must-see at this year's Fringe. Full of music, physical comedy, and high drama, QUAKE is a production you won't want to miss.
Premiering at the Humboldt County Acata Theater in 2010, QUAKE went on to sweep the stages of the Minnesota, San Francisco, and Berkshire Fringe Festivals. These initial productions were performed by the playwright, Tyler Olsen, and Zuzka Sabata. After that, Justin Baldwin and Lara Miller obtained the rights and had a successful run at the Cincinnati Fringe Festival in 2012, receiving three Cincinnati/Dayton, OH Broadway World Award nominations (including Best Play and Acting nominations for both Justin and Lara).
Here's what some writerly people have said about QUAKE so far:
""QUAKE is well-done: a bittersweet story about realizing very important things at the worst possible moment, but also, before it’s too late. And in a very small space.""- Harper Lee, CityBeat
""… a funny, poetic, poignant, and visceral experience.""- Michael Fields, Dell'Arte International""astonishing and heartening ...""- William Kowinski, Eureka Times-Standard""A gem!""- David Ferney, Arcata Playhouse

arts company specializing in performance and education under the direction of
Emmy and Travis Moon. Iluminar strives to move aerial dance into a respected
and recognized dance genre by combining technical dance into the vertical
space. Our goal as a company is to increase the recognition of the aerial and circus arts across the globe but especially in the United States. We want anyone and everyone to experience the joy of the circus world, either by taking a class with us or enjoying our performances as audience members. </p>
<p>Iluminar Aerial provides aerial and circus
classes for kids and adults at their Broomfield studio and at various schools around the Denver and Boulder area. Iluminar produces five annual shows per season with their professional core company and their youth performance company. Iluminar also provides a wide range of circus entertainment for a variety of events around the United States including aerial acrobatics, stilt walking, juggling, fire dancing, acrobatics and gymnastics. </p><p><b>Our Campaign</b></p>
<p>Our campaign’s goal
is to raise enough money to provide the financial assistance to our company
members to be able to travel to Ireland for a week in the summer of 2014.  Fidget Feet Aerial hosts the Irish Aerial Dance
Festival every year in Letterkenny, Co. Donegal.  This festival provides a medium for some of
the most talented people in the aerial circus community to teach classes in
cutting edge techniques and forms.  The
festival also provides companies attending the opportunity to bring pieces to
Ireland to perform for the festival, which Iluminar is planning to do.</p>
<p>In a world that is
too quick to disregard the arts as frivolous, we dedicate our lives to maintain
a sense of grace and beauty in this often dark world.  Helping to send us to as beautiful a place as
Ireland to learn what we love from people we respect will mean more to us than
we can ever possibly communicate to you.</p>
<p>Helping us achieve
our funding goal will provide a once in a lifetime opportunity for our company
members to experience our art form in a new and inspirational country.  Traveling overseas is quite expensive, and many
of our company members work 2, 3 or even 4 jobs to be able to pursue their art
form that they love so much.</p>
<p>At current prices, a
round trip flight from Denver, CO to Dublin, Ireland costs about
$900-$1000.  From there, we will be
traveling by bus to the northern part of County Donegal.  Lodging in Letterkenny for aerialists
attending the festival ranges anywhere from $45 to $110 a
night.  We will also have to fend for
ourselves in a foreign land for food, which we are all rather looking forward
to.</p>
<p>As far as the
fundraising campaign is concerned, the minimum amount we are hoping to raise
will help provide transportation from the States to Ireland and back.  Anything more than that and we will hopefully
be able to provide lodging and some meals to our members.</p><p>If you can't contribute financially, we understand completely.  Good news is that you can still help!  Please share this on Facebook, Twitter, and every other social media you can find!  Help us get the word out so we can continue to be a thriving member of the wonderful contemporary aerial and circus world!</p>

arts company specializing in performance and education under the direction of
Emmy and Travis Moon. Iluminar strives to move aerial dance into a respected
and recognized dance genre by combining technical dance into the vertical
space. Our goal as a company is to increase the recognition of the aerial and circus arts across the globe but especially in the United States. We want anyone and everyone to experience the joy of the circus world, either by taking a class with us or enjoying our performances as audience members. 
Iluminar Aerial provides aerial and circus
classes for kids and adults at their Broomfield studio and at various schools around the Denver and Boulder area. Iluminar produces five annual shows per season with their professional core company and their youth performance company. Iluminar also provides a wide range of circus entertainment for a variety of events around the United States including aerial acrobatics, stilt walking, juggling, fire dancing, acrobatics and gymnastics. Our Campaign
Our campaign’s goal
is to raise enough money to provide the financial assistance to our company
members to be able to travel to Ireland for a week in the summer of 2014.  Fidget Feet Aerial hosts the Irish Aerial Dance
Festival every year in Letterkenny, Co. Donegal.  This festival provides a medium for some of
the most talented people in the aerial circus community to teach classes in
cutting edge techniques and forms.  The
festival also provides companies attending the opportunity to bring pieces to
Ireland to perform for the festival, which Iluminar is planning to do.
In a world that is
too quick to disregard the arts as frivolous, we dedicate our lives to maintain
a sense of grace and beauty in this often dark world.  Helping to send us to as beautiful a place as
Ireland to learn what we love from people we respect will mean more to us than
we can ever possibly communicate to you.
Helping us achieve
our funding goal will provide a once in a lifetime opportunity for our company
members to experience our art form in a new and inspirational country.  Traveling overseas is quite expensive, and many
of our company members work 2, 3 or even 4 jobs to be able to pursue their art
form that they love so much.
At current prices, a
round trip flight from Denver, CO to Dublin, Ireland costs about
$900-$1000.  From there, we will be
traveling by bus to the northern part of County Donegal.  Lodging in Letterkenny for aerialists
attending the festival ranges anywhere from $45 to $110 a
night.  We will also have to fend for
ourselves in a foreign land for food, which we are all rather looking forward
to.
As far as the
fundraising campaign is concerned, the minimum amount we are hoping to raise
will help provide transportation from the States to Ireland and back.  Anything more than that and we will hopefully
be able to provide lodging and some meals to our members.If you can't contribute financially, we understand completely.  Good news is that you can still help!  Please share this on Facebook, Twitter, and every other social media you can find!  Help us get the word out so we can continue to be a thriving member of the wonderful contemporary aerial and circus world!

INITIAL FEE= $3,000
Fee is accessed for new members of union to obtain Union Rights/Contracts

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Margie Timmons is a state award winning drama teacher, whose high school kids consistently win superiors at local, district, and state drama competitions, without even having an actual theatre at Gulf Breeze High School ! She inspires her kids to not only be wonderful actors/thespians, but to be incredible human beings. The kids that have auditioned for the Spring Musical, ""The Drowsy Chaperone"", have been told they have to raise the entire cost of the production, because there is no school system funding for ""the Arts"". They have to rent a local theatre at Pensacola State College, pay for the rights to the production, costumes, the orchestra, technical assistance at the theatre, printing costs, set building costs, and more. There were many kids who were selected to be in the show, who ultimately could not participate because of the enormous financial expectations each student has to raise. Please help these talented teenagers raise the money to put on this production, so that more teens will be able to participate in the show!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Without any outside funding, each child is expected to pay @175 each, just to participate in the show, plus an additional $150 in ad sales, and another $225 in ticket sales. There are many families who simply cannot raise this kind of money, and so their kids will get left out. If we can raise it from the online community, these kids will all get a chance to be in the show!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Throughout the years 2009 and 2010, dozens of new
playwrights have submitted their original scripts to Mildred’s Umbrella Theater
Company. Due to our small budget, and the long list of projects we’ve been
wanting to bring to Houston audiences, we haven’t been able to produce as many
of these fabulous plays as we would like, but we have narrowed the scripts down
to four new plays that fit the edginess of Mildred’s Umbrella’s unique
aesthetic. Any of these plays would be a treat for Houston audiences, but we
can only produce one of them. We plan to let our audience help us decide. <br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In the 2011-2012 season, we have scheduled four staged
readings, one for each of the plays. These readings will be open to the public,
and advertised the same as any show we produce. They will be directed by seasoned directors, and cast with the highest quality actors, and the
performances will be ‘pay as you like. We will host a talk-back after the performance in
which audience members can interact with the cast and director (and in most
cases, the playwright as well), and we will also have a survey for the audience
to fill out if they desire to participate. There will be a panel of experts at
all the readings as well (Experienced playwrights, writing professors, theatre
directors) to give additional feedback. <br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The readings will take place in August 2011, October 2011,
January 2012 and April 2012. From the readings and feedback, a play will be
chosen for a world premier production in the 2012-2013 season. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<h3></h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The playwrights we’ve selected are from all over the US, and
we will market the readings and production to all relevant areas to promote
tourism into Houston from Texas and beyond.This will allow the audiences of the Houston Theatre scene to show their favorite little indy theatre what kind of show they want to see. It will also allow our fair city to witness four world premiers before any other city, and one full world premier production. <br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We need to raise $3000 to bring in the playwrights and put them up, to pay the actors and directors for their amazing work, to pay for the performance spaces... this way we can allow everyone to come and hear the readings for free, especially those who cannot afford to pay, such as students from local colleges and high schools who would like to experience this cutting edge work.<br/>

<p>I am Mariana Moraes.  I am a 23 year old pre-professional dancer from Belem/PA, Brazil. </p>
<p><span>I started dancing ballet when I was six years old in a small ballet school in my city.  My mother was a ballerina and she was my inspiration to start this amazing journey. </span></p>
<p>For ten years, I participated in many festivals around Brazil.  That was my life: studying at school, and spending my free time dancing.

<p>A big “BOOM” happened to me then; I was nearly depressed and so I decided to stop going to university and I decided to run after my life's dream.  In 2011, I started to dedicate my life to dance again.  I decided to be happy no matter how much I was going to get from dance, or if I was even going to get anything at all.  </p>
<p><span>But of course, it wasn’t easy.  At first, my family and friends didn’t understand what was happening.  Eventually I received support from a few people around me, and the most important support that I had was my mother who had always believed in my talent.</span></p>
<p>In July, 2011, I went to Parauapebas to visit my mother, and, by coincidence, a small dance festival was happening at the same time.  It was here that I met one of the most important people in my life that is making me write this story, Monica Proenca.  I took classes with her for three days.  When I was introduced to contemporary and modern dance, I became extremely interested.  Soon after, I was invited by Monica Proenca {a director alongside Davi Rodrigues and Lara Barclay}, to go to Vancouver, Canada, and be a part of Lamondance, a pre-professional dance training company. </p>
<p>In January  2011, I finally arrived in Vancouver.  I couldn’t believe that it was really happening!  My small dream was starting to come true, and be bigger that I had ever thought.  Getting there was already one of the hardest challenges in my life.  Being and living there was the challenge; I was far away from my friends and family, trying to deal with language and cultural differences between Canada and Brazil, but I knew that I couldn’t give up; this was my opportunity to be a professional dancer.  The classes, creative process, and rehearsals with Lamondance were incredibly intense, but I loved every single second of it.  For a year and a half I danced with Lamondance, and during that time I grew up as a dancer and, more importantly, as a human being.  I had amazing experiences, I learned English, I made friends, and Vancouver became my home.</p>
<p>But again, this was all possible because of one person in the world --- my mother.  She helped me with money, and she paid for everything by herself, but she can not help me anymore.  I still have the opportunity to go back to Canada and keep going with my dream, and go even further, but unfortunately I can not do this alone in the short amount of time that I have left. This is the reason why I am here asking for your help.</p>
<p>The money that I am seeking will be going towards my airfare, my Canadian visa, and my healthy insurance.  I hope you feel inspired enough with my story to help me, and to dream with me. Any amount you are able to donate would mean a lot to me.</p>
<p>Please do not think that I am just doing this for myself.  My dream is to one day share and teach all that I have learned about dance.  I also want to inspire people the same way my mother inspired me.  I love what I do and I want to show my dance and art all over the world if it is possible.</p>
<p>I hope you can help me raise this amount of money.  Also, I would love it if you could please share this campaign.  It is another way to help me, and I am forever grateful for that. </p>

of Our Fundraising Campaign
The Playtime Players ensemble includes four musicians and four
actors.  Each member brings a wealth of
diverse personal and professional experiences to our troupe.  We believe that

<h3><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Hello people of the world!</span></h3>
</div>
<p>My name is Abigail Vela and I am a first year attending The University of Texas at Austin. I am currently BA in Theatre and Dance with a focus in Acting. I am from La Joya, Texas, which is a small town in the ""valley"" area down south! </p>
<p>Anywho, the reason I am making this campaign/page is to ask for any small donations from anybody in order to part of my study abroad trip to Florence, Italy. However, I would like to share a little bit as to why I want to study Theatre in Italy in the first place:</p>
<p>As a theatre major, my academic goal is to gain as much experience in the theater through various places, not just my education in the Department of Theatre and Dance. I want to gain connections and a different perspective about theatre arts, and by taking the opportunity to study abroad at Florence, Italy, I will have a head start in my academic pursuits.</p>
<p>This program allows me to complete six hours of credit that will benefit my BA in Theatre and Dance. The program’s course Dress, Decor, Culture, and Performance in Central Italy, will offer Commedia dell’Arte master classes where I will learn a style of theatre that originated in 16<sup>th</sup> Century Italy. I am interested in learning how a character and its mask can be inseparable, and how the characteristics of the mask influence the character’s dramatic movements. I have been curious to learn the fine art of puppetry as well, and how a puppeteer can create and bring pieces of wood, string, and wire alive. With the Commedia dell’Arte master classes and puppetry lessons, this program will give me versatility in my acting and theatrical experience.</p>
<p>I have the opportunity to study and live at a different city, rather than my hometown as a first year at The University of Texas at Austin. Besides Texas, the only place I have ever traveled is Mexico, though I have never lived or studied there. Living in Florence, Italy for the summer promises to enrich my global experience and acting repertoire. </p>
<p>Florence will introduce new environments such as Roman amphitheaters. I will also learn a different culture of theatre, and gain insight toward the various theatre and performance opportunities in Italy. With this study abroad program, the journey towards my dreams will commence. I have faith I will live my goals in the near future if given the chance to take full advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<p>All funds will be released after my deadline for my campaign, which will be May 10, 2013. All funds will go directly towards my program needs, such as:</p>
<p>Tuition, program fee, food, and transportation!</p>
<p>My dream goal is to go past $2000. ALTHOUGH I SPECIFIED THAT MY GOAL IS $2000, I do not expect to reach it in such a small amount of time, which is why I ask for any sort of donations. However, if I reach it before my deadline, I will be forever in gratitude. </p>
<p>Please help me gain experience, help me travel abroad for the first time in my life (including air travel), and please help me make my experience worthwhile! As a favor from many of my friends and family, I will be recording my experiences while in Italy through a blog, which I am in the process of creating. I will post it up here when I have it up and ready to go. </p>
<p>Simply donate any amount, big or small, for any amount will be appreciated immensely. If you can't contribute, it's okay! Help me spread the word by sharing my story with your peers, family, etc. Share this page! Any help is welcome! </p>

<h3>Overture</h3>
Arbor Opera Theater announces a fully staged, fully costumed production of The Marriage of Figaro, to be performed with orchestra June 13-16, 2013 at the Lydia Mendelssohn Theater in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</div>

Based on a Beaumarchais play that was banned in Vienna (and seen as foreshadowing the French Revolution), Mozart and Da Ponte took a huge risk in this first collaboration and created what is a cornerstone of the operatic repertoire.  It's a screwball comedy filled with crazy plot twists and mistaken identities that simultaneously speaks to deep human truths and fears.  Sung in Italian with projected English supertitles, two professional casts, chorus and orchestra breathe new life into Mozart's masterpiece.</div>

<h3>Hello from Wax Wings!</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">A little on Wax Wings Productions...</span></h3>
<p>My name is Micah Greene, I am the Artistic Director for Wax Wings Productions, a young theatre company working in Boston, MA. We are a group of actors, directors, designers and playwrights who came together seeking to create theatre that explores the deepest truths within Human Nature, and how they effect our choices. Elia Kazan, acclaimed director and actor wisely said in his Actor's Vow that ""...The best and most human parts of me are those I have inhabited and hidden from the world. I will work on it. I will raise my voice. I will be heard."" It is our mission to create theatre that excites, provokes and stimulates our audiences, while pursuing those ""hidden"" elements within our deepest selves. </p>
<p><strong>Our current project...</strong></p>
<p>We are hard at work at the closing production of our first season, <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em>. I know, big one to attempt, huh? However, we at Wax Wings are thrilled and eager for the challenge. We've found some amazing actors, talented designers and crew and have a wonderful director at the helm. We hope to continue to build our audience, connect with other theatre groups in Boston and, of course, do Mr. William's masterpiece justice. <em><br/></em></p>
<p><strong>What would a contribution go towards in this campaign?</strong></p>
<p>""I've always depended on the kindness of strangers...""</p>
<p>As a relatively new theatre company, we have been very proud to be able to compensate our performers and designers for their work. We aspire to be professionals and to continue to compensate our artists for the hard work they do. The funding from this campaign will be used to pay the director, actors, design and production team, offset productions costs including the rights, space rental, costumes, props, lights, sound and set costs.</p>
<p>Specifically, we need $2,400 for actor and production crew stipends, $800 for the rights. Funding for the arts can be hard to find. It takes a vibrant, cultural community for them to thrive. We feel lucky to be a part of Boston's Theatre scene, and ask any support from you to continue creating more theatre, more art to give back to the city. Besides our gratitude, we have some pretty neato perks to offer! Take a look-see!</p>
<p><strong>Waxy Productions of the Past</strong></p>
<p>We have been so incredibly fortunate to have produced three shows so far; <em>The Last Days of Judas Iscariot</em>, <em>Grandma's House </em>- an original play by a local Boston playwright (and now, company member!) and most recently, <em>The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus</em> with a primarily female cast. We have, other than our ""mainstage"" productions, our monthly Rumpus Nights which have ranged from staged readings of original works from local playwrights to Shakespeare themed scene studies, to readings of movie scripts (we tackled Resevoir Dogs!). With your help, we can grow and continue to provide more opportunities for directors to take on dream projects, playwrights to get their work done, and actors to stretch their wings.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute to our campaign (thanks for reading this far!), there are other ways that you can help! Word of mouth does wonders for new theatre! Share this link! Talk about us on Facebook, or check out and ""Like"" our Facebook page. That way you can get more info about us! Or go ahead and grab a ticket for the play itself. (Those will be up on our website). We open June 27 and run through July 7 in the Factory Theatre (791 Tremont Street, Boston MA). We hope to see you there!</p>
<p>As we continue and build ourselves as a company, we hope to learn from each production. We want to make sure this Indiegogo campaign is suceesful for the production but also in the eyes of our donors.

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Why was DanceWire created?</b></p>
<p>As a city who loves their arts Portland is home to a plethora of professional dance companies, studios, and dancers in styles ranging from ballet, aerial, and hip hop to tango, Bollywood and swing. But ... while Portland's dance scene is thriving and has a diversity of offerings, sometimes it's hard to find what you're looking for. DanceWire was created to serve as a centralized network for the Portland dance community where all information about what's going on is in one convenient location - classes, performances, workshops, auditions and more. In addition to being an information hub, DanceWire will offer resources to help strengthen the community as a whole.

struggling to learn the customs as a young woman in a foreign land, but her
reality is turned upside down when she is hired by CNN to be an interpreter

of change from the voice of an old woman with bound feet to a heroic hunger
striker. </p>
<p>Today in China there is an entire
generation in the dark about the events of June 4, 1989 - it is forbidden to
discuss. With the current uprisings in Venezula &amp; Kiev and harkening to the
Arab Spring,  TIANANMEN ANNIE is as poignant a story today as it was 25
years ago. </p><p>Most people have seen this picture of the unknown ""Tank Man"" standing in front of some tanks in protest:</p>

commonly known as the June Fourth
Incident (六四事件) or more accurate language as '89 Democracy Movement (八九民运) in Chinese, were student-led popular
demonstrations in Beijing which took place in the spring of 1989 and received broad support from city
residents, exposing deep splits within China’s political leadership. Hardline
leaders who ordered the military to enforce martial law in the country’s
capital forcibly suppressed the protests. The crackdown that initiated on June
3–4 became known as the Tiananmen
Square Massacre or the June 4
Massacre as troops with assault rifles and tanks inflicted casualties on

<p></p></div>","Writer/Actor/Producer Ann Starbuck
and Producer Julie Lawrence are raising funds to produce Ann's amazing
play, Tiananmen Annie, directed by Richard Embardo. Ann
has written and stars in this true, one-woman show depicting the hilarious and
heartbreaking tale of her year in China as she searches for her Chinese soul
and gets swept up in the Tiananmen Square Uprising.She's at first a student,
struggling to learn the customs as a young woman in a foreign land, but her
reality is turned upside down when she is hired by CNN to be an interpreter
during the Tiananmen Square Uprising.  Ann tells the story of China on the brink
of change from the voice of an old woman with bound feet to a heroic hunger
striker. 
Today in China there is an entire
generation in the dark about the events of June 4, 1989 - it is forbidden to
discuss. With the current uprisings in Venezula & Kiev and harkening to the
Arab Spring,  TIANANMEN ANNIE is as poignant a story today as it was 25
years ago. Most people have seen this picture of the unknown ""Tank Man"" standing in front of some tanks in protest:
But what most people don't realize is that he wasn't just stopping a few tanks. Below is an amazing picture by Stuart Franklin showing a much wider shot and the full impact of what Tank Man (tiny image on bottom left) was really blocking. Your contribution will help build a
simple set, rent the Hudson Guild theater for 12 performances and bring this
amazing story to life!
Showtimes are: 
Mondays, June 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd, 30th

Los Angeles.The TIANANMEN SQUARE UPRISING:The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989,
commonly known as the June Fourth
Incident (六四事件) or more accurate language as '89 Democracy Movement (八九民运) in Chinese, were student-led popular
demonstrations in Beijing which took place in the spring of 1989 and received broad support from city
residents, exposing deep splits within China’s political leadership. Hardline
leaders who ordered the military to enforce martial law in the country’s
capital forcibly suppressed the protests. The crackdown that initiated on June
3–4 became known as the Tiananmen
Square Massacre or the June 4
Massacre as troops with assault rifles and tanks inflicted casualties on
unarmed civilians trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen
Square in the heart of Beijing, which student demonstrators had occupied for
seven weeks. The scale of military mobilization and the resulting bloodshed
were unprecedented in the history of Beijing, a city with a rich tradition of
popular protests in the 20th century.
The Chinese government condemned the
protests as a “counter-revolutionary riot”, and has prohibited all forms of
discussion or remembrance of the events since. Due to the lack of information
from China, many aspects of the events remain unknown in China even today.

</h3><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dear Family and Friends,</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As many of you know I am currently in the process of
obtaining my PhD in Dance Studies from Temple University. My intended
dissertation topic will center on the intersections between cognitive
disability and dance in both theatrical performance (the politics surrounding
the employment of cognitively disabled dancers and actors in stage productions)
and the performance of everyday life (living and moving as a cognitively
disabled individual in US society). The inspiration behind this research comes
from my dance education and the education I received from my younger brother
Anthonie, a 16 year old on the Autism Spectrum. In the spring of 2014 I began a
project with Anthonie that attempted to answer the questions associated with the latter
half of my dissertation. For the insights and results obtained, please see the
video attached to this campaign!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In order to continue investigating this work and possibly
extend the research to other individuals on the Spectrum, I want to become
certified in Autism Movement Therapy. Though my current academic plate is very
full, this certification is no offered as a part of my PhD or Fellowship.
Therefore, I need to find outside funding to enroll in the certification
workshop. This is where you come in! </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Do you want to help fund my research so that it can reach
many individuals, or would you rather hear me gripe about the pitfalls of
academic funding at every family gathering for the next three years? The choice
is yours! Though my goal is $700 (the full cost of the program), I am launching
this campaign to offset the cost of tuition, so any amount you can contribute
will be appreciated. If you give a little, we all can do quite a lot!! Please
consider contributing. No amount is too small. I look forward to sharing more

In his workshop <i><a href=""http://libbyskala.com/lilia.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lilia!</a></i> was born. Years later at a performance, a patron suggested I write a show about Lilia's sister, the baby nurse who'd nursed her son 50 years earlier.<br/><br/><p>I dismissed the idea, thinking <i><b>Lilia!</b></i> was my one-hit wonder. I had no stories of Lizi. She'd been the nurse in attendance at my home birth, but she was a private person devoted to her practice. How was that stage-worthy?<br/></p>
<p>Instead, I wrote a show about Lilia and Lizi's middle sister Lisl, an award-winning dance therapy pioneer (<i><a href=""http://atimetodance.homestead.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Time to Dance</a></i>). One day, a colleague said, ""You've got two shows about two sisters. But there were three. You need a third show about the third sister."" <br/></p>
<p>I finally agreed to embark on the unknown. When my dad, a former journalist and people-person, heard about the project, he began tracking down mothers who'd used Lizi as their nurse. After a few interviews, I discovered that her life is not only stage-worthy, but has significance in its historical context and in the impact it made on society.<br/></p>
<p>In the meantime, I married musician Steven May and wanted to collaborate with him on a project. In our living room, we improvised together Lizi's story with his mandolin music. Insightful colleagues gave us feedback and direction. Our first incarnation of <i><b>Felicitas</b></i> was well-received at The One-Woman Standing Festival.<br/></p>
<p>Next, we applied to the New York Fringe Festival as a multimedia production and got in! We enlisted the talents of video designer Stephen Stevo Arnoczy and director Janice L.

<p></p><p></p></div>","STRETCH GOALS:1) $8,500: BLING! - ACHIEVED! Reaching $8,500 will pay for sparkly bits that will make our costumes more visible from far away,
and beautifully shiny in the spotlights. Swarovski crystal details aren't cheap, but their visual impact is tremendous and they are a staple
element of traditional circus costumes for this very reason.2) $11,500 SUPERIOR MASTERING! - ACHIEVED!
Professional
mastering for the score so the music sounds as good recorded and
played back over theater speakers as it did live in the studio.
We're writing it, we're recording it, lets make it sound as fantastic
as it deserves. Reaching this goal means all of you backers who have
a download of the album just got an upgrade in your reward.3) $14,000 MORE MUSICIANS!
We
would like to hire a chorus and even more string musicians, to
really give the score for Hinge a full and dramatic sound.
Synthetic instruments are nothing compared to the real thing. Help us employ more professional
artists, and make this album everything it can be.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Circus is coming to town!My name is Bunny Holmes [Zlotnik] and for the past five years I've been putting on shows locally in the Bay Area, and touring each summer to visit places like Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Texas, and Louisiana with my small and very magical circus troupe, The Vespertine Circus.
So far, our production value has been stifled by the fact that we are funding our shows exclusively with ticket-sales. We've cobbled together costumes from thrift-store garments and scavenged for props and set pieces, but we are ready to build a show as beautiful as our dreams are. We aim to improve the spectacle and visual-impact of our shows, without raising the price of admission. 
In this spirit, we've joined forces with our nonprofit sponsor, Fractured Atlas, while we undergo the transformation into a 501c3 non-profit organisation ourselves - so we can bring high quality circus-theater performances to audiences all over the USA who could not typically afford to see these arts in person.
What We NeedThis campaign has two goals:

Creating elaborate, beautiful costumes for our six actors. This will cost $3,000 and is no small feat. They need to both beautiful and strong because they will be worn for hundreds of acrobatic performances. We are working with Gibbous Fashions and Subverse Industries for costume-construction, and no detail will be left un-noticed. These garments will be as whimsical and dreamy up close as they are from 100ft away, and will be sure to leave a strong impression on many an imagination.
 Composing & recording a score for our two-hour long production [Hinge], of unique music designed to create an aural landscape in which the show takes place. Music which follows and supports the emotional arc and story being told by the performers. Jesse Buddington and A. Lowe are working together to write the songs, and once they are composed we will be collaborating with local musicians (Unwoman, Ian M Dawson, and Shaly Borgen, to name a few) to record it. To start this process, we have budgeted a modest $3,000. The album will be available online for digital purchase, and an early-release download of it will be available to backers at a certain level. 

Involving this many artists in our show is a reward unto itself, as it's a chance for our small company to join forces with other creatives and build something magnificent. These elements will be key parts of countless performances, moving forward, and last us for many years.The remaining portion of our goal $ here is for fulfilling backer rewards & processing fees. Of course, $3,000 isn't very much for top quality costumes for an entire cast, nor is it a lot of money to make a soundtrack with - it's the bare minimum in our case, and we hope to continue to raise more money above and beyond our initial goals so we're able to further improve the quality, and involve more artists. Every cent earned on this campaign will go directly into making Hinge more wonderful.
Rewards for Roustabouts (YOU!)

A download of the soundtrack as soon as it's recorded! Take a listen to the album you helped create! Approximately an hour of music that blends Renaissance-style melodies with hip-hop rhythmic structures. Cello, violin, guitar, bass, mandolin, banjo & a choir. Instead of traditional drums, we will use foley for the bulk of of our percussion, mixing the sounds of nature with industrial & urban soundscapes.
We will be screen-printing and distributing backers-only ROUSTABOUT T-shirts (may we call you wonderful people our roustabouts? Truly, those are the laborers who raise the Big Top tent and make the circus possible, and I daresay it's a fitting title for you, who are enabling our show right now.) Below is a design preview - we may change it to incorporate the word ROUSTABOUT if backers prefer, but felt ""tent crew"" was more clear, tell us what you think!

I am 22 and I fell in love with dancing when I was entering a hard phase of my life 10 years ago where I stopped communicating with people around me and fell prey to depression that eventually led me into a long struggle with eating disorder. I have come through stronger than ever. Dancing was the only thing that kept me connected with the world, bringing me on scholarships to Australia, Japan, New Zealand, New York, Singapore.

IN EUROPE! </p><p><b>My story</b></p><p>I found a voice in movement that kept who I am inside alive. Coupled with music, the magic happens, where nothing exists, but the taste of joy. That is dance to me. I am not born an artist nor am I born a dancer, but I am born to be touched by my surroundings, the people around me. I observe their movements, the emotions behind it all. I observed a little girl hopping on the transparent bridge in a shopping mall at Pavillion KL, the different paces and expression of people exercising in the cities of Wellington, Singapore, New York(central park), Kuala Lumpur and my hometown.  It is fascinating to see the rhythm in their bodies. I have a dream of becoming a dancer. And I have an even bigger dream of sharing my passion that has shaped me into someone who is curious(questions), and adventurous(take actions). A person who can now, not only speak mandarin, cantonese, malay, english, but speaks and hear body, too. I was an awkward person without friends. Dance has given me a link bridge to connect with people passionate in many other fields, football, economics, engineering, architecture, psychology, fitness, yoga. To advance in my dancing, I was forced to find what I had been missing, human connection. Any practice means nothing when it is not shared. I want to share my passion.

As performers and artists often times we work for a lower amount or for free because we just love what we're doing, or because we're impassioned about a project or we do it because we could not survive without making art. I believe the artists I work with should get paid what they deserve which is why I play the lottery : ) Seeing that I haven't won the lottery yet, I am hitting the fundraising trail.<br/><br/>Three different shows, 26 performers, 10 crew and a total of 16 performances means a chunk of change. We’ve gotten a grant from the City Council, have had many in-kind donations like my friend David Gilmore who is designing posters and flyers for free, a $,1500 savings, or Chrissy who is costuming us, or the restaurant Southern Cross who are letting us use their space for free saving us over $1,000 in rental; these, plus other in-kind donations all add up but it doesn't cover the cost of salaries.</p>
<p><br/>My goal is that all performers and crew get $100 a performance, if someone does 9 performances my hope is to pay them $900 and the people who created and directed the work need to get paid as well. All these salaries alone add up to over $22,000 and don't include rent, props, costumes, publicity et al. If we sell out every show at the top tier ticket price we will bring in $15,420 yet all budget makers for shows say you can only count on 1/3 of your tickets sales actually coming in which means we will bring in around $5,140. From that we will pay expenses first, like publicity, printing, registrations fees for the Fringe etc. and what's left over will be divided by the artists involved in windyPAE. It's slim pickings but we're doing it anyway because we believe in the work.</p>
<p><br/>The work. These three shows are the inaugural productions of my new company, windyPAE (windy Performing Arts Ensemble). Our shows are funny, clever, tight, original and moving... all the things you want in a performance! Through our murder-mystery bike play, <strong>Wheels of Justice,</strong> we highlight the unbelievably great graffiti and wall art in Wellington. In <strong>TOUCHED</strong> we will be exposing Contact Improvisation with new audiences while combining the rich talents of spoken word artists, musicians, installation artists and digital artists; and <strong>THE PENIS MONOLOGUES</strong>, a solo show that takes place in a bar, addresses issues that are often left silent.</p>
<p><br/>Your contribution not only says to the creators and performers in these shows that their desire to make a livelihood in the performing arts is supported, but it also sends a strong message to artists and future artists that they are wanted, needed, appreciated and valued in society. Imagine how different this world would be if we all felt wanted and valued.<br/><br/>Please watch our video to see your friends and family in it and learn a bit more about who we are and what we're doing. Below is what you can get if you contribute money to help us meet our goal of $8,000, and never fear, if you can't contribute you can help by spreading the word.<br/><br/>Cheers!<br/><br/>Tommy</p></div>","HI ThereWe're looking to raise funds that will help pay salaries for 26 performers in three different shows.

If we sell out every show at the top tier ticket price we will bring in $15,420 yet all budget makers for shows say you can only count on 1/3 of your tickets sales actually coming in which means we will bring in around $5,140. From that we will pay expenses first, like publicity, printing, registrations fees for the Fringe etc. and what's left over will be divided by the artists involved in windyPAE. It's slim pickings but we're doing it anyway because we believe in the work.
The work. These three shows are the inaugural productions of my new company, windyPAE (windy Performing Arts Ensemble). Our shows are funny, clever, tight, original and moving... all the things you want in a performance! Through our murder-mystery bike play, Wheels of Justice, we highlight the unbelievably great graffiti and wall art in Wellington. In TOUCHED we will be exposing Contact Improvisation with new audiences while combining the rich talents of spoken word artists, musicians, installation artists and digital artists; and THE PENIS MONOLOGUES, a solo show that takes place in a bar, addresses issues that are often left silent.
Your contribution not only says to the creators and performers in these shows that their desire to make a livelihood in the performing arts is supported, but it also sends a strong message to artists and future artists that they are wanted, needed, appreciated and valued in society. Imagine how different this world would be if we all felt wanted and valued.Please watch our video to see your friends and family in it and learn a bit more about who we are and what we're doing. Below is what you can get if you contribute money to help us meet our goal of $8,000, and never fear, if you can't contribute you can help by spreading the word.Cheers!Tommy",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who we are and what we do:</h3>
<p>FrenetiCore is a non-profit organization that offers creative community experiences to the public through the presentation and promotion of original theater, dance, film, and music in Houston, Texas.  In addition to maintaining a dance company that presents daring and innovative works, the organization also produces the Houston Fringe Festival, offers weekly dance classes for both children and adults, promotes local artists through an Artist in Residence program and Artist Board, and offers affordable theater rentals.</p>
<p><em>The Sacred Harp, </em>a multimedia dance theater production about the journey of a young interracial couple, was originally performed in 2004 is being reprised in honor of FrenetiCore's 10 year anniversary. On April 19 at Miller Outdoor Theatre, FrenetiCore will present this free, family-friendly performance that tackles issues of morality with a message of tolerance and acceptance.  </p>
<p><em>The Sacred Harp</em> is set in an early 20th century, small Southern town divided by race but united by faith.  At the center of the story is a young couple, deep in love, but with one controversial problem: he is black and she is white.  An uprising begins when the townspeople discover the couple’s relationship and an evil traveling preacher places a spell over the town causing them to commit a terrible injustice against the couple.  The town’s trusted preacher regains hold of his congregation, but not before lives are lost.  In the end, the townspeople find redemption in societal change and finally come together in hope.  </p>
<p><em>The Sacred Harp</em> is told through contemporary ballet, modern and American folk dance, along with historical shape-note music and narrative film while portraying the journey of Southern society from oppression and prejudice to tolerance and acceptance.</p>
<p>Featuring choreography by Rebecca French, film and costumes by Ashley Horn and lighting design by Kris Phelps.</p>
<p>Performers include Shanon Adams, Kira Boerkircher, Adam Castaneda, Dorianne Castillo, Taylor Coon, Makeda Easter, Rebecca French, Jaime Fruge, Carlos Guzman, Erica Henderson, Ashley Horn, Mallory Horn, Lauren Hurstell, Naana Jefferson, LaShanna Leonard, Aileen Mapes, Mollie Miller, Drew Peerless, James Pitre, Varina Rush, Denzel Taylor and Ruben Trevino.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To bring this relevant and powerful story to life requires a large cast and crew. With over twenty performers, plus a lighting designer, choreographer, costume designer, administrative staff and more <em>The Sacred Harp </em>is a large undertaking both in effort and in dollars. We will not receive any ticket revenue to help fund performer fees. All performances at Miller Outdoor Theatre are free to the public, supporting the notion that art is for all! We are so proud to be a part of that mission!</p>

<h3>Why we wrote a musical</h3>
<p>As music industry and musical theatre professionals with over 70 years' experience in the team, we felt a little disillusioned that theatres all over the world are being filled with 'jukebox' musicals. These are musicals loosely based around a collection of pre-existing pop songs, sometimes with only the flimsiest pretext of a story to thread them together.</p>
<p>These shows can be great — Mamma Mia, We Will Rock You, and so on — but surely there should be room for musicals where the music only exists because it is helping in the telling of a great story; in developing characters about whom we care. Characters we laugh with, cry with; people we fear for, who we cheer for as they overcome their struggles in life.</p>
<p>And so we selected a cracking story — Ivanhoe, by Sir Walter Scott — and added an interesting new twist to make it even more appealing to today's audiences.</p>
<p>All the music is specially composed and orchestrated by a team who have been involved in many blockbuster shows and productions over the years.</p>
<h3>A brand new show on a classic theme</h3>
<p>We're getting ready to take it to producers and theatres around the world, and we need some help with the launch phase. We are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mike Sheppard [composer/lyricist], </li>
<li>Phil Edwards [composer/lyricist], and </li>
<li>Will Hammond [playwright]</li>
</ul>
<p>We have worked hard on this show for almost three years and now it's ready to be shown to the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $15,000 to fund a website and the promotional campaign to make producers aware of the show.</li>
<li>Contributors will receive a range of goodies, including signed CDs, signed copies of the script, invitations to the rehearsals and, of course, those all-important opening night tickets.</li>

<p></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is a brand new musical loosely based on an updated version of Sir Walter Scott's classic tale of medieval knights and damsels in distress.</li>
<li>We are industry professionals with solid track records in theatre and tv.</li>

<p><strong><em>Hatch!</em></strong> has been praised for its creative staging, dark tone and unique perspective.

It is the ninth of November and on one ill-fated flight, well-meaning Suzie is taking matters into her own hands. Ten jet stream-crossed passengers have roughly thirty thousand feet to live as Suzie saves the world.
So please, return tables and trays to their upright positions and fasten your seatbelts as Suzie and her fellow commuters take to the skies.
I Will Not Hatch! has been in development since 2004. It was presented at:

York University’s playGround Festival in 2005 
The Berkeley Street Theatre (The Hank Marvin Theatre Company) in 2006 
The Toronto Fringe Festival in 2009

Hatch! has been praised for its creative staging, dark tone and unique perspective. In 2009 it played to full houses at the Toronto Fringe and was named for “Outstanding Ensemble” and “Outstanding Direction” in NOW Magazine’s Fringe Wrap-Up. The 2009 production also received FOUR STARS from EYE Weekly. In 2006 NOW called the piece “A WINNER” that “provided a good share of laughs and a couple of shivers.”

<p>We need to raise $20,000 for this show and we know that with your
help we can DO IT! You can all be a part of creating magic on stage! </p>
<p>The money will go to paying for: $12,000 fora 4 weeks run at Stage IV Theater in the heart of
the Theater District in NYC (Roy Arias Studios and Theaters 300
West 43rd Street NY), $8000 to be divided among rehearsal space for our amazing actors, costumes and make up, the set, crew and advertising! This is a
non-paid gig for all of the actors and the crew but if we can fund all of these

Hello Everyone! I'm Maria Riboli, the director an
co-producer of the fast paced dark comedy ""Panic at the Riverside Motel""
written and co-produced by John Pastore. I am extremely excited about bringing to life one of the funniest theater plays I've ever read!


""Panic at the Riverside Motel"" will keep you on the edge of your seats wanting more...unless of course you'll be rolling on the floor laughing and there's a pretty high chance that you'll be doing that.
I have over 30 years of theater experience in New York, Italy,
England, France and I’m pouring my heart into making this hysterical comedy into a
memorable theater production in the heart of the Theater District in NYC!
We need your help in bringing this funny story to life! We are not backed by any company or theater and we are putting this show up from
scratch!
Any contribution from you will help us to fund this project. $1,
$5, $10 or $50 will be helpful! Anything is appreciated and accepted. Please help
us to bring this show to LIFE! 





What We Need & What You Get






We need to raise $20,000 for this show and we know that with your
help we can DO IT! You can all be a part of creating magic on stage! 
The money will go to paying for: $12,000 fora 4 weeks run at Stage IV Theater in the heart of
the Theater District in NYC (Roy Arias Studios and Theaters 300
West 43rd Street NY), $8000 to be divided among rehearsal space for our amazing actors, costumes and make up, the set, crew and advertising! This is a
non-paid gig for all of the actors and the crew but if we can fund all of these
things, with your help, then I would LOVE to give our cast & crew something
for all of their hard work and passion! 
AND there are some perks for you, the contributor! Check out our
perks section to see how you can get a shout out on our FACEBOOK page, a signed ""Panic at the Riverside Motel"" poster from the cast and crew, your
name on our website, free tickets to the show and more!
If we do not reach our goal the money we raise will still go to
funding for Theater space, rehearsal space and the costumes/set for the show.
But I am confident that we will reach our goal with your help!

<p>There is such a great modeling, acting, fashion, and art community here and sadly many people never get their lucky break. This is an event for local talent and businesses, so that they can network with each other. We put together all the different talent that we can find to bring as many people as possible together, and to give encouragement to the young artists who often feel like their dreams are impossible to achieve. This event gives them the knowledge and experience of working in front of a large crowd, and energizes the young talent to follow their dreams, as well as giving them the social opportunities to do so.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Josh Wilder. I'm a third year acting major at Carnegie Mellon University School of Drama and proud Philadelphia native. PERFECTION all started as a conversation that I had with my co worker about the gentrification of Harlem, his personal story of over coming gang violence and the hardships he faced being an inner city youth in New York, that ultimately led him to college. In February 2010, I recorded a series of our conversations and with his blessing I had to make his story accessible to everyone who was willing to listen. I transcribed all our our sessions and created the one man show and actually performed in the basement of the FRAME GALLERY on Carnegie Mellon's campus. My great friend and mentor, Larry Powell, who just finished working with the Lincoln Center Theatre in NYC came down to sign on as director. His passion and vision for the piece made it a very important piece of theatre that had to go on for another workshop. </p>
<p>In the fall of 2010 I edited the piece again and it got accepted in to Carnegie Mellon's PLAYGROUND Festival of new student work. Larry came back from New York to direct the piece again and brought sound designer, Hidenor J. Nakajo on to the project which took it to new heights, I also brought in some colleagues of mine: Adrian Enscoe who added  new elements to the piece through his mask creations and Julie Mallis who provided bold scenic designs to support the vision. Kendra Chapman served as Stage Manager and Alesia Etinoff as Dramaturg. None of this would be possible with our their outstanding collaboration. </p>
<p>The ultimate goal of this piece is to have the world premiere in Harlem, where the play is based, but we want to try it out in other major cities such as Los Angeles THIS SUMMER and Chicago WINTER 2011. With your help and support we can make this happen and help open the eyes of many people who don't understand the lost lasting effects gentrification has on the inner city, especially the youth. Here's a brief synopsis of the show:</p>

I am currently developing my Transitions Dance Project, which is a reflection of what I have learned for the past four years here at Arizona State University. I have been dancing for about 13 years. I have ben trained in Jazz, ballet, Tap, Lyrical and Modern. My project is about myself and the past 25 years of my life. I am stripping the brick walls and layers that I have built up throughout my life due to bad or personal and negative conflicts which have caused me to hold so much in. Throughout the piece you will see a progression from where I have come from to where it is I am going. I am working with a cast of eight female dancers. This has been very challenging due to the fact that I am a man and the audience will be viewing my life through eight female movers. I feel that this will allow and enable my audience to find connections and/or relate to what is being seen. It took me a while in my process to really tell my dancers some of the things I have held inside but in the end Its been rewarding cause surprisingly I am learning that the problems I thought I had are very much so universal problems and others can and are relating. With your help I will be able to take my work outside of the university setting and apply it to the Phoenix area to be seen. This allows my work as well as the dancers to get more exposure but most importantly we will get to continue to promote the art of dance in the Valley of the sun! Through your kind funds I will also be able to hire a lighting designer as well as begin making costumes to enhance my work and story. The effect that you would have on not only me but my dancers as well will be nothing short of AMAZING! We have been working on this project for about a year now and have all grown very close to one another. With your help I feel like I can really present something that is not only entertaining but also most importantly self-therapeutic. So far I have gained so much confidence as an artist and choreographer. I plan on continuing to create and developed more work that people can really relate to and hopefully inspire others. </p></div>","Hello my name is David Riojas and I am a senior dance major this year at Arizona State University.

<p>Daydreams + Nightmares Aerial Theatre (shortened to DNA Theatre) is an aerial movement theatre company which strives to reinvent circus arts using traditional apparatus, imaginative aerial structures, and unorthodox themes and performance compositions. We hope to introduce diverse audiences to our unique interpretation of theatrical arts. By telling stories with movement, music and non-traditional circus arts, DNA Theatre exposes audiences to a new type of theatre that defies definition and traditional performing boundaries. DNA Theatre's style of company collaboration is guided by Artistic &amp; General Director Kel Millionie and Director Elle Brande.</p>
<p>In nine years DNA Theatre has grown from a single person operation to a variable team of over thirty-five creative individuals. Our collective of performers, designers, technicians, artists, and developers are an eclectic team. While some of our company members are gymnasts, dancers, and acrobats, others are ceramicists, Apple Geniuses, dog-walkers, and musicians.  Our team needs your help to continue our successful presentation of astounding and community-engaging theatre.</p></div>","The Show
DNA Theatre's team of innovative directors and designers are collaborating with some of the region's best actors and aerialists to portray an adaptation of William Shakespeare's classic story of love and betrayal.
Armed with an abridged version of the original text, The Tempest will astound the senses as DNA Theatre's largest production to date. Immersing the audience in a 360-degree experience, performers surround the audience at Baltimore Theatre Project creating a multi-sensory theatrical experience.
Aerialists paired with actors and dancers soar overhead in this 75-minute experience full of DNA Theatre's captivating visual style, and engaging storytelling technique.
The Tempest promises to be an accessible theatre experience not-to-be-missed. Help us bring this new work to the community with a gift today.
