</div><p>When not close to their babies, mothers are always worried about where the baby might have gone and whether they are kept warm.<br/></p>
<p>This is a longstanding
natural concern because small babies are
not yet capable of regulating their body temperature.</p>
<p>Additionally, in modern life, this worry becomes a torment because as
people have fewer babies, they become even that much more precious.</p>
<p>If you are
a mother, you might have already felt as
you came back home and watched your baby
that something was not as it should be. And that feeling is rather awful. Whenever
you suspect that your baby might not have
been kept warm and away from drafts, stay in the doubt is devastating.</p>
<p>With Wabbee, those concerns are gone. It lets you
know exactly what happened, and you will no longer feel the anguish of staying
in doubt.</p>
<p>Wabbee
keeps record of:</p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>Drafts at the place where your child
was. How strong and for how long.</p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>The room temperature everywhere your
child went.</p>
<p>Wabbee attaches to your child’s clothes and records room temperature changes
and drafts.</p>
<p>You
download all measurements from the Wabbee with one App in your cell phone or
tablet.</p>
<p>The user-friendly APP shows to you the occurrences
where your child might actually have been
vulnerable.</p>

<p>Aptinov designs
and manufactures wireless systems to record temperature and humidity since
2011. Those systems are used mostly in pharmacies, drug warehouses, and distribution trucks.</p>
<p>Once,
Francisco and Hugo were commenting on
advertising, they just heard on
the car radio, stating that: “a few things will never change” and showing a
mother asking a grown up son not to forget his little coat. That reminded them that quite a few times they had heard from
customers in the industry expressions like:
“I would like to have something like this system, for my wife and the baby because
she’s always so upset about the possibility that the child might not have been kept warm.”</p>
<p>Then, they  thought “why not!” Although they are not
focused on business to consumer products, nobody could do it better.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>

<p><b>How does the</b><b>Wabbee</b><b> communicate with the application installed on my phone?</b></p>
<p>Communication is done through Bluetooth Low Energy
Protocol. To receive the data stored in the Wabbee,
just click on your Bluetooth activation button, and all the information stored
in the Wabbee automatically downloads to
your smartphone or tablet.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Is Wabbee’s
wireless </b><b>transmission</b><b> harmful to
my baby?</b></p>
<p>The Wabbee communicates through
Bluetooth Low Energy protocol. The output
power is at least 1,000 times weaker than a typical cell phone. In any case,
the transmission mode can be activated
only after removing the Wabbee from baby
clothing. Just press the corresponding button to enable /disable Bluetooth.</p><p><br/></p>

This is a longstanding
natural concern because small babies are
not yet capable of regulating their body temperature.
Additionally, in modern life, this worry becomes a torment because as
people have fewer babies, they become even that much more precious.
If you are
a mother, you might have already felt as
you came back home and watched your baby
that something was not as it should be. And that feeling is rather awful. Whenever
you suspect that your baby might not have
been kept warm and away from drafts, stay in the doubt is devastating.
With Wabbee, those concerns are gone. It lets you
know exactly what happened, and you will no longer feel the anguish of staying
in doubt.
Wabbee
keeps record of:
1.  Drafts at the place where your child
was. How strong and for how long.
2.  The room temperature everywhere your
child went.
Wabbee attaches to your child’s clothes and records room temperature changes
and drafts.
You
download all measurements from the Wabbee with one App in your cell phone or
tablet.
The user-friendly APP shows to you the occurrences
where your child might actually have been
vulnerable.

a defined limit is exceeded. To do that the Module has to be connected to the internet through Wifi. With
this Module you can get an instant alert anywhere
you are.Project history
Aptinov designs
and manufactures wireless systems to record temperature and humidity since
2011. Those systems are used mostly in pharmacies, drug warehouses, and distribution trucks.
Once,
Francisco and Hugo were commenting on
advertising, they just heard on
the car radio, stating that: “a few things will never change” and showing a
mother asking a grown up son not to forget his little coat. That reminded them that quite a few times they had heard from
customers in the industry expressions like:
“I would like to have something like this system, for my wife and the baby because
she’s always so upset about the possibility that the child might not have been kept warm.”
Then, they  thought “why not!” Although they are not
focused on business to consumer products, nobody could do it better.

<h3>Becky's BrainBook</h3>
<p>Hi there, I'm Becky. When I was younger I had a brain haemorrhage that affected my physical and cognitive abilities. Sometimes these problems frustrated and upset me. It has taken me years to work out ways of coping with these difficulties. I decided to train as a Clinical Psychologist so that I could use my knowledge and experience to help others in a similar situation. Along the way I met Sara, who has a passion for technology. Together, we have a vision. This vision is to enable people who have experienced a head injury to access support, in their own time, with their own technology, wherever they are in the world.</p>

<h3>Would you like to help us?</h3>
<p>We would like to raise funds to develop a smartphone app that will provide education, coping strategies and support for those who have experienced a stroke, concussion or brain injury.</p>
<p>It is important to us that this technology is effective at improving people's quality of life. We need to develop and test a prototype with people who have lived experience. The money we raise will enable us to do this.</p>

<p>Research tells us that women looking for short term relationships tend to be attracted to men with 'stubble', or the 'ever hip' ""5 0'clock shadow"", and women looking for more committed relationships (ie; the guy that you'd happily take home for the 'fam' to meet) are attracted to men with heavier stubble or full beards. </p>

<p><strong>Chicks Dig Beards products;</strong></p>
<p>✓ Are free of parabens, and phthalates</p>

There are many unresolved issues to help people when participate in global medical tourism.SOLUTION OFHospitalsbox is a project built according to the mission and desire of our team to help people reduce medical fee and save more lives. In our country Vietnam and many other countries in the world in general, many people have given up treatment (even though they still have the opportunity to continue to live) just because they do not have enough money to participate in treatment in their home country and they do not have enough information to search for a hospital in another country.Not only that, thousands of chronic diseases such as osteoarthritis, insomnia, hepatitis ... have made millions people more and more dependent on drugs and reduced quality of life. Meanwhile, these diseases can still be cured if treat combination with oriental medicine and western medicine.We want to create a platform that connects hospitals across the globe, making it easy for people to find and compare the health care packages they need at a lower cost but still ensure quality and Medical ethics requirements.On Hospitalsbox, people can:
Buy medical tourism full package
Blood donation
Global SOS connect
Travel explore new lands
Insurances support
In Medical tourism we help patients consulted online with destination hospital before deciding on a medical treatment, supporting visa procedures, book hotels and more importantly, we help connect hospitals in their hometown to conveniently take care of patients after they return home. Hospitals cooperation with us is mostly meet JCI (Joint Commission International) standards in global.We also help people participate in the global blood donation project, make it easier for people to find blood donors in the nearest area especially to support rare blood groups (RH-)... We want to help save more lives, give more people the opportunity to live.You can view our web platform here: https://hospitalsbox.com/Currently https://hospitalsbox.com/ has integrated with hospitals in Vietnam and you can view information in 60 languages with google translate. Every one is allowed to register for a free account at Hospitalsbox. In this account, User not only can connect directly to the destination hospital service system when participating in medical tourism, they can also look up and manage: Legal, Insurance.Our platform is completely free for users and hospitals.

<p><strong>The Need</strong></p>
<p>The Covid 19 pandemic has spread almost world over and will touch the lives in some way of almost everyone on our planet.

<p>This is a global problem. You don’t have to search very far to find the horror stories of these personnel going from multiple masks per day, to using the same mask for extended periods during this ongoing pandemic! To combat this pandemic, to fight for our future, to treat the infected, these individuals are putting their lives on the line over their inability to get a sterile mask. This problem is not going to last 2 weeks but is projected to be an ongoing problem for the next 6 months!</p>

<p>You are probably wondering who we are and why we have built SaniBoXX! Our company is DAMZ Inc.. DBA, RUSH Auto Works (RAW).

I am a mechanical engineer with over 40 years experience in product design, development and manufacture. I also have over 30 issued patents and have won awards for technology initiatives.

<p>As an engineer, when we started to see the effects of this pandemic and its affect on the medical industry and our medical personnel, we started to have some rather extreme emotions. It may be easy to say that these people chose their career path and dedication and its their job to deal with this! Yeh!<br/><br/>Well as an engineer… it is also our job to make sure that they have tools, technology and equipment to do that job. We as engineers are part of that supply chain. There is NO question that that supply chain failed. We have let them down!<br/><br/>Those emotions I mentioned, shame, helplessness, grief even anger they start to play on your mind. At that point you can either find somewhere to hide and feel sorry for yourself our get off your ass and try do something… Anything to help.</p>
<p>There were several groups around designing actuators for BVM’s to address the ventilator shortage. GM and FORD were asked then ordered by the POTUS to start building ventilators, with government backing I will add! So here we had the two largest automakers in our nation stepping in to do something! We, on the other hand, are perhaps the smallest automaker in the nation. No one was going to ask or order us to do anything and we certainly weren’t going to get funded to do it! But we knew we had to try… we had to do something… Anything to help!<br/><br/>Beyond the shortage of ventilators to treat patients the largest problem our medical providers are facing is a shortage of PPE. Their FFRs in particular are in great shortage. They are designed to be disposable and they are supposed to discard them after any contact where they may have been contaminated. Typically, these personnel are provided with multiple masks, some six or more per shift. Today many are getting 1 per week, if they are lucky! The costs of FFRs have gone from $0.41 to in some cases hospitals paying over $10 each. This is not a problem that is going to be solved in 2 weeks some are forecasting shortages for over 6 months!</p>

<p><strong>This is our story!</strong></p>
<p>This is why we started to design and produce the SaniBoXX. We want to help. We hope that we can help our medical personnel stay safe so they can save lives! We are trying to do something…Anything to help!<br/><br/>If we had backing like GM and Ford or had the personal wealth, we would build 10s of thousands and get them to anyone that needed them. We don’t, we have to sell them or raise funds to get them built. We are not making a profit we are selling them at or close to our cost!<br/><br/>We are offering our engineering files and supplier list, for free, to any organization that wants to build them too, so that more can be made and get to people who need them!<br/><br/>The SaniBoXX is not a singular solution, it hopefully will be one of many. It is a personal device and a personal choice weather to use it or not. There are other alternatives, Heat treatment being one that certainly may be a strong viable option. The CDC guidance and N95Decon.org have both published documents detailing the effectiveness of these techniques! </p>
<p>We have heard a lot of other suggestions. Some are ridiculous and obviously will NOT work. Please read the CDC and N95Decon.org documents for full information on FFR Decon!</p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>We have tried to eliminate as many risks as we can in this project. There are only 2, small components that we have to manufacture and are easily made with a CNC router. We have our own 5 axis CNC router and have access to many others through third party supply. All other components have been sourced from reputable suppliers that have current stock. Some of these are coming from overseas so there is risk involved of supply delays due to shipping delays that could be caused by interruptions due to the Covid 19 pandemic. We have mitigated manufacturing scaling risks in this development should it receive extreme orders. </p>

This is why we started to design and produce the SaniBoXX. We want to help. We hope that we can help our medical personnel stay safe so they can save lives! We are trying to do something…Anything to help!If we had backing like GM and Ford or had the personal wealth, we would build 10s of thousands and get them to anyone that needed them. We don’t, we have to sell them or raise funds to get them built. We are not making a profit we are selling them at or close to our cost!We are offering our engineering files and supplier list, for free, to any organization that wants to build them too, so that more can be made and get to people who need them!The SaniBoXX is not a singular solution, it hopefully will be one of many. It is a personal device and a personal choice weather to use it or not. There are other alternatives, Heat treatment being one that certainly may be a strong viable option. The CDC guidance and N95Decon.org have both published documents detailing the effectiveness of these techniques! 
We have heard a lot of other suggestions. Some are ridiculous and obviously will NOT work. Please read the CDC and N95Decon.org documents for full information on FFR Decon!

Risks and challenges
We have tried to eliminate as many risks as we can in this project. There are only 2, small components that we have to manufacture and are easily made with a CNC router. We have our own 5 axis CNC router and have access to many others through third party supply. All other components have been sourced from reputable suppliers that have current stock. Some of these are coming from overseas so there is risk involved of supply delays due to shipping delays that could be caused by interruptions due to the Covid 19 pandemic. We have mitigated manufacturing scaling risks in this development should it receive extreme orders.",13.0,1,"1 Campaign

Here is the process:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>First,</strong> we wash the mask in hot water at 60º Celsius for 30 minutes. This step is only used when the mask is visibly dirty or difficult to breathe through as it tends to shorten the life of the mask.</li>

<strong>Next,</strong> we dry it with hot air at 60º for 30 minutes to sanitize it.</li>

<li>
<strong>Finally,</strong> we apply electricity to renew the static charge.</li>
</ul><p>We designed our device to be easily assembled or disassembled. When it is not in use, it can be folded down for easy storage and packaging.

With so much uncertainty, getting as many protective masks as you can is actually a very rational thing to do! But what is good for the individual is not always good for society. While hoarding is understandable, given everyone's fears, it has caused a global shortage of masks that medical professionals and others require.  The WHO and other organizations recommend only wearing masks sparingly, even though the world would be safer if everyone were to wear a proper mask.</p><p>To compound the problem, people with fewer resources are finding it harder to get proper protection.

And when they do, it removes the essential static charge on the surface of the mask. Although our box will work with any disposable mask, it is especially useful for the N95 mask because of the recharging step.</p><p>You have probably heard of the N95 mask. It is one of the most common and effective masks people use to help protect themselves from viruses. It is also very hard to get currently because it is in high demand. It's officially called the <strong>N95 FFR</strong>. The weird numbers and letters are the classification that the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health uses. The <strong>FFR</strong> stands for <strong>F</strong>iltering <strong>F</strong>acepiece <strong>R</strong>espirator, the <strong>N</strong> is '<strong>N</strong>ot oil-resistant' (there is also R and P for oil-Resistant and oil-Proof), the <strong>95</strong> means it filters out at least <strong>95</strong>% of airborne particles. It was developed in the 1970s for industrial use but became a healthcare standard in the 1990s when a team lead by Tennessee professor Peter Tsai invented a novel way to embed static electricity into non-woven fabric. It proved to be world-changing virus-blocking technology that is now a global standard (<a href=""https://utrf.tennessee.edu/ut-researchers-nonwoven-fabrics-protect-the-health-of-more-than-a-billion-people/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here is a link to how this technology came about</a>).</p><p>We researched how these masks work and discovered that the key reason these masks stop working is that the static charge dissipates.

When the early stage of the breakout happened, he left to visit South Africa to wait out what seemed like a flu that only affected Wuhan China. He was planning on traveling for a little while until the disease was under control and he could come back to work in Xi’an. However, his vacation only lasted a few weeks before the pandemic became global and South Africa went on lockdown. He is currently stuck in Cape Town, South Africa until he can get a flight to either China or the United States. He has been a long time friend and colleague of Kalimorv, so when he was asked to become part of the team, he joined without hesitation.</p><p><strong>Kalimov Lok</strong> is a Macanese maker who lives in Shanghai. Since his mother has a background in bioengineering, she had the foresight to get him a stock of medical masks before most people knew it would become a problem. He quickly realized that everyone was going to need masks. He calculated that a global pandemic would mean that we need 3.7 billion masks every single day. Later officials calculated that number to be 3.2 billion. At first, he was intent on sitting at home and waiting out the pandemic, but one day he noticed an online merchant taking advantage of the situation by selling masks of questionable quality at exorbitant prices. As an inventor, he decided that he could do something about it. A lot of makers in his community were starting to learn and share knowledge about how masks work. He discovered that most masks had an Achilles' heel in that they would need a static charge to work properly. Since his passion is electronics, he decided that there had to be a way to solve this issue.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Jason Leong</strong> was trapped with his family in Yichang, Hubei near Wuhan - ground zero of the early stage of the virus. Having heard about Kalimorv's efforts, he realized that he could help. Kalimorv had an electronics lab and Jason had a lot of material knowledge to help select and order supplies. When the Hubei lockdown was over, Jason quickly drove back to his home town of Guangzhou, a thousand kilometers away. There he was able to work in his lab more effectively.</p><p>With the help of a global network of maker communities to help with research, surveys, collecting data, and analysis, we tested different sketches and blueprints. On May 1st, the team participated in the MIT Hackathon Challenge “Africa Takes on COVID-19.”</p><p><strong>Halima Ouatab</strong> joined the team from Morocco during the hackathon. She brought her expertise in global market chains. Because of COVID-19, she had to pause her studies, terminate her internship, and stay away from her family. She watched as the situation worsening and her community suffered. Halima was key in extending our perspective to include Africa. She encouraged us to find a solution that takes into account the underprivileged, reasoning that if we can address the needs of developing countries first, then it would be easier to modify our product for a global market.</p><p>During the hackathon, we successfully finalized not one, but 2 different working prototypes. We were able to create a proof of concept for our methods to show that we could successfully restore masks with our box. We have continued to upgrade or design after the challenge making the prototype safer and easier to use.

We think this is really fun and it is not as hard as you may think. But, as an add on, you can choose to have us solder it for you.As a bonus, Mitch Altman, a well-known teacher of how-to-solder and a leader of the global maker movement, has offered to help guide you through the process of soldering the circuit board with a live webinar! PRMB - This is an ""industrial"" model that can refresh more masks at a time.There are two versions depending on whether you want hot water or not. The advantage of hot water is that hot water offers a little bit of extra sanitization. The advantage of not using hot water is that it still gets sanitized with hot air and UVC light, but there is lower power consumption.We also are offering makers a DIY version of the kit if you want to make your own enclosure.  this model comes with a DIY handbook on how to build an enclosure for it. An advantage of building your own encloser is that it saves a lot of money on shipping costs. ConfigurationsWhy are we offering different configurations?We have four main reasons:
Since we are assembling them ourselves, having this many options has minimal impact on the assembly process.
You can get them faster because we can stage the shipping as parts come in.
If you are a maker, you have the option to build it yourself!
Your choice of model will help us with market research so we know where to put our resources after the crowdfunding.
All reward optionsShippingTier 1 - We estimated it weighs less than 1 KG.Tier 2 - We estimated it weighs less than 2 KG.Tier 3 - Though it weighs only 5 KG, the oversized package increases the shipping cost dramatically. Isolation Glove BoxWe are offering and isolation glove box (pictured below) for $30. All models of the Mask Reborn Box fit inside. This allows you to use the box in isolation so you can make extra sure that you don't contaminate masks after you sanitize it. The bag features an air-sealed hole to put the power cord through and two gloves to access inside the box. It folds up so you can put it away when not in use. We will also send you 12 sealable bags so you can seal the sanitized masks inside.Isolation glove bag(prototype, and we are still upgrading it better)Re-sealable bagsThese are just regular, re-sealable zipper storage bags like the kind Ziploc makes. We will include some that are the right size for a standard mask. We've included some in the kits just to get you started.Our timeline  Our TeamOur international team We are an international team of makers, inventors, and designers brought together to help the world in a time of crisis. We all had different experiences that brought us together.Torrey Nommesen is an American living in Xi’an, China. When the early stage of the breakout happened, he left to visit South Africa to wait out what seemed like a flu that only affected Wuhan China. He was planning on traveling for a little while until the disease was under control and he could come back to work in Xi’an. However, his vacation only lasted a few weeks before the pandemic became global and South Africa went on lockdown. He is currently stuck in Cape Town, South Africa until he can get a flight to either China or the United States. He has been a long time friend and colleague of Kalimorv, so when he was asked to become part of the team, he joined without hesitation.Kalimov Lok is a Macanese maker who lives in Shanghai. Since his mother has a background in bioengineering, she had the foresight to get him a stock of medical masks before most people knew it would become a problem. He quickly realized that everyone was going to need masks. He calculated that a global pandemic would mean that we need 3.7 billion masks every single day. Later officials calculated that number to be 3.2 billion. At first, he was intent on sitting at home and waiting out the pandemic, but one day he noticed an online merchant taking advantage of the situation by selling masks of questionable quality at exorbitant prices. As an inventor, he decided that he could do something about it. A lot of makers in his community were starting to learn and share knowledge about how masks work. He discovered that most masks had an Achilles' heel in that they would need a static charge to work properly. Since his passion is electronics, he decided that there had to be a way to solve this issue.Meanwhile, Jason Leong was trapped with his family in Yichang, Hubei near Wuhan - ground zero of the early stage of the virus. Having heard about Kalimorv's efforts, he realized that he could help. Kalimorv had an electronics lab and Jason had a lot of material knowledge to help select and order supplies. When the Hubei lockdown was over, Jason quickly drove back to his home town of Guangzhou, a thousand kilometers away. There he was able to work in his lab more effectively.With the help of a global network of maker communities to help with research, surveys, collecting data, and analysis, we tested different sketches and blueprints. On May 1st, the team participated in the MIT Hackathon Challenge “Africa Takes on COVID-19.”Halima Ouatab joined the team from Morocco during the hackathon. She brought her expertise in global market chains. Because of COVID-19, she had to pause her studies, terminate her internship, and stay away from her family. She watched as the situation worsening and her community suffered. Halima was key in extending our perspective to include Africa. She encouraged us to find a solution that takes into account the underprivileged, reasoning that if we can address the needs of developing countries first, then it would be easier to modify our product for a global market.During the hackathon, we successfully finalized not one, but 2 different working prototypes. We were able to create a proof of concept for our methods to show that we could successfully restore masks with our box. We have continued to upgrade or design after the challenge making the prototype safer and easier to use. We are now ready for our next challenge: to show the Mask Reborn Box to the world.",13.0,5,"1 Campaign

<div>You're awesome.  Seriously, if you're consistently working out three hours a week, you're already ahead of the curve. We want to help you stay there. Our 3hr+ formulation contains the essentials to support your active lifestyle, including key vitamins and minerals, energizing B vitamins, and sport-specific dosages of calcium, magnesium, and zinc, which are all lost through sweat. Our 3hr+ formulation includes 3,000IU of Vitamin D, which helps aid energy and hormone regulation. We've also included amino acids L-Carnatine and N-Acetyl Cystene, both proven energy boosters, and Garlic Extract to help regulate cholesterol. It's the athletic baseline you need, in the quantities to support your efforts, and all backed by real science. <br/>

<div>When you work out 6 hours or more each week, people look at you differently. They might not know why, but they see it in your eyes. Determination, focus, drive. You're serious, they know it. Our 6hr+ supplements were built for you—we boosted the levels of key ingredients in our 3hr+ formula, and added a few new ingredients that you'll appreciate. First, we added Beta Alanine, an amino acid that reduces acid build up in muscles, reducing pain during hard efforts. We've also included a pre-methylated version of Folic acid to ensure that folate levels are optimal, regardless of your genetic methylation status. Third, we included Vitamin B6 to aid in cell repair and red blood cell production. For you, this all got serious a long time ago. We're here to keep it that way.<br/>

<div>If you're working out 9 hours or more each week, you're in a very elite class of athletes. There's no questioning your dedication, or your effort. We know how much you value those thinner and thinner slices of advantage: the better you get, the harder it gets to improve. You used to talk about shaving minutes, now it's fractions of a second. We've elevated the levels from our 6hr+ formulation and added 2 additional supplements: Nicotinamide Ribosode and Pycnogenol. Both are supported by research to improve athletic performance and endurance, and both are legal for competition. These premium additions make our 9hr+ formulation an exceptionally potent companion to your weekly workout regimen. With 9hr+ you're getting the science-proven essentials in the quantities that match you and your workouts, from a single, certified source.<br/>

<p>Sleep is when your body refuels, produces growth hormones, and resets cortisol levels. Regardless of how or how much you work out, quality sleep will always be a benefit, and without it, you're always at a disadvantage. </p>
<p>The Vitalete +Night formula includes 4 specific ingredients that aid sleep and recovery without resorting to sedatives.  Vitalete +Night includes 5-HTP, which promotes serotonin production—our brain's source of calm, order, and hope. Phosphatidylserine lowers stress and helps aid muscle recovery, and Tart Cherry Extract acts as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant. We've also included Taurine, which has a calming effect on the brain; it's often included in energy drinks to counteract their high amounts of sugar and caffeine.</p>

<p>If you did, then you’ll understand just how awesome inflatable building blocks would be. This campaign is raising money to bring YOU… L-Air Blocks! L-Air Blocks are inflatable building blocks that attach to one another using hook &amp; loop patches. This allows you to build up with confidence and get creative with whatever you're building.

Im a co-founder of L-Air Blocks Ltd &amp; the creator of L-Air Blocks. My goal throughout my life has been to have my own business. I’m half way there by having a company set up but, now I need you. Having gone through a few stages of prototypes, I have now developed the production ready version. This however is where I’ve hit a brick wall. For me to bring the price down, I have to order in bulk (100,000 blocks to be exact) and I need your help to raise £250,000 to pay for the first full production order.</span></p>
<p>We plan to sell the blocks in packs of 5 (Booster), 20 (Starter) &amp; 30 (Bumper). So this first production order will allow us to buy 2,000 packs of 5; 3,000 packs of 20 and 1,000 packs of 30. Depending on what perk you go for, you could get one pack, all three or a multiple of one pack size.</p><h3>Whether you've got kids or you're a big kid at heart!</h3><div>As the idea has grown, we've learnt that the product might be for more than just kids. The target audience we feel is for 4-11 year olds, however we also think that there is a secondary target audience of people 16 years and older. Younger children have a natural curiosity and desire to build, be creative, discover and play. And then with people 16 years and older, it brings back old memories of making a den or a fort when they were younger.</div><div>To start off with the blocks will be available in Red, Yellow, Blue, Green &amp; Orange.

<p>But sometimes, right when you need it most, you don't have a water bottle around.  The thirst is intense!  Why don't you have a water bottle with you?  Because it's just too bulky and inconvenient to carry around everywhere.</p>
<p><b>More Portable</b><br/></p>
<p>What we all really need is a more convenient water bottle.  That way, we don't have to stop at the gas station and buy a soda.  We can save money, save our parched throats, and improve our health and well-being.<br/></p>
<p>Voila: The Squish <i>is</i> that more convenient bottle!  It comes with a cool carabiner lid, so you can just clip it right on your jeans' belt loop and comfortably carry it everywhere.  Also, eliminating a major source of water-bottle-frustration, it will actually fit in your car's cup holder!  <br/></p>
<p>With the Squish, whether you're driving, working, playing... wherever you may be, you never need to be thirsty.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That's exactly what the Squish does!  Pop it out to full size to fill
 it up, then when it's empty shrink it down to a squat little cylinder. 
 It's as simple as that!  Replace your cacophony of random, old, smelly,
 gross water bottles with a lovely, modern,z compact set of Squishes.</p>

<p>Do you have a whole cupboard full of water bottles?  If so, you're not alone.  Many of us do.  When you're not using your water bottles -- and in all honesty you're probably usually not, because, as we covered above, they're just too bulky and inconvenient -- they sure do take up a lot of storage space.  In today's world of urban living and efficiency, can you really afford all that clutter in your life?  Instead of the clutter, wouldn't it be better to have simple, clean, elegant,.... and <i>small</i>?<br/></p>
<p>But wait, how could a water bottle be small, and yet be big enough to hold all the water you need?</p>
<p>What if it could shrink?</p>

<p>Speaking of smelly and gross, that is another problem that the Squish solves.  It's made of high-quality platinum-cured (that's the best) silicone.  That means it's:</p>
<p>BPA Free</p>
<p>Lead Free</p>
<p>FDA Approved<br/></p>
<p>Non-reactive</p>
<p>Non-absorbent<br/></p>
<p>Dishwasher-friendly<br/></p>
<p>In short: it's safe.  Your previous generation of water bottles, made of polycarbonate, polyethylene, other plastics, or even aluminum (which will also have a plastic resin coating by the way)..... ehhh, we're not so sure.<br/></p>
<p>Also: it's really clean.  And easy to keep that way!  Silicone doesn't want to soak anything up.  And virtually nothing will stick to it.  So go ahead and use it for your coffee, your tea, or yes, even that most notorious of smell-producers: your protein shake.  Then just throw it in the dishwasher and it will wash right off.  No lingering flavors or stains left behind.  Or of course washing it by hand will accomplish the same thing.</p>
<p>Because of all this, it can keep looking just as great as the day it was made for years and years to come.  Did we mention it looks great?  It does.  Its stylish profile is really ergonomic, too.  It just feels great!  It's a pleasure to use.  In our testing it's been very durable.  The Squish will be built to last.  The Squish is the water bottle of the future, because it's the only one that will be around for it!</p>

All of these reminders are set up by the caregiver, in a simple and practical way from the mobile application OneCare Dori.Example: Daniel has set up the following reminder to his mother land-line: “Hello mother. Don't forget to take your pill at breakfast. If you had already took it press 1, if you will take it press 2, if you are out of pills press 3, if you need help press 4.” - sent everyday working day at 10h00.Through the mobile application, the caregiver can monitor in real time the status of each reminder, as well as the answers given by the elder.The OneCare Dori Base can also be complemented with xSmart sensors.These sensors allow you to use daily routines – which are increasingly evident with the aging process – to activate the reminders in an automatic and smart way:The caregiver can thus set a reminder that will act according to the accomplishment or not of a certain activity or set of daily activities.Examples:Mrs. Alice has 74 years old, and every morning she must take medication for breakfast. John, Mrs. Alice's son and caregiver, connected eSmart to the toaster that his mother always uses to prepare breakfast, setting up a reminder that automatically operates if the mother didn't prepare it;




Mrs. Alice suffers from heart problems. So, Mario (Mrs. Alice's grandson and caregiver) defined that, whenever his grandmother is with the TV on for more than 6 hours in a row, it is automatically activated a reminder to suggest that Mrs. Alice takes a walk in the surrounding of her house, as instructed by the doctor;






Mrs. Alice must take a special medication once a week. Joan (Mrs. Alice's sister and caregiver), can set it to be sent, automatically, a reminder to her the sister to take the medication, whenever the pill box, that Mrs. Alice keeps in a drawer, it isn't handled the day it is suppose to take that special medication;






Validation: this idea comes from an actual real-life problem. But will our solution be useful for other similar cases? Through the early sale, at an exclusive price of some units OneCare Dori, we will be able to understand what is the true potential and value of this solution.


Development: we have invested great effort and resources developing Onecare Dori. We are currently working on the mobile application and eSmart sensor (electric sensor). Then we intend to develop the mSmart (sensor for drug box) and for this purpose we need your support: the OneCare Dori mSmart early sale, we will get the ""breath"" necessary in order to in a few months develop the hardware and software required so that this sensor becomes real.




Tests and feedback: with all the early sales we can get through this campaign, we aim to create a unique community of beta testers. We want to hear the opinion of the first users of OneCare Dori and fine-tune existing features. We expect to add exciting new features based on feedback we get from this community.



OneCare Dori Base is a monthly subscription service that may be combined with sensors  xSmart, which are acquired through a single payment.
OneCare Dori Base: mobile application + Reminder Service through voice calls; 
xSmart Hub: device responsible for the communication between xSmart sensors and OneCare Dori Base;

Português

É um
sistema de lembretes e notificações em tempo real, criado a pensar nos idosos e
nos seus cuidadores/familiares.
O serviço base - OneCare Dori Base -, permite agendar
lembretes em formato de chamada de voz interactiva para o telefone fixo ou móvel
do idoso. Todos estes lembretes são configurados pelo cuidador, de forma
simples e prática a partir da aplicação móvel do OneCare Dori.




Exemplo: o Daniel definiu o seguinte lembrete para o telefone-fixo da Mãe: “Olá Mãe. Não te esqueças de tomar o comprimido ao pequeno-almoço. Se já tomaste tecla 1, se vais tomar tecla 2, se já não tens comprimidos tecla 3, se precisas de ajuda tecla 4.” – despoletado todos os dias úteis às 10h00


Através
da aplicação móvel, o cuidador pode acompanhar em tempo real o estado de cada
lembrete, bem como as respostas dadas pelo idoso.









Estes
sensores permitem usar as rotinas diárias - que são cada vez mais evidentes com
o avançar da idade - para activar os lembretes de forma automática e
inteligente:




O
cuidador consegue assim configurar um lembrete que actuará consoante a
realização, ou não, de determinada actividade ou conjunto de actividades diárias.

Exemplos:
A Dna. Alice tem 74 anos, e todos os dias de manhã tem de tomar medicação ao pequeno-almoço. O João (filho e cuidador da Dna. Alice) ligou o eSmart à torradeira que a Mãe utiliza sempre que prepara o pequeno-almoço, configurando um lembrete que atua automaticamente caso a Mãe não o prepare;






A Dna. Alice sofre de problemas do coração. Assim, o Mário (neto e cuidador da Dna. Alice) definiu que sempre que a sua Avó estiver com a televisão ligada por um período superior a 6h seguidas, é ativado automaticamente um lembrete a sugerir que a Dna. Alice faça uma caminhada nas imediações de sua casa, conforme indicado pelo médico;





A Dna. Alice tem de tomar uma medicação especial uma vez por semana. A Joana (irmã e cuidadora da Dna. Alice), pode definir que seja enviado automaticamente um lembrete para a irmã tomar a medicação sempre que a caixa dos medicamentos, que a Dna. Alice guarda numa gaveta, não for manuseada no dia da toma da medicação.










Validação: esta ideia surge de um problema real da vida
real. Mas será que a nossa solução serve para outros casos semelhantes? Através
da venda antecipada a preço exclusivo de algumas unidades do OneCare Dori, vamos
conseguir perceber qual o verdadeiro potencial e valor desta solução.



Desenvolvimento: temos investido muito esforço e recursos no
desenvolvimento do Onecare Dori. Estamos neste momento a trabalhar na aplicação
móvel e no sensor eSmart (sensor eléctrico). Seguidamente pretendemos desenvolver o mSmart (sensor para a caixa de medicamentos) e para tal
precisamos do teu apoio: com a venda-antecipada do OneCare Dori mSmart,
conseguiremos o ""fôlego"" necessário para em poucos meses desenvolver
o hardware e software necessários para que este sensor se torne real.


Testes e feedback: com todas as pré-vendas que conseguirmos através
desta campanha, pretendemos criar uma comunidade exclusiva de beta-testers.
Queremos ouvir a opinião dos primeiros utilizadores do OneCare Dori e afinar as
funcionalidades existentes. Contamos poder adicionar novas funcionalidades
interessantes com base no feedback que obtivermos desta comunidade.

P: Qual a distância de comunicação máxima entre os sensores e o concentrador xSmart?R: Os sensores poderão estar a uma distância do concentrador igual ou inferior a 30 metros (quando dentro de um edifício) e até 100 metros (em linha de vista). Cada sensor tem ainda a função ""bridge"" o que significa que tem a capacidade de servir de ""ponte"" entre um sensor que esteja a uma distância superior do concentrador.",47.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>The challenge for us is to place The Bow in front of audiences considering real value fitness equipment &amp; training support. There is a big risk of being overlooked simply because there are so many gimmick fitness products on the market today that is very difficult for consumers to differentiate between a truly brilliant invention and a waste to time gimmick.</p>
<p>As we all know the best product is not always the most successful and that is a real risk on hand for us.</p>
<p>We are very confident that users will agree that The Bow is the best mobile fitness product on the market for a variety of reasons:</p>
<p>1) It is seven (7) time more versatile that other suspension trainer systems</p>
<p>2) It is designed to be virtually unbreakable and perform endlessly, tested commercially for 2 years prior to release.</p>
<p>3) The only fitness system in the world capable of over 400 real exercises in a variety of disciplines.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As an Emergency Room nurse, I see people just like you with chronic conditions such as heart failure, kidney failure, high blood pressure, COPD, and more every day.  Many times these people are in and out of the hospital on a regular basis for worsening conditions and have a very low quality of life. I cannot tell you how common it is to not correctly understand your medications or the diagnosis itself.  It’s not the fault of your physicians or the hospitals that you’ve visited. It’s simply a shortcoming in the healthcare system.</p>
<p>An additional complication you may be facing is how long it takes to get an office visit with your primary care provider.  According to an article in Forbes Magazine, physician wait times have increased 30% nationwide. A March 2017 article in the Houston Chronicle stated that the average wait time for primary care providers is 19 days and only getting longer.  This in large part, is due to the numbers of people moving to the area and the enormous growth we are experiencing. What this means for you is longer wait times, decreased access to your doctor, and inevitably, more frequent Emergency Room visits as a result.</p>
<p>The American Heart Association presented a chart showing the causes of hospitalization for people with heart failure, and declared that over 2/3 of these hospitalizations were preventable.  What this means is, with the proper attention at home, over 3 million Americans could have avoided hospitalization. This is where we can help.</p>
<p>You deserve a  better quality of life than what you’ve been dealing with, and we can make this happen.  When you join Transitional Cardiac Care, we will provide you with the necessary supplies including a scale, blood pressure cuff, and oxygen sensor much like you would have at your doctors office or hospital.  But, unlike your current home medical supplies, our equipment will send your daily vital signs through the internet to our health record where we are watching for any signs of complications or worsening disease processes.  Together, we can detect early signs and intervene immediately. Your physician will be contacted and updated with your progress or any new changes in your condition and be able to make adjustments to your treatment plan at that time.  Most times treatment is very simple when identified early on, and in progressing cases we can get you into your doctor’s office faster and with greater efficiency. I want to be a resource to you and your physician, so we can keep you out of the hospital and enjoying your life the way you want too.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently we are working with third party vendors to supply equipment and technology.  And while these services are performing well, we have a larger mission that they are unable to meet.  You see, we envision a much larger application with trending, positive and motivational feedback based on your unique personality type.  We have developed a system that can be monitored in real time anywhere in the world and increase compliance and understanding of the disease process, signs and symptoms, medications, and so much more.  </p>
<p>To do this however, we need to raise money for both equipment and software.  The initial goal is $30,000 but this is just the starting point to reaching our total goal of $100,000.  With this goal we will be able to provide a free app, bluetooth home equipment, and work in conjunction with major home health companies as well as private individuals to improve patient outcomes.  In addition, members of heart failure support groups like Mended Hearts will be able to get extra discounts.</p>
<p>If we do not reach the full goal, then funds will go to the new app and we will continue to work with third party equipment suppliers.  Obviously this is not ideal, and it does limit some of the capabilities of the system, but it time we will achieve this mission.</p> <p><strong>Perks for you:</strong></p> <p><u>$10 Donation</u></p>
<p>Hand written note of appreciation from our CEO</p>
<p>Eternal gratitude (and who can put a price on that?</p> <p><u>$50 Donation</u></p>
<p>Access to our patient focused educational videos</p>
<p>Hand written note of appreciation from our CEO</p> <p><u>$100 Donation</u></p>
<p>15% off home health equipment</p>
<p>Access to our patient focused educational videos</p>
<p>Hand written note of appreciation from our CEO</p> <p><u>$200 Donation</u></p>
<p>25% off home health equipment</p>
<p>Access to our patient focused educational videos</p>
<p>Hand written note of appreciation from our CEO</p>
<p>And if we meet our $100,000 goal we will donate equipment and app to a member of Mended Hearts in your name!</p>
<p><u>$400 Donation</u></p>
<p>Free home health equipment</p>
<p>Access to our patient focused educational videos</p>
<p>Hand written note of appreciation from our CEO</p>
<p>And if we meet our $100,000 goal we will donate equipment and app to a member of Mended Hearts in your name!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge in accomplishing this is the app development.  There are several apps on the market that can track and monitor vital signs.  But none of them are able to communicate with an electronic health record that your doctor is able to see and review.  None of these apps are designed with the heart failure patient in mind either.  These are all broad based and designed for the general public.  And thats fine for the general public, but I know that you have specific needs that are not being addressed.  Maybe you don't even know what they are yet, but trust me, they are there.  App development is not cheap, fast, or easy and I'm a ER nurse not a app developer.  However, I have teamed with excellent people who are fully dedicated to this project and have their own personal reasons to complete this mission.  1 in 5 people will be diagnosed with some form of heart disease, and we all are affected or know someone who has been affected by heart disease.  Help us reach our goals, so we can help others live their best life.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
As an Emergency Room nurse, I see people just like you with chronic conditions such as heart failure, kidney failure, high blood pressure, COPD, and more every day.  Many times these people are in and out of the hospital on a regular basis for worsening conditions and have a very low quality of life. I cannot tell you how common it is to not correctly understand your medications or the diagnosis itself.  It’s not the fault of your physicians or the hospitals that you’ve visited. It’s simply a shortcoming in the healthcare system.
An additional complication you may be facing is how long it takes to get an office visit with your primary care provider.  According to an article in Forbes Magazine, physician wait times have increased 30% nationwide. A March 2017 article in the Houston Chronicle stated that the average wait time for primary care providers is 19 days and only getting longer.  This in large part, is due to the numbers of people moving to the area and the enormous growth we are experiencing. What this means for you is longer wait times, decreased access to your doctor, and inevitably, more frequent Emergency Room visits as a result.
The American Heart Association presented a chart showing the causes of hospitalization for people with heart failure, and declared that over 2/3 of these hospitalizations were preventable.  What this means is, with the proper attention at home, over 3 million Americans could have avoided hospitalization. This is where we can help.
You deserve a  better quality of life than what you’ve been dealing with, and we can make this happen.  When you join Transitional Cardiac Care, we will provide you with the necessary supplies including a scale, blood pressure cuff, and oxygen sensor much like you would have at your doctors office or hospital.  But, unlike your current home medical supplies, our equipment will send your daily vital signs through the internet to our health record where we are watching for any signs of complications or worsening disease processes.  Together, we can detect early signs and intervene immediately. Your physician will be contacted and updated with your progress or any new changes in your condition and be able to make adjustments to your treatment plan at that time.  Most times treatment is very simple when identified early on, and in progressing cases we can get you into your doctor’s office faster and with greater efficiency. I want to be a resource to you and your physician, so we can keep you out of the hospital and enjoying your life the way you want too.  

What We Need & What You Get
Currently we are working with third party vendors to supply equipment and technology.  And while these services are performing well, we have a larger mission that they are unable to meet.  You see, we envision a much larger application with trending, positive and motivational feedback based on your unique personality type.  We have developed a system that can be monitored in real time anywhere in the world and increase compliance and understanding of the disease process, signs and symptoms, medications, and so much more.  
To do this however, we need to raise money for both equipment and software.  The initial goal is $30,000 but this is just the starting point to reaching our total goal of $100,000.  With this goal we will be able to provide a free app, bluetooth home equipment, and work in conjunction with major home health companies as well as private individuals to improve patient outcomes.  In addition, members of heart failure support groups like Mended Hearts will be able to get extra discounts.
If we do not reach the full goal, then funds will go to the new app and we will continue to work with third party equipment suppliers.  Obviously this is not ideal, and it does limit some of the capabilities of the system, but it time we will achieve this mission. Perks for you: $10 Donation

And if we meet our $100,000 goal we will donate equipment and app to a member of Mended Hearts in your name!
 

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge in accomplishing this is the app development.  There are several apps on the market that can track and monitor vital signs.  But none of them are able to communicate with an electronic health record that your doctor is able to see and review.  None of these apps are designed with the heart failure patient in mind either.  These are all broad based and designed for the general public.  And thats fine for the general public, but I know that you have specific needs that are not being addressed.  Maybe you don't even know what they are yet, but trust me, they are there.  App development is not cheap, fast, or easy and I'm a ER nurse not a app developer.  However, I have teamed with excellent people who are fully dedicated to this project and have their own personal reasons to complete this mission.  1 in 5 people will be diagnosed with some form of heart disease, and we all are affected or know someone who has been affected by heart disease.  Help us reach our goals, so we can help others live their best life.

<h3>Bad breath dilemma</h3>
<p>Lots of people out there struggle with bad breath to some degree. It may ruin your social life. It may limit your career or affect your love life. Visits to dentists, expensive mouthwashes, endless gum chewing, brushing and flossing five times a day may only mask the problem. Chlorine or alcohol-based mouthwashes can make your mouth dry and the problem worse. Brushing - there is only so much you can brush during a busy work day and chewing gum may cause all kinds of adverse health effects. All these solutions focus on the mouth when in some cases, bad breath may originate in the throat (tonsil stones), the esophagus and the stomach (keto breath).</p>
<h3>Proposed solution</h3>
<p>You may find yourself at your wit's end and start experimenting with various home remedies. I started looking for an organic, additive-free solution for my occasional bouts of bad breath a few years ago. After much research and trial-and-error experiences of my own, I stumbled into parsley. For thousands of years, parsley has been known and used for its anti-fungal, antibacterial and anti-mutagenic properties. Mainly, it can suppress digestive tract bad bacteria growth for extended periods of time. It tastes great. It is natural and healthy and best of all, you can grow it in your own garden.</p>
<p>Parsley seed oil has been used and marketed before in various oral hygiene products, but with varying success. It may not have the same properties as organic parsley. I found parsley to work better, but the only problem was that the parsley extract is perishable.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing process</h3>
<p>I developed a proprietary blend of various parsley extracts and essential oil combinations. For the base, I used organic grapeseed oil. It is tasteless, odourless and fairly light. Fresh, organic parsley is washed and dried. Then it is milled to a fine consistency and mixed with the base oil. Afterwards, I let it sit for awhile to allow the oil to absorb the parsley extract and for water and particles to settle. The infused oil is then harvested using gravitational pull and further refined using advanced filtering techniques.</p>
<p>The next challenge was how to boost parsley power with a fresh scent. After some experimenting, I tried adding organic mint extract which resulted in a promising product. It has a long shelf life as it is oil based. Mint and parsley act as natural preservatives preventing oil from getting rancid. It is an amber-green, clear liquid. It has a pleasant smell and taste. It also has moisturising properties and helps soothe dry mouth.</p>
<h3>Parsleyfier - soothes bad breath</h3>
<p>To this day, I use the product myself and came up with the name Parsleyfier. It is an absolute miracle and a life saver. I take about half a teaspoon three times daily, and the results are remarkable. It can be taken either on an empty stomach or after a meal. My breath is usually at its worst after 2 PM, and this is usually the time when most meetings take place at work. Parsleyfier solved the problem and gave me confidence. <strong>No more bad breath.</strong></p>
<p>The product is light. It tastes refreshing. It is easy to take, and it works for 2-3 hours. </p>
<h3>How you can help bring the product to the market</h3>
<p>I would very much like to share this product with others struggling with the problem of bad breath. However, it needs more work in order to reach the market. I have a domain name reserved - <a href=""http://www.parsleyfier.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.parsleyfier.com</a> . I also designed bottling and labelling for the product. I can produce small test batches (50-100 bottles).</p>
<p>To take it to the next level, in addition to my own investment, I require further funding in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refine the recipe and the manufacturing process</li>
<li>Purchase equipment for medium-sized batch production</li>
<li>Purchase bottling, labels and packaging</li>
<li>Fund an online marketing campaign</li>
<li>Research liability and insurance requirements</li>
</ul>

Después de haber vendido las mejore marcas de productos de entomofagia en Europa, decidimos hacer uestra propia marca. Para lograr esto, unimos a los mejores socios posibles de toda Europa, todos alineados con nuestra filosofía, para crear un producto revolucionario. Para nosotros era esencial encontrar un grupo de empresas que apoyara nuestro proyecto y nuestra filosofía detrás de él. Juntos, a través de nuestros esfuerzos de colaboración hemos avanzado poco a poco para crear el mejor polvo de proteína de insecto del futuro.

Para nosotros era esencial encontrar un grupo de empresas que apoyara nuestro proyecto y nuestra filosofía detrás de él. Juntos, a través de nuestros esfuerzos de colaboración hemos avanzado poco a poco para crear el mejor polvo de proteína de insecto del futuro. Ahora, gracias a la comunidad de Indiegogo, estaremos listos para producir el primer Becrit Insect-Protein y dar los primeros pasos para cambiar el mundo.
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 


 


 
 

 
 

Al comienzo de Becrit, nos sentamos para hablar del futuro en un chiringuito de la playa mientras bebiamos unos “zumos”. En ese momento escribimos algo que dictaría el camino de nuestras futuras decisiones.
 

 
 

 

 
El Basque Culinary Center es la mejor universidad culinaria de España y un centro de investigación e innovación en el mundo de la alimentación y la gastronomía.
Eligieron a Becrit entre las start-ups gastronómicas con más potencial del país. Nos enseñaron los entresijos del negocio de la alimentación, desde restaurantes hasta online retailers.
Aprovechamos este momento para mostrar nuestra gratitud al BCC por todo lo que aprendimos, por toda la ayuda que nos ofrecieron y, por su puesto, por los buenos amigos que hicimos en el camino.",42.0,0,"2 Campaigns

adopter. Beta testers will take part of the building of Growiti and his name
will be shown on our website. Plus, they will get one unit of Growiti for free on ocassion of the launching if the make a order.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Is this the release candidate?</b></p>The version of Growiti you'll get is a working prototype. The release candidate will be developed after collected and evaluated
all your opinions.

<p></p>
<p><b>I’m already a beta tester, what am I supposed to do?</b></p>
<p>Enjoy the experience and experiment
whilst you take care of your potted plants. At the end of the probationary
period you will voluntary and anonymously fill in an online survey. That’s all.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What can I grow with Growiti?</b></p>
<p>You can grow any houseplant, both
indoor and outdoor. But please, consider that Growiti only works on potted
plants.</p>
<p><b>How many plants can I track with my mobile device?</b></p>
<p>You can install and track so many plants
as you have. Growiti app is not limited to a fix number of sensor.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>How big is the soil moisture sensor?</b></p>
<p>We are building Growiti in a 50x50mm
size.</p>
<p><b>Where should I bury the soil moisture sensor?</b></p>
<p>To have a better performance and
avoid noise and signal break down, consider burying your sensor next to the pot
border.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><b>Can I use Growiti in a garden or outdoor?</b></p>
<p>You can use Growiti exclusively in potted
plants, no matters if they are indoor or outdoor. Cultivating plants in pots is
the only requirement.</p>
<p><b>Does “battery free” means I don’t have to charge it?</b></p>
<p>Yes, Growiti is energy efficient. You
can power it by using your NFC smartphone or tablet because of its energy
harvesting system. </p>
<p><b>Which smartphone and tablet are supported?</b></p>
<p>Growiti is 100% compatible with all mobile
devices with near field communication (NFC) capability. Click to check the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NFC-enabled_mobile_devices"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>LIST OF NFC-ENABLE DEVICES</span></a>. </p>
<p>Currently we are running on Android
devices. Later Q3, we will finish windows phone compatibility. Apple has not
enabled NFC yet in spite of newest iPhone 6 is equipped with this technology,
but iPhone 6 NFC functionality is expected to open up later.</p>
<p></p><b>Will there be a fee for the service or app?</b>
<p>No, definitely. The service and the
app will be always free for all Growiti’s users.</p>
<p><b>Do I need any tools to install my Growiti?</b></p>
<p>Not at all. The adopted contactless
NFC technology avoids any installation and ongoing maintenance. The Growiti sensor
is buried in your potted plant soil. </p>
<p><b>What about the shipping?</b></p>
<p>Estimated delivered date for testing
model is scheduled on <span>Octuber 2015. Keep in mind this date could change due to production fluctuation.</span></p>
<p><b>What
about sunlight, pH and EC?  </b></p>
<p>Sunlight,
pH and EC are important when you are growing plants, but apply the exact amount
of water is the most important factor to keep your plants healthy. If we reach
our goal with this campaign, we will consider to add more functionalities to
our product.</p>
<p><b>Why is
neccesary to consider the soil type?</b></p>
<p>Soil has pores
which are the spaces that exist between soil particles. In this space may be
water or air. The soil's ability to retain water is strongly related to
particle size; water molecules hold more tightly to the fine particles of
a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>clay</span></a> soil than to coarser particles
of a sandy soil, so clays generally retain more water. </p>
<p>When you
are configuring your plant inside the Growiti app, it will ask you what kind of
soil you have in your pot. This information will be added to our algorithm to
predict when the plant must be watered.</p>
<p><b>Are the
Growiti´s waterproof?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
Growiti was designed to be waterproof.</p>
<p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3><b>Risks and challgenges</b></h3><b></b><div>We recognize that it’s impossible to plan for every risk. But our team deep experiences and skills we can meet any challenge that comes along. <br/>
</div><div>We have already prototyped the product and it works, the technology is proven and we are on the user experience testing stage.

to water. For those who love the data, they can also check percentages, charts,
etc. Growiti becomes the most affordable existing solution.

What makes Growiti to
gain advantage over current solutions arises from its technical features. The
system is battery free, what means battery and charging system are not required
making Growiti energy efficient too. We are manufacturing our prototypes using
a 0.6 mm thickness PCB.  Flexible circuits are more
cost-effective and it can be encapsulated like a label. Plus, the adopted
contactless NFC technology avoids any installation and ongoing maintenance.

What consists the prize of a beta tester of?
You’ll be a part of this exciting
project and get access to the latest before anyone else becoming an early
adopter. Beta testers will take part of the building of Growiti and his name
will be shown on our website. Plus, they will get one unit of Growiti for free on ocassion of the launching if the make a order.

Is this the release candidate?The version of Growiti you'll get is a working prototype. The release candidate will be developed after collected and evaluated
all your opinions.


I’m already a beta tester, what am I supposed to do?
Enjoy the experience and experiment
whilst you take care of your potted plants. At the end of the probationary
period you will voluntary and anonymously fill in an online survey. That’s all.

What can I grow with Growiti?
You can grow any houseplant, both
indoor and outdoor. But please, consider that Growiti only works on potted
plants.
How many plants can I track with my mobile device?
You can install and track so many plants
as you have. Growiti app is not limited to a fix number of sensor.

How big is the soil moisture sensor?
We are building Growiti in a 50x50mm
size.
Where should I bury the soil moisture sensor?
To have a better performance and
avoid noise and signal break down, consider burying your sensor next to the pot
border.

Can I use Growiti in a garden or outdoor?
You can use Growiti exclusively in potted
plants, no matters if they are indoor or outdoor. Cultivating plants in pots is
the only requirement.
Does “battery free” means I don’t have to charge it?
Yes, Growiti is energy efficient. You
can power it by using your NFC smartphone or tablet because of its energy
harvesting system. 
Which smartphone and tablet are supported?
Growiti is 100% compatible with all mobile
devices with near field communication (NFC) capability. Click to check the LIST OF NFC-ENABLE DEVICES. 
Currently we are running on Android
devices. Later Q3, we will finish windows phone compatibility. Apple has not
enabled NFC yet in spite of newest iPhone 6 is equipped with this technology,
but iPhone 6 NFC functionality is expected to open up later.
Will there be a fee for the service or app?
No, definitely. The service and the
app will be always free for all Growiti’s users.
Do I need any tools to install my Growiti?
Not at all. The adopted contactless
NFC technology avoids any installation and ongoing maintenance. The Growiti sensor
is buried in your potted plant soil. 
What about the shipping?
Estimated delivered date for testing
model is scheduled on Octuber 2015. Keep in mind this date could change due to production fluctuation.
What
about sunlight, pH and EC?  
Sunlight,
pH and EC are important when you are growing plants, but apply the exact amount
of water is the most important factor to keep your plants healthy. If we reach
our goal with this campaign, we will consider to add more functionalities to
our product.
Why is
neccesary to consider the soil type?
Soil has pores
which are the spaces that exist between soil particles. In this space may be
water or air. The soil's ability to retain water is strongly related to
particle size; water molecules hold more tightly to the fine particles of
a clay soil than to coarser particles
of a sandy soil, so clays generally retain more water. 
When you
are configuring your plant inside the Growiti app, it will ask you what kind of
soil you have in your pot. This information will be added to our algorithm to
predict when the plant must be watered.
Are the
Growiti´s waterproof?
Yes,
Growiti was designed to be waterproof.
Risks and challgengesWe recognize that it’s impossible to plan for every risk. But our team deep experiences and skills we can meet any challenge that comes along. 
We have already prototyped the product and it works, the technology is proven and we are on the user experience testing stage. We have an experienced team but high-tech products are difficult and problems will arise on order fulfillment. We know that we can deliver within the estimated delivery timeframe.DisclaimerThe pictures of Growiti are of prototypes. Small changes to improve your experience will most definitely occur before you receive your Growiti! Please contact us if you have questions.",29.0,7,"1 Campaign

<p>One day I was sitting by the water, just up from the Harbour. It was a nice sunny day. I saw a man trying to get on his paddle board.The board just kept rolling and moving away from him, on and on, each time he tried. Then he just give up and lay down on his board, let his paddle go and started using his hands to paddle his board. I felt sorry for him. He was not a old man but maybe not a very fit man. This was on my mind so I started looking into it . My research found this to be a huge problem. Paddle boards are like small yachts and a yacht without a keel is not stable and just wants to roll. Paddle boarding  can be very challenging for most of us at any time. To cut a long story short we now have a Stand Up Paddle Keel Board, the Ezyrider. This paddle board will help a lot of people who may find it hard to get started in the sport of paddle boarding.</p>
<p>The project is now at the tooling stage .This will take  2 two 3 weeks. Our 3 D manufacture design is ready for the tooling stage. Production time is two months. Product will be ready for shipping . July / August  2017.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 36px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 40px;background-color: initial;"">Here's How it Works</span><br/></p>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464223756/Indiegogo_How_it_Works_Pic_fcjmwt.png"" src="""" style=""width: 615px;height: 658px;""/></p></div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Tighten and tone core muscles without rigorous exercise or straining your back.  </b>Two things are needed to develop a healthy low back.  Motion and Core muscles working together.  Motion lubricates your spinal joints and brings a lot of circulation to the muscles and nerves that surround your spine.  You can’t build a strong, stable spine by moving in just one plane of motion.  The Core Activator's patented design allows you to exercise on all three planes of motion while maintaining spine neutral position, the strongest position for your spine.  </p>
<p>Whether simply stretching or exercising on the Core Activator your abdominals, obliques, and low back, fire together creating a very powerful set of stabilizer muscles.  This prevents muscle fatigue because more muscles are being used, allowing your body to use less energy.  Pre-activating core muscles in your warm-up  will wake up these stabilizer muscles so they fire during more dynamic moves, such as golf, cycling, lifting or jogging.  With continual core integration exercise, you don’t even have to remember to activate your core.  It becomes automatic, like a reflex. </p>
<h4>Connect hips, Core, and extremities </h4>
<div>The Core Activator teaches you a proper hip hinge which is important for low back health and optimal performance. Physical therapy clinics are busy with clients who have injured their backs due to improper form, muscular imbalances, and deficient movement patterns.  A big problem for many people is how to get the hips to move without the low back flexing along with it. Rounding of the back makes it difficult to activate core muscles and creates pressure on a specific disc making it vulnerable to injury. Spine neutral position will spread the load over multiple discs, meaning less pressure and a stronger and safer position to be in. A proper hip hinge is movement (flexion and extension) through the hip joint that requires keeping a neutral spine. The top pad on the Core Activator helps you maintain safe, spine neutral position throughout the entire exercise. </div>
<div>Think of how many instances a day you may be at risk of rounding.  Sitting at your desk, standing at your desk, brushing your teeth, getting something out of the fridge, picking something up off the floor, getting out of your car, golfing... Using the Core Activator for a few minutes a day will groove proper movement patterns to keep your back healthy and safe. For athletes, mastering the hip hinge will lead to stronger lifts, faster sprints, and more powerful moves. </div>

<br/><h4>Why is the Core Activator better than other methods?</h4>
<div>
<span>Besides taking compression off the spine, the 45-degree angle causes you to hold onto an abdominal brace.  This means that you are engaging abs, obliques, and low back muscles simultaneously, not in isolation.  Through repetition, these muscles learn to fire automatically adding power and stability to your movement. It becomes a reflex for your other activities during the day. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">   </span>
</div>
<div><span>An editorial in Navy Times, recently called for sit-ups to be banned completely. It called them an ‘outdated exercise today viewed as a key cause of lower back injuries’.  The Canadian Armed Forces have already done this as well. If the Army is phasing out sit-ups, maybe you should too. A spokesman for the American Council on Exercise told the Wall St Journal that sit-ups are ‘an antiquity of exercise best left in the dustbin of fitness history’.</span></div>
<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">The Core Activator product technology is patented and is like no other machine on the market.  </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The ability to move the user in forward flexion, lateral flexion, and back extension while in spine neutral position is what makes this machine unique.  The top pad eliminates the mistake of rounding your back.  It takes the stress off the spine and discs to less than body weight.   It increases motion.  It increases resistance yet it decreases the resistance at its most vulnerable position. It activates core muscles all the way around your spine during every exercise, giving you the power to build an enduring healthy low back.</span><br/>

</div>
<div>This is what research shows.  Sitting compresses the spine by nearly twice your body weight. A compressed spine is vulnerable to injury.  Key core muscles shut down when you sit. The 45° of the Core Activator reduces compression load to less than body weight. The angle of the machine causes you to hold onto an abdominal brace.  We used EMG testing to see how core muscles were being utilized and their firing patterns.  The EMGs showed multiple core muscles all the way around the spine activate simultaneously. Once these muscles are trained repetitively to fire together, it then becomes a reflex for daily activities and athletic movements. </div>
<div>

</div>
<div>According to the renowned expert in spine function and injury prevention, Dr. Stuart McGill, ""the staples of most back rehab programs should be <i>eliminated</i> because of the tremendous compressive loading forces that they create through the discs of the spine."" ""Do enough sit-ups, does not matter who you are, you will hurt your discs.""  ""Focusing on a single muscle generally does not enhance stability but creates patterns that result in less stability. It is impossible to train muscles such as transverse abdominis or multifidus in isolation."" The other critical factor, says Dr. McGill, is to ""groove optimal muscle activation patterns."" That is, teach the muscles that stabilize your spine to support your back during any activity, for maximum protection.  (<i>Dr. McGill has been the author of over 200 scientific publications  addressing the low back</i>).  </div>

<div>Muscular strength of trunk is LESS influential in low back pain than co-activation and recruitment patterns. O’Sullivan, PhD<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>According to research presented in the European Journal of Applied Physiology, core muscle activation is limited while performed in a seated position.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) studied 8,000 hourly retail workers for two years. This study found that elastic support back belts did not reduce the incidence of back injury claims or low back pain (Wassell, et al.,2000).</p>

<strong>The concept of Neuroplasticity</strong>:  Neuroplasticity is your brain’s ability to create new neural pathways and reshapes existing ones.  While holding an abdominal brace and performing repetitions we are grooving a neurological pattern.  As we activate core muscles, we exercise an appropriate neurological pathway. The more we exercise that pathway the more efficient that pathway becomes.<br/>
</div>If some of our core muscles go silent or aren't firing appropriately, then the multifidi ( the low back muscle that protects the discs) becomes overactive and eventually fatigues.  Once it fatigues then that muscle is no longer useful and cannot protect the discs.   </div><div>

<h3><b><u>FAQ</u></b></h3>
<p><b>Will the Core Activator improve my bad posture?</b> The Core Activator trains postural muscles and spine stabilizers in the proper kinetic chain sequence, resulting in improved posture. You will feel the results from day one. </p>
<p><b>I am an active athlete with a strong back.  Can I benefit from the Core Activator?</b></p>
<p>We have found that many athletes, even world class athletes, have deficiencies in their core which lead to hamstring, knee and ankle injuries. Several Olympic Athletes have used the Core Activator.  It helped them to tap into hidden core muscles that were not being utilized properly before.  Elite athletes know that in order to maximize power, you need to maximize muscle activation patterns within your core. You can easily train specific skill exercises on the machine such as shoulder/core for pitchers, and arms/core wide receivers, </p>
<p><b>What does it mean to be a better mover?</b></p>
<p>Proper stretching of the muscles along with exercise will help maintain normal range of motion and provide relief for muscles that are suffering disuse atrophy.</p>
<p><b>Can an older person use the Core Activator? </b></p>
<p>After 18 years of age, we humans lose our blood supply to our spines.  After that, the only way to get nutrients in is through motion.  As you age, the spine begins to show wear as the discs dry out, shrink and the space between the discs gets smaller. Good motion into spinal discs hydrates and strengthens the discs, and reduces inflammation and stiffness.  Our oldest user is over 100 years old, and she loves it!</p>
<p><b>I have osteoarthritis.</b></p>
<p>Exercise and hydrating the discs is an important part of OA treatment.  The Core Activator will help decrease joint pain and improve function.  Motion is the life of your spine.</p>
<p><b>I am overweight.  Is the Core Activator a good fit for me?</b></p>
<p>Yes, many times we find overweight individuals have a difficult time exercising on the floor.  The Core Activator is easier to get into position and with more muscles involved in every exercise you will burn more calories and feel results quicker.</p>

<h3>Dr. Jeff's story</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I have sustained many injuries involving severe trauma which required months of rehabilitation. Although my injuries have been severe, they are minute compared to impairments of some of the patients I have treated today. I am very blessed to have the ability to help others.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">As an athlete in high school and college, I suffered many injuries. But, when I broke my back it changed my life.  On February 9, 1980, my good friend Marty Thomas and I went back home for the weekend. While at home, we were driving back from a small get together with friends in a nearby town when a drunk driver crossed the center line and hit </span>us<span style=""background-color: initial;""> head-on. Both drivers were killed, Marty being one of those drivers. I shattered my leg with a compound comminuted fracture and compression fractures of the lumbar spine. Bones were sticking out of my left leg and the bottom of my shoe was facing me. My left leg, with both </span>knees<span style=""background-color: initial;""> fully extended, was approximately 9 inches shorter than my right.  My wounds were deep; psychological greater than physical. Placing my feet on the dashboard right before impact saved my life. No one was wearing seat belts in either vehicle. </span><br/></p>
<div>The doctor who operated on me was a close personal friend of my grandfather. He cleaned all the debris from my ankle and pieced it together as best he could. He told me I would never be able to walk without a limp and if the toes turn black I would lose the limb. I was in a back brace and a leg cast for several months. When those came off, the rehab began. <br/>
</div>
<div>After weeks in the hospital and many more weeks in rehab, I became faster and stronger than I was before.  This led me to find out as much as possible about the science and biomechanics of low back and spinal health. For many years I studied and followed the research from the foremost authorities on back pain and rehab, with specific attention to the work of Dr. Stuart McGill. <br/>
</div>Today, I work with spine and trauma victims for a living and have worked with several world class athletes.  How this all started was, I wanted a low back and core training device that was safe for my spine patients.  Something that placed the user in a spine-friendly position, that didn’t compress the spine and was able to deliver motion into the low back.  And, I was sure that there was something out there that I could buy.  The reality was there was nothing.  One of my patients said that someone should make one then; and I said, yeah someone should…  So I went to work in my garage building a prototype.  </div>
<div>

</div>
<div>What started out as a simple low back machine has turned into a lot more.  I was working with some Olympic athletes that were coming off injuries and we started finding more and more uses and implementations for the machine.  We knew that in order to maximize our power, we needed to maximize muscle activation patterns within our core. So, we started testing all sorts of exercises using EMG technology.  EMG stands for electromyography.  An EMG measures the electrical activity of muscles and their contraction.  The EMG was showing the Core Activator was readily activating multiple core muscles.  The athletes were able to activate abs and obliques as well as low back all at the same time.  So I rounded up some friends and we got to work placing units within different walks of life. </div>

<div>A Major League Baseball team started integrating our machine into their core training and therapy programs. Other users included the US Air Marshals, physical therapists, and chiropractors.  We brought it to a biomechanics laboratory at a major university for analysis and then we met Doc Suttie. Doc is one of the top PGA golf instructors in the world and is a doctor of biomechanics.  He has had 3 back operations.  Well, Doc now has a Core Activator at each of his training locations and is a big fan of our product. He claims to be two inches taller now. <br/>
</div>
<div>The spine patients that I work with had the neural pathways still intact, but their prognosis was not good. These young men had been in their wheelchairs for 2 years and up to 10 years for one patient. All are walking today!

</div></div>","Introducing the Core Activator
Core muscle activation in every exercise Finally, a fitness machine designed as a lasting solution for a healthy backThis patented machine is the first to move you in all three planes of motion, take compression loads off of your spine, and activate multiple core muscles around your spine; all while keeping you in a safer/more powerful spine neutral position.The Core Activator was created out of necessity by Dr. Jeff Fishel after several paraplegic spine patients came to his practice to train their core. They all had the prognosis of life in a wheelchair and needed to strengthen core muscles to make easier transitions to and from the wheelchair. But traditional exercise machines have the user seated, which places harmful compression on the spine and shuts down key core muscles. Dr. Jeff found that there was nothing on the market that was safe for his patients, so he built one himself.  And, the results have been amazing! See Dr. Jeff's Story at the end of the campaign.Anyone with back pain can benefit from the Core Activator. You can choose to wear braces and use ergonomic chairs to lessen the pain, but that is not a long term solution.  Bracing restricts movement, and movement is necessary for keeping joints and muscles healthy and pain-free.  Most lower back pain can be prevented with the correct exercise of the core muscles that SURROUND the spine and this is exactly what the Core Activator was designed to deliver.   

What separates the Core Activator from the competition?
Conventional machines: (i.e. MedX) 


Seated position; spine is compressed by nearly 2x body weight
Inhibits anterior core muscles from activating
Muscle isolation
Inhibits pelvic motion
Eliminates the Kinetic chain (no hamstrings or glutes)
Separate flexion, extension, stretching machines

Core Activator:


Not seated: reduces spine compression to less than body weight
Works synergistic core muscle belt 
Engages multiple core muscles 360° around the spine
Allows normal functional pelvic motion
Incorporates kinetic chain, including hamstrings and glutes (unless you are in a wheelchair glutes and hamstrings need to be activated for optimal spinal health) 
Stretches and strengthens in all 3 planes of motion (forward flexion, extension, lateral) 

Low back extension machines are damaging to the spine (Dr. Stuart McGill and Dr. Callahan 2007)


Core Activator Benefits 

Ease Back Pain - Motion is essential for a healthy spine. Core muscles working together has lasting positive effects on low back health. 
Maintain Low Back Health - A few minutes a day will build muscle memory for more efficient movement patterns linking core to your extremities.
Improve Posture - Strengthens and links postural muscles 360 degrees around your spine.
Burn More Calories - More muscles firing increases caloric burn.
Increase Power and Endurance - Training to recruit core in every exercise brings powerful stabilizing muscles to every task.
Release Tension - Stretches multiple muscle groups from calves, hamstrings, glutes, low back and core, through your shoulder girdle. 
Breathe Better - Your diaphragm is the main muscle for respiration and sits at the top of your core. It is exercised on this machine. 
Tone Love Handles - Can you tighten your love handles? You will now!


Here's How it Works


Tighten and tone core muscles without rigorous exercise or straining your back.  Two things are needed to develop a healthy low back.  Motion and Core muscles working together.  Motion lubricates your spinal joints and brings a lot of circulation to the muscles and nerves that surround your spine.  You can’t build a strong, stable spine by moving in just one plane of motion.  The Core Activator's patented design allows you to exercise on all three planes of motion while maintaining spine neutral position, the strongest position for your spine.  
Whether simply stretching or exercising on the Core Activator your abdominals, obliques, and low back, fire together creating a very powerful set of stabilizer muscles.  This prevents muscle fatigue because more muscles are being used, allowing your body to use less energy.  Pre-activating core muscles in your warm-up  will wake up these stabilizer muscles so they fire during more dynamic moves, such as golf, cycling, lifting or jogging.  With continual core integration exercise, you don’t even have to remember to activate your core.  It becomes automatic, like a reflex. 
Connect hips, Core, and extremities 
The Core Activator teaches you a proper hip hinge which is important for low back health and optimal performance. Physical therapy clinics are busy with clients who have injured their backs due to improper form, muscular imbalances, and deficient movement patterns.  A big problem for many people is how to get the hips to move without the low back flexing along with it. Rounding of the back makes it difficult to activate core muscles and creates pressure on a specific disc making it vulnerable to injury. Spine neutral position will spread the load over multiple discs, meaning less pressure and a stronger and safer position to be in. A proper hip hinge is movement (flexion and extension) through the hip joint that requires keeping a neutral spine. The top pad on the Core Activator helps you maintain safe, spine neutral position throughout the entire exercise. 
Think of how many instances a day you may be at risk of rounding.  Sitting at your desk, standing at your desk, brushing your teeth, getting something out of the fridge, picking something up off the floor, getting out of your car, golfing... Using the Core Activator for a few minutes a day will groove proper movement patterns to keep your back healthy and safe. For athletes, mastering the hip hinge will lead to stronger lifts, faster sprints, and more powerful moves. 







Do you sit all day at work? 

Unchanging posture leads to decreased fluid and nutrition exchange in the spinal discs.  If you can, every couple of hours get on the Core Activator and do 10-15 repetitions in each range of motion as long as there is no pain in that range of motion.  Do this daily to reverse the negative effects of sitting.

Don’t have the time, just do forward flexion two times a day. 





""Studies have found that sedentary behavior, including sitting for extended periods, increases the risk for developing dozens of chronic conditions...""               ~ The Wall Street Journal
Reverses the Negative Effects of Sitting:  Use the Core Activator throughout the day to stretch and deliver motion into your spine and low back.  In minutes you will feel tension release and elasticity return.   Motion into your spine and low back muscles will help restore and repair the damage that has been done. Daily Stretches and Exercises Video
Keys to a Healthy Back
1. Get motion into your low back muscles and spine daily2. Learn to hip hinge – spine neutral position 3. Teach core muscles to activate together automatically4. Reduce the compression load on your spine while exercising

It's for everyone, regardless of fitness level
Athletes are finding this machine to be an effective tool for warm-up prior to play as well as building repetitive, powerful movements. Seniors can perform various exercises with ease, improving stamina and balance; see short video.  Personal trainers and physical therapists can use the Core Activator as part of their toolkit.  We are adding features that will allow easy use in hospital room situation for geriatric physical therapy.  It is collapsible for easy storage and the built in rollers make it easy to move. 


Why is the Core Activator better than other methods?

Besides taking compression off the spine, the 45-degree angle causes you to hold onto an abdominal brace.  This means that you are engaging abs, obliques, and low back muscles simultaneously, not in isolation.  Through repetition, these muscles learn to fire automatically adding power and stability to your movement. It becomes a reflex for your other activities during the day.    

An editorial in Navy Times, recently called for sit-ups to be banned completely. It called them an ‘outdated exercise today viewed as a key cause of lower back injuries’.  The Canadian Armed Forces have already done this as well. If the Army is phasing out sit-ups, maybe you should too. A spokesman for the American Council on Exercise told the Wall St Journal that sit-ups are ‘an antiquity of exercise best left in the dustbin of fitness history’.

The Core Activator product technology is patented and is like no other machine on the market.  The ability to move the user in forward flexion, lateral flexion, and back extension while in spine neutral position is what makes this machine unique.  The top pad eliminates the mistake of rounding your back.  It takes the stress off the spine and discs to less than body weight.   It increases motion.  It increases resistance yet it decreases the resistance at its most vulnerable position. It activates core muscles all the way around your spine during every exercise, giving you the power to build an enduring healthy low back.


Get Stronger with a Core Integration Workout 

Imagine for a moment that your body had no individual muscles, no isolated muscle groups. This is actually how your body moves in nature; on multiple planes. That is why we designed the Core Activator to allow you to exercise on all three planes of motion. 
There are plenty of core exercises out there that you can do on your own.  But, you won't really know if you are doing them correctly.  The Core Activator takes all of the guessing (and possible injury) and hard work out of it. You can't mess up.  It grooves proper movement patterns.  It's the only machine on the market to makes this so easy and effective. 
On this one piece of equipment, you can train Cardio (HIIT), Strength, Explosiveness, Balance, and Stretching. 
After 30 days using the Core Activator you will feel taller, lighter, and move with more power.  The obliques (love handles or muffin tops) have been a difficult muscle to get tone until now.  Use it for a month and you will be able to tighten those love handles on command. 
Four Machines in One - no matter what exercise you do, you link core

Core Activation and Golf 
Safely stretch hamstrings, hips, low back, upper back, and shoulder girdle while pre-activating core muscles prior to you round.  Core stabilization allows you to control your body statically and dynamically during the golf swing. Rotational exercises on the Core Activator are simply better and safer. Training core muscles to fire automatically will give you a more powerful, repetitive swing and increase your endurance.

Highlights 




Spine Neutral Position - The safest and most powerful position your spine can be in. 
Reduces Compression on Spine and Low Back - A compressed spine is vulnerable to injury. The 45-degree angle reduces compression load to less than body weight (sitting is 180% of body weight). 

Proper Hip Hinge - The top pad keeps you in spine neutral position during the entire exercise movement. Spares the spine. Allows for kinetic transfer of energy/force to the upper body. 

Daily Warm Up Tool - Wake up core muscles prior to golf, jogging, or any dynamic exercise
Wide Range of Use - For everyone from seniors to elite athletes, trainers, therapists, and hospitals
Compact Design - Folds easily to roll under bed or put in closet

The Science Behind the Design 

This is what research shows.  Sitting compresses the spine by nearly twice your body weight. A compressed spine is vulnerable to injury.  Key core muscles shut down when you sit. The 45° of the Core Activator reduces compression load to less than body weight. The angle of the machine causes you to hold onto an abdominal brace.  We used EMG testing to see how core muscles were being utilized and their firing patterns.  The EMGs showed multiple core muscles all the way around the spine activate simultaneously. Once these muscles are trained repetitively to fire together, it then becomes a reflex for daily activities and athletic movements. 



According to the renowned expert in spine function and injury prevention, Dr. Stuart McGill, ""the staples of most back rehab programs should be eliminated because of the tremendous compressive loading forces that they create through the discs of the spine."" ""Do enough sit-ups, does not matter who you are, you will hurt your discs.""  ""Focusing on a single muscle generally does not enhance stability but creates patterns that result in less stability. It is impossible to train muscles such as transverse abdominis or multifidus in isolation."" The other critical factor, says Dr. McGill, is to ""groove optimal muscle activation patterns."" That is, teach the muscles that stabilize your spine to support your back during any activity, for maximum protection.  (Dr. McGill has been the author of over 200 scientific publications  addressing the low back).  

People with low back pain find it difficult to engage core muscles without repetitive help. Hodges, Ph.D.  Arch. of Physical Med. Rehab


Muscular strength of trunk is LESS influential in low back pain than co-activation and recruitment patterns. O’Sullivan, PhD


According to research presented in the European Journal of Applied Physiology, core muscle activation is limited while performed in a seated position.


The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) studied 8,000 hourly retail workers for two years. This study found that elastic support back belts did not reduce the incidence of back injury claims or low back pain (Wassell, et al.,2000).



The concept of Neuroplasticity:  Neuroplasticity is your brain’s ability to create new neural pathways and reshapes existing ones.  While holding an abdominal brace and performing repetitions we are grooving a neurological pattern.  As we activate core muscles, we exercise an appropriate neurological pathway. The more we exercise that pathway the more efficient that pathway becomes.
If some of our core muscles go silent or aren't firing appropriately, then the multifidi ( the low back muscle that protects the discs) becomes overactive and eventually fatigues.  Once it fatigues then that muscle is no longer useful and cannot protect the discs.   



TESTIMONIALS 
Dr. Michael Torry Ph.D. (Director, Biomechanics Laboratory at Illinois State University):  “The science speaks for itself.  When we do traditional core exercises, we put unnecessary loads on the spine.  Tighten the Core equipment allows us to exercise the core muscles, the erector spinae, and the abdominals, in the proper sequence and also take the load off the spine.  That’s a win – win exercise.”  Mike was elected to the prestigious National Academy of Science Keck Futures Initiative in 2007 and currently serves as a Society Representative the US National Committee on Biomechanics
 
Dr. Jim Suttie - PGA National Teacher of the Year 2000; Golf Digest's 50 Greatest Teachers List and  instructor to several tour professionals.  ""The Core Activator absolutely could help anyone with a back problem in golf. It will help you stand up straighter and give you more stability.  I never really found a product, until I found this one, that really helped my back.""




 

""I love the Core Activator""



“Tighten the Core equipment significantly improves athlete performance by engaging and activating core muscles unlike any other equipment available. This equipment will help athletes to perform at a higher level.” Randy Ballard – Olympic Trainer and Athletic Trainer University of Illinois

“We have used the Core Activator equipment for several years with great results.” Herm Schneider, Chicago White Sox Head Trainer

Dr. Jeff has several patients that were paraplegic and are now walking today. One patient was in a wheelchair for over 10 years!  They put a lot of hard work into walking again and the Core Activator was a vital tool in their therapy.

FAQ
Will the Core Activator improve my bad posture? The Core Activator trains postural muscles and spine stabilizers in the proper kinetic chain sequence, resulting in improved posture. You will feel the results from day one. 
I am an active athlete with a strong back.  Can I benefit from the Core Activator?
We have found that many athletes, even world class athletes, have deficiencies in their core which lead to hamstring, knee and ankle injuries. Several Olympic Athletes have used the Core Activator.  It helped them to tap into hidden core muscles that were not being utilized properly before.  Elite athletes know that in order to maximize power, you need to maximize muscle activation patterns within your core. You can easily train specific skill exercises on the machine such as shoulder/core for pitchers, and arms/core wide receivers, 
What does it mean to be a better mover?
Proper stretching of the muscles along with exercise will help maintain normal range of motion and provide relief for muscles that are suffering disuse atrophy.
Can an older person use the Core Activator? 
After 18 years of age, we humans lose our blood supply to our spines.  After that, the only way to get nutrients in is through motion.  As you age, the spine begins to show wear as the discs dry out, shrink and the space between the discs gets smaller. Good motion into spinal discs hydrates and strengthens the discs, and reduces inflammation and stiffness.  Our oldest user is over 100 years old, and she loves it!
I have osteoarthritis.
Exercise and hydrating the discs is an important part of OA treatment.  The Core Activator will help decrease joint pain and improve function.  Motion is the life of your spine.
I am overweight.  Is the Core Activator a good fit for me?
Yes, many times we find overweight individuals have a difficult time exercising on the floor.  The Core Activator is easier to get into position and with more muscles involved in every exercise you will burn more calories and feel results quicker.
Next in the Pipeline
This isn't a one trick pony.  The Assisted Squat Machine is next in the pipeline. Maintain perfect squat form while taking the compression off your back, knee joints, ankle joints, and hips.  Perfect for someone that is rehabbing low back, hip, knee, or ankle surgery. The Assisted Squat is a great tool to progressively move into more dynamic and heavier load movements. We have blueprints for a dozen other spine friendly pieces of equipment, but we need your help! 



Dr. Jeff's story


I have sustained many injuries involving severe trauma which required months of rehabilitation. Although my injuries have been severe, they are minute compared to impairments of some of the patients I have treated today. I am very blessed to have the ability to help others.
As an athlete in high school and college, I suffered many injuries. But, when I broke my back it changed my life.  On February 9, 1980, my good friend Marty Thomas and I went back home for the weekend. While at home, we were driving back from a small get together with friends in a nearby town when a drunk driver crossed the center line and hit us head-on. Both drivers were killed, Marty being one of those drivers. I shattered my leg with a compound comminuted fracture and compression fractures of the lumbar spine. Bones were sticking out of my left leg and the bottom of my shoe was facing me. My left leg, with both knees fully extended, was approximately 9 inches shorter than my right.  My wounds were deep; psychological greater than physical. Placing my feet on the dashboard right before impact saved my life. No one was wearing seat belts in either vehicle. 
The doctor who operated on me was a close personal friend of my grandfather. He cleaned all the debris from my ankle and pieced it together as best he could. He told me I would never be able to walk without a limp and if the toes turn black I would lose the limb. I was in a back brace and a leg cast for several months. When those came off, the rehab began. 

After weeks in the hospital and many more weeks in rehab, I became faster and stronger than I was before.  This led me to find out as much as possible about the science and biomechanics of low back and spinal health. For many years I studied and followed the research from the foremost authorities on back pain and rehab, with specific attention to the work of Dr. Stuart McGill. 
Today, I work with spine and trauma victims for a living and have worked with several world class athletes.  How this all started was, I wanted a low back and core training device that was safe for my spine patients.  Something that placed the user in a spine-friendly position, that didn’t compress the spine and was able to deliver motion into the low back.  And, I was sure that there was something out there that I could buy.  The reality was there was nothing.  One of my patients said that someone should make one then; and I said, yeah someone should…  So I went to work in my garage building a prototype.  



What started out as a simple low back machine has turned into a lot more.  I was working with some Olympic athletes that were coming off injuries and we started finding more and more uses and implementations for the machine.  We knew that in order to maximize our power, we needed to maximize muscle activation patterns within our core. So, we started testing all sorts of exercises using EMG technology.  EMG stands for electromyography.  An EMG measures the electrical activity of muscles and their contraction.  The EMG was showing the Core Activator was readily activating multiple core muscles.  The athletes were able to activate abs and obliques as well as low back all at the same time.  So I rounded up some friends and we got to work placing units within different walks of life. 
            
A Major League Baseball team started integrating our machine into their core training and therapy programs. Other users included the US Air Marshals, physical therapists, and chiropractors.  We brought it to a biomechanics laboratory at a major university for analysis and then we met Doc Suttie. Doc is one of the top PGA golf instructors in the world and is a doctor of biomechanics.  He has had 3 back operations.  Well, Doc now has a Core Activator at each of his training locations and is a big fan of our product. He claims to be two inches taller now. 

The spine patients that I work with had the neural pathways still intact, but their prognosis was not good. These young men had been in their wheelchairs for 2 years and up to 10 years for one patient. All are walking today! See their stories here.

<p><strong>Fasting, Living Feeding and return of</strong></p>
<p><strong>my organic and spiritual health! </strong></p>
<p>written by LibrSpirit on 01 December 2015 at 11h18</p>
<p>Having gone through a huge sickness, i turned naturally towards therapeutical fasting, livin feeding and a return to my health. It had been many years since I was vegetarian, almost raw vegan and for 2 years now I feed on vegetable juices, sometimes during juice fasts or with every day meals (even if my body only has one meal a day, it is enough). I am a big fan of fasting, very long ones (45, 32 or 28 days for example). I also learned to develop and awake my soul and spirit and reconnect with nature, and small things, which are the most vital. I don't refuse everything in conventional medicine though. However I have learned the wonders of plants, and its products in our organism (physical and spiritual). We are our own healers, our own shamans, and doctors can help us, but we are the one and only actors of our psychic, physical and emotional health. What we absorb (food, environment, emotions) is vital for the body and spirit. We are one!</p>
<p>I am really thankful to Thierry who does a wonderful job in his site and he is a wonderful soul! The tips on vegetable juices, and cold soups are also great and very helpful! Thanks to the whole Regenere Team. It's only with my best wishes that I  confirm my transition passage from a nasty nutrition towards a healthy one. This also means spiritual awakening, because I think one cannot go without the other. We can heal our body, but if we don't worry about our soul and spirit, emotional blocks will always be there to create sicknesses. Thank you all! </p>
<p>My objectif in Terra Incognita will bring me a fasting with vegeable juices and medical plants (3 juices and 3 teas every day). </p>
<p>Great effort you guys  and I wish you all a great experience!</p>
<p>I am filled with positive emotions and love!!! </p>

 Regenere, spreading lifefrom within you!




In a glimpse, I want to subtitle the videos of Regenere, and I want to fund me doing it through you :) Maybe there are other campaigns that need the money more, so you can go to another one, but I need the money to teach you how to avoid chronic deseases like cancer, diabetes, etc. I think if we all start doing our part to kill cancer cells inside ourselves, the cancer outside ourselves (pollution, economy, social, political unrest) can be solved little by little!

Thanks!

One of the 847 testimonies at Regenere.org
Fasting, Living Feeding and return of
my organic and spiritual health! 
written by LibrSpirit on 01 December 2015 at 11h18
Having gone through a huge sickness, i turned naturally towards therapeutical fasting, livin feeding and a return to my health. It had been many years since I was vegetarian, almost raw vegan and for 2 years now I feed on vegetable juices, sometimes during juice fasts or with every day meals (even if my body only has one meal a day, it is enough). I am a big fan of fasting, very long ones (45, 32 or 28 days for example). I also learned to develop and awake my soul and spirit and reconnect with nature, and small things, which are the most vital. I don't refuse everything in conventional medicine though. However I have learned the wonders of plants, and its products in our organism (physical and spiritual). We are our own healers, our own shamans, and doctors can help us, but we are the one and only actors of our psychic, physical and emotional health. What we absorb (food, environment, emotions) is vital for the body and spirit. We are one!
I am really thankful to Thierry who does a wonderful job in his site and he is a wonderful soul! The tips on vegetable juices, and cold soups are also great and very helpful! Thanks to the whole Regenere Team. It's only with my best wishes that I  confirm my transition passage from a nasty nutrition towards a healthy one. This also means spiritual awakening, because I think one cannot go without the other. We can heal our body, but if we don't worry about our soul and spirit, emotional blocks will always be there to create sicknesses. Thank you all! 
My objectif in Terra Incognita will bring me a fasting with vegeable juices and medical plants (3 juices and 3 teas every day). 
Great effort you guys  and I wish you all a great experience!
I am filled with positive emotions and love!!! 

Do you know why milk is not the best? 
Do you know how gluten affects your body and ultimately leads to chronic fatigue, inmune diseases and cancer?
Some of you may already know Thierry Casanovas from the REGENERE.org site, but for those of you who don't, please watch this video, I promess you the video is an eye opener and you will not regret watching it carefully! 


Thanks for watching! 
If you didn't watch, then go back! It is essential to understand how your stomac works if you want to help relieve cancer in the world! It is far too complicated for me to explain it here. That is why I would like you to watch the video... Thanks! 
Now that you have understood the basic principles of natural laws,  the same laws that govern fungus, microbes, nature and Human Beings as well...

Keep on reading! 


Thierry is the representative of the REGENERE movement in France. It aims to return individual autonomy and empowerment to every human being. They have come up with a nutrition model that makes the one we have right now totally useless! You know, the one where we eat meat, milk and bread... Find the first steps towards this new nutrition here. 



Already 62,000 people are following Regenere Youtube channel, which counts nearly 16 million views , it's now going global with your help! 


2. Thank you Regenere 
for saving my life!

Before at 26 yo (2009) 


Now at 33 yo! (look at the difference in my smile and brightness in eyes)



I plan to translate  as fast as possible between 40 and 60 videos from Thierry in both English and Spanish in 4 months. You will be able to check them out, here

Videos like this one:

I will also translate the 6 step guide to regeneration, with tips to have a diet transition with success! Please find here, the first steps! 

The movement is going international, thanks to you and me, but first we need you to help funding it!

 I thank you for helping me! 




We can make the difference! 
Now what, let's talk business... :)

3. Financing (ETA 4 months)*




The financing which will last 4 months will go to:


Regenere                                        
Transcription from Voice to Script and authorship of videos .......................... 20%
(Or $51 per video)Honoraries of 2 Native Translators in English and Spanish:  
Subtitling of 60-80 videos to English and Spanish...............................................40%    (Or $51 per video)
Responsible: Javier Lara
Revising and subtitling of 60-80 videos and Quality Assurance .........................20%Fundraising and Campaign Marketing......................................................................20%(Or $102 per video)
   Total $18000

*DISCLAIMER- I understand pricing is high, but bare in mind that each video takes around 20 hours to be transcribed, syncd, translated and proofread! So this means that each person will be working $10 per hour! 
- If I get to 25% of my objective, Regenere will get 5% and I will not hire any translator.
- If I get to 50% of my objective, Regenere will get 10% and I will hire 1 translator.          
4. Linguistic Experience 

I don't pretend to say that there aren't better people for this job, but they are not as motivated as I am! 

2001 : BAC économique Lycée Francais @ San Salvador, El Salvador.
2006: BA in International Business NMSU @ New Mexico US 
2012: Master I International Management @IAE Toulouse - France
2012: Translation of 45000 words from www.UZplaces.com ; Spanish - English.
2013: English Teacher Diploma @ UNAM (México DF - México) 2014: Translation of the book ""Despierta paz"" from Renee Salinas ; Spanish - French.
2014: Approved HSK3 Intermediate Level Chinese Proficiency Test. 
2014: Revision of Chinese Novels Liljana Arsovska Mo Yan ; Chinese - Spanish.
2014: Translation of the ""short tale"" ""an enigmatic smile"". Chinese - Spanish. 
2016: Sous titrage de la vidéo Mon meilleur conseil de santé (pas encore live) et sous titrage de 30 minutes pour changer une vie.  
Linguistic Combination: Spanish A  English B French B  




I understand the sum might be a lot of money, but subtitling these videos is hard work, and this project deserves every dollar in the world! 
There are some obstacles in the way since my ankle and lumbar column are hurt from a car accident, but again, I don't fear this because I feel guided to do this and no activity is more fun than translating microcellular wisdom as of now! 
If you cannot collaborate with money, but you want to help in any way, you can also share my campaign in whatever social network you want! Remember to use Indiegogo's own tools!




  A big thank you to you! 

  Without you, I am, but together we are strong!

1. Intro 
Est-ce que tu connais les effets de la viande dans ton corps? 
Du lait?
Est-ce que tu sais pourquoi ce n'est pas le meilleur de les manger?
 Est-ce que tu connais comment le gluten se colle dans ton estomac et peut occasioner de maladies autoimmunes, fatigue chronique et un cancer? 

Quelques uns d'entre vous peut être  déjà  connaissent Thierry Casanovas, mais pour ceux d'entre vous qui ne le connaissent pas encore REGENERE, SVP faites click ici. 
Merci d'avoir vu la vidéo! 




Maintenant que vous avez vu la video et vous comprenez les principes de base des lois naturelles, les mêmes lois qui gouvernent les microbes, les virus, la nature, et donc l'Etre Humain...je t'invite à aider la planete à avoir cette sagesse! 
Lisez la suite s'il vous plaît,
Thierry est le représentant du mouvement Regenere en France. Son objectif est de retourner l'autonomie individuelle de chaque individu au niveau de la santé, mode de vie et permaculture. Ils ont tout un modèle de transition qui remplace celui d'avant (avec de la viande, produits laitiers et du pain) et vous pouvez le voir ici. C'est seulement une guide et c'est à chaqun de le personaliser dans son cadre bien spécifique!




Il y a déja 62,000 personnes qui suivent la chaine Youtube de Regenere, avec 16 millions de vues. Ce-ci a augmenté depuis 5 années et maintenant on est responsable que toute la planete sache cette sagesse! 



2. Merci Regenere pour sauver ma vie 

Avant (2009)
26 ans




Maintenant (2016)
33 ans avec un gran et VRAI sourire!




Comme pour certains d'entre vous, ce mouvement a sauvé ma vie (celle de Javier Lara) du gluten et des produits laitiers, qui étaient en train de tuer l'énergie de mon corps. Je remercie vivement Thierry et tout le mouvement Regenere pour améliorer ma vie! 

La traduction de 40 à 60 vidéos se fera au plus tôt possible, et tous ceux qui contribuent auront droit à toutes les traductions le jour même où elles seront publiès.  Des vidéos ont été déjà traduites et tu peux les voir ici.




Des vidéos comme celle-ci: 
Ce mouvement va prendre un essort international, grâce à toi et moi, mais nous avons besoin que tu aides premier! Moi je le ferrai de toute facon, mais tu peux le manifester beaucoup plus rapidement... Tu es l'unique responsable que ce-ci soit une realité! Es-tu à l'hauteur? 
On va parler de sous maintenant...!





3. Financement*

La traduction ne sera pas facile puisqu'il y a beaucoup de vidéos. Aussi, mon pied, colonne lumbaire et cervicale ne sont pas au meilleur état après un accident de voiture. Mais encore une fois je me sens guidé vers ce projet, c'est donc ma responsabilité, qui va le faire sinon?  

Si tu ne peux pas collaborer avec de l'argent, mais tu veux toujours aider, tu pourrait me metre en contact avec de traducteurs natifs d'Espagnol ou Anglais! Tu peux aussi partager ma campagne aux résaux sociaux... rappels-toi d'utiliser les outils Indiegogo!

Ahora (2016)

Como para algunos de ustedes, este movimiento significó salvar mi vida del gluten y los productos lácteos, que estaban matando la energía dentro de mi cuerpo y le agradezco a Thierry y todo el movimiento Regenere por mejorar mi vida! Siento que es mi responsabilidad el difundir el mensaje Regenere a todo el planeta, y además no puedo pensar en nada más divertido que traducir sabidurìa microcelular! Lo harìa gratis pero necesito dinero para comprar frutas y vegetales! 



La traducción de 60  a 80 vídeos se hará lo más pronto posible, y todos los que contribuyan recibirán un update con el video apenas est´r traducido, y también los podrán ver en la página de Regenere International. 

Podemos hacer la diferencia, pero primero debes ser tú el que me ayuda. Del resto me ocupo yo... Estás a la altura de ayudarme?

<h3>Facts About Komega6</h3>
<p>We are an established start-up with a proven record of delivering quality health &amp; wellness products to market and are asking backers to help us with funding our newly designed product-line extension—introducing our new carrier blend featuring CBD oil (from hemp-seed oil); in return, backers will receive deepened discounts and a chance to be the first to try the latest and greatest products from komega6. </p>
<ul>
<li>We have been in business for <strong>3 years</strong> — &amp; retain a positive presence on amazon.com, zulily.com &amp; walmart.com </li>
<li>This is our <strong>1st official product line extension</strong> primarily focusing on revamping our core product line of blended topical oils.</li>
<li>We are <strong>asking backers</strong> to help us fund the <strong>procurement</strong> of <strong>components</strong> and <strong>raw materials</strong> to mass-produce our second generation of essential oil-based products featuring CBD oil.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>After much feedback from our customers and vendors, we have gone back to the lab &amp; developed what we feel to be a superior upgrade to our already established topical essential oil blend line. Needless to say, we are very excited to share them with customers; both new and those that are already familiar with our brand.</i></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need funding to help us purchase raw materials &amp; components at increased volume. </p>
<ul>
<li>Our small startup business up to this point has been entirely passion-funded by direct sales and humble amounts of owner financing.</li>
<li>Komega6 is asking for $25,000 to support us in reaching a larger volume of raw-material &amp; bottle component procurement orders — this is intended to give us broader brand exposure and also to increase our per-unit profitability, primarily for the purpose of attracting potential investors. </li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<ul><li>We are promising backers with the delivery of your choice of perk containing variances of our core 5 - essential oil blends.  Our blends are pre-mixed essential oil blends that are blended with our topical carrier oil blend (trademark pending) — featuring hemp oil, argan oil, &amp; coconut oil. Some perks will include bonus option gifts such as bath salts or apparel. </li></ul>
<h3>""Stretch Goals"" — the backers' bonus*</h3>
<ul><li>Funding provided*, our backers will also get the possibility of being the first to back and receive our extended ""stretch goal"" offerings of essential oil diffuser blends, pure oils, soaps, and pillow sprays stated for out planned product-pipeline. Our Stretch goals will be posted once we determine the success of the campaign and its feasibility. Repeat backers will provide hidden perks for even deepened discounts. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The majority of backer-risk is reduced in our proven track record and already established procurement &amp; manufacturing processes. There is always a risk in regards to crowd-funding. Such as time restraints and financial planning pitfalls. We have dedicated much time and resources to the planning and launching of this campaign to alleviate potential issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bulk of our product research and design is already complete</li>
<li>Pre-planning pertaining to material procurement &amp; manufacturing procedures have been pre-established; raw materials &amp; bottle components have been price-negotiated &amp; ready-to-go with provided funding.</li>
<li>We have established a launch plan with our vendors to alleviate operational short-comings pertaining to Logistics, Manufacturing &amp; Financial processes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><h3>Fulfillment</h3><p>Our projected fulfillment window goals are from Sep-Nov 2018, we feel this time-frame gives us time in order to order raw materials to have direct shipped to our manufacturing partner, manufacture and bottle backers products, quality check, and then send off to a 3rd party fulfillment center to be fulfilled to backers. There may be instances where problems come array during these processes, we are committed to full transparency in our process and will keep backers updated on critical news pertaining to their order. Some contingencies may include the following and should be expected.</p><ul>
<li>We will not receive funding and order totals until 15+ after this campaign ends.</li>
<li>We will not have total order details on perks such as tee shirt sizes and scent variables from order to order until after the campaign has ended and we have reached out to backers for clarification on the details of their purchased perk — for example, shirt sizes and scents preferred. This may take several weeks to obtain all this information and will impact order forecasting thus causing delays.</li>
<li>Our manufacturer may have commitments to complete other clients before our manufacturing &amp; bottling runs because we cannot currently commit to a hard-line order amount and run date at this very moment our manufacturing timeline may be subject to changes.</li>
<li>The same instance goes for a third party shipping provider for order fulfillment. In a worst-case scenario, we have our own shipping processes in place that meets our current fulfillment demands. With that being said, we will personally ship orders if need-be but will plan for a more streamlined approach.</li>
</ul><h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p> </p><p><strong>Isn't CBD oil illegal in most states?</strong></p><p>There is a TON of misinformation pertaining to CBD oil, what it is, and it's legality. But the short answer is, no CBD is not illegal for distribution within the U.S., It is illegal for production and processing in several states in the U.S., this is due to its relationship with the marijuana plant itself (you can't legally grow marijuana in most U.S. states).</p><p>CBD or Cannabidiol is found in many parts of the cannabis plant, but its legality is only affected by its sourcing stemming from the part of the plant it is extracted from (any oil extracted from marijuana leaves and stems are considered illegal in most non-participating states due to the potential cross-contamination with the illegal psychoactive oil, THC).</p><p>In our case, we are using CBD derived from Hemp Seed Oil (small amounts of CBD is found in hemp seed oil) Hemp Seed oil does not contain THC, or any other illegal substance. Our Hemp Seed oil is sourced out of Canada, where it is perfectly legal to extract and export.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Are Komega6 products organic?</strong></p><p>Technically speaking, yes, all of our products consist of raw organic oils that are produced from cold-pressed or steam distilled extraction processes. At this very moment, we have not paid for any official certificates stating that our products are organic, but we assure you that they are.</p><p><strong>Do you grow your own essential oils? Where do they come from?</strong></p><p>No, much like every other essential oil brand, we obtain our oils via distribution — all of our raw materials including our essential oils come with certificates of analysis proving their quality. We are committed to only using high-quality essential oils in our products and will make these certificates available via our website once obtained. The oils are sourced from farms from all over the globe and provided to us via a network of distribution partners accompanied with information that provides us with their region of origin. </p><p><b>Are your oils for consumption?</b></p><p>Although our oils may be safe to consume for most, we do not recommend consuming them as they are designed specifically for topical use.</p><p><b>Can you use komega6 topical blends in a diffuser?</b></p><p>Due to the inclusion of the carrier oils in our blends, we do not recommend distilling our topical blend oils. But you can if you really want to... Effects may vary.</p><p><b>Wil I get a rash from applying the oils topically?</b></p><p>All of our blends have been tested on multiple subjects to cut back on the risk of skin irritants. But in some cases, an individual may be particularly sensitive to an oil. If you have any known allergens to any of the oils listed on the label, we suggest not applying and contacting us for a replacement or refund.</p><p><b>What do I do if I have an allergic reaction to a topical blend?</b></p><p>Please contact your doctor immediately for any medical related advice. </p><p><b>What if I do not like a scent or have a bad experience with a blend?</b></p><p>Please contact us directly through our website support email provided on komega6.com and ask us for either a replacement or a refund.</p><p><b>Do you ship abroad?</b></p><p>Yes, we will provide worldwide shipping. Most perks will include free shipping within the continental U.S., some lower tier perks will require a shipping charge. Orders placed for shipping outside the U.S. will have an additional $20 charge — keep in mind, different countries have different customs policies and there is always a risk of delays or even confiscation when shipping abroad. In the case that a package is not delivered, please contact our support.</p></div>","We all know that essential oils smell great, but they are also powerful holistic tools to benefit everyday life.

Frequently Asked Questions Isn't CBD oil illegal in most states?There is a TON of misinformation pertaining to CBD oil, what it is, and it's legality. But the short answer is, no CBD is not illegal for distribution within the U.S., It is illegal for production and processing in several states in the U.S., this is due to its relationship with the marijuana plant itself (you can't legally grow marijuana in most U.S. states).CBD or Cannabidiol is found in many parts of the cannabis plant, but its legality is only affected by its sourcing stemming from the part of the plant it is extracted from (any oil extracted from marijuana leaves and stems are considered illegal in most non-participating states due to the potential cross-contamination with the illegal psychoactive oil, THC).In our case, we are using CBD derived from Hemp Seed Oil (small amounts of CBD is found in hemp seed oil) Hemp Seed oil does not contain THC, or any other illegal substance. Our Hemp Seed oil is sourced out of Canada, where it is perfectly legal to extract and export. Are Komega6 products organic?Technically speaking, yes, all of our products consist of raw organic oils that are produced from cold-pressed or steam distilled extraction processes. At this very moment, we have not paid for any official certificates stating that our products are organic, but we assure you that they are.Do you grow your own essential oils? Where do they come from?No, much like every other essential oil brand, we obtain our oils via distribution — all of our raw materials including our essential oils come with certificates of analysis proving their quality. We are committed to only using high-quality essential oils in our products and will make these certificates available via our website once obtained. The oils are sourced from farms from all over the globe and provided to us via a network of distribution partners accompanied with information that provides us with their region of origin. Are your oils for consumption?Although our oils may be safe to consume for most, we do not recommend consuming them as they are designed specifically for topical use.Can you use komega6 topical blends in a diffuser?Due to the inclusion of the carrier oils in our blends, we do not recommend distilling our topical blend oils. But you can if you really want to... Effects may vary.Wil I get a rash from applying the oils topically?All of our blends have been tested on multiple subjects to cut back on the risk of skin irritants. But in some cases, an individual may be particularly sensitive to an oil. If you have any known allergens to any of the oils listed on the label, we suggest not applying and contacting us for a replacement or refund.What do I do if I have an allergic reaction to a topical blend?Please contact your doctor immediately for any medical related advice. What if I do not like a scent or have a bad experience with a blend?Please contact us directly through our website support email provided on komega6.com and ask us for either a replacement or a refund.Do you ship abroad?Yes, we will provide worldwide shipping. Most perks will include free shipping within the continental U.S., some lower tier perks will require a shipping charge. Orders placed for shipping outside the U.S. will have an additional $20 charge — keep in mind, different countries have different customs policies and there is always a risk of delays or even confiscation when shipping abroad. In the case that a package is not delivered, please contact our support.",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

It also replaces bulky inversion tables and their blood-induced head rush that causes extreme pressure, discomfort, and dizziness.</p><p>In fact it’s so light and portable that it fits into a small case that can easily fit into a carry on bag for travel and only weighs about 11 ounces.</p><p>Instead of using gravity to stretch your lumbar muscles and spine as does an inversion table, the Lumbar Lengthener uses a little bit of force in a similar way to decompression tables. Simply pull on the handle, let go, relax and enjoy the stretch in you lower back.</p><h3 style=""margin-bottom:12pt;line-height: normal;"">The Benefits of the Lumbar Lengthener:</h3><p style=""margin-bottom:12pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;font-family: MS Gothic;color: black;"">✔</span><b><span style='font-size:12pt;font-family:""Arial"",""sans-serif"";color:black;'> Extremely Portable</span></b><span style='font-size:12pt;font-family:""Arial"",""sans-serif"";color:black;'> - Unlike inversion tables, decompression benches, or having to drive to see a chiropractor, this goes anywhere you go. It only weighs about 11 ounces and fits in a small bag (not included).</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:12pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;font-family: MS Gothic;color: black;"">✔</span><b><span style='font-size:12pt;font-family:""Arial"",""sans-serif"";color:black;'> Easy to Store</span></b><span style='font-size:12pt;font-family:""Arial"",""sans-serif"";color:black;'> - Even stored in a case, the Lumbar Lengthener is only about 13"" long x 5 wide x 1"" thick so you can store it in a drawer. Other solutions often become part of your home’s decor.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:12pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;font-family: MS Gothic;color: black;"">✔</span><span style='font-size:12pt;font-family:""Arial"",""sans-serif"";color:black;'> <b>Relax While Using</b> - No applying constant pressure or hanging upside down making it impossible to relax.  Simply pull the handle and the locking pulley keeps the tension on the cord. Just lie there, relax, and enjoy the stretch.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom:12pt;line-height:normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;font-family: MS Gothic;color: black;"">✔</span><span style='font-size:12pt;font-family:""Arial"",""sans-serif"";color:black;'> <b>Low Cost</b> - Chiropractor visits cost $30 to $200 a session with a series of treatments costing $450 to $6000.

It also replaces bulky inversion tables and their blood-induced head rush that causes extreme pressure, discomfort, and dizziness.In fact it’s so light and portable that it fits into a small case that can easily fit into a carry on bag for travel and only weighs about 11 ounces.Instead of using gravity to stretch your lumbar muscles and spine as does an inversion table, the Lumbar Lengthener uses a little bit of force in a similar way to decompression tables. Simply pull on the handle, let go, relax and enjoy the stretch in you lower back.The Benefits of the Lumbar Lengthener:✔ Extremely Portable - Unlike inversion tables, decompression benches, or having to drive to see a chiropractor, this goes anywhere you go. It only weighs about 11 ounces and fits in a small bag (not included).✔ Easy to Store - Even stored in a case, the Lumbar Lengthener is only about 13"" long x 5 wide x 1"" thick so you can store it in a drawer. Other solutions often become part of your home’s decor.✔ Relax While Using - No applying constant pressure or hanging upside down making it impossible to relax.  Simply pull the handle and the locking pulley keeps the tension on the cord. Just lie there, relax, and enjoy the stretch.✔ Low Cost - Chiropractor visits cost $30 to $200 a session with a series of treatments costing $450 to $6000. For about the same cost as one low end session, you can use this solution anytime, anywhere, as often as you like.✔   Built in Safety - You’re protected from applying excessive force on your spine since your upper body isn’t tied down. Gravity holds your upper body in place, but if you try to apply too much force it will slide. This protects your spine from injury while still providing just the right amount of stretch.✔ Benefits of Stretching - Helps relieve lumbar pain by reducing nerve pressure, re-hydrating discs, realigning the spine, relaxing tense muscles, decreasing inflammation, and increasing blood circulation.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We tell our story on our website, <a href=""http://www.pawspantry.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.pawspantry.net</a>.</p>
<p>We found LuLu as a rescue dog to serve as a companion for me when my husband was dealing with what was diagnosed as terminal cancer.</p>
<p>By God's grace, he has survived multiple treatments, and LuLu is now an incredible part of our family. </p>
<p>While taking care of LuLu, I was disappointed in the treats available - too many chemicals, too expensive, and too many fillers. This led to an intensive search for great recipes and ingredients, and a great deal of tinkering.</p>
<p>I love to bake, and decided to ensure LuLu got the very best foods and treats. I make her food from fresh and healthy ingredients, and also all her treats. That effort led to a group of treats that LuLu has tested and approved, and she is addicted to a steady supply.</p>
<p>Many of my friends and friends of LuLu asked for some of the treats I was making, and I was glad to provide them. However, we discovered that all such treats have to go through a rigorous process of analysis, certification and registration. </p>
<p>We started the process, and now we are at the last stage of launching our business!</p>
<p>Because it is expensive to get this done, we decided to use this crowdfunding opportunity to get to the next phase. Rather than simply ask for money, we are providing a true value to all of our supporters that includes a sample selection of our initial six products, as well as some great gifts.</p>
<p>Whether you have a furbaby you want to pamper or want a great gift to give a friend or your local shelter, this is your opportunity to support Paws Pantry and get a handsome reward for that support. </p>
<p>We will be supporting rescue groups and shelters with our profits, and we will also be working with the Job Creation Institute to help empower other women to pursue their dreams.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal for this effort is $25,000. That will allow us to complete all the legal and regulatory processes, finalize the packaging and inventory, and to produce our initial products, including your rewards.</p>
<p>We will gauge our costs to the level of support, but the full funding will get us fully operating and selling online. Regardless of the final level of support from this campaign, we will complete the regulatory requirements and get the first products out within 60 days of closing this project.</p>
<p>We have three levels of participation, explained in more detail here on this page:</p>
<ul>
<li>$25 - you get six two-ounce packets of our treats, plus some special Paws Pantry swag, and a one-year discount for all our products.</li>
<li>$50 - you get six four-ounce packets of our treats, plus some special Paws Pantry swag, and a two-year discount for all our products.</li>
<li>$100 - we'll send you six eight-ounce packets of our treats, plus some special Paws Pantry swag, and a lifetime discount for all our products. You will also be listed on the Paws Pantry Hall of Fame page on our website unless you prefer otherwise.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are following through with this idea for multiple reasons.</p>
<p>First, I am excited about having my own business helping others to provide healthy treats to their dogs. We love our furbabies, and this is a great way to ensure they stay around as long as possible.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have gained a new appreciation for how many other women would like to follow their own dream, but like me are intimidated by the processes involved.</p>
<p>My adviser, Margie, shares this desire and has made it possible for me to get to this point. Her advice and assistance has been invaluable, and she is looking forward to working with and empowering other women. We'll be providing more information on that in our updates.</p>
<p>We are also very excited by the response from shelters and rescue groups. We will work closely with local groups and shelters and provide low-cost treats to help with their work and to use as fundraisers. </p>
<p>We have other ideas, such as creating a DIY treat-baking option, and for helping families to use our treats for learning about business and the free enterprise system. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While we are counting on completing the full funding, we are committed to moving forward, and we will ensure that all of our initial supporters receive the products promised at their level of support.</p>
<p>We have thoroughly researched the requirements for final certification, and we are confident we will qualify. We are also pleased that while this process has been cumbersome, it creates what Margie calls a ""Barrier to Entry"" and helps make our treats even more marketable and unique.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We hope you will participate at one of the three levels, but you can help regardless:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please let all your friends and social media contacts know about our campaign. The Indiegogo share tools make this really easy.</li>
<li>Think about supporting even if you don't have a dog, and use the rewards as gifts and for your local shelter.</li>

<h1>What Does Insulin Angel Do?</h1>
<div><br/></div>
<h4>+ It Gives You Peace of Mind: Temperature Tracking</h4>
<span>Insulin Angel measures your medication’s temperature and warns you before dangerous levels are reached via the dedicated smartphone app.</span><br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291558/files/20150313012613-screens.jpg?1426235173"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>+ It Looks Out for You: Monitoring Stored Medication</h4>
<p><span>A recent study showed that 29% of domestic fridges regularly operate at temperatures of 9°C and above, which is higher than the recommended upper limit for most stored temperature sensitive medication. </span></p>Insulin Angel operates wirelessly inside the fridge and connects to your smartphone. In the event of a power outage, or other fridge failure, Insulin Angel tracks and records the storage condition of your stored and reserve medication.<br/><ul> </ul>
<ul></ul> </div><div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291585/files/20150313015404-fridge.jpg?1426236844"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
</div><div>
<span><h4><br/></h4>
<strong>
</strong><h4>+ It Helps You to Remember:  Proximity Tracking</h4></span><h4>
</h4>
<p>Insulin Angel alerts you only when you forget or lose your medication. Its context algorithms recognise if you are around home or work and when you are elsewhere. This avoids false notifications, for example when you are in the garden and your medication is somewhere indoors.</p>
<div><span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1289417/files/20150312061906-IMG_5704__1_.jpg?1426166346"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></span></div>
<div><span><h4><b><br/></b></h4>
<h4><b>+ It Keeps You Informed: Notification of Parents and Carers</b></h4>
<span>We ourselves are parents of children with Type 1 diabetes and we know how stressful it is to live with a chronic condition. Insulin Angel can simultaneously push alerts to a parent or carer as well as the user, to ensure that important messages are acted upon fast.</span><br/></span></div>
<div><span><span><p></p>

<div><span><span><h4><br/></h4>
<h4>+ It Knows What Is Best: Built-in Medication Database</h4>
<span><span>The most used insulins in the UK, USA and Germany are in the app's database. The database contains manufacturers' temperature recommendations, both for in-use medication and stored medications as well asseveral temperature sensitive blood glucose monitors from Accu-Chek and Bayer.</span></span></span></span></div>
<div>
<span><span><span><span>In addition, we store data for the</span></span></span></span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> rheumatism medication Humira and the asthma medication Salbutamol. The database continues to evolve and expand, and we are keen to hear from you what additions you would like to see.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span><span><span><span>
<p><span></span></p>
<h4>+ It Plans Ahead: Weather Warnings</h4></span><p></p>
<p><span>The Insulin Angel app gathers weather data about your current location and warns you about upcoming heat-waves or cold spells so you can take extra care.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>

<p>The ability of Insulin Angel to monitor the temperature of medicines is especially important in regions with extreme climates lacking access to refrigeration.</p>
<p>With this in mind we have partnered with Access Afya, a social enterprise creating a network of high-tech health centresin Kenya providing consultations, information, on-site diagnostics, and authentic medication.</p>

<p>We value quality, so we chose injection-molded ABS plastic and high quality electronics from Nordic Semiconductors. The battery is a readily available CR 2032 coin cell. </p>
<p>The digital temperature sensor is accurate to +/- 0.5 ºC and the internal memory can save up to three months of sensor data, which can be retrieved on the app and exported in csv or xml formats.

<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>We are a team of diabetics and parents of diabetic children who know that living with a medical condition such as diabetes is challenging. There is a lot to think about, with very serious consequences now and in the long term. It’s complicated and worrying. We could not find a solution to our problems so we decided to make one ourselves!</p>

<h2>Reducing Wastage, Reducing Costs</h2>
<div>
<p>Many medications come with recommended storage temperatures. Medication can be thrown away both because expiry dates are reached and because storage conditions are in doubt.  When in doubt most people throw away expensive medication.</p>
<p>One study of the
economic impact caused by discarded insulin concluded that insulin wastage averaged as high as 34.1% in
hospitals in Ontario, Canada. This is a cost of $8,000 for the largest
hospital surveyed and translated to an estimated cost of $360,000 a year for this region alone. We know from personal experience that <b><i>doubt
leads to waste</i></b>.</p>

<br/><p>With Insulin Angel we can
confirm whether medication has been safely stored.<span>  We hope that by removing doubt, w can document this wastage and find ways to reduce it.</span></p>

<h2>The Insulin Angel Story</h2>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Each founder is either
a diabetic or father of a diabetic. We have personally experienced times when
we didn’t really know the temperature guidelines for our medication; we
certainly didn’t know if temperature limits were breached. </p>
<p>We decided to solve these problems by making a high quality temperature and proximity sensor, realising that most sensors weren’t good enough and none stored any medication data. We tried various sensors - the better ones, usually used in industrial installations, were big bulky and expensive. None of the lower cost ones were reliable enough to trust with our vital medication. And it certainly wasn’t possible to connect the devices to a simple app that would run on everyday smartphones.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1301580/files/20150317035932-IMG_5778low_res.jpg?1426589972"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So, knowing about sensors and mobile technology we
decided to fix it, making an inexpensive, light-weight, accurate, reliable
solution. We made ease-of-use a must from the beginning; the device had to
connect wirelessly to any modern phone (iPhone 4S +, or Android 4.3+). And once
the medication is confirmed the App needed to know what the safe temperatures
for your medication.<span>  And that’s what we built.</span></p>
<p>We went the extra mile
and organised user testing with our local diabetes communities (which was how
the team met), sharing the idea or a test device with people suffering from
diabetes, rheumatism and asthma, and with medics themselves.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>What is diabetes?</h2>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Diabetes is a common but serious health condition. The disease takes various forms which all result in sufferers being unable to properly metabolize carbohydrates. There is no known cure for diabetes today, so many sufferers (especially Type 1) rely on insulin injections using ""pens"" or pumps.  </p>
<p>Modern Medicine made it possible for people with diabetes to live a normal life if they pay strict attention to measuring blood sugar levels and taking the right doses of insulin at the correct time. It is a stressful condition, and it makes something as simple as eating an apple into a complex exercise of testing, carbohydrate counting and injecting.</p>
<p><b>Some diabetes facts:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In the USA around 29 million (more than 9% of the population) have diabetes.</li>
<li>In the UK over 3 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes. Of these about 10% permanently and critically require insulin.</li>
<li>Of children with diabetes, 96% have ""Type 1"" requiring multiple insulin injections on a daily basis.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1289381/files/20150312055536-Atlas-poster-2014_EN-1.jpg?1426164936"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The annual cost of diabetes to the USA is estimated at $245 billion. Those with ""Type 1"" diabetes and some with ""Type 2"" need to ensure their medication is carefully looked after and never forgotten.</p>
<p>As insulin needs to be used and stored within specific temperature ranges, uncertainty over storage conditions can result in medicine being unnecessarily thrown away. </p>

Introducing Insulin Angel




A team of experienced mobile health innovators got together to create Insulin Angel. The people who created Insulin Angel are diabetics or parents to diabetic children which makes this product also come straight from the heart. The app notifies you before your insulin reaches a dangerous temperature and, crucially, if you forget and leave it behind. It makes diabetes easier to live with.  ""This will be such a breakthrough. Reducing the anxiety of living with medical conditions is just as important for me in my job as the condition itself."" -Dr. Philip Unwin of The Hart Surgery
As many as 380 million people around the world suffer from diabetes, and for those dependent on insulin their daily regime of injections and blood tests can present a huge challenge.Insulin Angel works with any medication that's temperature sensitive, or even if you simply want to make sure you don't forget your equipment - everything from asthma pumps to EpiPens to insulin.
What Does Insulin Angel Do?

+ It Gives You Peace of Mind: Temperature Tracking
Insulin Angel measures your medication’s temperature and warns you before dangerous levels are reached via the dedicated smartphone app.



+ It Looks Out for You: Monitoring Stored Medication
A recent study showed that 29% of domestic fridges regularly operate at temperatures of 9°C and above, which is higher than the recommended upper limit for most stored temperature sensitive medication. Insulin Angel operates wirelessly inside the fridge and connects to your smartphone. In the event of a power outage, or other fridge failure, Insulin Angel tracks and records the storage condition of your stored and reserve medication. 
 




+ It Helps You to Remember:  Proximity Tracking

Insulin Angel alerts you only when you forget or lose your medication. Its context algorithms recognise if you are around home or work and when you are elsewhere. This avoids false notifications, for example when you are in the garden and your medication is somewhere indoors.


+ It Keeps You Informed: Notification of Parents and Carers
We ourselves are parents of children with Type 1 diabetes and we know how stressful it is to live with a chronic condition. Insulin Angel can simultaneously push alerts to a parent or carer as well as the user, to ensure that important messages are acted upon fast.





+ It Knows What Is Best: Built-in Medication Database
The most used insulins in the UK, USA and Germany are in the app's database. The database contains manufacturers' temperature recommendations, both for in-use medication and stored medications as well asseveral temperature sensitive blood glucose monitors from Accu-Chek and Bayer.

In addition, we store data for the rheumatism medication Humira and the asthma medication Salbutamol. The database continues to evolve and expand, and we are keen to hear from you what additions you would like to see.




+ It Plans Ahead: Weather Warnings
The Insulin Angel app gathers weather data about your current location and warns you about upcoming heat-waves or cold spells so you can take extra care.



Donate an Insulin Angel Device
The ability of Insulin Angel to monitor the temperature of medicines is especially important in regions with extreme climates lacking access to refrigeration.
With this in mind we have partnered with Access Afya, a social enterprise creating a network of high-tech health centresin Kenya providing consultations, information, on-site diagnostics, and authentic medication.
All of our perks may be bought as donations to our charity partner Access Afya. simply purchase as normal and wait for us to get in touch.





The Insulin Angel Device

Four iterations of our design have led us to a small, light and portable product (5cm x 2.5cm / 2” x 1” inch). 



We value quality, so we chose injection-molded ABS plastic and high quality electronics from Nordic Semiconductors. The battery is a readily available CR 2032 coin cell. 
The digital temperature sensor is accurate to +/- 0.5 ºC and the internal memory can save up to three months of sensor data, which can be retrieved on the app and exported in csv or xml formats. Proximity sensing is also accurate, we have tested it up to 30 meters and even through two thick brick walls!


  











The Insulin Angel App



The Insulin Angel app will be available for free on both iOS and Android, and will be compatible with every modern smartphone that has Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity (iPhone 4S +, Android 4.3+). The apps runs in the background, communicates with the device at regular intervals and warns the user by a sound and vibration notification every time the medication approaches an unsafe temperature or if it becomes lost.

We are programming the apps with clever battery-saving algorithms so that the Bluetooth connection does not compromise your smartphone’s battery life.
When setting up each one of the new devices, you can choose your specific Insulin, or medication or test equipment from a list, and the app will automatically set up safe storage and in-use temperature settings.





The Roadmap




The Team
We are a team of diabetics and parents of diabetic children who know that living with a medical condition such as diabetes is challenging. There is a lot to think about, with very serious consequences now and in the long term. It’s complicated and worrying. We could not find a solution to our problems so we decided to make one ourselves!








Reducing Wastage, Reducing Costs

Many medications come with recommended storage temperatures. Medication can be thrown away both because expiry dates are reached and because storage conditions are in doubt.  When in doubt most people throw away expensive medication.
One study of the
economic impact caused by discarded insulin concluded that insulin wastage averaged as high as 34.1% in
hospitals in Ontario, Canada. This is a cost of $8,000 for the largest
hospital surveyed and translated to an estimated cost of $360,000 a year for this region alone. We know from personal experience that doubt
leads to waste.


With Insulin Angel we can
confirm whether medication has been safely stored.  We hope that by removing doubt, w can document this wastage and find ways to reduce it.





The Technology




Insulin Angel is built using relayr.io technology; a Berlin-based startup which provides easy tools to build connected products. The device communicates with smartphones using Bluetooth Low Energy. 


The hardware is based on the design reference of the WunderBar, relayr’s development platform. We chose relayr’s solution because it’s the best. They designed everything from the chip to the servers to work seamlessly together.
















The Insulin Angel Story



Each founder is either
a diabetic or father of a diabetic. We have personally experienced times when
we didn’t really know the temperature guidelines for our medication; we
certainly didn’t know if temperature limits were breached. 
We decided to solve these problems by making a high quality temperature and proximity sensor, realising that most sensors weren’t good enough and none stored any medication data. We tried various sensors - the better ones, usually used in industrial installations, were big bulky and expensive. None of the lower cost ones were reliable enough to trust with our vital medication.

</div>
<p></p>
<p>The natural approach to help you control and heal  pain. The patented  Q-Wave Pulse™ healing disc is based on the science of energy healing medicine. Our therapeutic  device releases electronic pulses in the form of of ultra low frequency waves that penetrate deep into tissue, cells, muscle and joints to relieve your pain.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1389208/files/20150416125741-sound-waves.jpg?1429214261"" src="""" style=""width: 450.618556701031px; height: 282px;""/></p>Sound Waves<div>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>These waves stimulate the area and increase the blood flow in order to revitalize and enable the body to heal more efficiently. That's why our healing disc is very unlike other healing devices which only
deliver a light electrical current to the skin and tissue to disrupt the pain
cycle temporarily.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1292324/files/20150313084359-qwave10.jpg?1426261439"" src="""" style=""width: 248.599px; height: 331px;""/></p>Pain<br/><br/>
<p>The
 Q-Wave Pulse™ healing disc 
can reduce pain, help heal tissue and cells in the human body, and accelerate healing by as much as 80%. The compact disc-shape electronic 
micro chip device with rechargeable lithium battery technology can be 
placed on or over the injured area to begin the healing process.  Current main stream treatments for chronic pain are drugs and heavy pain medications.  These drugs can help ease the pain but not the problem.  As a result your are left addicted along with numerous side effects.<br/></p>
<p>Can you imagine how much relief you can have at the touch of a button.  You or a loved one could be free of addictive and expensive pain medications.  Because the disc is self-contained you don't need pads, wiring, other attachments or mobile devices giving you complete freedom to you use it. This could totally change your life and how you deal with the pain.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Q-Wave Pulse™ healing disc delivers 4 pre-set
frequencies in a pulse rhythm vibration, that is set to 20 minute treatment
intervals but easier to use and doctor recommended. The frequency is set by you to promote
healing of the injured area. We have set out what each frequency can heal in
our instructional booklet.</p>

<b>""It doesn’t have to hurt to heal""</b> is our
 motto because it’s true. Often other medical devices and electronic 
healing products send such a high signal into the skin and tissue that 
they do more damage than good. People often feel extreme pain from 
severe injuries or nerve damage because the injured areas are very 
sensitive to electronic signals often causing a burning sensation. The Q-Wave Pulse™ healing disc utilizes 
ultra-low frequencies below 12Hz which are FDA cleared. These electronic signals do not cause pain or 
burning of the skin or injured area. Instead the frequencies penetrate tissue to speed up and promote healing while 
increasing blood flow to the injured area.<br/><br/>To use the Q-Wave Pulse™ all you have to do is press the on/off button and wait of for the device to turn on.  All the lights will turn on showing you all the frequencies available.  Next you press the on/off button again for few seconds and cycle through each frequency.  Once you found the frequency you would like to use let go of the button and start the healing process.   Next time you use the device it will remember the last setting.  It's that simple.<br/><br/><span><span></span></span>

<div><b>FAQ:</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>How does it work?</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The Q-Wave Pulse™ emits electronic pulses into your injured area.  You will feel a tingling sensation.  There are certain
areas of your body where it will take longer to feel any sensation.  This doesn’t mean the Q-Wave Pulse™
is not working.  It works but your body
tissue might be more damaged in places and you will not feel the tingling right
away. The frequency penetrates the injured area to speed
up, promote healing and increase blood flow.  It's important to allow the device to run through it's full 20 minute healing cycle.  Continuous treatments are recommended for the best results.  Over time the injury will get better and you will feel less pain.</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>How do I use it?</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The Q-Wave Pulse™ <span style=""background-color: initial;"">has one button that you can to turn on/off and select different frequencies for a 20 minute cycle.  This makes it very simple to use especially for people on the go. You can also use our several attachments for placing the Q-Wave Pulse™ on difficult areas like joints and back. </span>
</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Can I use the Q-Wave Pulse™ if I have implants?</b></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We recommend that people with pacemakers, </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">defibrillators or any type of implanted electronic devices do not use the </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Q-Wave Pulse™ without consulting your physician</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">.  </span><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The device can be used with any type of orthopedic metal implants. Again always consult your physician. </div>
<div><b>Your Satisfaction is Guaranteed!</b></div>
<div>If you are unhappy with the Q Wave Pulse ™ after 30 days send it back to us for a full refund you just pay the shipping and handling charges. </div>

<div><b>What if it doesn't work?</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>All units are pre-tested before they leave the manufacturer.  If you are not satisfied we will provide you with a money back guarantee.  </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Will the Q-Wave Pulse™ work on nerve pain type injuries?</b></div>

How the   Q-Wave Pulse™ Healing Disc Works


The natural approach to help you control and heal  pain. The patented  Q-Wave Pulse™ healing disc is based on the science of energy healing medicine. Our therapeutic  device releases electronic pulses in the form of of ultra low frequency waves that penetrate deep into tissue, cells, muscle and joints to relieve your pain.  


Sound Waves

These waves stimulate the area and increase the blood flow in order to revitalize and enable the body to heal more efficiently. That's why our healing disc is very unlike other healing devices which only
deliver a light electrical current to the skin and tissue to disrupt the pain
cycle temporarily.


Pain
The
 Q-Wave Pulse™ healing disc 
can reduce pain, help heal tissue and cells in the human body, and accelerate healing by as much as 80%. The compact disc-shape electronic 
micro chip device with rechargeable lithium battery technology can be 
placed on or over the injured area to begin the healing process.  Current main stream treatments for chronic pain are drugs and heavy pain medications.  These drugs can help ease the pain but not the problem.  As a result your are left addicted along with numerous side effects.
Can you imagine how much relief you can have at the touch of a button.  You or a loved one could be free of addictive and expensive pain medications.  Because the disc is self-contained you don't need pads, wiring, other attachments or mobile devices giving you complete freedom to you use it. This could totally change your life and how you deal with the pain.


The Q-Wave Pulse™ healing disc delivers 4 pre-set
frequencies in a pulse rhythm vibration, that is set to 20 minute treatment
intervals but easier to use and doctor recommended. The frequency is set by you to promote
healing of the injured area. We have set out what each frequency can heal in
our instructional booklet.

Our prototype with 4 Pre-set frequencies from 3Hz to 11Hz:Green - 11 Hertz
Red - 7.8 Hertz
Blue - 6.8 Hertz
Yellow -  3.3 Hertz


Q-Wave Pulse™ prototype and Garth, Inventor
""It doesn’t have to hurt to heal"" is our
 motto because it’s true. Often other medical devices and electronic 
healing products send such a high signal into the skin and tissue that 
they do more damage than good. People often feel extreme pain from 
severe injuries or nerve damage because the injured areas are very 
sensitive to electronic signals often causing a burning sensation. The Q-Wave Pulse™ healing disc utilizes 
ultra-low frequencies below 12Hz which are FDA cleared. These electronic signals do not cause pain or 
burning of the skin or injured area. Instead the frequencies penetrate tissue to speed up and promote healing while 
increasing blood flow to the injured area.To use the Q-Wave Pulse™ all you have to do is press the on/off button and wait of for the device to turn on.  All the lights will turn on showing you all the frequencies available.  Next you press the on/off button again for few seconds and cycle through each frequency.  Once you found the frequency you would like to use let go of the button and start the healing process.   Next time you use the device it will remember the last setting.  It's that simple.

FUNDING

Production and Fulfillment Plan

All our supporters are very important to us.  You will be the
ones responsible to bring this remarkable technology to people
suffering from pain.
Step 1 - Idea 
The idea has been put into
practice.  Bob Dickie and his professional team of designers and engineers
at Spark Innovations have built a prototype, the
tooling (mold ready for production) and guided us through the manufacturing
process.  We have been awarded a US Patent, International PCT  and
Trade Mark for the Q-Wave Pulse™ healing disc.  This has been a long and
expensive endeavour.








Draft designs of the Q-Wave Pulse™


Q-Wave Pulse™ the size of face watch (showing the underneath of the device)The Q-Wave Pulse™ healing disc allows for freedom and motion letting you place it anywhere on the body. In addition you can use our attachments:

a velcro breathable sport strap with a built in ring insert for the Q-Wave Pulse™

an adhesive throw away patch (patented) with a
     built in ring insert for the device that allows the user to attach it
     anywhere on the body
a reusable Patch (patented) with a built in
     ring insert for the device.  The difference is the rubberized surface that you wet and
     attach anywhere instead of throwing it away.


Step 2 - Pre-Manufacturing 

We are currently in the final
stages of design and pre-manufacturing.  What that means is the working
prototype has been made and the tooling for the device has been developed.  We are now ready to start full production.
We know that the Q-Wave Pulse™  can treat and heal pain. Your financial support of the Q-Wave Pulse™ healing disc will allow us to get our product out to you by end of 2015. 
Step 3 - Funding Why We Need Your SupportLet's change the way people heal - without
drugs.  You as a backer will now have an important role.  The funding
you provide us will get us through to the next stages of manufacturing and
distribution of the device.  We need to  tell everyone about   Q-Wave Pulse™,  what it can do and the endless possibilities.  

For us our crowdfunding campaign is an important way to send the message out and raise awareness.  Our product is so simple and portable that it provides a natural solution that not only helps relieve pain but also gives people back their lifestyle and freedom.   



Your support will help us reach the dream of helping millions.  Everyone is important to this campaign.  We will provide updates on our web site which you can follow and be part of our future success. 

Spread the word on Facebook, Youtube, Garth's tweet (@Qwaveman), Joanne tweet (@qwavefemnerd).

FAQ:

How does it work?

The Q-Wave Pulse™ emits electronic pulses into your injured area.  You will feel a tingling sensation.  There are certain
areas of your body where it will take longer to feel any sensation.  This doesn’t mean the Q-Wave Pulse™
is not working.  It works but your body
tissue might be more damaged in places and you will not feel the tingling right
away. The frequency penetrates the injured area to speed
up, promote healing and increase blood flow.  It's important to allow the device to run through it's full 20 minute healing cycle.  Continuous treatments are recommended for the best results.  Over time the injury will get better and you will feel less pain.

How do I use it?

The Q-Wave Pulse™ has one button that you can to turn on/off and select different frequencies for a 20 minute cycle.  This makes it very simple to use especially for people on the go. You can also use our several attachments for placing the Q-Wave Pulse™ on difficult areas like joints and back. 


Can I use the Q-Wave Pulse™ if I have implants?


We recommend that people with pacemakers, defibrillators or any type of implanted electronic devices do not use the Q-Wave Pulse™ without consulting your physician.  


The device can be used with any type of orthopedic metal implants. Again always consult your physician. 
Your Satisfaction is Guaranteed!
If you are unhappy with the Q Wave Pulse ™ after 30 days send it back to us for a full refund you just pay the shipping and handling charges. 

What if it doesn't work?

All units are pre-tested before they leave the manufacturer.  If you are not satisfied we will provide you with a money back guarantee.  

Will the Q-Wave Pulse™ work on nerve pain type injuries?

Everyone is different when it comes to pain.  Not everyone feels pain the same way. The Q-Wave Pulse™ is a tool to help relieve your pain over time. Like our motto says ""it doesn't have to hurt to heal"".  Nerve pain is very sensitive to any any type of stimulation.  The Q-Wave Pulse™ provides a gentle way of controlling the pain.

<h1><b>Welcome to our Project!</b></h1>
<p><i>Introducing the Project</i></p>
<p>We are a team of three completely different people who wants to act along and launch something essential. The concept is to start a project that can benefit others and help society. </p>
<p>Our project is based on examinations and studies of dental care. ""Our true kickstart"" was that we recognized how some people these days cannot afford to smile anymore. Which leads us to one of our main ideas - anybody should be able to smile - and a broken smile can always be fixed. </p>
<p>Basically our goal is that everyone should be able to afford dental care quality products - not having to make own home experiments to get access. There are three products in our focus - custom craft teeth - teeth whitening - VitaMeal which has its focus on famine and starving populations.</p>
<p>As a team we have been able to initiate the project and attained some major steps already. Now we are getting ready for a countdown and finally being able to open up our doors. </p>
<p>We now inquire you to assist and follow our progress and birth into something that we hope you also see a meaning in. We need this last lift in order to become real. Thank you for your indulgence!</p>
<h1><b>Main Issue and Main Goal -</b></h1>
<p>The main issue that we are attempting to undertake is the high costs of dental care. Whereas our main goal is to limit the costs while maintaining and preserving a high standard and quality. </p>
<p>All over the world the necessity of having a well working hygiene and dental care have increased by a high amount of people. In contrast dentists and others have realized this need - taken this into their advantage. Consequently it can be stated that their is a notable change in price due to this. </p>
<p>Of course, people who are helping others with dental care should be paid for the products - but it should not be a gold mine on peoples needs.</p>
<h1><b>Investigation -</b></h1>
<p>Many people, including a member of our team have had the unfortunate to struggle with a broken tooth. Luckily him - the insurance covered it. Yet, when the insurance is not there to cover - it is a big problem.</p>
<p>We welcome your freedom of investigating this area by yourself. However, what we have found in our explorations are that the last past years, a number between 20 - 30% of people in Europe tends not to go to the dentist appointments due to high costs. Its not that they don't want to - they can't.  </p>
<p>Most people who cannot afford e.g insurance including, 20 - 30 % of people in Europe only shows up to the dentist or doctor when it is considered <b>urgent</b>. </p>
<p>Now if we choose to look at why some people choose not to go regularly to the dentist - we could easily agree on stupidity or dentist fear. However, we have the knowledge that the true factor prohibiting this are high costs. Who could blame them? Not being able to spend money on a new tooth, these people rather tend to blame high tax and low income to be the actual reason. </p>
<p>As people start to demand more dental healthcare such as, repairing a tooth or a set of teeth or whitening - we could easily confirm that the demand has a correlation to the increasing of prices. </p>
<p>Luckily for us, we do not have to go through the piles of laws and decrease tax and increase salary in order for people to afford dental care. This solution is more simple and none complex - we just want to eliminate the costs.</p>
<p>An more frequent action people choose to do nowadays - are to make their own products since they cannot afford the real. If we use this example to give you a hint - we would like you to recall of what that happened when people were prohibited the usage of alcohol. Well people made it themselves, which resulted in the massacre at Valentine's Day, Chicago. Now hopefully this will not go as far.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, the true meaning is that making own products could be dangerous - Its inspiring to see that more people use creativity to craft their own products. However, are they doing it because the joy or cause they have to? </p>
<p>Now if you are on of these product makers please bear in mind that some are abrasive and should not be used more than recommended - such as our whitening toothpaste. </p>
<h1><b>Product Idea and Goal</b></h1>
<div>As stated earlier on our presentation - we are focusing on three products - and we have goals for each of them as we expand.</div>
<p><b>Tooth / Teeth Repairing</b></p>
<p>Our scientist and craftsman have the education and skill in the ceramics of crafting teeth. Now one obstacle when lowering the price is that usually the quality lowers too.  We know that the high costs of the appointments are not due to the costs of making the product but for profit. Sure if you would like a golden tooth that might not be true.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<p><i>These are made in the lab that we have access to. As well, yes we do have legal rights to create teeth for customers. The pictures are all including in our PDF - that we gladly share to anyone who wish - as well there are completed registration papers etc.</i></p>
<p><b>The main goal of our Teeth products</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Cut down the costs by 50% - this means that we take craft, shipping, procedure in consideration as well maintaining quality.</li>
<li>Increasing our Technology in our dental research to give more long lasting products and higher quality available.</li>
<li>Our project is not country based which means that we are not only going to focus only on one country e.g Sweden, we are focusing globally.</li>
</ul>
<div>Example: if the cost is 750 EU for repairing a tooth we aim to lower it to 325 EU - where the goal is to accomplish the exact same quality.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h1>Tooth Whitening </h1>
<div><br/></div>
<p>We are always in the mode of establishing new colleagues and partners, taking possible expansions by huge importance. One product that we happily recommend people using - is one of our Sponsors dental care products. We are willing to keep on recommending these products to our customers. </p>
<p><b>What make these products special?</b></p>
<p>Firstly, the prices does matter.  Everyone can afford these products and everyone should be able to get a white smile if that is what they want to.  </p>
<p>Secondly, these products show results, which everyone says. However, to prove it we are willing to give out free samples for customers to try so that they can see results before buying it. </p>
<p>Lastly, thanks to a good price, free samples, results - people now don't have to go and buy these expensive whitening kits or undergo ripoff procedures. Now if you already chosen an expensive way - we also have an anti-plague so that you can keep those results.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Whitening Fluoride Toothpaste"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/378/694/acccaede9a73f6ab9b8dcf0a88e8f098_original.jpg?v=1440540937&amp;w=456&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=bf25a8ad6ba8e8eabaa8025d785328f4"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Whitening Fluoride Toothpaste</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<p><b>The main goal of our Whitening products:</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain a low cost so that all people can afford whitening instead of crafting various products at home or buying expensive kits.</li>
<li>Offer our customers, free samples of our recommendations. Giving them a chance of trying the results.</li>
<li>Helping people who have been through expensive procedures - to change - and keep their results without having to go to the next annual procedure.</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h1>VitaMeal - Charity</h1></div><div><br/></div>
<div>As we said in our introduction we want to contribute to society. Booth by lowering the expense to peoples demand on dental healthcare but in addition we also want to help others that needs our help. Famine is a problem that cannot be tackled alone, therefor we chosen to support VitaMeal since it proves results.</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440617674/wje4dqq1pxxqhwo5qcxa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div><b>Why VitaMeal?</b></div>
<div>VitaMeal is probably the only true charity product that we know shows best progression. Every<span style=""background-color: initial;"">time that we send a donation we fed one child for a whole month in Malawi. </span>
</div>
<div>Our goal with VitaMeal is to open peoples eyes. Each customer will receive information about VitaMeal and an opportunity to spread it to others - and as thanks our goal is to provide free samplings to whoever supports the war against famine.  We hope to be able to be proud sponsors in the fight against famine.</div><div><br/></div><div><b><h1>Risks and Challenges </h1></b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>
<p>One of our problem that we definitively are going to encounter during our expansion are the time of making teeth to our customers. The way we have thought of this is - if the project expands so do we have to do. Easily, by investing in new team members to help us craft and deliver quality.</p>
<p>Another possible threat is that more people dentists start to lower costs but that was our main goal so we do not plan on tackling them, rather we would like them to become partners, expanding our main idea further.</p>
<p>Partnerships - some dentists might be totally against our fruitful idea trying to put obstacles by not willing to help with the procedure. We are going to focus on the ones who are willing to contribute first - making sure that they get their business going. The idea of that more people can afford their dental services more people as well dentist will be aware of this.</p>
</div><div><br/></div>
<h1>Conclusion</h1><div><br/></div>
<div>Yes, everyone should be able to afford our products. No matter what product that is in interest. People should be able to white or repair their teeth not having to stall it out due to high costs. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">In some years we will have to expand and more people around the globe will be able to get a quality dental healthcare without spending a fortune.</span>
</div>
<p>The main idea is to benefit peoples dental care - not only in Sweden but globally.

</div>","Welcome to our Project!
Introducing the Project
We are a team of three completely different people who wants to act along and launch something essential. The concept is to start a project that can benefit others and help society. 
Our project is based on examinations and studies of dental care. ""Our true kickstart"" was that we recognized how some people these days cannot afford to smile anymore. Which leads us to one of our main ideas - anybody should be able to smile - and a broken smile can always be fixed. 
Basically our goal is that everyone should be able to afford dental care quality products - not having to make own home experiments to get access. There are three products in our focus - custom craft teeth - teeth whitening - VitaMeal which has its focus on famine and starving populations.
As a team we have been able to initiate the project and attained some major steps already. Now we are getting ready for a countdown and finally being able to open up our doors. 
We now inquire you to assist and follow our progress and birth into something that we hope you also see a meaning in. We need this last lift in order to become real. Thank you for your indulgence!
Main Issue and Main Goal -
The main issue that we are attempting to undertake is the high costs of dental care. Whereas our main goal is to limit the costs while maintaining and preserving a high standard and quality. 
All over the world the necessity of having a well working hygiene and dental care have increased by a high amount of people. In contrast dentists and others have realized this need - taken this into their advantage. Consequently it can be stated that their is a notable change in price due to this. 
Of course, people who are helping others with dental care should be paid for the products - but it should not be a gold mine on peoples needs.
Investigation -
Many people, including a member of our team have had the unfortunate to struggle with a broken tooth. Luckily him - the insurance covered it. Yet, when the insurance is not there to cover - it is a big problem.
We welcome your freedom of investigating this area by yourself. However, what we have found in our explorations are that the last past years, a number between 20 - 30% of people in Europe tends not to go to the dentist appointments due to high costs. Its not that they don't want to - they can't.  
Most people who cannot afford e.g insurance including, 20 - 30 % of people in Europe only shows up to the dentist or doctor when it is considered urgent. 
Now if we choose to look at why some people choose not to go regularly to the dentist - we could easily agree on stupidity or dentist fear. However, we have the knowledge that the true factor prohibiting this are high costs. Who could blame them? Not being able to spend money on a new tooth, these people rather tend to blame high tax and low income to be the actual reason. 
As people start to demand more dental healthcare such as, repairing a tooth or a set of teeth or whitening - we could easily confirm that the demand has a correlation to the increasing of prices. 
Luckily for us, we do not have to go through the piles of laws and decrease tax and increase salary in order for people to afford dental care. This solution is more simple and none complex - we just want to eliminate the costs.
An more frequent action people choose to do nowadays - are to make their own products since they cannot afford the real. If we use this example to give you a hint - we would like you to recall of what that happened when people were prohibited the usage of alcohol. Well people made it themselves, which resulted in the massacre at Valentine's Day, Chicago. Now hopefully this will not go as far.
Jokes aside, the true meaning is that making own products could be dangerous - Its inspiring to see that more people use creativity to craft their own products. However, are they doing it because the joy or cause they have to? 
Now if you are on of these product makers please bear in mind that some are abrasive and should not be used more than recommended - such as our whitening toothpaste. 
Product Idea and Goal
As stated earlier on our presentation - we are focusing on three products - and we have goals for each of them as we expand.
Tooth / Teeth Repairing
Our scientist and craftsman have the education and skill in the ceramics of crafting teeth. Now one obstacle when lowering the price is that usually the quality lowers too.  We know that the high costs of the appointments are not due to the costs of making the product but for profit. Sure if you would like a golden tooth that might not be true. 
Here are some of our handmade quality products.

 Product Sample 1

 Product Sample 2

 Product Sample 3

 Product Sample 4
These are made in the lab that we have access to. As well, yes we do have legal rights to create teeth for customers. The pictures are all including in our PDF - that we gladly share to anyone who wish - as well there are completed registration papers etc.
The main goal of our Teeth products

Cut down the costs by 50% - this means that we take craft, shipping, procedure in consideration as well maintaining quality.
Increasing our Technology in our dental research to give more long lasting products and higher quality available.
Our project is not country based which means that we are not only going to focus only on one country e.g Sweden, we are focusing globally.

Example: if the cost is 750 EU for repairing a tooth we aim to lower it to 325 EU - where the goal is to accomplish the exact same quality.

Tooth Whitening 

We are always in the mode of establishing new colleagues and partners, taking possible expansions by huge importance. One product that we happily recommend people using - is one of our Sponsors dental care products. We are willing to keep on recommending these products to our customers. 
What make these products special?
Firstly, the prices does matter.  Everyone can afford these products and everyone should be able to get a white smile if that is what they want to.  
Secondly, these products show results, which everyone says. However, to prove it we are willing to give out free samples for customers to try so that they can see results before buying it. 
Lastly, thanks to a good price, free samples, results - people now don't have to go and buy these expensive whitening kits or undergo ripoff procedures. Now if you already chosen an expensive way - we also have an anti-plague so that you can keep those results.

Whitening Fluoride Toothpaste
The main goal of our Whitening products: 

Maintain a low cost so that all people can afford whitening instead of crafting various products at home or buying expensive kits.
Offer our customers, free samples of our recommendations. Giving them a chance of trying the results.
Helping people who have been through expensive procedures - to change - and keep their results without having to go to the next annual procedure.


VitaMeal - Charity
As we said in our introduction we want to contribute to society. Booth by lowering the expense to peoples demand on dental healthcare but in addition we also want to help others that needs our help. Famine is a problem that cannot be tackled alone, therefor we chosen to support VitaMeal since it proves results.



Why VitaMeal?
VitaMeal is probably the only true charity product that we know shows best progression. Everytime that we send a donation we fed one child for a whole month in Malawi. 

Our goal with VitaMeal is to open peoples eyes. Each customer will receive information about VitaMeal and an opportunity to spread it to others - and as thanks our goal is to provide free samplings to whoever supports the war against famine.  We hope to be able to be proud sponsors in the fight against famine.Risks and Challenges 
One of our problem that we definitively are going to encounter during our expansion are the time of making teeth to our customers. The way we have thought of this is - if the project expands so do we have to do. Easily, by investing in new team members to help us craft and deliver quality.
Another possible threat is that more people dentists start to lower costs but that was our main goal so we do not plan on tackling them, rather we would like them to become partners, expanding our main idea further.
Partnerships - some dentists might be totally against our fruitful idea trying to put obstacles by not willing to help with the procedure. We are going to focus on the ones who are willing to contribute first - making sure that they get their business going. The idea of that more people can afford their dental services more people as well dentist will be aware of this.

Conclusion
Yes, everyone should be able to afford our products. No matter what product that is in interest. People should be able to white or repair their teeth not having to stall it out due to high costs. In some years we will have to expand and more people around the globe will be able to get a quality dental healthcare without spending a fortune.

The main idea is to benefit peoples dental care - not only in Sweden but globally. We have already gotten huge support from many people as well companies. Nowadays the whole team is working on the project - adjusting - progressing - as well our real time jobs - fighting to make this real. We are so close to start this and become a whole part of it. We just need the last kick to get us a boost and start. 
If you think - believe and hope for our dream to come true or want to take a part of our dream. Everything counts, small or big, penny or gold. Each step makes us comfortable to say that we are convenient to presume that we are on the threshold to this dream coming true.
We sincerely hope you liked our presentation and if you would want to become a part of us your gladly appreciated to contact us! As well, if there are any questions just let us know!

</div></div>","We love light-sabers. We’ve loved them from the first glorious swing to the electric clash of that final strike - we can't deny the joyous excitement coursing through our veins. With over 10 years of saber experience under our belts, we still hadn’t found a saber to live up to our expectations. So we made our own, better than the rest, with features designed to address the shortcomings of other sabers. Now we’re ready to share our creation with saber enthusiasts everywhere to give “Epic Battle” a whole new meaning. 








 

Custom units with multiple colors, sounds, and motion effects will cost you over $800 and you still have to fumble with clunky buttons, tiny retention screws, and frustrating chargers. The Valence Saber™ is cut from a different mold. Not only is it a fraction of the cost but it is loaded with more features than any existing saber.

Patent-Pending, Bluetooth-controlled, instant color and sound change, a battle-ready handle free from buttons or switches, USB charging for your saber, and tool-less blade retention. No other saber on the planet packs as much as the Valence Saber. Make your pledge now and stand together for endless fun!






Base Hilt







The Valence Saber communicates via Bluetooth LE with your 
Android™* smartphone for instant color and sound change. Control up to 7
 sabers at the same time on one device. The free Valence Saber App 
allows you to preview color and sound on your phone before you make the 
changes to your saber. You can even turn off individual sound effects 
and adjust the volume. Best of all you can effortlessly turn your saber 
on and off with one press. 
*Android is a trademark of Google Inc.

What if I don't have/want to use my phone?Good
 news! The Valence Saber's suite of effects are also available directly 
on the saber. Highly specific motions allow color and sound change; 
these motions are designed to be purposeful and time sensitive so your 
saber has the best chance of keeping the setting you want. And the saber
 already turns on and off without the phone, so no worries there.





Blades
Each saber's blade is 1.25"" outside diameter, approximately 33.5"" in length. The wall is 1/16"" wide, allowing the blade to be durable yet light enough for extensive dueling. The LED strips are housed in the blade, which is removable, along with the diffusing foam and 3M diffuser film. Tested by slamming into concrete. Results: no discernible damage, no broken LEDs. These blades can take punishment. See OUR PROMISE section for warranty.

Valence Sheath™
The Valence Sheath is a revolutionary feature that completely 
changes the way you experience costume-ready, custom saber handles. Now 
with each Valence Saber you can quickly customize the entire cosmetic 
look and feel in seconds without the need to purchase additional sabers.


How it Works:

Back us now!: Pick your perk. When you back us for a Valence Saber you get the VS Echelon™ sheath at no additional cost! That's right, your first sheath is on us.
Super Simple Assembly: The sheath slides over the existing 
base handle and locks securely into place. A soft-tipped guide screw 
makes sure the speaker slots and USB slot line up and stay that way. 
Screw is permanently attached during manufacturing so no tools are 
required for the sheath, either. To remove simply pull firmly on the 
sheath and it slides off.
Customize: Need to make a quick costume switch? No problem.

between the light and dark and switches sabers based on his or her mood?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>While working in a heavy industries as engineer for over 20 years, I myself have suffered from backpain occasionally. Especially, since my home is located far from the company, driving a car was like hell when the backpain attacks. The main purposes of this campaign are to help slipped disk patients live and work more comfortably and promote widespread use of our waist crutch. What we would want from contributors is to donate 70 US dollars or more until the total amount reaches 7,000 dollars. In return we are planning to provide the product at the price of around 70 dollars each.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding we aim at is 7,000 dollars and will be used to expand our business  worldwide. We plan to initially manufacture 100 waist crutches and distribute them to the contributors at about 70 dollars each, half as much as the list price. We intend to return the money to the investors if the funds collected fall short of the target amount, $7,000.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The trends of global aging and increasing sedentary(sitting) working environments lead to a sharp increase in the number of slipped disk patients. Many of the patients, however, live an uncomfortable life after conservative treatment because the surgical approach is often ineffective. In Korea, the number of slipped disk patients reaches about 8% of the total population, or 4 million. Among them, more than 90% or 3.7 million people live after conservative treatment without surgery. The United States or other countries are assumed to have the same situation.</p>
<p>     Therefore, it is urgent to provide a working solution to those who suffer from back pain while sitting on a chair or floor at home or workplace, or while driving on a car seat for a long time. The proposer of this project himself experienced a lot of pain in his back while driving long hours, which eventually led to the development of this product. As a first step, five sets of the prototype were made and put to field test successfully. In the process of field test, we could ensure ourselves great demands of our back support device. Also, the volunteer users have encouraged and advised us to help other sufferers live in peace. For example, we received a thank-you letter from a fifteen-year-old girl  who had been able to study at a desk with the help of our waist chair. She used to suffer from the deformed spine caused by severe slipped disk for a long time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We expect that there may be a couple of roadblocks: First the design of the product could be improved in its completeness. This causes the product to be less marketable or of less commercial value. Second, it is quite possible that outstanding success in the market will touch off a surge of copycat products because the design of our product is rather simple. The  countermeasures are two-fold: Once sufficient funds are available, a team of design experts can be ready to keep improving the marketability and completeness of the product through quality upgrades. Furthermore, as of now, we have registered a domestic patent for our waist crutch, and filed an international patent application under the PCT. We will continue to file patent applications in more countries possible. We believe these two measures should be effective in maximizing the product quality and fighting against the would-be copycats.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>For those who can't participate in our campaign, they may visit our Web page (in Korean) or Youtube to see and evaluate our product for their needs. We hope the news of our waist crutch can reach all those with disk or back problems.</p>

Many times, an event must be avoided, and the individual misses out on an important occasion with family, friends or colleagues. Guaranteed seating would alleviate these challenges, among others, and open doors to public spaces for many individuals. What does Seated do?Seated alerts an individual that someone nearby requires priority seating, and allows that person to volunteer a seat. Mobile technology allows us to bypass assumptions and make requests clear and discreet, in real time. A mobile app, like Seated, puts control directly into the hands of an individual who needs help, and opens up a simple, direct line of communication with the immediate public who are willing and able to help.Seated guarantees seating in public spaces by connecting an individual with a volunteer willing to offer a seat, while lowering barriers to asking for help. How does Seated work?Install the app on your personal device.Select your role:
VIP - you need a seatOR
Volunteer - you are willing and able to give up your seat  The VIP activates Seated when in a public place where seating is limited. Seated searches for Volunteers nearby.The Volunteer receives an alert that a VIP is nearby and needs a seat. The Volunteer offers a seat to the VIP, or ignores the request.The VIP receives an alert that a Volunteer is offering a seat.The VIP  accepts or declines the offer.If the request is accepted by both parties, the Volunteer offers the seat to the designated VIP.  No further exchange of information is needed.*Note: An individual can easily switch between VIP or Volunteer roles. For example, after an injury, someone regularly willing and able to volunteer a seat (Volunteer role) may require seating (VIP role). After recovery, a VIP can switch back to being a Volunteer. Who benefits?
Injury
Illness (acute)
Illness (chronic)
Pregnancy
Adult accompanying a child that needs to be carried
Elderly
Low vision
Intellectual disability
Psychiatric disability
And more…
 Where can Seated be used?
Trains
Buses
Music/comedy/performance venues
Waiting rooms (i.e. pharmacy)
Public forums/meetings
Coffee shops
Bars
Any public place where seating is not guaranteed
 Why now?I’ve been thinking about this problem for a long time. And now we’re in an era where we use our mobile devices to connect with others for transportation, lodging, dating, commerce, and many other important functions. Seated extends this movement of collaboration and shared resources, and brings it to a community who can truly benefit in important ways from the awareness and generosity of others.Seated is a simple, low-cost solution that can serve a wide range of conditions and populations.When I ride the train, or attend a concert, I scan the crowd in hopes of finding a seat, allowing me to comfortably get to my destination, or to stay for the entire show. I believe that the people around me are good and would gladly assist me if they are able, but I don't have an easy way to access them without making assumptions and overtly exposing my own condition. Seated gives us a tool to help each other out, when we can. ContributeIf you believe there is a need for Seated, and would like to see it move forward, consider donating, and sharing this campaign. Your contribution to this campaign will go toward:PHASE I:
gauge interest 
create/test a prototype of the app
business development*
*I hope to keep Seated free for all users. This will be a main focus of business development in Phase I.With enough interest and a proof-of-concept in hand, funding will then be sought for:PHASE II:build and market a scalable app (the real thing!) Thank you for your support! Together we can make public spaces more accessible for everyone. To learn more, check out these resources:The Invisible Disabilities AssociationNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)Transport for London (TfL) Badge Program",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>For example, you want us to create an app for basketball.</p>
<p>We will immediately launch Kaki Basketball live on <strong>Google Play</strong> and <strong>App Store</strong>, and the app will allow you to find buddies with the <strong>same interest</strong> (living near you)!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Kaki Buddy</h3>
<p>Just to prove we can deliver, we have launched a prototype of what your app will be like on Google Play and App store called Kaki Buddy. (Kaki Buddy was <u><strong><a href=""http://www.straitstimes.com/tech/work-out-with-new-friends-via-these-apps"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mentioned</a></strong></u> in Singapore's #1 newspaper, <u><strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TheStraitsTimes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Straits Times</a></strong></u>) </p>
<p><i>Please note that this app is only a prototype of what your Kaki Sport app will be like, and once we are funded, we will release fully functional apps that are better, faster, smoother and much sleeker according to the sports/activities you have chosen.</i></p>
<p>Hard work isn't an issue for my team, and we will work day and night to create apps that are smooth, user-friendly and bug-free for our wonderful backers!</p>

<h3>The power of Kaki Apps</h3>
<p>Challenging other groups/teams really shines in activities that require larger teams or groups, since you can easily challenge another team to a match with 1 single swipe!</p>
<p>For example, instead of needing to find another 11 people to play a full soccer match (which can be alot of work, calling friends &amp; finding a common time for all), you just need to <strong>challenge another team</strong>, and let their leader deal with his team members!</p>
<p>This can also be useful for smaller groups; for example you and your spouse love badminton, but your friends aren't that passionate about it. Just use this app to find another couple nearby with the same interest and you're good to go!</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Q: Why Kaki Apps? Why not just use Meetup or join a Facebook group?</strong></p>
<p>A: After trying these (and many other) apps we have found them all troublesome &amp; tedious for a task that should be simple: find people with the same interest living near you. With Kaki, we combined 2 apps (Tinder + Whatsapp) which do exactly what they are supposed to do. Except instead of finding people for romantic reasons, you find people with the same activity interest as you. Also, Kaki allows group to group interaction (so your soccer team can challenge another soccer team easily). And with a much more personalized touch, your group will now consist of people who live a stone's throw away from you!</p>
<p><strong>Q: What if I want to find people who are beginners (or experts) at the sport?</strong></p>
<p>A: We have the option to select this in the app.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What will the app be called after it is published?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q: For the ""Create a Team"" Perk, will I be able to modify my group/team details after you create it for me?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, creating &amp; editing a team/group on Kaki App is amazingly simple! We just do it for you so that your team/group will look amazing and you will save the effort of finding a beautiful team image or writing a team description to attract others to join your team.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I, as a backer, own rights to the app with the activity I choose? For example, if i choose basketball and Kaki Basketball is launched, will I be the owner of the app?</strong></p>

There when you need it. You simply give your MedKaz — which contains ALL your records from ALL your current and past providers — to your doctor. Reduces risk. Saves you money. Ensures you receive quality care at home, away, in an emergency.Does what NONE of your doctors' portals can do. Assembles ALL your records from ALL your care providers in one place and contains DETAILED notes not merely summaries!Anyone can use it even if you have limited computer skills or are unable to afford a smartphone. Everyone benefits today, tomorrow. Doctors can coordinate/deliver better care. Patients receive better care; save money. Payers — employers, insurers and government — save money. Our economy is stronger. Paves the way for major changes in the way care is organized, delivered, and paid for. When You Need ItTravel   You get sick away from home.
You see a doctor but he or she knows nothing about your medical issues or history and can't access your records. If you're healthy, this may not be a problem.
If you have chronic illnesses, it is a big problem.
In either case, MedKaz solves it.
Emergency   Whether at home or away, you're rushed to an Emergency Department.
They, too, know nothing about you or your medical history. They may draw blood to learn something about the state of your health, and they treat you as best they can.
If you're unconscious, their problems treating you are compounded.
In either case, MedKaz solves the problem.
Routine Care   Your current doctors each have only their own records to guide them.
Unless they are all in the same network, they can't access all your records from all your other current and past providers.
Even if they have treated you for years, they often need to access your previous providers' records to gain insight into your current issues, but they may not be available. This frequently results in extra visits, your doctor ordering unnecessary tests and procedures, and may result in costly mistakes.
MedKaz solves the problem.
 How Your Doctors Use It What People SayMB, Vermont, patient   ""I have all my records for the last 35 years on my MedKaz. My doctors and I love it. I recently avoided two office visits and related procedures because the information my doctors needed was on my MedKaz. This saved Medicare almost $900. Not a bad return on a $99 investment."" (NB, it's only $59 during this campaign!)DL, New York, patient   ""I developed severe chest pains and was rushed by ambulance to a hospital Emergency Department. They saw I previously had open heart surgery and asked me what vessels were involved. I didn't know so they assigned a resident to get my records from the hospital where my surgery had been performed. They exchanged a lot of faxes including a HIPAA release for me to sign, and finally faxed my records to the resident. This process took an agonizing 45 minutes. I was afraid I'd die before they would treat me. If I had had a MedKaz, both the delay and stress I felt would have been avoided!""JB, Ohio, patient   For 20 years I suffered from an illness none of my doctors could identify.

care about is happening. For example, when grandma picks up the baby from daycare mom
gets a notification. We felt that telling mom every time the baby cries

<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Every parent has a story of a time they wish they knew what was
happening with their baby.  Our personal
experiences were part of what led us to develop BabyBit. Founder Brian recalls
a time when a babysitter planted his children in front of the TV and spent the
next four hours asleep in their guest bedroom. 
Co-founder Jonathan’s wife once came home to find a strange baby in their home.  It turned out that her nanny had
been leaving their infant unattended for 30 minutes each day so she could
pick-up another baby and care for them both in Jonathan’s home.  In both of these cases, a technology like
BabyBit would have notified the parent if the baby was crying for a long period
of time, and that the caregiver was not in proximity.  </p>
<p>Every year one million moms return to work within two weeks of
giving birth… With 9 children between us, the idea for BabyBit emerged when we
started to think about the stress new parents face, especially new mothers,
when they return to work – often much earlier than they would like.  We
asked ourselves, if we can't wave a wand and create more family friendly work practices,
what kind of technology could help create peace of mind for parents who have to
be away from their babies?</p>
<p>BabyBit is neither a higher tech baby monitor nor a medical
device.  It’s a tool that provides insightful, actionable information, to
both parent and caregiver so they can work together to keep baby safe and
happy. The app has additional in-depth information a parent may want.</p>

but what surprised us was that a million moms go back 
to work within two weeks of giving birth,"" Ostrovsky said.
 ""Instead of being focused on inundating the parents with
 data, we're giving them the information they need when
 they need it so they can make decisions or feel better 
when can't be with their baby.""Stuart Tomlinson As Seen On
We’ve reinvented the baby monitor with working parents in mind. BabyBit is a small wearable sensor you snap onto your baby’s clothing. It connects through your caregiver’s smartphone and sends you updates and notifications throughout the day about the things you want to know.


BabyBit was designed with one goal...to give new parents the information they need throughout the day when they can't be with their baby.




We use notifications to let parents know when something they
care about is happening. For example, when grandma picks up the baby from daycare mom
gets a notification. We felt that telling mom every time the baby cries
undercuts the caregiver and creates tension. Instead, mom sets the amount of time she wants to give the caregiver to attend to the baby and BabyBit only notifies her when that time is exceeded and she would want to get involved. 
We set up a series of these configurable notifications so parents can
choose what is important and what should cut through the noise of the day. The BabyBit app gives you additional detail when you want it.

Oversleeping on the weekend does NOT make up for the loss and is definitely NOT a solution for sleep deprivation. All these findings suggest that sleeping quality is directly related to your health.<br/><br/>Routine massage has been proven to boost serotonin. Without serotonin our bodies can't create melatonin, which influences the sleep stage of our circadian rhythm. Massage is a reasonable holistic solution to chronic insomnia and symptoms brought on by sleep deprivation. (3)</p><p>Although we are still currently conducting research on sleep deprivation, there is a reasonable amount of evidence supporting holistic solutions such as massage is a healthier therapy choice opposed to a quick fix narcotic.</p><p> </p><h2>Choose your perk</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478097061/tibksyvdn2ypkkw6yj6a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>$99     U-GYM Mini Standard Pack ($50 savings from retail)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475855289/fl0hkbe7j7etv9btcqx9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>$5     Thank you for supporting us!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475855305/yfcsnkj70qks0yxglfkx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>$39   Pack of Assorted Extra Pads</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478096989/frdwtx2lhcezfrcbmg58.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>$188 U-GYM Mini Double Early Pack ($110 savings from retail)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478097024/irhhqkfzuw5oihxi4kkf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>$277 U-GYM Mini Family Early Pack ($170 savings from retail)</p><p> </p><h3>Each U-GYM Mini Set Includes</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475942720/qhflvofgkja0pxenyvqe.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Each U-GYM Mini Set includes: U-GYM Mini device, one micro-USB cable, one 1-to-2 cord and four 5X5ch pads.</p><p> </p><h3>Pack of Assorted Pads Includes</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475942781/hae8dmqby5xtslgvge9g.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Assorted pad pack includes: </p><p>- 5x5cm/8pcs (2 bags) : For abs, arms and small areas.</p><p>- 5x9cm/4pcs (1 bag) : For abs, love handle, leg, shoulder areas.</p><p>- 7x13cm/2pcs (1 bag) : For love handle, back, thigh areas.</p><p>- 1-to-4 cord for use with 5x5cm &amp; 5x9cm pads.</p><p>Free shipping with any U-GYM Mini Set purchase.

In the media

Megan Rose Dickey @TechCrunch: ""I was able to try out the U-Gym muscle massager, and it was pretty cool.""
 

Lester Victor Marks @AppleInsider: ""The U-Gym product works well, and compares favorably with TENS units that cost almost five times as much."", ""On the whole, it gives a new user what they need: places to put the electrodes, and advice about which program of pulsations might be used for. Score: 4.5 out of 5""Marcus Chavers @NewsLedge: ""Number one reason? No massage therapist visits. For those of us not down with a stranger giving us a massage, that’s a huge plus. It also mimics the benefits of expensive and time-consuming treatments like cupping and acupuncture.""Mahit Huilgol @TechPP: ""Deep tissue massage is a messaging technique that focusses on realigning the layers of muscles and is often used for destressing and providing relief for muscle pain.""Tyler Lee @ubergizmo: ""U-GYM Mini uses medium frequencies for its massages, unlike other TENS devices that operate below 1kHz."", ""It is so small and easy to use, you could wear it under your clothes and no one would be the wiser. You could even get a massage while at work and your co-workers probably wouldn’t even know.""TestimonialsTrevor Owens: ""The quality of the product is very high, not like the cheap ones you see in most stores.

Oversleeping on the weekend does NOT make up for the loss and is definitely NOT a solution for sleep deprivation. All these findings suggest that sleeping quality is directly related to your health.Routine massage has been proven to boost serotonin. Without serotonin our bodies can't create melatonin, which influences the sleep stage of our circadian rhythm. Massage is a reasonable holistic solution to chronic insomnia and symptoms brought on by sleep deprivation. (3)Although we are still currently conducting research on sleep deprivation, there is a reasonable amount of evidence supporting holistic solutions such as massage is a healthier therapy choice opposed to a quick fix narcotic. Choose your perk$99     U-GYM Mini Standard Pack ($50 savings from retail)$5     Thank you for supporting us!$39   Pack of Assorted Extra Pads$188 U-GYM Mini Double Early Pack ($110 savings from retail)$277 U-GYM Mini Family Early Pack ($170 savings from retail) Each U-GYM Mini Set IncludesEach U-GYM Mini Set includes: U-GYM Mini device, one micro-USB cable, one 1-to-2 cord and four 5X5ch pads. Pack of Assorted Pads IncludesAssorted pad pack includes: - 5x5cm/8pcs (2 bags) : For abs, arms and small areas.- 5x9cm/4pcs (1 bag) : For abs, love handle, leg, shoulder areas.- 7x13cm/2pcs (1 bag) : For love handle, back, thigh areas.- 1-to-4 cord for use with 5x5cm & 5x9cm pads.Free shipping with any U-GYM Mini Set purchase. (Add $15 for shipping if only buys pads.) U-GYM Mini vs. the competitionU-GYM Mini specsOur missionWhen U-GYM founder and CEO Mark Yu received treatment for a shoulder injury three years ago, he discovered that professional electrotherapy is painless and highly effective. Still, having to travel to electrotherapy appointments was time consuming, inconvenient, and expensive. That’s how Mark ended up studying medium frequency stimulation with the goal to create a portable device.After successfully shipping the team's first product -- U-GYM Pro -- for sports and exercise enthusiasts, Mark received a lot of feedback and conceived a simpler, more consumer-friendly device designed to improve sleep quality. U-GYM Mini is the result of this collaboration with the community. Why does U-GYM Mini work? How do you mimic a real deep-tissue massage?Our core technology is based on digitally-controlled electrical muscle stimulation. U-GYM Mini uses medium frequencies (above 1kHz) to mimic a real massage. Most consumer TENS units use low frequencies which only stimulate shallow tissue to superficially block pain without penetrating the actual muscles. Low frequencies also tend to irritate the skin.By using medium frequencies, U-GYM can stimulate deep tissue like muscles and provide a more effective and comfortable massage. The immediate result is better nerve stimulation for pain control, but the longer-term benefit is improved blood circulation which eliminates toxins, relieves sore muscles, and helps you relax. We make complex technology simpleMedium frequency stimulation (above 1kHz) is commonly used in professional electrotherapy, but it typically requires large, stationary machines.After years of studying medium frequency stimulation, our team finally succeeded in implementing professional-grade electrical muscle stimulation in a small, light, and portable device.Most TENS units on the market use a simple, low frequency waveform (below 1kHz) which is less effective and can irritate the skin.U-GYM Mini uses multiple, simultaneous medium frequency waveforms to provide a real deep-tissue massage that effectively relieves muscle aches and pains.U-GYM's core technology mimics the massage techniques of a professional massage therapist using complex medium-frequency waveforms. It's like having a massage therapist with you right when you need to relax.With a relaxed body and improved blood circulation, you'll finally enjoy quality sleep.Stretch goalsAfter we meet our initial goal, we'll add the following rewards will to every machine (for backers who pledge $69 or more). Raise over $100,000 will add belt clip and lanyard to each U-GYM Mini SetRaise over $200,000 will add ??? to each U-GYM Mini Set (Will reveal reward after $100,000 is reached) Our Team Members MarkFounder / CEOMasters of Computer Science from New York University, Co-founder/CMO of AirSig, Inc., and founder of CARWAii.com.

The painful grinding and wearing away of your teeth at night or even during the day. Did you know that 1 out of every 10 adults and roughly 25% of children suffer from bruxism? Over 300,000 people search Google and Amazon every month looking for a solution to end their teeth grinding pain and costly bills associated with it.YES, there is a BIG Problem here!!! Unfortunately until now the only solution millions of people have had to help with teeth grinding has been dental guards which don't treat the problem, they just protect one's teeth. Dental guards don't stop you from grinding so you still wake up with a sore jaw, neck, and possibly migraines. The Bigger problems is when the current solutions fail and you may have to spend THOUSANDS of dollars at the dentist office for surgery to repair the damage. These are NOT solutions, they are bandaids!What if you found a solution? What if YOU could be the SOLUTION?  The Cost of Teeth Grinding
Over-the-Counter Mouthguards $15 to $300 per guard
Expensive Dental Guards from Dentist $400 to $1100 per guard
Teeth Replacement - $1000 -$3000 per tooth
Bridge $500 to $1200 per tooth
Crown $500 to $3000 per tooth
Lost work days/ productivity

<p>We created a revolutionary pad that is all natural. Our Flowreign pads do not contain any toxins, chemicals, or dyes. It is three times as absorbent as the leading brand AND cotton pads. The innovative material pulls in the fluid to the bottom of the pad for ultimate dryness and cleanliness. Our pads can be worn three times as longer than the leading brand pads AND cotton pads. Our pads also have technology which prevents odors and bacteria. This is something that both the leading brand pad and the cotton pad cannot compete with. Not only do our pads eliminate smells but it also helps prevents infections and other female health complications because of the all-natural negative ions that are present in our pads.</p>
<p>Our Flowereign products are also made of biodegradable material. This will affect the environment positively compared to the leading brand pads which is equivalent to 4 plastic bags for one pad. The leading brand pads are an environmental hazard as it will never degrade completely and the landfills are overrun with this product.</p>

<p><strong>Whats the Big Deal What We're Currently Using ?!</strong></p>
<p>What do Dioxin, Styrene, Furan, Chloromethane, and Chlorothane have in common? You guessed it right, our sanitary napkins. Nothing is more heart-warming than slapping on a pad and bracing yourself for all of the side effects that these chemicals can cause you. Gas for your car is expensive enough as it is, and although storing gasoline in as many places as possible to save on that monthly bill is tempting, placing them near your cherished, sensitive, and royal lady parts is not ideal.

</div></div>","We created a revolutionary pad that is all natural. Our Flowreign pads do not contain any toxins, chemicals, or dyes. It is three times as absorbent as the leading brand AND cotton pads. The innovative material pulls in the fluid to the bottom of the pad for ultimate dryness and cleanliness. Our pads can be worn three times as longer than the leading brand pads AND cotton pads. Our pads also have technology which prevents odors and bacteria. This is something that both the leading brand pad and the cotton pad cannot compete with. Not only do our pads eliminate smells but it also helps prevents infections and other female health complications because of the all-natural negative ions that are present in our pads.
Our Flowereign products are also made of biodegradable material. This will affect the environment positively compared to the leading brand pads which is equivalent to 4 plastic bags for one pad. The leading brand pads are an environmental hazard as it will never degrade completely and the landfills are overrun with this product.

What We Need & What You Get
We are asking for $150,000 to assist directly with the cost of mass production and working capital to get this product to the public.
So Whats in it for you ? Besides assisting us in bringing the product to the mass market we are offering amazing perks including soft cotton  FlowReign logo T shirts , Fashionable granite styled water bottles , Gift certificates worth over $200 (depending on your level) , Recognition on our 5K and 10K race t-Shirts , social media shout outs ,as well as exclusive tickets to our Annual Gala!  ( I know CRAZY right !)

 
Whats the Big Deal What We're Currently Using ?!
What do Dioxin, Styrene, Furan, Chloromethane, and Chlorothane have in common? You guessed it right, our sanitary napkins. Nothing is more heart-warming than slapping on a pad and bracing yourself for all of the side effects that these chemicals can cause you. Gas for your car is expensive enough as it is, and although storing gasoline in as many places as possible to save on that monthly bill is tempting, placing them near your cherished, sensitive, and royal lady parts is not ideal. Let’s talk about these chemicals and what they are. 
Dioxin and Furan ; Are like toxic chemical cousins and are a part of the dirty dozen.  Both of these products are found in pollutants  and are a cause for reproductive problems, issues with development, damage with the immune system, and the feared “C” word (cancer.)
Styrene; Its smoking ! You can find this in cigarette smoke and automobile exhaust.

<h3>GoGym Inception</h3>
<p>I felt a tinge of guilt as I walked past the hotel gym on my way to the hotel lounge for dinner. My flight in was long and stressful and it took much longer than expected to finish up at the airport. The hotel gym had almost nothing useful for an avid lifter and looking up local gyms, calling for pricing, and figuring out navigation reminded me too much of my recent flight. As I lazily browsed the gym options over a greasy meal I realized something - there was no place where gyms around me were consolidated, finding information on the gym website was nearly impossible and I was pushing the back button and restarting far too often. I looked at my keys on the table and saw my home gym member pass and wished that thing could swipe me in anywhere.... and so the GoGym idea was born.</p>
<p>We have been bringing on gyms around the country so when you end up in a new city because of work or pleasure our app will show you where all of our affiliated gyms are around you, their amenities and reviews. Two clicks later and you have a GoGym pass to use at that gym. We also did away with the sales pitches and paperwork we are all used to when using a guest pass. With GoGym you walk in and show the front desk the pass on your phone and get right to your workout, just like at home.</p>
<p>With your interest and help, together we can launch the first universal gym membership!</p>
<h3>Current Status</h3>
<p>We haven't just been grinding it out in the gym!</p>
<p>At the time of this Indiegogo launch GoGym has about 75 gyms on board spread among 5 states across the country. We have gyms in a few major cities in Florida, Georgia, Ohio, New York, and California. At the Arnold Classic this past March we aquired a 350 person list of future customers who couldn't wait for the app to come out. Now that we've got the business plan, regulations, vision and strategy ironed out we are ready to get after it with a solid business and solid plan.</p>
<h3>App Functionality</h3>
<p>Here is a rundown of how the app will function once you download it on your iphone.</p>
<p>GoGym uses geolocation to pinpoint where you are and show you where all our affiliated gyms are in relation to you. The gyms will be highlighted by a gold pointer. Clicking on one of these pointers will bring up a quick overview of the gym, its distance from you, its amenities, hours of operation and pictures. If you're more of a list kind of person there is an option to view gyms in the list view as well.</p>
<p>Once you have found a gym that suits your needs click the GoGym Pass button to activate your 24hr pass. It will then show you the Pass that gets you into the gym. On this pass will be listed your name, the gym name and address of the gym, and the remaining time you have to use the pass (24hrs). When you arrive at the gym you simply show the front desk the GoGym Pass on your phone, they will verify and you can walk right in and get lifting. Once your pass expires we will send you and email to find out how your visit to the gym was and ask you to, if you'd like, to review the gym. This way the gym managers know what they are doing good and what they can improve upon for future members and guests alike. That is the fundamental functionality of the GoGym app. There are of course other nuances and perks to explore once the app is downloaded, but this gives a real time explanation of what a typical experience would look like.</p>
<p> </p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The app is currently under construction and is estimated to be up on the app store mid February around the 12th.</p>
<p>While it is being developed we are looking to raise $11,000.</p>
<p>In the mean time and with your help this is what we will get accomplished:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete development of the initial GoGym app ($5,250) and begin development on an android app. </li>
<li>Continue pursuing our goal of obtaining a presence in the top 30 most traveled to cities in America. Our planned and budgeted out multi-city sales trips are around $1,600. To reach our goal we would need to do around 3 sales trips. If we reach our goal of $11,000 we will only do 2 (roughly $3,200) and work from there </li>
<li>Expand our advertising to get the word out to as many of our fellow fit friends as possible. With the app development and sales trips (2) we would have $2,550 left if we reach our goal of $11,000. Its a little low for an advertising budget but we believe acquiring more gym partners takes precedence initially.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thats it! just 3 main goals. To try and raise the funds we are selling discounted memberships. A typical base membership (5passes) is $60/month and unlimited is $110/month. </p>
<ul>
<li>For $50 get locked in at discounted rate and get a month free</li>
<li>For $100 get locked in at discounted rate, get a month free, and get exclusive beta version.</li>
<li>For $150+ get locked in for unlimited at discounted rate of $90, get a month free, exclusive beta and be featured as one of our 'founding lifters' on our social media.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we can make this work it will be the first universal gym membership. Our tight knit community of healthy, avid lifters will grow tremendously and help the current members to excel and future clients to gain the motivation to join our ranks. Also, 2% percent of every membership and a portion of company profit will go to the Challenged Athletes Foundation. Based out of California, but with a nationwide outreach, they provide opportunities and support to people with physical challenges, so they can pursue active lifestyles through physical fitness and competitive athletics.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether or not you have the means to purchase a full membership does't mean we're both SOL. Just like lifting there are other, just as important ways to help grow GoGym.</p>
<ul>
<li>Toss us $5, $10, $20 bucks ... every little bit helps!</li>
<li>Tell your friends and workout partners, especially those who travel often to check us out.</li>
<li>Write something about us on Facebook or Twitter!</li>
<li>Post a pic of you getting after it at the gym - or better- at a gym while you're on the road!</li>
<li>Let us know about any gyms in your area that would be interested in earning some extra travel traffic.</li>

The YoloScale will primarily measures weight and calculates BMI.  Owning the YoloScale gives you access to the YoloApp and community: Yolites can only sign up to the YoloApp by synchronizing their YoloScale with the app.(Available for IOS and Android) The YoloApp will recognize your device and guide you to complete your profile. Once you have access to the YoloApp, you will need to set your Weekly/Monthly/Yearly goals.  Once your Weight/BMI targets are set, The YoloApp helps you manage your goals. Now it's time to get to work, get social and earn rewards! With the YoloApp, you can track your progress by weighing yourself daily or at least once a week with the YoloScale.The YoloApp will also act as a dedicated social platform for documenting and sharing your journey. Four (4) main Upload categories will be available on the YoloApp.  1. Food and Recipes: You can keep track of your daily meals by uploading pictures; you can also share your pictures or recipes with fellow Yolites.2. Transformation pictures (TP): You can keep track of your progress by regularly uploading pictures of yourself; The YoloApp will automatically merge previous pictures with current ones side by side. You can also share your transformation pictures with fellow Yolites. 3. Activities: Under this category, you can share whatever fitness related activity you are currently performing to achieve your goals. You can share this with fellow Yolites as well. 4. Pets: This category is dedicated solely to pets. Don’t forget to share your cutest furry pictures with fellow Yolites. They too are very much part of your journey! With these 4 main categories; Yolites can surf recipes, activities, get motivated by transformations and ease the stress of the day with cute pet pictures. You can follow other yolites and be part of their journey, like and comment on pictures, build a following and be part of the community.    REWARDS! For every progress (Pounds/Kg lost or gained) made towards your set goals, points (Yollars) will be earned. Yollars are updated each time your phone synchronizes with your YoloScale.Note: While the YoloScale can be used by an unlimited number of people in the one-time weigh in mode, Only TWO (2) registered YoloScale users can have access to the YoloApp and YoloRewards at any given time.  Your Yollars will be accessed in your reward center and can be redeemed as exclusive discounts, deals, gift cards e.t.c, all geared towards fitness and health.  Splash your well-deserved Yollars and celebrate all your victories!TheYoloProject, Inc. will partner with both in-store and online stores to bring you the best deals that can be redeemed with your Yollars. Our reward system is simple! Meet your goals and let the YoloScale pay for itself! YoloScale Specification: • Dimensions: 440mm X 350mm X 45mm • Rechargeable li-ion battery • Music play time: 6 hours • Two inbuilt Bluetooth speakers•Touch screen display • Water and dust resistance to IP53. Pledges will be used to:   Finalize product design.Fund mechanical tooling of the product .Compliance testing – FCC, UL, CE. Order components .Pay for production, manufacturing & shipping costs of the first production run of the YoloScale.Complete backend for the YoloApp .Risk and Challenges:Manufacturing consumer electronics is challenging. Having several complex assemblies and components lead us to sourcing from several suppliers. With that comes two major challenges.The first is on time delivery of components used in the YoloScale and the second is receiving quality components that pass our high quality standards. Both of these may result in a delay in shipping of the YoloScale to Yolites.We will approach these challenges by using multiple suppliers when possible along with tight oversight of the entire manufacturing process. We really appreciate your support and believe in this project and will do all we can to ensure on time delivery of your YoloScale.",16.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Imagine receiving a message you feel, a communication without words. TACTonics™, LLC's patented Sensory Messaging technology makes this a reality. Using a sleek, wearable device called the TACTpuck™, this new dimension of digital communication allows Users to send discreet Sensory Messages, called TACTs, which will be felt through the Receiver's senses.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FOceko6FPQ0s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DOceko6FPQ0s&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FOceko6FPQ0s%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>The Receiver doesn't have to open, read or even look at your message. Instead, the Sensory Message is called a TACT™ because it's tactile, and sensed by touch. The free app TACTspace™ sends from a message from one phone, tablet or computer to another. A wearable device called a TACTpuck™ delivers the message directly and discreetly. A TACTpuck™is about the size of a quarter and can be worn anywhere against the skin. </p>

<h3>HOW WE DIFFER FROM HAPTIC MESSAGING </h3>
<p>We find the haptic messaging features on the new Apple iWatch both exciting and validating for our fully-patented Sensory Messaging technology. At TACTspace we consider Sensory Messaging a ""movement,"" not a ""feature.""  Here are the key differentials and advantages of using TACTspace.</p>
<p><b>Universal Language.</b>  While haptic messaging is a fun option for the new Apple iWatch, there is no universally recognized language. The User is limited to exchanging personal ""finger taps"" and ""heartbeats.""  TACTspace offers an infinitely wider range of both practical, and whimsical, messaging with a pre-determined menu of common messages paired with meaningful stimuli combinations.  TACTspace Users will be able to create their own unique messages and associated stimuli, but they will be able to start with an existing platform of language, universally understood by other TACTspace Users.</p>
<p><b>Freedom</b>.  We applaud Apple's efforts to free us from our phones, but TACTspace takes freedom to another level, in at least two ways. First, understand that unlike the iWatch, the TACTpuck wearable is not only much smaller, and more discrete, it does not have to be ""viewed"" to receive a Sensory Message (aka TACT Message).  And, since the TACT Message can be delivered without looking at the TACTpuck, the wearable does not have to be strapped to your wrist. It can be worn virtually anywhere on your person, against your skin. </p>
<p><b>Platform.</b>  The haptic messaging feature can only be used between two iWatch Users. Anyone who downloads the TACTspace mobile app will be able to send TACT messages to Users with the TACTpuck wearable. We envision the TACTspace app to be launched from any PC, laptop, tablet or smart phone, as well as social network sites like Facebook and CaringBridge.</p>
<p><b>Affordability.</b>  The Apple iWatch has a relatively high price point. We want to see all generations and demographics enjoy the next dimension of digital communications.  So, the TACTspace moble app is a free download. And, the TACTpuck is available for as little as $89USD.</p>
<p><b>Vision.  </b>The TACTpuck wearable V1.0 is only the beginning for TACTspace and TACTonics, LLC.  It is our way of introducing the world to Sensory Messaging. Our fully-patented technology will soon be available with more exciting stimuli, and integrated ""pairable"" peripherals.</p>

1. Select your friend in the TACTspace™ app 
2. Select your TACT™ message 
3. Click send!

















Imagine receiving a message you feel, a communication without words. TACTonics™, LLC's patented Sensory Messaging technology makes this a reality. Using a sleek, wearable device called the TACTpuck™, this new dimension of digital communication allows Users to send discreet Sensory Messages, called TACTs, which will be felt through the Receiver's senses.

The Receiver doesn't have to open, read or even look at your message. Instead, the Sensory Message is called a TACT™ because it's tactile, and sensed by touch. The free app TACTspace™ sends from a message from one phone, tablet or computer to another. A wearable device called a TACTpuck™ delivers the message directly and discreetly. A TACTpuck™is about the size of a quarter and can be worn anywhere against the skin.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2003 as a young adult with no family history or good understanding of this disease. As a type 1 diabetes patient I fully understand the challenges of living with diabetes. I have used syringes, insulin pens and insulin pumps as methods of injecting insulin into my body. However, I always had to carry insulin and syringes with me as primary or back up method of injection. </p>
<p>My condition as an insulin user allowed me to understand the short comings of the pre-filled insulin carrying cases available on the market; they do not fuction properly and are not visualy appealing.  Because these were not relible I had to carry a large amount of supplies with me at all times even if I was using other higher cost options such as an insulin pump and/or insulin pens. In additon, m<i>y back ground in the</i> design and manufacturing field for the last 20 years gives me an unique opportunity where I created this new product in order to improve my own life style and to help to improve the lifestyle of others living with this disease.  The goal is to provide an affordable pre-filled insulin syringe carrying case that people can afford whether they have access to insurance and more expensive options or not. </p>
<p>This pre-filled insulin syringe case was designed by somebody with diabetes for people affected by diabetes. This product is one of many products that I am looking forward to bringing to the marketplace with the objective of improving the life of people living with diabetes.</p>
<p>According to the American Diabetes Association approximately 34 Million of people have diabetes  in the US and 1 in 3 adults will have diabetes by 2050 if current trends continue.  </p>
<p>In addtion, <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">the cost of diabetes products and supplies are already prohibited for many individuals in the USA and around the world even with exisitng insurance coverage. </span></p>
<p>Purchasing this pre-filled syringe case you are not just purchasing a very good quality product, you are also helping to bring new ideas and products to the market that enhance the life of people living with diabetes at an affordable price for people living with this deases. Your contribution will also help to make a difference in the life of people living with diabetes needing a daily dosage of insulin to survive.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The initial product is completly designed by myself to keep costs low and mantain quality. A local injection molding company will design and manufacture the injection mold in additon to molding these cases.</p>
<p>This is a flexible campain with a minimum requirment of $6,000 to design and manufature the plastic injection mold. This initial goal includes the molding of intial parts to fullfill all crowfunding campain orders. The second target is to reach additional $16,000.00 to purchase a small injection molding machine in order start molding these cases on my own to keep them affordable.  </p>
<p>Therefore, this campain is for $22,000.00 with minimum goal of $6,000.00  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Disclaimer: Insulin and syringe not included in product. You will load your own insulin into your syringe and then insert into product.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By purchasing this product you will help to improve the life of people living with diabetes by creating low cost solutions that enhance their life style. This Pre-filled insulin syringe case is a cost effective alternative to significantly more expensive produsts such as insulin pumps and insulin pens. Your contribution will make this product more accessible to people that cannot afford more expensive products and/or provide a convenient cost effective back up options.</p>
<p>No insurance or high cost payments are required to purchase this product. So users will be able to carry their daily supply of insulin for a affordable cost without risking their monthy insulin vials.</p>
<p>Stylish and discreet this product can be carried in a purse, put in  shirt or pants pockets making it easily acessible while on the go!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Initially this product was designed for my own personal use as I chose to upgrade it through the years I was able to adress many possible design issues earlier on.</p>
<p>Many of the risks and challenges that go along with design and manufacturing the product have been addressed in the last 15 years as I have redesigned the product with the intention of improving the design and functionality of the product while mantaining affordability. So, design flaws were looked at earlier on and improved accodingly. Such as material choices to overcome rigidity, increase flexibility and appearance(I was sure people wanted more color choices than black and white!).</p>
<p>I will continue to assess throughout the life of the product ways to improve it including collecting feedback from consumers.</p>
<p>This product is also in the patent pending statge. </p>
<p>The highest risk/challenge that we may face is on the manufacturing side in regards to the injection mold or production.</p>
<p>However I have developed contacts in this industry for the last 20 years that produce high quality products, and my ultimate goal is to produce the product myself inhouse. </p>
<p>In addition, the decision of working with a local US manufactuter in OH is intended to keep all activities close to home while giving Americans jobs,  </p>

Many of the risks and challenges that go along with design and manufacturing the product have been addressed in the last 15 years as I have redesigned the product with the intention of improving the design and functionality of the product while mantaining affordability. So, design flaws were looked at earlier on and improved accodingly. Such as material choices to overcome rigidity, increase flexibility and appearance(I was sure people wanted more color choices than black and white!).
I will continue to assess throughout the life of the product ways to improve it including collecting feedback from consumers.
This product is also in the patent pending statge. 
The highest risk/challenge that we may face is on the manufacturing side in regards to the injection mold or production.
However I have developed contacts in this industry for the last 20 years that produce high quality products, and my ultimate goal is to produce the product myself inhouse. 
In addition, the decision of working with a local US manufactuter in OH is intended to keep all activities close to home while giving Americans jobs,

<p>The company team is made up of Andrea, a professional technical profile, specialized in the various types of materials and related processes, and Fabio, a professional profile oriented towards marketing and finance.</p>
<p>Our concern is to always identify innovative solutions that can respond to people's needs (continuously evolving), giving functional, effective and quick response. We do this using the principles of mechanics, inventing and creating functional and well designed objects.</p>

The company team is made up of Andrea, a professional technical profile, specialized in the various types of materials and related processes, and Fabio, a professional profile oriented towards marketing and finance.
Our concern is to always identify innovative solutions that can respond to people's needs (continuously evolving), giving functional, effective and quick response. We do this using the principles of mechanics, inventing and creating functional and well designed objects.
The product we intend to offer to the INDIEGOGO community is a PORTABLE DISPENSER named POCKET ROLL-ON equipped with an innovative dispensing system; it can be filled inside, according to the needs of the consumer, with different cosmetic solutions of various qualities, as long as they are liquid or in gel (cream, soap, hand sanitizer).
 





Its small size is able to guarantee the correct quantity of product essential to face the ordinary day activities at home and especially when you’re away. There is also a small closing cap which guarantees additional protection and prevents the product from drying out.

<p>The BLACK ACE® is a new generation underwater propulsion system designed and developed by Opcon Pte Ltd.</p>
<p>It was designed with the combat diver in mind, employing the use of cutting edge lightweight composite materials to increase stealth and operational range of combat dive operations. To that end, BLACK ACE® has met and exceeded the MIL-STD-810G military standards as laid out by the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>
<p>With an uncompromising focus on performance, reliability, and ease of operation at every stage of the design and manufacturing process, the BLACK ACE® has been sold and demonstrated to military and law enforcement units around the world.</p><p>The BLACK ACE® has been featured in the following media:</p><p><b>MAGAZINES</b></p><p></p><ul>

</div>
<div>The BLACK ACE® Sport will allow you to dive further and longer than ever before. By taking away the exertion required to fin yourself through the water, your breathing can be maintained at a lower rate, extending the amount of air available for your dive.</div>

<div><br/></div><div>The dual tank-mounted thrusters brings the thrust directly in line with your body's centre of mass. This means that all you need to do is to tilt your body in your intended direction, and off you go!</div><div><br/></div>
<div>Unlike underwater scooters, our hands free design means that your hands are free to check on gauges and operate other equipment. Perfect for photographers and videographers alike. It also helps in avoiding fatigue from gripping on to the underwater scooter for prolonged periods.</div><div><br/></div>
<div>Our ergonomic digital throttle control mounted on a pistol grip allows you to comfortably control your speed - cruise alongside your friends at finning speed, or ramp up the throttle to 2.5 knots and leave them behind.

</div></div>","What is BLACK ACE®?


The BLACK ACE® is a new generation underwater propulsion system designed and developed by Opcon Pte Ltd.
It was designed with the combat diver in mind, employing the use of cutting edge lightweight composite materials to increase stealth and operational range of combat dive operations. To that end, BLACK ACE® has met and exceeded the MIL-STD-810G military standards as laid out by the U.S. Department of Defense.
With an uncompromising focus on performance, reliability, and ease of operation at every stage of the design and manufacturing process, the BLACK ACE® has been sold and demonstrated to military and law enforcement units around the world.The BLACK ACE® has been featured in the following media:MAGAZINES
Asian Diver
Naval Forces
Wehr Technik
HIS Jane
TELEVISION
Channel NewsAsia
Channel 8


We have been studying ways to develop a simplified, cost-effective version of the BLACK ACE® to bring our product to you. After countless nights spent looking at ways to simplify the  design, we are now ready to take the next step forward in turning this vision into a reality.

The result, is the BLACK ACE® Sport.


Discover the Next Generation of Underwater Propulsion


The BLACK ACE® Sport will allow you to dive further and longer than ever before. By taking away the exertion required to fin yourself through the water, your breathing can be maintained at a lower rate, extending the amount of air available for your dive.

How does it work?
We have designed the BLACK ACE® Sport to be as simple to use as possible. 



The dual tank-mounted thrusters brings the thrust directly in line with your body's centre of mass. This means that all you need to do is to tilt your body in your intended direction, and off you go!
Unlike underwater scooters, our hands free design means that your hands are free to check on gauges and operate other equipment. Perfect for photographers and videographers alike. It also helps in avoiding fatigue from gripping on to the underwater scooter for prolonged periods.
Our ergonomic digital throttle control mounted on a pistol grip allows you to comfortably control your speed - cruise alongside your friends at finning speed, or ramp up the throttle to 2.5 knots and leave them behind. The BLACK ACE® Sport is even powerful enough for you to tow another diver along!


Our specially designed power cells allow more power to be delivered to the thrusters without sacrificing endurance.  However, if you do run out of power mid-dive, the BLACK ACE® Sport has been designed easy replacement even while you are underwater.
Discover the next generation of underwater propulsion.



What's Included

The basic BLACK ACE® Sport package comes with:


Systems Housing. The housing that contains the electronics and is able to withstand water pressure at a depth of up to 60m.



Thrusters. The BLACK ACE® Sport is designed to work with two thrusters, providing symmetrical thrust to push you effortlessly through the water.


Hand Controller. A four speed hand controller housed in an ergonomic pistol grip.


Battery Pack (144Wh). One rechargeable battery pack to power the BLACK ACE® Sport with up to 30 minutes run time. 


Battery Charger.  A UL-certified battery charger to charge your battery pack.


Cables. Cables to connect the systems housing with the thrusters and hand controller.




Optional Items

A wheeled carrying case to carry your BLACK ACE® Sport is available for purchase at $120.


You may also purchase additional battery packs to extend your dive time:





Standard Battery Pack (144Wh). $1,000. The standard battery pack that come with your Black Ace Sport. Up to 30 minutes of run time. Suitable for bringing on board airplanes under FAA regulations.


Large Battery Pack (360 Wh). $1,300. A larger battery pack that has a longer run time of up to 75 minutes. NOT suited for carrying on board airplanes.



About Edwin Yeo






Mr Edwin Yeo graduated in Mechatronics engineering, specializing in electro-mechanical applications. He is also a NAUI Specialty Diving Instructor, actively logged over 10,640+ dives to date. With over 19 years of extensive diving skills and robotics engineering knowledge, Edwin Yeo setup OPCON PTE LTD in 2008. Having knowledge in engineering and underwater knowledge, he began research in underwater propulsion. After several years of hard work, he finally found a way to stabilize weight-to-thrust ratio, bringing ""stabilize-high-thrust"" using small propeller to propel human load underwater. After achieving several military and safety certifications globally, he demonstrated the capability of BLACK ACE® Military to the global's forces, in which the BLACK ACE® is capable to carry fully loaded combat diver and its companion.
Now he is bring this same technology to the recreational divers.



So What's Next?
We need your help to turn our goal into a reality. We need $350,000 to purchase the equipment such as injection molds to move our designs into the production phase. All we need is your help to translate our existing mil-spec design into a more simplified consumer-friendly version.
With the funds and equipment, we will be able to begin full-scale production. The first units will be shipped out in Aug 2016.

Thanks to the contributors of our previous indiegogo campaign, the t'latte project, mirth manufacturing concern was able to deliver t'latte infuser factory production samples and fulfill contributor perks in 2014.  Here's a picture of our factory production samples:


Now, the factory is ready for the next step in production, but we need your help to make it happen...
We want to build on the momentum we started last year, and you can help! Reaching our goal gets us one step closer to production: $1500 USD covers the tooling costs for the mass-production moulds.

After some real-world testing, we've increased the top opening size, so it's less likely you'll have to trim the funnel to stretch it over your cappuccino machine's steam nozzle, we're also making it easier to fit the ball inside the funnel.



What We Need & What You Get
 We need pre-orders, contributions and consumer awareness to make our first mass-production of t'latte infusers happen.  You'll get a t'latte infuser, eventually, a delicious new way of making tea, and the good vibes inherent in helping with the concern's first official project. 
All of the money raised will go directly to cover our tooling costs in preparation for our first production run.  Once we've reached our goal, we'll get the tooling underway and ask for an expansion goal aimed at covering the unit production, packaging and shipping costs of our first production run (estimated at $25,000 USD).  Meanwhile, creator Garth Whelen continues to finance the intellectual property work through his own bootstrapping efforts, in the hopes to make commercial licensing of the t'latte process into the concern's first long-term fundraiser.  



Other Ways You Can Help
 Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",4.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>But not that is not enough! But we have many dreams and ideas. And with all fear and a bit of shame we decided to go forward with one of our ideas and ask for help, so then we can make at least this dream come true.</p>
<p>For me Ante, life was completely different and careless when I met Bruna. She's just so passionate about life, help others in a different magnitude than mine.

<p>Bruna has very bad sleep habits, but everyday when she's on my arms from the beggining till now I always've bounce her like a little  babe ( we are blush to reveal that, but it is true) and she does the same to me as well. Some of our friends don't understand, but OK.</p>
<p>From our troubles to sleep and a way to confort each other, we started to remember how good was to be held and be bounced till fail asleep or stop crying. Bruna is always cold and finding hard to sleep, so I call myself Baby Blanket.</p>

I received my Doctor of Physical Therapy degree from Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions and a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Utah in Kinesiology and Exercise Physiology.
I invented the ElectroCup with the hope that it will allow me, healthcare providers, and our patients find the relief and healing they need through Electro-Myofacsial Decompression Therapy.

What We Need & What You Get
Funding Goal: $35000

The Electro-Cup is an innovative creation that combines traditional cupping and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation to enhance your experience and results. Designed by doctors, this next generation in cupping aims at providing comfortable, lasting relief to sore parts of the body.

The Electro-Cup is constructed from durable, transparent polymers allowing for static and dynamic cupping and to monitor the decompression while in progress. The visibility also helps keep the cups be sanitized between uses.

Each Electro-Cup features inlaid metal strips that connects to a standard TENS Unit, allowing you to stimulate tissue throughout the use of the devices without compromising the vacuum seal. Regardless of age or experience level, anyone with body soreness or tension can learn to use the device in just a few minutes.

We have 4 different cups in 3 different sizes designed to fit and work on different parts of the body. The large works well on bigger areas like the back and legs, whereas the small works best on the feet and hands.

The Electro-Cup is capable of many different variations. You can use the 1 large 4 lead cup to have 2 seperate, crossing electrical currents within the field of the cup. You can also hook 2-4 of the Electro-Cups together to create larger areas of TENS stimulation. The positions and configurations are endless!
The Electro-Cup gives professionals a powerful tool to combat tension and discomfort- adding important value to their practice.

The Electro-Cup is versatile enough to be operated by one or two people in a home or gym environment, providing avid athletes, working parents, and those recovering from surgery an on-demand resource for relief.


The Electro-Cup is a finished product, already being used by people with great results. However the limitations of 3D printing prevent mass manufacturing. With the funding we receive, we will be able to purchase the expensive steel molds needed for injection molding. This will allow us to bring this great product to people in need throughout the world.

<p> </p>
<h3>1) Prickly pear oil is chock-full of vitamins</h3>

<p> </p>
<h3>2) It has a high percentage of unsaturated fatty acids</h3>
<p>These fatty acids absorb easily into your skin—without leaving that nasty, greasy residue behind. Plus, the fatty acids moisturize the collagen in your skin and tighten your pores. This leads to more elastic, younger-looking skin.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>3) So many antioxidants = so many skin benefits</h3>
<p>In addition to vitamins E and K, prickly pear seed oil has other antioxidants that do some serious work for your skin. These antioxidants increase cell turnover, restore elasticity, brighten your complexion, and reduce redness and dryness.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>4) Prickly pear seed oil is non-comedogenic</h3>
<p>The word “oil” might stress you out—but don’t worry. It’s non-comedogenic, which means that prickly pear oil can deeply penetrate your skin without clogging pores or causing breakouts.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>5) It works for all skin types</h3>
<p>Whether you have dry skin, sensitive skin, or mature skin, look out for skincare products that include prickly pear oil. You can’t go wrong.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2>Take a deep breath</h2>
<p>Our patented wristband contains several sensors that monitor pulse, movement, respiratory rate, and other physiological data in real-time. Algorithms detect personal snoring with an accuracy of 98% and trigger a vibration in the wristband. </p>
<p>The vibration is activated at a low intensity that changes according to your reactions while constantly learning a machine. <u><strong>Improving your sleep every night!</strong></u></p>
