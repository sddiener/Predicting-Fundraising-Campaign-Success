As part

<h2>So How Exactly Does it Work?</h2>
<p>The VUAA
molecule is unlike any other substance known to science because of the way it
specifically and narrowly interacts with a particular odorant receptor that
densely populates insects' antennae.  Specifically, VUAA interacts with a
receptor called Orco (this is the receptor that is unique to insects) which is
closely tied to and required for function of all the insects' other odorant
receptors.  When an insect comes into contact with VUAA, it signals Orco
to ""turn on"" all of the insects odorant receptors at the same time,
causing the irritating sensation of what amounts to smelling the worlds'
strongest imaginable scents all at once.  As one can imagine, this is not
a pleasant sensation and, not surprisingly, the insect flees instantly.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The beauty of
this discovery, however, lies not only in how effective the molecule is at
repelling insects (from both irritation and confusion), but in the fact that it
is likely to have little or no chemical activity (from a scientific standpoint)
outside of interacting with the highly specialized insect Orco receptor.
 This means that, because humans and other animals do not have an Orco
receptor, VUAA should have no impact on humans or animals at all.  </p>
</div><div>
<br/><h2>What We Need and What you Get</h2>
<br/><p>
</p>
<p>Citadel
Protectants, the company developing and commercializing VUAA, needs funding for
additional testing and formulation development efforts to bring this technology
to the global market.   Government regulations require extraordinary
testing to show efficacy and a lack of toxicity (initial toxicity tests have
shown no toxicity to humans or mammals), which cost millions of dollars and is
why typically only large multi-national chemical companies can bring new
solutions to market.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The initial $150,000 we currently
seek will provide necessary funding for independent laboratory testing to
support large-scale field trials and formulation.  This technology
promises to be one of the most impactful breakthroughs in the fight against
malaria and can change the use of pesticides forever.  However, this additional
testing is required to determine the best ways to deliver the technology in the
form of a usable product (i.e. spray, mist, etc.).  Supporting this
campaign will be a meaningful step towards reducing the use of pesticides
around the world as well as potentially saving the lives of millions.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>More than 600,000
people die of malaria each year.  Why?  Because in addition to the
absence of a practical medical solution against the pathogen, there is no safe,
practical way of keeping mosquitoes away from vulnerable people in developing
countries.  Until now.  VUAA has the potential to keep malaria-carrying
mosquitoes away from entire villages, thereby helping stop this deadly disease.
 This technology can literally change the world.  Who doesn't want to
be a part of that?</p>

In case you don't know what that means, I've lost the outermost layer my cornea and I'm in tremendous pain. The pain medication could destroy my corneas entirely, so I've just had to deal with the mind-numbing, excruciating pain.     What I Need
The good news is the doctor said it will heal. The bad news is it will happen again without surgery, hence why I am here asking for help. The surgery is $4,300 and is the equivalent of LASIK. I would love to get back to my normal life where I can be the Glamazon producer you've come to know and love where I'm not in constant pain half-blind. Here is where you come in.

<p>My name is Marjolaine and I am a close friend of Wendy's. I met Wendy through our place of business when she decided to start sharing her positive experience by teaching meditation weekly to co-workers. In my opinion, it has been Wendy's selflessness, gentle and giving spirit as well as her dedication that has seen Wendy's meditation class and her message of mindfulness grow larger than she ever could have imagined. Over these years our relationship has blossomed in to a friendship I am truly blessed to have. Wendy has become my confidant, cheerleader and someone I look up to. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/476317/files/20140401101923-Wendy_and_Marjolaine.JPG?1396372763"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Why I am doing this:<br/>
</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When I learned of Wendy's recent quest to obtain cancer reoccurrence monitoring (being a breast cancer survivor herself) and subsequent initial result being ""cause for concern"" I knew that I wanted to help but didn't know how.  Please know it is not cancer for certain but that if it is, it was caught very early thanks to Wendy's being proactive (further testing will provide more concrete answers.) As my family has directly been affected by life threatening disease (losing my mother to pancreatic cancer in late 2013) I understand what a burden the question ""How can I help?"" can be, as it is often exhausting trying to understand and/or put into words what you need.  </p>
<p>It was when I spoke with Wendy further and she provided additional details into her decision to pursue an integrative approach to her health care (<a href=""http://meaningfulwesternlife.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/allopathic-alternative-and-integrative-health-care/?preview=true&amp;preview_id=1340&amp;preview_nonce=4944159a84&amp;post_format=standard"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Please click here for more info on Integrative Health</a> featured on Wendy's personal Blog), that I learned that most testings and treatment would be coming out of her pocket. Wendy has started immunotherapy treatment (that is very promising) to boost the immune system and therefore eradicate any cancer. In learning of the financial cost and her amazing treatment already underway, the question to how I could help became clear. With Wendy's blessing (based solely on her quest to spread awareness (see more below.)) I have created this page so that we can all come together and help provide the support, financial freedom to choose her own path to health and the peace of mind Wendy has so willingly taught us over the years.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What I am requesting:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>At this time I have created a small completely attainable goal of $1000. I have seen the amazing amount of people Wendy has positively affected at work and I have no doubt that her reach extends far beyond that. All funds will go directly to Wendy herself so that she can put them towards the expenses of treatment and testing that has already amounted up to more than $7000! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Wendy's Plan to Pay it Forward:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As I stated before, Wendy has allowed me to create this page based solely on spreading her story. Her goal is to be able to share her learning's a few months down the road when this treatment has been successful. She plans to share with a wider audience through her blog called <a href=""http://meaningfulwesternlife.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MeaningfulWesternLife</a>. I suggest that you take the time to enjoy her blog as she has many wonderful postings related to <strong><em>cultivating joy and meaning in a western society lifestyle. </em></strong>by clicking the link above, you have access to all of her posts but you may like to sign up by entering your email address on her website so you will get notifications of posts relating to her treatment, learning's and success. These important lessons are about taking a proactive, integrative approach to one’s own health and having the courage to seek beyond the mainstream system when needed; otherwise your options are very limited. Already many people are seeking the knowledge Wendy has gained.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How to Donate:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Please note there are two options if you choose to donate financially. You may donate directly through credit card or using PayPal. You do not have to own a PayPal account to donate through this option (you can use it as a guest.) It is important that you understand the limitations that a wonderful page like this involves and it does come at a cost. Although Indiegogo charges the lowest amount I could find on fundraising pages, a per transaction cost of 3% will be deducted and in addition a 9% fee will be deducted from the donation total. The great news is that if (and when :) ) the donation goal is met (or exceeded) the fee will lower to 4% PLUS PayPal transactions will be credited by 5%. Please be aware that credit card donations will not be received by Wendy until 2 weeks after the closing date and that PayPal transactions are immediate so I gracefully request that you consider PayPal as your primary donation option.</p>
<p>Please understand that a financial donation is by no means expected nor the only way to show your support. Wendy is grateful to receive your caring, friendship, healing and well wishes. For those of you familiar with her meditation teachings-please take the time to send her healing white light.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With the majority of the population in Ghana, Africa under
the age of 24, the country’s future prosperity will depend on how well their
youths survive and thrive. Population estimates show that 38.9% of Ghanaians
are under the age of 14. Many are disadvantaged missing one parent or both
making it difficult for them to find their best path and avoid poverty and
other traps. Reaching this generation with positive reinforcement,
encouragement and direction can help build a more prosperous tomorrow for the country.
That’s where the Keno Project comes in…</p>

<p></p><p>The Keno Project helps young Ghanaians living in towns and
villages find their true path by nurturing their natural talents. The first
phase of the project is to provide a venue for children and young adults to
exhibit their natural talents and be recognized and rewarded for them. The first
of several “Talent Shows” is scheduled for Dec. 24<sup>th</sup> with try-outs
starting now. More than 50 contestants can be accommodated in the show with awards
given out to the top three winners. Every participant receives a Certificate of Completion and the satisfaction and confidence from having participated in such

give. What Happens if We Don’t Meet Our Goal?The show must go on!! Posters are up and auditions start this Sunday – we’ll not turn back now. However if we come up short, we’ll have to make some adjustments like either going without the stage, giving up the chairs, cancelling the food and drink for the performers, or offering lesser prizes. But that would be sad!!Please help us make this event the best it can be with all the trimmings!What Happens if We Exceed Our Goal?We’ll be ecstatic and grateful to all who contributed! PLUS any money left over after expenses are covered will go towards our next talent show in 2014. That’s right - this is the first of many such events. We intend to grow this idea into a regular cadence of events and eventually reach self-funding status.

We truly appreciate your willingness to understand and support this very sensitive and very personal need.<br/><br/>AN INTRODUCTION TO JES: Jes Ryan Bradshaw is a 27 year old individual from Houston, TX now living and working full time in Portland, Oregon. Jes is a goofball with an incredibly kind heart and a passion for people.  Jes has struggled with gender identity since childhood. Despite trying to fit into a mold designed by social norms, Jes has never associated comfortably with the female gender.  Jes identifies as androgynous, and is still very much in the thick of finding a pronoun that fits.</p>
<p>Jes has been using a binder, which compresses the chest area, for about a year now (imagine a modern day corset). This has helped reduce anxiety associated with body identity issues, but binding is not sustainable long term given it’s health risks, and it's time for a positive change. After careful thought and with the immense support of Jes' therapist and loved ones, Jes is scheduled to have top surgery performed by Dr. Michael Brownstein in San Francisco in May.</p>
<p>Here’s an intro to Dr. Brownstein, if you’re curious:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WEA3p1Eq3U"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WEA3p1Eq3U</a><br/>---</p>
<p>WHAT ARE THE COSTS OF SURGERY? Unfortunately, this surgery is not cheap, and Jes’ insurance will not cover a dime. The cost of surgery alone will be $8,500. Because the outpatient surgery is not available locally, Jes will have to travel to San Francisco for the 10 day process. Thanks to the generosity of Jes’ family, the only funds now left to raise are in support of airfare, food, lodging, and the cost of time off work during the healing process! Since work in Weatherization requires extensive physical labor, and Jes’s chest will require about three months to fully heal, Jes will also likely be out of work during a good portion of the healing process. These remaining costs are estimated to total $3,000.</p>
<p>WHY JES DESERVES YOUR SUPPORT: For those of you who may not know Jes closely, you should know that your support is well deserved. Jes is just one those few people who are impossible not to love. Jes is extraordinarily compassionate, giving, and a true spirit-lifter. In spite of saving carefully, Jes’s current income will not support these costs in full. As loved ones and trusted allies, we turn to you. Any little bit you can spare, be it in the form of money, encouragement, well wishes, drawings, cards or experiences, will be greatly appreciated. We know Jes will be overwhelmed with gratitude by anything you are willing and able to contribute on this tremendously powerful journey.<br/><br/>“There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside of you” -Maya Angelou</p>

<h3><strong>Background of The Project</strong></h3>
<p>In 2008, while filming the award-winning documentary “Vibration for Healing, the Sound You Feel” we featured Judith Kahealani Lynne, as she sounded with the dolphins in Kona, Hawaii. She was one of 20 sound healers featured in the documentary. (<a href=""http://www.cezeproductions.net/featured-film/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.cezeproductions.net/featured-film/</a>)</p>
<p>Although she was unaware of it, she was already suffering from Parkinson’s.  In 2010, after a two-year struggle, Judith - a trained musician - started to use her self-developed “vocal energetics” on herself. As she got stronger, she began to work again. Now she hopes to share her work with a larger audience. </p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>“My exploration of the Parkinson’s world revealed studies showing the benefits of meditation, qigong, tai chi and a voice program<em><span style=""color: #222222;"">s for voice and speech improvement.</span></em></em><em> Quickly I recognized the value of the Vocal Energetics™ program for Parkinson’s as it included elements of each of these items and more. I revamped, mainstreamed and offered workshops. Attendees with PD reported improved balance, improved vocal projection, diction and melody, diminished or ceasing of tremors, and mood elevation. The toning meditation practice was helpful especially for those who find difficulty in quieting the mind, which can be a challenge for a person with PD as worry, agitation, and suffering anxiety about possible futures are typical emotional expressions. The deep peace felt by being in present moment, lowers the pulse and blood pressure, calms all systems of the body and supports mental clarity.” - Judith Lynne</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>By the spring of 2012, as Judith Lynne was giving workshops at national Parkinson’s Conferences, she was asked to make a DVD of her work available so that participants could take the “work” home and continue all the exercises they were taught. She asked us to produce it. We agreed that this DVD would provide an incredible tool to help people with Parkinson’s in meeting their journey.</p>
<h3><strong>The Project</strong></h3>
<p>Because Judith shares her time between Portland, Oregon and her spiritual home in Hawaii, it is in these two locations that this video project is being produced.</p>
<p><strong>The first part</strong><strong> </strong>of this project was the creation of a short toning/meditation video. Graciously funded by the Lyman Fund, it is now posted on a YouTube site <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMXnEsrWmV8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMXnEsrWmV8</a> and a Vimeo site <a href=""https://vimeo.com/72166178"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/72166178</a></p>
<p><strong>The second part</strong> of the project is the creation of a full-length DVD which will include a documentary about Judith Lynne, her journey and her work. For the PD community, the producers feel that the most important part of the DVD will be the special features. These features will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a short toning/meditation</li>
<li>a long toning/meditation</li>
<li>specific vocal exercises</li>
<li>exercises to relieve the Parkinson's mask</li>
<li>segments of Judith’s workshop presentations, used as reinforcements</li>
<li>the role of body movement, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The completed DVD will be made available at nominal cost primarily to workshop participants, so that, through the special features, the PD community will be able to continue their progress in ""partnering with Parkinson's.""</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Financial Goal and Projected Use of Funds</strong></h3>
<p>We've set a minimum goal of $28,800 to cover the costs of travel, lodging, production and post-production of all additional material to complete the DVD. In addition, we will supply 1,000 replicated copies of the DVD.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why you may want to sponsor us</strong></h3>
<p>All of us know someone struggling with PD. In recent years, the interest in the use of alternative healing modalities has grown rapidly as People with Parkinson's (PWPs) search for avenues of managing their symptoms and increasing their quality of life. And everyone is hopeful that at some point a cure will be found.</p>
<p>Vocal EnergeticsTM offers an especially unique way to address multiple symptoms of Parkinson's. Not only does it help with the motor symptoms of balance, integrated movement, tremors, posture, swallowing, good breathing and vocal production, it also assists in meeting the non-motor issues of self-confidence, worry, depression, hopelessness, integrated and authentic expression, social inclusion, focused thought, peace of mind, and living in present moment.</p>
<p>Your support for the production of this DVD will help many people who find themselves ""suffering"" from Parkinson's. They will have a powerful tool to assist them in meeting their symptoms, even possibly to lessen the need for increased doses of pharmaceuticals that over time have difficult side-effects. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>“Parkinson's is a Path of the Warrior. In order to meet the challenge we must draw on all the strength that we can muster from within. It is essential that we gather the resources - physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually -  to meet these conditions, to not be over-powered by them, but to truly ""partner with Parkinson's"". In that way, Parkinson's calls out the best from within each of us.</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Vocal Energetics has been an invaluable tool for me in my journey with PD. I know that it can and will serve others well, too.” - Judith Lynne</em></p>
<p>This DVD will be extremely useful, educational and most of all – extremely practical. As filmmakers, the Ceze Films team concentrates on projects that document people in their quest for more spiritual, healthful and earth-friendly life styles. In this spirit we want to help Judith Kahealani Lynne make this possible.</p>

<p>Hi Friends,</p>
<p>We are a few creative entrepreneurs trying to live a more conscious and healthier life. We absolutely believe that creative thinking can solve everything. <strong>The main point of our brilliant business idea is to connect the fulfillment of a simple, basic human need with the solution of an enormously important, acute world-wide problem.</strong></p>
<p>Our products which will fulfill the simple human need are organic socks made in India. The acute problem that we try to solve is air-pollution. How is that possible?<strong> No, your feet won’t smell better. But there will be more trees out there!</strong></p>
<p>Why organic? Well, we all know that wearing organic clothes feels good for the body. In contrast to regular cotton, organic fibers are hypoallergenic. Their advantage is that they are free of chemicals and pollutants. Moreover, we realized that “eco-fashion” has become trendier than ever. Soft, organic cotton clothes like t-shirts, trousers, underwear are getting more and more “in”<strong>. We also realized that wearing them means saving money. It’s been proved that organic cotton lasts for more than 100 machine washes before the fibers begin to break apart.</strong></p>
<p>But the beauty of our business idea is that it’s not selfish. We decided to make a step forward: we care not only about the consumer, but ABOUT THE WORLD. The main point is: <strong>after each pair of socks sold, we plant a new tree. It’s that simple.</strong> So, buying a pair of Karmasocks means the planting of a new tree. This way, wearing our product becomes one of the easiest ways to support the environment. The system will be absolutely transparent and the buyer will be able to easily follow the planting of “his tree”.</p>
<p>Moreover, Karmasocks are made according to the environmental principles of fair trade. This means that our socks are being produced in safe work environments, where responsible trade relations and equal employment opportunities are provided, in order to positively impact communities. It’s known that regular cotton farming involves a huge amount of chemicals that results in an unsafe work environment for employees. One of the greatest benefits of organic clothing is that the growing process of the cotton is nontoxic. This way, a healthy environment for both our employees and locals is guaranteed.</p>
<p><strong>We need your support</strong></p>
<p>We live in a world where even a brilliant idea needs some financial support to become a real business. <strong>To get our production started, we would need US$ 4,500. </strong></p>
<p>If you are pro health, pro environment, and you like nice, comfortable socks with a timeless design, don’t let our idea remain only an idea. Let it become reality! Please support us whatever level you're comfortable with. With your help we can soon start producing socks for a healthier life and planting trees for a cleaner air and a better future.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your support,</strong></p>

<p>FAQ:</p>
<p><strong>1. Where are our socks made and who makes them? </strong><br/>Our high-quality socks are made in India, by a company which is certified to produce fair trade socks and the only one to use organic cotton.</p>
<p><strong>2. How can I be sure that there will be a tree planted after I buy a pair of your socks? </strong><br/>In cases of such great endeavors it is crucial that we concentrate our powers. Rather than planting the trees ourselves, every Friday we will donate 1 USD for every pair sold for the Plant a Billion Trees Campaign. The Plant a Billion Trees campaign (<a href=""http://adopt.nature.org/plantabillion/brazil/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://adopt.nature.org/plantabillion/brazil/</a> ) is an effort to restore 10,100 km2 of land and plant 1 billion trees by 2015 in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. The campaign was launched in 2008 and is one of the largest tree planting programs in the world. Each donated dollar results in one planted tree in the Atlantic Forest. For those who still worry about the transparency of the whole system: once a year we will be audited and we will publish this on our website, so the audience will be totally able to follow our activity. More</p>
<p><strong>3. OK, but what does organic mean, anyway?</strong><br/>Organic cotton is produced according to the internationally recognized organic farming standards of the EU regulation 834/2007, of the USA National Organic Program (NOP), the Indian National Program for Organic Production (NPOP) or the Japanese Agricultural Standard (JAS). More simply put, organic cotton is produced of non-genetically modified plants, grown without the use of any synthetic agricultural chemicals such as fertilizers or pesticides. Here you can learn more about organic cotton: <a href=""http://www.organiccotton.org/oc/Organic-cotton/Benefits-of-organic-cotton/Benefits-of-oc.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.organiccotton.org/oc/Organic-cotton/Benefits-of-organic-cotton/Benefits-of-oc.php</a></p>
<p><strong>4. And what about fair trade? What does this involve in your case?</strong> This means that our socks are being produced in safe work environments where workers get a fair salary. NO, our socks are NOT made in sweat shops. The company is certified at the Fairtrade Foundation: <a href=""http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/what_is_fairtrade/default.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/what_is_fairtrade/default.aspx</a></p>
<p><strong>5. Who designs the socks? </strong><br/>In which colors and sizes are they available? Socks are being designed by our in-house designers. We start with plain socks in 4 colors: black, red, green and blue. If we grow, we plan to collaborate with our customers regarding new, fancy designs.</p>
<p><strong>6. If I decide to buy a pair of socks, should I pay for shipping? </strong><br/>Shipping costs are included for USA and Europe.</p>
<p><strong>7. I could buy any kind of socks and then go out and plant a tree by myself! Why is it worth for me to buy YOUR socks? </strong><br/>Yes, you can, and we would be happy if you would also plant a tree yourself. But honestly, how many trees have you planted until now? And how many socks have you bought during your lifetime? Do you see the difference…? If there would have been a company offering what we offer you, there would be at least 100 trees more on Earth, only because of you. Wouldn’t it be beautiful?</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Juliet, or Julz for short. I’m a 38 year old transwoman or male-to-female  transgender individual. As an teen, I wanted so badly to look like women I saw on television and my friends in high school. I hated myself for not having the body that I wanted, for instead having a body that didn’t even feel like mine. As I grew older, I thought I could learn to accept that this was the body I was given and it’s the only one I’m going to get. So no matter what, I’m going to try to make the best of it in any way I can. This didn’t work out as well as I had planned.</p>
<p><strong>My transition</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to look in the mirror and not recognize the body that you see. It’s depressing  and demoralizing. Thankfully we live in modern times and there are options available for girls like me. I started HRT 2 years ago and the changes have been fantastic. Little by little each day, I move closer to my ideal. <strong>I can’t describe how wonderful it is to see myself becoming the woman I have longed to be.</strong> But each day, I see my chest, and although there has been minimal growth, knowing that my body is still wrong in a rush of sadness, alienation, and anxiety. So daily I wear padding to mimic full breast and no low cut shirts. This causes me to suffer the side effects of sweat rashes, heat blisters, and daily irritation.</p>
<p>My family, while in the past being supportive of the choices I made, when I came out to them, they didn’t  really support me at all,since then they have made some progress to accepting me for who I am,but not much more, but time will tell the future . My decision to get surgery or any kind of medical intervention involving my gender, was solely on me, so I am financially on my own. I would not be able to afford the hormone treatments if it wasn’t for the care of the VA directive that was released in 2011 covering the treatment of transgendered veterans. Only then was I able to afford the meds needed.I have also been in therapy for some time and can provide the required letter of recommendation, saying that “<strong>transgender surgery is the next step in the transition process</strong>”, a qualification also provided by the Trans Standards of Care (WPATH).</p>
<p>For me, top surgery represents the biggest joy I can imagine, starting from when I was entering puberty. After years of research, advice, and self-reflection, I’ve made the final decision to pursue top surgery. At the end of the procedure, I will have a well-developed female chest. <strong>But the most valuable part of the surgery is that I will finally feel at home in my own body</strong>. All I want is to be happy and this is the key to it.</p>
<p>So I am humbly asking for your help and support to make this possible, to make my dream a reality, and bringing me one step closer to being myself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I need your help!</strong></p>
<p>Top surgery is very expensive, especially for a young woman  that has returned to college attempting to make her way in the world. I’m currently a CNA and have applied for the nursing program, but the pay as a CNA is dismal and most of it goes to pay for rent, bills, food, so that I can survive. In this situation, it’s very difficult to find the money to put away for something that will help me thrive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So this is where you thoughtful  folks come in. Here’s the breakdown of surgery costs.</p>
<p>Surgeon fees: $3500</p>
<p>Actual cost of the implants alone(Silicone): $1450</p>
<p>Anesthesia fee: 980</p>
<p>Facility fee(hospital costs): 1546</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Total for this brings it to ; 7476.00</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This seems like an insurmountable cost, but no amount is to small or too great. Every donation is a little piece of joy, a smile just for you, knowing I am one step closer to my dream, my one hope, becoming a reality.</p>
<p>Even if you can’t personally contribute,  please pass the word along. Send this to your friends and neighbors and allies. Because this surgery will literally change my life. For the first time, I will be able to feel my body and not feel dysphoria and pain; there will only be joy, happiness, and possibility. And that truly is the greatest gift of all.</p>
<p> </p>

Who am I?
My name is Juliet, or Julz for short. I’m a 38 year old transwoman or male-to-female  transgender individual. As an teen, I wanted so badly to look like women I saw on television and my friends in high school. I hated myself for not having the body that I wanted, for instead having a body that didn’t even feel like mine. As I grew older, I thought I could learn to accept that this was the body I was given and it’s the only one I’m going to get. So no matter what, I’m going to try to make the best of it in any way I can. This didn’t work out as well as I had planned.
My transition
It’s hard to look in the mirror and not recognize the body that you see. It’s depressing  and demoralizing. Thankfully we live in modern times and there are options available for girls like me. I started HRT 2 years ago and the changes have been fantastic. Little by little each day, I move closer to my ideal. I can’t describe how wonderful it is to see myself becoming the woman I have longed to be. But each day, I see my chest, and although there has been minimal growth, knowing that my body is still wrong in a rush of sadness, alienation, and anxiety. So daily I wear padding to mimic full breast and no low cut shirts. This causes me to suffer the side effects of sweat rashes, heat blisters, and daily irritation.
My family, while in the past being supportive of the choices I made, when I came out to them, they didn’t  really support me at all,since then they have made some progress to accepting me for who I am,but not much more, but time will tell the future .

<p>My name is Pamela. I have been working with Abby’s mother Tricia for three years. I am a friend and their entire family is full of great people too. On September 24<sup>th</sup>, Tricia found out she will no longer have a job after December, they are eliminating her position. Two days later, results from a biopsy taken on September 21<sup>st</sup> came in and the doctors wanted them to come in right away. Abby has Acute Myeloid Leukemia, AML, which is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow rarely seen in people under the age of 40. It is also a rapidly progressing cancer so upon detection, immediate chemotherapy is necessary for any chance of success. They started that night and have been going ever since and I know from experience, that is a scary way to begin cancer treatments. The treatments for this leukemia often stretch for years because it has a high relapse rate. Stretching the treatments out helps lower the chances of relapse. But, this means many 3 weeks stays in the hospital and away from home because this is an inpatient procedure.</p>
<p>I felt compelled to begin this campaign because Abby is such a special little girl and because Tricia is a good friend. My husband died from cancer just over a year ago so I am very aware of what they are going through and what they may face. And with Tricia about to lose her job, this family needs a miracle and I hope we, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">you and me</span>, and give it to them! Every dollar given, every link forwarded allows Abby’s parents to focus on HER and not how they are going to pay the bills, as it should be.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We have set a modest goal but in all honesty, this is going to be a marathon and will go on for years. Hopefully Tricia can get another job soon but this is hardly the optimal time to be looking for work, even with a healthy family. Every single dollar we raise will go to Abby's care and keeping her life stable so she can use her energy to fight this battle. It will also allow the people she wants around her the most, her parents, to be there for her, day and night. A hospital is no place for a young child to be without parents.</p>
<p>Please look for updates regarding Perks. We will putting together some ideas and hope to have more cool things for you guys in the future. I wanted to get this started right away. If you have any questions, my email is at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Your impact will be huge and immediate. This family is going through so much right now, as many of us are, but having such a serious disease to deal with is extra tough. Just knowing that there are a bunch of people out here in the world working to raise funds so they can be free to concentrate on the most important thing in their life is a huge weight off their shoulders.</p>
<p>When my husband and I found out he had Stage 4 esophageal cancer two years ago, we did not know this tool existed. When he passed away 18 months after diagnosis, the bills were huge and he left little. Every little bit helps, I promise!! This is such a great way to help people and make a HUGE difference in their life without a huge sacrifice from ourselves. Please, help me help them keep their focus where it needs to be, on Abby and getting her better.</p>

<p>The Memorial is located in the heart of the West Village at the corner of Greenwich Avenue and 7<sup>th</sup> Avenue South and has been featured in television shows, movies, and music videos. The tiles hang on a rusted, chain-link fence surrounding property owned by NYC’s MTA.</p>

<p>Her name is Seyran ""Sarah"" Cinar, we’ve been going out for over a year now and in the past 7 months. Sarah has been experiencing some horrible conditions, severe asthma and stomach problems which doctors have not been able to specifically diagnose. These cause Sarah to be admitted into hospital and ICU for long durations which affect her university studies. Due to living in a small town she regularly is required to travel long distances to see specialists.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because I wish to see my girlfriend living a better life and in less pain. If I could even raise the smallest of funds I know it would help her and her family pay for some of her medication and doctor and specialist visits outside of town. Her parents are consistently taking time off work to take care of her and had to leave one of their jobs to take care of her during the day, I also do this on a regular basis to assist her.</p>
<p>The funding raised would contribute towards her medication as she is on 13 different medications, the ones I am aware of are, Ventolin, Symbicort, Alvesco, Attrovent, Seretide, Prednisolone, Nexium, Buscopan, Tramadole and has brought two nebulisers, one which she is required to take with her everywhere she goes. The reason she is on so many preventer puffers is due to her specialist suggesting she takes an aggressive approach to prevent the asthma attacks.</p>
<p>The steroids Sarah takes for her asthma have been suggested by the doctors to have an impact on her stomach. The doctors are yet to figure out what is wrong with her stomach, Sarah has had a gastroscopy and many other tests to determine what the problem was but nothing has been determined as of yet.</p>
<p>The medical staff in our area have been wonderful, but they cannot do much other than temporarily treat her asthma attacks. This is why I am trying to raise funds, she is only 19 years old and I wish she didn’t have to go through all these problems.  I would love it if you shared this with all your friends and family. Please help me help her.</p>
<p>May God bless you all and thank you for taking your time to read this.</p></div>","Hello all, my name is Fraser and I am writing a campaign to support  my wonderful girlfriend and family who are in need of our help.

I am an inventor, that is a victim of Illegal Implantation that is in need of removal of an Illegally implanted device. This device is  designed to track a person while in the privacy of thier private life. I have been threatned to either hand over my inventions or I will be killed for them, ""truth"".</p>
<p>   Well I am telling the truth and have more evidence then any other victim of this same crime. I am famous for speaking out against this crime and winning cases in court for this same crime. If one is to just google my name they can find my cases online. I have been published in many magazines as well as newspapers sold around the world. The most recent coverage of my case is printed in over 35,000 copies being sold on the newstand of Fortean Time issue number 243 2011. Just to check the validity of my claims to you, please do read this article to confirm. It's legit!  <a href=""http://www.forteantimes.com/features/fbi/5383/a_game_of_tag.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.forteantimes.com/features/fbi/5383/a_game_of_tag.html</a>   </p>
<p>  This is real and its expensive to get removed! I have been pumping out thousands to just protect my inventions as well as my family from this crime. As, you will see in the video as well as this article above, I am currently trying to stop this crime against myself and others. I have spoke out in Washignton DC against this crime and have also been the driving force for laws to be implemented against this same crime that I am a victim of. So, Please take the time to go over these House Bill's as well as the Senate Bill's too to validate the concern, as well as what I am speaking of.As, to the truth!</p>

<h4 class=""teal bold"">New California Law Forbids Forced RFID Implantation in Humans</h4>
John Kuzin <br/>November 2007 | <em>Privacy In Focus</em> <br/><p>California has enacted a statute prohibiting the compelled or coerced implantation of a subdermal identification device, such as a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) microchip or a newer chipless ""RFID tattoo."" The new law does not impact voluntary implantation. California now joins Wisconsin and North Dakota as states that have banned forced RFID implantation. Florida is among several states considering a similar law. <br/><br/>The new California statute (SB No. 362, now Chapter 538) was approved by Governor Schwarzenegger on October 12. It establishes a new Civil Code Section 52.7, which provides that ""no person shall require, coerce, or compel any other individual to undergo the subcutaneous implanting of an identification device."" It creates a civil action under which a person implanted may recover a ""civil penalty"" of no more than $10,000 per implant and no more than $1,000 ""for each day the violation continues,"" actual damages and compensatory damages, as well as injunctive relief. Punitive damages may be awarded on proof of the defendant's ""malice, oppression, fraud or duress"" in requiring device implantation. This statute becomes effective on January 1, 2008. <br/><br/><strong>Why the Statute Believed Needed</strong><br/>Recent RFID technology advances in microchip miniaturization have resulted in the development of hundreds of new RFID-enabled products, including devices designed to identify, track and monitor people. The sponsor of the California law, State Senator Joe Simitian (D-Palo Alto), introduced the bill after learning that a Cincinnati surveillance company, Citywatcher.com, had required employees who work in its secure data center to have an RFID chip implanted in an arm. <br/>In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved VeriChip Corporation's use of an RFID tag for human implantation to allow medical professionals to access a patient's medical history in case of an emergency. The VeriChip device is an ultra-small glass-encapsulated RFID tag (about the size of a grain of rice) that is injected beneath the skin. According to VeriChip, more than 2,000 people have had its RFID tag implanted. <br/><br/>VeriChip Corporation, which went public in February of this year, addressed how unresolved privacy issues could impact its business in its February 9, 2007, prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission: ""While we support all pending and enacted legislation that would preclude anything other than voluntary implantation, legislative bodies or government agencies may determine to go further, and their actions may have the effect, directly or indirectly, of delaying, limiting or preventing the use of human-implantable RFID microchips or the sale, manufacture or use of RFID systems utilizing such microchips."" <br/><br/>A December 2006 Department of Homeland Security privacy committee report noted that efficiencies from RFID-enabled identification documents are limited because staff still need some means of confirming that the document holders are who they say they are. This problem could be addressed with subdermal implantation of RFID devices. While subdermal RFID has some promise when used voluntarily, it comes with the same security and privacy risks associated with other RFID-enabled products. Because it is injected beneath the skin and is costly and challenging to remove safely, subdermal RFID presents a Pandora's Box of policy questions in addition to its implications for constitutionally protected rights to freedom and privacy. <br/><br/>Pending before the California legislature are several other bills, also introduced by Senator Simitian, that are aimed at addressing privacy concerns of RFID use in school identification documents, driver's licenses and similar personal documents.</p>

This device is  designed to track a person while in the privacy of thier private life. I have been threatned to either hand over my inventions or I will be killed for them, ""truth"".
   Well I am telling the truth and have more evidence then any other victim of this same crime. I am famous for speaking out against this crime and winning cases in court for this same crime. If one is to just google my name they can find my cases online. I have been published in many magazines as well as newspapers sold around the world. The most recent coverage of my case is printed in over 35,000 copies being sold on the newstand of Fortean Time issue number 243 2011. Just to check the validity of my claims to you, please do read this article to confirm. It's legit!  http://www.forteantimes.com/features/fbi/5383/a_game_of_tag.html   
  This is real and its expensive to get removed! I have been pumping out thousands to just protect my inventions as well as my family from this crime. As, you will see in the video as well as this article above, I am currently trying to stop this crime against myself and others. I have spoke out in Washignton DC against this crime and have also been the driving force for laws to be implemented against this same crime that I am a victim of. So, Please take the time to go over these House Bill's as well as the Senate Bill's too to validate the concern, as well as what I am speaking of.As, to the truth!

Now Harel needs special testing and treatment in the United States, but does not have enough money to pay for it. <br/> Two and a half years ago was when the family discovered that Harel had a rare cancer, called Neuroblastoma. Slowly the tumor has spread to bones throughout the body and most recently the skull and chest. He received numerous chemotherapy, radiotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, and German experimental treatment that did not help. He had a bone marrow transplant, and harsh treatments, but the disease continued to strike.<br/> His father and mother find it difficult to finance Harel's treatments alone putting the entire family through severe economic hardship. The father was forced to quit his job to bring Harel to the US. The working mother also takes care of the couple’s 2 year old daughter and is 9 months pregnant with their third child. <br/> As a result of tests conducted, it was discovered that Harel’s body has become resistant to standard chemotherapy. The only chance to save Harel is with an experimental treatment performed at Children's Hospital Of Philadelphia. The cost plus payments for tests and stay, could reach $600,000 - an amount that the HMO is not going to pay and his parents cannot afford. $300,000 has been raised so far in order for Harel to start treatment and cover all expenses, but $300,000 is still needed.<br/> Harel and his father arrived last week but unfortunately Harel’s mother was unable to make the journey as she is due any day. A local Cherry Hill, NJ family has selflessly opened up their home to Harel and his father during the three-month trial. G-d willing if Harel’s body responds well to the treatment, the family will be spending a year here.<br/> Any donation big or small will help save Harel’s life. Harel needs your help. </p>
<p><br/> Please contact Danielle Schwartz (609-674-1461 or dani.kimchi@gmail.com) if you are interested in helping Harel.</p>
<div>הראל יוסף דבוש, רק בן 5 וכבר הספיק לעבור את מחצית חייו בבתי חולים. בגיל שנתיים וחצי לקה הראל בסרטן נדיר מאוד מסוג נוירובלסטמה. </div>
<div>מאז גילוי המחלה עבר הראל טיפוליים כימותרפיים, השתלת מוח עצם, ניתוח להסרת גידולים אותם ניתן היה להסיר וגם טיפול ניסיוני בגרמניה שגם לא עזר.</div>
<div>הרופאים בבית החולים שניידר שבפתח תקווה המליצו להוריו של הראל להטיסו לפילדלפיה, לבית החולים לילדים Chop, שם ניתן טיפול ייחודי וראשון מסוגו בעולם לזן נדיר זה של המחלה. טיפול זה הוא הסיכוי היחיד להצלת חייו של הראל דבוש. עלות הטיפול נאמדת בכ-400 אלף דולרים, סכום אותו המשפחה לא יכולה להשיג.</div>
<div>העיר באר- שבע, בה מתגוררים המשפחה, לקחה את הראל הקטן תחת חסותה וקיימה לאחרונה ערב התרמה מיוחד בהשתתפות אמנים רבים: אייל שני, צביקה הדר, שלום אסייג, הראל מויאל, רוני דלומי ועוד. בערב זה גויס סכום של כ-300 אלף דולרים אך עדיין חסרים יותר מ-100 אלף דולרים להשלמת התהליך.</div>
<div>חייהם של בני המשפחה השתנו לחלוטין בעקבות מחלתו של הראל. האם, אביגיל, הנמצאת כעת בחודש התשיעי להריון, עובדת בשירות בתי הסוהר. בעלה שי, עובד בלילות כנהג משאית. וכך במשך הימים בהם היה הראל בטיפולים חילקו בני הזוג משמרות בניהם, האב בבקרים והאם אחרי הצהריים. להראל יש אחות נוספת, ליאור, בת השנתיים.</div>

</div></div>","Harel Dabush, from Beer Sheva is only 5 years old and is faced with a life-threatening rare cancer. Now Harel needs special testing and treatment in the United States, but does not have enough money to pay for it.  Two and a half years ago was when the family discovered that Harel had a rare cancer, called Neuroblastoma. Slowly the tumor has spread to bones throughout the body and most recently the skull and chest. He received numerous chemotherapy, radiotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, and German experimental treatment that did not help. He had a bone marrow transplant, and harsh treatments, but the disease continued to strike. His father and mother find it difficult to finance Harel's treatments alone putting the entire family through severe economic hardship. The father was forced to quit his job to bring Harel to the US. The working mother also takes care of the couple’s 2 year old daughter and is 9 months pregnant with their third child.  As a result of tests conducted, it was discovered that Harel’s body has become resistant to standard chemotherapy. The only chance to save Harel is with an experimental treatment performed at Children's Hospital Of Philadelphia. The cost plus payments for tests and stay, could reach $600,000 - an amount that the HMO is not going to pay and his parents cannot afford. $300,000 has been raised so far in order for Harel to start treatment and cover all expenses, but $300,000 is still needed. Harel and his father arrived last week but unfortunately Harel’s mother was unable to make the journey as she is due any day. A local Cherry Hill, NJ family has selflessly opened up their home to Harel and his father during the three-month trial. G-d willing if Harel’s body responds well to the treatment, the family will be spending a year here. Any donation big or small will help save Harel’s life. Harel needs your help. 
 Please contact Danielle Schwartz (609-674-1461 or dani.kimchi@gmail.com) if you are interested in helping Harel.
הראל יוסף דבוש, רק בן 5 וכבר הספיק לעבור את מחצית חייו בבתי חולים. בגיל שנתיים וחצי לקה הראל בסרטן נדיר מאוד מסוג נוירובלסטמה. 
מאז גילוי המחלה עבר הראל טיפוליים כימותרפיים, השתלת מוח עצם, ניתוח להסרת גידולים אותם ניתן היה להסיר וגם טיפול ניסיוני בגרמניה שגם לא עזר.
הרופאים בבית החולים שניידר שבפתח תקווה המליצו להוריו של הראל להטיסו לפילדלפיה, לבית החולים לילדים Chop, שם ניתן טיפול ייחודי וראשון מסוגו בעולם לזן נדיר זה של המחלה. טיפול זה הוא הסיכוי היחיד להצלת חייו של הראל דבוש. עלות הטיפול נאמדת בכ-400 אלף דולרים, סכום אותו המשפחה לא יכולה להשיג.
העיר באר- שבע, בה מתגוררים המשפחה, לקחה את הראל הקטן תחת חסותה וקיימה לאחרונה ערב התרמה מיוחד בהשתתפות אמנים רבים: אייל שני, צביקה הדר, שלום אסייג, הראל מויאל, רוני דלומי ועוד. בערב זה גויס סכום של כ-300 אלף דולרים אך עדיין חסרים יותר מ-100 אלף דולרים להשלמת התהליך.
חייהם של בני המשפחה השתנו לחלוטין בעקבות מחלתו של הראל. האם, אביגיל, הנמצאת כעת בחודש התשיעי להריון, עובדת בשירות בתי הסוהר. בעלה שי, עובד בלילות כנהג משאית. וכך במשך הימים בהם היה הראל בטיפולים חילקו בני הזוג משמרות בניהם, האב בבקרים והאם אחרי הצהריים. להראל יש אחות נוספת, ליאור, בת השנתיים.
הראל הגיע לארה""ב יחד עם אביו שי ב-12 לפברואר. וכעת הם מתגוררים אצל משפחה ישראלית בצ'רי- היל, ניו ג'רזי.  
הראל ואביו ישהו אצל המשפחה המארחת למשך כשלושה חודשים לתקופה הראשונה. במידה והראל יגיב לטיפולים באופן חיובי, הם ישארו בארה""ב להמשך הטיפולים שיארכו כשנה.
האם אביגל אמרה כי היא מתכוונת לטוס מייד לאחר הלידה יחד עם ביתה והתינוק, לארה""ב ולהצטרף להראל ולשי בעלה.
האב שי מספר כי ""הראל הוא ילד רגיל כמו כולם אך הילדות נלקחה ממנו, הראל מודע לעצם היותו חולה, לצערנו המשחקים שהוא מכיר זה רופא וחולה והצעצועים שלו הם התרופות""
עוד הוסיף האב שלאחרונה הראל התחיל להתפלל והוא מבקש בלילה במיטה מבורא עולם להיות בריא!
בימים אלה המשפחה עדיין מגייסת כסף עבור הטיפולים היקרים אותם התחיל כאמור בבית החולים לילדים בפילדלפיה. טיפולים העשויים להציל את חייו ולהגשים את חלומותיו: להכיר את אחיו שבבטן אימו, ללמוד כמו כולם בכיתה א' בשנה הבאה וכמובן- לחיות!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>On August 17th, 2011 Katie McCall, a CA licensed midwife, was convicted of practicing medicine without a license for a 2007 birth she assisted as a midwifery student. She was arrested, charged, tried and convicted while holding her medical license in good standing and while having no complaints issued against her as a licensed professional. She has never lost a baby or harmed anyone while serving the over 1,000 birthing families she has served in midwifery care and education over the past ten years. She has never had a complaint filed by a family she has cared for. <br/> <br/>Her criminal charge arose from a home birth where her supervising midwife could not arrive because she was at another birth. Instead of leaving the family to birth unassisted, Katie stayed.  She recommended that the family transfer to the hospital and the family refused.  They were aware that she was only a student midwife and that she was unable to secure an overseeing midwife. The original complaint was made by a bystander and not by the family who chose to birth at home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the mother began to push, the baby got stuck in a condition called shoulder dystocia.  Using her training as a student, Katie performed the Gaskin maneuver to free the baby.  The maneuver was successful, however, the mother began to hemorrhage due to a partially retained placenta.  Again, using her training, Katie was able to stop the bleeding and protect the mother from harm.  She went on to get her license and was later arrested from her licensed midwife office and taken to jail. At trial, Katie argued through counsel that her practicing medicine was justified due to the emergency situations above. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In most every state that recognizes out of hospital midwifery, Katie would not have been charged for refusing to abandon a woman who was birthing that refused a transport. But the state of California's legislation makes something as simple as palpating a pregnant belly or taking a blood pressure a felony.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Despite expert testimony from the Assistant Director of the Emergency Department at UCLA-Santa Monica and a renowned OB/GYN that Katie’s actions potentially saved two lives, a jury convicted her of one felony count of practicing medicine without a license at trial. Hundreds of letters were written in defense of Katie and the judge remarked that he had never seen so many people show support to a convicted criminal in his court room.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>On September 16, 2011, despite the fact that Katie has no prior criminal record of any sort, the judge upheld the felony conviction and sentenced Katie to 3 years probation and told her she cannot work as a midwife during that time. She was not given any time in prison or jail, but was instead given 280 hours of community service and $10,000 in restitution to the CA Medical Board, which was down from the $45,000 they were asking for to reimburse them for their investigation costs. This amount shocked even the judge, especially since the one birth was the only birth Katie was being tried for and the state of California is in such dire economic straits. Katie is unable to work in her profession during probation and the medical board will revoke her license as a result of the conviction. This is causing untold financial hardship on Katie, a single mother, and her two children, Christiana and Robert. She may never be allowed to be a midwife in CA again. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would like to see Katie able to serve families by doing what she loves once again. She is currently cleaning toilets at a shelter on Skid Row for her community service. As one of her supporters, Colby Scott, recently said, ""I think she served the community much better as a midwife."" In order for Katie to be able to move out of the state of California and be able to practice in a more midwifery friendly area, she must first be off probation since one of her probation requirements is that she not work as a midwife. In order to get off of probation, she needs to raise $10,000 to pay the Medical Board's restitution while simultaneously losing her job. So far, Katie's supporters have selflessly raised $4,000! This leaves $6,000 left to raise. </p>

<p><strong><em>When I first met Leanne, it did not take me long to realize she was someone very special. She is very kind and tender-hearted and genuinely cares about people. She has donated her time in the past to help raise funds to benefit cancer victims and is constantly thinking of others. She is a selfless person and what brings her the most joy is doing kind and considerate things for others. She has shown her compassion for others over and over again. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Please help to cover Cobra medical coverage. Medical coverage for 12 months is $5,616 ($468/month). Leanne suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis, a chronic autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks itself. In RA, the immune system – which is designed to protect our health by attacking foreign cells such as viruses and bacteria – instead attacks the body’s own tissues, specifically the joints. Left untreated, RA can cause deformity and disability, in addition to extreme pain and discomfort. She also suffers from migraine headaches and an under-active thyroid. Leanne has always put others before herself and has a heart of gold. She volunteered for the American Red Cross and spent weeks in Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina to assist in the recovery and rebuilding efforts.  Recently, she has endured some very difficult times. She is not working currently and is uninsured at this time. She takes over ten different prescription medications daily to control her disease and help reduce the pain/inflammation that her RA causes, in addition to other medical conditions. She has undergone several medical procedures, including sinus surgery, multiple EGD’s for gastrointestinal disorders, trips to the ER for debilitating migraine headaches and struggles with frequent infections.  She must see a specialist and undergo lab testing on a regular basis for Rheumatoid Arthritis. Her immune system is weak and she is susceptible to frequent infections and illnesses. Due to her condition, Leanne has difficulty performing some simple tasks that most of us take for granted. This campaign is my effort to give something back in appreciation for all that she has done for others. She is certainly deserving and she is sincerely grateful for anything you can do to help.</em></strong></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>ANY AMOUNT COUNTS!! EVERY DOLLAR IS APPRECIATED!!</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We are seeking compassionate and caring people to donate funds to help with immediate expenses. Any monetary amount, no matter how large or small, is greatly appreciated.  It is imperative that she maintains daily treatment for her disease to prevent further joint damage and destruction. She is being forced to move from her home where she has resided for 13 years due to her current financial situation. Pease look into your hearts and support this campaign to help give Leanne the quality of life she deserves and the medical attention she needs.  </em></strong></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong><em>The funds raised will go directly towards Leanne's immediate needs for medical care and medication. Leanne has always taken pride in taking care of herself and her financial responsibilities. Due to circumstances beyond her control, she is facing harder times ahead and really needs help from those in better circumstances. Your help will also bring her peace of mind as she spends a lot of time worrying and is uncertain of the future.  We are so grateful for this funding platform and greatly appreciative of any help you can offer! Please consider Paying it Forward for a very worthy cause. </em></strong></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><strong><em>Please spread the word about this campaign! We ask that you share with your family, friends and link this story on your Facebook or Twitter pages. At this time, there is no cure for RA. It's important that people become educated and informed about this disease. It is estimated that 1.5 million people in the US suffer from Rheumatoid Arthritis. If you are unable to donate at this time, please stop and say a prayer for Leanne and PLEASE consider sharing this information with everyone you know.  </em></strong></p>

In RA, the immune system – which is designed to protect our health by attacking foreign cells such as viruses and bacteria – instead attacks the body’s own tissues, specifically the joints. Left untreated, RA can cause deformity and disability, in addition to extreme pain and discomfort. She also suffers from migraine headaches and an under-active thyroid. Leanne has always put others before herself and has a heart of gold. She volunteered for the American Red Cross and spent weeks in Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina to assist in the recovery and rebuilding efforts.  Recently, she has endured some very difficult times. She is not working currently and is uninsured at this time. She takes over ten different prescription medications daily to control her disease and help reduce the pain/inflammation that her RA causes, in addition to other medical conditions. She has undergone several medical procedures, including sinus surgery, multiple EGD’s for gastrointestinal disorders, trips to the ER for debilitating migraine headaches and struggles with frequent infections.  She must see a specialist and undergo lab testing on a regular basis for Rheumatoid Arthritis. Her immune system is weak and she is susceptible to frequent infections and illnesses. Due to her condition, Leanne has difficulty performing some simple tasks that most of us take for granted. This campaign is my effort to give something back in appreciation for all that she has done for others. She is certainly deserving and she is sincerely grateful for anything you can do to help.
What We Need & What You Get
ANY AMOUNT COUNTS!! EVERY DOLLAR IS APPRECIATED!!
We are seeking compassionate and caring people to donate funds to help with immediate expenses. Any monetary amount, no matter how large or small, is greatly appreciated.  It is imperative that she maintains daily treatment for her disease to prevent further joint damage and destruction. She is being forced to move from her home where she has resided for 13 years due to her current financial situation. Pease look into your hearts and support this campaign to help give Leanne the quality of life she deserves and the medical attention she needs.  
The Impact
The funds raised will go directly towards Leanne's immediate needs for medical care and medication. Leanne has always taken pride in taking care of herself and her financial responsibilities. Due to circumstances beyond her control, she is facing harder times ahead and really needs help from those in better circumstances. Your help will also bring her peace of mind as she spends a lot of time worrying and is uncertain of the future.  We are so grateful for this funding platform and greatly appreciative of any help you can offer! Please consider Paying it Forward for a very worthy cause. 
Other Ways You Can Help
Please spread the word about this campaign! We ask that you share with your family, friends and link this story on your Facebook or Twitter pages. At this time, there is no cure for RA. It's important that people become educated and informed about this disease. It is estimated that 1.5 million people in the US suffer from Rheumatoid Arthritis. If you are unable to donate at this time, please stop and say a prayer for Leanne and PLEASE consider sharing this information with everyone you know.  
For questions about this campaign, please email: Michic40@gmail.com 
Note: We hope to raise at least $3,000 so that Leanne can keep 96% of campaign funds but we hope to raise more. Thank-you for your kindness, compassion and helping to make a difference in one persons life!

Why Bump Water?



Because healthy babies start with healthy women.
With Bump Water, we have the supplement you need—and a great tasting refreshing beverage all in one slim bottle.
The star of prenatals is folic acid—it is essential to the healthy development of children, before (all women of child bearing age should be taking folic acid) and during pregnancy (it dramatically decreases the incidence of neural tube defects) and while breastfeeding. Plus, recent studies are finding there may be a link between folic acid deficiency in mothers and autism.

<h2>The Story of Stefanos:</h2>
<p>Please view the video with care and understanding of my son's character. Stefanos' PANDAS/PANS condition is not typical of all PANDAS/PANS cases. And yet another reason why we are reaching out.</p>
<p><br/>Stefanos, our son, is a fifteen year old boy who was diagnosed with PANDAS-like (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuro-psych Disorder Associated with Streptococcus) syndrome when he was twelve. Prior to his diagnosis, he was a perfectly normal kid in every way. He was an honors student with a talent in computer programming who was outgoing, funny, loving, and sweet. By Sept 2009, after a Streptococcus infection in June 2009 and a Coxsackie infection a month later, he could not add, read or write and was hallucinating on a daily basis.  He also was experiencing severe movement disorders.</p>
<p>Dr. Rosario Trifiletti, a specialized neurologist in Ramsey, New Jersey said Stefanos’ diagnosis was closest to PANDAS, but that this case was quite special.  He also looked into other forms of autoimmune encephalitis including anti NMDA receptor encephalitis</p>
<p>Although we tried every category of drugs for two years, Stefanos’ hallucinations, movement disorders, anxiety and OCD worsened.  His hallucinations became more violent and terrifying. He heard voices telling him to kill himself. Some days Stefanos could not even walk because his brain could not find his legs.  Some days he could not speak and some days his head would be tilted and attached to his shoulder while his arms waved around uncontrollably. One time Stefanos did not know who he was or where he was, total amnesia, yet he recuperated. We began to call these drastic events episodes. Yet, those years, Stefanos still persevered and went to school and kept his friends.</p>
<p>February 2012, Stefanos started saying nasty things.  He would speak about every horror movie ever made.  His life revolved around darkness for at least fifteen hours of the day.  He exhibited non-stop talking and pacing.  I turned to Father Eugene Pappas in the Three Hierarchs Greek Orthodox Church of Brooklyn.  He nurtured Stefanos every week and also assisted in another small miracle.</p>
<p>Through all of Stefanos’ mental changes in February 2012, I noticed his movement disorders mysteriously disappearing.  His coordination was coming back.  He still could not add but was beginning to read and write again.  Although he was making progress, he still could not focus for more than ten seconds.</p>
<p>Currently, because of brain swelling, Stefanos cannot be alone since he is in his own world most times and speaks about things only I understand from his childhood or computer talk or TV/movies. He can and has easily run into traffic. He does not want to see his friends because of his affliction. As a child he knows he is different now and as a mother this only breaks my heart even further.  Stefanos is aware of what is going on and at times tells me, ""Mommy, I am petrified."" I know he is, but currently I cannot stop this progression.</p>
<p>Our days are like rollercoasters. But to look at the bright side, Melina, my daughter, is slowly moving back into the house. My parents, who raised Stefanos while I was working, are learning to deal. Because of recent positive interventions from our church, family and friends, Stefanos is now pleasant, smiling and laughing. My husband got the appropriate help and is learning how to deal with Stefanos’ situation and is contributing to Stefanos' treatment.  Although Stefanos’ symptoms are slightly better compared to February, he still has an autoimmune disease that destroys cognitive skills, and motor skills. What else can a kid endure and keep smiling? He is quite amazing.</p>
<p>There are a few important reasons why I am sharing my story and asking for needed donations. After a twenty-five year career as a video editor, I am not working. We have been financially devastated because of Stefanos’s illness. <strong>Medical bills are drastically piling up.  We can not make ends meet. </strong><strong><strong> Monies collected from this site will go towards monthly bills and Stefanos and his care. </strong>In order for Stefanos and many kids like him to get better, further monies for research will be needed and monies will go towards Dr</strong><strong>. Chugani's  PET scan research, Dr. T's genetic research and Dr. Cunningham's PANDA blood tests.  I am disappointed to find that no major corporation as of yet will fund any medical research that a simple antibiotic or antiviral can cure, if caught in time.  And lastly, I ask for financial support for materials for presentations at schools, hospitals, doctor's offices and religious institutions, to educate the community through the Story of Stefanos.  The pdfs in the Gallery section have great info on how to recognize <strong>PANDAS/PANS </strong> in the early stages and come from another wonderful website, </strong><a href=""http://www.pandasnetwork.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>www.pandasnetwork.org</strong></a><strong> </strong> <strong>Some exciting news is that the A&amp;E channel has interviewed me and Dr. T for their new series.  The Staten Island Advance newspaper has also been notified.  And due to a wonderful person at our church, we now have this indiegogo campaign. Please also keep your eye out on the web for the latest info discussed at the Irvine CA conference on PANDAS/PANS (Sept. 24, 25 2012)  <br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>A Sisters Love:</strong></h3>
<p>My daughter, Melina is amazing at age twelve.  Unfortunately she has had to mature overnight.  Her art talent has blossomed in the past three months. Her work was even displayed at the New York Art Club in Gramercy Park. A wonderful woman, Laura Brunetti, from her organization called, ""The Caring Canvas"", helps families in need and was able to assist Melina. Recently, we made a Facebook page for Melina's art called, ""Melina Loves Art for Stefanos."" If you are interested you can see more of Melina’s work there.</p>
<h3><strong>We Need Your Help for Stefanos:</strong></h3>
<p>In closing, I need this story to go viral. There are 400 families with anti NMDA receptor encephalitis on Facebook. Their horror stories are quite the same or worse. There are over 1000 families with documented PANDAS/PANS cases on pandasnetwork.org 's database. We need to educate doctors to stop and think  PANDAS/PANS/autoimmune encephalitis before mental illness in children (and that means OCD as well). Misdiagnosed encephalitis causes life long complications. We need to learn more about both NMDA and PANDAS so kids are not placed on the wrong drugs. Believe it or not a prescription of appropriate antibiotics or antiviral at the time of a child’s onset may take PANDAS/PANS children off Zoloft or OCD meds, just maybe!!!? We need to stop our medical system and its politics and set up embraced protocols for these diseases.  When we break a finger, we get an X-ray before doctors treat the condition. When we have a mental status change, no matter what age it seems, many times doctors prescribe non-effective psych drugs. Think about this…Did we ever give our autistic kids PET scans? In my opinion, children demonstrating Autism/PANDAS/PANS/NMDA encephalitis symptoms must be given a PET scan before psych drugs are prescribed to them. Ironically enough, in our case psych hospitals refused to give antibiotics and the medical hospitals refused antibiotic treatment because doctors felt Stefanos was a psych patient. Medical or not it is so sad that there is a separation of these two types of hospitals in America today. Must I go on?</p>
<p><span style=""color: black; font-family: arial; font-size: small;""><span class=""style86""><span><span style=""color: black; font-family: arial;"">Stefanos and my family are finally asking for help after a four-year struggle.  PANDAS/PANS does exist and research must continue with our help. We gratefully appreciate your support. I know, with all your prayers and love, we can educate the world about PANDAS/PANS. Thank you.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>We are a group of International Rescue and Relief students from Union College who are traveling to Nicaragua for the Spring Semester of 2013. While there we will be conducting some informative classes on a few very important issues affecting the indigenous Nicaraguan people. One of these issues is the topic of Malaria. We are attempting to raise a small amount of money in order to purchase some much needed mosquito nets. These nets will be handed out at each of the classes. Because the Miskito people of Nicaragua rarely receive a quality education, there are many basic health ideas which they do not yet understand. We are hoping to raise awareness about Malaria so that we can not only help treat the symptoms of Malaria, but prevent it as well. We are extremely excited about this project and hope you will be as well!</p>
</div>

<p>Any way you choose to support this cause would be greatly appreciated! If you would prefer to donate mosquito nets directly to Union College feel free to email us and we will give you our contact information. Also, any publicity we receive will be very helpful.

We are expecting a little one on March 10th, 2014! We have a wonderful midwife, and we are planning a home birth in Nashville, TN. Due to our high-deductible insurance plan and the nature of insurance coverage for midwifery care in this area, we will be paying for our prenatal, birth, and postpartum care out-of-pocket. We're asking for your loving support to help us manifest this dream! We are blessed to be experiencing this miracle of life in our family, and we are ecstatic to be sharing it with you!How You Can Help
Our goal is to raise $4,000, which will go directly towards supporting our growing family through this journey. This money will cover all the costs of our prenatal care, birth, and postpartum care, including newborn exams. It will also cover childbirth classes, labs, and ultrasounds. Even if we do not reach our goal, any donations we receive will still be used to pay for as much of these expenses as possible! Your contributions will help us welcome our baby into this world the way we dream! They will also relieve us of some financial stress such a major life event presents for us at this time and allow us to focus more on what really matters - our family and our new baby! We are infinitely grateful for your support, and we're so excited to share our pregnancy and birth experience with you!

Other Ways You Can Help

Inviting: Our healing garden will be a
bright and glorious sign of welcome for all who enter, inviting resting in,

Contemplative: The plantings and other
natural features will awaken the senses of sight, smell and touch, creating an

Opened in 1990 in response to the lack of safe, stable housing for poor men with AIDS in Washington, DC, Joseph’s House today offers a welcoming community and comprehensive nursing and support services to homeless men and women with late-stage and end-stage AIDS and terminal cancer.

Together, we nurture the living and accompany the dying, providing a depth of physical, emotional and spiritual support that creates the possibility for profound healing and the restoration of individual dignity.

Help us Build the Terrace of Remembrance 



 
The garden's cornerstone will be the Terrace of Remembrance. Located where we have long held an annual memorial service for residents, the beautifully designed Terrace of Remembrance will recall the spirits of the hundreds of men and women who have lived, loved and died among us these past twenty five years and also be a special place for a few, or for many, to gather for conversation, music, memorial services, and other events to heal and renew the spirit.

The terrace will feature natural stone paving, a specially designed remembrance wall, and a rough stone altar –  elements that will make the Terrace of Remembrance a place of meaning and comfort.

Your support will also help to fill the space with the names of those we remember and those who support our mission of justice and compassion.

Our long-held dream for a healing garden took a huge step forward in spring 2014 when we won MakeDC's citywide design competition Designing Dreams. Working with MakeDC, we have refined our vision for the garden. Creating a fully accessible garden is a bigger challenge than we anticipated.

<b><i>Why Mental Health?....Because
UMATTER</i></b>
<p>There is not one person who has not
been impacted by mental health challenges, directly or indirectly. It 
does not matter if you are rich or poor; black, white, red, yellow, or 
brown, mental health affects us all. Just read the headlines...from over
 900 deaths from mass shootings in the last 7 years to an  alarming 
number of suicides by celebrities and popular religious leaders 
including Robin Williams, Don Cornelius, Lee Thompson Young, and Pastor 
Teddy Parker. These are only a few names that have made national news. 
Think about the countless number of people who we know and love that 
suffer from mental health challenges but never make the headlines. </p>
<p>You or a loved one may have
experienced overwhelming stress, anxiety, depression, or a more serious 
mental
health issue. I am Dr. Sherry and like many of you, I grew up in a 
community where mental health was and still is a topic that you do not 
dare talk about openly. People tend to ignore mental health problems 
because they are often embarrassed or ashamed to deal with them. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<b><em>UMATTER Campaign<br/><br/></em></b>
<p>Stigma is the number one reason why many people,
especially African Americans, do not talk about mental health challenges or seek help. It
is time to change that! Stigma is something that can be changed because it all
starts in the mind. The
Edge Empowerment Foundation and myself are excited to launch UMATTER, a
national campaign to reduce mental health stigma and increase awareness while
promoting mental health wellness. UMATTER (<u><strong>U</strong></u>nderstanding <u><strong>M</strong></u>ental
Health <u><strong>A</strong></u>wareness <u><strong>T</strong></u>hrough <u><strong>T</strong></u>echnology, <u><strong>E</strong></u>ducation, and
<u><strong>R</strong></u>esearch) is an innovative program where you can interact and hear
celebrities share their stories about mental health challenges as well as enjoy
music and other forms of entertainment. Multiple events are planned that will
be exciting, interactive, informative, and empowering.</p>
<p><b><em>The Need</em></b></p>
<p>The need for UMATTER is great! Stigma is
embedded and perpetuated through family and friends, churches and other faith
based communities, cultural stereotypes, and media reports. We are our
brother's keeper and it is our goal to reduce the stigma of mental health by
creating platforms for everyday people. Combating mental health stigma is our
number one priority. We need your help in donations, sponsorships, and in-kind
services. Join us and make a difference in someone's life.</p>

<p><b><em>Testimonial........</em></b></p>
<p>I was diagnosed with Kidney Cancer in
2013, and I went through the process as if it was a piece of cake. Never
realizing that my entire life was altered with one diagnosis. I went through a
Radical Nephrectomy losing my left kidney. Openly, I wore a mask pretending that
life was amazing and secretly, I was a wreck, lost for words and I didn't know
how to feel and I did not have anyone to express my feelings to. I was
spiraling downward and I was literally depressed. I started seeing Dr. Sherry and

</div><br/></div>","Why Mental Health?....Because
UMATTER
There is not one person who has not
been impacted by mental health challenges, directly or indirectly. It 
does not matter if you are rich or poor; black, white, red, yellow, or 
brown, mental health affects us all. Just read the headlines...from over
 900 deaths from mass shootings in the last 7 years to an  alarming 
number of suicides by celebrities and popular religious leaders 
including Robin Williams, Don Cornelius, Lee Thompson Young, and Pastor 
Teddy Parker. These are only a few names that have made national news. 
Think about the countless number of people who we know and love that 
suffer from mental health challenges but never make the headlines. 
You or a loved one may have
experienced overwhelming stress, anxiety, depression, or a more serious 
mental
health issue. I am Dr. Sherry and like many of you, I grew up in a 
community where mental health was and still is a topic that you do not 
dare talk about openly. People tend to ignore mental health problems 
because they are often embarrassed or ashamed to deal with them. 



UMATTER Campaign
Stigma is the number one reason why many people,
especially African Americans, do not talk about mental health challenges or seek help. It
is time to change that! Stigma is something that can be changed because it all
starts in the mind. The
Edge Empowerment Foundation and myself are excited to launch UMATTER, a
national campaign to reduce mental health stigma and increase awareness while
promoting mental health wellness. UMATTER (Understanding Mental
Health Awareness Through Technology, Education, and
Research) is an innovative program where you can interact and hear
celebrities share their stories about mental health challenges as well as enjoy
music and other forms of entertainment. Multiple events are planned that will
be exciting, interactive, informative, and empowering.
The Need
The need for UMATTER is great! Stigma is
embedded and perpetuated through family and friends, churches and other faith
based communities, cultural stereotypes, and media reports. We are our
brother's keeper and it is our goal to reduce the stigma of mental health by
creating platforms for everyday people. Combating mental health stigma is our
number one priority. We need your help in donations, sponsorships, and in-kind
services. Join us and make a difference in someone's life.



Testimonial........
I was diagnosed with Kidney Cancer in
2013, and I went through the process as if it was a piece of cake. Never
realizing that my entire life was altered with one diagnosis. I went through a
Radical Nephrectomy losing my left kidney. Openly, I wore a mask pretending that
life was amazing and secretly, I was a wreck, lost for words and I didn't know
how to feel and I did not have anyone to express my feelings to. I was
spiraling downward and I was literally depressed. I started seeing Dr. Sherry and
I found a safe haven, I was able to say the things to her that I could not say
to anyone else. I found myself getting stronger; I could say the word cancer
without wanting to jump off a cliff. She took me through the process of healing
step by step, she never judged me, and she willed me back. It is because of her,
I am back and now preparing to speak to those worldwide about life after kidney
cancer. All I can say is she is the best thing that has ever happened to me………

We've raised significant cash from our own resources but need a further £500 - £1000, to complete the funding syndicate. 




BUT ... 
... our goals through crowdfunding is not just the cash alone; we want people to get this product into care and residential homes and get them used. The more people are aware these exist, the better life becomes for those who use them - every little bit helps.







The simplest way, of course is to buy one or a set for 'mum or dad', someone you know, or perhaps you have a local home, hospice, memory cafe or community centre, you might like to support. If anyone wants to support the idea by donation, we guarantee we will donate the equivalent number of 'Platzmats' to suitable homes or charities.   Every part of this fund will go towards providing 'Platzmats' for 
people with dementia - there are no overheads included in these 
costings - its all about getting the product out there.

We are thoroughly committed to this project so if we don't raise the cash then the project will take much longer, and we'll miss the Christmas window of opportunity. 
What it means
Feedback from around the world is extremely positive seeing it as a  very simple
lo-tech solution offering real benefits for keeping people’s minds active. 
It takes no
training or understanding; it gives all the information required; it gets
people involved, it give people self-worth, and at the end of their day,
they can congratulate themselves and feel fulfilled to some extent, that
they’ve been part of a community; allowing them to continue their lives with
this difficult condition with a level of dignity, engagement and happiness.
We can do it!




We're a small engineering design company who have developed several 
products for dementia. We have a good track record of identifying needs,
 designing the product to suit those needs, and then getting it to 
manufacture. 
   













The technology has been surprisingly challenging from material selection and
advanced printing technologies, but designing and developing product is what we do; and we've done all the hard work in getting this right.We’re now ready to launch.






If you are involved with dementia then you may know some of our other products already out there. Checkout our

Risks & Challenges After 8 months development of materials, processing and testing, the technical challenges have been resolved. We need to commission the final production and get it to our distribution network (and finding new ones).
To maximise our marketing push, during November we're attending MEDICA, Europes largest medical exhibition in Germany, and we'll be at the OT show in the NEC, in Birmingham, UK.
We want the product to be available in early December, which we can achieve if we get the funds.

<p><b>Two of the biggest problems facing parents with teenaged kids today are: Underage drinking and prescription drug abuse. The Bottle Blocker helps you prevent both these problems in your home, the only place where you have any control.</b></p>
<p>My name is Richard Michiel, and I am the inventor of the Bottle Blocker. The Bottle Blocker is a patent-pending tamper proof locking device that fits on any liquor bottle or pill bottle to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<p>The product was created in response to the staggering numbers of injuries and deaths that occur each year as a result of underage drinking. Alcohol is the most commonly used and abused drug among youth in the United States, more than tobacco and illicit drugs, and is responsible for more than 4,700 annual deaths among youth. Although drinking by persons under the age of 21 is illegal, people aged 12 to 20 years drink 11% of all alcohol consumed in the United States. In 2010, there were approximately 189,000 emergency rooms visits by persons under age 21 for injuries and other conditions linked to alcohol. The 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that among high school students, during the past 30 days: 39% drank some amount of alcohol; 22% binge drank; and 8% drove after drinking alcohol.</p>
<p>“Most kids get their first taste of alcohol from their parent’s liquor cabinet,” says LICADD (Long Island Council on Alcohol and Drug Addiction) Executive Director Dr. Jeffrey L. Reynolds. “Parents who use Bottle Blocker will send a clear message to their kids that they won’t tolerate underage drinking and violation of the device will give them the opportunity to address alcohol abuse before it spirals into a more serious problem. With increased enforcement of social host laws and the advent of summer parties, parents need to act affirmatively to both protect their kids and limit their liability.”</p>
<p>The simple two-piece device fits on any bottle with a neck, first with a custom latex cap that covers the bottle cap, and is then secured with a custom cable tie. The ties come in a custom color with an imprinted logo to make them difficult to replace. The Bottle Blocker can also be used on pill bottles – ensuring that prescriptions are safe and out of children’s hands.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I am working on a New Improved version of the Bottle Blocker. As great as the response to the original Bottle Blocker was I am making it even better! By adding a different serial number on each tie that will make it impossible to replace without getting caught, and adding a log sheet that will track where each lock was used which will prevent a kid from taking an entire bottle we can save even more lives.</p>
<p>Once we get our new improved ties, we need to start an advertising campaign to get it out and do something to change the statistics facing our youth and hopefully save some lives. That’s where you come in, we need funds to start a campaign to make people aware that we are here to help, and that we can make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need and Why</strong></p>
<p>I am trying to raise $15,000 to start an advertising campaign to create some brand awareness and let people know that there is a better way to deal with this age-old problem than just talking to our kids.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong><br/></p>
<p>Help me make a difference. I know this product is important to parents as well as their kids. We can save some lives. We can change the statistics and show our kids in a very strong way that we want them to be safe, we want them to make better decisions, and we do not want them drinking our alcohol or taking our pills.</p>
<p>This is such a simple solution, yet no one has come up with anything like it before. Its inexpensive, simple to use, and with your help we will make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>OK, so you saw my campaign, you like the idea, see the value, but you just don't have the funds to help us in that way. I understand, there is still a way to help get this product out and it doesn't cost a penny. Spread the word, help me make people aware that we exist and that finally you can do more than just talk to your kids about underage drinking and prescription drug abuse at home. Tell your facebook friends, twitter connections and your local PTA about our campaign so that others can help us reach our goals.</p>

<h3>TeamJonny!</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Cami and I'm fundraising for my six year old cousin, Jonny. He was diagnosed with Pre-B Acute Lymphocyctic Leukemia on August 20th, 2013. This little boy is the light of my life. He's my everything. And while there isn't much I can do because this is not a ""boo-boo"" that I can kiss and make better, I can at least do this.</p>
<p>So I'm raising money to help my aunt and uncle (who have been like second parents to me) with whatever they need. We don't know yet how long he will be in and out of the hospital. We do know that treatments will continue for the next three years.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I need:</h3>
<p>Some more details:</p>
<ul>
<li>My goal is $1000 or more. It won't cover much, but it's still help. The money will go to my aunt and uncle.</li>

Hi! I'm Cami and I'm fundraising for my six year old cousin, Jonny. He was diagnosed with Pre-B Acute Lymphocyctic Leukemia on August 20th, 2013. This little boy is the light of my life. He's my everything. And while there isn't much I can do because this is not a ""boo-boo"" that I can kiss and make better, I can at least do this.
So I'm raising money to help my aunt and uncle (who have been like second parents to me) with whatever they need. We don't know yet how long he will be in and out of the hospital. We do know that treatments will continue for the next three years.


What I need:
Some more details:

My goal is $1000 or more. It won't cover much, but it's still help. The money will go to my aunt and uncle.
Whether it's $10 or $10,000, all donations will go to the Hendricks family.



The Impact
Your donations may not seem like much, but they're everything:


I feel helpless knowing that there's nothing I can do to make this better. But if I can do this one little thing, to take some stress off them, they'll be in better moods and Jonny will be in a better mood which is key to recovery.

I need him to beat this. My whole family does. He's a fighter in every sense of the word. I'm just trying to make the fight as easy as possible for him.



Other Ways You Can Help!
Even if you can't donate, there's still things you can do!

</p><p>
</p><p>Elise
Colleen Yates <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">is
a serious competitor, and her sport is bowling. As a 16 year old
sophomore, Elise has already accomplished a great deal. (A list of
some of her achievements is included below.) Her
determination and drive to win are evident to everyone who knows her,
and her skill and smooth game play are the results of thousands of
hours and several years of practice and hard work. Until now,
however, the only tournaments she has been able to participate in
have been local (Washington and Oregon) and have been paid for, out
of pocket, by us (her parents). For bowling, tournaments are where a
player makes their name and gets noticed. Unfortunately, we don't really have the income to afford for Elise to test her skills at any of the
larger national events, which would give her
better scholarship prizes, greater exposure to potential college
scouts, and competition experience.</span>
</p><p>
</p><p>Elise
has worked hard and is already a great bowler, but she is constantly
striving to improve her skill level and mental game, and in order for
her to reach the next level, she needs to be able to participate in
national competitions. We are asking for your help to get Elise to her first major tournament: the 2014
Bowling.com Youth Open, which takes place this June in Lakewood,
California. In order for her to compete, she's going to need your support!</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/398669/files/20140227110103-athlete_of_the_month.jpg?1393527663"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""/><br/></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>What You Can Do</h3><p></p><p>The
most important gift we can give is that which helps a child achieve
his or her dreams. Unfortunately, not all kids are able to pursue
their goals due to financial handicaps. While some do not have to
worry about paying for what they need to succeed, others have to reach out to the community for support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They
say that it takes a village to raise a child, and it is this village that we are asking to help Elise be able to travel to a very important tournament for her
career. Any amount that you can donate is greatly
appreciated, and by supporting this young athlete, we can take great
pride in her future accomplishments!<br/><br/></p><h3><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The

</p><p>
</p><p>The
Youth Open is a USBC certified tournament, and Elise will bowl in the
singles and doubles divisions. The tournament is in Lakewood, CA, and
takes place June 21 and 22, 2014. Travel expenses (transportation, hotel, food)<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> and
entry fees come to approximately $2,890.00, (which is definitely more
than an optician and an writing instructor can afford to pay.)
However, as Elise plans to continue her bowling career into college,
the potential scholarship awards, the exposure to college scouts, and
the experience of bowling in a fiercely competitive environment are
essential elements of achieving her goal.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The
funds raised by this campaign will go towards covering travel expenses and entry fees (for Elise and her doubles
partner.) We are NOT including time off of work in the proposed
amount, only the expenses directly related to tournament
participation. Any additional funds that we raise will go towards
other tournaments, coaching costs, and equipment expenses, and
believe me, as much as this girl bowls, maintaining her gear can get
expensive!<br/><br/></p>
<p>
</p><h3>The
Perks</h3>
<p>
</p><p>What
will you get for donating? The most important thing you will get for
donating to Elise's campaign is the knowledge that you have helped a
young athlete to reach her fullest potential. BUT! As we are living
in a material world (and you may or may not be a material girl) we
realize that fancy, additional perks may help sweeten the pot!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For
$5 or more, your name will be added to the list of supporters at the
""Help Elise Yates to Compete"" Facebook page, and you will
also receive profuse amounts of positive energy and psychic thanks
from her entire support team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For
$25 or more, in addition to the $5 perk, Elise will also add your
name to a tournament shirt and take a photo, wearing the shirt, which

week or two, until the campaign has ended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For
$50 or more, in addition to the previous perks, you will be mailed a

<p>
</p><p>For
$100 or more, you will be mailed not one, not two, but THREE
hand-made postcards, designed by Elise's father (still Richard F.

something fun in the mail, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now
for the big spenders, for $250 or more, along with the other perks,
you will be shipped an original, canvas painting (approximately
16"" x 20"") by Elise's father (and believe it or not, his work
has actually been sold in galleries.) These paintings will be created
after the campaign is over, shipped at our expense, and will be
accompanied by a hand written letter of thanks from Elise Yates, and a donation of this amount will inspire our undying gratitude! (Only one painting per supporter, please!)

</p><p>If

campaign far and wide! As her parents, we naturally want to see her

her goals! <br/><br/></p><p></p><h3>The
Accomplishments</h3>
<p>
</p><p>At
sixteen years old, Elise has already made a name for herself in the
Northwest. She is the varsity anchor for her high school bowling team
and has been named MVP for the team for two years in a row. She was
recently voted a WIAA State Athlete of the Week, was chosen First
Team All State for the 2013/2014 school year, and was voted Bowler of
the Year by the Greater St. Helens Girls High School Bowling League.
She has received a USBC honor award for 11 strikes in a row during tournament play (a 290
game), carries a 204 average in her weekly league, and has won or
placed in dozens of local tournaments in Washington and Oregon,
including taking 2nd place at the 2013 Triangle Bowl Junior Masters,
despite bowling the final SIX GAMES of the tournament with a thumb

<p>
</p><p>In

our inability to pay the travel costs to get her to Detroit. This
year, we want to make sure she doesn't miss the opportunity to

<p>Elise

We attempt to create art, medicine and relationships that are born of love, patience, and acknowledgement of the simultaneous fragility and strength of the human body. We seek to explore and illuminate the complex interweavings of human ecology and wild ecology, to be better equipped for stewarding the bright and open world we have been given. We find this world in ourselves, each other, our friends and clients, and the wilderness.Bright Hollow seeks to dissolve the false boundaries imposed on all ecologies (on all scales of wilderness, both human and forest) by capitalism and the language of commodity. We seek to cultivate expansive understandings of human potential and responsibility, and insist on the value and importance of generating rooted, individual, powerful, and personal relationships with the wild.What We're DoingWe are currently in the process of starting up medicinal gardens of our own. We are looking to do this in a variety of ways and places. A relatively expansive garden is being planned out at Brook's Bend farm in Montague, where Cea lives. We would also like to plant various natives and endangered plants in the woods around us, for harvesting but also in hopes of supporting threatened plants due to development and over harvesting.Cea has begun to focus more specifically on herbal support for transgender and gender nonconforming health as well as mental health and healing from trauma and seeks to cultivate these spaces in a way that allows them to reflect human and wild processes; that like plants, we experience growth, thirst, setting down roots, digging them up, periods of vibrance and silence. These places will exist not only as gardens but as places of healing, for consultations, for laughter, crying, insanity and growth. We seek to share these spaces with others in a way that is supportive, educational and informative by not only giving medicine and information, but through storytelling and introducing people to the plants themselves, allowing others to make informed decisions for themselves.What We NeedMost of our current costs are for seeds and plants, but we also need bottles, jars, alcohol for tincture making, packaging supplies, etc. Whatever funding we don't use immediately will go into the Bright Hollow fund to help with supplies in the future.If you can't help monetarily, there are other ways to support us! If you have extra seeds, are in Massachusetts and want to help build beds, weed and harvest, are an alcohol (organic grain) supplier, or have extra bottles and jars, we can use them!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>It is very important to me that you know the story behind Tennis For a Better Life Foundation and the reason for what we are doing. Many years ago, as a young boy in a small town in Benin Africa, I (Paul) was given a racquet and a tennis ball. Little did I know these two things were going to be my ticket to a better life. At the age of nine, I was offered a tennis and education  scholarship to come to the United States and train at a Tennis Academy. I was also took in by the most loving family. After traveling and participating in many tournaments including representing my country in the Davis Cup, at the age of eighteen I decided to pursue a college education. I received a full tennis scholarship to Palm Beach Atlantic University, and earned my B.S degree. Today, I am using a tennis racquet and tennis ball to earn my living. </p>
<p> To give back  the same opportunity that was giving to me to other children,   My team and I  started tennis for a better life, a 501 c 3 foundation. We took a trip to Benin, Africa this past August 2014. Before going, We collected used tennis equipment such as racquets, balls, shoes, clothing and tennis bags and took them with us to Cotonou, Benin Africa. Benin  is one of the poorest country in west Africa. In  Benin, there are two popular sports. Children  either play  soccer  or tennis. While there, my team and I had the opportunity to run a tennis tournament for the children, distributed the equipment, fed the children and give away prizes.</p>
<p>Our hearts were filled with compassion for these children who were extremely talented, hungry and passionate about the game of tennis, but had no hope that it could take then anywhere in life or take them out of poverty.  Most of them were playing barefoot. The court they were playing on had cracks everywhere and the nets were very old and had holes. The two post that holds the net up were all rusty and unsafe. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What we saw in Benin, Africa and the condition in which children are playing under, We decided to do more. We spoke to the Benin Tennis Federation directors and they give us the okay to come in and resurface the old tennis courts and build new courts for the children. These are the very courts I learned to play tennis on 20 years ago! </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Being in Africa and spending time with the children made us realize how lucky we are to be living in America. Here in the United States, we have tennis courts at almost every city park, school and community and many times you will find the courts are in great shape, but very empty. These children in Cotonou, Benin Africa love the game of tennis but lack everything we take for granted here in the states. Our foundation is providing the equipment for them now, we want to resurface one old tennis court and build two more for the children. One these courts we would continue to fed and give free tennis clinics, run tournaments, and provide education scholarships to our tournament winners, but in order to do this, we need your help. Your contribution can help us tremendously. Help us give children a chance at a better life through tennis. Thank You! All your contribution are tax deductible.</span></p>

<h2><b>What's The Plan?</b></h2>
<h3>Community Managed Safe Water Project</h3>
<p>Water
Missions Peru uses a community-managed Safe Water Project Model to facilitate
transformational change in Chaquira, Peru, while attacking relational strongholds
of the poverty cycle. This transformational change occurs through sustainable
safe water, sanitation and hygiene education practices. The projects longevity
is supported by a financial plan that accounts for ongoing operational and
equipment replacement costs. The foundation for all of these components is a
stable management structure – the safe water committee (SWC).

</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1198294/files/20150205035116-Peru_Water.JPG?1423137076"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>1.  Community
Mobilization:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>This community-led meeting is the formal
introduction of Rotary and Water Missions Peru to the entire community. The
project objectives and the expectations of each party are discussed and documented
in formal memorandum of understanding (MOU). </p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span>Safe Water Committee Training:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Our Safe Water Committee training is broken into
different sessions. The trainings concentrate on roles and responsibilities,
the formation of a constitution to establish the governing as well as the financial
sustainability aspects of the ongoing operation, money handling and
accountability.</p>
<p>3.<span>  </span>Water,
Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion: </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) awareness
training is conducted for all local leaders to help engage community
support for the project. Volunteer WASH promoters then conduct (4) promotion
cycles in the community: </p>
<p><span> 
i. 
</span>Cycle 1: Water Usage &amp; Contamination </p>
<p><span> 
ii. 
</span>Cycle 2: Water Treatment &amp; Storage </p>
<p><span> 
iii. 
</span>Cycle 3: Hygiene Practices </p>
<p> 
iv. 
Cycle 4: Sanitation</p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Community Provided Sweat Equity:</h3>
<p>Community
equity is required for every project. Only after the
community’s investment is confirmed will Water Missions Peru bring water treatment
equipment to the
community for installation. There are opportunities in every project
for the community to invest. Examples of community equity include supplying
materials for construction, financial investment, and the provision of
skilled and unskilled labor support during construction activities.</p>

<br/><br/>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<h3>Installation of Water Treatment Equipment:</h3>
<p>Water
Missions Peru brings in water treatment equipment specifically selected or
designed for the community. Once installed, Water Missions Peru conducts a detailed
operator training session. After this process the water system is commissioned
and safe water flows into the community.

</p>

<br/>
<h3><span>Post Commissioning Follow-Up &amp; Support:</span></h3>
<p>Work
in the community does not end once a project is commissioned. Water Missions
Peru provides a minimum of one year of follow-up and support. During that
period, Water Missions Peru monitors the technical operation and verifies water
quality, along with monitoring the reliability and work of the SWC. A typical
project’s implementation period can last three to eighteen months. This is a safe
water project, meaning we meet World Health Organization standards for safe water
that is free of all microbiological contaminants. We won’t settle for simply
‘improved’water,
which may still contain harmful contaminates. </p>

</div></div>","This is a $41,977 Rotary Peru Water Global Grant, which will help to supply clean drinking water in the community of Chaquira. We need an additional $5,000, so we are asking for your support.

What is unique about a  Rotary Grant is that every tax deductible dollar donated has the opportunity to grow to $3.50 because of the Rotary Matching Program.


 We are very fortunate to have as our Partner a fantastic NGO, Water Missions International. 
What's The Plan?
Community Managed Safe Water Project
Water
Missions Peru uses a community-managed Safe Water Project Model to facilitate
transformational change in Chaquira, Peru, while attacking relational strongholds
of the poverty cycle. This transformational change occurs through sustainable
safe water, sanitation and hygiene education practices. The projects longevity
is supported by a financial plan that accounts for ongoing operational and
equipment replacement costs. The foundation for all of these components is a
stable management structure – the safe water committee (SWC).





1.  Community
Mobilization:
· 
This community-led meeting is the formal
introduction of Rotary and Water Missions Peru to the entire community. The
project objectives and the expectations of each party are discussed and documented
in formal memorandum of understanding (MOU). 
2. 
Safe Water Committee Training:
· 
Our Safe Water Committee training is broken into
different sessions. The trainings concentrate on roles and responsibilities,
the formation of a constitution to establish the governing as well as the financial
sustainability aspects of the ongoing operation, money handling and
accountability.
3.  Water,
Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion: 
· 
WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) awareness
training is conducted for all local leaders to help engage community
support for the project. Volunteer WASH promoters then conduct (4) promotion
cycles in the community: 
 
i. 
Cycle 1: Water Usage & Contamination 
 
ii. 
Cycle 2: Water Treatment & Storage 
 
iii. 
Cycle 3: Hygiene Practices 
 
iv. 
Cycle 4: Sanitation
Community Provided Sweat Equity:
Community
equity is required for every project. Only after the
community’s investment is confirmed will Water Missions Peru bring water treatment
equipment to the
community for installation. There are opportunities in every project
for the community to invest. Examples of community equity include supplying
materials for construction, financial investment, and the provision of
skilled and unskilled labor support during construction activities.





Installation of Water Treatment Equipment:
Water
Missions Peru brings in water treatment equipment specifically selected or
designed for the community. Once installed, Water Missions Peru conducts a detailed
operator training session. After this process the water system is commissioned
and safe water flows into the community.





Post Commissioning Follow-Up & Support:
Work
in the community does not end once a project is commissioned. Water Missions
Peru provides a minimum of one year of follow-up and support. During that
period, Water Missions Peru monitors the technical operation and verifies water
quality, along with monitoring the reliability and work of the SWC. A typical
project’s implementation period can last three to eighteen months. This is a safe
water project, meaning we meet World Health Organization standards for safe water
that is free of all microbiological contaminants. We won’t settle for simply
‘improved’water,
which may still contain harmful contaminates. 





About Water Missions International
Water Missions International
is a nonprofit Christian engineering organization providing sustainable
safe water and sanitation solutions for people in developing countries
and disaster areas. Using state-of-the-art technology and engineering
expertise, the organization has provided access to safe water for
more than 2.5 million people in 50 countries on five continents since 2001.

spinto dall’amore che mi lega alla campagna, ho desiderato rinsaldare le

l'azienda Tenute Serre, una piccola azienda agricola olearia.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1113865/files/20141223100519-agripano.jpg?1419357919"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>

La nostra azienda,
improntata al rispetto dell'identità territoriale, quella salentina, delle
tradizioni e della maestria degli agricoltori locali si avvale della costante
consulenza tecnica di agronomi ed esperti oleari perché Il nostro compito è proporvi un prodotto sano e
genuino, nel rispetto delle leggi della natura<p></p><p><span>
</span></p><p><b>LA
NOSTRA VISIONE:</b></p>
<p>La nostra azienda produce un olio di oliva biologico di ottima qualitá. </p>
<p>Noi diciamo <b>“No”</b> ai pesticidi
e tutto ció che danneggia la nostra salute perché crediamo che l’alimentazione
corretta insieme ad uno stile di vita sano sia la migliore prevenzione.</p>
<p>Per migliorare il nostro
obiettivo, di primaria importanza é la fase della raccolta delle olive dall´
albero senza danneggiarli, fatta con attrezzature idonee.</p>
<p>Sarebbe indispensabile utilizzare uno scuotitore, una macchina
tecnologicamente all´avanguardia, semovente , vibrante, che ci consente di
risparmiare energie e poter proporre al consumatore un abbattimento del costo
del prodotto.</p><p><b>Questo scuotitore verrà messo a disposizione della cooperativa olearia “la Fasciana” in Presicce in modo che tutti gli agricoltori che non hanno attrezzi idonei ne la possibilità di acquistarli potranno usufruirne.</b><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1113917/files/20141223104013-pinzaita.jpg?1419360013"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/>

Ratta. In 2005, after finishing my 
studies, driven by the love
that binds me to the farmland, 
I wanted to strengthen the
fruitful labors 
of my parents who created the company
Tenuta Serre, a small olive oil farm.
Our company, based on respect of territorial identity, my Salento, as well as on the
traditions and craftsmanship 
of local farmers, uses the constant
technical advice of agronomists
and mill experts, 
because our job is to offer
a healthy and genuine product, 
in full compliance with the law 
of nature.OUR VISION:Our company produces Eco-friendly olive oil of excellent quality.We say ""No"" to pesticides
and everything that 
harms our health, because we firmly believe that
a correct diet  together with a
healthy lifestyle are the best prevention.
To attain this goal, we give primary importance
to the harvest of the olives done with the appropriate equipment,
in order not to damage them.
It is necessary to use shakers, a technologically advanced, propelled,
 vibrant and energy-saving machine, which allows us to sell the product at a competitive price.This shaker will be made available to all members of the Olive oil Cooperative “la Fasciana” in Presicce so that all olive oil farmers who do not possess adequate harvesting tools or who do not have the means to buy them, can benefit from it.



HOW
YOU CAN HELP:You can support 
our project by stamping 
your name inside a fingerprint,
symbol of our oil bottled in 
handmade terracotta bottles.
The bottle will travel around the world, participating in national and international competitions (Switzerland, Japan, Italy, Denmark, USA).
STAY AND LEARN...You can stay on our farm WWW.TENUTASERRE.COM and experience rural education.
We would be eternally grateful if you can share our campaign via your 
social networks (e.g.Facebook,Twitter), email, morse code, 
telegraph, or any other way you can think of!You can help in many other ways,
by talking with your friends and family or sharing our link on your social network...
Spread the word!----------------CHI SIAMO:


Mi chiamo Dario Ratta. Nel 2005,terminati gli studi,
spinto dall’amore che mi lega alla campagna, ho desiderato rinsaldare le
proficue fatiche dei  miei genitori costituendo
l'azienda Tenute Serre, una piccola azienda agricola olearia.


La nostra azienda,
improntata al rispetto dell'identità territoriale, quella salentina, delle
tradizioni e della maestria degli agricoltori locali si avvale della costante
consulenza tecnica di agronomi ed esperti oleari perché Il nostro compito è proporvi un prodotto sano e
genuino, nel rispetto delle leggi della natura
LA
NOSTRA VISIONE:
La nostra azienda produce un olio di oliva biologico di ottima qualitá. 
Noi diciamo “No” ai pesticidi
e tutto ció che danneggia la nostra salute perché crediamo che l’alimentazione
corretta insieme ad uno stile di vita sano sia la migliore prevenzione.
Per migliorare il nostro
obiettivo, di primaria importanza é la fase della raccolta delle olive dall´
albero senza danneggiarli, fatta con attrezzature idonee.
Sarebbe indispensabile utilizzare uno scuotitore, una macchina
tecnologicamente all´avanguardia, semovente , vibrante, che ci consente di
risparmiare energie e poter proporre al consumatore un abbattimento del costo
del prodotto.Questo scuotitore verrà messo a disposizione della cooperativa olearia “la Fasciana” in Presicce in modo che tutti gli agricoltori che non hanno attrezzi idonei ne la possibilità di acquistarli potranno usufruirne.

improve confidence and strengthen group cohesion. 
<p></p><p><b>Our Intent:</b></p>
<p>We know that both music therapy and yoga as individual modalities have 
had positive effects for individuals who have experienced trauma. We 
truly believe that this collaboration of bringing yoga and music
therapy together will be beneficial for participants as well.  We hope that the tools given in
this class will have a positive effect both during the class and that
participants can incorporate these modalities into their own healing journey.
Because this is a pilot program, we look forward to compiling quantitative and
qualitative research, with the permission of our participants, in order to
improve our class for the future and to educate other practitioners about the
benefits and/or challenges of this collaboration. We plan to focus on the following questions:</p>

</ul></div>","Cliquez ici ou faites défiler vers le bas pour le français Ever wonder why you flip your pillow to the cool side when you cannot sleep? Because temperature is key to good sleep!Moona is a patent-pending smart sleep system that induces and deepens sleep, by smartly adjusting your head and neck temperature throughout the night. It will also help you wake up naturally, and be ready for the day! A clinical study is ongoing at Nantes Hospital, France.Our body needs different temperatures at different moments in the night. Moona understands your sleeping pattern and regulates the temperature of your head and neck to help you get the best sleep.
 Doctors have shown that temperature is a key parameter of sleep (Wall Street Journal).To fall asleep, our body temperature needs to cool down: we need to lose approximately 1°C (1.8ºF). And cooler temperatures help get deeper sleep. At the end of the night, it is opposite: our body needs to warm up to wake up gently and be productive quickly.Evolution of body temperature throughout the nightMoona is a water-based system which brings cooling and heating to your head in a smooth and natural way, guaranteeing the best sleep experience. The product is composed of 4 key elements. (There are no electronics under the head : just a thin membrane with water and memory foam.)  Getting good sleep is very important to making the most out of your day. With Moona, you will improve your mood and energy. Getting quality sleep is also key to your health. This why, from the very beginning of the project, we have worked with sleep doctors. In collaboration with the University Hospital Center of Nantes, we are conducting a clinical study to demonstrate Moona's efficacy.  Our world is in the middle of a sleep crisis but not everyone is aware of it. Lack of good quality sleep has profound consequences on our daily lives. It affects our health, our job performance, our relationships and our happiness. Poor sleep may put you at risk of several health issues, such as: 
Obesity, 
Diabetes, 
Cardiovascular diseases and hypertension, 
Immune function disorders... 
As best-selling author Arianna Huffington puts it: “Only by renewing our relationship with sleep can we take back control of our lives.” That’s why we created Moona, with the ambition to help you sleep better and, more importantly, live better. Sleep with Moona and enjoy the best your life has to offer.  
We have been very focused on making sure we leverage the power of technology. However we do not want the technology to take over your bedroom environment. That is why you do not have to use the app before you go to bed or during the night. And all transmissions from the product can be shut down during the night.
   With a patent-pending technology, the Moona smart sleep system will learn over time to adapt your temperature profile throughout the night and the year. Before your first night with Moona, you will fill out a sleep questionnaire to determine your sleeper's profile. Then, Moona will guide you through optimizing it during a 10-day period. After that, Moona will adapt the temperature profile (ºC/ºF) to optimize your sleep, using data from: 
the integrated sleep tracker,
ambient temperature and humidity sensors,
temperature changes made during the night,
feedback provided in the app.
Our system is based on the latest sleep research literature and we are training it with sleep data from our beta testers. The more users we will have, the smarter the system will get. It will then be able to learn and adapt to each user more efficiently.   Your bedroom is a cocoon. We have worked very hard to create a product that blends into your bedroom and an experience that seamlessly helps you sleep, without struggle.Moona is quick and easy to set up. Even at 3am, it is very easy to change the temperature on the product if need be, and of course you do not have to open the app for that. We have done more than 200 user tests to get a great experience - even in the middle of the night.  Keep your favorite pillow:Moona goes on top of any standard pillow, no matter the shape or material. Our beta-testers tried with synthetic, memory foam, orthopedic pillows and with all kind of shapes and sizes. We've iterated on more than 30 material combinations to guarantee optimal thermal efficiency and comfort. The pillow pad is an obsessively engineered combination of memory foam and thin water channels.   We know how comfort is key to our sleep so we created a product that not only enhances your sleep quality but also adds extra comfort to your sleep experience. Don’t you love putting your head on a cool pillow when you go to bed? How about if you could have that great feeling over and over again during the night?
The pad is flexible so it follows your move during the night
The cover is made of cotton. It is removable and machine washable
The bedside device is very silent (<25db, less than a whisper)
   Throughout our journey developing Moona, more than 200 beta-testers have given us precious feedback on our product. That is over 350 nights of sleep ... a year of sleep data ! Here is what some of them said:      
 To develop Moona, we are working with doctors. A medical thesis on Moona’s system is ongoing at the Hospital of Nantes. And here are some of the research papers we used:

   Demo of Moona as of September 2017: We want Moona to be a night and life-changing product. That’s why we’re doing everything that is in our power to design the perfect sleep product. But we need your help - your feedback, suggestions, and above all, excitement - to help us build Moona up to the potential it can be.The funds we raise will go directly to help us deliver a high-quality product, that is rigorously tested and manufactured. It will help us invest in tooling for production, testing and quality assurance.Back our project, share our page, and let’s make this happen! We’re counting on you!     We would like to thank all of you who have contributed to bringing this project to life, through creative, technical, medical and financial support, and more importantly by testing, giving us precious feedback and insights to develop our product. This includes our friends and families, testers, mentors and advisors, HAX, Centrale Paris Incubator, Agoranov, Zagatub, the University Hospital Center of Nantes, La French Tech, Business France, BPI. Thanks to Sidekick Creatives for making our Kickstarter video.Here are pictures of some of the tests we have done. Thanks to all our beta-testers for their feedbacks and ideas!  Some of the designs we worked on  And here are some of our prototypes:  Press kit | Facebook | Twitter | LinkedIn -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FrenchMoona - Régulation intelligente de la température de l'oreiller pour améliorer le sommeilVous êtes-vous déjà demandé pourquoi vous retourniez votre oreiller du côté frais quand vous n’arrivez pas à dormir ? Parce que la température est un facteur clé du sommeil !Moona est un système breveté intelligent qui permet de s'endormir plus rapidement et d'avoir plus de sommeil profond, en ajustant intelligemment la température de la tête et du cou tout au long de la nuit. Moona vous aidera aussi à vous réveiller naturellement et à bien commencer la journée ! Notre corps a besoin de différentes températures à différents moments de la nuit. Moona comprend votre rythme de sommeil et régule la température de votre tête et de votre cou pour vous aider à avoir un meilleur sommeil. Moona est un système à base d’eau qui apporte de la fraîcheur et de la chaleur à votre tête de manière douce et naturelle, en garantissant la meilleure expérience de sommeil. Le produit se compose de 4 éléments. (Pas d'électronique sous la tête, c'est une membrane en mousse, traversée d'eau).  DORMEZ MIEUX QUE JAMAIS Des médecins et chercheurs ont montré que, pour s’endormir, la température de notre corps doit diminuer (nous devons perdre environ 1°C). Pendant la nuit, des températures fraîches vous aident à mieux dormir. Au réveil, c’est le contraire : notre corps doit se réchauffer pour se réveiller en douceur et nous permettre d'être productif plus rapidement. Et notre tête joue un rôle majeur dans la régulation de notre température corporelle.Une étude clinique est en cours sur Moona au CHU de Nantes.
Un bon sommeil est la meilleure façon d'être en pleine forme pendant la journée et de bonne humeur! Voici ce que Moona permet :  CAPTEURS & FONCTIONNALITÉS CLÉSMoona est associé à une application. Voici ces fonctionnalités principales :

Réveil naturel : Vous détestez votre réveil bruyant ? Des températures chaudes déclencheront un réveil plus naturel et vous prépareront à être productif plus rapidement. Si vous préférez (par exemple pendant les mois d’été plus chauds) vous pourrez aussi utiliser la fonction “réveil frais”.

Profil de température : Visualisez comment la température de Moona évoluera au cours de la nuit et réglez-la manuellement si vous le souhaitez (ºC ou ºF).

Analyse du sommeil : En fonction de vos mouvements pendant la nuit, Moona suit votre sommeil. L’application vous donnera des renseignements précieux sur la qualité de votre sommeil.

Analyse de l’environnement de la chambre : Grâce à des capteurs de température, d’humidité et de luminosité ambiantes, Moona analyse aussi votre environnement de sommeil, et étudie la corrélation entre la qualité de votre sommeil et votre environnement.

Conseils sommeil personnalisés : Moona utilise les données récoltées par les capteurs et vos retours dans l'appli, pour vous proposer des améliorations, des habitudes et des conseils pour améliorer votre sommeil. 
 ALGORITHMES DE MACHINE LEARNINGAvec sa technologie brevetée, Moona apprendra au cours du temps à optimiser votre profil de température au cours de la nuit et des saisons.Avant votre première nuit avec Moona, vous remplirez un questionnaire pour déterminer votre profil de dormeur. Ensuite, Moona vous guidera pendant 10 jours pour optimiser votre sommeil. Après, Moona continuera à adapter le profil de température (ºC/ºF) pour optimiser votre sommeil, en utilisant des données provenant :
du capteur de sommeil intégré
des capteurs de température et d’humidité ambiantes
des changements de températures effectués pendant la nuit
des vos retours fournis dans l’application
Notre système se fonde sur les dernières avancées dans la recherche sur le sommeil et nous entraînons le système avec les données fournies par nos beta-testeurs. Plus nous aurons d’utilisateurs, plus le système deviendra intelligent. Il sera ensuite capable d’apprendre et de s’adapter à chaque utilisateur plus efficacement. DESIGN PRODUIT Votre chambre à coucher est votre cocon. Nous avons beaucoup travaillé pour créer un produit qui s’intègre dans votre chambre et qui vous permet de mieux dormir sans effort.Moona est facile et rapide à mettre en place. Même à 3 heures du matin, il est très facile de changer la température sur le boîtier si besoin.  Evidemment, pas besoin d’utiliser l’application au milieu de la nuit. Nous avons effectué plus de 200 tests utilisateurs pour assurer la meilleure expérience utilisateur, même au milieu de la nuit. Conservez votre oreiller préféré :Moona s’adapte à n’importe quel oreiller, peu importe la taille ou le matériau. Nos beta testeurs ont essayé Moona avec des oreillers synthétiques, à mémoire de forme, orthopédiques… Bref, de toutes sortes. Le sur-oreiller est une combinaison de mousse à mémoire de forme et des fins canaux d’eau. CONFORT ET MATÉRIAUXNous savons que le confort est clef pour notre sommeil donc nous avons créé un produit qui non seulement améliore la qualité de votre sommeil mais rajoute aussi du confort.""La fraicheur de l'oreiller est relaxante et très efficace pour s'endormir rapidement!"" - Jake, 27 ans ""Moona est très confortable!"" - Luke, 30 ans ""La mise en place est très simple. J'ai hâte chaque soir d'allumer mon Moona."" - Sandrine, 47 ans Quoi de mieux que la sensation de fraicheur de l'oreiller frais en allant se coucher ? Et si vous pouviez avoir cette sensation toute la nuit ?
La membrane est flexible donc elle suit vos mouvements pendant la nuit
La membrane est recouverte de coton. Elle est déhoussable et lavable en machine
Le boîtier est très silencieux (<25dB)
 ILS ONT TESTÉ MOONA... ET ILS ONT ADORÉAu cours de notre aventure, plus de 200 beta-testeurs nous ont donné leur avis sur notre produit. C’est plus de 350 nuits de sommeil… une année de données sur le sommeil !


 
L'IMPORTANCE DU SOMMEIL DANS NOS VIESMême si nous n'en sommes pas tous conscient, notre monde est au milieu d'une crise du sommeil. Le manque de sommeil  a des conséquences profondes sur notre vie quotidienne. Cela affecte notre santé, nos performances professionnelles, nos relations et notre bien-être.Un mauvais sommeil peut vous mettre à risque de plusieurs problèmes de santé, tels que:
Obésité
Diabète
Maladies cardiovasculaires et hypertension artérielle
Troubles de la fonction immunitaire
Comme le dit Arianna Huffington : ""Ce n'est qu'en renouvelant notre relation avec le sommeil que nous pouvons reprendre le contrôle de nos vies"". C'est pourquoi nous avons créé Moona, avec l'ambition de vous aider à mieux dormir et, plus important encore, vivre mieux. LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE Pour s'endormir, notre température corporelle doit refroidir: nous devons perdre environ 1°C. Et les températures fraîches permettent un sommeil plus profond: notre sommeil est le plus réparateur au minimum de la température corporelle. Au contraire, nous devons nous réchauffer pour nous réveiller et nous sommes les plus productifs lorsque la température de notre corps augmente. La tête et le cou jouent un rôle central dans la régulation de la température corporelle. Pour développer Moona, nous travaillons avec des médecins, une étude clinique est en cours au CHU de Nantes. Voici quelques-unes des publications scientifiques que nous avons utilisées :

Did you know, in the United States, over 4,000 people drowned last year alone?  Drowning is the # 1 cause of fatality for kids under 5.  Some of the reasons for this are that it is extremely hard to detect, it can happen silently, and can occur in as little as 20 seconds. Sadly, 88% of drownings occur with some type of supervision present, meaning most of them may have been prevented. For every drowning fatality, there are five near-drowning victims, who suffer some type of neurological damage.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433212777/xwjr5rnnw4ut50lxrnyp.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 621.515892420538px; height: 410px;""/></p><div><br/></div><br/><p><b>Our mission </b></p><p>We are fathers and entrepreneurs who are aiming to make iSWIMBAND the new aquatic safety standard worldwide.

<h3><b>Questions and Answers:</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q. </b>Will this
chair replace my doctor?</p>
<p><b>A.</b> No, it will be
an additional tool, like a stethoscope, that will help your doctor provide care in a more timely manner, without requiring you to drive long distances or sit in waiting rooms for hours. </p>
<p><b>Q.</b> How will this
affect my insurance?</p>
<p><b>A.</b> Insurance
companies and the Federal government are looking into Telemedicine in order to
reduce the cost of healthcare. Over time, we expect most insurance companies as
well as the Federal government’s Medicare and Medicaid programs to accept usage
of the chair.</p>
<p><b>Q.</b> Will this put
anyone out of work?</p>
<p><b>A.</b> No. In fact,
the chair may create additional jobs since nurses, receptionists
and other staff will be required onsite where the chairs are located. Right
now, doctors maintain staff at their primary location. With the chair, doctors will
be able to open fully staffed remote offices. </p>
<p><b>Q. </b>Will the
quality of my healthcare go down?</p>
<p><b>A.</b> No. Doctors
will be able to perform the same type of examination for a primary evaluation
they currently do in person using the chair.</p>
<p><b>Q. </b>Why will my
doctor want to use something like this? </p>
<p><b>A. </b>Doctors, by
their very nature, are on the leading edge of technology. A doctor who doesn’t
keep up with new methods and tools is usually behind on illnesses and diagnosis
as well. An informal doctor survey found that 88% would use the chair or any
other tool that helps them provide better care for their patients. If your
doctor is against telemedicine you should find out why. It is fine if your
doctor doesn’t want to lose the social interaction and intimacy of physically
seeing patients, but if your doctor is against technology, then it might be
wise to look for another doctor. </p>
<p><b>Q.</b> How will this
chair help me?</p>
<p><b>A.</b> You will have
more options when you need primary healthcare. If your doctor is not able to
see you right away, you will be able to have other doctors within your network
see you. Doctors in certain areas are extremely busy and usually have a two to
three week backlog. If all you need is a checkup, waiting that long is no big
deal, but if you a tick bite, fever, flu, mild allergic reaction or other
condition that is easily treated when caught early, waiting may result in a
visit to the emergency room. </p>
<p>It will also make it possible for you to be seen by your
specialist after the initial treatment without having to drive long distances. Post-operative
visits to specialists usually require long drives for the specialist to have a quick
look to see how you’re healing. The chair makes it possible for the specialist
to see you in your own hometown, without having to drive hours or go through
traffic. </p>
<p>Since vital data normally collected by the doctor’s office
will be automated, errors which usually occur when someone does this manually
will be eliminated. </p>
<p>Hospitals and clinics will be able to open health centers in
urban areas that do not have enough doctors. Cities will be able to place the
chairs in shelters and emergency crisis centers so that primary evaluations can
be made by a qualified doctor without needing to send everyone to the hospital
emergency room, reducing the cost of healthcare for most cities and government
agencies. </p>
<p>The chair will reduce costly visits to the emergency room,
saving you, your insurance company and the government money. It will also
reduce the chances of taking sick days, since early treatment leads to a quicker
recovery.</p>
<p>The chair will give you access to local primary healthcare
on a 24 x 7 basis. </p>
<p><b>Q. </b>Will the
government allow doctors to do remote examinations?</p>
<p><b>A.</b> President
Obama has directed the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMI) to
test new models of care using telemedicine. The federal, state and city
governments are all looking for ways to reduce the cost of healthcare.
Telemedicine and tools like the telemed chair are options they are currently
exploring. </p>
<p><b>Q.</b> Is
telemedicine a growing field? </p>
<p><b>A.</b> Hospitals have
been using telemedicine for quite some time. Remote surgery, which allows surgeons
to operate remotely, is currently in use by the best doctors and hospitals in
the world. Hospitals have also been using specialists in countries which have a
12 hour time difference to examine test results, eliminating the need to wake a
local specialist in the middle of the night. </p>
<p>A BCC Research reports, Global Markets for Telemedicine
Technologies, says the global telemedicine market has grown from 9.8 billion in
2010 to 11.6 in 2011 and is expected to reach $27.3 in 2016, $11.3 billion for
technology and $16 billion for services.</p>
<p>The report says global telemedicine demand is growing and
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is driving the increase of
national adoption of the technology.</p>
<p>Telemedicine is also being adopted by several nations to

<p>The Handie’s catcher cup allows you to quickly dispose of your little swimmers without a mess. Simply push the cup inside out over the toilet, then flush!

<p><b>Self Lubrication: </b>Chaffing is a thing of the past!</p>
<p>We are society that has conquered land, sea, and air, so it stands to reason we should be able to conquer chaffing as well. The Handie has a built in self lubrication system that delivers lube directly into the palm of your hand. Fill the chamber, replace the cap, and with the push of a button, you'll never chafe yourself again.</p>

<p><b>Vibration: </b>Everyone wants a good buzz!</p>

<p><b>Silky Soft Material: </b>Never bare hand it again!</p>

<p><b>Textured Penetration Control: </b>Nothing better than getting it in!</p>
<p>With The Handie you have full control of everything, including the pressure of your penetration into the catcher cup. Loose or tight, its up to you (but don't let the power go to your head).

  Whats supported in the first release?
 What is supported in the first release depends solely on funding. The more funding we receive, the more features the software will support. You may contact us directly to inquire about specific features. email openerpmaster@gmail.com 
Sales order management
 Visual datamapper enables you to add your custom attributes to Odoo

Payment management, Fulfillment Management

What isn't supported? 


Mage2odoo is designed to support 1 Magento instance. Why? 80% of clients we have worked with have only 1 instance. Magento out of box supports multiple websites. Doing it this way significantly simplifies the connector, provides a more stable product, and makes it easier to support.
Mage2odoo is designed specifically for Magento. It does not integrate other services like Amazon, eBay, etc. You can however use already available tools to import these orders into Magento and then manage them in Odoo.

</p><p>On June 14-15, 2014, I will compete in the Liver life Challenge Mount Shasta Climb to raise funds for
the American Liver Foundation – the nation’s leading nonprofit organization dedicated to liver health
and disease prevention. My goal is to raise more than $ 2,500 for this worthy cause.  If I can get 250 people to donate $10 each, we will have reached this goal.  Will you help me by donating and getting your friends to see this as well?</p>
<p>Liver disease is often unknown or misunderstood. Here are some compelling statistics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are approximately 100 different types of liver disease, 1 out of every 10 Americans is affected by at least one type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is 30 million people - the equivalent of the combined population of America’s 15 largest cities!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of the 26,000 people who die each year from cirrhosis, 60% have no history of alcohol abuse.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearly 17,000 people are on the waiting list for a liver transplant.
</p>
<p>The American Liver Foundation is dedicated to a future where there are effective treatments, cures, and
no one dies waiting for a liver transplant. The Foundation provides research, education, advocacy and
support for people living with liver disease, and aims to meet patients and families at their point of crisis to
provide the resources they need.

My wife and my son have a seasonal allergy. Their symptoms include a runny nose, sneezing, itching, rash, and swelling. I and my family devoted over ten years to reduce seasonal allergy. Finally, I and my family made an anti allergy potable personal air pollution purifying system using water or mixed liquid. I will briefly explain you about related patented invention that we invented.</b></p><p><b>1. </b><b>Field of the Invention</b></p><p><b>The invention relates to methods and apparatus for purifying contaminated air, and more specifically to methods and apparatus for forming a liquid filter using centrifugal force that is applied to the liquid to eliminate contaminants.</b></p><p><b>2. </b><b>Description of the Invention</b></p><p><b>A device of the invention includes an air inlet structure and an air outlet structure. An invented device purifies air using a liquid filter which is formed when the air purifying compartment rotates. An invented device also includes a motor that is coupled to the air purifying compartment to enable the air purifying compartment to rotate around a rotational axis. The mixed liquid filter is formed by centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the air purifying compartment coupled to a motor.                      </b></p><p><b>An impeller which is at the air outlet structure creates a pressure difference which causes contaminated air created by a contaminant to move into a contaminated air transfer chamber, a contaminated air inlet, and a contaminated air inlet passageway to reach the air purifying compartment. </b></p><p><b>3. </b><b>Related Art</b></p><p><b>There are generally three techniques of purifying air.  One is the usage of a particulate or adsorption filter. Materials commonly used in these filters include, among others, glass fiber, cellulose paper, cotton, polyurethane, and other synthetic materials.</b></p><p><b>A second technique uses a sprayer. The basic operating principles of a sprayer is to capture the contaminants in the air using fine liquid particles and to control humidity simultaneously.</b></p><p><b>A third technique uses an electrostatic air filter. An electrostatic air filter first passes dirty air between ionizing wires which are at a high voltage.</b></p><p><b>Existing air purification filter systems have significant disadvantages.  First, particulate filters need regular cleaning, maintenance, and replacement.  In addition, the contaminants removed by the filters and used filters become another origin of contamination.  Secondly, a sprayer requires constant ejection of water to eliminate contaminants in the air, resulting in excessive usage of water. Thirdly, an electrostatic air filter requires a complex electronic device, and its initial installation cost is high.</b></p><p><b>4. Summary of the Invention</b></p><p><b>The invention has the following advantages:  First, because the air purifying system of the invention utilizes a simple mechanical structure and a simple purifying method, various costs associated with the invented system such as the manufacturing, maintenance, and operational cost are significantly lower than those of existing air purifying systems. Second, the invented system can provide various air purifying capabilities using centrifugal force and can purify air in multi stages.  As a result, the invented system can achieve a higher degree of purification efficiency in comparison with that of existing air purifying systems.</b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Large Scale Air Pollution Purifying System using Water or Mixed Liquid:</b></p><p></p><p><b>1.

I will briefly explain you about related patented invention that we invented.1. Field of the InventionThe invention relates to methods and apparatus for purifying contaminated air, and more specifically to methods and apparatus for forming a liquid filter using centrifugal force that is applied to the liquid to eliminate contaminants.2. Description of the InventionA device of the invention includes an air inlet structure and an air outlet structure. An invented device purifies air using a liquid filter which is formed when the air purifying compartment rotates. An invented device also includes a motor that is coupled to the air purifying compartment to enable the air purifying compartment to rotate around a rotational axis. The mixed liquid filter is formed by centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the air purifying compartment coupled to a motor.                      An impeller which is at the air outlet structure creates a pressure difference which causes contaminated air created by a contaminant to move into a contaminated air transfer chamber, a contaminated air inlet, and a contaminated air inlet passageway to reach the air purifying compartment. 3. Related ArtThere are generally three techniques of purifying air.  One is the usage of a particulate or adsorption filter. Materials commonly used in these filters include, among others, glass fiber, cellulose paper, cotton, polyurethane, and other synthetic materials.A second technique uses a sprayer. The basic operating principles of a sprayer is to capture the contaminants in the air using fine liquid particles and to control humidity simultaneously.A third technique uses an electrostatic air filter. An electrostatic air filter first passes dirty air between ionizing wires which are at a high voltage.Existing air purification filter systems have significant disadvantages.  First, particulate filters need regular cleaning, maintenance, and replacement.  In addition, the contaminants removed by the filters and used filters become another origin of contamination.  Secondly, a sprayer requires constant ejection of water to eliminate contaminants in the air, resulting in excessive usage of water. Thirdly, an electrostatic air filter requires a complex electronic device, and its initial installation cost is high.4. Summary of the InventionThe invention has the following advantages:  First, because the air purifying system of the invention utilizes a simple mechanical structure and a simple purifying method, various costs associated with the invented system such as the manufacturing, maintenance, and operational cost are significantly lower than those of existing air purifying systems. Second, the invented system can provide various air purifying capabilities using centrifugal force and can purify air in multi stages.  As a result, the invented system can achieve a higher degree of purification efficiency in comparison with that of existing air purifying systems.Large Scale Air Pollution Purifying System using Water or Mixed Liquid:1. Principles Put centrifuge force, which is produced by rotating axis to liquid or liquid mixture. Put air to the arbitrary direction. Make chambers inside of outer column using curtains. Mix air and liquid or liquid mixture at the inside of chambers. Pass mixing air to space between rotating curtain and outer column where established liquid column produced by centrifuge force caused by rotating axis. Contain liquid or liquid mixture in outer column and air in inner column.2. ApplicationsReplacing of the principles of exiting air filter, these principles can be applied for the living space of human being such as inside room air cleaner for housing, apartment, commercial building, and drink bar, air conditioner, motor fan, vacuum cleaner, inside of car, harmful-gas emitting vehicle, air smoke pollution factory, waste garbage trash burner, thermo-electric power plant, environmental glass, personal potable air purifier, HVAC system in building, inside of subway, subway station, air plane, submarine, and etc. 3.

While most room elements can be selected to limit opportunities for self-injury, options for door security have been limited and do not provide protection at all portions of a door and its hardware. The development of a comprehensive door monitoring system that could reduce unnecessary client death or injury and limit costly claims settlements was an exciting opportunity. Approximately  1,500 suicides occur annually in US inpatient hospital units, with 75% involving hanging and over 40% of those attempts are by hanging on doors. Just doing some quick math, that's over 400 lives that could be saved with our door monitoring system.</p><p>The creation of a reliable operating sensor mechanism was a difficult challenge. To meet the goals of sensitivity, reliability, flexibility and ease of staff operation for both new and retrofit doors, we spent over two years working with our consulting engineers developing and improving a mechanical, electronic, and programming system. The forces on door hinges are surprisingly complex, but we were able to resolve these issues by using multiple sensor points and data management programming. The resulting system has variable sensitivity that allows for the normal use of the doors while notifying staff immediately if a patient attempts to use any part of the door assembly for self-injury.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/466435/files/20140328061535-image2_450.jpg?1396012535"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Overall installed system</i><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/466441/files/20140328061651-image1_450.jpg?1396012611"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Sensor</i><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/466443/files/20140328061724-image5_450.jpg?1396012644"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Open door</i><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/466447/files/20140328061750-image3_450.jpg?1396012670"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Monitor in Normal Status Green</i><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/466450/files/20140328061856-image4_450.jpg?1396012736"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Monitor in Alarm Status Red</i><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>How Does it Work?</h3><p></p><p>Unlike other alarm systems that cover only portions of a patient door, the SentinelStop system is the only one available that provides remote monitoring of <i>every part</i> of a patient door to prevent self-injury. It is invisible to the patient, tamper-proof, safe, accurate and dependable. Once installed, SentinelStop provides accurate and instantaneous monitoring. </p><p>In simple terms, the sensor system turns a patient door into a weight scale which will register any increase or decrease in weight from the norm. It will alert staff at the slightest indication of excess weight on a door frame, regardless of where weight is applied: hinge, latch, or the door itself. </p><p>A central monitor displays a floor plan with a visual warning and audio alarm when weight is imposed on any part of the door assembly. An alarm event changes the normal green status bar to red and indicates exactly which door/room requires immediate attention. The alarm cannot be disabled until the cause of the alarm has been attended to.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/466451/files/20140328062011-Monitor_Green_Status.jpg?1396012811"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Sensor connections and monitor showing normal door status</i><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/466454/files/20140328062102-Single_room_Alarm_Red_Status_Lighter.jpg?1396012862"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Individual door icon showing an alarm status</i><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Why We Need You</h3><p>Over the past three years we have developed working prototypes of our sensor system and verified its functionality and signal quality. We want to take our product to the next level. As sensors are now more readily available and much smaller than when we started developing our sensor system, we will work with a well-known sensor manufacturing company to reduce both the size and resulting cost of our system meeting our development goals. </p><p>Your donations will allow us to complete the engineering work for the smaller, more cost effective sensor, refine the computer programs, manufacture and install the sensor into a VA demonstration site to monitor the results prior to a larger-scale production of the sensor units. When you assist us in our goal, you will be helping us save lives.</p><h3>What Makes SentinelStop Different?</h3><p>The SentinelStop sensor system is the only product on the market that can provide total door protection. Many products currently on the market can be defeated by the patient. Furthermore, typical top of door sensors are accessible by the patient increasing false alarms. This makes SentinelStop a great tool for mental health caregivers. </p><p>The SentinelStop sensor is designed for either new construction or retrofitting existing door frames. Since the system can detect weight placed on any part of the door, it is not necessary to change existing door hardware or accessories except the hinges.</p><p>Our dedication to reducing and eliminating opportunities for suicide at inpatient mental health units is our top priority. A reliable warning system in a patient's room that alerts staff quickly of a potential suicide attempt will allow caregivers to immediately assist the patient, enabling them to receive needed treatment, to heal and return to a normal productive life. The physical safety of the client is our inspiration to continue to forge ahead with our sensor technology. </p><p>Our ground-breaking system was nominated by one of our medical clients for consideration as a top innovative product in the healthcare market. SentinelStop was subsequently awarded a place in <i>HEALTHCARE DESIGN's</i> 2010 Top 10 Platinum Products highlighting the Top 10 designs that displayed a flair for creativity, with usefulness and inventiveness.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/466460/files/20140328062321-HealthCare_Design_Magazine.jpg?1396013001"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>Production Plan</h3>We have come a long way since our idea began to take shape and with you, we will be able to move forward in our goal to save lives.<div>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>Product development and design is inherently difficult. Bringing a technology product to market has many challenges. We have spent over 3 years developing a functioning prototype that has undergone extensive testing. These test results have led us to a more compact and cost-effective design. All that is left is to synthesize the final design with our development partners, refine our computer programs to include learning software to adapt to each doors swing load and schedule a production prototype run. We will partner with a VA facility to install test units in their mental health unit and work with us to fine-tune the sensor system operations.</p>

</div></div>","Our StoryAfter years of designing mental health units for healthcare systems and state facilities, our team recognized the need to move beyond traditional thinking in room design to reduce and eliminate the opportunity for a patient to intentionally harm themselves. While most room elements can be selected to limit opportunities for self-injury, options for door security have been limited and do not provide protection at all portions of a door and its hardware. The development of a comprehensive door monitoring system that could reduce unnecessary client death or injury and limit costly claims settlements was an exciting opportunity. Approximately  1,500 suicides occur annually in US inpatient hospital units, with 75% involving hanging and over 40% of those attempts are by hanging on doors. Just doing some quick math, that's over 400 lives that could be saved with our door monitoring system.The creation of a reliable operating sensor mechanism was a difficult challenge. To meet the goals of sensitivity, reliability, flexibility and ease of staff operation for both new and retrofit doors, we spent over two years working with our consulting engineers developing and improving a mechanical, electronic, and programming system. The forces on door hinges are surprisingly complex, but we were able to resolve these issues by using multiple sensor points and data management programming. The resulting system has variable sensitivity that allows for the normal use of the doors while notifying staff immediately if a patient attempts to use any part of the door assembly for self-injury.Overall installed systemSensorOpen doorMonitor in Normal Status GreenMonitor in Alarm Status RedHow Does it Work?Unlike other alarm systems that cover only portions of a patient door, the SentinelStop system is the only one available that provides remote monitoring of every part of a patient door to prevent self-injury. It is invisible to the patient, tamper-proof, safe, accurate and dependable. Once installed, SentinelStop provides accurate and instantaneous monitoring. In simple terms, the sensor system turns a patient door into a weight scale which will register any increase or decrease in weight from the norm. It will alert staff at the slightest indication of excess weight on a door frame, regardless of where weight is applied: hinge, latch, or the door itself. A central monitor displays a floor plan with a visual warning and audio alarm when weight is imposed on any part of the door assembly. An alarm event changes the normal green status bar to red and indicates exactly which door/room requires immediate attention. The alarm cannot be disabled until the cause of the alarm has been attended to.Sensor connections and monitor showing normal door statusIndividual door icon showing an alarm statusWhy We Need YouOver the past three years we have developed working prototypes of our sensor system and verified its functionality and signal quality. We want to take our product to the next level. As sensors are now more readily available and much smaller than when we started developing our sensor system, we will work with a well-known sensor manufacturing company to reduce both the size and resulting cost of our system meeting our development goals. Your donations will allow us to complete the engineering work for the smaller, more cost effective sensor, refine the computer programs, manufacture and install the sensor into a VA demonstration site to monitor the results prior to a larger-scale production of the sensor units. When you assist us in our goal, you will be helping us save lives.What Makes SentinelStop Different?The SentinelStop sensor system is the only product on the market that can provide total door protection. Many products currently on the market can be defeated by the patient. Furthermore, typical top of door sensors are accessible by the patient increasing false alarms. This makes SentinelStop a great tool for mental health caregivers. The SentinelStop sensor is designed for either new construction or retrofitting existing door frames. Since the system can detect weight placed on any part of the door, it is not necessary to change existing door hardware or accessories except the hinges.Our dedication to reducing and eliminating opportunities for suicide at inpatient mental health units is our top priority. A reliable warning system in a patient's room that alerts staff quickly of a potential suicide attempt will allow caregivers to immediately assist the patient, enabling them to receive needed treatment, to heal and return to a normal productive life. The physical safety of the client is our inspiration to continue to forge ahead with our sensor technology. Our ground-breaking system was nominated by one of our medical clients for consideration as a top innovative product in the healthcare market. SentinelStop was subsequently awarded a place in HEALTHCARE DESIGN's 2010 Top 10 Platinum Products highlighting the Top 10 designs that displayed a flair for creativity, with usefulness and inventiveness.Production PlanWe have come a long way since our idea began to take shape and with you, we will be able to move forward in our goal to save lives.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Clair Carr and I am a single mom of two. My 20 year old son Robert Carrie was diagnosed 4 years ago with stage 3 kidney failure due to a disease called FSGS (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis). He has high blood pressure from the kidney failure and is on 6 different medications at this time. He is currently stage 4 and on the waiting list for a kidney transplant. It can take up to 3 - 3 1/2 years to receive a transplant. He is a very smart, caring person. He is planning to return to college where he wants to take courses that will enable him to pursue a career in game design.  I also support my 22 year old daughter Caitlin and her almost 2 year old daughter Madison. Madison had a traumatic birth injury where her shoulder was stuck during birth. She was born with a Brachial Plexis injury that left her unable to use her left arm at all due to the nerves being stretched. She has since had two surgeries, and now has limited use of her arm. She is extremely smart, funny, sweet and determined. She does not let it slow her down and even learned to walk after her second surgery with a big brace on her arm and upper body. I am currently going back to school so that I will be able to get a better job to support my family. While I am in school, I am working part time and having to pay cobra health insurance. I am almost done (graduate February 3rd!). I will still have to pay cobra for several months after I find a job and wait for the benefits to take effect. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I hope that it will encourage other single mothers to step out in faith and strive for a better life for them and their children. I have gotten through everything going on in our lives through my faith in God. He is my strength and my sustainer. It was through him that I was led to this website where I can post our story and reach out to others in our time of need. I look forward to the time when I can in turn bless others the way we have been blessed. It will help me to keep the much needed medical coverage my family needs in the coming months. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our cobra payments are over a thousand a month. The money we receive from the campaign will help to pay the cost of this and also for co-pays for doctor visits, prescriptions, etc. He will also be starting on dialysis soon and it will help with the copays. It will greatly help my children and grandchild to see the incredible kind and generous people who are willing to lend a helping hand to others. You will receive our heartfelt thanks and the satisfaction of knowing you helped a young man and his family during a very difficult time in his life. I hope it will plant seeds in my children and grandchild to pay it forward throughout their lifetime.</p>

Children of War Foundation is a non-profit 501(c) 3 entity that provides surgical and medical treatment to children throughout the world, and here in the United States.  We are a unique organization in that none of our members receive any form of financial compensation.  
  
The money needed is to help cover the cost of medical equipment, some logistical expenses for the doctors that will be operating and donating their time. It will also cover some basic legal and logistical fees for making this mission happen and the opportunity to ensure that we can operate on as many kids as possible. 

 If you would like to get more detailed information on the children we will be operating on, the mission or how you can get involved, please contact us at info@cowf.org

 
We are fortunate enough to have the following members that will be embarking on the mission, which will start June 1st.   
 Dr. MarkUrata, Chief of Plastic Surgery at University of Southern California (USC), Division Head at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles
Dr Jeffrey Hammoudeh, Director Jaw Deformities Center, USC Plastic Surgery, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles
Dr. Andrew Ordon, Plastic Surgeon, Doctors Show
Dr. Andy Chang, Pediatric Urologists, USC, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles
Dr. Andrea Panossian, Director of Vascular Anomalies, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles
Dr. Kami Parsa, Occulo Plastics, Rox Surgery

<h3>Ayurvedic Herbs?</h3>
<div>Ayurveda is a holistic healing school of thought developed in India thousands of years ago. Part of the teachings include the use of specific herbs to bring the body back into balance. Gypsy Tonic uses two elements from Ayurveda.</div>

<h3>What else?</h3>
<p> Gypsy Tonic is extremely high in antioxidants and replenishes minerals and electrolytes. <br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">     This was a tough
challenge for us from the beginning because of how important it is for us to
deliver the best quality product possible. In order to be certified organic 95%
of the ingredients have to be organic. Shilajit doesn’t come in an organic
option because it is a mineral pitch and cannot be certified organic. The same
goes for the Ionic Sea Minerals which also do not come in an organic
certifiable form. Though they aren’t certified organic, our Shilajit, Bacopa,
Ginseng and Ionic Sea Minerals are all organically harvested and very clean
ingredients. At Bohemian Revolution Beverage Co. we value integrity. This means
your health and well-being always come first! In the future if we can find an
organic substitute that is as good, or better, than a particular ingredient we
are currently using we will definitely make the change! </p>

</div><div><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">So what does it taste like?</h3></div><div><br/></div><p style=""text-align: center;"">  Gypsy Tonic has a smooth mellow chocolaty flavor with a hint of almond. Cacao (unprocessed cocoa powder) is the main ingredient in this supplement, first for its health properties, and secondly for its taste. Although there is a lot of cacao in it, Gypsy Tonic does not have an overbearing chocolate taste. And though it is not carbonated, it manages to have a tiny bit of zing in it. When combined with the other exotic ingredients, the flavor takes on a uniqueness that has layers of mystery embedded in its flavor profile.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><div>Even if you’re not a Chocolate lover, we recommend giving Gypsy Tonic a whirl. You'll probably enjoy the way you feel when drinking this unique supplement.

Tonic has been my passion for the last few years and I started making this
concoction in my house as a substitute to other forms of energy enhancing
drinks. I noticed it created a different, more subtle, more controlled form of
energy and focus as well as replenishing and boosting my nutrient levels without over-stimulating – generating a productive, creative state of mind while promoting an overall feel good vibe. </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">(Plus I tend to be a bit on the caffeine sensitive side, so it was important to find something that didn't give me a case of the jitters.)</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452481149/x0lnrw1cwejsshdfqkzo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

Awhile back one of my best friends had introduced me to some new and
exciting ingredients that got me exploring a whole new area of health and
wellness. Using some of these new ingredients from the Ayurvedic and Peruvian
modalities, and adding some of my other tried and true ingredients I use when
looking for a boost, I developed and fine tuned the first batch of Gypsy Tonic.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449126393/rfdwggmkr8mveahya6bn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

It is now my go to drink whenever I am looking to get a buzz, focus on a
project, add an extra kick to a night out (or recover from a night out), or
simply bring my spirits up when I'm having one of those ""off"" days. Sometimes I'll
just drink some to see what happens. And, of course, I still whip up a batch of Gypsy Tonic whenever I am feeling like I could use a creative boost.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">I started sharing my recipe with friends and family and got some great responses and some great feedback, which led to the idea of being able to share it with Everyone!</p><div style=""text-align: center;"">

MINI GYPSY Gift Bag
Gypsy Tonic 29/Tote-bag/T-shirt (Thank you card & sticker not pictured)
What is this Amazing
""Gypsy Tonic"" you speak of?

  Gypsy Tonic is a Revolutionary Artisan supplement that produces a unique kind
of experience when compared to other drinks on the market. It's a product that
is extremely healthy, promotes balance, uses only premium ingredients and
provides something other than a caffeine buzz to energize. It’s packed full of
Amazing components found all around the world: from exotic islands to deep
jungles, Himalayan mountains, and desert flat-lands.           We have taken the concept, class, and style of vintage tonics from the late 1800's and early 1900's and have added a modern day spin with ancient ingredients.


  The Gypsy Tonic recipe is very intentional and carefully
formulated to create an overall balanced experience. Every ingredient is
there for a reason — you take one out and it’s just not the same. It was our
goal from the beginning to not cut any corners from conception to production.
There are generous amounts of all the finest ingredients in each bottle to
ensure you get plenty of the good stuff.The lineup of Gypsy Tonic ingredients:



     All natural ingredients in their purist form. No artificial flavors, nothing Genetically Modified (Non-GMO), and no preservatives. Only the best and finest ingredients for your enjoyment!

                       
Some of the Amazing Benefits & Health properties of Gypsy Tonic:
  Gypsy Tonic is truly one of a kind. There is no one type of experience while enjoying it. Its effects are as unique as you are and benefit everyone differently. We like to say it has an individualized energy response that is specially tailored to your body! Keep reading to learn more about the amazing components that make up Gypsy Tonic! 





SuperFoods?
Superfoods are antioxidant-rich and nutrient-dense powerhouse foods that pack more of a punch than your average food item ingredient.




Ayurvedic Herbs?
Ayurveda is a holistic healing school of thought developed in India thousands of years ago. Part of the teachings include the use of specific herbs to bring the body back into balance. Gypsy Tonic uses two elements from Ayurveda.


What else?
 Gypsy Tonic is extremely high in antioxidants and replenishes minerals and electrolytes. 


Why isn't Gypsy Tonic Certified Organic?
     This was a tough
challenge for us from the beginning because of how important it is for us to
deliver the best quality product possible. In order to be certified organic 95%
of the ingredients have to be organic. Shilajit doesn’t come in an organic
option because it is a mineral pitch and cannot be certified organic. The same
goes for the Ionic Sea Minerals which also do not come in an organic
certifiable form. Though they aren’t certified organic, our Shilajit, Bacopa,
Ginseng and Ionic Sea Minerals are all organically harvested and very clean
ingredients. At Bohemian Revolution Beverage Co. we value integrity. This means
your health and well-being always come first! In the future if we can find an
organic substitute that is as good, or better, than a particular ingredient we
are currently using we will definitely make the change! 





So what does it taste like?  Gypsy Tonic has a smooth mellow chocolaty flavor with a hint of almond. Cacao (unprocessed cocoa powder) is the main ingredient in this supplement, first for its health properties, and secondly for its taste. Although there is a lot of cacao in it, Gypsy Tonic does not have an overbearing chocolate taste. And though it is not carbonated, it manages to have a tiny bit of zing in it. When combined with the other exotic ingredients, the flavor takes on a uniqueness that has layers of mystery embedded in its flavor profile.Even if you’re not a Chocolate lover, we recommend giving Gypsy Tonic a whirl. You'll probably enjoy the way you feel when drinking this unique supplement. Enjoy during the special moments of life or for everyday use!
The Story...
  Hello, friends, fellow bohemians and IndieGoGo family! My name is Brandon Johnson, at heart I am an artist and gravitate towards
playing music, dancing and writing, but truly enjoy all forms of the creative
process. I also enjoy traveling, festivals, and adventures of all sorts. I always seem to be on the go and I am excited to share with you my secret of how I keep going and keep creative.        Gypsy
Tonic has been my passion for the last few years and I started making this
concoction in my house as a substitute to other forms of energy enhancing
drinks. I noticed it created a different, more subtle, more controlled form of
energy and focus as well as replenishing and boosting my nutrient levels without over-stimulating – generating a productive, creative state of mind while promoting an overall feel good vibe. (Plus I tend to be a bit on the caffeine sensitive side, so it was important to find something that didn't give me a case of the jitters.)
 
Awhile back one of my best friends had introduced me to some new and
exciting ingredients that got me exploring a whole new area of health and
wellness. Using some of these new ingredients from the Ayurvedic and Peruvian
modalities, and adding some of my other tried and true ingredients I use when
looking for a boost, I developed and fine tuned the first batch of Gypsy Tonic.
 
It is now my go to drink whenever I am looking to get a buzz, focus on a
project, add an extra kick to a night out (or recover from a night out), or
simply bring my spirits up when I'm having one of those ""off"" days. Sometimes I'll
just drink some to see what happens. And, of course, I still whip up a batch of Gypsy Tonic whenever I am feeling like I could use a creative boost.I started sharing my recipe with friends and family and got some great responses and some great feedback, which led to the idea of being able to share it with Everyone!
Which
brings us to IndieGoGo...
It all starts here, and it starts with you!

<h3>A Healthy Billion is a Startup Ironman</h3>
<p>Three companies with three big goals for 2013/2014 come together with 1 major focus:  Building a community dedicated to working together to improve everyday health...by the billions.</p>
<p>The following projects are the 'swim, bike and run' of what we are calling a startup ironman:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>""The Swim"" :</b> <a href=""www.collegeofadaptivearts.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">College of Adaptive Arts</a>, a non-profit building an innovative college for adults with disabilities - <i>this year we need to find a permanent home for the college.  We are also working on building a professional health &amp; wellness department.</i>
</li>
<li>""<b>The Bike"" </b>:  <a href=""www.vidapost.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vidapost</a>, building a care coordination platform focused on simplifying the management of everyday care while continuously focusing on improving everyday health - <i>this year our goal is to launch our first membership program, build and test our communication platform and complete our first healthy billion challenge:  1 billion steps.</i>

</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>A Healthy Billion is a Personal Commitment</h3>
<p>While each company has their own ""event"" (and projects), their own mission and their own personal team, Jen Pleimann, has signed up for the full startup Ironman.  She is the co-chair of the College of Adaptive Arts, the founder of Vidapost and the founder of BuddiesInACTION.</p>
<p>Typically, this time of year Jen can be found riding 100 miles from Carmel to Hearst Castle and leading TeamFITBuddies in the Audi Best Buddies' Challenge but this year she has embarked on a new challenge and is asking for your support as she pursues her passion and embarks on a new professional journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>A little about Jen:</b></p>
<p>Current SF resident, originally from the midwest (St. Louis) with a dose of the east coast (Connecticut), south (South Carolina) and southwest (Oklahoma).  Jen is a University of Wisconsin-Madison grad with a BS in Psychology and a work background encompassing many health related fields and settings including:  behavioral therapist (for autism); physical therapy assistant; home health aide; and personal trainer.</p>
<p>She is a proud XXinHealth-er who has stepped away from providing care to solving everyday care problems.  She does not have a MBA, she has <a href=""http://ahealthybillion.com/about/jen-pleimann/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MORE</a>.  She is a single member founder (with a great team), an outside-the-box thinker, and an optimistic, glass is always half full kind of thinker.  And yes, she has undertaken three different endeavors but all with one main focus.</p>
<p>You can typically find Jen in workout attire with her laptop in hand (or at least nearby) and personal training a FIT in Los Altos a couple days a week.  When not working on 1 of her 3 initiatives, she enjoys working out (de-stressing), spending time with friends, supporting her boyfriend's sports addiction or singing at the top of her lungs on her commute down 280.  Although 3,000 miles away, Jen remains extremely close to her family and in fact, her sister, Tracy Richardson, is involved with both BuddiesInACTION and Vidapost.</p>
<p><b>A Message from Jen - Why this is so important to me:</b></p>
<p>It has been my everyday experiences in a variety of professional settings (homes, clinics, gyms, schools) that has led me to my current endeavors.  For me, it is not about ""what"" I am working on or ""how"" I am going to solve the problems (although of course extremely important) but what keeps me going is WHY I am doing what I am doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because I worked in the homes of individuals with chronic conditions and witnessed the day in, day out struggles of everyday caregiving and understand the disconnect between everyday care and medical care from both a professional and patient/caregiver perspective.</li>
<li>Because I have witnessed the life changing effects of professional health &amp; wellness programs for individuals with disabilities</li>
<li>Because I have watched adults with disabilities who were non-verbal, shy and disconnected from society ""find their purpose"" and become contributing citizens by taking college courses that cater to their strengths and abilities.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>A healthy billion is a personal commitment and a professional endeavor that I am calling a startup ironman.  And although I have never completed an actual Ironman, I have witnessed many and been a part of the training and I am well aware that it is an event that takes a village to complete:  participants, coaches, volunteers and so on.  Most importantly it takes community support to help cheer participants through each event and across the finish line.  The startup ironman will require the same village.</p>
<h3>A Healthy Billion is a Community Event</h3>
<p>As mentioned, the main focus of A Healthy Billion is to build a community (that includes YOU) to work together to improve health...by the billions.  We are asking for your support in the crazy ironman startup because we know that with your help, together we can cross the finish line and make a difference...by the billions.  Here's how you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Make a donation</b> (seriously, any amount helps): 20% goes to CAA, 40% to BuddiesInACTION, 40% to Vidapost.  </li>
<li>
<b>Move with us</b>:  Swim, Bike, Run, Walk and help us reach a billion steps (you can pledge $35 and we will email you a promo code or sign up directly at <a href=""http://www.vidapost.com)."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.vidapost.com).</a>  Please note we have extended the challenge past Aug. 31st and will continue until we reach 1 Billion; You may register as a 'healthy' patient if you are not a caregiver, provider and do not have a chronic condition.  Every step earns points towards health &amp; wellness services for our Ambassadors who are adults with disabilities.</li>
<li>
<b>Spread the word</b>:  Share our campaign and initiatives.  Our number 1 goal is to build our community so help us spread the word.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Most of the contribution levels are actual prices for some of our programs and services.  While we do have some tangible 'perks' (t-shirts, water bottles, etc) your contributions will go towards paying for a membership for yourself, sponsoring a friend, family or organization, or sponsoring the launch of an actual program or even a city launch!  Below is the distribution of funding and what we hope to accomplish with your contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>CAA (20%)</b>:  We hope to expand our health &amp; wellness department within CAA to offer more professional classes.  This year they also hope to establish an official college campus for our students and solidify 500K in funding.</li>
<li>
<b>BuddiesInACTION (40%)</b>:  The funds raised will go towards establishing a scholarship fund and if you sponsor an affiliate program and/or headquarters you will have the option to specify the area you would like to see the program launched.</li>
<li>
<b>Vidapost (40%)</b>:  Funds raised will support <a href=""https://www.vidapost.com/challenge"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Healthy Billion Challenge</a> and support our <a href=""http://www.buddiesinaction.com/#!ambassadors/c18du"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ambassadors</a> who are individuals with intellectual disabilities leading the challenge by both participating and sending encouraging messages to their teammates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that contributions are not tax deductive.  If you would like to contribute directly to the <a href=""www.collegeofadaptivearts.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">college of adaptive arts</a> you may make a tax deductible donation with them.  </p>
<p>As mentioned, the number one goal is building our community and understanding that we all have a role to play.  We have set up our 'perks' a little bit differently than most campaigns as we want you to be an active part of our network, building and creating with us as well as receiving.</p>

<p>1) <a href=""www.collegeofadaptivearts.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">College of Adaptive Arts (CAA)</a>:  Building an innovative college for adults with disabilities, specializing in the arts. </p>
<p>To date, programs and state funding for individuals with disabilities ends at the age of 22.

<p>At Vidapost we believe every single one of us has a role to play as a provider, as a caregiver and as a patient and that by working together, in a systematic way, we can make vast changes to improve everyday care.  We are building a care coordination platform focused on simplifying the management of everyday care with a continued focus on improving everyday health.  Today care coordination is not only scattered and disconnected but it is also only viewed as a medical problem (ie.  only includes doctors, nurses, specialist, etc).  At Vidapost, our goal is to connect the everyday providers and caregivers in a simplified way and enable the medical care team to connect to the information pertinent to their point of care.  </p>

A Healthy Billion is a Startup Ironman
Three companies with three big goals for 2013/2014 come together with 1 major focus:  Building a community dedicated to working together to improve everyday health...by the billions.
The following projects are the 'swim, bike and run' of what we are calling a startup ironman:

""The Bike"" :  Vidapost, building a care coordination platform focused on simplifying the management of everyday care while continuously focusing on improving everyday health - this year our goal is to launch our first membership program, build and test our communication platform and complete our first healthy billion challenge:  1 billion steps.


""The Run"" : BuddiesInACTION, specializing in professional health & wellness programs for teens and adults with disabilities.  - this year we are working on building a scholarship fund, offering workshops to staff and instructors on how to implement the ACTION philosophy to build inclusive wellness programs, and expanding to other cities and locations via our headquarters and affiliate programs.

You can typically find Jen in workout attire with her laptop in hand (or at least nearby) and personal training a FIT in Los Altos a couple days a week.  When not working on 1 of her 3 initiatives, she enjoys working out (de-stressing), spending time with friends, supporting her boyfriend's sports addiction or singing at the top of her lungs on her commute down 280.  Although 3,000 miles away, Jen remains extremely close to her family and in fact, her sister, Tracy Richardson, is involved with both BuddiesInACTION and Vidapost.
A Message from Jen - Why this is so important to me:
It has been my everyday experiences in a variety of professional settings (homes, clinics, gyms, schools) that has led me to my current endeavors.  For me, it is not about ""what"" I am working on or ""how"" I am going to solve the problems (although of course extremely important) but what keeps me going is WHY I am doing what I am doing:

Because I worked in the homes of individuals with chronic conditions and witnessed the day in, day out struggles of everyday caregiving and understand the disconnect between everyday care and medical care from both a professional and patient/caregiver perspective.
Because I have witnessed the life changing effects of professional health & wellness programs for individuals with disabilities
Because I have watched adults with disabilities who were non-verbal, shy and disconnected from society ""find their purpose"" and become contributing citizens by taking college courses that cater to their strengths and abilities.


A healthy billion is a personal commitment and a professional endeavor that I am calling a startup ironman.  And although I have never completed an actual Ironman, I have witnessed many and been a part of the training and I am well aware that it is an event that takes a village to complete:  participants, coaches, volunteers and so on.  Most importantly it takes community support to help cheer participants through each event and across the finish line.  The startup ironman will require the same village.
A Healthy Billion is a Community Event
As mentioned, the main focus of A Healthy Billion is to build a community (that includes YOU) to work together to improve health...by the billions.  We are asking for your support in the crazy ironman startup because we know that with your help, together we can cross the finish line and make a difference...by the billions.  Here's how you can help:


Make a donation (seriously, any amount helps): 20% goes to CAA, 40% to BuddiesInACTION, 40% to Vidapost.  

Move with us:  Swim, Bike, Run, Walk and help us reach a billion steps (you can pledge $35 and we will email you a promo code or sign up directly at www.vidapost.com).  Please note we have extended the challenge past Aug. 31st and will continue until we reach 1 Billion; You may register as a 'healthy' patient if you are not a caregiver, provider and do not have a chronic condition.  Every step earns points towards health & wellness services for our Ambassadors who are adults with disabilities.

Spread the word:  Share our campaign and initiatives.  Our number 1 goal is to build our community so help us spread the word.




What We Need & What You Get
Most of the contribution levels are actual prices for some of our programs and services.  While we do have some tangible 'perks' (t-shirts, water bottles, etc) your contributions will go towards paying for a membership for yourself, sponsoring a friend, family or organization, or sponsoring the launch of an actual program or even a city launch!  Below is the distribution of funding and what we hope to accomplish with your contributions:


CAA (20%):  We hope to expand our health & wellness department within CAA to offer more professional classes.  This year they also hope to establish an official college campus for our students and solidify 500K in funding.

BuddiesInACTION (40%):  The funds raised will go towards establishing a scholarship fund and if you sponsor an affiliate program and/or headquarters you will have the option to specify the area you would like to see the program launched.

Vidapost (40%):  Funds raised will support A Healthy Billion Challenge and support our Ambassadors who are individuals with intellectual disabilities leading the challenge by both participating and sending encouraging messages to their teammates.

Please note that contributions are not tax deductive.  If you would like to contribute directly to the college of adaptive arts you may make a tax deductible donation with them.  
As mentioned, the number one goal is building our community and understanding that we all have a role to play.  We have set up our 'perks' a little bit differently than most campaigns as we want you to be an active part of our network, building and creating with us as well as receiving.


More about the 3 Projects:
1) College of Adaptive Arts (CAA):  Building an innovative college for adults with disabilities, specializing in the arts. 
To date, programs and state funding for individuals with disabilities ends at the age of 22. Services are limited and opportunities are sparse.  The CAA's goal is to establish a college campus so they can continue growing the programs and services that enable adults with disabilities to be contributing members of society.

2) BuddiesInACTION:  Improving the health & wellness of individuals with intellectual disabilities.  
Erin Hopfinger, a fellow St. Joe Angel, recently partnered with Jen to begin growing and expanding BuddiesInACTION.  Our goal is to expand the FITBuddies' program Jen started at FIT via our affiliate program to other gyms and organizations.  We offer training and workshops for teachers, trainers and wellness instructors on how to implement the ACTION philosophy in any type of health & wellness program.  We will be launching headquarters in various cities to to establish comprehensive wellness programs and build a wider community to address all the health & wellness needs of an individual.
A Special Congrats to Red Dot Fitness, one of our initial affiliates, on launching their BuddiesInACTION program in San Jose this fall!!

3) Vidapost:  Simplifying everyday care, improving everyday health.
At Vidapost we believe every single one of us has a role to play as a provider, as a caregiver and as a patient and that by working together, in a systematic way, we can make vast changes to improve everyday care.  We are building a care coordination platform focused on simplifying the management of everyday care with a continued focus on improving everyday health.  Today care coordination is not only scattered and disconnected but it is also only viewed as a medical problem (ie.  only includes doctors, nurses, specialist, etc).  At Vidapost, our goal is to connect the everyday providers and caregivers in a simplified way and enable the medical care team to connect to the information pertinent to their point of care.

both Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Fibromyalgia (Fibro). At 32
yrs old she was diagnosed with RA and 6 months later diagnosed with
Fibromyalgia. These diseases have slowed her down tremendously.  RA is an auto-immune disease that attacks the
body’s tissues and linings of joints causing chronic pain, weakness, and
inflammation. As it progresses it can
cause severe disability, permanent joint and organ damage.  Fibromyalgia syndrome is a long-term
condition which causes pain all over the body more specifically, in the neck,
shoulders, back, hips, arms, and legs. 
It is difficult and extremely painful for her to do daily activities. I
never thought I would see her in a wheelchair or using a walker because she has
always been so active and on the go.</p>
<p><b>Y</b>emaya was a full-time student until
the chronic pain got so unbearable that she had to drop the one class she
needed to graduate.  She was a proud
homeowner in Washington, D.C. until 3 months ago. She had to temporarily move
in with family so they could help take care of her due to her debilitating illness.  As her
Father it is difficult to watch her in so much pain.  I want to make it all go away but
unfortunately I can’t.  There are times
when I want to hug her and tell her everything will be okay but her chronic pain
is so severe at times I can’t even touch her. 
So I’ve decided to focus on
getting her better care by reaching out for help because her needs are greater
than our means. Whether we meet our
funding goal or not, all donations raised from this fundraiser will go towards offsetting
her current medical and living expenses. 
</p>
<p><b>D</b>ue to her increasingly progressive
pain she was admitted to George Washington Hospital and referred to a Spine/Pain
Clinic after being discharged from the hospital. The pain clinic recommended she get a
procedure called Intravenous Lidocaine Infusion which was supposed to reduce
her pain caused by Fibromyalgia significantly, but it was declined yet again
because the insurance deemed it experimental. 
This type of treatment can average $250.00 per hour, in addition to our
out of pocket expenses which include alternative medicine, acupuncture, acupressure,
magnetic therapy, water therapy, and holistic care the cost add up quickly.</p>
<p><b>M</b>ost recently we were encouraged to seek additional care
through Johns Hopkins second opinion program. 
Johns Hopkins Hospital is rated the number one in the nation in Rheumatology
but they would not take her insurance either. 
An average cost of an initial consult appointment is around $600.  Additionally, she would need a few follow up appointments
to review lab work, prescribe medication, and monitor her results.</p>
<p><b>E</b>mployment is farfetched due to her current condition yet
when she applied for Medicaid and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) she
was denied and provided substandard state insurance that doesn’t cover the
medication and procedures needed to manage her pain.  Her doctors are running out of viable options
because the medication and procedures they prescribe/recommend are being denied
by her insurance.  Out of desperation she
applied for private insurance and was also declined for pre-existing
conditions.  Thereafter we tried to apply
for insurance using the Affordable Care Act website but was not successful either.</p>

So tack that on in addition to what we've raised here. The news nearly brought Christy to tears when I Skyped with her the next day. Thank you so much to those generous donors who contributed and all of the support you all have given to her. I know she's looking forward to the day she can get back on that dance floor! Thank you to everyone else who has donated directly to this site as well. If I don't know you already, I hope to meet you some day, you all seem like extraordinary people and I'm glad Christy has you in her life. </p>
<p>Christy is the strongest woman I know. I’m biased, because she’s my mom. But, she has taken some of the most difficult of life’s challenges all in the last few years, from divorce, the loss of her mother, the loss of pets, the loss of work, and a diagnosis of ovarian cancer. She has undergone several rounds of chemo over the past 2 years as well as a full hysterectomy. On August 7th of last year she underwent a drastic and incredibly invasive surgery, designed to seek out and remove any and all cancer throughout her abdominal region. This was one of the most stressful and trying days of my life as I waited to hear the outcome of the surgery. It’s a day I will never forget. Late that night the surgeon called and updated me on the surgery. It was much more extensive than we ever thought, removing the lining of her abdomen, her spleen, her gallbladder, parts of her intestine, and parts of her diaphragm. She was unable to speak for several days and remained in the ICU for 2 weeks. Seeing her in such pain was heart-wrenching. For a woman who was so active before the diagnosis, now unable to walk more than a lap around the nurses’ station, we wondered if we had made the right decision. The hardest part was when she would take her walks into the ICU where she had once laid unconscious for so long. At times it brought us both to tears simply being in that hall but she insisted on walking through it. There were times when patient rooms would suddenly go empty-- people less fortunate than she. I struggled to not break down into tears, telling myself that I was lucky because my mom made it out of the ICU alive. She improved slowly and eventually, tube after tube was removed, all of her staples were taken out of her abdomen, and her walks became longer. She stayed one month longer due to an infection <em>(C. difficile</em>) that occurred just days before she was scheduled to be discharged. If you can imagine an extensive abdominal surgery followed by incessant vomiting you can imagine the pain and the toll this would take you through physically and emotionally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s been nearly a year since the surgery. Her life was moving in a positive direction with the support of friends, a compassionate Dragon Boat group, a part-time job, and no sign of cancer. Although cancer loomed in her mind every day and much of her time has been spent researching cancer and doing everything she could to keep the it at bay, her outlook seemed to be a little brighter especially the last few months.  Then we received the news that her CA-125 (a biomarker for ovarian cancer) had risen to 41. Not terribly high but a jump high enough that we knew that our greatest fear was a strong possibility. This week we learned that indeed, the cancer is back. Her PET scan showed activity in areas around her liver, on her intestines, her bladder, and as high up as her clavicle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I need my mom. I want her to live as long as possible. I want her to see me graduate. I want her to be here when my husband and I have kids. I need her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My mom is incredibly independent and has made selfless sacrifices throughout her life to make sure my brother and I could have the lives that we have had. She has always put herself after others and never asks for help, even when she desperately needs it. Now is one of those times which is why I am asking for her. With your contribution she can continue to get treatment and can continue to pay her bills during the time that she cannot work, She has been receiving help from her ex-husband, my father to pay for medical insurance and has been unable to work consistently for years now due to chemotherapy treatments that not only interfere with a working schedule, but hinders her from being hired. Sadly, companies don’t like to hire people who have cancer because they can’t be sure how long they will be around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The goal for our fundraising is $20,000. This will help pay for her next treatment and would go towards the many medical bills that have built up over the past few years, as well as other treatments she may need now or in the future such as chemotherapy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In return for your generosity I would like to personally make you something. At one point in my life I painted murals for a small studio in Charleston, SC and since have continued art as a hobby. I primarily do oil paintings, pen and ink drawings, and jewelry making. In the photos section there are examples of some of my work. Subject matter varies in my paintings and drawings and jewelry is typically made with combinations of metal and stones. Being a student, my studies have kept me fairly busy and away from the arts but I always have several projects going on. I hope to truly show you my gratitude through the work that I create for you. For more detail see the “perks” section and examples uploaded into the “photos” section.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My wife and I were blessed to have our second child, a boy, on October 31st, 2011.  Unfortunately, he was in the NIC Unit for 42 days with an infection that included high fevers and loss of weight but he is now home with us getting better each day, along with a very large medical bill.  During this time I began having very painful health problems which I ignored until the pain was unbearable. I was diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia.  Although the doctor does not think it is cancerous he has advised me that if I do not get the surgery, Trans-Urethral Resection of the Prostate, there is eventually a possibility of cancer of the prostrate.  I have seen three specialists in the Sacramento area and all have given me the same diagnosis.  Sounds very simple except for the cost of the surgery and the mounting medical bills we have for our son.  Thank you for reading my story.</p>
</div><p> </p><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>I have health insurance, unlike some Americans, but my deductible is $7,500 and a 20% co-payment which is out of reach for us.  We do not have savings nor do we have credit cards.  Because this is not an emergency surgery, I need to pay the surgeon my deductible up front before they will do the surgery.  Thank you for any amount of money that you can donate towards my surgery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><font size=""3"">My Promise</font></strong></p>
<p>I will pay forward to other family's health needs.  As I told the doctors, I could make long term payments on the surgery, but none will take long term payments, so instead I can make long term payments toward other's health needs through this program.</p>

My wife and I were blessed to have our second child, a boy, on October 31st, 2011.  Unfortunately, he was in the NIC Unit for 42 days with an infection that included high fevers and loss of weight but he is now home with us getting better each day, along with a very large medical bill.  During this time I began having very painful health problems which I ignored until the pain was unbearable. I was diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia.  Although the doctor does not think it is cancerous he has advised me that if I do not get the surgery, Trans-Urethral Resection of the Prostate, there is eventually a possibility of cancer of the prostrate.  I have seen three specialists in the Sacramento area and all have given me the same diagnosis.  Sounds very simple except for the cost of the surgery and the mounting medical bills we have for our son.  Thank you for reading my story.
 
What We Need
I have health insurance, unlike some Americans, but my deductible is $7,500 and a 20% co-payment which is out of reach for us.  We do not have savings nor do we have credit cards.  Because this is not an emergency surgery, I need to pay the surgeon my deductible up front before they will do the surgery.  Thank you for any amount of money that you can donate towards my surgery.
 
My Promise
I will pay forward to other family's health needs.  As I told the doctors, I could make long term payments on the surgery, but none will take long term payments, so instead I can make long term payments toward other's health needs through this program.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our daughter Tijana Ognjanovic, aged 8, urgently needs help for treatment abroad. Having in mind really serious health condition of the sick girl, who has been diagnosed with restrictive cardiomyopathy, medical council has suggested the transplatiton to be performed as soon as possible.
<p>Having in mind that this kind of operation is not performed in our country, and Republic Institute for health insurance does not cover costs for operation and postoperative treatment of this kind of disease, left on our own, we initiated action for help to Tijana to get a new heart. For relatively short time with help of people of good will who have supported this humanitarian action, we have collected 200.000 EUR for heart transplatation and postoperative treatment in Vienna.</p>
<p>In January this year, we went to Vienna, to AKH clinic, where after detailed analysis they have informed us that clinic is not capable to put Tijana on waiting list and perform heart transplatation, because of complications which have appeared by the end of December 2012. (kidney failure) and very rare form of restrictive cardiomyopathy from which Tijana suffers. As Tijana has been classified in third risk group (there are three groups), they gave her only 2% chance to survive operation in their centre (we have enclosed <a href=""images/Pismo_sa_AKH.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">conclusion of transplantation team from AKH clinic</a>).</p>
<p>Faced with this facts and not wishing to give up, we were forced to find a clinic which has experience with this rare kind of restrictive cardiomyopathy and which would accept Tijana as high risk patient. We have contacted many cardiologists in the country and abroad and we have received data that clinics in America have most experience with this kind of cardiomyopathy, from which the child clinic in Houston has especially stood out. We have contacted them and got answer that in relatively short period we can get heart, but this kind of operation costs 1.015.000,00 $. <a href=""images/tijana_ognjanovic_deposit_estimate.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(Here you can find enclosed breakdown of estimated charges.)</a></p>
<p>Having in mind report of Tijana’s cardiologist, professor Dr Jovan Kosutic, from Institute for Mother and Child, where Tijana is being cured for six years, and at the moment our daughter is in the state of clinically poor condition, and the crucial factor in this case is time, and Tijana does not have it.</p>
<p>If Tijana’s departure to clinic to Houston is prolonged due to lack of money, it can happen that a permanent cancellation of other organs happens (kidneys, liver, lungs), which at the moment suffer the most because of weakend cardiac function, and then heart transplantation will not be possible.</p>
<p>We would like to inform You that action for help to Tijana is continued and that we still count on You and Your support which will in forthcoming period be very much needed.

<h3>Fight for Giovanni</h3>
<p>My name is Cheryl di Leonardo. Giovanni's father died of colon cancer when Giovanni was 16 months old so we are on our own for this journey. My 7 year old son contracted Lyme disease as a small baby that the dogs brought in from the field. the doctors could'nt diagnose him until he was 3 years old with such a late diagnosis the disease caused severe damage to his optical nerves and central nervous system. We had to get very aggressive with treaments to kill the Lyme bacteria and had to put him on extreamly high doses of antbiotic for 4 years to get rid of it , i had to also put him on high doses of probiotic to replace the good bacteria in his stomach that the antibiotic killed, it caused his baby teeth to turn brown but had to do this to kill this very hard to get rid of Lyme disease, the Lyme caused Giovanni to go almost completly blind and caused cerebral palsy and autistic characteristics. He cannot talk yet , walks with a sever limp and cannot run. After extensive research, i know stem cell transfusion is the only way to help my son to correct the scare tissue damage Lyme caused him,these treatment are only in the research stage in the U.S and will take many years to be approved here, and will be very costly when we do get it, many countries do this now Giovanni's case has been accepted for stem cell transfusions at Shenzen Beike Hospitols in China for Sep.- Oct. 2013 for 30 days of treatment, the Doctors will be using umbilical cord stem cells plus rehabilitation therapies everyday-accupuncture, phyical therapy, pressure point massage and more. All of these treatment will give my little boy the best chance to live a normal life. I am happy to say we have raised $10,000.00 through a fund raiser dinner i put on but time is running close to our approved date and may have to pospone our trip till a later date,and fly in the bad weather, i will continue this journey until we can raise the funds to get him there. Thank you so much for listening to his story and for anything you can do to help us, sincerly Giovanni's mom</p>

<h2>The Diagnosis</h2>
<p>The last few months have been increasingly difficult for my family as Veronica has had her gallbladder removed and had surgery in both her abdomen and right <a href=""http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/St-Wr/Thoracotomy.html#b"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">thoracic cavity</a> for adhesions and scar tissue. Her liver is no longer doing well, due to all the stress, which means her body is unable to detox--causing her heart to race. As a result, Veronica is now on a liquid/soup diet, in an attempt to restore her liver since it cannot process food or vitamins any longer.</p>
<h2>The Old Fashioned Way</h2>
<p>Since all the funds raised from this campaign will go directly to Veronica's medical bills, I decided to opt out of the ""perks"" option. Maybe it's a little old fashioned--donating while expecting nothing in return--but ""old fashioned"" is how we do it in <a href=""http://www.ci.fergus-falls.mn.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rural MN</a>! (Which is why the ""Hollywood Girl"" is creating this online campaign!)</p>

<p>I'm grateful that this community has taught me the importance of relying on one another and bearing each other's burdens--every word of encouragement, prayer, and small donation will go a long way! Thanks for being a part of my life and caring for my family (even if you've never met them).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Hope For The Future</h2>
<p>I believe in hope and I believe in a future for Veronica. So many of you have been lifting Veronica up in prayer and I couldn't be more thankful. I believe there is healing available if it's in God's plan. Please consider contributing financially or keep lifting Veronica up in prayer. I do believe that God yearns for us to pray and wants that relationship with each and every one of us--I would be honored if you would join with me in this hope.</p>

<p><strong>A Letter From Mike</strong></p>
<p><span class=""userContent"">I want folks to understand something.  Believe it or not me wanting this surgery for my health is only a small portion.  I figure that I am here in this world and unlike some I want to be productive.  And on any given day I don't make it past 8 pm.  Weekends I barely remember due to the fatigue and drain not to mention leg,ankle, knee, feet and hip pain that they can't prescribe me a dosage that touches it.  But with all this my main reason to stick around is my friends and family.  Not that I feel I am important you see.... but some of you do.  And one thing that hurts me most is to see others hurt cause of me.  Since I was a teen I always have felt I was out here to listen, fix, help, teach and even protect from others and themselves.  So I just wanted you who may read this know that whatever help you give will not be wasted.  I will do my damndest to continue being who I am and make the change count and last.  Thank you for your time...  FITZ</span></p>

But Mikey from the bottom of my Soul you are and your experiences have made me into the person I have become.

We are also interested in clinics or doctors willing to donate their services.
We have several tiers of donation possibilities thanks to contributions from our community.

A Letter From Mike
I want folks to understand something.  Believe it or not me wanting this surgery for my health is only a small portion.  I figure that I am here in this world and unlike some I want to be productive.  And on any given day I don't make it past 8 pm.  Weekends I barely remember due to the fatigue and drain not to mention leg,ankle, knee, feet and hip pain that they can't prescribe me a dosage that touches it.  But with all this my main reason to stick around is my friends and family.  Not that I feel I am important you see.... but some of you do.  And one thing that hurts me most is to see others hurt cause of me.  Since I was a teen I always have felt I was out here to listen, fix, help, teach and even protect from others and themselves.  So I just wanted you who may read this know that whatever help you give will not be wasted.  I will do my damndest to continue being who I am and make the change count and last.  Thank you for your time...  FITZ
A Letter From A Childhood Friend
Mike you have been an inspiration to me my whole journey in this thing called life. For you that don't know Mike and I were best friends in our child hood day's. From the time we could speak and maybe before. I saw your hard times and was there for the bulling that you took. But Mikey from the bottom of my Soul you are and your experiences have made me into the person I have become. Just like our Journey's we would go on together as  children I am on the ship with you now. I was there when you came home surgery after surgery and they said you would never walk but together I remember us running a few times. Never and I repeat Never hit a bird house with a bat you never know what is inside. I am going to share this page and help every way I can your Friend and brother.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>This fund-raiser is to assist my big brother, Daniel, with his treatment in his fight against cancer. He is 31 years-old and has cancer of the parotid gland which is a type of salivary gland cancer. He has already underwent extensive surgery to remove the tumor that was wrapped within the main facial nerve near his right ear. He is now going through radiation therapy everyday for the next six weeks. The treatment has made it impossible for him to work in his job as a field biologist with the University of Florida. This loss of work has made it especially difficult financially because he has no paid sick days. Daniel and his wife are under constant strain to make ends meet and this fund is an attempt to ease some of the burden on he and his family.</h3>
<h3>We are casting a wide net attempting to get a large amount of small donations. Little ripples can make big waves! Please give what you can and keep Daniel and his family in your thoughts and prayers!</h3>

<p>is an internationally-acclaimed and award-winning essayist, poet, musicologist, scholar, and translator of Polish, Hebrew, Russian, Ukrainian and Belorussian literature. He's widely published in Israel and has translated works by important authors such as Marek Krajewski, Jacek Dehnel, Julian Tuwim, Adam Zagajewski and Ewa Lipska and as such has helped bridge together Polish and Israeli cultures, among others. An Israeli of Polish origins, he currently resides in Warsaw, Poland.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HE NEEDS YOUR HELP</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>because he suffers from a rare, chronic, and fatal illness of the blood vessels known as Takayasu's Disease. This disease causes a serious disturbance to the body's blood circulation, especially to the limbs and internal organs, and can lead to amputation of the limbs, loss of eyesight, and in its final stage, death by stroke or brain hemmorrhage. Takayasu's is also physically painful, causing arm and leg weakness or pain with use. Over a year ago, Gerus took a turn for the worse, and he is no longer able to walk; he has also had trouble with his kidneys and heart, as well as diabetes. He finds himself living away from his family because doctors informed him the climate in Europe is better for his illness:</p>
<p>“I live in Warsaw by necessity, not because I deal with Polish culture,” he says. “I am completely alone. I have no family. I need all the help I can get. I find myself in a situation of total helplessness. Most of the time I’m unable to leave the house” (Ha'aretz).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE MEDICAL COSTS </strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>associated with Takayasu's are enormous at over $3,000 per month. This figure includes Gerus's medical care, medication, and in-home assistance. It allows his illness to be stabilized and prolongs his life such that he can carry out his important work that has seen no equal in Israel and the world.</p>

<p><strong><br/></strong>beyond easing the symptoms and extending Gerus's life, your donation benefits first-rate cultural, artistic, and scholarly endeavors. It is especially important with regard to strained Polish-Jewish cultural connections.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Imagine having to walk a great distance to get water for your family of five. Then imagine getting there and having to decide if you or your neighbors are the lucky ones to get water for the next four days--the same water which will feed and bathe your family and crops.</p>
<p>Water is arguably the most important natural resource to sustain life. Of all the planet's renewable resources, water may be the most unforgiving. Difficult to purify, expensive to transport, and impossible to substitute, water is essential to public health and sanitation, food production, to economic development, and to sustain life itself. </p>
<p>Here in India, the water shortage is noticable as you walk through the slums and see families lined up with their empty buckets. The visceral fear shows in the eyes of the community when they have to decide which families get water for the next 4 days, and which don't. Those who don't get it have to pay excessive amounts of their precious money stores, walk or bike for a few hours daily (taking them away from income-earning opportunities or putting them at risk for health and safety problems), or go without.</p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Last year, HELP International's India team helped construct a single bore well in one Hyderabad slum to provide access to clean water. Through our partner, SAPID, who has worked in the slums for over 7 years, we have identified 5 more slums who need bore wells. When all 5 are constructed, over 6,000 individiuals will have access to clean water.</p>
<p>These families, most of whom don't make more than $50 a month, have decided that this is their first priority and have started gathering funds to provide a well for themselves. In fact, <strong>they have raised more than half of the costs</strong> to provide for the entire cost of: </p>
<ul>
<li>the pump/motor</li>
<li>the construction of the tank</li>
<li>necessary piping and electrical connections</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All we are going to do on our end is provide for the drilling of the 5 bore wells (total of $4,500 for all 5), and <em>the community will provide the rest</em>.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>We have already had a geologist survey and identify the most successful locations for drilling of water. Our partner, SAPID, has already negotiated good prices through the drilling company if we can do all 5 on consecutive days. All we have left to do is raise the funds for our portion of the bore well.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is more than just building 5 bore wells in Hyderabad slums. Last year's bore well has brought the community together to work in unity. They have created and appointed a bore well committee that takes care of their equipment and precious stores of water. They have learned that if they work together, they can pool together money for the greater good of the community. This project is <em>empowering</em>, and <em>sustainable</em>.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Amy Hildreth, I am A 27 year old photographer from Boston. In 2008 I was diagnosed with Lyme Disease, as a result of poor diagnostics and a heavy dose of antibiotics, my teeth began to deteriorate from the inside out. When i was just 23 years old, i had my first 4 teeth pulled. From there it became almost bi monthly that i was having a tooth pulled or some sort of procedure to try to stop the pain of having my teeth fall out. I am currently in the middle of having full implants, procedures that included, bone grafting, sinus lift, metal posts implanted into my lower jaw and having dentures made. All of this already costing somewhere around $25,000. I need almost another $40,000 to finish this whole thing. As you can imagine this is a huge undertaking and my father, the hero that he is, has done everything he can up to this point to make sure this horrible time in my life has gone as smoothly as possible. We are unfortunately at the point where we can't do it alone and I am now here to ask for your help.</p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>All the money you donate will go immediately to help me have my next surgery, having 8 metal posts implanted into my top jaw, as well as helping me FINALLY getting my implants! It has been a very long time since i could bite into an apple, eat steak or have a sandwich. Without help, it will be years until i can finally put this behind me. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am asking for $38,000, this is the quote they have given me to have this whole thing finished. The next surgery is going to cost at least $9,000. A procedure that i am hoping to have done before the summer kicks in so i can actually enjoy this summer unlike the past 3! I am not asking for big donations from a few people, i am only hoping for small donations from everyone. Every single dollar helps me to get closer to having my smile back!</p>

<h3>HELLO EVERYONE,</h3>
<p>My name is Sandra Tran and on January 2nd, 2017 I found out that I have been selected to represent for Team USA at the International Powerlifting Federation World Championships in Minsk, Belarus. I will be leaving June 14th, 2017. I want to thank everyone that has been by my side since day one. Thank you for the unconditional love and supports that got me this far. Without the support that I have, I would not be where I am today.</p>

</div></div>","HELLO EVERYONE,
My name is Sandra Tran and on January 2nd, 2017 I found out that I have been selected to represent for Team USA at the International Powerlifting Federation World Championships in Minsk, Belarus. I will be leaving June 14th, 2017. I want to thank everyone that has been by my side since day one. Thank you for the unconditional love and supports that got me this far. Without the support that I have, I would not be where I am today.
