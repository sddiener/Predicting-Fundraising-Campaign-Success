<p>I recently graduated from Bennington College in the US. I study social sciences, and music, with an emphasis on public action and conflict resolution. The question of how arts, specifically documentary songwriting and music, can create social change in societies and help in conflict transformation processes, community building/development and creating solutions for social problems has become central to my education at Bennington College.</p>
<p>When I visited Cyprus for a short period of time last summer, I found “Home for Cooperation” organization. I immediately communicated with people in charge and told my peace project ideas. Last winter, I did my internship at Home for Cooperation and initiated my project which is called ""Songs Across Boundaries.""</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to collect stories from both Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots about the friendship, neighborhood, marriage relationships and solidarity between these two communities before and after the separation of the island, create lyrics from these stories and then compose these songs. I have made 10 compositions from the stories I collected during my internship. We will give concerts, consisting of these songs, on 5th of September in Ataturk Kultur Merkezi in Nicosia and on 6th of September in Home for Cooperation at the buffer zone in Nicosia. If we can find enough support, we desire to record these songs in the recording studio.</p>
<p>In order to complete the project successfully, we need $ 2.500  for the recording studio, preparing CDs, concert expenses and promotion of the project.</p>
<p>The project aims to show the ways that music and arts can contribute peacebuilding efforts and create deeper awareness of major problems in the island life. Alienation is a basic aspect of a culture of violence, which derives from the preservation of social structures in Cyprus and elsewhere that maintain perceptions and attitudes against basic human values, such as the acceptance of diversity, intercultural respect, reconciliation and solidarity. The project's imperative is to recognize the problem and to plan innovative actions, in order to construct bridges across the existing divides and barriers (physical, psychological, mental etc.). Stories always play an important role in conveying people’s emotions and thoughts and that’s why it is our responsibility to find these stories about people’s common past, and their island life and convey them in a most effective way. Music, as one of the more powerful tools in conveying emotions and experiences, will make these stories more meaningful where people can access the original songs anytime, realize there are so many different types of stories about these communities’ relationship with each other and learn how to respect the other culture. The project has two main purposes: One is to show the importance of collaboration and to bring people from Turkish Cypriot community and Greek Cypriot community together in a safe and welcoming environment where they can spend some time with each other, can learn each other’s songs and lyrics and create deeper bonds. The second aim is to reach out to more people in other countries through songs in order to create deeper awareness about the sensitive issues of Cyprus. It is envisioned that this project will assist in construction of new meanings and will become symbolic in the sense that it will suggest a paradigm shift in the society.</p>
<p>The documentary song I shared above ""Suli and I"" is told by a Greek Cypriot woman which is about a childhood friendship with a Turkish Cypriot family (you can find the lyrics below the video).</p>
<p>If you can share this project on social media platforms and support me, you will help this project to come true and  contribute to to the achievement of the project. </p>

The goal of this campaign is to collect and/or purchase backpacks and supplies to fill them in order to give them out as outreach tools and to help people experiencing homelessness, with a focus on veterans. This campaign ends on Nov. 11th - Veterans day and then we will purchase items and fill the backpacks to have ready for the first week of December.  My name is Steve Conrad and I have worked in the non-profit field for 18 years - first with abused children ages 11-17 in a residential care facility and most recently at the Human Services Campus - a campus of over 15 agencies dedicated to ending homelessness. This campaign is aimed and helping end homelessness for veterans because I believe no person who risked their life to defend this country and the people in it should be left to fend for themselves on the streets. This backpack drive may seem like just a small action but by supplying an outreach team with backpacks filled with blankets, toiletries, water, and other survival items, they can build a rapport with those experiencing homelessness and can engage and hopefully get a person off the streets and into services to help them end their homelessness.
   What We Need & What You Get  Our goal is $1,000.00 in funding which can supply 100 filled backpacks. I know many campaigns have shirts and mugs and other perks but we would like 100% of the funds raised to go to homeless veterans and others experiencing homelessness. We will write you with our sincere thanks and keep you updated on our progress through photos and videos. We are hoping to get lots of items donated, as well, so every dollar will just help us provide more backpacks and essential survival items. If we go over our goal, we will just get that many more backpacks and items.
If you are like me you might be conflicted when you see someone standing on a corner begging for money. You may want to give but not know if you would truly be helping the person. This is a way to know that you are doing something to help and not just a temporary fix but a real possibility and helping end that persons homelessness.    Let's help end homelessness for Veterans  Every dollar given will help someone experiencing homelessness and help them get essential services, too, by giving outreach members a way to engage with someone experiencing homelessness. The organization we work with each each is Madison Street Veterans Association, a nationally recognized program that won the ""Champion of change award"" from the President in 2011. While ""ending homelessness"" is a lofty and seemingly unobtainable goal, it is possible to end homelessness one person at a time and that is the focus of this campaign. Engage someone living on the streets, offer them services such as job searches, new clothes, showers, and shelter. We would like to help get people back on their feet until they can stand for themselves. 


    Other Ways You Can Help Even if you cannot contribute money at this time we need help with the following:  Getting backpacks, toiletries (shampoo, soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste, combs, etc.), and water bottles (refillable) donated. Helping to stuff the backpacks with all of the items in assembly line fashion.

<p><strong>Latest LGBT+, the UK’s first terrestrial LGBT TV channel</strong></p>
<p>Beginning in February 2017 we’ll be bringing the best in LGBT news and entertainment to our viewers TV screens.</p>
<p>Initially broadcasting for an hour a day on Freeview and Virgin Media in the Sussex area as well as globally online our aim is to continue to grow our coverage and raise awareness of LGBT issues as well as entertaining our viewers.</p>
<p>The world is changing, and not always for the better, throughout the world there is an ever increasing wave of bigotry and prejudice,  barely a week goes by without some kind of misleading, negative story.</p>
<p>As a respected local television broadcaster, Latest TV are the best TV channel to deliver on this project with two National Diversity Award nominations between channel head Sophie Cook and our CEO Bill Smith.</p>
<p>And with the talented team including Sophie Cook and creative director Andrew Kay, we have the credibility and talent to create a channel to be proud of, and with your help, we will.</p>
<p>Continuing the journey that began two years ago with the creation of Brighton’s TV channel, Latest TV, and diversified with the appointment of Sophie to the news team in June 2016, becoming Europe’s first transgender newscaster, we are now ready to bring you Latest LGBT+.</p>
<p>In the same way that BBC channels might switch over to BBC News 24 at certain times of the day so Latest TV will hand control of Freeview channel 7 and Virgin Media 159 over to Latest LGBT+ for our own brand of inclusive broadcasting, spreading the message of equality and diversity directly into people’s homes.</p>
<p>We’re different to a lot of the LGBT coverage that you’ll see on other broadcasters, being members of the community our programming will never be voyeuristic, exploitative or sensationalist.</p>
<p>Our core concepts are ones that inform all of our content decisions in that everything we show should entertain, educate or inspire our viewers, and if it does all three at the same time that’s even better.</p>
<p>And being a small organisation we listen to you, our viewers, giving us the advantage of being community led and allowing us the opportunity to give a voice to those that are often denied one.</p>
<p>So how can we do this?</p>
<p>We’ve already been broadcasting as Latest TV to the greater Brighton region for two years bringing our viewers a great mix of news, films, sports and entertainment.</p>
<p>We create great, high quality, programming with a number of our shows having been bought and distributed globally including to the BBC and Amazon Prime.</p>
<p>And we provide a platform for LGBT filmmakers to share their work, giving them access to an audience that was, until now, unavailable to them.</p>
<p>People power can change the world from the ground up and help to combat prejudice and injustice wherever it may appear.</p>
<p>We can inform policy rather than simply report on it.</p>
<p>But, I hear you ask, why would a TV company need to raise funds, surely they’re all massive corporations dripping in cash?</p>
<p>Until now that could have been true for TV broadcasters in the UK, with the commercial stations being supported by major advertising revenues and the BBC receiving government funding in the form of the TV license fee.</p>
<p>We receive NO ongoing government funding at all.</p>
<p>We’re different, we’re more like the American model of PBS television in that our funding comes from a variety of sources including advertising, corporate sponsorships, grants and you, our viewers.</p>

<p>Sunday Kickabout is free to play for all.  Financial means are not a barrier to entry for our players, and we don't collect fees on the field.  However, Kickabout does cost money.</p>
<p>Unlike many other pickup games in Seattle, our pickup games take place on reserved, high quality turf fields, mostly on Capitol Hill.  We think that providing an event in a safe, guaranteed venue helps avoid scheduling chaos and provides participants with a quality, fun experience.  That said, reserving fields with the City of Seattle is not inexpensive.  The several thousand dollars of field fees paid by kickabout each year constitute our only expense -- and one that is paid for by those who attend.</p>

<p>It's likely that several thousand players have visited and enjoyed Kickabout over the years.  Probably several hundred have found their way from our pickup games to play on other teams for our parent club, Rain City Soccer.  Most importantly though, Seattle Kickabout is the only explicitly LGBT-positive open soccer game in the city -- and we want to keep it going.</p>

<p>Two ways:  </p>
<p>1.  If you're able, please give!  Money collected through this campaign will go straight to paying our only expense for spring and summer -- field costs.</p>
<p>2.  If you can't give, come out to Kickabout anyway!  It's super-fun and we'd love to see you there.</p>

Free to play, but not free

Sunday Kickabout is free to play for all.  Financial means are not a barrier to entry for our players, and we don't collect fees on the field.  However, Kickabout does cost money.
Unlike many other pickup games in Seattle, our pickup games take place on reserved, high quality turf fields, mostly on Capitol Hill.  We think that providing an event in a safe, guaranteed venue helps avoid scheduling chaos and provides participants with a quality, fun experience.  That said, reserving fields with the City of Seattle is not inexpensive.  The several thousand dollars of field fees paid by kickabout each year constitute our only expense -- and one that is paid for by those who attend.

 Why it matters

It's likely that several thousand players have visited and enjoyed Kickabout over the years.  Probably several hundred have found their way from our pickup games to play on other teams for our parent club, Rain City Soccer.  Most importantly though, Seattle Kickabout is the only explicitly LGBT-positive open soccer game in the city -- and we want to keep it going.

 How you can help
Two ways:  
1.  If you're able, please give!  Money collected through this campaign will go straight to paying our only expense for spring and summer -- field costs.
2.  If you can't give, come out to Kickabout anyway!  It's super-fun and we'd love to see you there.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Who, what &amp; why?</h3>
<p>We are a group of artists, social and youth workers with diverse artistic, social and management experience. What unites us is the belief that we can make a difference.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/timisoararefugeeartfestival/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Timișoara Refugee Art Festival</strong></a> started in 2017 as a mix of diverse forms of artistic expression, with the purpose of bringing into discussion forced migration at a national and international level, as well as bringing the host community closer to the refugee community. <strong>TRAF 2018</strong> builds on the first edition, focusing on the theme of ”Subjectification”, a theme looking to encourage positive models in order to react towards objectification through understanding, empathy and trust.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518373412/vp34twz77jheimy31rhc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our goal is to create the framework for a constructive dialogue between people, to participate in the creation of solid, responsible and conscious communities, to provide members of these communities with the confidence to engage actively in community life and with a safe space to make their voice heard. </p>
<p>With your contribution, we can stay independent and true to our values. <strong>TRAF 2018</strong> will consist of film and music videos screenings, concerts, exhibitions and theatre shows of local and international artists, together with educational activities for children and teenagers and an academic conference.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518372865/tmpq9b7xwydgdr4t2f6h.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why we need you?</h3>
<p>The $ 10.000 budget we are asking you for will cover just about half of the total costs of the festival. Besides this, we already secured funding from various donors and sponsors for an arts camp with 20 young refugees and non refugees, local and national artists performances, the academic and educational section, an international short film selection, location rental and other production costs. So here is how we will spend the money we're asking you for: </p>
<p>$2.000 for theatre, storytelling and visual arts workshops with a group of young refugees and non refugees together.</p>
<p>$3.000 for inviting one or two refugee arts groups from abroad (a theatre group from Berlin and some musicians from EU or Turkey).</p>
<p>$2.000 for production costs - sound, lights and props.</p>
<p>$1.000 for promoting the festival (design, prints and online)</p>
<p>$1.000 for management costs</p>
<p>$1.000 for campaign fees and perks</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518372921/r5ysaicmvswlnelgkxcu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are determined to make this festival happen no matter the costs, that's why we set up a flexible goal campaign. Depending on how much we manage to raise with your support, there will be more events and artists involved in this project. By the way, check out our special perks and make sure you get yours before they run out! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>In 2017, TRAF gathered more than 300 people together as a statement for tolerance, trust, respect and solidarity. Have a glimpse of last year's edition here: </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/qspWdStwHUA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Through your contribution, not only you can help us make this happen, but you also become part of a community that shares these values. The more of us come together, the stronger and more visible we get!</p>
<p>Although TRAF takes place in Timisoara, Romania and it addresses directly only the local community, the previous edition had a high visibility at a national level in Romania and was recommended as a good practice model by the Creative Europe program and by several other partner organizations in Hungary, Bulgaria, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Cyprus and Belgium.</p>

</div></div>","Who, what & why?
We are a group of artists, social and youth workers with diverse artistic, social and management experience. What unites us is the belief that we can make a difference.
Timișoara Refugee Art Festival started in 2017 as a mix of diverse forms of artistic expression, with the purpose of bringing into discussion forced migration at a national and international level, as well as bringing the host community closer to the refugee community. TRAF 2018 builds on the first edition, focusing on the theme of ”Subjectification”, a theme looking to encourage positive models in order to react towards objectification through understanding, empathy and trust.

Our goal is to create the framework for a constructive dialogue between people, to participate in the creation of solid, responsible and conscious communities, to provide members of these communities with the confidence to engage actively in community life and with a safe space to make their voice heard. 
With your contribution, we can stay independent and true to our values. TRAF 2018 will consist of film and music videos screenings, concerts, exhibitions and theatre shows of local and international artists, together with educational activities for children and teenagers and an academic conference.


Why we need you?
The $ 10.000 budget we are asking you for will cover just about half of the total costs of the festival. Besides this, we already secured funding from various donors and sponsors for an arts camp with 20 young refugees and non refugees, local and national artists performances, the academic and educational section, an international short film selection, location rental and other production costs. So here is how we will spend the money we're asking you for: 
$2.000 for theatre, storytelling and visual arts workshops with a group of young refugees and non refugees together.
$3.000 for inviting one or two refugee arts groups from abroad (a theatre group from Berlin and some musicians from EU or Turkey).
$2.000 for production costs - sound, lights and props.
$1.000 for promoting the festival (design, prints and online)
$1.000 for management costs
$1.000 for campaign fees and perks

We are determined to make this festival happen no matter the costs, that's why we set up a flexible goal campaign. Depending on how much we manage to raise with your support, there will be more events and artists involved in this project. By the way, check out our special perks and make sure you get yours before they run out! 

Impact
In 2017, TRAF gathered more than 300 people together as a statement for tolerance, trust, respect and solidarity. Have a glimpse of last year's edition here: 

 
Through your contribution, not only you can help us make this happen, but you also become part of a community that shares these values. The more of us come together, the stronger and more visible we get!
Although TRAF takes place in Timisoara, Romania and it addresses directly only the local community, the previous edition had a high visibility at a national level in Romania and was recommended as a good practice model by the Creative Europe program and by several other partner organizations in Hungary, Bulgaria, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Cyprus and Belgium.

With your contribution we can make this project relevant to the international community and raise awareness on its importance worldwide. We are open to partner with groups and organizations from all over the world in order to create a global movement that understands and supports the moving nature of human beings. In the end, we are the most dynamic species on planet earth, as humans inhabit every corner of the globe.

<p>Millions of refugees have left Afghanistan. Many live in hardship in Pakistan, Iran, others try to reach Europe. We know that some do not make it. For those who reach Greece, many are detained. They can be in detention for months, even if they have a health problem. Even if they apply for asylum they can find it hard to be released because they have no permanent address. Yet there is usually no possibility of return to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>There are also many women and children from Afghanistan who arrive in Greece alone and end up destitute and living on the streets.</p>
<p>We want to help. </p>
<p>We want to provide short term accommodation, for a month. A place to rest, wash, play, come to terms with the journey and try to get a foothold for the next important steps in life. </p>
<p>We will help those who wish to stay in Greece to register, sort out their documents, help them contact relatives in Europe, plan for their future. </p>

</div><div> <p>This is the first push in our Campaign. We are aiming to raise £500.</p>
<p>We are already helping one family per month from donations collected locally in the UK. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">An extra £500 will allow us to help at least two families in May and another two in June with a month's accommodation, advice and support. </span></p>
<p>In the longer term, we want to have our own Guesthouse for refugees from Afghanistan in Greece. </p>
<p>We can rent a premises and help up to 8 refugees from Afghanistan per month for just 1,000 Euros per month. We are sure that once you see the benefits of our Guesthouse for the individuals we help, you will agree, and we can achieve this together! </p>
<p>The major perk is that you get to change an individual's life at a crucial moment for them. </p>
<p>If you are a woman living on the streets in Greece with small children, a month's accommodation and help to register and find support in Greece or from family overseas can literally be the difference between life and death for you and your family. </p>
<p>If you are a young man who left Afghanistan because it wasn't safe for you, if you faced danger and death to find a better life, and you have been behind bars for months and do not know when you will be released, or if you have just been released and  you have nowhere to go, a shower, a bed and a chat can mean the world.</p>
<p>We do have other perks too, of course. See our Perks page for more information.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary The European Campaign for Human Rights for the people of Afghanistan (ECHRA) promotes and defends the human rights of the people of Afghanistan wherever they are. 
Millions of refugees have left Afghanistan. Many live in hardship in Pakistan, Iran, others try to reach Europe. We know that some do not make it. For those who reach Greece, many are detained. They can be in detention for months, even if they have a health problem. Even if they apply for asylum they can find it hard to be released because they have no permanent address. Yet there is usually no possibility of return to Afghanistan.
There are also many women and children from Afghanistan who arrive in Greece alone and end up destitute and living on the streets.
We want to help. 
We want to provide short term accommodation, for a month. A place to rest, wash, play, come to terms with the journey and try to get a foothold for the next important steps in life. 
We will help those who wish to stay in Greece to register, sort out their documents, help them contact relatives in Europe, plan for their future. 
#GREEKGUESTHOUSE                                          #LETSHELPEACHOTHER
What We Need & What You Get
 This is the first push in our Campaign. We are aiming to raise £500.
We are already helping one family per month from donations collected locally in the UK. 
An extra £500 will allow us to help at least two families in May and another two in June with a month's accommodation, advice and support. 
In the longer term, we want to have our own Guesthouse for refugees from Afghanistan in Greece. 
We can rent a premises and help up to 8 refugees from Afghanistan per month for just 1,000 Euros per month. We are sure that once you see the benefits of our Guesthouse for the individuals we help, you will agree, and we can achieve this together! 
The major perk is that you get to change an individual's life at a crucial moment for them. 
If you are a woman living on the streets in Greece with small children, a month's accommodation and help to register and find support in Greece or from family overseas can literally be the difference between life and death for you and your family. 
If you are a young man who left Afghanistan because it wasn't safe for you, if you faced danger and death to find a better life, and you have been behind bars for months and do not know when you will be released, or if you have just been released and  you have nowhere to go, a shower, a bed and a chat can mean the world.
We do have other perks too, of course. See our Perks page for more information.
Finally, if we do not receive £500, then we can still use all the money raised to help people - however small. It costs around 100 Euros to provide a room for a month so however much or little you are able to donate, every single penny/cent will be used to help refugees from Afghanistan who need a helping hand to take their first steps towards a better future. 
The Impact
 We started helping refugees from Afghanistan through our Greek Guesthouse in December. 
Zahara's family was the first we helped. Zahara and her three children had nowhere to go. She and one child became ill and had to go to hospital whilst her two other children stayed with another refugee family. When she was released from hospital we provided accommodation for her family for a month so they had somewhere warm and safe. We helped her get in touch with her family in Germany who were able to help her further.
We have also been helping Ferishta. Ferishta managed to get to Greece against all the odds with her four children nearly 7 years ago. She applied for asylum under the old system and is still waiting for it to be processed. Three of her children are minors and in care in different places in Greece. She and her 15 year old son were homeless. She is working at the market for 5 Euros a day. Her husband is in a second EU country but he has had his fingerprints taken in a third, and is fighting deportation. So it is unclear if she will be able to join him, or where that may be or when. With a room and somewhere stable to live, she can visit her children and start to think about rebuilding her life.
Every 100 Euros we raise will mean we can help another family.
    Risks & Challenges I suppose you may think that a month's accommodation is not enough, or that we are only helping small numbers of people. You are right, but we are doing what we can and that is important. Every person we help off the streets is a person who has a chance to go on to build a better future for themselves, their children, their family, Europe and Afghanistan. You can help us give that chance with any donation, however small.
There is a challenge that people will not be able to move on after a month. We are helping the most needy so in some cases it will not be possible to help people find other sources of support in that time. Do not worry, we are not in the business of returning people to the streets.

<h3>These Trees Are Made of Blood</h3>
<p>We are the co-creators of These Trees Are Made of Blood, a piece of political-cabaret theatre that reimagines life under the brutal right-wing dictatorship of Argentina during the 1970's and 80's, during which an estimated 30,000 ""subversives"" were Disappeared in a concerted act of state-sponsored terrorism. The story is based upon the real-life struggles of Las Madres de Plaza de Mayo (The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo) who risked daily persecution, torture and death to fight for justice for their Disappeared children. Their story is one of ordinary people whose extraordinary courage eventually led to the fall of one of the most notorious dictatorships in history.</p>

<p>We have been working on this piece since Director Amy Draper originally brought us together in 2012 to begin workshopping ideas for the show.

<p>We have now been given an incredible chance to remount the production this summer for a 4-week run at The Arcola Theatre, one of London's finest Off-West End venues. Developing a piece of theatre like this takes considerable time and money, and we are fortunate that the Arcola Theatre is providing alot of support for the production.

<h3>How much do we need and where will your money go?</h3>
<p>We are aiming to raise a total of £7,500 which will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reworking the script, songs and story for the revised version of the show.</li>
<li>Set Design so that the designer can most effectively reimagine the show for the main house at The Arcola Theatre</li>
<li>A movement director who will help us create some stunning visual images as part of the show.</li>
</ul>

How much do we need and where will your money go?
We are aiming to raise a total of £7,500 which will go towards:

Reworking the script, songs and story for the revised version of the show.
Set Design so that the designer can most effectively reimagine the show for the main house at The Arcola Theatre
A movement director who will help us create some stunning visual images as part of the show.


Other ways you can help
We appreciate that for many of you it won't be the right time to donate financially, but you can certainly still help us out! If you believe that the project is worth shouting about then please do... this is by far the most important thing you can do to help ensure that we reach our target... 

Tweet about the campaign using the link on this page and @thesetreesshow #thesetrees
Share it on Facebook and Instagram
Tell your parents, grandparents, friends and distant relatives about the project. Again, even if they don't have the means to support us, they might know someone who does...
Put us in touch with any contacts in the press and any friends who blog regularly.
Put us in touch with anyone you think might be able to help us.

Thank you to one and all who (in whatever way) help us to rework this show so that we can tell the incredible story of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo in the way it deserves to be told. Our enormous thanks go to the Arcola Theatre for providing us with this incredible opportunity to bring this story to a wider audience.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We didn’t start Yabal because we thought there was an urgent need for more textile accessories in the market... instead, Yabal began because there was a need for <i>jobs</i>, specifically in two rural communities in the highlands of Guatemala that had been displaced during Hurricane Stan in 2005. These communities have high rates of illiteracy, very few job skills, are rurally isolated, and most of all, they do not own their own farmland, thus they depend on money to buy all their food and basic needs.</p>
<p>But… they are also communities that have a rich 5,000 year-old weaving tradition, the Mayan back-strap loom. And <i>this</i> is what we decided to focus on to build a Fair Trade business together given the many limitations in their lives.</p>
<p>Yabal currently supports around 60 indigenous women artisans through our fair trade ethical accessories line which we sell both retail and wholesale to stores in the US and Europe. These products allow our women weavers to earn a liveable income in order to support their families. </p>
<p>Despite the challenges they face, the women we partner with are an incredibly fun group of artists, business women, and mothers that have hope for a better future… and that is exactly what our name <i>Yabal</i> means, a k’iche’ word meaning “hope”. </p>
<p>All donations and all profits from the sale of Yabal products are used to fund social projects. We currently fund a scholarship program for children of the women weavers,  micro-credit loans to allow families to start businesses or rent farmland, maternity leave payments for pregnant weavers, and a women’s small business training program to teach women new skills in order to start their own businesses and earn extra income.</p>
<p>We’d like to invite YOU to be part of this incredible project!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to keep this important project going, we need YOUR help! We depend on your donations and product purchases to provide important jobs and social programs for these women.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A little can go a long way. We are a small organization and we use all resources and donations in the most efficient way possible. Our dream is to eventually be able to create more jobs for the women in these communities and be able to fund all of our social programs through sales alone. However, in order to reach that goal, we need your help along the way!</p>
<p>As an ethical Fair Trade business, we pay fair wages and invest in long term relationships with our artisans. In the current fashion world, this can be seen as a liability, as we are not able to cut costs through wages in order to make our business profitable quicker... </p>

<p>But we believe that business should be different. Fair trade is about bottom-up businesses and using our current economic trade system to actually, for once, help the producers first. This deeper commitment to uplifting producers makes this work doubly hard. When our artisans make a mistake or when clients would like products that are cheaper or faster to make, we won’t just jump ship and find a new artisan group to work with. We have a long-term commitment with our artisan groups to advance hand-in-hand together. Fair Trade is about People and Profit and about consumers choosing to support instead of exploit workers around the world. Thank you for giving us a chance and lending your support!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">""With so much violence, hatred and terror in the world around us there seems to be no space to speak and organize around issues that face transgender, queer and gender non-conforming people of color. That's why we've created the #BlackExcellenceTour, to fight back against the injustices we face everyday."" – CeCe McDonald</p>
<p>In 2016 Joshua Allen and CeCe McDonald started the #BlackExcellenceTour as a social justice project that combats violence against trans, gender non-conforming and queer people of color. We use art, activism, and storytelling to bring attention to issues affecting our communities and to begin having discussions about justice, freedom and equality that includes those living at the intersection of marginal identities.</p>
<p>Doing this work has been extremely rewarding and challenging. Throughout this past year alone we've facilitated workshops, delivered keynotes, and led discussions around these issues in over 18 cities and reached thousands of people. Unfortunately there is a real lack of funding and support for our grassroots organizing work.</p>
<p>With rollbacks in basic human rights protections and rising trends in violence and incarceration that disproportionately impacts trans and gender non-conforming people of color it is more important now than ever that we fund resistance that is for and by the people most impacted!</p>
<p>The #BlackExcellenceTour is rooted in the tradition of civil rights and anti-apartheid activists, as we bring the perspectives and power of black, queer, trans/gender non-conforming and femme lives to our organizing, education, and advocacy.

That's why we've created the #BlackExcellenceTour, to fight back against the injustices we face everyday."" – CeCe McDonald
In 2016 Joshua Allen and CeCe McDonald started the #BlackExcellenceTour as a social justice project that combats violence against trans, gender non-conforming and queer people of color. We use art, activism, and storytelling to bring attention to issues affecting our communities and to begin having discussions about justice, freedom and equality that includes those living at the intersection of marginal identities.
Doing this work has been extremely rewarding and challenging. Throughout this past year alone we've facilitated workshops, delivered keynotes, and led discussions around these issues in over 18 cities and reached thousands of people. Unfortunately there is a real lack of funding and support for our grassroots organizing work.
With rollbacks in basic human rights protections and rising trends in violence and incarceration that disproportionately impacts trans and gender non-conforming people of color it is more important now than ever that we fund resistance that is for and by the people most impacted!
The #BlackExcellenceTour is rooted in the tradition of civil rights and anti-apartheid activists, as we bring the perspectives and power of black, queer, trans/gender non-conforming and femme lives to our organizing, education, and advocacy. We center those who have been most marginalized. We share knowledge and build power to dismantle the systemic and structural oppression we live within. We fight back against forces working to render us silent and reclaim our bodies, voices, and lives.
We need funding to build power and support community organizing efforts for the upcoming year.  We will present free public workshops and trainings, and organize direct actions to address policing, prison abolition, body autonomy, reproductive justice, trans resilience, and other areas of immediate concern and impact in this harrowing time.  We begin our work in our local communities, and build national and international connections and momentum. Together we organize and build power, voice, and visibility, to bring about truly transformational change.

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p><strong>LIVE A GREAT STORY is heading to Port-au-Prince, Haiti for a focused trip on <a href=""http://sakala-haiti.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sakala</a>, a children's community center in the heart of one of the world's most dangerous and underprivileged areas. </strong></p>
<p>Our mission has two focuses 1) take supplies to further the Sakala mission, contribute manpower, investigate future action, discuss overall assistance program for Haiti 2) capture footage about the Sakala story for a media campaign for continued efforts to support their cause.</p>
<p><strong>The really cool part is that each donation makes 3X the impact! </strong></p>
<p>So check it out : when you donate to this trip, your money impacts 3 areas. </p>
<p>1) It goes towards supplies going <i>into </i>Haiti. We're taking a bunch of things down there to use in sports, gardening and education</p>
<p>2) It goes towards supplies <i>coming back from </i>Haiti. ALL OF THE PERKS are made in Haiti, so each item directly contributes to the Haiti economy because they are produced by Haitians with a living wage. Haiti has terrible unemployment so each item gives jobs, support families and prevent one of the main problems in Haiti : orphans</p>
<p>3) A video that will capture the inspiration of Sakala and the amazing impact it's making on hundreds of children's lives despite being located in a major slum </p>

<h2><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Back Story</strong></h2>
<p>4 months ago my friend Kamil from Poland and I went to Haiti to volunteer after Hurricane Matthew caused massive destruction across the country. We planned to join a group, however the day before leaving that group ended up pulling out of the country due to safety concerns. <i>We went anyway.</i> No plan, only a few connections and low expectations but the trip ended up being an amazing experience. We were able to connect with dozens of amazing people who have committed to the development of Haiti, to experience a completely different world and to collect lifelong memorable experiences. </p>
<p>One of the people we connected with was Daniel Tillias. Through <a href=""http://www.outsidethelens.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Outside the Lens</a>, a San Diego non-profit, we were able to reach out to Daniel to arrange a meeting. We didn't really know much about what he was doing but we were hungry to meet as many people as possible, so we reached out to him about shooting a video on him and his organization. </p>
<p>The day he came to pick us up traffic was terrible. Though he was only about five miles away, it took him almost two hours to pick us up and another hour to drive to Sakala. To make the most of our time, I interviewed him in the drive over, swerving in and out of traffic. When we arrived I tried to capture as much footage as possible but it was already dusk and the sun quickly disappeared. </p>
<p>Though we weren't able to film a full video, Sakala had a major impact on both Kamil and I. This community center was located in the middle of devastation, violence and hopelessness yet it was a shinning light for possibility, for hope, for community. We arrived to see dozens of kids playing soccer on a paved field, almost all of them wearing tattered socks. We saw older kids leading younger kids. We got a tour of Jaden Tap Tap, the country's largest urban garden where kids were caring after their gardens. </p>
<p>When it came time to leave, neither of us wanted to leave. I truly mean that I was on the verge of tearing up when Daniel dropped us off. It was a deep down feeling of pure admiration and respect.</p>
<p><i>And with that feeling was a clear calling to return... so that's what we're doing</i></p>
<h2>Where Funds Will Go</h2>
<p>This trip is the second half-step towards a major humanitarian mission. My Polish friend is working with <a href=""http://www.pmm.org.pl/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Polish Medical Mission</a> for an extended goal of continued support. We plan on going back to keep helping so this is another step towards learning more about the direct needs on the ground. <i>It's very important that we do not act as a hand out</i> but work alongside Haitians to rebuild <i>their </i>country. We want to enable them to take control, to grow, to own their country. </p>

The orphanage is in Edwige Gabriel's home, which is located in Carrefour, near Port-au-Prince. Currently, Ms. Gabriel houses and takes care of 26 orphans, ranging in ages 3-15 years old.

It gives a voice to people and an ear for leaders.
The designer, Jon Foster-Smith will stand for Parliament in May, to carry digital democracy to Government. The video is our campaign.
We need 
 
We need to get it out there. We need to tell people about True Democracy and show them how to use it. We're looking for help from social media people and key influencers We need to make it better. Thousands of small tweaks have gone in already. Every single one makes a better platform. The funds we are looking for will pay the current developer to continue for another year. So far it has been funded personally
We need to go native! It's currently browser only. We need it on iOS and Android    The Impact Our political system is centuries old. New technology means we can now gather ideas and opinion from real people each every day, not just at a time of election. All sorts of unpopular decisions are being made which are not in the interest of the population, and this must stop. For example...  We go to war
We give money to the banks, putting the country in debt
Big companies get away without paying tax Our pubs, communities and high streets are closing down
A new railway, HS2 is being forced through countryside without thought
Politicians toe a party line - they don't represent their constituents and risk harming their career.Democratic decisions must be made in the interests of everyone, not those with influence or wealth.    Risks & Challenges There are none. This can only make our society better. Even if True Democracy is not the future, it will inspire another democracy platform.

Subsequently, Bloom started employing young single women who had moved on their own from the countryside to the cities in search of work. Diana learnt that these young women are often prey to pimps and end up in sex work. She wanted to provide these women a safe work option. </span></p>

The aim was three-fold: teach the women a skill; save the environment through making products with recycled materials (in a country where rubbish is typically burnt); and preserve artisan skills like sewing and weaving. </span></p>

Thus Bloom Cambodia currently exists as Bloom Bags and Bloom Garden Guesthouse, both of which require her full time attention. Bloom Bags had a fantastic Cambodian manager for six years, Kagna, who in a wonderful example of ""passing it on"", started her own project feeding poor families who take their children to the free Jayavarman VII Hospital (see <a href=""http://www.upworthy.com/when-she-found-out-a-poor-mom-sold-her-baby-she-decided-to-change-things-a-little-at-a-time"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Upworthy video on Bloom Cambodia</a> for her story). </span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Last year, Kagna left to be a full-time mother and Diana tried running both businesses herself but found out that she could not. As a result, the bags business has been put on hold pending a new manager. After a long search, Bloom has now found a new manager in Abang who previously led a successful women empowerment program in the rural villages of the Riau Islands, Indonesia.  Abang believes passionately in building sustainable communities through empowering women. As proof of this belief, he has taken a big pay cut and relocated from Singapore to Siem Reap, Cambodia, to join the Bloom team to expand our operations so as to allow more Cambodian women access to economic opportunities. </span><br/></p>

Bloom has partnered with a Siem Reap based NGO Grace House (<a href=""http://www.gracehousecambodia.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.gracehousecambodia.org</a>). We have donated three sewing machines to the NGO and Grace House has started training a few women on making Bloom Bags. In addition to Grace House, we would like to continue running the Bloom Bags workshop at the Bloom Garden Guesthouse premises, employing single mothers who will be paid a fair wage and who will be working in a great environment. Your contributions will also allow us to replicate the Bloom workshop to rural villages around Cambodia to provide work for the women who live there.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Minimum wage for workers in the Cambodian garment factory has been raised from US$128 TO US$140 in 2016. To ensure that the women are able to have stable and secure lives, we would like to pay them US$150 a month. We would also like to employ two child-minders for the single mothers so they will be able to have peace of mind while working, knowing that their children are well taken of. <br/></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We will also be working with the Cambodian Women's Resource Centre who will send facilitators to conduct basic life skills lessons such as proper hygiene practices, budgeting and the importance of education.  Your contribution will also allow us to extend our partnership base, starting with individual volunteers from all over the world who have written to us wanting to contribute their skills, ranging from design to marketing to training and education. They will work alongside the women for a month and Bloom will provide a small stipend of US$50 during this time, </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Finally, with your contribution, we will also be able to continue assisting Kagna in the project she started. We will cook food for <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">parents who take their children to the free children's hospital at a cost of US$1 per person (Please see budget below for a more detailed breakdown of costs).</span></p>

We are most proud of Kagna, who has, through Bloom, started her own project that has benefited many other Cambodians. As she says, ""You see everybody they think they same as me: too many NGOs in Cambodia, why still have the poor people?....Because that is the problem in Cambodia, why Cambodians cannot help ourselves?""</p>

Diana started Bloom Cambodia in 2006 after a holiday to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, when she encountered a single mother who sold her new born baby boy for US$100. Instead of donating money to an NGO or start a charity, Diana decided to found a social enterprise to provide fair paying jobs to single mothers so they can take care of their families and send their children to school. Subsequently, Bloom started employing young single women who had moved on their own from the countryside to the cities in search of work. Diana learnt that these young women are often prey to pimps and end up in sex work. She wanted to provide these women a safe work option. 
The idea for a social enterprise was so Bloom would be self-reliant and self sustaining. The aim was three-fold: teach the women a skill; save the environment through making products with recycled materials (in a country where rubbish is typically burnt); and preserve artisan skills like sewing and weaving. 
In the last nine years, we have had tremendous support from many caring individuals, human rights groups and corporations such as Amnesty International, the National Football League (NFL) of the USA, Microsoft, CARE International and Blackberry. This proved to Diana there were many people who shared her belief in sustainable development and gave her the motivation to continue with her work.

                      
       Picture: Diana was featured in Blackberry Bold 9700 Print Ad, 2010 as a ""bold""          individual trying to make a difference.
  
                  
    Picture: Bloom Cambodia's completed messenger bags for Microsoft Singapore.

Since its inception in 2006, Bloom has been completely funded by Diana. In 2010, Diana started a guesthouse in Siem Reap to provide jobs and also to help fund the bags business. Thus Bloom Cambodia currently exists as Bloom Bags and Bloom Garden Guesthouse, both of which require her full time attention. Bloom Bags had a fantastic Cambodian manager for six years, Kagna, who in a wonderful example of ""passing it on"", started her own project feeding poor families who take their children to the free Jayavarman VII Hospital (see Upworthy video on Bloom Cambodia for her story).

Last year, Kagna left to be a full-time mother and Diana tried running both businesses herself but found out that she could not. As a result, the bags business has been put on hold pending a new manager. After a long search, Bloom has now found a new manager in Abang who previously led a successful women empowerment program in the rural villages of the Riau Islands, Indonesia.  Abang believes passionately in building sustainable communities through empowering women. As proof of this belief, he has taken a big pay cut and relocated from Singapore to Siem Reap, Cambodia, to join the Bloom team to expand our operations so as to allow more Cambodian women access to economic opportunities. 

WHERE WE ARE AT
With your contributions, and with Abang on board, we will be able to restart Bloom. Bloom has partnered with a Siem Reap based NGO Grace House (www.gracehousecambodia.org). We have donated three sewing machines to the NGO and Grace House has started training a few women on making Bloom Bags. In addition to Grace House, we would like to continue running the Bloom Bags workshop at the Bloom Garden Guesthouse premises, employing single mothers who will be paid a fair wage and who will be working in a great environment. Your contributions will also allow us to replicate the Bloom workshop to rural villages around Cambodia to provide work for the women who live there.
Minimum wage for workers in the Cambodian garment factory has been raised from US$128 TO US$140 in 2016. To ensure that the women are able to have stable and secure lives, we would like to pay them US$150 a month. We would also like to employ two child-minders for the single mothers so they will be able to have peace of mind while working, knowing that their children are well taken of. 
We will also be working with the Cambodian Women's Resource Centre who will send facilitators to conduct basic life skills lessons such as proper hygiene practices, budgeting and the importance of education.  Your contribution will also allow us to extend our partnership base, starting with individual volunteers from all over the world who have written to us wanting to contribute their skills, ranging from design to marketing to training and education. They will work alongside the women for a month and Bloom will provide a small stipend of US$50 during this time, 
Finally, with your contribution, we will also be able to continue assisting Kagna in the project she started. We will cook food for parents who take their children to the free children's hospital at a cost of US$1 per person (Please see budget below for a more detailed breakdown of costs).


MEASURING IMPACT


Bloom Bags has been improving the lives of Cambodian women, one woman at a time. We are most proud of Kagna, who has, through Bloom, started her own project that has benefited many other Cambodians. As she says, ""You see everybody they think they same as me: too many NGOs in Cambodia, why still have the poor people?....Because that is the problem in Cambodia, why Cambodians cannot help ourselves?""



Since 2006, we have enabled the Bloom women to be financially independent and their children have been able to attend school. Some of the women even have small sewing business on the side, altering and making clothes for their neighbours. Below are some of their stories:

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p><strong>We are a group of young women -- Grace Wallack, Mary Ross, Victoria Hall-Palerm, Katrina Vizzini, Catherine Berchard, Jessica Stallone, Megan Turley, and Rebecca Hamburg, to be exact -- who care passionately about access to abortion. Some of us are law students, some work in advertising, some in STEM, and others are health care providers. </strong>We all came together on Mary Ross's Facebook page to reply to this one troll, but that eventually blossomed into a much larger idea: a bumper sticker -- generously designed by Miguel Farias -- to raise money for organizations we care about while putting a lil bit of sass back out there into the world. Help us out!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We trying to raise at least <strong>$5000</strong> for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planned Parenthood, and</li>
<li>National Network of Abortion Funds</li>
</ul>
<p>100% of the money you spend on our Cheeky Bitch merch (aside from fees and shipping cost) will be split evenly between these two amazing organizations that support the right to control one's own body and destiny. Plus, it'll show that troll that nothing brings cheeky bitches down.</p>
<p>We will start ordering and shipping your stickers once we reach our $5000 goal. After that, additional donations are welcome and merch will shipped out on a rolling basis!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here's the article that started it all: <a href=""https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a10033320/pro-life-abortion/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/...</a></p>
<p>It's hard to overstate the impact on a person's life of being denied safe reproductive care. And let's not kid ourselves -- the consequences of a world without <i>Roe v. Wade</i> will not be a world without abortions. It will be a world without<i> safe<i> </i></i>abortions.

We are a group of young women -- Grace Wallack, Mary Ross, Victoria Hall-Palerm, Katrina Vizzini, Catherine Berchard, Jessica Stallone, Megan Turley, and Rebecca Hamburg, to be exact -- who care passionately about access to abortion. Some of us are law students, some work in advertising, some in STEM, and others are health care providers. We all came together on Mary Ross's Facebook page to reply to this one troll, but that eventually blossomed into a much larger idea: a bumper sticker -- generously designed by Miguel Farias -- to raise money for organizations we care about while putting a lil bit of sass back out there into the world. Help us out!

What We Need & What You Get
We trying to raise at least $5000 for:

Planned Parenthood, and
National Network of Abortion Funds

100% of the money you spend on our Cheeky Bitch merch (aside from fees and shipping cost) will be split evenly between these two amazing organizations that support the right to control one's own body and destiny. Plus, it'll show that troll that nothing brings cheeky bitches down.
We will start ordering and shipping your stickers once we reach our $5000 goal. After that, additional donations are welcome and merch will shipped out on a rolling basis!

The Impact
Here's the article that started it all: https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/...
It's hard to overstate the impact on a person's life of being denied safe reproductive care. And let's not kid ourselves -- the consequences of a world without Roe v. Wade will not be a world without abortions. It will be a world without safe abortions. These policies will mean the difference between life and death for those without privilege and access. 
It's a scary time. In just the past two days, the swing Justice on the Supreme Court stepped down and the Court delivered a 5-4 decision that outlawed giving accurate information to women about their own medical procedures.  Organizations out there fighting for women need all the help they can get, and we all need to be reminded not to stay quiet.  
Your contributions will go a long way to making this world a little less scary for women and uterus-havers trying to exert autonomy over their own bodies. The money will help the abortion providers and the legal teams out there fighting for us, and the sass will help remind every woman (and ally!) that we're down, but not out. 

Risks & Challenges
Risks of wearing our lit stickers include inciting the trolls and perhaps not getting a job in the Trump Administration. I think we can handle it.

Other Ways You Can Help
There are lots of ways to support reproductive rights if you cannot donate to our campaign at this time. 

Call your senator or representative.
Volunteer to walk women to clinics.
Fight the Alans in your life, if you've got the time to spare for emotional labor.
Share this link on FB, Twitter, or Instagram -- wherever kids these days spread the word!
And seriously, get out there and VOTE in November!

<h3><strong>Why we must act NOW to support families in Bangladesh</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>Early this year, COVID-19 swept across the globe, creating tremendous challenges for families around the world.  In Bangladesh, where malnutrition is already rampant, <a href=""https://sightandlife.org/blog/covid19-climate-change-malnutrition/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>the pandemic has made it even harder for families to afford and find quality, nutritious foods</i></a>. Many people have lost their jobs, and the spread of the virus in the community and prevalence of multi-family and multi-generational homes means that you put your entire extended family at risk every time you leave the house, even to work or get food.</p>
<p>With this situation at hand, it's nearly impossible for many families to meet their nutritional needs, especially the young children, who need the nutrition the most for proper growth and development.</p>
<p><a href=""https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/105/4/944/4633971"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The first 1000 days of a child's life is very crucial to the trajectory of her life</a> - with the right nutrition, she will be well-equipped with a healthy body to deal with life's challenges.  Without proper nutrition, the body and immune system are at greater risk for contracting the virus and will be less capable at fighting it. For children particularly, poor nutrition has <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3607807/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i><strong>permanent negative consequences for cognitive development</strong></i></a>, affecting them for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>Not only that, pregnant also women require tremendous amounts of nutrients to properly nurture their babies before they are born, and poor nutrition among mothers both before and after pregnancy has a significant impact on health outcomes for children.</p>

The first 1000 days of a child's life is very crucial to the trajectory of her life - with the right nutrition, she will be well-equipped with a healthy body to deal with life's challenges.  Without proper nutrition, the body and immune system are at greater risk for contracting the virus and will be less capable at fighting it. For children particularly, poor nutrition has permanent negative consequences for cognitive development, affecting them for the rest of their lives.
Not only that, pregnant also women require tremendous amounts of nutrients to properly nurture their babies before they are born, and poor nutrition among mothers both before and after pregnancy has a significant impact on health outcomes for children.

<b>WHY</b>?<br/><p>   Our charity fund ""Peace. Prosperity. Development"" was established by a 
group of volunteers with important goal - to give as much help 
as possible to the victims of conflict in East Ukraine in 
2014-15. <br/></p>
<p>It's impossible to stay indifferent to the events of recent months in Eastern Ukraine - people die, families lose breadwinners, thousands of homes are destroyed, many families are forced to leave their homes and seek refuge in other peaceful regions<br/>of Ukraine. Already more than a million of refugees are in need of new housing and support NOW.</p>

<h3>I am doing this fundraiser in desperate hope to help save my granddaughter's life. Back in September 2020, she was helping her mom at home and, she fell and hurt her ankle, my son took her to the hospital, the doctors recommended her to rest and give it some time to heal, however, she spent 2 months in excruciating pain, after several months of suffering without any answers a biopsy revealed the heartbreaking news that Natalia who is only 10 years old was diagnosed with aggressive Osteosarcoma on her right foot. Her doctors are recommending bringing her to the USA for treatment as conditions in her country of origin are extremely difficult right now and there are not many options available for her over there. She is almost done with chemotherapy and the next step is surgery on her foot. She is approved to travel to the USA with a humanitarian visa for medical treatment, the only thing we need is the funds for treatment. We only have 2 weeks left before they do the surgery where the only option they have for Natalia is to amputate. Please help us, please help our sweet Natalia beat this cancer beast! We only have 2 weeks to have the funds deposited to Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida and the Hospital will then release the treatment payment confirmation to the US embassy. Please donate if you can and if you can't please share. HELP US FIND a SPONSOR. We are desperate and any help will mean the world to us.

Our solution is to teach young girls self-defence moves that can help them get out of dangerous situations.<br/>But this is not enough! It is essential that these girls become aware of themselves and their abilities, boosting their own confidence. We propose to do this by talking about rights and opportunities, because the knowledge of oneself and of their capabilities abolishes the differences.<br/>We want to guarantee girls the right integration in community and in schoold, as well as the chance for them to feel safe, wherever they are. </p><p>Girls have the right to live their womanhood.</p><p>The problem of violence against women in India is ancient, just think that in 2014 only in Delhi there were 1700 rapes.</p><p>With your help we can guarantee girls integration and safety.</p><p>We will provide children a self-defence course with a certified trainer. <br/>We will also give girls whistles and pepper spray.</p><p> </p><p>WHO WE ARE</p><p> </p><p>We are HEEALS (Health, Education, Environment and Livelihood Society), a vibrant Indian non-profit aiming at building a self-sustained society in India, by empowering local communities with education, awareness and basic skills.</p><p>We are registered under Section 21 of 1860 Society Act with the Government of India, and most of our work is based on volunteering.                 </p><p>We particularly focus on children and we work a lot with schools in local villages and rural areas.

Our solution is to teach young girls self-defence moves that can help them get out of dangerous situations.But this is not enough! It is essential that these girls become aware of themselves and their abilities, boosting their own confidence. We propose to do this by talking about rights and opportunities, because the knowledge of oneself and of their capabilities abolishes the differences.We want to guarantee girls the right integration in community and in schoold, as well as the chance for them to feel safe, wherever they are. Girls have the right to live their womanhood.The problem of violence against women in India is ancient, just think that in 2014 only in Delhi there were 1700 rapes.With your help we can guarantee girls integration and safety.We will provide children a self-defence course with a certified trainer. We will also give girls whistles and pepper spray. WHO WE ARE We are HEEALS (Health, Education, Environment and Livelihood Society), a vibrant Indian non-profit aiming at building a self-sustained society in India, by empowering local communities with education, awareness and basic skills.We are registered under Section 21 of 1860 Society Act with the Government of India, and most of our work is based on volunteering.                 We particularly focus on children and we work a lot with schools in local villages and rural areas.

It prevents and eliminates their suffering through early identification, correct assessment and treatment of pain and other physical, psycho-social and spiritual issues. The goal of palliative care is to ensure the quality of life for the patients and their families. It helps both the patient to live as close to normal as possible, and the family to cope with the patient's illness and following bereavement.",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

It is essential that these girls become aware of themselves and their abilities, boosting their own confidence.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>The purpose of this campaign is: </strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Virginia, I am a student of social work and pastoral care in college. Also I am a volunteer at Day Care Center in Kaunas (Lithuania) for homeless people.</p>
<p>When people see the homeless, they don't tend to see the humanity in them. They see them as problems, as being dirty or less than themselves. But I believe that everyone is part of the same human family and that we all deserve to be treated as such. There are lots of ways to help homeless people. I am donating my time for him. And I would like to create some more changes for homeless people. I‘m not alone in this project: there are also two social workers in the Day care center: Vitalija and Raimonda. We have decided to do something about it.</p>
<p>We believe that to help someone overcome their challenges and no longer be homeless they need 3 things:</p>
<p>1. Health</p>
<p>2. Shelter/security</p>
<p>3. Purpose</p>
<p>Most of organizations in Lithuania are only focusing on number 2, getting them into homeless shelters or affordable housing. However 80% of the homeless that stay in the shelters end up back on the street within a year. It is not a permanent solution.</p>
<p>The Day Care center is trying to address all three, as a more holistic approach, but especially to the first. Homeless people are at relatively high risk for a broad range of acute and chronic illnesses. Precise data on the prevalence of specific illnesses among homeless people compared with those among nonhomeless people are difficult to obtain, but there is a body of information indicating that homelessness is associated with a number of physical and mental problems.</p>
<h2><strong>What we need</strong></h2>
<p><strong>We need cash donations to be able to buy the items that we have not been able to get donated. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Things that they are in immediate need of, such as: clean underwear, hygiene items, feminine supplies, many medicines, treatment costs and other things.</strong></p>
<p>What if we all built a resource that would help change that? </p>

<p>We believe that as we see them as valuable parts of society, as we listen to them, and encourage them to do better, that they will then be empowered to rise to the level that we see them at. If all we ever expect from and see, is a drug addict, then that’s all they ever will be. But if you see them as a brother, a friend, a hard worker, then it allows them to improve.</p>
<p>We believe that everyone should be treated fairly and as a human being.  I like to think of everyone as one big family.</p>
<p>This campaign will need your support and every cent makes a difference in a poor elderly's life. Your contribution will make a big difference!</p>

<p>If you see a homeless person, please, try talking to them. See what their story is before being so quick to judge them. They may just teach you something. We have come to realize that there is a “pearl” inside of everyone including the homeless, and the longer you talk with someone and invest in your relationship, the more good that you are able to see in them.

To me he was a mentor, a friend, a confidant, and a brother. He was a selfless person always giving and helping others. With all of this we are asking for help to give Dan a proper send off, give everyone a chance to say their goodbyes and celebrate his life with the people he loved so much. He will truly be missed.

</div><p><b>THE HUMANITARIAN
PROBLEM</b></p>
<p>Over the last days, thousands of Syrian refugees are
entering Serbia and the Balkans in search of safety. We want to help these
people — and especially mothers — who are carrying children to safety in their
own arms. Babies may be small, but their extra weight adds up quickly without
proper support. They're also carrying their supplies, including food and water,
as they move. Imagine how much you'd appreciate an extra hand!</p>
<p>Once they leave Serbia, mothers have to
walk hundreds of kilometers with babies and toddlers in their arms; a task
that is physically strenuous to say the least! Serbia is only the
beginning of a long and ardous trip for Syrian refugees, so we want to make
sure their lives are a bit easier with baby carriers that will lessen the weight
and free their arms! Baby carriers will not only keep children safely
tucked against their parent's torso or back, but will also make an
immediate and meaningful impact in the lives of these mothers and fathers
who are in need.</p>
<p>This campaign is set up to collect funds so we
can purchase 100 baby and toddler sized baby carriers at
wholesale price and personally deliver them to Serbia. All
proceeds will be spent directly in the purchase and delivery of the baby
carriers. We will deliver baby carriers to refugees throughout Serbia in
collaboration with our partners.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443772658/d80vjnv5or1t9onlittq.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 253.705px; height: 169px;""/></p>

<p></p></div>","THE HUMANITARIAN
PROBLEM
Over the last days, thousands of Syrian refugees are
entering Serbia and the Balkans in search of safety. We want to help these
people — and especially mothers — who are carrying children to safety in their
own arms. Babies may be small, but their extra weight adds up quickly without
proper support. They're also carrying their supplies, including food and water,
as they move. Imagine how much you'd appreciate an extra hand!
Once they leave Serbia, mothers have to
walk hundreds of kilometers with babies and toddlers in their arms; a task
that is physically strenuous to say the least! Serbia is only the
beginning of a long and ardous trip for Syrian refugees, so we want to make
sure their lives are a bit easier with baby carriers that will lessen the weight
and free their arms! Baby carriers will not only keep children safely
tucked against their parent's torso or back, but will also make an
immediate and meaningful impact in the lives of these mothers and fathers
who are in need.
This campaign is set up to collect funds so we
can purchase 100 baby and toddler sized baby carriers at
wholesale price and personally deliver them to Serbia. All
proceeds will be spent directly in the purchase and delivery of the baby
carriers. We will deliver baby carriers to refugees throughout Serbia in
collaboration with our partners.
WHAT WE NEED
1 Baby carrier cost: 26 $We are friends (from Serbia and Croatia) who are traveling to Presevo (Serbian-Macedonian border) from Belgrade on 24th of October.
WAYS YOU CAN HELP

MAKE A MONETARY CONTRIBUTION TO OUR INDIEGOGO
CAMPAIGN:
A $26 donation will cover the full cost of a brand new
baby or toddler carrier and the cost to get it there! Every dollar helps!
SHARE THIS CAMPAIGN ON FACEBOOK:
Please share so we can get ourselves known!!!
RISKS
There is literally no risk. We are going to turn your
money into supplies. Excess Money will be donated!
We are going to cover percentage IndieGoGo takes, that
way, 100% of your money goes to the refugees. We will also try to contact other
organisations, to cooperate with.

<h2>The Discrimination Against Women: Epic Fail</h2>
<p><br/>My name is Shane Willow Mittman and I'm the founder of Women Endorsed. Like so many of you, I'm a woman who's tired of the ongoing fight for women's equality. Enough, already! The discrimination against women in our society and around the world is an epic failure and we’re the ones who are going to have to turn it around by any and all means we have. With your contribution, Women Endorsed directs our spending superpower <i>for our benefit</i> and tips the scale into balance once and for all!</p>
<p><strong><i>Women Endorsed is a movement to harness women’s purchasing power by certifying women-positive companies. It's a certification process that’s just like the ‘Fair Trade’ movement. What this means is Women Endorsed will only qualify, verify and certify businesses that actually support women’s equality with their policies, practices and culture. This certification process empowers women to know where to spend our money!</i></strong></p>
<p>One of the most exciting things for me about Women Endorsed is that we don’t need anyone but ourselves to make it happen! We don’t need to convince anyone of anything. We don’t need to change laws or wait for elections to come around. Women Endorsed uses what we already have and directs it for our benefit right now!</p>
<ul>
<li><p><i>How’s it going to feel to never spend another penny with companies that are not good to women?</i></p></li>
<li><p><i>How’s it going to feel to put your dollars into companies that treat their employees and customers right?</i></p></li>
<li><p><i>How will it feel to tip that scale into balance once and for all by doing something you already do?</i><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493100691/z6mgwvmgulwwwcte4itr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></li>

<h2>Our launch funding campaign will support three important initiatives:</h2>
<ul>
<li>First, WE will <strong>create WE's international business structure and a business development/investor development strategy</strong> to ensure WE's sustainability post-launch. <br/> </li>
<li>Second, WE will <strong>consult and convene experts to help guide our selection of criteria and standards, and develop the process WE will use to certify companies.</strong> Our certification criteria and process are crucial to the success of WE. WE need to maintain a high standard for what we expect from companies to achieve the tangible, measurable social change that women require and expect. We also need to understand how companies record the data that WE will use to verify their practices and to provide secure ways for them to share that sensitive information safely and economically with WE.<br/> </li>
<li>Third, WE will <strong>develop our interactive website</strong> that supports our outward-facing engagement with women around the world and the businesses that WE certifies and supports. Our website will be a hub of information gathering and sharing. Women will need access to lists of WE-certified companies in varied industries to know where to spend our money. The site will be our community link to engage with to stay informed. Qualified, certified WE companies will expect to be celebrated and promoted to our WE community via our website as well as through the press and social media. Companies interested in becoming certified will need a welcoming, interactive, easy-to-use application process with secure, safe transmission of the private and highly sensitive documentation of their practices for verification. </li>
</ul>
<p>Included in our outward facing presence is our launch-stage <strong>marketing and branding</strong>. This includes logo refinement, press releases and media relations, marketing and social media activity.</p>
<p>The support of women (and men) for Women Endorsed is crucial. Becoming members of our private Facebook group (women-only for now), subscribing to WE’s updates at womenendorsed.com and donating to this launch campaign claims the power that belongs to us and engages our personal and collective intent to use it! <br/><br/><strong>Our cumulative, collective spending IS our superpower</strong>. It is OUR collective endorsement of businesses (and rejecting of others that are not nice to women) that IS our voice. It's critical for women to engage their support of WE to fully fund this initial launch campaign. Women Endorsed will only harness this potential as planned if WE raise the target sum required for launch. If we do not reach the target, any and all funds donated will be returned to each donor. </p>

<h2>WE: Gaining Momentum!</h2>
<ul>
<li>WE is being recognized by women around the world. <strong>Five days after our private FB group was started, 2,000 women had already joined! Now we have over 3,500</strong> from more than 12 countries including Brazil, Croatia, Mexico, Canada, France, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Belgium, United Kingdom and Quatar! </li>
<li>WE has built relationships with women’s advocates who support our mission and <strong>clearly see WE’s potential to effect significant social change. </strong>
</li>
<li>WE attracted a lot of attention and support at the San Francisco Women’s March.  <br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>WE faces <strong>three important challenges</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, WE's power base comes from the number of women who join the movement. <strong>Building our power base is critical to the success of WE. </strong><br/> </li>
<li>Second, and linked to the size of WE's membership, <strong>WE must create value for businesses that qualify to be Women Endorsed.</strong> The bigger WE’s membership and reach is, the more we add to the bottom line and brand value of businesses we support. Conversely, businesses that don’t support women will experience loss of loyalty, revenue and brand support from women who will not abide by the status quo in the market and workplace. <br/> </li>
<li>Third, our <strong>criteria need to be strong</strong> enough recognize companies that truly support women and not so lax that we sell ourselves short.  Cumulatively, WE certification will create the significant social change women demand. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WE will meet these challenges.</strong> WE will use your funding dollars to engage and convene high level consultants to select appropriate criteria to support our goals for the long term. WE has created an Ambassador program to grow our member power base and engage women who want to take action and be involved. WE will work with small and large women's groups, businesses and organizations to spread the Women Endorsed word, far and wide. WE will use social media, the press and speaking engagements with women-positive events to grow our base. WE will create critical mass to make this movement useful and strategic for women and critical mass to render it vital to Women Endorsed certified businesses. WE will begin by recognizing and certifying women-positive companies that already support women's equality by their policies, practices and cultures. There are many out there.<br/> </p>

What happens in such systems is that a risk score is computed for each defendant so that it reflected the likelihood of them reoffending and then recommends a sentence according to that score. Although many profound questions and controversies linger around the concept as it is currently being used, the “big-data toolset” it makes use of could very well be used to the benefit of racial justice.

</h2></div>","Two Questions for You:Do you see a need to remedy racial bias in sentencing?Do you see legislation to that effect happening anytime soon? For all the improvements in recent years, racial bias continues to plague sentencing. With the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act dying in Congress last year, died, too, our best shot at a comprehensive reform anytime soon.  The Plan: Turning Racial Bias Inside OutThe core idea is to regard racial bias as a flaw in judicial self-consistency.What follows is that minimizing self-inconsistency also minimizes racial bias. Solving a more general problem is akin to the surgical incision of racial bias out of a system with tissue of inconsistency surrounding it.“A self-consistent judge is an unbiased judge”The ultimate goal of the project is to set up a public monitoring website where judges would be evaluated continuously and automatically based on their self-consistency. Merits / OpportunitiesDemanding judges to be self-consistent doesn’t affect their freedoms to cultivate their own patterns of sentencing. Case in point, a judge could be a lot more punitive than others and still rank better on self-consistency (and thus on racial fairness).A neutral and non-emotional framing like this one has the capacity of winning the support of judges rather than antagonizing them.Judges are the ultimate decision-makers in sentencing on a criminal case no matter how complex the system that comes before them. Because of that, any solution that revolves around a judge is future-proof in the sense that, regardless of how the criminal justice system evolves in the future, it will be able to compensate for the plethora of biases that the criminal justice system as a whole suffers from.An exciting new direction is using FairDiscretion along with criminal justice’s emerging star, Risk-based sentencing (aka. Evidence-based sentencing). What happens in such systems is that a risk score is computed for each defendant so that it reflected the likelihood of them reoffending and then recommends a sentence according to that score. Although many profound questions and controversies linger around the concept as it is currently being used, the “big-data toolset” it makes use of could very well be used to the benefit of racial justice. In the future, through means of machine-learning, FairDiscretion could even help tailor the parameters of risk-assessment systems so that they arrive at sentences that are fair and racially unbiased. ChallengesBecause judges get their inputs from a system that already suffers from bias at every one of its stages (e.g. law enforcement and prosecution), some of them receive more disparate inputs than do others. We ought to account for other sources of bias to make sure that every judge is on an equal footing.Only around 5% to 10% of cases are resolved through trials, the rest is plea bargained. Thus it is imperative that, at some point, we go beyond the judiciary and include other actors (certainly prosecutors) who have the power to exercise discretion in the process.A careless implementation could make it possible for a judge to maintain a good overall score of self-consistency wherein a poor performance in racial fairness is being offset by good performances in all the other components of self-consistency. We need to pay extra care when implementing the system so that pockets of bias cannot linger. A solution to this could involve considering the department with the poorest performance. Ways You Can HelpContribute to the CampaignYour support will enable us to flesh out the concept and work out the nuts-and-bolts of the system.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Let's not beat around the bush, we all know that the recent developments in the political sphere are very concerning for the future of our planet. </p>
<ul>
<li>The United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union after being misled by a campaign of lies, which was followed up by a horrendous hike in hate crimes.</li>
<li>The USA has just voted for a President who during his campaign openly discriminated against women and many, many minorities. His rhetoric was quite frankly scary.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two major changes indicate that many people have given into a rhetoric of fear that lacks little (if any) factual backing. Furthermore, the two campaigns went against experts' advice, and both demonised immigrants, who are often among the biggest contributors to a flourishing society.</p>
<p>Therefore, we propose to unite people who wish to stand up against the hateful rhetoric we are seeing with far too much regularity. </p>
<p>Together, with your help, we would like to buy a private island and develop it in an environmentally friendly way. This would lead to us being able to establish a society that believes in social harmony and condemns hate. While very few people have the resources to do this alone, together, as a group, we could contribute to one of the most exciting projects in world history. A project that indicates how we want the future of humanity to look. </p>

<li>We <strong>cannot</strong> stand by and watch sections of our communities get told that they are inferior to anyone else because of their skin colour, sexuality, gender or religion.</li>
<li>We <strong>cannot</strong> stand by and watch our planet destroyed by the reckless combustion of fossil fuels without sustainable plans to move to cleaner energy.</li>
<li>We <strong>cannot</strong> stand by and watch other animals suffer changes in their habitat because of our laziness and unwillingness to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through establishing a community on an <u>uninhabited</u> island that believes in equality and wants to work together, we can show the world just what humans of all backgrounds can do when we work together.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This bit is not going to be easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>With just over $25,000,000US we can buy a large enough private island whose equivalent area in London is home to over 100,000 people. Therefore with that amount of money we could buy an island big enough to support a relatively decent sized community.</li>
<li>After buying the island, any amount we receive would be used to survey the land, its biodiversity and plan to build on it in an environmentally friendly way. This would lead to establishing a currently unknown number of residencies and business premises so that the island becomes self-sufficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>What will be interesting is, if this project takes off, it is very possible that other businesses may decide that they want to help and as a consequence the project will take off even more.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>At first this project seems farfetched but the more you read about it, the more you'll probably want it to come true. Here are some of the impacts we would expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sustainable development of an island.</li>
<li>The advancement of environmentally friendly practises.</li>
<li>Send a message to divisive politicians that so many of us believe in a better society.</li>
<li>If we manage to get this project off the ground, it will show that so many of us desire a society that does not discriminate against people for their race, sexuality or gender.</li>
<li>A new way of life for many people.</li>

<p><strong>What is our story?</strong></p>
<p>We founded Art For Education to bring art and learning together to help improve education in small communities around the world.</p>
<p>We are a group of artists who work hand in hand with small schools and NGOs to help them build and create stronger schools by selling fine art prints.</p>
<p> Each year we are holding a worldwide campaign where we create one of a kind pieces of art for our project, themed around the country and community we are working with.</p>
<p>We are working with different organizations and NGOs around the world to help raise money for their schools and community educational projects.</p>
<p>Our amazing artists this year: </p>

<p><strong>Why education and our goal</strong></p>
<p>Every time education is improved somewhere in the world, more opportunities are created and seeds are planted for a bright and thriving future. </p>
<p>This year we are working with three NGOs:</p>
<p>Moyo Wa Huduma - Kenya </p>

</div></div>","What is our story?
We founded Art For Education to bring art and learning together to help improve education in small communities around the world.
We are a group of artists who work hand in hand with small schools and NGOs to help them build and create stronger schools by selling fine art prints.
 Each year we are holding a worldwide campaign where we create one of a kind pieces of art for our project, themed around the country and community we are working with.
We are working with different organizations and NGOs around the world to help raise money for their schools and community educational projects.
Our amazing artists this year: 
John HorneAmelina JonesAnoukATJCarol GoodchildAkrisAna Mitrovic 
Why education and our goal
Every time education is improved somewhere in the world, more opportunities are created and seeds are planted for a bright and thriving future. 
This year we are working with three NGOs:
Moyo Wa Huduma - Kenya 
The Chosen Vessels  - Kenya 
Caring For Children In Uganda - Uganda 
We are hoping to raise 500 euros for each school, we will be sharing all the funds we raise evenly between these three NGOs, each one of them works tirelessly to protect, care and provide education to the children in their communities.

<h3>THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT - destroyed this business</h3>
<p>For over a year beginning in early 2016 the TRENTON POLICE DEPARTMENT harassed this business and the owners because they wouldn't close at 11pm. FACTUALLY: The law did allowed them to stay open until 2am, but the police could not read or comprehend zoning and tax zones and illegal forced closures. When Edward filed a federal lawsuit March 2016, the police retaliated by filing a series of false bogus charges against him and unjustly jailed him from 3/17/17 -5/24/18 (447 days) </p>
<p>THE POLICE ISSUED DOZENS OF TICKETS and harassed patrons....Later (2/6/2018) Judge rules THE POLICE were wrong.

<p>A jury found Ed ""NJ Weedman"" Forchion not guilty of witness tampering Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>The marijuana activist raised his arms in victory after the jury read the verdict in Mercer County Superior Court in Trenton.</p>
<p>His supporters cheered, and with a smile on his face, he invited the prosecutor, John Boyle, to his victory party.</p>
<p>Before that, he asked the judge about the 400-plus days he's spent in jail awaiting, and during his two trials. The Weedman, though, had to go back to the Mercer County jail to be officially released.</p>
<p>""I guess it goes to show that you can be provocative or rub people the wrong way, but that's not a crime,"" his standby public defender Chris Campbell said after the verdict.</p>
<p>At his first trial in November, a jury acquitted him of one count of witness tampering, and was hung on a second, forcing this trial. He acted as his own attorney both times.</p>
<p>He said then, and repeated it at this trial, that he was just exercising his First Amendment rights when he sent packages containing letters and photos to the family of a confidential informant in the marijuana dealing case against him.</p>
<p>'Weedman' takes a knee in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick at start of trial</p>
<p>Ed Forchion kicked off his latest trial kneeling, an ode to ex-NFL quarterback and national anthem kneeler Colin Kaepernick</p>
<p>During his hour-long closing statements Tuesday, Forchion repeated to jurors sentiments of his opening statements. He claimed he always wanted the confidential informant to testify in his drug trial and that he didn't go against a protective order concealing the identity of the informant.</p>
<p>""At no time did I deliberately break this order, because there was no order,"" Forchion said.</p>
<p>He also said everything he posted on social media and mailed to the family of the informant was him ""just exercising his right to free speech.""</p>
<p>Forchion also asked the jury in closing statements that no matter what they decide, ""please make it unanimous, so I'm not stuck in this place anymore.""</p>
<p>Boyle, an assistant Mercer County prosecutor, told the jury in his closing statements that sending multiple packages to the family members of a confidential informant couldn't be construed as anything other than threatening. </p>
<p>The first package, addressed to the father of the confidential informant, contained a letter stating ""You've been served,"" and, ""Give him s---, then give him this [package].""</p>
<p>Other packages were sent to members of the confidential informant's family, stating Forchion knew what kind of car they drove, where children in the family lived and multiple handwritten notes calling the confidential informant a ""rat-fink b---h.""</p>
<p>""In its totality, mailing after mailing, after mailing,"" Boyle said to the jury, ""After reaching out to his mother, father, his wife, his neighbors, his sister. Who would ever come in (to testify) after this?""</p>
<p>Forchion still awaits trial on marijuana dealing charges, the case from which the witness tampering accusations stemmed.</p>
<p>In that case, Mercer County authorities raided his restaurant in Trenton in the summer of 2016 and arrested him and others on accusations he was dealing marijuana from the business - NJ Weedman's Joint, and an adjacent cannabis church, both on East State Street across from Trenton City Hall.</p>
<p>He had posted bail on that case when he was arrested and jailed in this, tampering case.</p>

<p>The Mercer County Prosecutor's Office announced Wednesday it will be dropping most of the remaining drug and related charges against Edward ""NJ Weedman"" stemming from a 2016 raid on his Trenton restaurant.</p>
<p>What is not dismissed will be downgraded to municipal court, where jail time is unlikely.</p>
<p>But Forchion's not seeing this as all good news. </p>
<p>Late last month, Forchion was found not guilty by a jury on third-degree witness tampering charges - a case that also grew from the drug raid.</p>
<p>The marijuana activist spent about 15 months detained in the Mercer County jail during two trials, and was set free hours after he was acquitted.</p>
<p>The prosecutor's office said the decision to not move forward in prosecuting Forchion came after considering the shift in climate of marijuana legislation in New Jersey.</p>
<p>""They're about 10 years too late,"" Forchion said of a change in public opinion of marijuana. </p>
<p>The office also considered the changes in law regarding the state's bail reform - an issue Forchion railed against during his time in jail.</p>
<p>""I'm half-way happy and half-way mad,"" he said Wednesday night. ""Now the state just drops the charges, and I've already spent 16 months in jail. I had 42 charges against me total. It was a campaign of terror by the police department.""</p>
<p>NJ Weedman spent 400-plus days in jail. Turns out he was not guilty</p>
<p>Can he get anything for all the time he spent locked up?</p>
<p>""These factors call for an adjustment in the way the office most appropriately uses its resources and assistance from other law enforcement agencies in order to prioritize detention cases such as murders, attempted murders and violent crime,"" the prosecutor's statement said.</p>
<p>""The fact that the defendant has served more than a year in prison while these cases were pending was also taken into consideration,"" it continued.</p>
<p>In all, Forchion had been indicted in 2016 and 2017 and was facing 11 charges related to narcotics dealings and cyber harassment. The prosecutor's office has dismissed most of the charges, and downgraded five to ""disorderly persons offenses,"" all of which will be tried in Trenton Municipal Court. </p>
<p>The state is currently wrestling with ideas of how to deal with the hundreds of thousands of people who have been charged with marijuana crimes. Some legislators are considering expunging low-level convictions, but aren't yet sure of the logistics. </p>
<p>""After a review of the defendant's pending cases,"" the prosecutor's office said in its statement, ""We feel the downgrade and dismissal of the charges is an appropriate resolution.""</p>

For over a year beginning in early 2016 the TRENTON POLICE DEPARTMENT harassed this business and the owners because they wouldn't close at 11pm. FACTUALLY: The law did allowed them to stay open until 2am, but the police could not read or comprehend zoning and tax zones and illegal forced closures. When Edward filed a federal lawsuit March 2016, the police retaliated by filing a series of false bogus charges against him and unjustly jailed him from 3/17/17 -5/24/18 (447 days) 
THE POLICE ISSUED DOZENS OF TICKETS and harassed patrons....Later (2/6/2018) Judge rules THE POLICE were wrong. (DISMISSES TICKETS).
After being found ""NOT GUILTY"" on fake charges the Prosecutors office then dismissed the remaining fake charges. - ( PROSECUTORS DISMISS CHARGES)

NJWEEDMAN FOUND NOT GUILTY

NJ Weedman acquitted of witness tampering at 2nd trial
May 24th 2018

A jury found Ed ""NJ Weedman"" Forchion not guilty of witness tampering Thursday afternoon.
The marijuana activist raised his arms in victory after the jury read the verdict in Mercer County Superior Court in Trenton.

""I guess it goes to show that you can be provocative or rub people the wrong way, but that's not a crime,"" his standby public defender Chris Campbell said after the verdict.
At his first trial in November, a jury acquitted him of one count of witness tampering, and was hung on a second, forcing this trial. He acted as his own attorney both times.
He said then, and repeated it at this trial, that he was just exercising his First Amendment rights when he sent packages containing letters and photos to the family of a confidential informant in the marijuana dealing case against him.

During his hour-long closing statements Tuesday, Forchion repeated to jurors sentiments of his opening statements. He claimed he always wanted the confidential informant to testify in his drug trial and that he didn't go against a protective order concealing the identity of the informant.
""At no time did I deliberately break this order, because there was no order,"" Forchion said.
He also said everything he posted on social media and mailed to the family of the informant was him ""just exercising his right to free speech.""
Forchion also asked the jury in closing statements that no matter what they decide, ""please make it unanimous, so I'm not stuck in this place anymore.""
Boyle, an assistant Mercer County prosecutor, told the jury in his closing statements that sending multiple packages to the family members of a confidential informant couldn't be construed as anything other than threatening. 
The first package, addressed to the father of the confidential informant, contained a letter stating ""You've been served,"" and, ""Give him s---, then give him this [package].""
Other packages were sent to members of the confidential informant's family, stating Forchion knew what kind of car they drove, where children in the family lived and multiple handwritten notes calling the confidential informant a ""rat-fink b---h.""
""In its totality, mailing after mailing, after mailing,"" Boyle said to the jury, ""After reaching out to his mother, father, his wife, his neighbors, his sister. Who would ever come in (to testify) after this?""
Forchion still awaits trial on marijuana dealing charges, the case from which the witness tampering accusations stemmed.

<p>From our first campaign, we learned that the Birth of Reason emblem deserves to be featured on more items than our egg necklace, and through this realization came our idea for a global marketplace. We also listened to customer feedback from around the world, and learned that our necklace needed to include both sides of the Earth in order to truly be a global symbol - so we are now offering the double sided egg necklace!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>There are a wide variety of issues affecting women today. Throughout the world, women are more likely to live under the poverty level, are more likely to be abused, and also make up the largest part of human trafficking. Women have health issues that are not given the proper funding, have fewer opportunities for education, and consistently lower wages than men, among many other inequalities.</p>
<p>All of these issues are intimately related, and working as a unified whole to address them will help us make more progress on each of them. Currently, we are approaching each of these objectives separately, and what we need in order to make progress is unity.</p>
<p>By creating a unifying symbol, we can build a movement faster and with more power than we ever imagined. Symbols have always been one of the most important ways to communicate belief and affiliation. Icons you see every day often hold powerful meaning. No one questions what you are trying to say if you put your county's flag up on a national holiday, march in a rally with a large peace sign on a banner, or have a rainbow flag flying at your door. Throughout history, countless movements have gained momentum under the influence of unifying symbols.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the unity our cause requires, we need a symbol to match the strength of our values and the strength of our numbers. The heart of our movement is about nurturing (and demanding) empowerment, freedom, education, and opportunity for women throughout the world and ensuring that women’s perspectives are heard. Currently, the women’s movement is lacking a symbol that ties us together, and consequently, we are lacking the collaboration we need. Birth of Reason seeks to remedy both of these issues by promoting a symbol with the power to unify all women and create a sense of collective purpose.</p>
<p>The Birth of Reason symbol is the perfect symbol to represent the women’s movement--the egg expresses women’s power of creation and nurturing, not just of children, but of meaningful thoughts and ideas, while the earth emerging represents the vast power of women to influence the world. We believe that our symbol will perfectly represent our values and serve as the heart of our movement in our pursuit of equality.</p>
<p>Because of this, and our desire to create a truly inclusive and global movement, we’ve decided our signature necklace needs to show all sides of the globe. Our previous design was a huge hit, and we need your help to make this one an even bigger success. Your assistance makes it possible to include all the continents, and further, to dedicate more resources to building our marketplace, which helps more women across the globe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Popularizing the Birth of Reason emblem may be challenging for us, as our success depends on mass exposure and the global adoption of this symbol as the official symbol for the women’s movement. However, we believe that if we move forward with passion and integrity and continue to develop partnerships with powerful women and other influential organizations, our message will be heard and we will be able to achieve our goal helping women gain global unity and a shared voice.</p> <p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways to support our campaign and we welcome them all! If you can’t contribute by ordering a necklace, patch, or tattoo, please consider sharing our campaign with your friends.

These items are temporary tattoos and patches! We have all of these items in stock and they will be shipped to your right away so that you can wear them proudly!


 
The Impact
There are a wide variety of issues affecting women today. Throughout the world, women are more likely to live under the poverty level, are more likely to be abused, and also make up the largest part of human trafficking. Women have health issues that are not given the proper funding, have fewer opportunities for education, and consistently lower wages than men, among many other inequalities.
All of these issues are intimately related, and working as a unified whole to address them will help us make more progress on each of them. Currently, we are approaching each of these objectives separately, and what we need in order to make progress is unity.
By creating a unifying symbol, we can build a movement faster and with more power than we ever imagined. Symbols have always been one of the most important ways to communicate belief and affiliation. Icons you see every day often hold powerful meaning. No one questions what you are trying to say if you put your county's flag up on a national holiday, march in a rally with a large peace sign on a banner, or have a rainbow flag flying at your door. Throughout history, countless movements have gained momentum under the influence of unifying symbols.
In order to achieve the unity our cause requires, we need a symbol to match the strength of our values and the strength of our numbers. The heart of our movement is about nurturing (and demanding) empowerment, freedom, education, and opportunity for women throughout the world and ensuring that women’s perspectives are heard. Currently, the women’s movement is lacking a symbol that ties us together, and consequently, we are lacking the collaboration we need. Birth of Reason seeks to remedy both of these issues by promoting a symbol with the power to unify all women and create a sense of collective purpose.
The Birth of Reason symbol is the perfect symbol to represent the women’s movement--the egg expresses women’s power of creation and nurturing, not just of children, but of meaningful thoughts and ideas, while the earth emerging represents the vast power of women to influence the world. We believe that our symbol will perfectly represent our values and serve as the heart of our movement in our pursuit of equality.
Because of this, and our desire to create a truly inclusive and global movement, we’ve decided our signature necklace needs to show all sides of the globe. Our previous design was a huge hit, and we need your help to make this one an even bigger success. Your assistance makes it possible to include all the continents, and further, to dedicate more resources to building our marketplace, which helps more women across the globe.
 
Risks & Challenges
Popularizing the Birth of Reason emblem may be challenging for us, as our success depends on mass exposure and the global adoption of this symbol as the official symbol for the women’s movement. However, we believe that if we move forward with passion and integrity and continue to develop partnerships with powerful women and other influential organizations, our message will be heard and we will be able to achieve our goal helping women gain global unity and a shared voice. Other Ways You Can Help
There are many ways to support our campaign and we welcome them all! If you can’t contribute by ordering a necklace, patch, or tattoo, please consider sharing our campaign with your friends. Any likes or shares through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. would be very much appreciated!

<h3>Birth Certificates in Rural Senegal</h3>
<p>Birth registration is the continuous and permanent registration of births and their characteristics in a civil status register, in accordance with applicable national legal requirements.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the National Agency for Statistics and Demography (Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Planning, 2015), <strong>nearly a quarter of children (23.8%) aged between 1 and 9 years old have neither birth certificate</strong> nor supplementary judgment.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact: Consequences of Non-Registration</h3>
<p><strong>A interruption or delay in a child's education:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Children without a birth certificate cannot attend school</strong> as enrollment in a school requires the presentation of a birth certificate. Even if a child is accepted into a school on a good faith, they will not be able to take the final exams and prevented from progressing.</li>
<li>As a result, schools end up with many exam candidates excluded due to lack of identification.<ul><li>According to the Director of Examinations and Competitions, in 2015 and 2016 alone, over 85,000 ""candidates for the CFEE (Certificate of end of elementary studies) and the BFEM (Certificate of end of middle studies) were without a civil status certificate. If these thousands of candidates do not manage to obtain a birth certificate before the end of year exams are held, they are forced to wait for the following academic year to take the exams.""</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The loss of their right to health:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In Senegal, the non-registration of a child implies an absence of the right to health care: <strong>without a birth certificate, a child cannot be treated or be vaccinated in a health center</strong>.</li>
<li>Children without an identity can be harder to reach by healthcare workers, and are often overlooked in public health plans even when the health coverage is universal.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exposure to early marriage for girls:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Girls who do not have their birth certificate lack certain protection against early marriage.</li>
<li>Additionally, the health consequences such as early pregnancies can be particularly damaging.</li>
<li>
<strong>Birth registration is important as a means to facilitate monitoring and supporting the implementation and enforcement of minimum age of marriage laws in Senegal</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges: Causes of Non-Registration</h3>
<p><strong>Ignorance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The situation of non-declaration of births results from the negligence of those who's duty it is to declare the child, parents in particular. But these parents are often ignorant of the requirement as many of them do not have birth certificates themselves, especially in rural areas (APS, 2015). </li>
<li>Additionally, free registration of births is ignored by a majority of the population who assumes that birth registration requires payment. The law, however, mandates that the declaration is free and that the tax must be paid only for obtaining the civil status certificate (decree W 89428 of April 22, 1989).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The low level of education </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It has been consistently observed that a parent's education level affects the health and well-being of their family. This also applies to birth registration. In fact, parents who have attended school are more likely than those who have never been to school to better understand the procedures and modalities of birth registration.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the complexities and intricacies of the laws are often known and understood only by an informed public, made up of legal professionals and practitioners. In these circumstances, a population that is largely illiterate lack awareness the existence of the standard, let alone its content.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Poverty</strong></p>
<ul><li>The prevalence of poverty in certain rural areas hinder some parents from prioritizing the declaration of the birth of the children. Indeed, children from the wealthiest backgrounds are more likely to be registered in civil status registers, which confirms the link between poverty and the birth registration rate.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Geographic barriers:</strong></p>
<ul><li>The location of a town or village and their distance from registration centers have a significant impact on birth registration. In other words, longer distance from registration sites correlates to a decrease in birth registration. This is often due to the inability for the nursing mother to travel during the prescribed time or the economic burden presented by requiring the father to be away from work during an extended period. The burden is increased by the cost of travel.</li></ul>

<h3>Project Objectives</h3>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: <strong>Contribute significantly to the resolution of civil status problems in the regions of Fatick and Diourbel in order to encourage children from rural areas to be enrolled in school at the normal age.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Specific objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthen the capacities of intermediaries, coordinators and civil status actors in 20 municipalities made up of 10 villages on average in each;</li>
<li>Inform the populations about the mechanisms for declaring births;</li>
<li>Put in place sustainable capacity for providing the information necessary for solving civil status problems;</li>
<li>Facilitate the organization of fairground hearings in partnership with the municipalities in order to allow unregistered children to obtain birth certificates.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Project Activities and Targets</h3>
<p><strong>This project consists of carrying out an awareness campaign and capacity building activities in the rural areas most affected by the problem of the non-registration of children in civil status.</strong> As part of this project, we will start with a pilot phase by choosing 10 municipalities in the region of Diourbel and 10 in the region of Fatick.</p> <p>The choice of these two regions is based on statistics showing that they are part of regions whose level of possession of birth certificates is below the national average according to the ANSD- 63.4% for the birth certificate and 16.3% for the supplementary judgment (a decision taken by the court to replace an authentic birth certificate that a person must obtain either it was not delivered or was lost).  Indeed, in Diourbel, 25.4% of people (264,668 persons) do not have a birth certificate, and 16.7 % (114,337 persons) in the Fatick region.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Expected Results of the Project</h3>
<ul>
<li>Strengthen the capacities of intermediaries, facilitators and civil status actors in 20 municipalities made up of 10 villages on average each;</li>
<li>Sensitize the populations of rural areas on the mechanisms of birth declaration;</li>
<li>Make available appropriate tools and resources for parents, school directors and village heads to declare the births of newborns in a timely manner;</li>
<li>Facilitate the organization of fairground hearings in partnership with town halls to provide unregistered children to obtain birth certificates.</li>
<li>Significant increase in timely declaration of births and the obtaining of birth certificates in regions served. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Timeline and Budget</h3>
<ul>
<li>We hope to begin the pilot phase of this project in Q3 of 2021, and anticipate that activities for this pilot project will end Q4 of 2022. </li>
<li>Our overall budget proposal is $19,800 - any way that you can help is so greatly appreciated and would help us out tremendously.</li>

In fact, good cops are critical to a successful society. Bad cops however are destructive to society since it creates distrust and hate towards the people we need protecting us. There is an epidemic of bad cops in America. Police in America are often protected even when they violate our rights, murder innocent people, and abuse anyone who won't bow to their demands. They treat their badges like crowns an expect you to bow down to their demands no matter how unconstitutional those demands are. If you don't comply, you will likely be abused verbally, financially, and/or physically. Your property will likely be seized and tickets will be used to punish you financially. In many cases, cops don't care if the case is ever taken up by the courts. Putting you in jail for a weekend is plenty of satisfaction for you not bowing down. On many occasions I have had nearly a dozen police surround me and verbally berate me as they walk around my vehicle looking for some reason to seize my property. All because I flex my Constitution right and refuse to be victimized. Let's unite, learn together, and fight back together! Police abuse can be stopped!

If the cop proves to be a good cop, we will highlight that and let the world know. Good cops need to be given credit when they actual protect and serve us.

In California, (where we plan to operate Police Stings) we have a civil code (CCC 1708) that states every citizen (including cops) have an unwritten contract to not violate each others rights or property. When a cop abuses someone unconstitutionally, they aren't acting within their police powers and aren't protected from civil action. Police Stings will sue those cops as individuals not as police officers. Police officers can legally violate our rights. If individual state laws don't provide an option to sue for violations of rights, then we will turn to to the federal statutes. 42 USC 1983 allows for anyone (other than judges) to be sued in federal court if they violate any of your rights. <br/>
</li></ul><ul><li>To help individuals gather evidence of police abuse, PoliceStings.com will create an app that allows you to record police officers. You have a constitutional right to record police while they perform their public duties.

The app we are creating will lock the phone's systems, preventing it from being shut off.  The video and audio will be streamed live to our servers and recorded remotely should there be a need for future legal action. The app will only allow the phone to be shut off if the owner enters a password. No longer will police be able to shut your phone off once the abuse starts (I've had them do it to me).

During the lawsuits we will document each step of the process, creating a step by step DIY (do it yourself) process that allows even the poorest among us to file their own lawsuits against abusive police. We'll show you how to get waivers for court fees. Teach you what documents you need to file and when you need to file them.

<p><strong>Attention friends!</strong></p>
<p>We are here to attract your attention towards a snowballing problem. We solicit your help and support to assist Lebanese youths and refugees located in Lebanon, so that they can start something to earn from their own. Basically, we need to help them with seed money.  We have launched a robust platform for this noble cause under the name of Namllat.com. We are here not to help tens of thousands of needy peoples but the target is much beyond hundreds of thousands. To introduce ourselves, we at Namllat.com a Lebanese start-up have come up with an innovative Community Services Platform, creating a plethora of opportunities for the youngsters and refugees.  Knowing the present condition of Lebanon and its refuse problem, Namllat.com is offering various opportunities. By realizing the fact that, it’s a cruel and difficult world to survive, and even more difficult to find suitable jobs, especially in current difficulties in the Lebanese economic situation, we have many things to offer for the betterment of the society. In this respect, we request you to help us to cater the current needs of Lebanese Youths and Refugees. We just cannot leave them for dying from starvation or migrate to other country thus we are seeing refugees die on “Death Boats” daily. Please help us to succeed in directly help the community. We are offering various types of models apart from the regular jobs or even freelancing, through our platform. “Namllat” Online Freelancing Platform- with section especially designed to help Lebanese Community “Youth, Citizens &amp; Refugees"".</p>
<p><strong>Ambition of Namllat</strong></p>
<p>Our ambition is to provide a well-organized, easy to navigate, ethical, one stop online platform for Lebanese Youth, Citizens and Refugees job seekers for all types of jobs under one umbrella. It is an alternative to a full-time job which is very difficult to get. The Lebanese youth, unemployed citizens and refugees would act as “service providers” and community members would be acting as “Clients” through the Namllat platform, which is win - win situation for both.</p>
<p><strong>Our USP</strong></p>
<p>We want to give Lebanese Youth and Refugees free registration along with 140 USD as credit to start up their services. So, whatever fund is raised through this crowd funding will be used to help more and more needy Youths &amp; Refugees. Our ultimate ambition is making our community respected and self-dependent. At the same time, the clients will be enlisted at the platform and will be able to get their work done by the service providers paving the way to lean toward the better economic status.</p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>
<p>Namllat is dedicated in bringing out the best and most productive in our Lebanese Youth, turning disadvantaged of unemployed individuals into contributing community members. As an employer (community member), it offers employment opportunities in the form of part time positions.</p>
<div>We assist refugees to survive in Lebanon as hosting community, not travelling by death boats to Europe. Namllat vows to help those refugees directly or indirectly through the community services to avoid discrimination until the time come to return back to their countries.</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559678804/fw9um8sf9wmgbldvet5z.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The platform of Namllat not only encourages youth, but also provides the way they can pave their path for becoming an entrepreneur. This is guaranteed by the free registration as well as the free credit of 140 USD – it gives a way of efficient head start. Not only is the platform and this project beneficial for the unemployed youth, but it also makes refugees’ and Lebanese people’s lives much easier and utilize technology for their benefits.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559678900/ho4jaabf1hoaacifttlz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The condition of Lebanon</strong></p>
<p>With 164 refugees per 1,000 inhabitants in the small country is the densest and need immediate attention. Not only does the country have refugees from Syria, Iraq and Palestine, but there is also discordance among the people. This is owing to the facts that this refugee situation has burdened and pressurized the government on services and infrastructure, birthing a huge competition over jobs, leading to unemployment. Lebanon has a weakening infrastructure by now, with a large portion of people not even getting the life they wanted, starting from employment.</p>
<p>The Government of Lebanon is helpless on the onslaught of refugees from many countries around. It might be their duty to provide employment, but then, with such an economic instability in the region, the government can do nothing but become a silent spectator in the unfolding scenario. It doesn’t help the situation that Lebanon has been proclaimed as the quintessential country for providing refugee to the people who are in the desperate need of that. This has led to a high risk of social problems, including social chaos and unrest. It also doesn’t sound good when people say that 30% of the Lebanese graduates in the country are still looking for jobs.</p>

<p> </p>
</div>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p>If you cannot participate by giving money, we request you just to recommend your friends to participate with us, or share this on your social media. If not and you live in Lebanon just register on <a href=""http://www.namllat.com/lebanon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.namllat.com/lebanon</a> and get your work done along with helping unemployed Lebanese or Refugee “Note the Youth or Refugee will be clearly marked on our system”.</p>
<p><br/>Namllat needs the help, not for themselves, but for the people. We must start this project as soon as possible “every minute counts for us to help more” The unemployed find this platform highly beneficial, as otherwise, not one of them could’ve found any way of getting employed and simultaneously support themselves and their families. The support and funds that the others would do, including you, would be promptly and swiftly given over to the unemployed youth students as free credit to start their career and earn some money which will directly affect their families and part of it will be for actual start up by recruiting some youth and refugees to start promoting namllat platform to their peers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Needed:   70,000 $ Helping 500 Refugees and Youth (First Stage).</p>
<p>                   18,000 $ Recruiting 6 Lebanese Youth &amp; Refugee to spread the word for 6 months.</p>
<p>                  <u>5,000 $</u> Final Development of Namllat Platform.</p>
<p><strong>Total    93,000 $</strong></p>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>In nut shell</strong></p>
<p>Namllat believes that suffering of even one human is suffering inflicted on whole of the humanity. One should willingly volunteer to stop such suffering when need occurs. Here, the Lebanese residents, comprising of youth, unemployed citizens and refugees, would be the one providing services – also known as service providers. The community members would then be acting as clients – as someone who needs their jobs done, from these service providers. Namllat platform will make it possible to help the unemployed as well as the people seeking job completion, through its provision of freelancing jobs.</p>
<p>So, on the behalf of the suffering Lebanese people and our community, namllat appeals you to join this noble cause – let’s transform the suffering country to a happy one!</p>

The Lebanese youth, unemployed citizens and refugees would act as “service providers” and community members would be acting as “Clients” through the Namllat platform, which is win - win situation for both.
Our USP
We want to give Lebanese Youth and Refugees free registration along with 140 USD as credit to start up their services. So, whatever fund is raised through this crowd funding will be used to help more and more needy Youths & Refugees. Our ultimate ambition is making our community respected and self-dependent. At the same time, the clients will be enlisted at the platform and will be able to get their work done by the service providers paving the way to lean toward the better economic status.
Impact
Namllat is dedicated in bringing out the best and most productive in our Lebanese Youth, turning disadvantaged of unemployed individuals into contributing community members. As an employer (community member), it offers employment opportunities in the form of part time positions.
We assist refugees to survive in Lebanon as hosting community, not travelling by death boats to Europe. Namllat vows to help those refugees directly or indirectly through the community services to avoid discrimination until the time come to return back to their countries.

The platform of Namllat not only encourages youth, but also provides the way they can pave their path for becoming an entrepreneur. This is guaranteed by the free registration as well as the free credit of 140 USD – it gives a way of efficient head start. Not only is the platform and this project beneficial for the unemployed youth, but it also makes refugees’ and Lebanese people’s lives much easier and utilize technology for their benefits.

The condition of Lebanon
With 164 refugees per 1,000 inhabitants in the small country is the densest and need immediate attention. Not only does the country have refugees from Syria, Iraq and Palestine, but there is also discordance among the people. This is owing to the facts that this refugee situation has burdened and pressurized the government on services and infrastructure, birthing a huge competition over jobs, leading to unemployment. Lebanon has a weakening infrastructure by now, with a large portion of people not even getting the life they wanted, starting from employment.
The Government of Lebanon is helpless on the onslaught of refugees from many countries around. It might be their duty to provide employment, but then, with such an economic instability in the region, the government can do nothing but become a silent spectator in the unfolding scenario. It doesn’t help the situation that Lebanon has been proclaimed as the quintessential country for providing refugee to the people who are in the desperate need of that. This has led to a high risk of social problems, including social chaos and unrest. It also doesn’t sound good when people say that 30% of the Lebanese graduates in the country are still looking for jobs.


 

What we need
If you cannot participate by giving money, we request you just to recommend your friends to participate with us, or share this on your social media. If not and you live in Lebanon just register on www.namllat.com/lebanon and get your work done along with helping unemployed Lebanese or Refugee “Note the Youth or Refugee will be clearly marked on our system”.
Namllat needs the help, not for themselves, but for the people. We must start this project as soon as possible “every minute counts for us to help more” The unemployed find this platform highly beneficial, as otherwise, not one of them could’ve found any way of getting employed and simultaneously support themselves and their families. The support and funds that the others would do, including you, would be promptly and swiftly given over to the unemployed youth students as free credit to start their career and earn some money which will directly affect their families and part of it will be for actual start up by recruiting some youth and refugees to start promoting namllat platform to their peers.
 
Needed:   70,000 $ Helping 500 Refugees and Youth (First Stage).
                   18,000 $ Recruiting 6 Lebanese Youth & Refugee to spread the word for 6 months.
                  5,000 $ Final Development of Namllat Platform.
Total    93,000 $
 
 
In nut shell
Namllat believes that suffering of even one human is suffering inflicted on whole of the humanity. One should willingly volunteer to stop such suffering when need occurs. Here, the Lebanese residents, comprising of youth, unemployed citizens and refugees, would be the one providing services – also known as service providers. The community members would then be acting as clients – as someone who needs their jobs done, from these service providers. Namllat platform will make it possible to help the unemployed as well as the people seeking job completion, through its provision of freelancing jobs.
So, on the behalf of the suffering Lebanese people and our community, namllat appeals you to join this noble cause – let’s transform the suffering country to a happy one!

<h3>Our {Collective} Impact</h3>
<p>Detroit Parent Collective is designed to be inclusive of Detroit's families with a special emphasis on crossing barriers based on socioeconomic class, race and ethnicity. DPC is committed to offering a co-working space with onsite childcare and cooperative preschool, with supportive programming based on families’ expressed needs. While this work seems daunting, it's actually quite rewarding. Many of our Families (Collective Members) come from different walks of lives and that's what makes this space so beautiful! Without much effort we are removing barriers and finding similarities versus differences among each other. <i><strong>In other words, we are bridging two worlds; </strong></i>one where families would less likely have the opportunity or space to engage + learn from one another-- there's a very good chance that this is why we've been able to retain 90% of our Members since we launched mid-October 2017. {‌{Thank You Collective Members}‌}</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

<li>This campaign is important since, in Spain, there is still a Catholic monopoly, which has left in the collective imagination old ideas of their own.

<li>With the adequate funding, we can rent a place and found a church dedicated to the main objectives of the campaign: women, whether heterosexual, lesbian or trans, as well as those believers who follow the principle that God is love.</li>

<li>As rewards, apart from being a help in this noble project, we will put a stone slab with the names of those people who have helped. The slab will have a header on which will put ""this project has been possible thanks to ..."" and will be at the entrance of the Church so that anyone can read it and know thanks to who has been possible. We will send a photo when the slab stone is finished to every backer.

<li>The funds go, entirely, to the creation of the Church and everything that it entails: paperwork, rent, hiring if necessary, purchase of material, financing to help people (for example, in Barcelona, there are more than 6000 people homeless and many elderly people without resources to survive looking for sustenance in the garbage)</li>
