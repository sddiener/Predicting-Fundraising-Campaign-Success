<h3>Our Solution +  Invention </h3>
<p>To Design a Keyboard that all users can use would be to use a premium aluminium Alloy material which is light , durable and classy.  This way , everyone can type comfortably onto the keyboard without any worry of damaging. </p>
<p>We also need to come out with a mechanism where the keyboard can be folded in the best and fastest way while we integrate the wireless mouse inside together.  The rotational joint and the soft sponge will cushion the folding mechanism when you fold so it will not damage the keyboard which also has a Auto-On off switch when you close and open the keyboard. </p>
<ul>
<li>Foldable Keyboard ( 2 Ply ) </li>
<li>Wired / WIreless ( Up to 3 Devices ) </li>
<li>Shortcut Toggle Buttons to toggle between 3 devices </li>
<li>Balancing Mechanism at the bottom </li>
<li>Wireless Tracking Mouse </li>
<li>Extendable  &amp; Hidden Phone Stands to convert into work station </li>
</ul>
<h3>Our Idea towards to the User </h3>
<p>We want to create the ideal keyboard for everyone to use regardless indoor or outdoors. We want to give the safe and assurance feeling for our customers so that they do not need to worry about bringing the mouse and squeezing the Chunky keyboards into the bag . </p>
<p>WIth its ability to pair up to 3 devices and phone stand, users can transform any tablets and phones into Mini Laptop configuration while still being able to type onto the desktops . </p>
<ul>
<li>Bring the Keyboard anyway you go</li>
<li>Look Good &amp; Classy with this Gadget </li>
<li>Able to Slot into Pockets </li>
<li>Forget about the hustle of Wireless Mouse </li>
<li>Able to turn the keyboard into Work station </li>
</ul>

<h3>The Outlook </h3>
<p>We do not want to create a keyboard using ABS and Plastic material where it would look cheap and damage easily with knocks and dents. Therefore we use a premium titanium metallic material where it is classy , stylish and light. This way people can carry it easily without the fear of damage and outlook . </p>

<h3>Sturdy &amp; Durable Extendable Phone Stands </h3>
<p>We do not want a phone stand that is weak and incompetent to hold a Phone &amp; Tablet. Therefore we use a robust ABS material to hold your phones intact. The distance of the stands are calculated where you can put tablets and phones at the same time without interference . </p>

<p><strong>Wireless Track Mouse </strong></p>
<p>Firstly most Foldable wireless keyboard doesn't comes with mouse . Even if it comes, it does not have the left and right click separately similar to a wireless Mouse. Therefore we pack a real wireless mouse into the keyboard where users can move around and click for the data they want</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensitive finger Cursor</li>
<li>Left and Right Click </li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494932899/z3ecwnshbnz2bgkrpsuh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Safety Contacts With Magnet Mechanism </strong></p>
<p>Creating a Keyboard has to be safe and extremely easy to users to use. Therefore we introduce soft contact points for protection and use magnet mechanism to ensure the keyboard intact in different situations </p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic Off &amp; On by Folding</li>

The Current Keyboard Problem 
Our wireless keyboards does not always have the best of the worlds as it is either too heavy, too big , too slow and its incompatibility to pair with Multiple computers.  Not to mention, keyboards doesn't comes with wireless mouse . 

 Bulky , Heavy & Inconvenient 
Long Untidy Wires Dangling around 
Unbalanced & Tilt to either side while Typing 
Troublesome Switching Power Button 
Either suited for Computer or Mobile Phones 
Inability to pair with New and Multiple  Devices 
No Compatibility with wireless Mouse



Our Solution +  Invention 
To Design a Keyboard that all users can use would be to use a premium aluminium Alloy material which is light , durable and classy.  This way , everyone can type comfortably onto the keyboard without any worry of damaging. 
We also need to come out with a mechanism where the keyboard can be folded in the best and fastest way while we integrate the wireless mouse inside together.  The rotational joint and the soft sponge will cushion the folding mechanism when you fold so it will not damage the keyboard which also has a Auto-On off switch when you close and open the keyboard. 

Foldable Keyboard ( 2 Ply ) 
Wired / WIreless ( Up to 3 Devices ) 
Shortcut Toggle Buttons to toggle between 3 devices 
Balancing Mechanism at the bottom 
Wireless Tracking Mouse 
Extendable  & Hidden Phone Stands to convert into work station 

Our Idea towards to the User 
We want to create the ideal keyboard for everyone to use regardless indoor or outdoors. We want to give the safe and assurance feeling for our customers so that they do not need to worry about bringing the mouse and squeezing the Chunky keyboards into the bag .

Therefore we use a premium titanium metallic material where it is classy , stylish and light. This way people can carry it easily without the fear of damage and outlook . 

Premium Metallic Material 
Anti Rust & Oxidation protection 
 Locking Magnet Mechanism to prevent it from opening 



Use it Anytime Any Where You want

Safety Distance between the 2 Stands
Strong Sturdy ABS Extendable Stands 



Wireless Track Mouse

Sensitive finger Cursor

Safety Contacts With Magnet Mechanism 
Creating a Keyboard has to be safe and extremely easy to users to use. Therefore we introduce soft contact points for protection and use magnet mechanism to ensure the keyboard intact in different situations

<p>As a frequent traveler and phone addict, I often use my cell phone for entertainment on aircraft, trains, and even buses. I held my phone upright, sometimes for hours, so I could view my screen at the correct angle. Doing it this way was inconvenient, and it didn't always provide the best view, but it was the only option I had. After doing this for a short time, I started to experience severe neck strain (known as ""text-neck"") and I also began to lose feeling in my left hand, from my elbow pressing into the arm rest. When I looked around me on the plane, train, or bus, I saw that my fellow travelers were all in the same situation. They had bent necks and were struggling to hold their phones upright for viewing, especially while eating!</p>
<p>My discomfort finally became so great, that I knew I had to do something about it. Naturally, I did what anyone would do. I searched the Internet for a product that would hold my phone for me while traveling, but I couldn't find a single one that provided the features I needed. I wanted to elevate my phone so my neck would be straight instead of constantly bent forward. I also wanted a device that would work across multiple travel systems and situations, and lastly, I wanted it to travel and use easily. There wasn't a single one on the market that had all of these features. So, I invented one! VuWing was created for me and you, Enjoy your trip!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">To maximize our success, there are several hurdles we must overcome as a company. We are currently working hard with our partners to consolidate production plans and coordinate third-party vendors. Despite spending the last two years building an efficient supply chain, we may run into component delays or unexpected shortage s. An international logistical risk is present as our product contains a battery which is more difficult to ship internationally. Therefore, the speed and price of shipping may affect the number of units we are able to deliver to each country. If this occurs then we will keep the community informed while doing our best to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>Ligo is an mobile app and website service that provides virtual business cards for social and professional networking. Our team is made up of college and high school students with varying interests from computer science, to finance, to digital marketing and design. Our team hails from colleges including Cornell, Columbia, Dartmouth, Yale, Tufts, Boston College, Wash U, Northwestern, Richmond, and more. However, as students, we need funding to make our vision a reality. Ligo has been in development for over a year, and we are finally ready to bring it to market, but we need your help!</p>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>Ligo needs funding to cover marketing, development, and legal costs.</li>
<li>Our funding campaign has five tiers that you can contribute through:<ul>
<li>Tier one: With a donation of $20, you'll receive a white Ligo T-shirt</li>
<li>Tier two: With a donation of $35, you'll receive a whiteLigo T-shirt and a Ligo mask</li>
<li>Tier three: With a donation of $50, you'll receive a white Ligo T-shirt, a Ligo mask, and a Ligo hat.</li>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Ligo provides a shareable 'card' embedded with the user's virtual identity. Users can add their social media accounts, websites, contact information, and other online presences to their Ligocard, which they can then share from a socially appropriate distance via QR Code, AirDrop, URL Code, or In-App Search. In an increasingly contactless and tenchologically driven world, Ligo transcends the classic idea of a business card by combining traditional networking with an intuitive and modern take on social identity. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Ligo currently faces four major competitors with similar goals. However, their services range from $4.99 to $34.99, and some of our competitors require external hardware to run their services, whether that's a bulb on the back of the phone or a completely separate physical, electronic card, Ligo offers a more simplistic, accessible, and sustainable product. Ligo's sleek, simple, and effective design is free for everyone to use in social and professional settings with no external hardware. </p>

<h3>2. Why we need Kratos</h3>
<div>""I've installed many apps on my phone and there isn't much space left""</div>
<div>""I want to<span style=""background-color: initial;""> take video and pictures with high quality, but I don't have enough space on my phone""</span>
</div>
<div>""I prefer to use my phone to watch movie, listen to the music while I'm on the travel""</div>
<div>""I'm sick to upload and download data in poor network status""</div>
<div>...</div>
<div>There is a lot of cases that you feel the lack of storage space on your phone or laptop. Also it really drives us crazy when we have poor network status.</div>
<div>Of course, you can purchase device which has more storage space. But here is how much you need to pay to increase.</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455862913/segjatofdugx3b6ri7vh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/><p></p>
<br/>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the price
for additional storage space is really expensive.</p>

Kratos can solve this issue. It can provide up to 512GB additional storage space for your devices.<br/> </div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456130387/k0aeypbvttowltzeozdc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Also
Kratos supports streaming to multiple devices and it means all of your devices can
extend storage space by using just one Kratos.</span></p>

<p></p>
</div><div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Using
this functionality, you can also share data with nearby people and devices, so it will be a great

<p>Currently, SanDisk Wireless Stick has largest storage space (200GB), but Kratos can provide 312GB more than that.</p>

<p><b>-<span>  </span>the Cheapest

<p>(Our retail price will be $119 for 256GB and $ 169 for 512GB model)</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>- Support Dual Band Wi-Fi</b></p>
<p>Existing
models only support 2.4GHz band width. But Kratos supports dual band (2.4GHz and 5GHz both) and it can solve interference issue, so we can increase transfer speed and reliability. Also 5GHz bandwidth is good for <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">video streaming.</span></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>-<span> Kratos provides high</span> speed via wire and Wi-Fi</b></p>

<p>Of course, Wi-Fi transmission is heavily effected by environment, but we've tested it all the devices in same environment.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>-<span>  Easy to find using beep functionality</span></b></p>
<p>Have you ever lost the memory and spend a lot of time to find it? You don't worry about that with Kratos. Kratos has ability to raise alarm, so user can find it easily. You can raise alaram by using app with your phone.</p>

</div></div>","Hello contributors, we re-posted new campaign here, so please contribute there.

Here is our New Kratos Campaign

Thank you.





Best
wireless flash drive with large storage and low price. It is small in size, simple to use, can be shared between multiple devices and support all your devices - iOS, Android, Mac OS and Windows.




1. Product Overview






2. Why we need Kratos
""I've installed many apps on my phone and there isn't much space left""
""I want to take video and pictures with high quality, but I don't have enough space on my phone""

""I prefer to use my phone to watch movie, listen to the music while I'm on the travel""
""I'm sick to upload and download data in poor network status""
...
There is a lot of cases that you feel the lack of storage space on your phone or laptop. Also it really drives us crazy when we have poor network status.
Of course, you can purchase device which has more storage space. But here is how much you need to pay to increase.







As you can see, the price
for additional storage space is really expensive.

Kratos can solve this issue. It can provide up to 512GB additional storage space for your devices. 




Also
Kratos supports streaming to multiple devices and it means all of your devices can
extend storage space by using just one Kratos.



Using
this functionality, you can also share data with nearby people and devices, so it will be a great
tool for your presentation, meeting, discussion, etc.

      

Sometimes you feel that your device doesn’t have enough usb port for the peripherals (for example, MacBook only has one usb port). Kratos can be a good choice for such devices.




3. Advantage
 - Kratos provides more storage space than any other existing wireless
flash drive.


Currently, SanDisk Wireless Stick has largest storage space (200GB), but Kratos can provide 312GB more than that.

-  the Cheapest
Wireless Flash Drive ever.



(Our retail price will be $119 for 256GB and $ 169 for 512GB model)

- Support Dual Band Wi-Fi
Existing
models only support 2.4GHz band width. But Kratos supports dual band (2.4GHz and 5GHz both) and it can solve interference issue, so we can increase transfer speed and reliability. Also 5GHz bandwidth is good for video streaming.

- Kratos provides high speed via wire and Wi-Fi

Of course, Wi-Fi transmission is heavily effected by environment, but we've tested it all the devices in same environment.

-  Easy to find using beep functionality
Have you ever lost the memory and spend a lot of time to find it? You don't worry about that with Kratos. Kratos has ability to raise alarm, so user can find it easily. You can raise alaram by using app with your phone.

- 
Simple to use and powerful application
(support iOS, Android, Mac Os and Windows) 
You can see our app in the video.

your smartphone. </p>
<p>Our team's founder is Val Spiridonov who is
a professional engineer and 3D designer – he knows firsthand how useful a
device like this can be. In addition, we have a team of over 30 people working
on this project who have backgrounds ranging from advanced robotics development
to application programming. We need funding to develop this project
commercially and make this device accessible to as many people as possible.
Instead of developing a whole new electric wheelchair, this device will attach

is designed to work flawlessly indoors. Our goal is to make a system that is
very affordable and easy to use. We don't anticipate that it will cost more
than 250$ when it is on the market. This system works as 3 separate components:</p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span>The device itself, which will
attach to an electric wheelchair and enable autonomous movement.</p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span>IR Blasters with cameras that
will serve to map out your indoor space and track where you are to avoid
collisions. </p>
<p>3.<span> 
</span>An application on your

<p>The most important aspect of the autopilot
wheelchair system is to make sure that no collision happens and that the user
always has control of the device. The user will always be able to resume manual
control at any time. In order to avoid collisions and make accurate adjustments
in real time, we've looked at various VR headsets for inspiration. Most Virtual
reality headsets on the market today employ some type of tracking technology,
so that the headset knows the position of the user. This is especially needed
when you're using room scale VR. </p>
<p>The great thing about this is that we can
use the same type of technology for the autopilot wheelchair system. IR
blasters will map out your room space in real time and attached cameras will
track where you are in your room. From there, you can use your application to
set destinations in your living space. Then, all you need to do is tell the
application where to go. You can do this via voice input or by tapping on your
smartphone. Both options are significantly easier than having to manipulate a
cumbersome joystick. In many cases, people cannot use their hands anymore, so a
system like this could help immensely. </p>

people with disabilities like Valery. We made headlines all over the world
because we are exploring the possibilities of feasible head transplantation
within a period of 5-10 years.Alexey is
the founder of Promobot. He has over 12 years of experience in developing
robots. Alexey was named in Forbes' list of the top 30 European technology
entrepreneurs. He has a PhD In Technical Sciences.
Why Indiegogo?

We have a great team in place and the
technical knowledge needed to complete this project, but we need financing to
make a commercial model and bring this system to the commercial market. We have
prototypes in development and the technology in place to make this project
work, but we need financing to make sure that this project goes from prototype
to a completed commercial and affordable system. Our team looked at a lot of
options for financing and by far the best way to make sure that we make a
system that places priority on ease of use and affordability is to use
crowdfunding. This way, we are free to make the system that we envisioned. 
By supporting us, you're helping to create
a system that has the potential to help hundreds of thousands of people with
disabilities. 
How much time do you need to release the autopilot
wheelchair system?

Our timeline is to deliver the autopilot
wheelchair system within 12 months for Indiegogo backers. It takes time to
manufacture the IR Blasters with cameras and the device itself on a larger
scale. With that in mind, it will take us 14-16 months to deliver orders for
non Indiegogo buyers. 
We will need to finish the application
itself and develop a commercial model form our prototype, so we don't want to
misinform you and give you an overly optimistic timeline. This is why we gave
you the timeline above. We will always keep you updated and plan to continue
updating the Indiegogo project after it ends to keep backers informed.If you personally don't need a device like
this – think or remember that probably in your circle of friends or in your
neighborhood, you will find a guy or a girl who fights everyday with their
disability and with their wheelchair's joystick.",16.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p> </p>
</div><p>Hello everyone. I'm Crystal Cheatham. You may remember me as the creator of the IDentity Kit for Queer Christian Youth, or the queer Christian folk singer that passed through your town once upon a time a million years ago. I'm also the gal around town writing queer faith articles for the Philadelphia Gay Newspaper, HuffPo, The New Civil Rights Movement and other online publications. But I think most of you know me as the most beautiful and hilarious person you've ever met. Ok, just playing. That's definitely wishful thinking.</p><p>In all of my writing, singing and performing I've been candid about my time growing up in a fundamentalist church and how confusing it was to come out and deal with that whole clusterf@ck of a second puberty. I've devoted so much of my life to helping others in that position realize that yes, their higher power does love them and that they too deserve the quietude and serenity that comes with being a person of faith.</p><p>Every week I get an email or a Facebook post from someone who has seen my Driftwood video or stumbled upon the IDentity Kit and they are looking for answers--answers that I alone cannot give. It's not just the LGBT community looking for affirmation. There are a whole bunch of us with complex identities that don't fit into a fundamentalist mold but do identify somewhere along the spectrum between Christian, spiritual and agnostic. What I know is that we as an international community are hungry for books and media that affirm who we are and how we live our lives. With that on my heart as a primary motivator I've decided to put together Our Bible app. I believe it is the best way to unify us world wide, and set in the light those messages we've all been craving to hear. This way we will all have access to podcasts, devotionals, videos, Bible texts and a community that is out there to inspire and lift us up. I hope you see what I see. I hope you'll help me build this. So you too can read, pray and meditate in peace.</p><h3>Our Bible App:</h3><ul>
<li>A library of affirming &amp; diverse devotionals written by some of the leading voices in affirming &amp; accepting Christianity</li>
<li>A calendar progress bar that helps you keep up on your daily devotionals so that you can start your own daily plans and follow them for a few days, weeks or months.</li>
<li>Multiple Bible translations and daily verses with the ability to highlight, copy and paste</li>
<li>Access to podcasts, videos &amp; articles</li>
<li>A community board where you can invite friends &amp; build community</li>
</ul><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_ZVRKQMUYs?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h3>THE PROBLEM:  </h3><p>I don't know about you but I get frustrated when I go to the Christian section of a bookstore and amongst the hundreds and thousands of books, there are none that feel like they are talking to me. None of us is defined by one or two identities, but conservative Christianity today seems to believe we are all the same person with the same needs, wants and desires. (By the way I'm a black, female, lesbian and that's a pretty tall order to fill when looking for something that speaks to me.) </p><p>Devotionals on friendships, romantic relationships, family, love, life journeys and others are all geared towards a very specific kind of Christian, and in today's society that brand of conservative fundamentalist Christianity is seemingly less and less Christlike. It doesn't appeal to LGBT people, their allies, feminists, agnostics, people who feel more spiritual than religious or even folks who just want wise words to meditate on. Instead what is offered is so heteronormative, judgy, shaming and well... political. What's more, those devotionals parcel the true language of the Bible to fit certain molds of faith and worship and let's face it. The Bible doesn't say just one thing about anything.

For the rest of us. 

 
Hello everyone. I'm Crystal Cheatham. You may remember me as the creator of the IDentity Kit for Queer Christian Youth, or the queer Christian folk singer that passed through your town once upon a time a million years ago. I'm also the gal around town writing queer faith articles for the Philadelphia Gay Newspaper, HuffPo, The New Civil Rights Movement and other online publications. But I think most of you know me as the most beautiful and hilarious person you've ever met. Ok, just playing. That's definitely wishful thinking.In all of my writing, singing and performing I've been candid about my time growing up in a fundamentalist church and how confusing it was to come out and deal with that whole clusterf@ck of a second puberty. I've devoted so much of my life to helping others in that position realize that yes, their higher power does love them and that they too deserve the quietude and serenity that comes with being a person of faith.Every week I get an email or a Facebook post from someone who has seen my Driftwood video or stumbled upon the IDentity Kit and they are looking for answers--answers that I alone cannot give. It's not just the LGBT community looking for affirmation. There are a whole bunch of us with complex identities that don't fit into a fundamentalist mold but do identify somewhere along the spectrum between Christian, spiritual and agnostic. What I know is that we as an international community are hungry for books and media that affirm who we are and how we live our lives. With that on my heart as a primary motivator I've decided to put together Our Bible app. I believe it is the best way to unify us world wide, and set in the light those messages we've all been craving to hear. This way we will all have access to podcasts, devotionals, videos, Bible texts and a community that is out there to inspire and lift us up. I hope you see what I see. I hope you'll help me build this. So you too can read, pray and meditate in peace.Our Bible App:
A library of affirming & diverse devotionals written by some of the leading voices in affirming & accepting Christianity
A calendar progress bar that helps you keep up on your daily devotionals so that you can start your own daily plans and follow them for a few days, weeks or months.
Multiple Bible translations and daily verses with the ability to highlight, copy and paste
Access to podcasts, videos & articles
A community board where you can invite friends & build community
THE PROBLEM:  I don't know about you but I get frustrated when I go to the Christian section of a bookstore and amongst the hundreds and thousands of books, there are none that feel like they are talking to me. None of us is defined by one or two identities, but conservative Christianity today seems to believe we are all the same person with the same needs, wants and desires. (By the way I'm a black, female, lesbian and that's a pretty tall order to fill when looking for something that speaks to me.) Devotionals on friendships, romantic relationships, family, love, life journeys and others are all geared towards a very specific kind of Christian, and in today's society that brand of conservative fundamentalist Christianity is seemingly less and less Christlike. It doesn't appeal to LGBT people, their allies, feminists, agnostics, people who feel more spiritual than religious or even folks who just want wise words to meditate on. Instead what is offered is so heteronormative, judgy, shaming and well... political. What's more, those devotionals parcel the true language of the Bible to fit certain molds of faith and worship and let's face it. The Bible doesn't say just one thing about anything. There are as many narratives as there are identities and we need to honor that! The truth is, there are people writing affirming and inclusive devotionals, but you won't find them in a Christian bookstore. THE FIX: In response to this I've created a Bible app that caters to the rest of us; the Christians who are queer, straight, and generally identify as the Other kind of Christian. We want to explore the Bible through narratives that are inclusive of our identities and whom God made us to be. We are often seen as the outsiders, but we too need devotionals and worship materials that theologize our particular human experiences. Our Bible app is just that.  That's where you come in. In order to get this app to the next level I need your help. I need, want, am crazy about raising the funds I need to make this app appear on your phone.

<p><b>My idea, in short, is to develop a mobile payment app for grocery shoppers</b> that would:</p>

<p>Scan, apply, review, and pay. That's it.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>To develop this mobile payment app, the amount of funding I'll need is at least $75K. Here's why:</div>
<div>
<span>1. First, I need to find a partner in the grocery store business who is willing to be a part of this mobile payment app platform and provide price lists and any other pertinent information to the app's database. This will likely require some type of monetary agreement whereby they receive a portion of the app's revenue generated primarily from app downloads and advertisements/promotional pop-ups paid for by food manufacturers.</span><br/>
</div>
<div>2. I need to hire IT professionals who are experienced with programming, testing and debugging, infrastructure, databases, and design.</div>
<div>3. I need to advertise this mobile app to grocery shoppers and owners, which will require social media presence as well as TV ads and any other form of advertising.</div>
<div>So now, what do you get in return?</div>
<div>- $5 investment: A big thank you for your support in revolutionizing the grocery shopping experience!!</div>
<div>-$25 investment: Free download of the app in the app store as well as a possible coupon to be applied on your first virtual grocery store experience!</div>
<div>-$100 investment: Free download of the app in the app store, possible coupon, and a place in one of the TV, newspaper, or billboard ads!</div>
<div>-$2,500 investment: Be a part of my team to develop this mobile payment app !!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This mobile payment app for grocery shopping will affect just about EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. The majority of us go to the grocery store for food and other items, and the majority of us wait in lines even if we only have 5-10 items to check in. Let's streamline the grocery shopping process by developing scan-as-you-go technology that will put the power of shopping in the consumer's hands that will allow them to save money, time, and headaches. Furthermore, let's put an end to cutting out coupons out of the grocery store's weekly newspaper by automating the process. Why do the manual work that requires more time and effort when you can just sign up for sale alerts and promotions going on based on your location and your shopping history?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The primary risk with completing this project is that I will be learning (a lot) on the go. I am not new to putting all of my time and energy into an effort that I knew could be a game-changer, but yes, I am new to the actual development of an app from scratch. However, I am extremely confident that with a little bit of time and connecting, I can create a winning formula. I've been a part of one before, see below link for when my team won first place at a social innovation design competition in college (2011 - Clean2O):</p>

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Assist</h3>
</div><div>Spread the word to your friends and family whether it be in person or on social media. Hell, tell it to the random guy sitting next to you on the train or in the bar. A revolution is coming...the long lines and waits in the grocery store are coming to an end...savings in time and money both for the consumer and the business owner are on the horizon...and that person who cancels a purchase in front of you because he/she thought it was on sale but it really wasn't?

3. I need to advertise this mobile app to grocery shoppers and owners, which will require social media presence as well as TV ads and any other form of advertising.
So now, what do you get in return?
- $5 investment: A big thank you for your support in revolutionizing the grocery shopping experience!!
-$25 investment: Free download of the app in the app store as well as a possible coupon to be applied on your first virtual grocery store experience!
-$100 investment: Free download of the app in the app store, possible coupon, and a place in one of the TV, newspaper, or billboard ads!
-$2,500 investment: Be a part of my team to develop this mobile payment app !!

    The Impact This mobile payment app for grocery shopping will affect just about EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. The majority of us go to the grocery store for food and other items, and the majority of us wait in lines even if we only have 5-10 items to check in. Let's streamline the grocery shopping process by developing scan-as-you-go technology that will put the power of shopping in the consumer's hands that will allow them to save money, time, and headaches. Furthermore, let's put an end to cutting out coupons out of the grocery store's weekly newspaper by automating the process. Why do the manual work that requires more time and effort when you can just sign up for sale alerts and promotions going on based on your location and your shopping history?

    Risks & Challenges  
The primary risk with completing this project is that I will be learning (a lot) on the go. I am not new to putting all of my time and energy into an effort that I knew could be a game-changer, but yes, I am new to the actual development of an app from scratch. However, I am extremely confident that with a little bit of time and connecting, I can create a winning formula. I've been a part of one before, see below link for when my team won first place at a social innovation design competition in college (2011 - Clean2O):

   Other Ways You Can Assist
Spread the word to your friends and family whether it be in person or on social media. Hell, tell it to the random guy sitting next to you on the train or in the bar. A revolution is coming...the long lines and waits in the grocery store are coming to an end...savings in time and money both for the consumer and the business owner are on the horizon...and that person who cancels a purchase in front of you because he/she thought it was on sale but it really wasn't? That will no longer be a thing.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi!  We are a team of family &amp; friends from Auckland, New Zealand with a serious passion for plastics.</p>
<p>We created the Clever Card to enable people to create, fix, craft, prototype &amp; customise utilizing mouldbale plastic &amp; rubber which melts in hot water and is reusable hundreds of times. It is non-toxic (kid friendly) and comes in loads of different colours.</p>
<p>The cards are made from a special bio-polymer that has the ability to melt at only 62 degrees C (about the same as a nice hot choclate).</p>
<p>When in a solid state is is as hard as nylon.  When it is heated it is safe to touch with your hands and feels like Plasticine.  When it cools it returns to its original strength and hardness.</p>
<p>Our campaign and your support will enable us to produce our next project, a Classroom Education Pack, which includes lesson plans and clever cards to teach the next generation about the Science, Processing, Application and Recycling of plastics.</p>

For make that all people knows more about this project please share it on facebook or any other social network , and let's start sprade the MagCharge all over the world !No more scartching...How it works ? This cable is composed by two parts , the first is the plug that will be plugged in to your iPhone , the second is the cable that will lay on your desk ... The only thing that you will need to do to charge your iPhone is to take it closer to the cable , and it will automatically plug in... You will be able to buy the two cable parts separately , just in case you need two plugs for your iPhone and iPad , but you want to use the same cable , or If you want to have a spare one ... After you will insert the plug into your iPhone you just have to leave it there and forget about it , so you won't scratch the bottom of your iPhone every time you need to charge it ...   Stop dropping your phone while is charging !  You can consider the magnetic plug as a safety feature , if you are using your iPhone while is charging and someone steps on the cable , you won't drop your phone , but the cable will automatically unplug ...   While you're driving you shouldn't have any distractions !  Or while your are driving and you can't focus on finding the cable and plug it , but just take the iPhone closer to your cable ,and your done ! No magnetic induction = No delay ! The cable will be available in different length in case you consider the standard size cable too short ... One of my goals is to keep the cable affordable so everyone can have the MagCharge ... The cable doesn't work with magnetic induction , but with two pins that will fiscally touch so you won't have any charging delay , just like a normal cable ... I'm already keeping in touch with a company that will help me with my project , but for make it happens I need your help , thank you for your time , and obviously thank you for your support *The cable works with all apple devices that uses lightning cable.Here all the compatibily products : 
Status of the project & next stepsAfter have tried different products and tested the prototipes , and solved a difficult problem about the magnetic connection and power of the single magnet , I prepare a business plan and I've got in tuoch with different companies for the materials and for start the production , but for make it happen I need your help , here a small business plan on how I will use the funds rased :

<p></p>
<p><span>As we mentioned, uploading and bandwidth are free to all users, including the Free Account. That is what Youtube does, isn´t it? </span></p>
<p><span>But almost all the benefits you may have from this innovation are limited without the synchronised transcript. At the moment it is a technology in construction and it comes with a cost. Basically, subscribing to one of our paid plans means paying for the transcription service at a very good price: €5/hour. All extra features are a Bonus. </span></p>

<h2><span>Features</span></h2>
<h3>SEO Audio Transcription</h3>
<p>Yes, it’s true. The audio content creators are struggling to promote their work and they don’t count on good allies, as other media formats, like Google Search. There ----is---- was no way that Google could index your audios. Up to now.. I’ll tell you how: Upload your audio to Smab, ask for the transcript and you’ll have it in a matter of minutes. When returned, the text transcription is already aligned with your audio and interactive. Now, Google knows all the words that were mentioned in your audio. Now it has more chances to be discovered. </p>
<h3>Visual layer sync</h3>
<p>The ability to upload and synchronise visual content like images, charts, code blocks, math formulas, links, notes, videos and more gives birth to a visual layer aligned with the audio.</p>
<p></p>
<br/>
<br/><h3>In-track search and browsing</h3>
<p>Have you ever rewound your cassette tapes using a pen? Browsing a digital audio track is now faster, but it has the level of accuracy of a pen: none! At Smab, your audio gets chunked in sentences so the navigation can be done accurately. We know the time frame of each spoken word in the audio and we don’t keep it secret. Now, listeners can make word searches inside the audio. How cool is that?!</p>
<img alt=""Podcast, Smab, Audiobooks, Audio, SEO, eLeaning, Podcasting, Podcaster, Media Hosting, MP3"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i64.tinypic.com/anl9ts.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<br/><h3>Widget player, social sharing and the audio virality</h3>
<p>An embeddable iframe that is generated by Smab, It offers a similar experience to the original Smab player. You can add it to your blog, playing an audio track and displaying the visual items that were previously synced. It also benefits from the precise navigation system. This is what we call a beautiful packaging. Combined with the ability to share snippets of audio through the social networks, we hope we can make audio go viral.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Monetisation</h3>
<p>We believe so much in our new way of monetizing the audio that we offer the possibility to share the income from the visual ads with the authors. Upload your audios and enhance them with quality visual items related to the audio content. We will attach visual banners and share the benefits with you.</p>
<p>By using the visual layer synchronisation, it’s easier to turn listeners into buyers. You just have to sync the URL of the product you have mentioned. In other words: we have put the Call-To-Action button inside the audio! Your Sponsor will boost your paycheck! </p>
<br/><h3>eCommerce feature</h3>
<p>You are right; nobody wants to pay for listening to a podcast. But they will pay for listening to an audiobook or a specialised course. With this feature you can set your own price for individual audio tracks. You can offer the first two chapters for free and start selling from the third one onwards. Self-publish your books with Smab (Compatible with the visual ads revenue model)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448487820/m2ocbkx5mkj2w5opdftw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h3>Advanced privacy</h3>
<p>You get to choose different privacy levels for your audios. Not everything has to be public. You can decide whether to share it only with your followers or with a closed group of students who have the URL to the track/list.</p>
<br/><h3>Scheduled publishing</h3>
<p>We know that on a regular basis you finish the editing past midnight. So it may be a bad idea to publish and tweet the event at that time, since all your audience are offline. You can have it uploaded and scheduled to be published first thing in the morning. And you can have a lie-in.</p>
<div><br/></div>
<br/><h3>Multiple authors show</h3>
<p>Fortunately, podcasting is not a one-man show. We offer you the possibility to have  managing privileges for one show from different accounts.</p>

<h2><span>Equipo</span></h2>
<p>SMAB is the perfect mix of a dream, a good moment of inspiration, and a job well done. What started as the adventure of its creator, Adrian Dogar, has become a community where talent, enthusiasm, and creativity join their forces. SMAB’s team is diverse, rich, and shares a clear goal.</p>
<p>We want to help knowledge to be available to more and more people every day, in an easy, accessible way. As a matter of fact, providing young students with a useful, functional tool to learn was one of reasons behind the birth of the platform.</p>
<p><a href=""http://smab.audio/en/about-us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://smab.audio/en/about-us/</a></p>
<h2>The Story Behind Smab</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>SMAB was born out of a fascinating story, and an inspiration emerged from education related problems - the founder, Adrian Dogar has studied and left unfinished two university degrees. He drew the product’s first sketches on the plasterboard walls that he was building as a labourer. The financial crisis which hit hard Spain’s economy these last years also hit Dogar’s trajectory, making him take the decision of recycling itself by going back to study, while still working.</p>
<p>It was during this period of working and studying again when the idea of SMAB was born. Dogar enrolled in two programming courses, but noticed he wasn’t advancing as fast as he wanted. “I didn’t had enough time. I worked many hours during the day, and I have two daughters at home,” explains Adrian Dogar, CEO of SMAB. He decided to <b>convert his courses textbooks, into audio tracks</b>, <b>so that he could listen to and study while installing drywall </b>during his working day.</p>
<p>His experience was bittersweet. Using audio with an educational purpose proved to be a really good idea. Dogar finished his courses with the highest scores. However, the experience of listening to the audio was far from perfect. He needed a precise way to navigate into the audio and wanted to<b> see the examples</b> on screen while they where explained. </p>
<p>Determined to share with others what had worked so well for him, and to solve the problems of the system he had used, he started to look into existent technology and to develop his first app. These were the first steps of <b>SMAB, a platform to share and consume audio.</b></p>
<p>During the last years, Dogar has worked to make his idea and dream true. As a matter of fact, SMAB was one of the finalist projects selected for <b>Yuzz’s 4th edition, one of Spain’s most renowned entrepreneur programmes</b>. Thanks to this, SMAB could travel to Silicon Valley and experience first hand how the startup ecosystem works there.</p>

3. Corporate

Companies have one pack that lets them reserve 20 usernames and a second one where we include all our study data revealed every 6 months during the first two years of our project. This data cover usage and engagement statistics for both authors and audience regarding our innovation: synced images and links, SEO transcript performance, visual ads, internal word search, snippets sharing on social networks, interactive audio player widget, and much more.

If uploading and bandwidth are unlimited and free, what are the paid accounts for?


As we mentioned, uploading and bandwidth are free to all users, including the Free Account. That is what Youtube does, isn´t it? 
But almost all the benefits you may have from this innovation are limited without the synchronised transcript. At the moment it is a technology in construction and it comes with a cost. Basically, subscribing to one of our paid plans means paying for the transcription service at a very good price: €5/hour. All extra features are a Bonus. 



Features
SEO Audio Transcription
Yes, it’s true. The audio content creators are struggling to promote their work and they don’t count on good allies, as other media formats, like Google Search. There ----is---- was no way that Google could index your audios. Up to now.. I’ll tell you how: Upload your audio to Smab, ask for the transcript and you’ll have it in a matter of minutes. When returned, the text transcription is already aligned with your audio and interactive. Now, Google knows all the words that were mentioned in your audio. Now it has more chances to be discovered. 
Visual layer sync
The ability to upload and synchronise visual content like images, charts, code blocks, math formulas, links, notes, videos and more gives birth to a visual layer aligned with the audio.


In-track search and browsing
Have you ever rewound your cassette tapes using a pen? Browsing a digital audio track is now faster, but it has the level of accuracy of a pen: none! At Smab, your audio gets chunked in sentences so the navigation can be done accurately. We know the time frame of each spoken word in the audio and we don’t keep it secret. Now, listeners can make word searches inside the audio. How cool is that?!

Widget player, social sharing and the audio virality
An embeddable iframe that is generated by Smab, It offers a similar experience to the original Smab player. You can add it to your blog, playing an audio track and displaying the visual items that were previously synced. It also benefits from the precise navigation system. This is what we call a beautiful packaging. Combined with the ability to share snippets of audio through the social networks, we hope we can make audio go viral.

Monetisation
We believe so much in our new way of monetizing the audio that we offer the possibility to share the income from the visual ads with the authors. Upload your audios and enhance them with quality visual items related to the audio content. We will attach visual banners and share the benefits with you.
By using the visual layer synchronisation, it’s easier to turn listeners into buyers. You just have to sync the URL of the product you have mentioned. In other words: we have put the Call-To-Action button inside the audio! Your Sponsor will boost your paycheck! 
eCommerce feature
You are right; nobody wants to pay for listening to a podcast. But they will pay for listening to an audiobook or a specialised course. With this feature you can set your own price for individual audio tracks. You can offer the first two chapters for free and start selling from the third one onwards. Self-publish your books with Smab (Compatible with the visual ads revenue model)

Advanced privacy
You get to choose different privacy levels for your audios. Not everything has to be public. You can decide whether to share it only with your followers or with a closed group of students who have the URL to the track/list.
Scheduled publishing
We know that on a regular basis you finish the editing past midnight. So it may be a bad idea to publish and tweet the event at that time, since all your audience are offline. You can have it uploaded and scheduled to be published first thing in the morning. And you can have a lie-in.

Multiple authors show
Fortunately, podcasting is not a one-man show. We offer you the possibility to have  managing privileges for one show from different accounts.

Equipo
SMAB is the perfect mix of a dream, a good moment of inspiration, and a job well done. What started as the adventure of its creator, Adrian Dogar, has become a community where talent, enthusiasm, and creativity join their forces. SMAB’s team is diverse, rich, and shares a clear goal.
We want to help knowledge to be available to more and more people every day, in an easy, accessible way. As a matter of fact, providing young students with a useful, functional tool to learn was one of reasons behind the birth of the platform.

The Story Behind Smab



SMAB was born out of a fascinating story, and an inspiration emerged from education related problems - the founder, Adrian Dogar has studied and left unfinished two university degrees. He drew the product’s first sketches on the plasterboard walls that he was building as a labourer. The financial crisis which hit hard Spain’s economy these last years also hit Dogar’s trajectory, making him take the decision of recycling itself by going back to study, while still working.
It was during this period of working and studying again when the idea of SMAB was born. Dogar enrolled in two programming courses, but noticed he wasn’t advancing as fast as he wanted. “I didn’t had enough time. I worked many hours during the day, and I have two daughters at home,” explains Adrian Dogar, CEO of SMAB. He decided to convert his courses textbooks, into audio tracks, so that he could listen to and study while installing drywall during his working day.
His experience was bittersweet. Using audio with an educational purpose proved to be a really good idea. Dogar finished his courses with the highest scores. However, the experience of listening to the audio was far from perfect. He needed a precise way to navigate into the audio and wanted to see the examples on screen while they where explained. 
Determined to share with others what had worked so well for him, and to solve the problems of the system he had used, he started to look into existent technology and to develop his first app. These were the first steps of SMAB, a platform to share and consume audio.
During the last years, Dogar has worked to make his idea and dream true. As a matter of fact, SMAB was one of the finalist projects selected for Yuzz’s 4th edition, one of Spain’s most renowned entrepreneur programmes. Thanks to this, SMAB could travel to Silicon Valley and experience first hand how the startup ecosystem works there.

Design Process
When we first thought about the idea, we tested it using a rubber band,just to make sure the cables will not tangle when connecting all the ends together.
Then we drew some sketches to see how it will look like.


Then we move to Illustrations - to see how the product will look like.

                       

For our prototype, we printed our model using a 3D printer,and after a few weeks  (maybe more than few...) we got the perfect model.
Before mass production we verified that the sizes are right.
Neon Green !


Awesome Cyan !
     

     
Classic Gray !





                                                                                      Closure 101 - How to useUsing Closure is simple and easy - it takes only 3 stepsto set up your earphones to be tangled free 
The 3 basic steps: 1. Connect the Closure using the two slots.2. Slide it up - there is no problem if you are having a     microphone in the middle, just unplug the cable from one     of the slots and connect it again right after the microphone connector.3. Insert both of the earphones into the socket, then plug the  audio plug into its socket and now your earphones are ready to store!



Special Features:
You probably noticed that there's a white plastic cover on each of our closures,This plastic can be used in several ways:1. Draw a nice painting and show it to your friends. 2. Stick a sticker or a funny meme you like.3. For company use, you can add your company logo.

About us: 
We are 25 years old entrepreneurs, we know each other since highschool. In these days we are both working in high tech companies.We love to think about new ideas that could help other people.Our dream is to quit our jobs and start a business of our own.
                                                                                       Risks and Challenges: Like every project, we had challenges during the design process,first we printed it using a 3D printer, just to see if it willfit to the earphones cables, we repeated this process severaltimes until we got a good prototype. Then we moved to a rubber prototype,at first we got a model that was too elastic so the earphones cables justslipped from it, after several tests we increased the rubber strengthand got a model that can keep the cables in the right position.
Warning: Not for children under 3 yrs - small partsThank you so much for checking out our project!!! 
And Remember, Closure is for everyone ! :)",30.0,0,"3 Campaigns

</div><p>Hi Everyone, </p>
<p>Are you sick of mobile phones
ringing when your out and about, esp at places that <b>deserve peace and quiet?</b>
Like the Cinema, Library, Meeting rooms or Places of Worship? Well I'am. So I
came up with this idea when I went away on a spiritual journey to India around
three years ago. </p>
<p>I remember leaving on of the many crazy
bizarre's of New Delhi, hot sticky sun,  and entering a secluded building. It was very quiet and chilled out. Everyone was just worshiping God peacefully.
Then all of a sudden a phone starts to RING LOOOUUUD! It was some irritating and catchy
song I cant remember. So I thought to myself, how can I stop these phones from
disturbing people?  Or at least control/minimise noise in an area. I
thought by getting away from busy Melbourne life I'd finally find some quiet
time. </p>
<p>So when I got back to Australia, I
thought hard and I came up with<b><i> Hush Hush</i></b>.</p>
<p>The App/Service:</p>
<p>Hush Hush is an app/service that
will assist to silence Android and Apple mobile phones when users enter a Hush
Zone. The app is free for Users to download. The service is purchased by our
Clients that may need phones silenced at their Business Centers. As I mentioned
earlier, business centers such as Cinema’s, Universities, Private Corporations
(corporate meeting rooms), or Public Facilities such as Libraries and Places of
Worship (Mosques/Church/Synagogue's). The device is a global product and not
restricted to a certain country.</p>
<p>Technicality:</p>
<p>This app works alongside external
hardware devices such as a Router/Modem. The Hush Radar is installed and
activated on the Clients new or existing router/modem. Once the Hush Hush app
is downloaded onto a users Android or Apple phone, the Hush Radar will scan a
set range to detect any phones with the Hush Hush app installed (FREE to
download on the Android Market or App Store). If detected, the app will
automatically switch the Users phones to silent mode. Once the User leaves the
Hush Zone, the app will automatically set their phones back to their original
settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Budget:</span></p>
<p>The initial costs for developing
the device is $33,000. This will cover the following...</p><p></p><ul>

Power detect when you want to punch, hook or dodge, but it can also detect how

gyroscope, it also senses the orientation and rotation motion of your forearm. Furthermore,
Gadia Power uses BT4.0 to transmit all data to the smart control device to
recognize different hand gestures. Due to the complexity of EMG signals, we
developed a machine learning algorithm to map them to recognizable gestures. As
the projects progresses, we will continue to train the algorithm in order to
increase its accuracy. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437992215/dkdzhmsu0yfpybqjocsv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437992276/gfuxa1e5vfcqblmg5hr5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2></h2><p></p><p></p><p>Gadia

Power is a coin-sized gesture control wearable that sits on your forearm capturing electromyography
(EMG) signal. It can translate your natural hand gesture into readable information to
communicate with your electronic gadgets.Gaming:
 Gadia Power provides a hand-free control
system, enabling you to game with natural hand gestures. You can use it to play
all kinds of fun games! To make things even cooler, we are currently trying to
develop a boxing game using Gadia Power as the gaming console. That’s right! The
first ever muscle sensor video game! To play the game, you will need two Gadia
Power units attached to both your left and right forearms. Not only can Gadia
Power detect when you want to punch, hook or dodge, but it can also detect how
hard you actually swing by using EMG and accelerometer and reflection by DC. We believe the game experience
should not be limited to visual and sound experience it should be more real as
technology evolves. In the future, we intend to  add more fun and realness into your gaming
experience. Outdoor
Control: Gadia Labs believes Gaida Power can be your coolest pal, assisting you
in almost any situation. It can control your music when you are working out, capture
fun moments with your GoPro when you are skiing, or pick up your phone call
when you are climbing.Fitness:
Gadia Power can also act as your personal trainer. It can detect your biometrics
while working out and provide feasible training advice. Information on muscle
activity, fatigue, cardio, hydration, balance can help you optimize your
workout and reduce your chances of getting injured due to over-exercise.In
the future, Gadia Lab intends to make major breakthroughs in certain crucial
areas. The first one is to allow Gadia Power to work with VR devices. Gadia Labs
thinks it just isn’t right to use a gamepad to interact with your Oculus Rift
or other VR devices any more the controlling device should match the level of
stunning sense of presence. Secondly, Gaida Labs believes EMG technology should
not be limited to gesture control; in fact, it could be used in the gaming
system to bring a greater level of reality into our gaming experience. Bio-sensing
knowledge like muscle-sensing can detect deeper dimensions of experience,
bringing a more immersive gaming experience.We at Gadia Power believes
developing a loving community is crucial to our future. To that end, an open
source framework will be designed to help developers create their own immersive
experience and share it on our community. In addition, we will open raw EMG to
every developer to customize gestures.  We

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>I WANT My Portrait Sculpture – What should I do?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Reserve any of the offers or perks mentioned in the campaign. Download MyPortraitSculpture App, take the video of the person you want to get the sculpture done and upload it. Contact us for providing the mailing address and to find out approximate delivery time.</p>
<p><b>What would be the price of the sculpture if I order after the campaigning is done?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The price after the campaign would be vary according to the perks and the material you order. The price would definitely not be the same and it would vary depending on the material chosen.</p>
<p><b>How soon can I get the sculpture to my address?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We can complete the sculptures mostly in a month once we start them. However, we may have number of projects lined up that comes before your piece. We shall provide the estimated date of completion once you make the first payment.</p>
<p><b>Can I order multiple pieces of the same sculpture?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes, you can order multiple pieces of the same sculpture, however the price will not be the same as the original one. For further details, you may contact us on + 1 323 332 0941 </p>
<p><b>Can I order any other sculpture other than Portraits?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As a kickstart, we are taking orders of the portrait sculptures only. In future, we may extend the services to sculptures other than portraits.</p>
<p><b>Will MyPortraitSculpture App work with Android, Blackberry, Windows? When will my platform be supported?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are designing MyPortraitSculpture App so that it will work with any web enabled device, with extra features to enhance the experience in our native app. Prior to launch, we are developing for iOS and Android. MyPortraitSculpture App will also be accessible through a mobile-friendly and tablet-friendly web app which can be accessed on any web-enabled device.</p>
<p><b>What are the challenges?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are doing something that has never been done before: a completely revolutionary sculpting service like nothing else in the market. While there may be manufacturing and production delays outside of our control, we promise timely and transparent communication throughout the process. Soon, MyPortraitSculpture app and it's service will be available and connecting people to their generations and their families like never before.</p>
<p><b>What if I have spectacles?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you have spectacles, best features may be inculcated in the sculpture if the video is taken twice, once with the spectacles and once without the spectacles.</p>
<p><b>What are the precautions I should take while taking video for the sculpture?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The video should be taken very carefully without missing any of the angles. Sculpture is to be preserved for years together and may be forever. So expression is very important while taking the video, which would be inculcated in the sculpture. It is logical to think that a happy person is represented with a smiling portrait. But a person cannot be seen smiling forever. The value of smile is that it is not always present. One should put their own expression instead of forcing themselves to give a smile while taking video. Any forced expression like smile becomes old and boring. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Generally, if the posture is relaxed and restrained and sustainable, the sculpture will be more elegant and look natural. Action pose might be appropriate if the intention of the sculpture is to express a specific occasion.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is understood that a large mass of hair can not be represented artfully. Hair styles change with age and personality does not. So if women wear their hair in a classic pony tail or in a fashionable pulled up style, even with advancing age, a person is uniquely identifiable and still retains the same inner beauty.</p>
<p><b>Why are the sculptures so cheaper when compared to other artists in the world?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As mentioned in the text, only detailing is done by the master sculptors and hence does not involve much of manual work when compared to regular sculpture making.</p>
<p><b>Can you make smaller sculptures so that it comes to a cheaper price?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Best prices are set for the sizes mentioned to give you the best detailing of the sculptures. Smaller sculpture does not come for a cheaper price as it takes the same efforts and time as it takes for the large size sculpture.</p>
<p><b>Is it possible to get the sculpture if I want it to be delivered on a particular date?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We do not take rush orders and put the other projects aside. This will effect the quality of work. If you want the sculpture on a particular date, please make sure you order at least four months in advance.</p>
<p><b>Can you make sculptures for posthumous considerations?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sculpting a posthumous portrait from a collection of videos is extremely challenging and should only be attempted by an artist who has extensively experience in live portraiture.</p>
<p><b>How do I preserve the sculptures?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To clean pollen or dust off a sculpture, spray a glass cleaner and wipe it with a soft cloth.</p>

It is understood that a large mass of hair can not be represented artfully. Hair styles change with age and personality does not. So if women wear their hair in a classic pony tail or in a fashionable pulled up style, even with advancing age, a person is uniquely identifiable and still retains the same inner beauty.
Why are the sculptures so cheaper when compared to other artists in the world?
As mentioned in the text, only detailing is done by the master sculptors and hence does not involve much of manual work when compared to regular sculpture making.
Can you make smaller sculptures so that it comes to a cheaper price?
Best prices are set for the sizes mentioned to give you the best detailing of the sculptures. Smaller sculpture does not come for a cheaper price as it takes the same efforts and time as it takes for the large size sculpture.
Is it possible to get the sculpture if I want it to be delivered on a particular date?
We do not take rush orders and put the other projects aside. This will effect the quality of work. If you want the sculpture on a particular date, please make sure you order at least four months in advance.
Can you make sculptures for posthumous considerations?
Sculpting a posthumous portrait from a collection of videos is extremely challenging and should only be attempted by an artist who has extensively experience in live portraiture.
How do I preserve the sculptures?
To clean pollen or dust off a sculpture, spray a glass cleaner and wipe it with a soft cloth.

However, smarthome scenarios are limited to expert hobbyists or to those who can afford expensive commercial solutions. The closed nature of such systems means that they cannot extend from the end-user and cannot control from a centralized point. Jubito aims to bridge this gap by presenting users with a server-like abstraction for technology in the home. It enables cross-device tasks via customized Instruction Sets [4] written against the framework, and gives users a management interface designed for the home environment.<br/><br/><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br/>Assistive domotics is a field where home automation allows people to stay comfortable at home but can also offer possibilities such as increased safety (access control, intrusion detection), robotics, etc. Moreover home automation is becoming a viable option for the elderly and disabled who would prefer to stay in the comfort of their homes rather than move to a healthcare facility. This field uses much of the same technology and equipment as home automation for security, entertainment, and energy conservation but tailors it towards the elderly and disabled [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation_for_the_elderly_and_disabled"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wiki</a>].<br/>jaNET Framework [2] provides multiple functions and APIs that Jubito can use in order to interact with multiple vendor hardware (especially open hardware, e.g. Arduino). It is designed to be absolutely vendor-neutral as well as hardware/protocol-agnostic and can run on any device that is capable of running .NET Framework or mono-runtime [5] (Linux, Windows, Mac). Using Jubito one can take control of its system via a mobile phone, tablet, laptop or anything can connect to the internet/intranet. The use of Jubito is to provide an intuitive user interface for control and manage an abundance of different technologies via a centralized system. The advantage of the tool lies in their ease of use and the usability that is offered by its ecosystem, so that anyone can very quickly set up his controlled environment. No extra programming is required, but someone with that skill can easily adapt its own modules.<br/><br/><b>MY PERSPECTIVE</b><br/>When I first started working on this project and had its concept in my mind back in 2010, I had no idea what the Internet of Things (IoT) was. Actually, I'm not even sure if it was defined.

Jubito [3] is an intuitive user interface that can be used with or without a microcontroller (such as Arduino) and both can be used to link different objects regardless technology and manage them from a central point (like a mobile device).Moreover I offer these tools free of charge to the developer’s community. I have set up a github as well as a code contribution channel [2] for developers.The primary domain of use at the moment is the AAL environment or Assistive Domotics but this does not mean that Jubito cannot be easily adopted by other domains such as health, industrial automation, where speed and ease of use is essential.This campaign will give me the opportunity to get involved with 
technologies which I'm not familiar and hopefully help me improve my 
expertise in order to develop a single solution for home automation in 
the era of the Internet of Things.WHAT I NEED & WHAT YOU GETThis is my first attempt for crowdfunding and a first step towards my aim. This means that this is not the endpoint of my goals.The objective is to integrate protocols like z-wave for start and then do research to obtain knowhow for the development of a breakthrough product in extremely low cost that will use the available infrastructure for building a smart home.Achieving that, requires human resources, more than just myself.THE IMPACTJubito has earned its acknowledgement after all this time. The most important award received was the globally recognized ""Internet of Things"" Award 2014-15 of postscapes.com and the second one was the hackaday prize. That triggered the collaborative spirit and it is a fine example of what can be accomplished by synergies.RISKS & CHALLENGESSo far it is a risk-free project that is just consuming my spare time and some of my income. However I believe that I can move to the next level with a little bit of your belief.OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPDo you like the idea? Be social and spread Jubito by adding a reference to your website, facebook, twitter, google+, etc and don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!Alternatively, consider donating! Funding a project is always a good way for maintenance and further development.

<p>The Blue Lock advances technology invented in <b>1967!</b> The child-resistant locking closure for containers was invented in 1967 by Dr. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Breault"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Henri Breault</a>. Isn't it time for a change? Current technology was invented decades before most of you were born!<br/></p>
<p>Child-resistant bottles only work for the youngest kids and are known to be a problem for some aged individuals or people with disabilities. Not to mention pets! The Blue Lock updates this 49 year old technology by applying a Bluetooth enabled lid on a hard impact polycarbonate box. <br/></p>
<p>The Blue Lock provides responsible drug users an affordable and simple to use box to provide an extra layer of security to their stash of drugs. Using your cell phone, IPad or other Bluetooth device you can lock and unlock your personal stuff. <br/></p>

<br/><h1><b>The Free Blue Lock App</b></h1>
<p>Use the simple Blue Lock App to Lock and Unlock your Blue Lock Box. The Blue Lock app is free and easy to use. You can also use the app's unique monitor system to know when and by whom the box has been opened. <br/></p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
Timer: The Blue Lock can be set to only open at specific times or
 intervals (i.e., every 4 hours). This is very important for 
prescription drugs. (Sometimes painkillers can make you forget when you 
took them last.)</li>
<li>
Audit Trails: If you want to know when and who last opened the Blue Lock, you can turn on the audit trail feature.</li>
<li>
People: You can add and remove different people from having access to your Blue Lock.</li>
<li>
Battery Strength: You can always monitor the power remaining in the battery.</li>
<li>
Boxes: You can identify multiple Blue Locks and lock/unlock each 
independently. (You can have a Blue Lock for Percocet and one for 
OxyContin. You could also have a Blue Box for gummy bears and a 
different box for chocolates.)</li>

<br/><h1><b>Who Should Use The Blue Lock?</b></h1>
<p>Everyone with medications, prescription drugs, recreational drugs (especially edibles). Unless you live in a cave and never ever have visitors you need The Blue Lock. Think about it - if your best friends come over and raid your stash you could be liable for their actions. What if their 5 year old finds a MMJ gummy bear someone dropped at your last party? <br/></p>
<p>Don't wait until an accident happens - be responsible and put your stash in The Blue Lock!<br/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have kids, protect them from your drugs with The Blue Lock!</p>

<h3><b>Case Studies</b></h3>
<blockquote><p>""A friend is on a lot of painkillers. His body is pretty beat up from motorcycle accidents and working a very physical job. He frequently wakes in the middle of the night wondering when the last time he took his painkillers. In a stupor from the painkillers he isn't always thinking clearly. And the first thought is ""I  better take more pills before the pain gets worse."" It may have only been 1 hour since he last took his pills.""</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Solution: The Blue Box -</b> my friend will have to use his phone to open the Blue Lock box and the app can be programmed to only open based on the prescription.</p>
<blockquote><p>""My dog ate my marijuana edibles and I spent over $1,000 at the vet to have his stomach pumped!!""</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Solution: The Blue Box -</b> Pets are generally smaller than their owners and can't handle the same dose as adult humans. Its not impossible, but it would be very hard for a pet to eat through the Blue Lock.</p>
<blockquote><p>""My parents (or grandparents) have terrible arthritis and have a difficult time opening child-resistant pill bottles.""</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Solution: The Blue Box -</b> Empty the contents of the child-resistant pill bottles into The Blue Lock. You can even program the app to remind them when to take their pills.</p>

<p>We use our smartphones all the time, but when our batteries get low, there's one thing that really annoys us, and that's charger. Regular charging cables haven't changed all that much and they can be a pain to plug in. That's why we created Magni Cable. We were tired of the boring old charging cables. We wanted something that would work to make your life simpler. Using magnets and smart design Magni Cable can do some amazing things. No more disappointing micro USB cables. <b>We know you will love Magni Cable! </b></p>

<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>August 2017 to August 2018 prototyping and testing </p>
<p>September 2018 to November 2018 crowd-funding campaign</p>
<p>November 2018 to January 2019 manufacturing </p>
<p>January 2019 to February/March 2019 shpping to our US and EU warehouses</p>
<p>March 2019 shipping</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks and Challanges</h3>
<p>The PHONESLINGER is an already ready-to-production product and will be manufactured as soon as the campaign is successfully completed. The production-ready-prototypes aretested by many smartphone photographers and do work without any problem. As COSYSPEED has already several products in production, and we already successfuly funded two campaigns on Indiegogo. we can access an already well working chain of high quality manufacturing, shipment and distribution. </p>
<p>Our manufacturer (certified by SGS) is located in the Chinese Shenzen area and run by a German manufacturing company. It is guaranteed that quality is on a very high standard and that all workers are working under very good and proven conditions. Furthermore the SGS certification ensures environmentaly friendly manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>With two successful Indiegogo campaigns in the back there are in our opinion no real risks. Only serious circumstances are a risk, such as natural desasters for example.  </p>
<p>The main challenge is to make this campaign a success. And with your help and recommandations it is realistic that we can master this amazing project :-)</p>
<p> </p>

Risks and Challanges
The PHONESLINGER is an already ready-to-production product and will be manufactured as soon as the campaign is successfully completed. The production-ready-prototypes aretested by many smartphone photographers and do work without any problem. As COSYSPEED has already several products in production, and we already successfuly funded two campaigns on Indiegogo. we can access an already well working chain of high quality manufacturing, shipment and distribution. 
Our manufacturer (certified by SGS) is located in the Chinese Shenzen area and run by a German manufacturing company. It is guaranteed that quality is on a very high standard and that all workers are working under very good and proven conditions. Furthermore the SGS certification ensures environmentaly friendly manufacturing processes.
With two successful Indiegogo campaigns in the back there are in our opinion no real risks. Only serious circumstances are a risk, such as natural desasters for example.  
The main challenge is to make this campaign a success. And with your help and recommandations it is realistic that we can master this amazing project :-)
 
Team & Thanks :-)
Thomas Ludwig, CEO and founder of COSYSPEED
Thomas Ludwig has had an advertising agency in Germany for almost 20 years and was working as development aid worker for the German Development Service in African countries. He is a photo nerd since many years and has a passion for street photography (but not much time for it). He lives with his family in Bonn/Germany.
Stefan Eggers, Social Media Manager at COSYSPEED
Stefan has a wide variety of skills and is a nerdy guy who is using Moment Lenses with great passion. It was Stefans inspiration that lead to the PHONESLINGER Prime. Stefan is a Brand Ambassador to Moment Lenses and lives in Bonn/Germany.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The world is changing at a very fast pace and millions of us are now surrounded by digital devices and smart technology, spending hours upon hours on them each and every day. In fact, you could say we are hooked. With the constant viewing of digital screens, a new danger is brought to our eyes - from work to home and on the move, we use our devices of convenience for huge numbers of hours every day, and this is taking its toll on our eyes.</span><br/></p>

<h3>What is the effect from UV and Blue light on our eyes?</h3>
<p>All digital devices emit UV and artificial blue light.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet rays (UV) attack the cornea every day and the crystalline lens of the eye. The cumulative effect over time can potentially contribute to cataracts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, blue-violet light penetrates a lot further into the eyes and reaches the retina. These two specific wavelengths have recently been identified as being harmful to retinal cells – in fact, blue-violet light is involved in their gradual degeneration. This is one of the proven causes of AMD (age macular degeneration) which is thought to be a cause of blindness, so protecting your eyes from these wavelengths and children's eyes is vitally important.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433669475/d2xoszwhvbgb3lwn8pts.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Zappi’s computer and gaming eyewear protects you from these two specific wavelengths with our Wavelength Lens TechnologyTM filtering out the artificial blue light and have UV 400 protection. Our computer glasses are non prescription and are designed for people who do not normally wear glasses but view digital screens often, which is almost everyone.</p>
<p>We are essentially rebuffing this radiation and bringing fashion forward to stylish computer and gaming glasses for adults and children. We have thought of every member of the family.</p>

<h4>What makes our glasses lenses special compared to other lenses ?</h4>
<p></p>
<p>We have spent almost one and half years working with our supplier, taking many samples and prototypes to create our computer glasses lenses with the correct coatings, which reduce radiation and filter out the harmful blue light along with offering UV 400 protection. They reduce digital eye strain and visual demands.</p>

<h4>Are Zappi glasses available with a prescription ?</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately we do not currently offer a prescription version of the Zappi computer glasses. However, this is something we wish to provide in the near future. Therefore, we made the clip-on version for everyone who already wears prescription glasses - they fit straight on to your prescription eyewear, giving you all the benefits of the computer glasses by cutting out the blue light. The clip-ons are a melanin lens and reduce blue light by approximately 50%.</p>
<h4>What is the difference between the two lenses?</h4>
<div>
<p>Our two lenses have the same protective coatings on. The clearer-looking lens with a slight tint lets more true light through and reduces the blue light by approximately 30%, whilst the more yellow lens filters out the blue light by over 50%. They both add more contrast and reduce the visual demands on your eyes, allowing them to relax. </p>
<p></p>
<h4>Are Zappi Computer glasses available in other styles and colors ?</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Our glasses are currently only available in the models and colors on Indiegogo, but we will look to bring a new range and colors out in the future. </p>
<h4>How will you know which Zappi glasses i have ordered ?</h4>
<p></p>
<p>We will ask you after the Indiegogo campaign is closed to get your exact frame style color and lens choices. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

The world is changing at a very fast pace and millions of us are now surrounded by digital devices and smart technology, spending hours upon hours on them each and every day. In fact, you could say we are hooked. With the constant viewing of digital screens, a new danger is brought to our eyes - from work to home and on the move, we use our devices of convenience for huge numbers of hours every day, and this is taking its toll on our eyes.




         



What is the effect from UV and Blue light on our eyes?
All digital devices emit UV and artificial blue light.
Ultraviolet rays (UV) attack the cornea every day and the crystalline lens of the eye. The cumulative effect over time can potentially contribute to cataracts.
Meanwhile, blue-violet light penetrates a lot further into the eyes and reaches the retina. These two specific wavelengths have recently been identified as being harmful to retinal cells – in fact, blue-violet light is involved in their gradual degeneration. This is one of the proven causes of AMD (age macular degeneration) which is thought to be a cause of blindness, so protecting your eyes from these wavelengths and children's eyes is vitally important.

Zappi’s computer and gaming eyewear protects you from these two specific wavelengths with our Wavelength Lens TechnologyTM filtering out the artificial blue light and have UV 400 protection. Our computer glasses are non prescription and are designed for people who do not normally wear glasses but view digital screens often, which is almost everyone.
We are essentially rebuffing this radiation and bringing fashion forward to stylish computer and gaming glasses for adults and children. We have thought of every member of the family.







 Zappi is thinking ahead to protecting the eyes of adults, teens and children from the damage of UV and blue light that's emitted from our much-loved technology. Our children start using digital devices from when they are toddlers and will have 25 years more exposure to the blue-violet light and UV that is emitted from our digital screens than we ever did, and this could certainly lead to eye disease in the future.                







We are making our computer eyewear accessible to as many people as we can and that is reflected in our exclusive Indiegogo perks. Zappi is keeping the prices low so you can make great savings on the final retail price. Also, you’ll save by sharing or teaming up with your friends and family to look after each other’s eyes, as the more of our glasses you purchase the cheaper they become. Take a look at our exclusive family bundle perks.


                            Choose your Zappi Wavelength Lens Technology
Zappi will contact you after our Indiegogo Campaign is closed for your choice of lens, frame style and color choice. You can see examples of the lenses and frames in the gallery



             


                              
                                                   Wearing Zappi Spectrum


High Protection Wavelength Lenses
Made from impact-resistant poly carbonate. Our lenses offer UV 400 protection, blocking 99.9% of harmful rays with a special AR (anti-reflective) coating on both sides of the lens to filter out the harmful blue light, and we added EMI coating on the front of the lens for extra protection for your eyes. They also reduce glare to the eyes and the lens is scratch resistant. 
Choose between clear-looking lenses with a slight tint or the more yellow lens 
Job done, protected!

     




                            Choose your frame 




Durable and flexible – Made from high quality poly carbonate, the frames are also flexible. We added the Zappi logo onto the temple.
Premium matte finish – With a special finishing on the frame to give them more comfort to keep your computer glasses in place.
Computer glasses frames - They are lightweight and fashionable to wear, and we have named each model with an electromagnetic theme.
We will ask you for your frame preferences after the Indiegogo campaign closes

It will charge your device whether it's day or night, rain or shine.  Your device will charge at the same rate as plugging it into the USB port of your computer or an electrical wall outlet at home. The Hybox is compact enough for travel, outdoor adventures off the grid, or stashing away at home for emergency situations.

Hybox is a Hand-Sized portable fuel power generator that allows you to power or charge any USB device with just a couple of drops of beverage, such as water, soda, juice, vinegar, and salt water, etc. You can charge your device any time any where with no limitations. Unlike the Solar-Powered Chargers, the Hybox generates energy instantly and never impacted by weather or solar position, you no longer need to stay at the same spot while your device is charging, or burnning yourself and device under the sun a whole day for just a single charge with the solar system. It will charge your device whether it's day or night, rain or shine.  Your device will charge at the same rate as plugging it into the USB port of your computer or an electrical wall outlet at home. The Hybox is compact enough for travel, outdoor adventures off the grid, or stashing away at home for emergency situations.


Off The Grid Outdoor Activities
No matter how far away you are from the outlet, know that the Hybox will be a power source for your devices. Whether on adventure trips, fishing or hunting, climbing, canoeing, or hiking, these are activities that most often take place in remote areas with no easy grid access.


Travel On The Go & Emergency Situations
When you're on the go, you don't really have time to charge your devices at a static location,  or there might even be no where to charge your devices, or you may also run out of power during intense communication use. Having a Hybox in your briefcase can helps and save you in certain mission critical situations.


How it works?


In the animation, you can see how Hybox(Micro) & Hybox(Mega) work. The light with the Hybox(Mega) is much brighter than the light with the Hybox(Micro), that's because the Hybox(Mega) generates more electricity than the Hybox(Micro).
SpecificationsNote: The quality of the liquid doesn't really matter, you could use the Hybox with the Used/Washed Water! But Please do not use it with any chemical liquid.(*) Works but not recommended(X) Doesn't Works

<p>We will set up our patented process to bring to you ABSOLUTELY FREE; Unlimited talk, local and international, free text, and free high speed internet services, with no hidden charges ever. The best part of this is you get to keep your same phone and same phone number. We guarantee, NO SHUT OFFS EVER, and NO minutes to purchase.  Not only that, you get free Netflix access which means you get to watch all the movies and TV shows you want.   Slim Cell Wireless pays netflix for you. You will no longer be a slave to those cell phone service providers. You get to watch all of the movies you want free. Play games free. Go on social media and stay on as long as you want, free. Send as many text messages as you want, free. And stay on your cell phone all day and all night if you want absolutely FREE.</p>
<p>Here is how it works.  When you place a call, you get a 15 second advertisement instead of a phone ringing in your ear. The advertisement will be targeted to you. You won't be bothered with ads that don't interest you.  Advertisers pay your phone costs.  Ads will also replace voice mail instructions, call waiting, and a couple of other areas.</p>
<p>I can remember a time when we were charged $15 dollars a month for one land line telephone per household. There were no talk limits, with a small charge for long distance calls. Now a family of five pays $500.00 per month, per household for five seperate cell phones. Often times these cell phones have limited talk text and internet use. There also used to be free TV with plenty of movies and our favorite shows. Now with cable tv it cost us $150.00 or more each month for the same movies and shows.</p>
<p>We at Slim Cell Wireless, believe those ridiculous charges can be done away with. Parents now-a-days,  with this lingering recession, find it difficult to provide basic food and clothing, housing, transportation, utilities, and medical necessities, while trying to maintain cell phone bills. Families have to choose between everyday neccessities and paying their cell phone bill. This problem is much worse for single parent families. That whole load falls on one parent. Then we have the minimum wage workers, some of whom have children and are single parents. Almost one third of their income goes to pay cell phone bills. Some have tuition,  car notes, Day- Care bills, on and on. I think you get the picture. The problem is worldwide. However, if we stand together as one; And launch this worldwide service we solve an economic problem for the whole world. We are all citizens of this planet and must all concern ourselves with the well being of others.  Your donations help us to help you, and your family and friends.</p>
<p>We at Slim Cell Wireless realize the importance of maintaining communication with the rest of the family and the rest of the world. Kids constantly have emergancies and need to contact parents. </p>
<p>With Slim Cell Wireless we free up your tight budget.  All the while we loosen up the countries recession and stimulate the economy with more purchasing power. With money saved with Slim Cell Wireless, you have extra money in your pocket to buy  things you have wanted to, but were unable to do.</p>
<p> After a small ONE TIME fee of just $70.00, we at Slim Cell Wireless not only bring you free unlimited talk, text, and free high speed internet, we give you free Netflix movies and T.V entertainment.</p>
<p>Our advertising dept. will see to it that you hear only the ads that interest you on your phone. Now you can gain these products through our patented discount methods. Every day you will be able to go to our website and check which gift has your cell number attached. There will be instructions for redeemimg your gift certificate. That gift will be for one of the ads that you heard on your cell phone. With this gift certificate program you can say we are paying you instead of you paying us for using your own phone. The more products you redeem or trade with other people for their certificate, the more products are manufactured. This creates more jobs, which in turn helps our economy.  Every body wins.</p>

<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Totally wireless? </h4>
<h4>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;""><p>Yes.
Camgiro uses low energy and <span>communicates through
Wifi. The typical range is up to 300ft (100m) depending on the situation, surroundings
like concrete walls, and WiFi strength. You can
also use a WiFi repeater or signal booster to extend the range. </span></p></span>
</h4>
<div><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;""><p><b>¿Es Totalmente inalámbrico?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Camgiro usa muy poca energía para comunicarse via Wifi, el
Rango de cobertura es de 100 metros con el control remoto y 200 metros con
Smartphone, pero depende de la situación y donde estés, si existen bardas con
cemento cambia la cobertura, pero si usas repetidores Wifi se puede ampliar.</p></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 24px;background-color: initial;"">Do I need to download the app to use Camgiro?</span><br/>
</div>
<h4></h4>

<p></p>
<p><b>¿Necesito bajar la app para usar Camgiro?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Si ordenas Camgiro con el control remoto Wifi no necesitas
bajar la app. Si ordenas solo el Camgiro, si tienes que bajar la app para mover
tu cámara de acción o de seguridad desde 90° , 180°  and 360°
 or Random  con un joystick virtual que tiene la app
o simplemente con tu voz.</p>
<h4>Is the Camgiro mobile app free?</h4>

<p></p>
<p><b>¿La app de Camgiro es gratis? </b></p>
<p>Totalmente Gratis estará lista en iOs o Android antes de ser
enviados los productos.</p>
<h4>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Will the Camgiro work with any Smartphone or tablet?</span><br/>
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>With most of them, yes, Camgiro is compatible with all iOS
and Android 4.3+ <span>Wi-Fi capable devices for
direct connection. Camgiro creates its own Wi-Fi Network, however,
no device can move your Camgiro if it doesn't have the appropriate codes. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>¿Camgiro opera con cualquier Smartphone o Tablet?</b></p>
<p>Casi la mayoría, Camgiro es compatible con los sistemas

Camgiro si no tiene los códigos apropiados de uso.</p>

Video 











English: While I was
practicing my favorite sport I noticed that sea sand messed
my action cam up and also that scenes direction was
always the same, so I thought of creating a device that could
direct the scenes direction
with a remote control, I googled it in order to buy one and to
my surprise, it wasn’t invented, seeing this as a
challenge, I talked with my team and we started creating
it,
It’s been an amusing project because of all our work with big companies, the Camgiro
Project is a fusion between work and practicing sports.
On the way we found that Camgiro
also helps rotate surveillance cameras.Español:   ¿Cómo nació la idea?Cuando
estaba practicando mi deporte favorito, todo el tiempo la cámara apuntaba en un
solo lado, y cuando la ponía de frente a cada rato se ensuciaba de arena de
mar, y pensé no será posible tenerle siempre viendo hacia atrás para que no se
ensucie? O que pueda cambiar el Angulo de los videos sin pararme a cada rato?  Busque en Internet un dispositivo económico que
pudiera hacer girar mi vídeo cámara en forma inalámbrica y no encontré nada a
precio razonable, al ser un apasionado en desarrollo de productos de tecnología,
lo comente con mi equipo de trabajo y decidimos llevarlo a cabo.  

We started developing technology many years ago, we initiated with bar-codes and RFID for Palm equipment. Nowadays
we have installed our systems to many companies, such
as Femsa Coca Cola, Nestle, GNP, Loreal, P&G, SteelCase, Codere,
Grupo Modelo (Corona Beer), Microsoft México, among others
Historia de éxito: Hace muchos años iniciamos desarrollando tecnología, comenzamos fabricando lectores de barras y RFID para Palm. A
la fecha hemos instalado nuestros sistemas en las empresas más reconocidas de
México como Femsa Coca Cola, Grupo modelo (Corona), P&G, Nestle, L’ Oreal,
Microsoft México, Codere, Steelcase, entre otras.
 



Totally wireless? 

Yes.
Camgiro uses low energy and communicates through
Wifi. The typical range is up to 300ft (100m) depending on the situation, surroundings
like concrete walls, and WiFi strength. You can
also use a WiFi repeater or signal booster to extend the range. 

¿Es Totalmente inalámbrico?
Camgiro usa muy poca energía para comunicarse via Wifi, el
Rango de cobertura es de 100 metros con el control remoto y 200 metros con
Smartphone, pero depende de la situación y donde estés, si existen bardas con
cemento cambia la cobertura, pero si usas repetidores Wifi se puede ampliar.

Do I need to download the app to use Camgiro?


If you order Camgiro+Bundle Wifi remote control No, but if you order only the Camgiro, Yes, the Camgiro app is required to move your Action or security cam from 90° , 180°  and 360°  or Random  with a Virtual Joy stick or your voice. 

¿Necesito bajar la app para usar Camgiro?
Si ordenas Camgiro con el control remoto Wifi no necesitas
bajar la app. Si ordenas solo el Camgiro, si tienes que bajar la app para mover
tu cámara de acción o de seguridad desde 90° , 180°  and 360°
 or Random  con un joystick virtual que tiene la app
o simplemente con tu voz.
Is the Camgiro mobile app free?
Absolutely! Available on iOS or Android before the products ships.

¿La app de Camgiro es gratis? 
Totalmente Gratis estará lista en iOs o Android antes de ser
enviados los productos.

Will the Camgiro work with any Smartphone or tablet?


With most of them, yes, Camgiro is compatible with all iOS
and Android 4.3+ Wi-Fi capable devices for
direct connection. Camgiro creates its own Wi-Fi Network, however,
no device can move your Camgiro if it doesn't have the appropriate codes. 

¿Camgiro opera con cualquier Smartphone o Tablet?
Casi la mayoría, Camgiro es compatible con los sistemas
operativos iOS más recientes y equipos Android 4.3+ con wifi. Camgiro crea su
propia red inalámbrica, sin embargo ningún otro dispositivo puede mover tu
Camgiro si no tiene los códigos apropiados de uso.



What happens to the money you raise?

The invested money will only be used for the manufacturing of your product - all funds will
be spent on tools
manufacturing setup and component costs.

¿Que uso darás con el dinero que se genere?
El dinero invertido será usado para la fabricación de tu
producto, todos los fondos se usarán para la manufactura, maquinaria y la
compra de componentes.
When will my Camgiro ship?

According to our plan we will start
shipping to Field Testers in August and to everyone
else in September 2016. Our field testers and
early supporters will receive their orders first.

¿Cuándo enviaran mi Camgiro?
De acuerdo a nuestro plan de
trabajo estaremos enviando a los primeros iniciadores en Agosto y a todo el mundo
iniciamos a finales de Septiembre. A los que hicieron
sus primeros pedidos y los primeros que nos apoyaron son los que recibirán las
primeras órdenes.

<p>BOAB has evolved to include
online lifestyle entertainment and specially designed apparel and wearable
technology that ANYONE can use to turn their smartphone into a hands free video
and still camera.</p>
<p>We started like many boarders do:</p>
<p> “Twelve years old; strapped wood boards to
our boots with cable bindings, climbed a hill and hoped for the best. Made it
down and upped the deal to the local ski hill. It sure looked challenging,
grabbing on to the towrope. It seemed to be going pretty damn fast, our gloves
were thin and it was cold. Next came the Rockies, standing on the side
of a mountain was an epic moment. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466630738/window_3_Snow_resize_lc3gji.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>We didn’t stop there because we
wanted to do more to help people capture the special moments in their lives. </p>
<p>That led us to create the patent

to the masses.
We have a system to turn your smartphone into a hands free, hassle

hi-Call 2.0 will use Bluetooth 4.0 that will allow us to insert various sensors in the glove. 

At the moment our idea is integrate sensors of: 

Temperature
Air pressure
Humidity

Pulse sensor. 


All these sensors will communicate with an app that tells to you the measured values and elaborate that to predict the weather and create charts cardiac detected, for example, during sports.

We will also focus on textile parts of glove that we want to improve to make it even more beautiful, comfortable, durable and boobies.





Also we wanna improve the electronic components to enhance the sound of phone calls and the battery life.

At the end will be an incredible smart gloves something that will be very useful for the people!

Risks & Challenges


This is definitely the most ambitious project that our company hi-Fun srl has ever faced in its history, but we are confident of being able to accomplish as we always did when we tried to overcome our limitations.

<p><b><u>Update 29th April 2016</u></b></p>
<p>Good news for backers!</p>
<p>Michał Taszycki (<a href=""https://twitter.com/mehowte"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://twitter.com/mehowte</a>) a C64 enthusiast himself, has donated nine video tutorials on programming the Commodore 64 for all backers!</p>
<p>64 Bites (<a href=""http://64bites.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://64bites.com</a>) is an ongoing series of weekly videos that can teach you how to program your beloved Commodore 64, and in turn THEC64!</p>
<p>Each episode takes just 5 minutes to watch, so it can easily fit your busy schedule. Videos come with full transcript, source code, and exercises. Each one focuses on explaining one concept. In other words, each video is a tasty bite of C64 knowledge that brings you closer to finally writing that game and demo. The series starts literally from basics of BASIC but quickly transitions into the assembly, where the real fun happens. There are already 45 episodes released and many more to come.</p>
<p>After the project is funded, all backers will receive the 64Bites - Season 1 ""From BASIC to Assembly"" (<a href=""http://64bites.com/seasons/001-from-basic-to-assembly/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://64bites.com/seasons/001-from-basic-to-as...</a>) for free and a 50% discount for the next season. Season 1 is normally worth $19.99 and contains </p>
<p>- first nine episodes (50+ minutes of DRM-free videos in total)</p>
<p>- transcripts (7500+ words) - source code examples (450+ LOC).</p>
<p>- programming exercises for each episode.</p>

<p><b><u>Update 20<sup>th</sup> April 2016</u></b></p>
<p>We’ve had so many requests for the gory technical details, that we just couldn’t refuse to send out an update!</p>
<p>At the core of THEC64 is a low cost, high power ARM Cortex SoC, which provides all the modern interfaces demanded by today’s consumers. This has clear advantages for the consumer. Creating a software/hardware hybrid machine allows THEC64 ™ to be both affordable and flexible, and delivers a product that can expand to meet users future needs. A pure hardware implementation, on the other hand, fixes the specification at design time, and we feel that this is too limiting a solution and a substantial risk. Gate arrays are too costly to give an economic solution.</p>
<p>We are huge fans of the Commodore 64, and our dream is to make THEC64 ™ affordable and attractive to all users, new and old. THEC64 ™ will be available again for the first time in 25 years. We are committed to THEC64 ™ and open source community, and will be releasing as much as we can as open source to empower the community to help steer the future direction of THEC64™ . You just can’t beat passion!</p>
<p>When we created the C64DTV we faced similar challenges. Creating Commodore hardware that will accurately run the BIOS and software is a challenge, whether that’s a custom ASIC or an off the shelf programmable FPGA, it requires a considerable amount of time, effort and resources. And we learned from that. We can improve on the limited expandability of the C64DTV!</p>
<p>We’re doing other things around THEC64™  in addition to launching a new set of machines, such as licensing some of the best C64 programming books ever created. These will come out in both paperback and eBook formats. We are creating matching joysticks, cartridge converters to allow old original C64 cartridges to work with the new machine, potentially original joystick converters if the demand is there, and so on. We want to create the perfect experience for old and new fans alike.</p>
<p>That’s without some of the classic and specially commissioned all-new games we will be releasing for THEC64 ™ computer and console.</p>
<p>Thanks from THEC64™ team!</p>
</div><div>___________<p> </p>
<p><b>THEC64 ™</b> is being designed and developed by a team led by a world class software and hardware engineer. He is aided by a technical team from around the world.</p>
<p><b>THEC64</b> ™ project is headed up by video game industry veteran Darren Melbourne who conceptualized and bought to market the C64DTV ™ console as well as dozens of other game related products during a video games career that has spanned over thirty years.</p>
<p><b>THEC64 ™</b> gaming team is built around a group of people with many years of games creation and intellectual property licensing experience!  The foundation of the team is their love of the Commodore 64 ™ and it is this passion that shines through with the creation of the games software for THEC64 ™. Key team members are also integral parts of the C64  community, working tirelessly to preserve and maintain the C64 , keeping the scene vibrant and alive.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is intended to raise the necessary funds to manufacture the first production units of <b>THEC64 ™</b> which will be shipped to the  backers of the campaign., The campaign will also enable  us prepare us for the global retail production launch of <b>THEC64 ™</b></p>
<p>By supporting this project it will allow you to be one of the first to own one of the new <b>THEC64 ™</b> consoles. All backers who have pledged for one of the consoles can choose to receive one of <b>THEC64 ™</b> range (computer or handheld versions) from our first and numbered production run.  Backers of this campaign are also ensuring the continued existence and survival of the greatest home computer of all time.</p>
<p>There is also an exciting range of other <b>THEC64 ™</b> campaign backers perks, including: signed limited edition concept art originals, posters, limited edition chrome computers, and even getting your name on the PCB!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b><u>Why TWO different computers/consoles?</u></b></p>
<p>Since its inception our plan has always to bring both a classic home computer, as well as a games console to the market. We did not want to fall into the trap of releasing the computer and then twelve months later releasing the console.  In this way backers of the campaign can choose either - the home computer, the handheld 64 (THE 64SX ™) or both, donating appropriately to our ideas on these concepts. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><u>What games are included with THEC64 ™?</u></b></p>
<p>This is where it gets interesting for fans of retro gaming! We are already speaking to a wide range of rights holders with regards to including their games on <b>THEC64 ™</b>! We will announce these over the coming weeks, once the campaign is underway, and we can speak more openly about the titles.. All we can say at this point is you are going to be very, very happy. Whilst we will include some absolute retro game classics, we hope to include some all new games, which have 30+ years of new programming techniques to delight you, and we will also be bringing some mystery games that you will just have to see to believe! Keep watching this space for updates, we will do our very best.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><u>Can I add other games to THEC64 ™ computer/consoles?</u></b></p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes! We are making <b>THEC64 ™</b> computers and consoles REALLY easy to add more games to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460641554/THE64_labelled_diagram_desktop_cmzidw.png"" src=""""/></p>(Concept Idea Renders)<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><u>The development of THEC64 Computer/Consoles</u></b></p>
<p><b>THEC64 ™ </b>computers and consoles <b>feature all new </b>core technology, based around the classic 64 architecture and is being designed and developed by a team of expert developers, many of whom have already created the technology behind several other classic retro consoles.</p>
<p><b>THEC64 ™ </b>case concept designs have been created by our own team of experienced, creative and passionate in-house designers, who have created a beautiful concept homage to the C64. An incredible new concept design one with one eye fixed very firmly in the past. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><u>Technical Specifications</u></b></p>
<p>The specifications for <b>THEC64 ™</b> are not fixed at this point in time - we will be engaging with the community and customers over the coming months to deliver the best product we can! We want to hear from you guys what you want us to add!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the core of THEC64 ™ is a low cost, high power ARM Cortex SoC, which provides all the modern interfaces demanded by today’s consumers. This has clear advantages for the consumer. Creating a software/hardware hybrid machine allows THEC64 <b>™ </b>to be both affordable and flexible, and delivers a product that can expand to meet users future needs. A pure hardware implementation, on the other hand, fixes the specification at design time, and we feel that this is too limiting a solution and a substantial risk. Gate arrays are too costly to give an economic solution.</p> <p>Specifications that are fixed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accurate recreation of the classic Commodore 64.</li>
<li>HDMI video and audio output.</li>
<li>We are considering composite video in addition to HDMI, for use on classic televisions.</li>
<li>Multiple SIDs for stereo sound (6581 or 8580)</li>
<li>New high-capacity (512MB+) writable cartridge support, with an adapter interface available later to provide classic cartridge compatibility.</li>
<li>Support for current storage media (for example SD cards), with emulation of the 1541.</li>
<li>Multiple joystick support for multi-player games.</li>
<li>Support for many of the popular emulator game file formats.</li>
<li>Firmware upgradable to support additional features and machines in the future (DTV64 features, etc.)</li>
<li>Hopefully the possibility to connect original peripherals, or via adaptors.</li>
</ul>
<div>THEC64 ™ has the same programmability as the original C64, so you can write your own software in BASIC or 6502 assembly (given a suitable assembler). You can therefore re-live the experience of learning to code on such a classic machine, but with the advantage of being able to save your programs onto modern storage, such as SD card, for instant retrieval.</div>

<p><b><u>THEC64 ™ - Current Status</u></b><b>  </b></p>
<p>The core research and development of <b>THEC64 ™</b> consoles is complete, and we have working prototypes ongoing, concept case models, and software waiting to go into production as soon as practical. Production and shipping of the first <b>THEC64 ™</b> consoles for the campaign backers where planned for early December 2016 (but now revised to Spring 2018), Given the chance, and with encouragement from all our supporters, we will reach our funding goal quickly and perhaps we be able to improve on this delivery date potentially. Sadly due to not making our hoped for target time lines have moved but it is coming!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><u>Inspiration for THEC64 ™ computer and consoles</u></b></p>
<p><b>THEC64 ™</b> is the culmination of many years of dedication, and perseverance by our team, who individually and collectively have worked to create something truly special.  We hope that our project resonates with those who grew up with and were inspired by the global phenomena which was the Commodore 64 ™. We hope that both old and new users of the original computer will want to rekindle their passion and will once again be inspired by this new incarnation of that legendary machine. The 64 is dead, Long Live THEC64 ™!</p>

Update 29th April 2016
Good news for backers!
Michał Taszycki (https://twitter.com/mehowte) a C64 enthusiast himself, has donated nine video tutorials on programming the Commodore 64 for all backers!
64 Bites (http://64bites.com) is an ongoing series of weekly videos that can teach you how to program your beloved Commodore 64, and in turn THEC64!
Each episode takes just 5 minutes to watch, so it can easily fit your busy schedule. Videos come with full transcript, source code, and exercises. Each one focuses on explaining one concept. In other words, each video is a tasty bite of C64 knowledge that brings you closer to finally writing that game and demo. The series starts literally from basics of BASIC but quickly transitions into the assembly, where the real fun happens. There are already 45 episodes released and many more to come.
After the project is funded, all backers will receive the 64Bites - Season 1 ""From BASIC to Assembly"" (http://64bites.com/seasons/001-from-basic-to-as...) for free and a 50% discount for the next season. Season 1 is normally worth $19.99 and contains 
- first nine episodes (50+ minutes of DRM-free videos in total)
- transcripts (7500+ words) - source code examples (450+ LOC).
- programming exercises for each episode.

Update 20th April 2016
We’ve had so many requests for the gory technical details, that we just couldn’t refuse to send out an update!
At the core of THEC64 is a low cost, high power ARM Cortex SoC, which provides all the modern interfaces demanded by today’s consumers. This has clear advantages for the consumer. Creating a software/hardware hybrid machine allows THEC64 ™ to be both affordable and flexible, and delivers a product that can expand to meet users future needs. A pure hardware implementation, on the other hand, fixes the specification at design time, and we feel that this is too limiting a solution and a substantial risk. Gate arrays are too costly to give an economic solution.
We are huge fans of the Commodore 64, and our dream is to make THEC64 ™ affordable and attractive to all users, new and old. THEC64 ™ will be available again for the first time in 25 years. We are committed to THEC64 ™ and open source community, and will be releasing as much as we can as open source to empower the community to help steer the future direction of THEC64™ . You just can’t beat passion!
When we created the C64DTV we faced similar challenges. Creating Commodore hardware that will accurately run the BIOS and software is a challenge, whether that’s a custom ASIC or an off the shelf programmable FPGA, it requires a considerable amount of time, effort and resources. And we learned from that. We can improve on the limited expandability of the C64DTV!
We’re doing other things around THEC64™  in addition to launching a new set of machines, such as licensing some of the best C64 programming books ever created. These will come out in both paperback and eBook formats. We are creating matching joysticks, cartridge converters to allow old original C64 cartridges to work with the new machine, potentially original joystick converters if the demand is there, and so on. We want to create the perfect experience for old and new fans alike.
That’s without some of the classic and specially commissioned all-new games we will be releasing for THEC64 ™ computer and console.
Thanks from THEC64™ team!
___________ 
THEC64 ™ is being designed and developed by a team led by a world class software and hardware engineer. He is aided by a technical team from around the world.
THEC64 ™ project is headed up by video game industry veteran Darren Melbourne who conceptualized and bought to market the C64DTV ™ console as well as dozens of other game related products during a video games career that has spanned over thirty years.
THEC64 ™ gaming team is built around a group of people with many years of games creation and intellectual property licensing experience!  The foundation of the team is their love of the Commodore 64 ™ and it is this passion that shines through with the creation of the games software for THEC64 ™. Key team members are also integral parts of the C64  community, working tirelessly to preserve and maintain the C64 , keeping the scene vibrant and alive.
This Indiegogo campaign is intended to raise the necessary funds to manufacture the first production units of THEC64 ™ which will be shipped to the  backers of the campaign., The campaign will also enable  us prepare us for the global retail production launch of THEC64 ™
By supporting this project it will allow you to be one of the first to own one of the new THEC64 ™ consoles. All backers who have pledged for one of the consoles can choose to receive one of THEC64 ™ range (computer or handheld versions) from our first and numbered production run.  Backers of this campaign are also ensuring the continued existence and survival of the greatest home computer of all time.
There is also an exciting range of other THEC64 ™ campaign backers perks, including: signed limited edition concept art originals, posters, limited edition chrome computers, and even getting your name on the PCB!
 
(Concept Ideas Renders) 
 
Why TWO different computers/consoles?
Since its inception our plan has always to bring both a classic home computer, as well as a games console to the market. We did not want to fall into the trap of releasing the computer and then twelve months later releasing the console.  In this way backers of the campaign can choose either - the home computer, the handheld 64 (THE 64SX ™) or both, donating appropriately to our ideas on these concepts. 
 
What games are included with THEC64 ™?
This is where it gets interesting for fans of retro gaming! We are already speaking to a wide range of rights holders with regards to including their games on THEC64 ™! We will announce these over the coming weeks, once the campaign is underway, and we can speak more openly about the titles.. All we can say at this point is you are going to be very, very happy. Whilst we will include some absolute retro game classics, we hope to include some all new games, which have 30+ years of new programming techniques to delight you, and we will also be bringing some mystery games that you will just have to see to believe! Keep watching this space for updates, we will do our very best.
 
Can I add other games to THEC64 ™ computer/consoles?
Yes, yes, yes! We are making THEC64 ™ computers and consoles REALLY easy to add more games to.
 
(Concept Idea Renders) 
 
 
The development of THEC64 Computer/Consoles
THEC64 ™ computers and consoles feature all new core technology, based around the classic 64 architecture and is being designed and developed by a team of expert developers, many of whom have already created the technology behind several other classic retro consoles.
THEC64 ™ case concept designs have been created by our own team of experienced, creative and passionate in-house designers, who have created a beautiful concept homage to the C64. An incredible new concept design one with one eye fixed very firmly in the past. 
 
Technical Specifications
The specifications for THEC64 ™ are not fixed at this point in time - we will be engaging with the community and customers over the coming months to deliver the best product we can! We want to hear from you guys what you want us to add!
 
At the core of THEC64 ™ is a low cost, high power ARM Cortex SoC, which provides all the modern interfaces demanded by today’s consumers. This has clear advantages for the consumer. Creating a software/hardware hybrid machine allows THEC64 ™ to be both affordable and flexible, and delivers a product that can expand to meet users future needs. A pure hardware implementation, on the other hand, fixes the specification at design time, and we feel that this is too limiting a solution and a substantial risk. Gate arrays are too costly to give an economic solution. Specifications that are fixed are:

Accurate recreation of the classic Commodore 64.
HDMI video and audio output.
We are considering composite video in addition to HDMI, for use on classic televisions.
Multiple SIDs for stereo sound (6581 or 8580)
New high-capacity (512MB+) writable cartridge support, with an adapter interface available later to provide classic cartridge compatibility.
Support for current storage media (for example SD cards), with emulation of the 1541.
Multiple joystick support for multi-player games.
Support for many of the popular emulator game file formats.
Firmware upgradable to support additional features and machines in the future (DTV64 features, etc.)
Hopefully the possibility to connect original peripherals, or via adaptors.

THEC64 ™ has the same programmability as the original C64, so you can write your own software in BASIC or 6502 assembly (given a suitable assembler). You can therefore re-live the experience of learning to code on such a classic machine, but with the advantage of being able to save your programs onto modern storage, such as SD card, for instant retrieval.
 
(Concept Box design for THEC64 ™)  
THEC64 ™ - Current Status  
The core research and development of THEC64 ™ consoles is complete, and we have working prototypes ongoing, concept case models, and software waiting to go into production as soon as practical. Production and shipping of the first THEC64 ™ consoles for the campaign backers where planned for early December 2016 (but now revised to Spring 2018), Given the chance, and with encouragement from all our supporters, we will reach our funding goal quickly and perhaps we be able to improve on this delivery date potentially. Sadly due to not making our hoped for target time lines have moved but it is coming!
 
Inspiration for THEC64 ™ computer and consoles
THEC64 ™ is the culmination of many years of dedication, and perseverance by our team, who individually and collectively have worked to create something truly special.  We hope that our project resonates with those who grew up with and were inspired by the global phenomena which was the Commodore 64 ™. We hope that both old and new users of the original computer will want to rekindle their passion and will once again be inspired by this new incarnation of that legendary machine. The 64 is dead, Long Live THEC64 ™!

<p><b><i>BB Energy group</i></b> is a company formed by a group of young people who look for the improvement of people’s life quality. We want to make people's daily life easier through <b><i>technology and renewable sources</i></b>.</p>
<p>Our most popular product is the <b><i>solar deck chair</i></b>, which allows people who use it to recharge their mobile devices (smartphone, tablet, ebook…) while they are sunbathing.</p>
<p><i><b>It all started</b></i> last summer when we were sunbathing on the beach and using our mobile phones; listening to music and searching for some information on the internet. Soon our battery ran out and we were offline for the rest of the day. What would have happened if we had an emergency? At that moment, this idea hit us. Why not invent deck chairs that allow you to enjoy your devices without worrying about the battery?</p>
<p>The company, which was recently created, has worked with important <b><i>customers</i></b> <b><i>such as Barcelona’s City Hall</i></b>, which has made our chairs available to citizens and tourists in a public square of the city (Pl./Joan Antoni Coderch, Glòries) and it seems there has been a great response from users.</p>

BB Energy group is a company formed by a group of young people who look for the improvement of people’s life quality. We want to make people's daily life easier through technology and renewable sources.
Our most popular product is the solar deck chair, which allows people who use it to recharge their mobile devices (smartphone, tablet, ebook…) while they are sunbathing.
It all started last summer when we were sunbathing on the beach and using our mobile phones; listening to music and searching for some information on the internet. Soon our battery ran out and we were offline for the rest of the day. What would have happened if we had an emergency? At that moment, this idea hit us. Why not invent deck chairs that allow you to enjoy your devices without worrying about the battery?
The company, which was recently created, has worked with important customers such as Barcelona’s City Hall, which has made our chairs available to citizens and tourists in a public square of the city (Pl./Joan Antoni Coderch, Glòries) and it seems there has been a great response from users.
    What do we solve?

Currently some mobile devices have numerous applications that quickly drain the battery. When you are at home, charging your battery to 100% is easily done, since you only have to look for an outlet to charge your device. The problem occurs when you don't have access to an outlet. For leisure or for emergencies, we believe that it is important that this doesn't happen.

What do we propose?The solar deck chair charges your electronic devices (smartphone, tablet, ebook…) while you are sunbathing!
    Our philosophy
BB Energy Group is born with the unique purpose of making this world better. Through our products, we seek the improvement of people's life quality, based on our maximum respect to this world and it's resources. 
This purpose concerns both natural and social environment. One of our main objectives is giving jobs to people in a long time unemployment situation, especially those who are more than 45 years old with familiar responsibilities, one of the social groups that is suffering crisis the most.
The value of the company is that we promote dignified working conditions in order to look after our employees.
Furthermore, when the company gets a stable minimum of benefits, we will dedicate a part of these to social actions.
To sum up, we want to take care of our environment and people who form it.
Our market

This product is patented in Spain and is in the process of patenting in Europe, United States and several Caribbean and Asian islands. The product is primarily intended for companies (especially in tourism sector: hotels, cruises...) and individuals who want to have our chairs in their gardens. 
There is not any company that manufactures the same product currently.
We offer the chance of buying the complete kit (deck chair + solar kit) for an good price. In the case that the the customer already has a deck chair, our company offers the chance of obtaining just the solar kit (solar cell + fastening bars), which can be integrated to any deck chair.

*This product can be send to all countries of the world.


Our economic goal


Basically we need about 50,000$ which we will allocate to export and sell to interested companies who have contacted us around the world, licenses and certificates, new contracts of staff and finally to the purchase and transport large volume of material. In addition, part of the investment will be destinated to rent our own working building.
We have worked with Barcelona's City Hall by the moment. In fact, it was our first customer, demanding 4 solar deck chairs for a public square in the city as a test mode. As it seems is successful, they might demand for more. In addition, we are in contact with several other customers from national and international level to sell more solar deck chairs.


    What can you do
You can donate from 1$ to 1000$ to our campaing.
If it is imposible for whatever reason, we also will appreciate to share and spread it!

And that means a mobile app for when you are out at friends, on the couch all weekend binging your favorite show, or out with friends watching a new movie.  </p><p>For moviegoers, I really want to create a new
experience.  We want to let 
users tune-in to a movie, include their
friends; and as they watch the movie, tag their favorite moments, quotes,
Easter Eggs, or whatever they see and want to share.</p><p>This means the mobile app will have a unique feature: Theater Mode. 
This will dim 
the screen, similar to the red light dimming function of other tools for
those who work at night like the military, pilots, or even astronomers. 


</p><div> </div><ul> <li>I am Kevin Hall, and I first crowdsourced and built the first web version of Snackdish one year ago thanks to passionate people who saw the potential in this idea, and how it could help express themselves, and connect them with their friends.</li> <li>This has been an amazing passion project to bring this to light, and I look forward moving this to the next step, to get the Snackdish app in the hands of more people where they want it, when they want it.</li>

</ul> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div> </div><p>Our plan:</p><div> </div><ul> <li>We need to raise $46,000 do develop a mobile IOS app for iPhone/iPad. This includes converting the form factor/user experience from the current web platform and develop Snackdish to the unique capabilities of the Apple platform. </li> <li>We have a great set of PERKS to thank you, to keep you engaged, to get the new Snackdish app in your hands, and to have some fun (like an EXCLUSIVE Movie screening).</li> <li>If we exceed our goal, then we plan to extend the mobile experience to other platforms (like Android) and to include a suite of notifications to help keep friends connected around your shared TV and movie watching.  If we fall short (don't let us fall short), then it's about bridging any gap.  We'll  get there it, but will take a little longer.</li>

NO outside money.  That means we need help from those who believe in the power of crowdsourcing, those who believe in transforming the moviegoing experience, and those who understand the power of the shared experience of movies and TV shows.</p><p>Help us and make a difference. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Challenges and Controversy</h3><p>The biggest risk that we face is that some people will not like the idea that people can tune-in to movies and use Snackdish in theaters.  This will be a controversial idea those.   As it is, movies theaters have had an almost 100 year
head start in defining and controlling the experience.  That’s a lot of cultural momentum to overcome.   But
enforcing this status quo, actually prevents innovation, and new
tools that might let moviegoers have new experiences.  </p><p>
</p><p>At Snackdish we are trying to break through this barrier.  And when the Snackdish app is in your hands, you will be in
control and without limits; and you will have the first exclusive opportunity
to use your phone without bothering those around you.</p>

And that means a mobile app for when you are out at friends, on the couch all weekend binging your favorite show, or out with friends watching a new movie.  For moviegoers, I really want to create a new
experience.  We want to let 
users tune-in to a movie, include their
friends; and as they watch the movie, tag their favorite moments, quotes,
Easter Eggs, or whatever they see and want to share.This means the mobile app will have a unique feature: Theater Mode. 
This will dim 
the screen, similar to the red light dimming function of other tools for
those who work at night like the military, pilots, or even astronomers. 


  I am Kevin Hall, and I first crowdsourced and built the first web version of Snackdish one year ago thanks to passionate people who saw the potential in this idea, and how it could help express themselves, and connect them with their friends. This has been an amazing passion project to bring this to light, and I look forward moving this to the next step, to get the Snackdish app in the hands of more people where they want it, when they want it.

  What We Need & What You Get Our plan:  We need to raise $46,000 do develop a mobile IOS app for iPhone/iPad. This includes converting the form factor/user experience from the current web platform and develop Snackdish to the unique capabilities of the Apple platform.  We have a great set of PERKS to thank you, to keep you engaged, to get the new Snackdish app in your hands, and to have some fun (like an EXCLUSIVE Movie screening). If we exceed our goal, then we plan to extend the mobile experience to other platforms (like Android) and to include a suite of notifications to help keep friends connected around your shared TV and movie watching.  If we fall short (don't let us fall short), then it's about bridging any gap.  We'll  get there it, but will take a little longer.
Snackdish Mockups in Theater Mode.    The Impact Snackdish has been completely bootstrapped. NO outside money.  That means we need help from those who believe in the power of crowdsourcing, those who believe in transforming the moviegoing experience, and those who understand the power of the shared experience of movies and TV shows.Help us and make a difference. Challenges and ControversyThe biggest risk that we face is that some people will not like the idea that people can tune-in to movies and use Snackdish in theaters.  This will be a controversial idea those.   As it is, movies theaters have had an almost 100 year
head start in defining and controlling the experience.  That’s a lot of cultural momentum to overcome.   But
enforcing this status quo, actually prevents innovation, and new
tools that might let moviegoers have new experiences.  
At Snackdish we are trying to break through this barrier.  And when the Snackdish app is in your hands, you will be in
control and without limits; and you will have the first exclusive opportunity
to use your phone without bothering those around you.
    Other Ways You Can Help 

If you cannot contribute you can still help Snackdish and stay engaged by following Snackdish on Twitter, and Facebook.  And hey, join the revolution and start using Snackdish now at www.snackdish.com when you watch your favorite shows and movies; and start connecting with your friends.
You can share this campaign with your friends using these the Indiegogo share tools!

Ant that's all there is to it!

<h3>Guten Tag and welcome!</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Sanorah aka <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/langstruggles/?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Struggling Linguist</a>. I'm an avid language learner and enthusiast with the goal of becoming a true polyglot. That is to say a speaker of many languages. Over the past years of studying over a dozen languages, I've come to find the one recurring flaw no matter the language being studied; the lack of meaningful social interactions. It's my problem and I'm pretty sure it's a large part of your fluency issues as well.</p>
<p><strong>I want to help you reach your fluency goals!</strong></p>
<p>I believe the fastest way to fluency is by using the language. The more we are immersed in meaningful usage, the faster our journey to fluency will be. I have thus come up with a platform that I believe will help people the world over discover and connect to the language community at large whenever and wherever they like. It's the dream app for the traveling polyglot. Here's how I want to help you <strong>solve your current language learning problems:</strong></p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li><strong>Have one platform to search and discover all things language related</strong></li>
<li><strong>Connect with language exchange partners who share interests outside of language</strong></li>
<li><strong>Promote your events/services to a relevant crowd</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602269035/m0jf8evaslamaarizcf5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I believe in <strong>language acquisition</strong> and by having a convenient means of staying immersed in one's own backyard <strong>through meaningful real life interactions</strong>, fluency will become more than just a pipe dream.</p>
<h3><strong>What is The Braun Pages &amp; How Does It Work</strong></h3>
<p>Think of The Braun Pages as you would the Yellow Pages (a telephone directory) but cooler and more relevant to you. Whether you’re searching for a person or service, it’s all there in <u><strong>one convenient location</strong></u>. The Braun Pages is a directory-based marketing app strictly reserved for the language community.</p>
<p>Post can be made in various categories such as :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Games</strong> (promote &amp; market your language games)</li>
<li>
<strong>Travel &amp; Leisure</strong> (take a trip with a focus on language)</li>
<li>
<strong>Academia</strong> (find schools &amp; tutors)</li>
<li>
<strong>Translations</strong> (find services for your personal or business needs)</li>
<li>
<strong>Language Partners</strong> (connect with people in your local community)</li>
<li>
<strong>Events &amp; Gatherings</strong> (always be in the know of what's happening)</li>
<li>
<strong>Mommy &amp; Me</strong> (grow your child/youth based language service, immerse your little ones)</li>
</ul>
<p>By using the same technology present in dating and location apps, <strong>The Braun Pages will keep you connected</strong> to others near you. Moving? Traveling? No problem, just switch the city and now you know what's happening so you can stay social whenever and wherever you want. </p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
</div><div>
<p>It goes without saying that your financial contributions will not only show your interest in the platform but will be the fuel needed to power the project in a professional manner. The Braun Pages works best with a large user database. The more people &amp; services sign up, the more useful it will be.</p>
<ul>
<li>An initial funding of $50K will help bring the project to fruition with the help and guidance of professionals.</li>
<li>Your contributions could get a you some awesome prizes such as tickets to upcoming language events</li>
<li>Should the full amount not be raised, funds will be used to move the project forward as best as can be done, more research and marketing.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact : Advantages over other platforms</h3>
<p>Unlike a platform like Meetup where only the organizer pays an exorbitant fee twice a year, everyone here pays the same low yearly fee to post their events and language partner exchange whether big or small. No need to join several different groups.</p>
<p>The advantage that it holds over Facebook &amp; Instagram, don't get lost in the medley of this and that. Your post will show up on the suggested date. Members can choose a date and location (either on or offline) and be shown all relevant posts for that day. Posts are displayed by earliest upcoming events as well as nearest to you for offline events. Again, no need to join endless groups or endless scrolling.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Braun Pages</strong> will give you the <strong>convenience</strong> of searching for exactly what you want.</li>
<li>
<strong>Don't get lost</strong> in a potpourri of irrelevant posts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Post/search events in any city</strong> as you move/travel.</li>
<li>
<strong>Discover </strong>events, games, people and so much more!</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<strong>Are you a business?!</strong> <strong>Get discovered by the customers you're looking for quickly, easily and effectively.</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Promote</strong> your services &amp; events</li>
<li>
<strong>Reach the large relevant audience</strong> you're after</li>
<li>
<strong>Grow your sales</strong> potential (mass messaging, banner promotions, and more)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602269162/xx1pixdftqdffi1pie0p.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with anything in life, you can't fail if you don't try and the for the best chances at success be prepared. There are no plans to fail but all efforts are being made to be prepared in order to produce and present a product that is worth using.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Your support and contributions will ensure the best outcome</strong> by having skilled and dedicated people working to keep you connected.</li>
<li>Growing a database from scratch is no easy task. By <strong>working together to share The Braun Pages</strong> we can have the best outcome possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>The Team</strong></h2>
<p>The project will be prepared and presented by BoutSourcing ( <a href=""https://boutsourcing.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://boutsourcing.com/</a> ) They are passionate developers and techies eager to bring this unique project to life.</p>
<h2><strong>The Timeline</strong></h2>
<p><strong>8000K</strong> : At this level development gets started with a sprint phase. The team will begin the development of the app. ( If you are a Decision Maker, your input starts here to the end.) This step is expected to take 4-5 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>18000K</strong> : At this price point all efforts to produce a working prototype testing should be around the corner. It will also allow a boost to the marketing and promotion of the app. (This step is expected to take 4-6 weeks.)</p>
<p><strong>30000K</strong> : At this level bonus special features can begin to be added. More marketing can be done and a proper beta product should be available. ( This step is expected to take 4-5 weeks)</p>
<p><strong>50000K</strong> : At this point you will have a functional beta app. Proper marketing will have been put in place and can continue to help the growth of the app.</p>
<p><strong>65000K</strong> : Goal reached! Should we be so lucky to reach our goal with your support, you will have a fully functioning app ready for use complete with chat options, powerful search optimization and more.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Perhaps it's not possible for you to contribute financially and that's understandable. But there are ways you can help support the cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like, follow and <strong>share this campaign</strong> with your friends and family</li>
<li>
<strong>Sign up</strong> to be a beta tester</li>
<li>Email us about people/services in your area that cater to the language community. The <strong>larger the database of users, the better the service</strong> becomes</li>
</ul>
</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Guten Tag and welcome!

It's the dream app for the traveling polyglot. Here's how I want to help you solve your current language learning problems:

Have one platform to search and discover all things language related
Connect with language exchange partners who share interests outside of language
Promote your events/services to a relevant crowd


I believe in language acquisition and by having a convenient means of staying immersed in one's own backyard through meaningful real life interactions, fluency will become more than just a pipe dream.
What is The Braun Pages & How Does It Work
Think of The Braun Pages as you would the Yellow Pages (a telephone directory) but cooler and more relevant to you. Whether you’re searching for a person or service, it’s all there in one convenient location. The Braun Pages is a directory-based marketing app strictly reserved for the language community.
Post can be made in various categories such as :


Games (promote & market your language games)

Travel & Leisure (take a trip with a focus on language)

Academia (find schools & tutors)

Translations (find services for your personal or business needs)

Language Partners (connect with people in your local community)

Events & Gatherings (always be in the know of what's happening)

Mommy & Me (grow your child/youth based language service, immerse your little ones)

By using the same technology present in dating and location apps, The Braun Pages will keep you connected to others near you. Moving? Traveling? No problem, just switch the city and now you know what's happening so you can stay social whenever and wherever you want. 
What We Need & What You Get

It goes without saying that your financial contributions will not only show your interest in the platform but will be the fuel needed to power the project in a professional manner. The Braun Pages works best with a large user database. The more people & services sign up, the more useful it will be.

An initial funding of $50K will help bring the project to fruition with the help and guidance of professionals.
Your contributions could get a you some awesome prizes such as tickets to upcoming language events
Should the full amount not be raised, funds will be used to move the project forward as best as can be done, more research and marketing.


The Impact : Advantages over other platforms
Unlike a platform like Meetup where only the organizer pays an exorbitant fee twice a year, everyone here pays the same low yearly fee to post their events and language partner exchange whether big or small. No need to join several different groups.
The advantage that it holds over Facebook & Instagram, don't get lost in the medley of this and that. Your post will show up on the suggested date. Members can choose a date and location (either on or offline) and be shown all relevant posts for that day. Posts are displayed by earliest upcoming events as well as nearest to you for offline events. Again, no need to join endless groups or endless scrolling.


The Braun Pages will give you the convenience of searching for exactly what you want.

Don't get lost in a potpourri of irrelevant posts.

Post/search events in any city as you move/travel.

Discover events, games, people and so much more!


Are you a business?! Get discovered by the customers you're looking for quickly, easily and effectively.



Promote your services & events

Reach the large relevant audience you're after

Grow your sales potential (mass messaging, banner promotions, and more)

 

 

Risks & Challenges
As with anything in life, you can't fail if you don't try and the for the best chances at success be prepared. There are no plans to fail but all efforts are being made to be prepared in order to produce and present a product that is worth using.


Your support and contributions will ensure the best outcome by having skilled and dedicated people working to keep you connected.
Growing a database from scratch is no easy task. By working together to share The Braun Pages we can have the best outcome possible.

The Team
The project will be prepared and presented by BoutSourcing ( https://boutsourcing.com/ ) They are passionate developers and techies eager to bring this unique project to life.
The Timeline
8000K : At this level development gets started with a sprint phase. The team will begin the development of the app. ( If you are a Decision Maker, your input starts here to the end.) This step is expected to take 4-5 weeks.
18000K : At this price point all efforts to produce a working prototype testing should be around the corner. It will also allow a boost to the marketing and promotion of the app. (This step is expected to take 4-6 weeks.)
30000K : At this level bonus special features can begin to be added. More marketing can be done and a proper beta product should be available. ( This step is expected to take 4-5 weeks)
50000K : At this point you will have a functional beta app. Proper marketing will have been put in place and can continue to help the growth of the app.
65000K : Goal reached! Should we be so lucky to reach our goal with your support, you will have a fully functioning app ready for use complete with chat options, powerful search optimization and more.

<h3>EFFE <i>Make Shopping a Game</i>
</h3>
<p>Hello, Everyone!<br/>I am Aurora and I am 19 years old<br/>I am a college student pursuing a Marketing Major<br/>I am from Italy, and I moved to the United States two years ago.<br/>I have always loved to invent and create new things, and this app is really important to me because it's a new challenge.<br/>I have had the idea this past summer, and from that moment I have been trying to figure out every day how to make this app a reality. <br/>Now I am at a point where I have a clear idea of what steps I need to take to realize the app, and this fundraising will allow me to start!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Why</h3>
<p>This fundraising is to raise 10.000$ to start the developing process. </p>
<p>With this money, we will be able to meet with an App Development Company to make a business model and a development plan, solve every technical problem and decide every detail of the game.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>App </h3>
<p>This app will allow people to find coupons and save money so that even who doesn't have extra money for shopping, can afford to buy clothes they love. </p>
<p>Moreover, this app will allow even smaller stores to have an efficient platform for hyperlocal marketing.</p>
<p>Finally, users will be able to exchange coupons with their friends, making this app a social platform where they can save money in a fun way. </p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The app is a Location-based Augmented Reality game. </p>
<p>In fact, the game will take place in the real world. </p>
<p>After Downloading the EFFE app, you will create an avatar that will follow your location on a virtual map.</p>
<p>While walking around your city, you will find Coupons for Fashion Brands you love.</p>
<p>It’s like playing a treasure hunt, where the playground is your city and the Treasures are Coupons.</p>
<p>(Imagine the game Pokemon Go, but instead of finding Pokemons, players will find Coupons)    </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Facts and Statistics</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Augmented Reality Market is expected to grow from $ 500 Million in 2016 to $ 5.7 billion in 2021” (Kevin Anderton, Forbes.)</li>
<li>63% of Millennials use Digital Coupons (Valassis.)</li>

EFFE Make Shopping a Game

Hello, Everyone!I am Aurora and I am 19 years oldI am a college student pursuing a Marketing MajorI am from Italy, and I moved to the United States two years ago.I have always loved to invent and create new things, and this app is really important to me because it's a new challenge.I have had the idea this past summer, and from that moment I have been trying to figure out every day how to make this app a reality. Now I am at a point where I have a clear idea of what steps I need to take to realize the app, and this fundraising will allow me to start!

What We Need & Why
This fundraising is to raise 10.000$ to start the developing process. 
With this money, we will be able to meet with an App Development Company to make a business model and a development plan, solve every technical problem and decide every detail of the game.

App 
This app will allow people to find coupons and save money so that even who doesn't have extra money for shopping, can afford to buy clothes they love. 
Moreover, this app will allow even smaller stores to have an efficient platform for hyperlocal marketing.
Finally, users will be able to exchange coupons with their friends, making this app a social platform where they can save money in a fun way. 
How it works
The app is a Location-based Augmented Reality game. 
In fact, the game will take place in the real world. 
After Downloading the EFFE app, you will create an avatar that will follow your location on a virtual map.
While walking around your city, you will find Coupons for Fashion Brands you love.
It’s like playing a treasure hunt, where the playground is your city and the Treasures are Coupons.
(Imagine the game Pokemon Go, but instead of finding Pokemons, players will find Coupons)    

Facts and Statistics

The Augmented Reality Market is expected to grow from $ 500 Million in 2016 to $ 5.7 billion in 2021” (Kevin Anderton, Forbes.)
63% of Millennials use Digital Coupons (Valassis.)

The store will also have a free section where users AND Market Gurus can share strategies, analysis, free signals/alerts etc. An important aspect of our store will be that anyone offering paid services will be reviewed and verified beforehand. Users will be able to rate and leave reviews on individual products, eventually creating a best-selling and top rated section for reference.

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>In 2013, the forblind.org community has decided to create cheap and useful devices that would help the visually impaired to navigate the world around them.</p>
<p>We found out that existing ultrasound cane tops were really expensive and inaccessible to most visually impaired people so we decided to make one that would be really cheap.</p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>Who We Are</b></h2>
<p>We are a nonprofit community called forblind.org. Our goal is to make the world a more accessible place for the visually impaired, to make their lives better using technology.</p>
<p>We want our technology to spread around the world as quickly as possible to make life better for as many visually impaired people as possible.</p>
<p>That's why all our developments are distributed on an open source and open hardware principle and we strive to make them very cheap.</p>
<p>We want the world and people who can create new technology to pay more attention to the visually impaired and their problems.</p>
<p>That's why we are crowdsourcing to create and develop technology. Anyone can join our community and help us reach our goals.</p>

by children and adolescents can be remedied. The <b>TimeOut</b> App offers a double
advantage: Leisure time and free time management by your children, but at the
same time under restrained control by parents.



</p><p>The fact that Internet time should be
limited for children is well known. In everyday life, this step becomes
increasingly difficult. If you do not constantly stand right next to your
children and repeatedly admonish them, you easily lose track of what relates to
the use of social networks and other online services. At the same time this
creates a conflict regarding the privacy of children and teenagers. With mom or
dad on one's back, one quickly feels patronized and controlled.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1167041/files/20150122081139-Fotolia_57845683_Subscription_Monthly_M.jpg?1421943099"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>
</p><p>The <b>TimeOut</b> App now allows you to remove
the scepter from your hand. And with a good feeling. No longer do you have to
keep an eye on the clock, as the app does it for you automatically. This leaves
time for other things, without fear of too much Internet use by your children.
And that leaves the children with sufficient freedom to divide the chosen time
independently. They enjoy new independence while learning to look out for
themselves and use their time more meaningfully. According to the motto: <b>""It's time to make our leisure time
into a free time again!""

</b><br/></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1167048/files/20150122081514-Fotolia_61365222_Subscription_Monthly_M.jpg?1421943314"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>This works very easily</b>. In the beginning,
the app automatically reads all applications that are installed on your
smartphone, tablet, iPod, iPad, notebook etc. Then you easily select from the
applications that you want to limit time with. Of course, you can completely
block the device after the allotted time or allow only certain calls or
applications thereafter. <b>Works on Windows, Mac, iOS and Android!

</b><br/></p><p>
</p><p>Depending on the age of the children and
teens, you determine a maximum length of use for them. This time is set in the
<b>TimeOut</b> App. When the app starts, it runs discreetly in the background and
works like a stopwatch. When the set time is reached, the app automatically
blocks the service you selected to be limited, be it Facebook, WhatsApp, games
or the Internet as a whole. If these services are not used, the clock does not
continue running. <b>A fair system!</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1167054/files/20150122081811-Fotolia_59510989_Subscription_Monthly_M.jpg?1421943491"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The <b>TimeOut App</b> adapts to your personal
needs and wishes. It is possible to enable time limited individual services,
applications or games, or even set length of use for individual days. Thus, for
example, on school days shorter Internet time can be set, with a little more
leeway given on weekends. Without stress and regular confiscation of the phone.
<b>It's completely automatic. Totally fair.</b></p>
<p>The <b>TimeOut</b> App can only be deleted after
installation with your master password, and all applications that will be
installed in the future can also only be downloaded after entering the master
password. <b>Kid´s can´t uninstall it!</b></p><p>
</p><p><b>The perfect solution</b> for controlled media
use by your children. The <b>TimeOut</b> App puts an end to the controversy about
""media use"" within your family. Age appropriate use of media on the
one hand, and the status symbol of youth on the other hand are easily
accommodated under one solution.<b> Limit the use of smartphones, tablets and
PCs for each of your children individually.</b>
<br/></p>

synchronized with each other!</b> If you have a fixed Internet usage period of two
hours daily, for example, the first hour can be on a notebook, then the
remaining hour can be on the phone. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1188503/files/20150201130223-sync2.jpg?1422824543"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Whether smartphone, tablet, iPod or
laptop, <b>all devices are synchronized with each other! </b>Your child must first
register with their name and personal password on each of their devices. Even
if your children share the devices, each of your children has their own personal
account, which they use to unlock each device. </p>
<p>The daily residual usage time is
synchronized at the start with the other devices. If your kids want to install new
applications or delete installed applications, this needs to be confirmed by
entering the master password. Parent's can allow such activity online
and while on the go via their Control Center. </p>

Benefit mutually from the hours saved.
Always being online is not necessary. Especially not if real life suffers and
mutates into ""off life."" Keeping work, media use and leisure time in

security in life, giving your child safety and support. Simultaneously, family
life is more relaxed, because if your child knows exactly when what and how
something is done, activities don't have to be re-negotiated every time.<br/><br/><p>

Children like rituals and always having the same
processes: getting up every morning at the same time; having a bedtime routine
in the evening. These things give them security, because they know what's
coming and because they can be prepared. Fixed habits in the family can create
a sense of belonging. And everyday life with children runs smoothly, because everything
that is recurrent and always done in the same way is easier for children to
accept. This creates clarity and relief in children and in parents; <b>you're helping your child more than you

</p><p>Dass die Internetzeit für Kinder begrenzt werden sollte, ist
allseits bekannt. Im Alltag gestaltet sich dieser Schritt aber zunehmend
schwierig. Wenn Sie nicht permanent neben Ihrem Nachwuchs stehen und diesen
wiederholt ermahnen möchten, verlieren Sie leicht den Überblick, was die

<p>Die <b>TimeOut</b> App ermöglicht Ihnen nun, das Zepter aus der
Hand zu geben. Und das mit einem guten Gefühl. Nicht mehr Sie müssen die Uhr im
Blick behalten, sondern die App erledigt das automatisch für Sie. So bleibt
Zeit für andere Dinge, ohne Angst um eine zu lange Internetnutzung des
Nachwuchses haben zu müssen. Und den Kindern bleibt ausreichend Freiraum, sich
die gewählte Zeit selbstständig einzuteilen. Sie genießen die neue
Unabhängigkeit und lernen gleichzeitig auf sich selbst zu achten und ihre Zeit
sinnvoll zu nutzen. Gemäß dem Motto: <b>""Es wird Zeit unsere Freizeit wieder zu einer freien
Zeit zu machen!""

</b><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1190927/files/20150202122441-Fotolia_61365222_Subscription_Monthly_M.jpg?1422908681"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Das Ganze funktioniert kinderleicht.</b> Zu Beginn liest die App
automatisch alle Anwendungen die auf dem Smartphone, Tablet, iPod, iPad,
Notebook etc. installiert sind aus. Sie wählen dann ganz einfach die
Anwendungen aus, die Sie gerne zeitlich begrenzen möchten. Natürlich können Sie
das Gerät nach Ablauf der Zeit komplett sperren lassen oder nur bestimmte
Anrufe oder Anwendungen zulassen. <b>Works on
Windows, Mac, IOS and Android!

</b></p><p>Dann legen Sie, je nach Alter der Kinder &amp; Jugendlichen,
eine maximale Nutzungsdauer für diese fest. Diese Zeit wird in der <b>TimeOut</b> App
eingestellt. Startet die App, läuft sie diskret im Hintergrund mit und
funktioniert dabei wie eine Stoppuhr. Ist die eingestellte Dauer erreicht,
sperrt die App automatisch den von Ihnen ausgewählten, zu begrenzenden Dienst:
sei es Facebook, WhatsApp, Spiele oder das Internet insgesamt. Werden diese
Dienste nicht benutzt, läuft die Uhr selbstverständlich auch nicht weiter. <b>Ein
faires System!</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1190933/files/20150202122729-Fotolia_59510989_Subscription_Monthly_M.jpg?1422908849"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Die <b>TimeOut </b>App passt sich Ihren persönlichen Anforderungen
und Wünschen an. Es ist möglich, einzelne Dienste, Anwendungen oder Spiele
zeitlich begrenzt freizugeben, oder auch verschiedene Nutzungsspannen für die
einzelnen Tage festzulegen. So lässt sich beispielsweise an Schultagen eine
kürzere Internetzeit festlegen und am Wochenende etwas mehr Spielraum geben.
Ohne Stress und ein regelmäßiges Einkassieren des Handys. <b>Ganz automatisch.
Ganz gerecht.</b></p>
<p>Die <b>TimeOut</b> App kann nach der Installation nur noch durch
das Masterpasswort von Ihnen gelöscht werden und alle Anwendungen die zukünftig
installiert werden, können auch nur nach Eingabe des Masterpasswortes
downgeloadet werden.<b> Kinder können TimeOut nicht einfach deinstallieren!</b>
</p><b></b><p><b>Die perfekte Lösung</b> für eine kontrollierte Mediennutzung
Ihrer Kinder. Die <b>TimeOut</b> App macht Schluss mit dem Streitthema
""Mediennutzung"" innerhalb Ihrer Familie. Altersentsprechende
Mediennutzung auf der einen, das Statussymbol der Jugend auf der anderen Seite

<p>Egal ob Smartphone, Tablet, iPod oder Laptop - <b>alle
Geräte werden untereinander synchronisiert!</b> Ihr Kind muss sich an jedem seiner
Geräte zunächst mit seinem Namen und seinem persönlichen Passwort anmelden.
Auch wenn Ihre Kinder die Geräte gemeinsam verwenden, jedes Ihrer Kinder hat
seinen eigenen, persönlichen Account mit dem es sich anmelden muss, um die
Geräte zu verwenden. </p>
<p>Die tägliche Rest-Nutzungszeit wird beim Start mit den
anderen Geräten abgeglichen. Möchten Ihre Kinder neue Anwendungen installieren oder
installierte Anwendungen löschen, muss dies durch die Eingabe des Eltern-Master-Passwortes
bestätigt werden. Diese Freigabe können Sie auch online und von unterwegs über
Ihr Control-Center erteilen. </p>
<p>Profitieren Sie gemeinsam von den eingesparten Stunden.
Always online muss nicht sein. Schon gar nicht, wenn das reale Leben darunter
leidet und zum „off life“ mutiert. Arbeit, Medienkonsum und Freizeit in einem

same time under restrained control by parents.



The fact that Internet time should be
limited for children is well known. In everyday life, this step becomes
increasingly difficult. If you do not constantly stand right next to your
children and repeatedly admonish them, you easily lose track of what relates to
the use of social networks and other online services. At the same time this
creates a conflict regarding the privacy of children and teenagers. With mom or
dad on one's back, one quickly feels patronized and controlled.

The TimeOut App now allows you to remove
the scepter from your hand. And with a good feeling. No longer do you have to
keep an eye on the clock, as the app does it for you automatically. This leaves
time for other things, without fear of too much Internet use by your children.
And that leaves the children with sufficient freedom to divide the chosen time
independently. They enjoy new independence while learning to look out for
themselves and use their time more meaningfully. According to the motto: ""It's time to make our leisure time
into a free time again!""



This works very easily. In the beginning,
the app automatically reads all applications that are installed on your
smartphone, tablet, iPod, iPad, notebook etc. Then you easily select from the
applications that you want to limit time with. Of course, you can completely
block the device after the allotted time or allow only certain calls or
applications thereafter. Works on Windows, Mac, iOS and Android!


Depending on the age of the children and
teens, you determine a maximum length of use for them. This time is set in the
TimeOut App. When the app starts, it runs discreetly in the background and
works like a stopwatch. When the set time is reached, the app automatically
blocks the service you selected to be limited, be it Facebook, WhatsApp, games
or the Internet as a whole. If these services are not used, the clock does not
continue running. A fair system!

The TimeOut App adapts to your personal
needs and wishes. It is possible to enable time limited individual services,
applications or games, or even set length of use for individual days. Thus, for
example, on school days shorter Internet time can be set, with a little more
leeway given on weekends. Without stress and regular confiscation of the phone.
It's completely automatic. Totally fair.
The TimeOut App can only be deleted after
installation with your master password, and all applications that will be
installed in the future can also only be downloaded after entering the master
password. Kid´s can´t uninstall it!
The perfect solution for controlled media
use by your children. The TimeOut App puts an end to the controversy about
""media use"" within your family. Age appropriate use of media on the
one hand, and the status symbol of youth on the other hand are easily
accommodated under one solution. Limit the use of smartphones, tablets and
PCs for each of your children individually.

In addition, the individual devices can be
synchronized with each other! If you have a fixed Internet usage period of two
hours daily, for example, the first hour can be on a notebook, then the
remaining hour can be on the phone. 
Whether smartphone, tablet, iPod or
laptop, all devices are synchronized with each other! Your child must first
register with their name and personal password on each of their devices. Even
if your children share the devices, each of your children has their own personal
account, which they use to unlock each device. 
The daily residual usage time is
synchronized at the start with the other devices. If your kids want to install new
applications or delete installed applications, this needs to be confirmed by
entering the master password. Parent's can allow such activity online
and while on the go via their Control Center. 

Benefit mutually from the hours saved.
Always being online is not necessary. Especially not if real life suffers and
mutates into ""off life."" Keeping work, media use and leisure time in
a healthy balance works quickly and easily with the TimeOut App. So everyone in
the family enjoys maximum freedom and privacy - and everyone gets plenty of
free time - work-life balance in perfection!

Use the app on all your devices!
The TimeOut App keeps track for you - and
allows you and your children more freedom for other things.
""It is not too little time we have,
but rather too much time that we do not use meaningfully."" Be responsible
and allow your children to have a safe and healthy future -  give your children free time!

Use TimeOut for a relaxed everyday
family life!
Step 1: Sign up on our website and
create an account for each of your children. From now on, you can individually
change the settings for each account by entering your email address and your
master password, without having to access the individual devices of your
children.

Step 2: Download the TimeOut App from
our website or from any of the app stores on each of the devices on which you
want to set a time limit.

Step 3: Simply assign each child's
device to their respective user account. 

Step 4: Next,
automatically scan all devices and thus all installed applications on each user
account. Now, click to select the applications on which you want to set a time
limit.Step 5: Then,
set the daily start and stop times, as well as the daily usage time for each
user account. Now start the TimeOut App.That´s all!: The
TimeOut App runs discreetly in the background and the usage time is shown on
the top right. Every 10 minutes, the current remaining time appears for five
seconds. During the last minute, the countdown is displayed flashing red until
the end!

TimeOut: Once the available daily time
has expired, all selected applications will be locked and cannot be used. The
non-locked applications can still be used.

Familiar processes provide reliability and
security in life, giving your child safety and support. Simultaneously, family
life is more relaxed, because if your child knows exactly when what and how
something is done, activities don't have to be re-negotiated every time.

Children like rituals and always having the same
processes: getting up every morning at the same time; having a bedtime routine
in the evening. These things give them security, because they know what's
coming and because they can be prepared. Fixed habits in the family can create
a sense of belonging. And everyday life with children runs smoothly, because everything
that is recurrent and always done in the same way is easier for children to
accept. This creates clarity and relief in children and in parents; you're helping your child more than you
think!Through your support we will TimeOut market worldwide! We have big plans - and this is just the beginning...Please Support us now - invest in the future - encourage the
healthy growth of your children! Die illegalen und sehr teuren ""Hacking Programme"" die am Markt angeboten werden, gleichen einer totalen
Überwachung (Dauertracking & Aufenthaltskontrolle, Nachrichtenbeobachtung, Prüfung
der eingehenden und ausgehenden Anrufe sowie Statistiken über das
Nutzungsverhalten)...""Big Brother is watching you!""Diese Programme widersprechen unserem Verständnis von
Vertrauen und Privatsphäre. Denn ein Anrecht auf Privatsphäre müssen auch
Kinder & Jugendliche haben!
TimeOut - ist ein Programm, das zwar die Nutzungsdauer, nicht
aber das persönlichste des Nachwuchses kontrolliert. TimeOut steht für eine
faire und sanfte Grenzsetzung. Und bringt den Kindern gleichzeitig mehr Freiraum
für andere Dinge im Leben.  Usability in
Perfektion!
Dem ewigen Streitthema um die Mediennutzung von Kindern und
Jugendlichen kann Abhilfe geschaffen werden. Die TimeOut App bietet Ihnen einen
doppelten Vorteil: Freizeit und freie Zeiteinteilung für Ihre Kinder unter
gleichzeitiger, aber zurückhaltender Kontrolle durch die Eltern.

Dass die Internetzeit für Kinder begrenzt werden sollte, ist
allseits bekannt. Im Alltag gestaltet sich dieser Schritt aber zunehmend
schwierig. Wenn Sie nicht permanent neben Ihrem Nachwuchs stehen und diesen
wiederholt ermahnen möchten, verlieren Sie leicht den Überblick, was die
Nutzung sozialer Netzwerke und anderer Online-Angebote betrifft. Gleichzeitig
entsteht ein Konflikt um die Privatsphäre der Kinder und Teenager. Mit Mama
oder Papa im Nacken fühlt man sich schnell bevormundet und kontrolliert.
Die TimeOut App ermöglicht Ihnen nun, das Zepter aus der
Hand zu geben. Und das mit einem guten Gefühl. Nicht mehr Sie müssen die Uhr im
Blick behalten, sondern die App erledigt das automatisch für Sie. So bleibt
Zeit für andere Dinge, ohne Angst um eine zu lange Internetnutzung des
Nachwuchses haben zu müssen. Und den Kindern bleibt ausreichend Freiraum, sich
die gewählte Zeit selbstständig einzuteilen. Sie genießen die neue
Unabhängigkeit und lernen gleichzeitig auf sich selbst zu achten und ihre Zeit
sinnvoll zu nutzen. Gemäß dem Motto: ""Es wird Zeit unsere Freizeit wieder zu einer freien
Zeit zu machen!""


Das Ganze funktioniert kinderleicht. Zu Beginn liest die App
automatisch alle Anwendungen die auf dem Smartphone, Tablet, iPod, iPad,
Notebook etc. installiert sind aus. Sie wählen dann ganz einfach die
Anwendungen aus, die Sie gerne zeitlich begrenzen möchten. Natürlich können Sie
das Gerät nach Ablauf der Zeit komplett sperren lassen oder nur bestimmte
Anrufe oder Anwendungen zulassen. Works on
Windows, Mac, IOS and Android!

Dann legen Sie, je nach Alter der Kinder & Jugendlichen,
eine maximale Nutzungsdauer für diese fest. Diese Zeit wird in der TimeOut App
eingestellt. Startet die App, läuft sie diskret im Hintergrund mit und
funktioniert dabei wie eine Stoppuhr. Ist die eingestellte Dauer erreicht,
sperrt die App automatisch den von Ihnen ausgewählten, zu begrenzenden Dienst:
sei es Facebook, WhatsApp, Spiele oder das Internet insgesamt. Werden diese
Dienste nicht benutzt, läuft die Uhr selbstverständlich auch nicht weiter. Ein
faires System!
Die TimeOut App passt sich Ihren persönlichen Anforderungen
und Wünschen an. Es ist möglich, einzelne Dienste, Anwendungen oder Spiele
zeitlich begrenzt freizugeben, oder auch verschiedene Nutzungsspannen für die
einzelnen Tage festzulegen. So lässt sich beispielsweise an Schultagen eine
kürzere Internetzeit festlegen und am Wochenende etwas mehr Spielraum geben.
Ohne Stress und ein regelmäßiges Einkassieren des Handys. Ganz automatisch.
Ganz gerecht.
Die TimeOut App kann nach der Installation nur noch durch
das Masterpasswort von Ihnen gelöscht werden und alle Anwendungen die zukünftig
installiert werden, können auch nur nach Eingabe des Masterpasswortes
downgeloadet werden. Kinder können TimeOut nicht einfach deinstallieren!
Die perfekte Lösung für eine kontrollierte Mediennutzung
Ihrer Kinder. Die TimeOut App macht Schluss mit dem Streitthema
""Mediennutzung"" innerhalb Ihrer Familie. Altersentsprechende
Mediennutzung auf der einen, das Statussymbol der Jugend auf der anderen Seite
werden problemlos unter einen Hut gebracht. Begrenzen Sie die Nutzung von Smartphone, Tablet und PC für
jedes Ihrer Kinder individuell.

Darüber
hinaus lassen sich die einzelnen Geräte untereinander synchronisieren! Wird bei
einer festgelegten Internet-Nutzungsdauer von zwei Stunden täglich
beispielsweise die erste Stunde am Notebook verbraucht, steht danach auch am
Handy nur noch eine Reststunde zur Verfügung.
Egal ob Smartphone, Tablet, iPod oder Laptop - alle
Geräte werden untereinander synchronisiert! Ihr Kind muss sich an jedem seiner
Geräte zunächst mit seinem Namen und seinem persönlichen Passwort anmelden.
Auch wenn Ihre Kinder die Geräte gemeinsam verwenden, jedes Ihrer Kinder hat
seinen eigenen, persönlichen Account mit dem es sich anmelden muss, um die
Geräte zu verwenden. 
Die tägliche Rest-Nutzungszeit wird beim Start mit den
anderen Geräten abgeglichen. Möchten Ihre Kinder neue Anwendungen installieren oder
installierte Anwendungen löschen, muss dies durch die Eingabe des Eltern-Master-Passwortes
bestätigt werden. Diese Freigabe können Sie auch online und von unterwegs über
Ihr Control-Center erteilen. 
Profitieren Sie gemeinsam von den eingesparten Stunden.
Always online muss nicht sein. Schon gar nicht, wenn das reale Leben darunter
leidet und zum „off life“ mutiert. Arbeit, Medienkonsum und Freizeit in einem
gesunden Gleichgewicht zu halten, funktioniert mit der TimeOut App schnell und
unkompliziert. So erhält sich jeder in der Familie maximalen Freiraum und
Privatsphäre - und alle gemeinsam bekommen reichlich time for free -
Work-Life-Balance in Perfektion!

Nutzen Sie die App auf jedem Ihrer Geräte!
Die TimeOut App behält für Sie den Überblick - und
ermöglicht Ihnen und Ihren Kindern mehr Freiraum für andere Dinge.
""Es ist nicht zu wenig Zeit, die wir haben, sondern es
ist zu viel Zeit, die wir nicht sinnvoll nutzen."" Zeigen Sie sich
Verantwortungsbewusst und ermöglichen Sie Ihren Kindern eine sichere und
gesunde Zukunft - schenken Sie Ihren Kindern freie Zeit!

Starten Sie mit TimeOut in einen entspannten
Familienalltag!
Schritt 1: Registrieren
Sie sich auf unserer Website und erstellen Sie ein Benutzerkonto für jedes Ihrer
Kinder. Zukünftig können Sie nach Eingabe Ihrer Email-Adresse und Ihres Eltern-Master-Passwortes
die Einstellungen für jedes Benutzerkonto separat ändern und anpassen, ohne auf
die einzelnen Geräte der Kinder zugreifen zu müssen.Schritt 2: Laden Sie die TimeOut App von unserer Website
oder aus einem der App-Stores auf jedes der Geräte herunter, die Sie zeitlich
begrenzen möchten.

Schritt 3: Ordnen Sie die einzelnen Geräte der Kinder ganz
einfach dem jeweiligen Benutzerkonto zu. Schritt 4: Im nächsten Schritt scannen Sie automatisch alle
Geräte und damit alle installierten Anwendungen des jeweiligen Benutzerkontos.
Wählen Sie nun per Mausklick die Anwendungen aus, die Sie zeitlich begrenzen
möchten.Schritt 5: Stellen Sie nun für jedes Benutzerkonto die tägliche
Start- und Endzeit sowie die täglich zur Verfügung stehende Nutzungszeit ein. Starten
Sie nun die TimeOut App.

Das ist alles: Die
TimeOut App läuft diskret im Hintergrund und die Nutzungszeit wird oben rechts
angezeigt. Alle 10 Minuten wird die aktuelle Rest-Zeit für fünf Sekunden
eingeblendet. Die letzte Minute wird bis zum Ablauf rot blinkend angezeigt!Zeit abgelaufen: Die täglich
zur Verfügung stehende Zeit ist abgelaufen, alle ausgewählten Anwendungen
werden gesperrt und können nicht weiter verwendet werden. Die nicht gesperrten
Anwendungen können weiterhin genutzt werden.
*TimeOut Bonus-Zeit - Bald erhältlich...*TimeOut für Spielkonsolen - Erscheint Anfang 2016Vertraute Abläufe vermitteln Verlässlichkeit und
Geborgenheit im Leben, geben Ihrem Kind Sicherheit und Halt. Gleichzeitig läuft
der Familienalltag entspannter, denn wenn Ihr Kind genau weiß, wann was wie
gemacht wird, muss nicht jedes Mal neu verhandelt werden.

Kinder mögen Rituale und immer gleiche Abläufe. Jeden
Morgen zur selben Zeit aufstehen, abends mit dem gleichen Ablauf ins Bett, das
vermittelt ihnen Geborgenheit, weil sie wissen, was kommt, und weil sie sich
darauf einstellen können. Feste Gewohnheiten in der Familie lassen ein
Wir-Gefühl entstehen. Und der Alltag mit Kindern läuft entspannter, denn alles,
was regelmäßig wiederkehrt und stets nach dem gleichen Schema abläuft,
akzeptieren Kinder leichter. Das schafft bei Kindern wie Eltern Klarheit und
Entlastung - Sie helfen Ihrem Kind mehr,
als Sie denken!Durch Ihre Unterstützung werden wir TimeOut weltweit vermarkten! Wir haben große Pläne - und dies ist erst der Anfang...Bitte Unterstützen Sie uns jetzt - investieren Sie in die Zukunft - fördern Sie das gesunde
Aufwachsen Ihrer Kinder!",66.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Calatin GmbH, who by the way borrowed its name from a celtic wizard, develops, trades and markets innovative technological products and solutions. </span>We envision a world where technology serves human needs. Today often the opposite is the case. As any organism relies on communication it is crucial to communicate. But there are messages you just want to keep private. This may be business information, ideas or just a private communication to a loved one.  Today privacy is very rare and must be protected were it is needed. </p>
<p>Towards this aim we are developing a messenger app (iOS and subsequently Android) that encodes messages sent between sender and receiver by applying a very simple but extremely efficient encoding/decoding algorithm: the book cypher. Book cyphers were used in history very successfully. Two identical books were used to encode and subsequently decode the message. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Only if the respective book is
known to the prying eye the code could be broken. Nowadays there are myriads of
book equivalents out there in the web: source codes of billion of websites.
These source codes are used by the book cypher messenger smartphone app and are
virtually unbreakable as long as the identity of the cypher key website is kept
secret. Take privacy in your own hands by communicating truly privately by
first selecting any website in the web, then inviting your counterpart to
accept the key and finally starting the private conversation. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have the
complete app plan at hands. We spent hundreds of hours to develop the app
outline and logics. As a next step we need a professional team to program the
app and the webserver environment. This is exactly why we are reaching out to
people like you, who alike us belief that privacy is a human right, to get this
important project funded.</span><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<p>
We calculated project
costs of $75'000. This includes: project management, translations, mobile app
programming, programming of the communication and cypher key intermediate
repository server, security testing, beta testing, publishing and app kick-off marketing. In return there will me a smartphone messenger available that allows private conversations that stay private as you take privacy in your own hands. </p>
<p>If funding is not fully reached we
would further follow up project funding efforts on a family and friends bases
and try to get minimal funds to obtain a functional proof of principle
prototype first and lastly a publishable app, which we would try to sell at a
higher price per download instead of providing it at a price as
low as 1$ as it is planned today.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> If we would still not be able to collect the founds needed, we would </span>invest the money into our parallel project applying similar same technology which is about save email encryption on PCs in order to provide email privacy.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>The book cypher messenger will
provide message privacy and thereby contribute to more personal freedom of
thought and expression. Who likes to have his most intimate messages exposed,
automatically screened or looked and laughed at by complete strangers? What
happens if maliscious minds prie into most confidendential business
conversations or private messages you write to your beloved ones? What is the
matter if they know your where abouts (location data is often transmitted along
with common messenger applications or exposed by the sender via non-/ or badly
decrypted messeging)? Well, burglars or people trying to break into your
property will feel encouraged as they know, you are not there. What if they
know that only your children are around..? What if the amazing idea you had and
you wanted to share <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">confidentially</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">with your best friend would be stolen by
industrial spies? What about someone reading your most intimate messages to your
spouse, husband or partner?</span></p>
<p>Do not wait until you are spied
upon but rather take the opportunity and support our project to bring a little
bit more freedom back to all of us. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;"">
<p>As with any IT project there may
be technological hurdles that may hard to overcome. In our case, as we have
performed due diligence evaluations of the project we are convinced that all
necessary technology and programming capabilities are readily at hand. There is
a risk for delays in reaching milestones due to the complexity of the project
and the number of project interfaces involved. Momentarily there are no

Calatin GmbH, who by the way borrowed its name from a celtic wizard, develops, trades and markets innovative technological products and solutions. We envision a world where technology serves human needs. Today often the opposite is the case. As any organism relies on communication it is crucial to communicate. But there are messages you just want to keep private. This may be business information, ideas or just a private communication to a loved one.  Today privacy is very rare and must be protected were it is needed. 
Towards this aim we are developing a messenger app (iOS and subsequently Android) that encodes messages sent between sender and receiver by applying a very simple but extremely efficient encoding/decoding algorithm: the book cypher. Book cyphers were used in history very successfully. Two identical books were used to encode and subsequently decode the message. Only if the respective book is
known to the prying eye the code could be broken. Nowadays there are myriads of
book equivalents out there in the web: source codes of billion of websites.
These source codes are used by the book cypher messenger smartphone app and are
virtually unbreakable as long as the identity of the cypher key website is kept
secret. Take privacy in your own hands by communicating truly privately by
first selecting any website in the web, then inviting your counterpart to
accept the key and finally starting the private conversation. 
We have the
complete app plan at hands. We spent hundreds of hours to develop the app
outline and logics. As a next step we need a professional team to program the
app and the webserver environment. This is exactly why we are reaching out to
people like you, who alike us belief that privacy is a human right, to get this
important project funded.   What We Need & What You Get


We calculated project
costs of $75'000. This includes: project management, translations, mobile app
programming, programming of the communication and cypher key intermediate
repository server, security testing, beta testing, publishing and app kick-off marketing. In return there will me a smartphone messenger available that allows private conversations that stay private as you take privacy in your own hands. 
If funding is not fully reached we
would further follow up project funding efforts on a family and friends bases
and try to get minimal funds to obtain a functional proof of principle
prototype first and lastly a publishable app, which we would try to sell at a
higher price per download instead of providing it at a price as
low as 1$ as it is planned today. If we would still not be able to collect the founds needed, we would invest the money into our parallel project applying similar same technology which is about save email encryption on PCs in order to provide email privacy. 

    The Impact 

The book cypher messenger will
provide message privacy and thereby contribute to more personal freedom of
thought and expression. Who likes to have his most intimate messages exposed,
automatically screened or looked and laughed at by complete strangers? What
happens if maliscious minds prie into most confidendential business
conversations or private messages you write to your beloved ones? What is the
matter if they know your where abouts (location data is often transmitted along
with common messenger applications or exposed by the sender via non-/ or badly
decrypted messeging)? Well, burglars or people trying to break into your
property will feel encouraged as they know, you are not there. What if they
know that only your children are around..? What if the amazing idea you had and
you wanted to share confidentially with your best friend would be stolen by
industrial spies? What about someone reading your most intimate messages to your
spouse, husband or partner?
Do not wait until you are spied
upon but rather take the opportunity and support our project to bring a little
bit more freedom back to all of us. 
    Risks & Challenges

As with any IT project there may
be technological hurdles that may hard to overcome. In our case, as we have
performed due diligence evaluations of the project we are convinced that all
necessary technology and programming capabilities are readily at hand. There is
a risk for delays in reaching milestones due to the complexity of the project
and the number of project interfaces involved. Momentarily there are no
significant delays expected. As we are a team of entrepreneurs with scientific
backgrounds and subsequent industrial careers we are used to finding solutions
where there had been none before.    Other Ways You Can Help

another than financial way or in addition to a sponsoring, please promote our
cause by suggesting it to friends. This will help us all regain our privacy and

<h2><strong>QI WIRELESS CHARGING CASE</strong></h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505197477/vjrmxjsldjkaqpje0xl0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>Reason to make</strong></h2>
<p>  SAMSUNG GALAXY S8 comes with QI wireless charging, but most people do not know the powerfulness and convenience of wireless charging. We want to show you G-CELL, a safety, fast and convenient battery case powered by QI.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505197651/gnad0c2tnlgu7wpdxskf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Phone battery expander</h2>
<p>  Within G-cell, up to 4400mAh of LG Li-Poly battery doubles the life of your phone. You don’t need to carry the heavy power bank, but still fully enjoy using your mobile phone.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505197754/i8tjpkermpxa5flpotw0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Efficiency</h2>
<p>Powered by the latest NexFET Power Block from Texas Instruments with innovative power management system, we improve the end-to-end efficiency of wireless charging to more than 87.9%*, and at the same time decrease heat releasing. Much lower temperature (**), enables us to pack the whole wireless charging system into the G-CELL.</p>
<p>*(Measured in laboratory environment with RIGOL DP823 Power Supply, Keysight U1273AX DMM, receiving unit is bq51025EVM-649)</p>
<p>**(Measured with Keysight 1186A Thermocouple Kit, Keysight 1273AX DMM, the surface temperature of MOSFET reach 42°C at worst circumstance, and 8°C more than surroundings temperature on the surface of product，which compare our old modules, which reach 92°C on surface of power MOSFET and 26°C more than surroundings temperature, all the tests are conducted at 24°C, using STM8S+AON MOSFET solution randomly got on market)</p>

<h2>Smart Power Path</h2>
<p>  When you plug the type-C cable into G-cell, it will charge your phone first. After the phone has been fully charged, it will start charging itself. With Smart Power Path, it will automatically adjust the current flow through the wireless transmitting modules and battery, providing excellent charging experience with safety</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505197981/cpndl3hjkfsnmk7s00vv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Safety</h2>
<p>  With 5 temperature sensors on board through all stage of running, G-CELL prevents critical components from over heat, ensuring durable and safe. To further strengthen the idea of build product with quality, all parts are sourced from certified distributors of top brand suppliers, such as TDK, Murata, Texas Instrument and STMicroelectronics</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505198089/h45awohqgpj2pv6collw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Exterior and Protection</h2>
<p>  Taking human engineering and aesthetics into consideration, polycarbonate case enhanced by adding more than 30% of fiberglass, strengthen the structure to a new level - while protecting your phone, it also providing light weight and durability. Through the process of “mobile printing – cutting &amp; molding – pressing”, we can make a perfect combination of art and technology, creating the perfect color that lasting long.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>With the efforts given by our powerful hardware and mechanical group, G-CELL is almost finished.</p>
<p>The leader of Hardware team has worked at Shenzhen for more than 4 years and built strong connections with local industry chain.

</div></div>","QI WIRELESS CHARGING CASE

Reason to make
  SAMSUNG GALAXY S8 comes with QI wireless charging, but most people do not know the powerfulness and convenience of wireless charging. We want to show you G-CELL, a safety, fast and convenient battery case powered by QI.

 
Phone battery expander
  Within G-cell, up to 4400mAh of LG Li-Poly battery doubles the life of your phone. You don’t need to carry the heavy power bank, but still fully enjoy using your mobile phone.

Efficiency
Powered by the latest NexFET Power Block from Texas Instruments with innovative power management system, we improve the end-to-end efficiency of wireless charging to more than 87.9%*, and at the same time decrease heat releasing. Much lower temperature (**), enables us to pack the whole wireless charging system into the G-CELL.
*(Measured in laboratory environment with RIGOL DP823 Power Supply, Keysight U1273AX DMM, receiving unit is bq51025EVM-649)
**(Measured with Keysight 1186A Thermocouple Kit, Keysight 1273AX DMM, the surface temperature of MOSFET reach 42°C at worst circumstance, and 8°C more than surroundings temperature on the surface of product，which compare our old modules, which reach 92°C on surface of power MOSFET and 26°C more than surroundings temperature, all the tests are conducted at 24°C, using STM8S+AON MOSFET solution randomly got on market)

Smart Power Path
  When you plug the type-C cable into G-cell, it will charge your phone first. After the phone has been fully charged, it will start charging itself. With Smart Power Path, it will automatically adjust the current flow through the wireless transmitting modules and battery, providing excellent charging experience with safety

Safety
  With 5 temperature sensors on board through all stage of running, G-CELL prevents critical components from over heat, ensuring durable and safe. To further strengthen the idea of build product with quality, all parts are sourced from certified distributors of top brand suppliers, such as TDK, Murata, Texas Instrument and STMicroelectronics

Exterior and Protection
  Taking human engineering and aesthetics into consideration, polycarbonate case enhanced by adding more than 30% of fiberglass, strengthen the structure to a new level - while protecting your phone, it also providing light weight and durability. Through the process of “mobile printing – cutting & molding – pressing”, we can make a perfect combination of art and technology, creating the perfect color that lasting long.
 
RISKS & CHALLENGES
With the efforts given by our powerful hardware and mechanical group, G-CELL is almost finished.
The leader of Hardware team has worked at Shenzhen for more than 4 years and built strong connections with local industry chain. We pick the suppliers we trust, preventing any fake, refurbished components from entering our products, maximumly ensuring the product’s safety. With industrial products background, we think we can achieve our goal of safety and durability.

Our hardware teaming is focusing on getting G-CELL certified around the world, including RoHS, FCC, CE, CCC, UL and QI. Pre-manufacture is already done, and send the sample for further testing.

<h3><b>How it Works</b></h3>
<p>It has never been so easy to develop software applications.</p>
<p>The functionality of your software will come from the ""<b>Blox</b>"". They can each handle a single task. By adding and connecting them together, you can make the application <strong>you want.</strong></p>
<p>The<strong> ""Blox""</strong> come in all shapes and sizes. Some are inputs, such as webcam, video file, audio input. Others can act as a filter such as changing colors on a video stream or equalizing audio. <b>LiveBlox</b> contains elements for computer vision, which gives you the power to detect objects, faces, people, movement and colors and act on that input.</p>
<p><strong>LiveBlox</strong> makes it simple to build your own software applications, by following a simple <strong>4 step approach</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drop the <b>Blox </b>you want into the editor</li>
<li>Connect them together</li>
<li>Build your own <b>Graphic User Interface (GUI)</b>
</li>
<li>Export and run<br/>

raise through this campaign will help us beef up our staff so that we can do this and purchase 
additional equipment. It will also help us devote more time and effort to the testing stages of our
software before we can make it commercially available.

Visionaries like you can contribute to the development of LiveBlox in many ways. We have prepared an exciting rewards program that truly values your contribution.

The Impact
 Our business is located in one of Southeast Asia's booming metropolises, with a pool of fresh and dynamic
talent. Cambodia has treated us well , so we want to give something back to this country by providing jobs for the local talent. So, by funding our campaign, you don't just help Apulus build its software, but you also enable us to support our community here in Siem Reap by generating much needed jobs. We need a team of dynamic software engineers, and sourcing talent locally, providing them with first class training, and the experience to
pursue a career as software engineers is part of our strategy as a socially responsible business.

Risks & Challenges
 Our group is comprised of amazingly talented individuals with experience in management and software
development, yet, like any startup, we are faced with the challenge of financing the continuing development of its
products. We aim to use IndieGoGo as a tool to help us to address this challenge. We know that good people like to support the 'little man'; we may be small, but only for now! Your contribution will help us develop into a company that offers innovative
superior products, generates jobs for our communities, and continues to be responsive to the ever
changing demands of our customers. 
We aim to release early September.     
Other Ways You Can Help
 Your financial contributions are important, you can help us generate awareness about our Indiegogo campaign by doing the following:

Share, Repost, Retweet - Help us gain more followers on our social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Help us get the word out.


Organize a LiveBlox Demo and Fundraiser Barbecue - while our team cannot be personally with you, we can send you tools and resources to introduce LiveBlox to your friends, and help us raise funds. We can give your group a perk if you raise at least US$ 100.00 for our campaign! Don't forget to get a Groupfie and post in on social media with the hashtag #LiveBloxonindiegogo.

DistriRead originated from the company iRex that developed one of the first E-Ink e-readers many years ago. Since 2008 DistriRead is active in the e-reader market and in 2010 the Icarus brand was founded. Icarus products are sold worldwide by a network of distributors and major retailers and e-tailers like Mediamarkt, Fnac, Expert, Coolblue, Paradigit, Vobis, Bol.com, Amazon to name a few. </p>
<p>The Icarus team is composed of a mix of people with a combined experience in the consumer electronics industry of more than 20 years.</p>
<p>DistriRead is located in the city of Eindhoven, the tech capital of the Netherlands.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><b>Q:</b> Why would I not just read on my phone or tablet?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> For casual reading on the go you could use a phone or tablet. But only E-Ink devices offer you a comfortable reading experience if you are reading for longer periods as the screen does not lead to eye fatigue. Also if you want to read outside on a LCD screen this is very difficult due to the reflections. If you are serious about reading, the best device to do so on is an e-reader.</p>

<p><b>Q: </b>How can I read Kindle books on the Illumina?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> For reading Kindle books on the Icarus e-reader, simply run the Kindle App. This will allow you to access your existing library and to read those books.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: </b>I see the Illumina on sale on other places on the web. Does that version also include the Google Play Store?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> No, this Indiegogo campaign page is the only place where you can purchase this edition with Google Play at the moment. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Q: </b>How can I read Kobo books on the Illumina?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> For reading Kobo books on the Icarus e-reader, simply run the Kobo App. This will allow you to access your existing library and to read those books.</p>
<br/><p><b>Q: </b>How can I use apps like Skoobe so I can read unlimited books at a monthly fee?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Simply install the Skoobe app on the Illumina. Like any app, simply open the Google Play Store, search for the app and press Install. It is that easy!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: </b>Will all apps work on my e-reader?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Not all apps will run on the Illumina. Apps that were designed for a newer Android version (the Illumina runs 4.2.2) might not work. Additionally apps are generally designed for use on LCD screens in mind. They might behave differently on an E-Ink screen. Apps that were designed for reading (ebooks, news, RSS etc.) in general work really well on our e-readers. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Do you ship to my country too?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> We ship our e-readers worldwide via Fedex and DPD. Shipping charges do apply.</p>
<p>Shipping to Europe: $ 7. Shipping to US and Canada: $15, Shipping to Rest of the World: $25. Custom duties might apply.</p>

Keeping apps up to date is now also a breeze. The E-Ink Carta screen displays text crisply and with high contrast (212 DPI).The Illumina is compact, lightweight and comfortable to hold, It includes physical page turning buttons that offer 'one hand reading' and a screen refresh button, which is very helpful with certain apps that are not optimized for E-Ink screens.The integrated front light enables comfortable reading even in low light situations and of course the Illumina has a touchscreen, Wi-Fi and plenty of storage for your books (8Gb).What makes the Illumina truly unique, it its compatibility with all e-book platforms. From e-book web shops to all-you-can-read subscriptions, from public libraries to public domain books and more. Note: this product is not yet on sales via our website or web shops. The Illumina E653BK that you find elsewhere does not contain the Google Play Store. The product in this campaign is the E653BK-GP.Out-of-the box our Illumina e-reader - running on Android 4.2 - can run apps from all reading platforms, such as Scribd, Skoobe, Kindle, Kobo, Mofibo, Bliyoo and many more. Public libraries have Android reading apps to, so with our e-readers you can also lend books at your library. If you own a library of books of a closed ecosystem already (for instance Kindle) you can easily access it on the Illumina using the Kindle app. By using cloud storage apps like Dropbox (pre-installed) or others, you can access your library stored in the cloud.Via the Google Play Store you have access to thousands of apps.Below you find some screenshots of apps running on the Illumina :The Illumina is also future proof: as Android is the dominant mobile device operating system you can rest assured that any future reading app will be available on Android.The Illumina at work (video)This video shows Play Store at work on the Illumina.

FAQ
Q: Why would I not just read on my phone or tablet?
A: For casual reading on the go you could use a phone or tablet. But only E-Ink devices offer you a comfortable reading experience if you are reading for longer periods as the screen does not lead to eye fatigue. Also if you want to read outside on a LCD screen this is very difficult due to the reflections. If you are serious about reading, the best device to do so on is an e-reader.

Q: How can I read Kindle books on the Illumina?
A: For reading Kindle books on the Icarus e-reader, simply run the Kindle App. This will allow you to access your existing library and to read those books.


Q: I see the Illumina on sale on other places on the web. Does that version also include the Google Play Store?
A: No, this Indiegogo campaign page is the only place where you can purchase this edition with Google Play at the moment. 

Q: How can I read Kobo books on the Illumina?
A: For reading Kobo books on the Icarus e-reader, simply run the Kobo App. This will allow you to access your existing library and to read those books.
Q: How can I use apps like Skoobe so I can read unlimited books at a monthly fee?
A: Simply install the Skoobe app on the Illumina. Like any app, simply open the Google Play Store, search for the app and press Install. It is that easy!


Q: Will all apps work on my e-reader?
A: Not all apps will run on the Illumina. Apps that were designed for a newer Android version (the Illumina runs 4.2.2) might not work. Additionally apps are generally designed for use on LCD screens in mind. They might behave differently on an E-Ink screen. Apps that were designed for reading (ebooks, news, RSS etc.) in general work really well on our e-readers. 

Q: Do you ship to my country too?
A: We ship our e-readers worldwide via Fedex and DPD. Shipping charges do apply.
Shipping to Europe: $ 7. Shipping to US and Canada: $15, Shipping to Rest of the World: $25. Custom duties might apply.",12.0,1,"4 Campaigns

<p>We invented a <strong>Modular Smartphone Case</strong> that is affordable and features lots of new <strong>Functions</strong>. The Case stores the <strong>Modules</strong> and has <strong>four Holes</strong> to quickly remove everything. We provided Flipmaster3000 with a <strong>holding Mechanism</strong> allowing you to use some Modules like the Gamepad or the Keyboard <strong>on the go</strong>. The holding Mechanism is<strong> semi-elastic</strong> for an easy flip around of the Case. You can also adjust the<strong> holding Angle</strong> by pulling the knots up or down. After flipping the Case around you can <strong>place it upright</strong>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Flipmaster 3000 is available for <strong>every Smartphone</strong>, either <strong>Android</strong>, <strong>iOS</strong> or another OS. Most of the modules work with <strong>Bluetooth Low Energy</strong>, so they are compatible with any device that has Bluetooth Low Energy. You can check that by downloading the free App BLE Checker for Android. All of the iPhones since the 4S have got Bluetooth Low Energy. Please consider that some features, such as programmable buttons, won't work on iOS. The module side of the case will be adapted to the size of your smartphone for a perfect fit. For very big phones or phablets it might be that the case will have another module slot depending on the overall space.</p>

We invented a Modular Smartphone Case that is affordable and features lots of new Functions. The Case stores the Modules and has four Holes to quickly remove everything. We provided Flipmaster3000 with a holding Mechanism allowing you to use some Modules like the Gamepad or the Keyboard on the go. The holding Mechanism is semi-elastic for an easy flip around of the Case. You can also adjust the holding Angle by pulling the knots up or down. After flipping the Case around you can place it upright.
 

 
The Modules are flexibly combinable insinde the Case and stick to it due to Nano Suction Pads.   
 

 
Compatibility

 

 
Flipmaster 3000 is available for every Smartphone, either Android, iOS or another OS. Most of the modules work with Bluetooth Low Energy, so they are compatible with any device that has Bluetooth Low Energy. You can check that by downloading the free App BLE Checker for Android. All of the iPhones since the 4S have got Bluetooth Low Energy. Please consider that some features, such as programmable buttons, won't work on iOS. The module side of the case will be adapted to the size of your smartphone for a perfect fit. For very big phones or phablets it might be that the case will have another module slot depending on the overall space.

<p>For those of you meeting me for the first time, my name is Pippa, and this is the third year of my partnership with Susan G. Komen. With the support of my team, Dale Coyne Racing, my helmet, suit and racing car will feature the Komen logos and marks at this year's Indianapolis 500. We pair our on-car partnership with this campaign, raising funds for breast cancer care and research. This is our second year on Indiegogo, and for the 100th Running of the Indianapolis 500 this year, we have an ambitious goal.</p>

<p>All of the profits from this campaign are donated on to Susan G. Komen, none of the money raised here goes to the racing program.

<h4 style=""color: #F772A6;"">Q. What happens if you don't make your goal? </h4>
<p>This is a ""Flexible Funding"" campaign, just like in 2015, so even if we don't reach out ultimate goal, we are still able to donate all of the profits from the campaign onto Susan G. Komen. However, if we don't make our goal, we have to pay higher fees, so less money gets donated on.</p>
<h4 style=""color: #F772A6;"">Q. Can I get a tax receipt from this campaign?</h4>
<p></p>
<p>No. This campaign is being run by me (Pippa Mann) to benefit Komen as part of our partnership. By running the campaign myself, and with my team, I am able to offer perks and rewards for people who get involved, and I am able to absorb those hard costs per the answer to question one. So, once the funds raised through this site are donated to Komen post-campaign, there are no further costs at all associated with that donation. The one downside to this system is that my business is not a nonprofit; therefore, we can't issue tax receipts.</p>

</div></div>","A Pink Racing Campaign For A Cause





For those of you meeting me for the first time, my name is Pippa, and this is the third year of my partnership with Susan G. Komen. With the support of my team, Dale Coyne Racing, my helmet, suit and racing car will feature the Komen logos and marks at this year's Indianapolis 500. We pair our on-car partnership with this campaign, raising funds for breast cancer care and research. This is our second year on Indiegogo, and for the 100th Running of the Indianapolis 500 this year, we have an ambitious goal.






$100,000 At The 100th Running

Despite all the advances in research did you know that 1 in 8 women in the US will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime?



$100,000 could fund over 750 screening mammograms for underinsured and uninsured women, or go to help over 7000 individuals navigate their way through the breast cancer care path.

$100,000 could fund 2 years of support stipend for a graduate student studying disparities in breast cancer outcomes.

$100,000 could fund 1 month of support for the Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium which conduct innovative and high-impact trails for breast cancer.


We admit that we're going to be promoting a lot of pink over the course of this campaign, but this goes so much deeper than a color. The money we raise through this campaign will help save lives.Photo from Susan G. Komen Central Indiana Race for the Cure 2015.
Our Goal

We know the goal we've set ourselves is scary, but let's break it down. 

We're looking for 1000 people to get involved for $100. 
You could purchase a signed Bell mini-helmet, a signed print of our 2016 car by artist Doug Garrison, or you could put the name of a loved one in the cockpit of my race car. You could get your whole family involved in the campaign through our family pack, you could sign the biggest young Pippa fan you know up for our Ultimate Youth Supporter Pack, or you could go for the pink signed 100th Running cap and pink 100th Running koozie from IMS.



Or we're looking for 2000 people to get involved at $50. 
You could come and race me in a go kart at Fastimes, or choose a signed pink or charcoal Pippa cap. You could help us power towards a cure with our custom campaign power bank to charge your phone, sign up someone young in your family for the Youth Supporter Pack (including the mini 1:64 Pippa themed diecast car), decide to go for one of our 2016 campaign posters, or a Pippa water bottle.



You can start out by becoming a supporter for as little as $20, or you could spend big and take home my race worn gloves or fire suit. The choice is yours.
And if $20 to get involved is still too steep, you can still help us reach our goal. We need you to tell your friends, share our campaign on social media, and get involved to help us find the supporters who will help our total climb!


The Perks

This year we are bundling our perks together to create a ""Supporter Pack,"" and then almost every perk you see builds from there.




Our Supporter Pack includes a custom Pippa helmet pin, only available via the campaign, a Komen wristband, a BREVAGenplus mini stylus/penlight, a signed autograph card, a 1 year free membership to Travel for the Cause, and a 25% off one-time use coupon for Pippa's store that will be emailed out in the days following your contribution. Our first 100 campaign contributors will also receive a pink Komen Koozie along with their selected perk.

As we did in 2015, we will be sending as many items out as possible as the campaign goes on. Please take photos of your Perks as they arrive, and share them with us on social media!

Campaign PostersOur campaign posters were a big hit in 2015, but they ended up joining our campaign fairly late in the game. We had a lot of requests months and months after the campaign as to where people could find them... For 2016 we are launching our posters as a Perk right at the start of the campaign. 


We are asking for your help in sharing our poster image from the campaign gallery with the internet at large, so people know we have them, and they are available for purchase only here, and only through May 29! Posters will once again be printed following the race, and Pippa will sign them before they are sent out.



Race With Pippa NightRace with Pippa Night is back for it's second year as part of the Get Involved Campaign, but this time, we've switched things up!




Every racer gets one practice session AND one heat on the night of the event. This means things will move more quickly, and everyone will get more track time. It also means that when you're not on track, Pippa will have more time to hang out, and spend more quality time with all of our guests.


The fastest 7 times will set the field for the Championship Race. Pippa will join these drivers on track for the Big Race of the night.


Every racer has the opportunity to bring 1 non-racing guest to the event. Within 24-48 hours of selecting this perk you will receive an email from our campaign allowing you to access a ""Secret Perk"" to sign up your guest for $1. 


For the first time, Fastimes also has 2-seater karts. There are four, 4 minute rides with Pippa in the 2-seater kart that also available as a Race With Pippa Night Perk. Every rider may bring a guest with no guest sign-up needed.



* All racers must be over 18 years old, however we can accept 2-seater riders under 18 who are over 42"" tall and accompanied by a parent to sign the Fastimes waivers. Rides for those under 18 will be in one of the slower 2-seater karts with a Governor active that restricts speed. 
*  If you wish to bring a non racing guest to meet Pippa, enjoy the food and beverages, and take part in the end of night raffle, please look for an email from our campaign offering you that option for $1 extra 24-48 hours after you select this perk. 






Turn The Cockpit PinkOur favorite and most personal perk from 2015 returns. If you select this perk, please watch your email inbox for an email from pippawebteam@gmail.com to collect your name. If you have not seen an email within 48 hours, please reach out to the same email address.












The final day for this perk will be May 22nd. On midnight after qualifying ends at the Indianapolis 500, we will close this perk, collect any final names, and all names will go to the printers. The names will go in the car on Carb Day, Friday, May 27th.


Photos will be uploaded to social media as the names go in the cockpit. After the Indianapolis 500 they will all be uploaded to the campaign gallery here, and to Pippa's Flickr. Once we have uploaded the photos to the campaign we will post a campaign update to let all our contributors know they can now view these photos. We will follow this with an email containing the direct Flickr gallery link to everyone who selected this perk and placed a name in the cockpit.


Last year we had a lot of requests for this perk after it was closed. Due to the time constraints of having to get the names printed and into the cockpit, we were unable to accept many contributions and names in 2015. If you know someone who was interested in this last year, or who might be interested this year, please help us share this perk using our 2015 pink cockpit images that are in the campaign gallery so that we can honor as many people as possible in 2016.




* Name position and visibility of a specific name in the cockpit will be random, and unfortunately we cannot take requests to place any name in a specific location. Everyone is treated equally, but given the confines of the space, it will be tougher to spot some names than others.





Doug Garrison PrintsOne of our biggest fundraising items of 2015 is back for 2016 through the generosity of artist Doug Garrison, who has created a new piece of artwork featuring Pippa's car at the 100th Running of the Indianapolis 500.

As Doug's artwork progresses photos will be shared here in the campaign gallery and on social media. * Shipping costs for the prints include the cost of printing the 100 prints, cost of shipping the print to Indianapolis to Pippa for her to sign, and cost of shipping the signed print on to you. This means shipping costs for this perk are higher than normal, so please check them before you commit to purchasing.


Pippa's Race Worn Suit
As in 2015, Pippa's race-worn suit will be available as a one-of-a-kind perk through this campaign. Post-race, Pippa's suit will be laundered, and then she will sign it before we send it on to you. We will also reach out to you via email and find out whether you would like to receive our Supporter Pack.
* Please note: You will be receiving the race-worn item from the 100th Running of the Indianapolis 500, and it will have the belt/wear marks from being worn. However the suit will be laundered before it is signed and sent out.  



    FAQs Q. Does the money you raise go to fund the racing program, or go to Komen?
All of the profits from this campaign are donated on to Susan G. Komen, none of the money raised here goes to the racing program. There are some hard costs associated with some of the perks, and Indiegogo does charge us fees for being here, but after those costs, everything else gets donated on.

No. This campaign is being run by me (Pippa Mann) to benefit Komen as part of our partnership. By running the campaign myself, and with my team, I am able to offer perks and rewards for people who get involved, and I am able to absorb those hard costs per the answer to question one. So, once the funds raised through this site are donated to Komen post-campaign, there are no further costs at all associated with that donation. The one downside to this system is that my business is not a nonprofit; therefore, we can't issue tax receipts.

<p><b>Explaining Pathways to everyone...</b></p>
<p><b>Imagine you are searching on the internet and a system could tell you if a friend or colleague of yours has searched for the same thing before and then show you the ""path"" of sites they visited before finding what they were looking for. At that point, our system will not only serve as a way to compare the two paths, but also as a way of modifying them, for example, by adding or deleting a site that was more or less useful, respectively. Now all of your other friends will see the work you did on that search query and can also give their suggestions by editing the ""path"" with the additions that the network will then judge as more or less valid. The system thus creates a continuously updated database that increases the speed and the quality of what we look for on the web.</b></p>
<p><b>That’s Pathways - a worthwhile project for everyone!</b></p>

<p>Today, many people perform the same searches on the Internet, but the

<p><b>Our solution</b></p>
<p>The project allows anyone to share their ""trail"" of results of a

population.</p>
<p><b>Product</b></p>
<p>Pathways is a collaborative project that targets anyone who uses digital
technology, from students to professionals, from companies to universities.</p>
<p>The product will consist of a online editor (like Google Docs) that allows
you to keep track of the sites explored by generating a set of logically
related sites which represent the path followed to get to a certain point.
 This is done using Pathway’s own algorithm.</p>
<p>Pathways will be free <b>for all users</b>. Our revenues will come
from three streams:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>For Companies, Business and Professional: an Analytics Profile systems and
a solution to help productivity</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>For Business and Consumer: a mobile app.</p>
<p>To understand what we mean by the <b>Analytics
system</b>, imagine a situation where a Company or a freelancer wants to know
if their online communication strategy is producing the results they expected in
terms of messaging and feedback on the web.</p>
<p>For example, if a company is preparing an event to launch a product, and users,
researching on the internet, associate that product with something incorrect,
there is a problem to be resolved. This is the value of Pathways, namely the
ability, via notifications, to understand if you are going in the right
direction and in which contexts the company's product was searched for, thus
allowing you to review your strategies and improve the quality of what you are
offering.</p>
<p>In addition, we also offer a <b>solution
to improve productivity on online search, </b>that allows employees to see if
someone has opened an ""online path"" on the same topic and to benefit
from it in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, once the Pathways research database has grown, an <b>app</b> will be introduced in on-demand

Help Us Grow!


""United we stand, divided we fall"" 


WOW 20% Funded!!
Each cent is a brick to build our dream. And our dream is a real sustain to everyone work.


Explaining Pathways to everyone...
Imagine you are searching on the internet and a system could tell you if a friend or colleague of yours has searched for the same thing before and then show you the ""path"" of sites they visited before finding what they were looking for. At that point, our system will not only serve as a way to compare the two paths, but also as a way of modifying them, for example, by adding or deleting a site that was more or less useful, respectively. Now all of your other friends will see the work you did on that search query and can also give their suggestions by editing the ""path"" with the additions that the network will then judge as more or less valid. The system thus creates a continuously updated database that increases the speed and the quality of what we look for on the web.
That’s Pathways - a worthwhile project for everyone!






 

How many
times each day do you search on the internet? Imagine if one day, with just a
few simple clicks, you could see what other people who did the same search as
you had found - even seeing the path that led them to that result.
Imagine
if you could also improve this path by modifying or updating it, constantly
adding more suitable and up-to-date web-sites.
This
will be possible thanks to this campaign. In fact, we can create a public
database of internet search paths that will save time and improve users
productivity.







We have been working successfully in the field of technological innovation
since 1997.
We are programmers, marketing experts, philosophers, and fantastic,
carefree and zealous workers, all togheter focused towards creating PathWays.
We are not asking you for a
simple donation, but rather for the chance to kick start a project that will
become useful for everyone. Every penny raised will be fully invested into
creating a beta version of the project.


 

It all started with one crazy dream: to create something that can become
useful to the entire online community. We have already invested time, sleepless
nights and money. Now we need you.







For us, every single penny is a line of code, and each line of code is a
step towards the impossible.
Each donation will put us towards completing Pathways so we can succeed in
providing our supporters and the rest of the world a more productive and
efficient way to connect the internet. In return for your support, we promise
to keep you up to date on our progress and important developments throughout
each stage of the creation of PathWays.
If we don't be able to reach our funding goal, we will create a simple MVP
(Minimum Viable Product) that we can showcase to a business incubator or
possible investor.
Your money will not be wasted.
   
 

If we succeed, the impact will be incredible for the technological world.
We want to create a product that isn't a direct competitor to search engines,
but rather uses their services. Each time you search for something on the net,
you will instinctively come to use PathWays to see if someone has previously
found something better.
Some members of our team have already achieved a number of successes: we
have patent agreements with major companies and have been awarded funds to
develop software for online children protection - but PathWays is an even more
ambitious project.
The market needs a product like ours to constantly improve the quality of
internet searches and to reduce ""wasted"" time.




A Problem worth solving
Today, many people perform the same searches on the Internet, but the

different. This is a problem in terms of lost time and quality of information.
Our solution
The project allows anyone to share their ""trail"" of results of a
web search and, through an editor, allows others users to explore it, complete
it and change it for the benefit of their social network or across the Internet
population.
Product
Pathways is a collaborative project that targets anyone who uses digital
technology, from students to professionals, from companies to universities.
The product will consist of a online editor (like Google Docs) that allows
you to keep track of the sites explored by generating a set of logically
related sites which represent the path followed to get to a certain point.
 This is done using Pathway’s own algorithm.
Pathways will be free for all users. Our revenues will come
from three streams:
· 
For Companies, Business and Professional: an Analytics Profile systems and
a solution to help productivity
· 
For Business and Consumer: a mobile app.
To understand what we mean by the Analytics
system, imagine a situation where a Company or a freelancer wants to know

</p><p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>Do you use a manual wheelchair? Ever feel the need to travel farther or faster?    Pop n Drop might be just what you need! <br/></p><p>My name is Sergio, inventor of the
Pop n Drop. The Pop n Drop was developed out of necessity. Since experiencing a
debilitating spinal cord injury many years ago, I have been using a manually
propelled wheelchair to get around. I always resisted 'moving up' to a power wheelchair
because as long as I am capable of pushing a manual chair, I don't want to use a
power chair.  Well, fast forward more than 25 years, and I find that I
can't push the long distances I used to. I have actually damaged my shoulders
several times going on long wheelchair pushes. I needed to find a way that I
could continue using my manual chair 80% of the time, but occasionally get a
motorized boost when I needed to go a longer distance.</p>
<p>So, with my manual wheelchair, an
electric scooter and motivated by the need for speed, I got to work. My initial trial used
bungee cords and zip ties to connect the wheelchair to the scooter. Needless to
say, that first trial was not too successful, but I learned something important! There is
enough power in the scooter to propel a wheelchair (and I better wear a helmet)!
In fact, every trial taught me something new. Now, after almost a
year of development and 10 prototypes, Pop n Drop is ready to
benefit others too. Pop n Drop has exceeded all expectations! 
It's easy to hook up (with some practice) and soooo fun to use!</p>
<p>I’m excited to be sharing the benefits (and the fun!) of Pop n Drop and I
 am ready to do a first production run of 50 units.  For a contribution 
of $175, you will receive a Pop n Drop made to the size of your 
wheelchair. That's a saving of $50 off the anticipated retail price of 
$225.<br/></p>
<p><b>FREE
Pop n Drop for disabled vets!</b></p>
<p></p><p>To
 all the US vets out there, I want to thank you for your service and the
 sacrifices you made. If you are a vet who uses a wheelchair and you are
 interested in a Pop n Drop, you deserve to get one for FREE.  So, as 
part of this campaign, I am providing a 'FUND A VET' option, for those 
interested in sponsoring a Pop n Drop for a disabled vet. </p><p>I

Compatibility</b></p>
<p>Pop n Drop does not require any
hardware mounted onto the wheelchair (an important point for most manual chair
users), but couples directly to the wheelchair. Since wheelchairs come in
various sizes and styles, each Pop n Drop is made to fit your wheelchair.The two measurements required for fitting are the foot support width and the tubing diameter (generally standard at ¾“ ). Please see photo that illustrates measuring of
the foot support.</p>
<p>Pop n Drop is not intended to be
used with folding wheelchairs or wheelchairs that have swing away foot rests.
 If your foot support is not of the style shown in the photo, please contact me before ordering.</p>
<p>While riding the scooter with Pop n
Drop attached, your wheelchair will be in a ‘popped’ position. If your
wheelchair foot support normally is positioned very close to the ground (1” to
2”), you may consider raising the foot support so that you are not riding in
such an extreme ‘wheelie’ position. The compatible scooters below have a deck
height of about 6”. </p>
<p><b>Scooter Compatibility<br/></b></p>
<p>Pop n Drop does NOT include the scooter. Recommended scooter
for the Pop n Drop is a lithium battery powered scooter. The scooter deck should not be more than 6-1/8“ wide.<br/></p>
<p>The scooter featured in the video is the EcoReco M3. It's a  high quality product with incredible performance features, like 20 miles on a charge and a top speed of over 20 miles per hour!</p>

<h3>The GRIP and Our Mission Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Dillon Badman. I represent a growing company, Frontier Industrial Applications LLC, in Rochester NY. We are here to make your life easier and worry free. Our team members come from all over the United States, including California, Delaware, Texas, and New York. We are young and motivated to bring a great product to our potential customers.</li>
<li>My father sprung this idea on me more than 2 years ago. There wasn't much steam, at first. I started out in my sisters spare room, gluing and cutting materials. Our business was established officially on January 5th of 2016. Over the last 8 months we have had two production lines in both NY and Texas, where only 5 individuals diligently produce black and white prototypes, create package designs, and spread the word through social media and word of mouth. </li>
<li>As of August 18, 2016 we have opened our production line to a Rochester based company. This partnership will allow us to mass produce <strong>The GRIP</strong> with a variety of colors and designs, propelling us to production capabilities that can match our sales. </li>
<li>We currently sell on <a href=""https://www.gogrippit.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.gogrippit.com</a> through purchasing vendors Square, Inc and PayPal. We are also setting up with Amazon fulfillment. Through our perks on Indiegogo you can purchase <strong>The GRIP</strong> today, by donating. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What we are all about</strong></p>
<ul><li>What is our product? <u>A phone grip accessory</u>. What does it provide? At the heart, it is comfort and security. This accessory attaches to your handheld device and creates a convenient and sleek ""holster"" for your fingers. That is the bare bones description. </li></ul>

<p>             The Duo: Black w/o design                          The Hybrid: Black w/o design</p>
<ul><li>Why must you have it? Let me ask you some questions. Have you ever dropped your phone?  How about on your face while laying on the couch? Or multiple times in one day? Tired of cracked screens? What about the fear of your phone slipping into the wrong hands? With The GRIP these problems will be a thing of the past.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>This accessory is revolutionary in the world of phone handling. And yet, it is so simple. Simple enough that we know everyone has the ability to apply it to their phone. Collectively we will create a new era of security and comfort to everyday phone use. </li>
<li>If users happen to run into any application problems we offer 100% guaranteed satisfaction. We will send you another GRIP free of charge, or your money back within 30 days of purchase. All we would like is to know what went wrong, and to give it another chance. This product works. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How you can help</strong></p>

<p>The GRIP allows you to take better selfies and make more extreme poses. You can have a hand free without ever worrying that your phone is in danger of slipping to the ground, or even being snatched by a sneaky passerby. We regret that this is the reality, but with The GRIP you will be squared away both in body and mind that your precious device, with all your pictures, social media plugs, and contacts is safe and secure where it should be, in your hand.</p>
<p>Use your imagination, we often experience and get feedback, that The GRIP allowed someone to peer over a mountain top, without a sweat or smidgen of anxiety. Imagine yourself at a pro sports game or even on the back of a motorcycle, in both cases there is opportunity for great pictures. At both there is great commotion and rattling, opening up opportunity for your phone to be dropped, clipped, or shaken from your very hands. NOT ANYMORE! The GRIP is the leading phone grip accessory and will leave you feeling calm and confident for the remainder of your device using days. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get: Our Business Model</h3>
<p><strong>Patent Fees</strong></p>
<ul><li>We already have filed a provisional patent ourselves, and we have a connection to a local patent lawyer. We estimate the rough cost to fulfill a non-provisional utility patent (the more official filing for those who are not familiar) will cost us $5000. That cost is mostly lawyer fees. Note that, typically, lawyer fees are the bulk of patent costs, because of the technical training and experience a patent lawyer holds ($325 /hr) and the amount of time needed to create a legitimate filing (10+ hours). We qualify as a micro entity and that gives us some USPTO filing fee breaks. Our breakdown is roughly as follows: USPTO filing fees include Basic  Filing ($70), Utility Search ($150), Utility Examination ($180), Issue Fee ($240), Processing (~$150). Summing lawyer ($3250+) and filing ($790) fees, comes to a grand total of $4040+. Unforeseen lawyer hours bring us to roughly $5000. </li></ul>
<p>Source for filing fees (USPTO fee schedule: <a href=""https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/fees-and-payment/uspto-fee-schedule"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/fe...</a>).</p>
<ul><li>Internationally we can file through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) to obtain utility protections in countries honoring the PCT (150+ countrties). This should cost us roughly $4000. </li></ul>
<p>Source PCT costs (<a href=""http://www.inventioncity.com/ask-mike/how-much-does-it-cost-for-international-patents"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.inventioncity.com/ask-mike/how-much-...</a>)</p>
<ul><li>We already have about half of this money, but we need your help to get us all the way there!</li></ul>
<p><strong>Raw Materials, Production, Distribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We're not done yet! In raw materials it costs us, on average $.33667 to produce a single item in our product line. That's 34 cents! And we are selling them at retail for $10. Don't bat your eyes, rejoice with us! This product is worth $10. We use the most high-end, quality materials we could find to build this product, there is no cutting corners (well, literally we do cut corners of fabrics and tapes!),  it just so happens that our assembly is dirt cheap in dollars and cents. But it is worth piles of sugar and gold in effectiveness and functionality, as well as in enthusiasm that our customers display! </li>
<li>Raw Material Grand Total for 7,500 units is $2,550.</li>
<li>Our production and distribution costs are our biggest price points. Production will cost us roughly $0.5-$1.0 per item for labor and machine maintenance, and we are still refining this cost analysis. Distribution will cost us roughly another $0.75, including packaging and shipping.</li>
<li>Production and Distribution are a big part of our initial funding requirements! This is why we are asking for $11,250 more dollars above and beyond patents and materials, in order to get our first 7,500 off the line.</li>
<li>Everything together comes to $16,800. Including some room for added design costs and unforeseen fees between shipping, lawyers and production, we come to a grand campaign total of $20,000.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Profit </strong></p>
<ul><li>10,000 units sold will translate into $81,600 profit and we will be on our way to continue on our own. With roughly 216.9 million phone users in the U.S. alone, we are talking <strong>$1.7 billion</strong>, if every American phone user bought just one. And multiple users buy more than just one. Are you feeling it yet!</li></ul>
<p>Source for American Phone users (<a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/2999631/phones/pew-survey-shows-68-percent-of-americans-now-own-a-smartphone.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2999631/phones/p...</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Future Direction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Follow me one step further, please! We do not see ourselves ending our product line with this particular phone grip accessory, in the grand scheme, we will still produce this version of The GRIP. But, we have a vision and dream pushing us towards full case integration! Why by a case, and an attachment for your case, when you can buy both in one? But since you already have a case, and you need to protect that case and the phone that it encases, please get behind The GRIP! </li>
<li>A future patent filing for the integrated case would cost us another $9000+, but we are planning on using pure profit to subsidize those costs! So you don't have to worry about it. Just wait and see!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Our Perks give you the opportunity to feel The GRIP for yourself! And believe us, once you have experienced this new found comfort and security, you won't believe that you've went this long without it! Furthermore, you'll never want to go without one again.</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471977815/tzil3ra4rldtsztb4ajg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Welcome Package Perk: Includes 1 Slim, 2 Duos, and 2 Hybrids + previous perks and a sticker!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal, it's not the end, not even close. You see any amount of funds gets us one step higher, and we know that we have a lot of steps to go.</p>
<ul>
<li>With the first couple hundred of dollars we get, we will move to securing our patent (TM's are already in place for the most part), and make a small production order. We already have enough product to reach hundreds, maybe thousands as I type this.</li>
<li>With the first couple thousand, we will make our first large scale production order, secure our patents, and start pushing designs.</li>
<li>With the full amount, we are set to secure all of our patents US and PCT, and produce 10,000 units, with a full range of colors and personalized designs. </li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges: We Need You!</h3>
<p>One of our biggest challenges is getting a large group of people to publicize our products by showing them off and spreading the word. And we are very much alone in this pursuit to secure your phone! Phone companies make profit from you breaking your phone. We want you to profit from not having to fork them over more cash then you already spend on your monthly bill and repair costs!</p>
<p>Mechanically, and in more rare instances, phones that have grooves or notches that do not allow for that adherence of The GRIP may not be fit to accommodate this accessory. There are ways around this, certain phone cases can allow for The GRIP if the phone does not. Further, if you contact us with this sort of problem and explain the particular situation, we may be able to custom fit The GRIP to your phone. All you have to do is ask, and we will try our best to deliver The GRIP to your device.</p>
<p>Another challenge is the naysayers and those who don't believe as hard as we do in this product. But every single person that has owned one, has become a believer. We need help converting the naysayers to yaysayers! Scream it from the rooftops with us. </p>
<p>Get The GRIP!</p>
<p>Together we can change the way the phone game is played!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help: Spread The Word</h3>
<p>The biggest help if you cannot contribute is to spread the word. Tell your neighbor, your coworker, your parents, your kids, you get the picture. Share our commercial on your Facebook page.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before:</p>

<li>Instagram: @Get_TheGRIP</li>
</ul>
<p>Just a reminder, if you think you cannot contribute, it is only $10 to get The GRIP on your phone today, and once you have it you can spread the word by taking more extreme photos, showing it off to your friends, family and everyone you run into. </p>

With the first couple hundred of dollars we get, we will move to securing our patent (TM's are already in place for the most part), and make a small production order. We already have enough product to reach hundreds, maybe thousands as I type this.

<h3>Your support - The Why</h3> <p>First of all - thank you for your interest. If you have read all the way here, you have expressed your interest! We have done the necessary hard work developing the hardware, testing it, rebuilding it and testing it again! We have also created the necessary software in Python and an interface for rpimonitor to accelerate your deployment. We have provided the necessary building blocks to launch the IoT applications.</p>
<p>Thousands of Pi-EzConnect boards are already in use across the world. We hope Pi-16ADC along with Pi-UpTimeUPS boards will also be equally successful. </p>
<p>We need the funds to complete the emission (FCC), safety and regulation testing for USA, Europe and rest of the world. </p>
<p>FCC testing, CE mark as well as UL testing will provide the validation these boards are safe to use and meets all the export and import regulations set forth by the countries. Once these regulations are confirmed, the boards can be used anywhere in the world. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">CE mark makes the board available in European and other countries.</span></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Raspberry Pi - the amazing platform </h3> <p>The Raspberry Pi is an amazing platform. The small size, great performance,  affordable price makes this computer a development tool of choice today over other platforms! The most recent version of Raspberry Pi model 3 also introduces Bluetooth support. Using Bluetooth, you can now interact with your cell phone or other Bluetooth devices.</p>
<p>We want the Raspberry Pi to be the platform of choice for IoT development to speed up creative products. We want people to take their creative work and test it outside - in real use situations. </p>
<p> People have used Raspberry Pi in amazing ways. We hope there will be new uses for the Raspberry Pi by providing the Pi a reliable UPS and analog sensor functionality - all at low overhead and high efficiency.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Raspberry Pi offers a flexible environment:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>OS flexibility: Linux, Windows or others. </li>
<li>Programming flexibility: C, Python, Java, other...</li>
<li>Networking flexibility: WiFi, BlueTooth, LAN, cellular....</li>
<li>Data storage flexibility: Local, USB drive, Cloud storage...</li>
<li>26 GPIO's for digital sensor connectivity</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>However, it is not easy to connect all 26 GPIO's via the headers available on the Raspberry Pi. To solve this problem, we introduced the Pi-EzConnect board almost 1 year back. </p>
<p>Now we are making it possible to add analog sensors and provide UPS functionality to the Raspberry Pi. </p>
<p>Pi-UpTimeUPS and Pi-16ADC provide that capability. With Pi-16ADC you can add 16 (or 8) Analog sensors. With Pi-UpTimeUPS and Pi-UpTimeUPS-BO, you can not only add 12 (or 6) Analog sensors, you also get battery backup power for the Raspberry Pi <u><i><b>and all the sensors - digital or analog</b></i></u>. And not for just a short time sufficient to shut down the Pi properly. Enough power to take the Raspberry Pi around or survive a long power outage. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The risks are minimal. All functionality has been tested. We use over-the-counter (OTC) components in our design. Usually more than one supplier provides these components. Supply side risks are also minimal.</p>
<p>Our challenge and next steps will be to make it easy for everyone to simply add a sensor and start viewing the information from the sensor via an Android app or an iPhone App.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>The biggest help is to contribute and / or commit to a perk. You can also purchase these boards for your school or friends to learn about IoT and how to leverage sensors to do things on a daily basis. Or warn about things. Or simply turn things on/off. Or flash lights. Your creativity is unleashed. Challenge your children to learn about programming and build devices which will be used on a day-to-day basis. Challenge your school group or your family and friends. </p>

IoT or Internet of Things
IoT involves sensors - some of them are digital and some of them analog. The information sensed by these sensors is displayed on your mobile device via Bluetooth or web or smartwatch or using other methods (Twitter, text etc.)


          

Sensing information accurately is critical. The sensors can be used as an IoT device, as a data logger, a controlling device or any other device which depends on accurate information to make some critical decision. Securing the sensors so that they do not fall off or get disconnected is also equally important. Keeping the sensors powered when wall-outlet power fails is also an key consideration. Taking the device with you to test or demonstrate or use the IoT capabilities you have developed is also needed to make your IoT device successful.


Executive Summary
We have four boards or HATs for the Raspberry Pi.



Pi-EzConnect - introduced in 2015, this board or HAT allows multiple  digital sensors or GPIO to be securely connected to a Raspberry Pi. Watch the video here.

Pi-16ADC - a sixteen (16) channel or a 16 port Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) board or HAT. Software, user manual and interface to rpimonitor is provided. Watch video here.

Pi-UpTimeUPS - provides uninterruptible power (or UPS) to the Pi for many hours. Pi-UpTimeUPS also allows power mobility. Compact and securely connected, allow you to take the Pi with you without having to shut-down and reboot it. Software monitors battery level and can shutdown the Pi when battery runs low. Watch video here.

Pi-UpTimeUPS-BO - combines the functions of Pi-16ADC and Pi-EzConnect in a breakout board that works with Pi-UpTimeUPS board, with all GPIO ports and  twelve analog ports available for use. You also get 5V UPS and 3.3V UPS power for other devices. Watch video here.

Morph the Raspberry Pi into a wizard.  Make your IoT or other dream projects come true - quickly, easily and cost effectively.  Use easy methods of interacting with the sensors with our boards. And the biggest advantage of all - you are still using your familiar, friendly Raspberry Pi.

Raspberry Pi-3 provides Bluetooth   Using a Pi-3 and Bluetooth, develop your custom app on a smartphone.  Access the data collected by the sensors using Bluetooth and send alerts on the phone. Do crazy things on the phone to wow people. 


When you need to take the Raspberry Pi and the sensors away from a wall outlet, the Pi-UpTimeUPS and the Pi-UpTimeUPS-BO (break out) board is there to help you. Use the same sensors. Use the same code.  Install two 18650 batteries on the Pi-UpTimeUPS board and take it with you - away from a wall power outlet for as long as 10-12 hours (time varies depending on what is connected to the Raspberry Pi and battery charge.) If longer run time is needed, use a solar panel to extend the run time. Or a wall plug. Monitor the sensors and the wonderful things you have done with your app on the phone. 

Tired of power fluctuations or power outages rebooting your Pi? Want to continue using the Pi when power fails? Want to take the Raspberry Pi with you to work or school or other places without having to shutdown or reboot it every time?  Pi-UpTimeUPS is perfect for these situations. The board monitors the power level and can shut down the Raspberry Pi in a graceful manner when the batteries run low. If power fails, the Raspberry Pi continues to operate for a long time! It also automatically charges the battery, manages the battery power level and cleans out any power fluctuations the Raspberry Pi may encounter, protecting your hardware. Further, the Pi-UpTimeUPS-BO board allows connections to all GPIO as well as twelve (12) analog ports. It connects to the Pi-UpTimeUPS board and also provides battery backed 5V and 3.3V UPS power for sensors.

For Power Mobility and Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS):  Mobility for a Raspberry Pi using Pi-UpTimeUPS


 Provides UPS functionality to a Raspberry Pi. Second generation of the Pi-UpTime board.
Uses two 18650 batteries for powering Raspberry Pi when there is no power or if power fails. (Batteries are not included.) Choose the capacity of the battery based on your needs. Replace them as needed. No special battery form factor to worry about now or in the future.
On-board battery protection provides necessary controls to ensure your battery is protected. These controls prevent over charging and deep discharge, protecting the battery. This extends the life of the batteries. Temperature sensor prevents over heating and shuts down the charging if the batteries get hot. No need to purchase expensive protected batteries.
Current limit protects the battery and the electronics against excessive surges.
The electronics charges the battery and provides power to Raspberry Pi at the same time. This feature also ensures that the battery is charged automatically after a power failure. 
 Protects the Raspberry Pi against brown outs. If additional power is demanded by the peripherals or sensors or the Raspberry Pi, Pi-UpTimeUPS provides that.
A reset switch makes the reboot easy after an orderly shutdown. No need to plug/unplug power supply or the batteries.
An added solder point is provided for an external reset switch.

Provides 12 analog ports. The same analog ports described above with Pi-16ADC board. Please refer to Pi-16ADC for the capabilities.

Sample Python code can be used for monitoring the battery level.
Instructions and code to monitor battery level and shut down the Raspberry Pi when battery is running low.
LED's indicate the status of the battery charging on the board.
Sensor on-board monitors if the power is on, the battery level, the current level and power consumed. No need to attach an external meter to measure voltage, current or power consumption. Monitor historical data using rpimonitor.
Provides separately generated uninterrupted 5V as well as 3.3V power. The board provided UPS for 5V and 3.3V. 3.3V is not tapped from the Raspberry Pi. Up to 800mA of power can be provided on the 3.3V supply, far exceeding the 3.3V power supply capability on the Raspberry Pi.
Interfaces  with rpimonitor to monitor the Pi and the battery and power status. Observe exactly when power fails. Provides both historical trends (graphs) and current sensor readings. Know exactly when power failed or when there is a power surge, and how the Raspberry Pi survived the power glitch!



Pi-UpTimeUPS board. As shown, this board is used as a UPS for the Raspberry Pi. See video below.






Analog and Digital sensors with UPS:  Pi-UpTimeUPS-BO with Pi-UpTimeUPS

A board custom built for Pi-UpTimeUPS. Attach the board to Pi-UpTimeUPS. Connect twelve analog devices or sensors as well as all the digital devices and sensors for a Raspberry Pi.

Solder points on the board allows other electronic components to be connected easily.



Pi-UpTimeUPS and PI-UpTime-BO board. Boards can be stacked in any order. In this picture, the Pi-UpTimeUPS board is on the top. The board is shown without any batteries. 


The capabilities are summarized below.







   
Your support - The Why First of all - thank you for your interest. If you have read all the way here, you have expressed your interest! We have done the necessary hard work developing the hardware, testing it, rebuilding it and testing it again! We have also created the necessary software in Python and an interface for rpimonitor to accelerate your deployment. We have provided the necessary building blocks to launch the IoT applications.
Thousands of Pi-EzConnect boards are already in use across the world. We hope Pi-16ADC along with Pi-UpTimeUPS boards will also be equally successful. 
We need the funds to complete the emission (FCC), safety and regulation testing for USA, Europe and rest of the world. 
FCC testing, CE mark as well as UL testing will provide the validation these boards are safe to use and meets all the export and import regulations set forth by the countries. Once these regulations are confirmed, the boards can be used anywhere in the world. CE mark makes the board available in European and other countries.
    

Raspberry Pi - the amazing platform  The Raspberry Pi is an amazing platform. The small size, great performance,  affordable price makes this computer a development tool of choice today over other platforms! The most recent version of Raspberry Pi model 3 also introduces Bluetooth support. Using Bluetooth, you can now interact with your cell phone or other Bluetooth devices.
We want the Raspberry Pi to be the platform of choice for IoT development to speed up creative products. We want people to take their creative work and test it outside - in real use situations. 
 People have used Raspberry Pi in amazing ways. We hope there will be new uses for the Raspberry Pi by providing the Pi a reliable UPS and analog sensor functionality - all at low overhead and high efficiency.

Raspberry Pi offers a flexible environment:


OS flexibility: Linux, Windows or others. 
Programming flexibility: C, Python, Java, other...
Networking flexibility: WiFi, BlueTooth, LAN, cellular....
Data storage flexibility: Local, USB drive, Cloud storage...
26 GPIO's for digital sensor connectivity


However, it is not easy to connect all 26 GPIO's via the headers available on the Raspberry Pi. To solve this problem, we introduced the Pi-EzConnect board almost 1 year back. 
Now we are making it possible to add analog sensors and provide UPS functionality to the Raspberry Pi. 
Pi-UpTimeUPS and Pi-16ADC provide that capability. With Pi-16ADC you can add 16 (or 8) Analog sensors. With Pi-UpTimeUPS and Pi-UpTimeUPS-BO, you can not only add 12 (or 6) Analog sensors, you also get battery backup power for the Raspberry Pi and all the sensors - digital or analog. And not for just a short time sufficient to shut down the Pi properly. Enough power to take the Raspberry Pi around or survive a long power outage. 
    
Risks & Challenges The risks are minimal. All functionality has been tested. We use over-the-counter (OTC) components in our design. Usually more than one supplier provides these components. Supply side risks are also minimal.
Our challenge and next steps will be to make it easy for everyone to simply add a sensor and start viewing the information from the sensor via an Android app or an iPhone App.
    
Other Ways You Can Help The biggest help is to contribute and / or commit to a perk. You can also purchase these boards for your school or friends to learn about IoT and how to leverage sensors to do things on a daily basis. Or warn about things. Or simply turn things on/off. Or flash lights. Your creativity is unleashed. Challenge your children to learn about programming and build devices which will be used on a day-to-day basis. Challenge your school group or your family and friends.",11.0,4,"3 Campaigns

</div><i> <div> <h3><br/></h3> <p><br/></p> </div> </i><p><br/></p></div>","It’s
truly as easy as 1-2-3: Select
a short, easy, and unique number when you register your account at
spellforme.com (easy numbers like 55, 733, 2525, or 334455 are available for the
first few backers!) Enter
information for future spelling (i.e. “your-name@websitename.com”, “your
address”) When
needed, just provide your number to the person on the other end and they can
find your information on spellforme.com
 There are two ways people can search for your
number! They can either enter it into the search bar at spellforme.com or type it right after the domain (click to see live example - spellforme.com/3476).Is there anything else? Yes! We make spelling even easier
for you: now you can always say “email me at 3476@spellforme.com”, where 3476
is your number, and the email will be carefully forwarded to your actual email
address.

It saves time: saying a few digits is faster than spelling whole
words,It makes spelling mistake-free: the person receiving the information can view
and copy your info right from their computer screen,It’s for everyone: everyone has some piece of
information that is either long or difficult to spell,It makes spelling easy: pronouncing a short number is way easier than
spelling words letter by letter,It free: basic
service will be free for everyone, full service will be free for backers
(see rewards); so why not use it?
 

Like
anything else that’s great in my life, it started from my wife. She made me
remodel our home, which by the way, wasn’t exciting and took more than an entire year. Yea, it was big! I’m
the guy who likes to investigate multiple options and compare different
opinions and prices before paying any cash. Therefore I was calling a bunch of
contractors, electricians, plumbers, painters, and even junk removers. So, every time I called, I had
to write their email or they had to write my email or address. 
I spelled my
email and address about 20 times, and then I asked myself, “is there any way to
make this process easier?” 
Spelling with numbers came to my mind: we don’t have
any problems spelling credit cards despite them being many digits… What if I only
needed to pronounce just 4, 5, or 6 digits? Later, I came up with the idea of searching up the short
number on a website, and having information displayed on an easy to read
website. After searching
for a good domain name, we came up with spellforme.com. I say we,
because at that point, my oldest son joined me on this venture. My day job is Chief of Technology for an Internet marketing company, so I’m mainly responsible for the tech side while his young mind fits marketing and social media.

Right now we are more than half way done with developing the project: the application framework setup is done, database schema is built, and even part of the real app functionality has been developed (i.e. actual app is running when you search 3476 on spellforme.com). Designing and programming applications is a complex process that requires a lot of funding. We are looking for a small $3000.00 of funding because the major part of application development will be done by Gregory. He has over a decade of experience in web-based software development and has no doubts this app will be complete soon. Most of the marketing will be done by Dan. Designing, UX/UI polishing, payment processing integration, and marketing materials is where we truly need the help. We want to deliver an awesome user experience to you. Please help us fund SpellForMe! 


I can see most of the
rewards providing backers with lifetime service and no hidden charges? Is it
true?!
Yes! All backers who obtain lifelong packages will be
provided with the service free of charge for the rest of this project life.


Will you provide
me with a choice of number?
Yes! For Silver level and above, depending on
your backer level, you will be given a choice of number types. For example, if you are a Platinum level backer, then you will be given 10 numbers similar to 2525 from which you can choose one.



When someone views
my info using my number, can they see my account information?
Big no-no! Only the information that you place for
spelling is available, so there’s no way to associate that information with
your personal information from the account (such as name, email, etc.).

Why can’t I obtain
an email with an easy number on Gmail? Something like 3476@gmail.com?
It’s not allowed or taken. First, Gmail is asking for a minimum of 6 characters: 

Second, all easy 6-digits and probably
most regular 6-digit numbers are taken:


Why can't I setup my own domain and create an email with an easy number?
Of course you can, but it will be more expensive in the long-run since backers get the service for a lifetime.

How will you sustain your business in the long run if the base service is free?
We want to use a simple concept: the 6-digit numbers are free; however, you are limited to a 32 character field where you can enter your information and no email forwarding. In order to have unlimited space and email forwarding, you have to purchase a service package for just $1.95 per month. Exclusive, short, and easy numbers are available for purchase from $2.95 to $19.95 per month as well. Explained pricing model is not applicable for project backers: their services are free for a lifetime!


There are only a few hundred short and easy numbers, so how can I make sure I will get one?

</div></div>","E-keyboard PC is the first complete Windows 10 PC housed in a keyboard  that fits your home & office use, just plug it with a monitor or  projector, it perfect   match your needs.

With a desktop, you get power. Build it with the right specs and there’s nothing  you won’t be able to run. Video games, hidef movies, as many windows as your  heart  desires: our Computers today can handle seriously heavy loads. With a  laptop,  however,you get portability. 

You can carry your machine with you everywhere you go throughout the day, and   if you go small enough, it’s no less convenient than carrying a mid-size book. With   these individual strengths, there are also inherent weaknesses. You won’t get very  far trying to lug a decent desktop around with you, and most laptops can run only  the most basic programs.
 
Now, at the crossroads of the desktop and the laptop, there is a new player in the  game. Our all-in-one media keyboard “ E-keyboard PC” combines the speed  and  capabilities of   a desktop with all the ease  and functionality of a laptop. All you  need to do is plug  in a screen and you’ll be able to play video games, watch movies, and surf the Internet with ease. The memory can be expanded, it supports an Android / Windows 10 dual system, and it comes with a four core processor and 32GB SSD. Plus, with ports for WiFi, speakers, headphones,  flash drive, an SD card, and a mouse, you’ll get to customize your experience to  exactly your liking.
















                                     Plug & Play 



Just as smartphone technology makes it so a whole computer can fit onto a phone. The Miguol E-Keyboard PC is a computer inside of a keyboard. Now, anywhere 


that there’s an HDMI screen be it a smart TV, a traditional monitor, or a projector  


you can plug in the E-keyboard PC, and the screen will turn into your Windows 10 enabled computer.



Step 1: Connect the E-keyboard PC to an HDMI & VGA cable and 


connect the cable to a screen.

  



Step 2: Connect the power cable to the E-keyboard PC and a power outlet. 

Step 3: Press power button Start working or playing.

 
Here you will see 





 Accessories

 Miguol has your peripherals covered. There are ports for an SD card, mouse, flash  drive, camera, headphones, wired connections, an AC adapter, and of course an HDMI monitor hookup. It’s easy to get any file you want on or off the E-keyboard PC.  In the absence of a mouse, the keyboard has an oversized touchpad  to use as a mouse or in  your  favorite apps designed for touchscreen functions. And  a  waterproof film on the keyboard means the E-keyboard PC will stand up to life.
By making the keyboard the center of your computing experience rather than the screen, we can reshape how we think about ownership of that experience. Your files will be in your hands and the power to change them will at your fingertips.
RFQ: 
Q1: How long is the max distance of bluetooth transmission?
A1:Over 10 meters .

Q2: Are all the TVs can be connected with it?
A2: Yes.

Q3: Do I need internet to connect  this PC first then it work?
A3: Yes. without internet  it just like a Isolated computer 

Q4:Does the APP come with both Android and IOS?
A4: Yes.

Q5: How long is the warranty period of the product?
A5: 1 year.

Right now, we have come to Indiegogo, trying to raising $10000. This startup capital will cover the costs of manufacturing, marketing, and distributing our all-in-one media keyboard. With your help, we will re-define the way people view power and efficiency in computing. Thank you

<h1>You can make it happen</h1>
<p>How often have you said ""someone should do something about that.""</p>
<p>Well, here's your chance to make a difference.</p>

<p>$1 buys the Bully app for one child in one school.</p>
<p>$30 buys a Bully app for every child in the class, and $500 buys a Bully app <br/>for a whole school.</p>
<p>Help us distribute the Bully app. You could be responsible for saving a child's life. And that child could be a child you know!</p>

<h3><br/></h3><h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<br/>Hello everybody, I'm Marco, I'm a physics researcher and a passionate of technologies and renewable energies. I've got some awards for innovations in that field and when, in 2006, I met <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLQSR6LmGh8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Giovanni Soldini</a> (see him in the movie!) we worked together to bring solar energy on sailing boats. <br/><br/>To that extent we started the development of a ultralight, flexible and powerful photovoltaic panel and of a suitable electronics able to maximize the energy yield with strongly variable sunlight (a common condition in a reggata). <br/><br/>Since that time we realized how is important to rest on reliable and powerful energy sources in any place and in any conditions. We thus promoted a start-up company (<a href=""http://www.solbian.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.solbian.eu</a>) which is nowaday a leader in the marine solar panels market. Our technology had been used on solar cars competing across the australian desert (<a href=""http://www.sunswift.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sunswift.com</a>, <a href=""http://www.ondasolare.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ondasolare.com</a>), to cross the ocean by <a href=""http://expeditionpacific.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rowing</a>, to power <a href=""http://www.bivaccogervasutti.com/immagini.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">shelters</a> on the highest mountains.
<br/><br/>We never stopped our innovation path in the field of green mobility (as an example, an electric motor not making use of expensive and environmentally harmful permanent magnets is just under initial test) and recently we focused our attention on the vast field of solar charging devices, realizing that they are generally poorly working or not so good in quality. Thus we reviewed our know how about solar panels and charge controllers, that  made sailors almost free from the need of using fossil fuels, to adapt it to that new field, we gathered some friends: designers, solar panel experts, electronic engineers, and after two years of attempts we are very proud of what we think is going to be the most advanced solar USB charger ever realized, the <b>Energy Flyer</b>!

<br/><br/>More than 12 W of solar cells and a sophisticate electronic board to reach energetic independence everywhere in the world, in the middle of the ocean or in the top of the mountains, or even on a exotic beach with power outlets too far from your beer! <b>Energy Flyer</b> will recharge quickly your phone (tablet, battery pack, camera...) in a sunny day but will be anyway able to give you some charge if clouds are in your sky. Rugged and lightweight, without any battery to give you only green energy and no pollution.<br/><br/>

<h3>SOLUTIONS?</h3>
First: POWER!

<br/><br/>We cannot really recharge a smartphone or a tablet with a 0.8 W solar panel! We need at least 10 W and we need to shrink the power in the smallest space, namely we need the most efficient solar cells on the market.

We choose the best <a href=""http://us.sunpower.com/about/sunpower-technology/most-efficient-solar/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SunPower®</a> cells, we need them if we want to <a href=""http://www.solarimpulse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fly</a>!

<br/><br/>Second: ELECTRONICS

<br/><br/>Solar cells produce current, but you cannot simply push the current in your battery, that would just spoil energy (if it ever works), <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_power_point_tracking"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">read why</a>.

Electronics must also take care of adapting the charger to every <i>nasty</i> mobile operating system, no more warning message!

Electronics must be efficient, reliable, small, and not too expensive too! A great challenge! But we have a great experience in that. Remember that we started working with photovoltaics for race sailing boats, where electronics is absolutely needed.

<br/><br/>Third: DESIGN, EASINESS OF USE, ROBUSTNESS.

No moving parts, no glass, advanced polymers, ergonomy...

and more... NO BATTERIES! <b>To be greener than GREEN!</b><br/><br/><h3>WHAT WE DID?</h3>
The starting point, just ideas.

<br/><br/>High-end solar chargers or solar inverters use <b>MPPT</b> to harvest all the available energy from the sun, why do not introduce the same in a small portable solar charger? We worked hard to fit all the power in a small and relatively inexpensive device.<b><br/><br/>As far as we know, our device is the smallest MPPT solar charger on the market. It is very efficient and incorporates interesting characteristics as no needs of external supply, namely no needs of batteries: you will see the Flyer waking up as soon as there is enough light!<br/><br/>SOLAR PANEL</b>
<br/>To have the most powerful cells on the market is not enough, different materials have been tested for the realization of the solar panel and panel frame. The final product must be highly reliable and extremely durable, even in harsh weather conditions, but we are not worried of that, remember our background. SOLBIAN, the company we promoted more than seven years ago, is helping us in realizing prototypes, and will take care of initial production. Here is some prototypes: #ZERO, ZERO.1 and ZERO.2 <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434312858/bp8rai8uifzmue4xpiqx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>DOES IT WORK?</h3>
A first prototype under the rain... when the panel is directed toward the sky, even in  so low light condition, the telephone is charging! The MPPT charger is able to drain every drop of energy from the sun.

<b></b><b>Energy Flyer</b> will be the most advanced solar USB charger in the market. The perfect choice for people who need energy without compromises, in the most critical missions, for leisure or work.

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1372800/files/20150410142756-Front.jpg?1428701276"" src="""" style=""""/>
<br/><br/>The solar panel: four high efficiency <a href=""http://us.sunpower.com/about/sunpower-technology/most-efficient-solar/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SunPower®</a> cells encapsulated in a polymeric structure suited to resist impacts and weathering. A total power of more than 12 W and a special sensitiveness in low light condition.

<br/><br/>The panel frame, available in different colors, will protect the edges and the four holes in the corners will allow fixing the <b>Energy Flyer</b> to your backpack or on your tent.
<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1372801/files/20150410142841-Back.jpg?1428701321"" src="""" style=""""/>
<br/><br/>The electronics: a MPPT charger able to maximize the solar panel power and in the meanwhile offer a stable 5V power supply via a standard USB port. <br/><br/>The charger is <b>powered directly by the solar</b> panel, even without any battery you will see its LED indicator glowing green as soon as enough light will shine on the panel face.

<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1372804/files/20150410142952-Particolare.jpg?1428701392"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>The green light will turn red when a USB device is connected, signalling the charging status.

 

<br/><br/><b>Energy Flyer</b> is studied to be at the top for technical characteristics, but we want also the <b>Energy Flyer</b> to be available to most of the people, allowing for large volume selling and consequent price decrease.

<b>We fixed our initial selling price at $150, with the hope of breaking down the $100 barrier as soon as possible.<br/><br/></b>
<b> </b>
<h3>WHY DO WE NEED YOU?<br/>
</h3>
The Energy Flyer works! We have been working on it in the past two years by using our personal funds. We started with CAD/CAM design and then we built 40 prototypes complete of solar panels, electronics, and plastic details (the electronics enclosure and the panel frame). Intensive testing on the field and in accelerated weathering environment are on their way. We also started marketing actions, giving some prototypes to testimonials, we hope to have good return from them. The cost of every prototype was obviously much higher than our price target, as can be easily understood:<br/><br/><table border='1""'>

<br/>Total prototype cost: $189
<b><br/>Target cost: $42.50</b>
<br/><br/>An industrial cost of $42 is what is needed to fit a $100 price on the 
shelf (packaging, marketing cost, commissions and obviously mark-up need
 to be added)
<br/><br/>That is the way we are used to work. All the projects we realized until now are characterized by a strong technological content and customization. <b>Mass market needs to be addressed in a different way, for that reason we need your contribution.<br/></b><h3><br/></h3><h3>Needed steps:</h3>
Increasing volumes will allow to decrease the cost of the solar panels and of electronics.<br/><br/><ul>
<li>We already started the contacts with manufacturing companies for mass production. Estimated investment is $5,000, for travelling, know-how transfer, and supply chain optimization.</li>
<li>Enclosure and frames need to be made by injection mold to reach the target cost. Mold design and realization cost is about $8,000 (for both the molds).</li>
<li>Packaging is under definition. Investment is $6,500.</li>
<li>Marketing is a must for the goal of increasing volume selling: $8,000, mainly in web based campaigns.</li>
<li>Over the total investment of $27,500 we need to calculate an overhead related to supervision costs and other expenses.</li>
<li>Moreover funding is needed to realize the first 1000 units, the minimum quantity for initial price reduction. We still cannot reach the $42 target, but we estimated a total cost of $55,000.</li>
</ul><br/>A grand total of about $90,000 is needed. Giovanni and I are not rich people but we want to invest in our idea. Beyond all our efforts until now, we still want to cover 40% of the future expenses, thus we are asking you to make a pledge to reach our goal!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435393127/nsak9g5v14vdcdpiwyrc.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<i>Will <b>Energy Flyer</b> recharge ALL the mobiles?
<br/></i>Never say ""ALL""! Mobile phone manufacturers like to change specifications and characteristics of their devices more often than needed. Until now we tried the <b>Energy Flyer</b> with the most common, and even with some not so common, mobile phones and tablets. We did not find problems. We are committed to make <b>Energy Flyer</b> a widely used product and thus we'll continue in testing its compatibility and solve any problem that could rise.<br/><br/><i>Are you going to add a battery to store the energy during the day and use it in the night?
<br/></i>We decided not to add any battery for several reasons. One is that all the devices have his own battery, we choose to recharge it directly. Another reason is the broad diffusion of battery packs. Choose freely the one you like, <b>Energy Flyer</b> will recharge it while you are discharging your cell phone. Last but not least, we are quite concerned about pollution produced by batteries proliferation. We do want to give you clean energy, <b>directly from the sun</b>!<br/><br/><i><b>Energy Flyer</b> is not so small, will you study a more compact design?
<br/></i>We wanted to make <b>Energy Flyer</b> a powerful device and to reach that goal we need space. Foldable solutions are possible but for the first product release we decided to keep it simple and make it robust, suited to the outdoor lifestyle. We are already thinking about the future evolution of the charger, but that will take its time. 

<br/><br/><h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<i>Hardware produced in volume is never simple, unforeseen shipping delays are always possible. However, we already built and tested several units and ramping up production should not hide any surprise. Energy Flyer is working and what is still needed is to give it a neat appearance, that can be done only with your help: electronics and PV panels can be ""home-made"" but we want to give you something beautiful to be kept in your hands! We believe the risks on this campaign are really manageable. We appreciate your support, and we are confident we'll stay inside our timeline.<br/><br/>Even if the crowdfunding campaign will not be completely successful, we are quite confident Energy Flyer will hit the market, thus we shall be able to reward our supporters in any case.<br/></i>

High-end solar chargers or solar inverters use MPPT to harvest all the available energy from the sun, why do not introduce the same in a small portable solar charger? We worked hard to fit all the power in a small and relatively inexpensive device.As far as we know, our device is the smallest MPPT solar charger on the market. It is very efficient and incorporates interesting characteristics as no needs of external supply, namely no needs of batteries: you will see the Flyer waking up as soon as there is enough light!SOLAR PANEL
To have the most powerful cells on the market is not enough, different materials have been tested for the realization of the solar panel and panel frame. The final product must be highly reliable and extremely durable, even in harsh weather conditions, but we are not worried of that, remember our background. SOLBIAN, the company we promoted more than seven years ago, is helping us in realizing prototypes, and will take care of initial production. Here is some prototypes: #ZERO, ZERO.1 and ZERO.2 DOES IT WORK?
A first prototype under the rain... when the panel is directed toward the sky, even in  so low light condition, the telephone is charging! The MPPT charger is able to drain every drop of energy from the sun.
Many thanks to Erica (6 year old) for shooting the movie! 

And if we have sun... see what is going on at the beach:Starring Sabina, Lucia, Elena, Alice e Caterina. Art works by SofiaOUR GOAL
Energy Flyer will be the most advanced solar USB charger in the market. The perfect choice for people who need energy without compromises, in the most critical missions, for leisure or work.


The solar panel: four high efficiency SunPower® cells encapsulated in a polymeric structure suited to resist impacts and weathering. A total power of more than 12 W and a special sensitiveness in low light condition.

The panel frame, available in different colors, will protect the edges and the four holes in the corners will allow fixing the Energy Flyer to your backpack or on your tent.

The electronics: a MPPT charger able to maximize the solar panel power and in the meanwhile offer a stable 5V power supply via a standard USB port. The charger is powered directly by the solar panel, even without any battery you will see its LED indicator glowing green as soon as enough light will shine on the panel face.

The green light will turn red when a USB device is connected, signalling the charging status.

 

Energy Flyer is studied to be at the top for technical characteristics, but we want also the Energy Flyer to be available to most of the people, allowing for large volume selling and consequent price decrease.

We fixed our initial selling price at $150, with the hope of breaking down the $100 barrier as soon as possible.
 
WHY DO WE NEED YOU?

The Energy Flyer works! We have been working on it in the past two years by using our personal funds. We started with CAD/CAM design and then we built 40 prototypes complete of solar panels, electronics, and plastic details (the electronics enclosure and the panel frame). Intensive testing on the field and in accelerated weathering environment are on their way. We also started marketing actions, giving some prototypes to testimonials, we hope to have good return from them. The cost of every prototype was obviously much higher than our price target, as can be easily understood:

Total prototype cost: $189
Target cost: $42.50
An industrial cost of $42 is what is needed to fit a $100 price on the 
shelf (packaging, marketing cost, commissions and obviously mark-up need
 to be added)
That is the way we are used to work. All the projects we realized until now are characterized by a strong technological content and customization. Mass market needs to be addressed in a different way, for that reason we need your contribution.Needed steps:
Increasing volumes will allow to decrease the cost of the solar panels and of electronics.
We already started the contacts with manufacturing companies for mass production. Estimated investment is $5,000, for travelling, know-how transfer, and supply chain optimization.
Enclosure and frames need to be made by injection mold to reach the target cost. Mold design and realization cost is about $8,000 (for both the molds).
Packaging is under definition. Investment is $6,500.
Marketing is a must for the goal of increasing volume selling: $8,000, mainly in web based campaigns.
Over the total investment of $27,500 we need to calculate an overhead related to supervision costs and other expenses.
Moreover funding is needed to realize the first 1000 units, the minimum quantity for initial price reduction. We still cannot reach the $42 target, but we estimated a total cost of $55,000.
A grand total of about $90,000 is needed. Giovanni and I are not rich people but we want to invest in our idea. Beyond all our efforts until now, we still want to cover 40% of the future expenses, thus we are asking you to make a pledge to reach our goal!

Will Energy Flyer recharge ALL the mobiles?
Never say ""ALL""! Mobile phone manufacturers like to change specifications and characteristics of their devices more often than needed. Until now we tried the Energy Flyer with the most common, and even with some not so common, mobile phones and tablets. We did not find problems. We are committed to make Energy Flyer a widely used product and thus we'll continue in testing its compatibility and solve any problem that could rise.Are you going to add a battery to store the energy during the day and use it in the night?
We decided not to add any battery for several reasons. One is that all the devices have his own battery, we choose to recharge it directly. Another reason is the broad diffusion of battery packs. Choose freely the one you like, Energy Flyer will recharge it while you are discharging your cell phone. Last but not least, we are quite concerned about pollution produced by batteries proliferation. We do want to give you clean energy, directly from the sun!Energy Flyer is not so small, will you study a more compact design?
We wanted to make Energy Flyer a powerful device and to reach that goal we need space. Foldable solutions are possible but for the first product release we decided to keep it simple and make it robust, suited to the outdoor lifestyle. We are already thinking about the future evolution of the charger, but that will take its time. 

Risks and challenges
Hardware produced in volume is never simple, unforeseen shipping delays are always possible. However, we already built and tested several units and ramping up production should not hide any surprise. Energy Flyer is working and what is still needed is to give it a neat appearance, that can be done only with your help: electronics and PV panels can be ""home-made"" but we want to give you something beautiful to be kept in your hands! We believe the risks on this campaign are really manageable. We appreciate your support, and we are confident we'll stay inside our timeline.Even if the crowdfunding campaign will not be completely successful, we are quite confident Energy Flyer will hit the market, thus we shall be able to reward our supporters in any case.",16.0,2,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Our StoryThere are many smart
bulbs in the market right now. However, none of them are affordable.
The gold standard of all smart bulbs the Philips hue retails for
$59.97USD..but seriously, who can afford that?

Other brands similar
to the hue markets for $40-45. There are ones selling between $20-30 but they are
simply just aren't bright enough, the reason why they cost so low is
because they are using 3-5w LED chips instead of the 7-9w which is
equivalent to the 60w traditional incandescent bulbs.

Also don't forget the cost of a hub
which can go for $40-80. The Spaceman smart bulb will be powered by Bluetooth 4.0 meaning there will be no need for additional hardware.Our mission then was set to find a way to pack this bulb with features and introduce it at an affordable price.How much will Spaceman Lighting's Smart Bulb sell for?drum roll please...

<b>incentive-based dividend network with secondary applications<br/></b><br/>by @bipedaljoe<br/><br/><br/><b><br/>Introduction<br/><br/></b>Resilience, as I call my technology, is something new. There are no metaphors for it. It´s part welfare system, part co-operative dividends. Part state and part market. It blends those two narratives together, and obsoletes the dichotomy between the market and the state. Think of it as a decentralised, free market, welfare system.<br/><br/>Co-operatives that provide dividends for their costumers have been around forever, in one form or another. When the Swedish Co-operative KF was at its peak in the 1960s, it held as much as 25 percent of the entire Swedish market (1). The co-operative business model has been proven successful. RESILIENCE is a new web-standard for dividend co-operatives like KF. These co-operatives still use 20th century technology, and RESILIENCE attempts to bring co-operative businesses into the 21st century and the digital age.<br/><br/> The RESILIENCE protocol hopes to establish a new standard for co-operativedividend networks much in the same way that the Ripple protocol has established a new standard for value exchange. The RESILIENCE protocol evolves the co-operative model, and hopes to establish a form of dividend network 2.0, that would provide all its members with a steady stream of income. This network would scale to the entire human population.<br/><br/><br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FZ2szRutyWNg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZ2szRutyWNg&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZ2szRutyWNg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/><br/><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>

<div><strong><br/></strong></div>RESILIENCE is an internet-protocol for an incentive-based peer-to-peer dividend network. This dividend network could potentially scale to the entire human population, and would support each human with a steady stream of income, in proportion to each humans unique interactions with co-operatives around the world.<br/><br/>RESILIENCE also has potential as an alternative to nation-state-based coercive taxation. The dividends could replace parts of traditional social security, and RESILIENCE also provides a framework for secondary applications,  social services such as minimum guaranteed income, healthcare and schools.<br/><br/><br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F-iuC77uDIG8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-iuC77uDIG8&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F-iuC77uDIG8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><h1><br/></h1>
<br/><br/><h1>WHAT IF WE COULD CREATE PEER-TO-PEER SAFETY NETS ?<br/><br/>The internet as a metaphor<br/><br/>
</h1>
<div>The TCP/IP protocols of the internet have transformed the way we communicate. Information used to travel through a centralised network. We had to send our messages through a voice that could be heard, like the jungle drum, or the national media outlet. Social media has transformed that, and we now communicate pretty much peer-to-peer, and Ideas spread through a distributed network (c) rather than a centralised one (a)</div>
<div>
<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1256277/files/20150228103938-baran1964.jpg?1425148778"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>The co-operative dividend-model has been designed for 20th century technology, and dividends are still shared based on a centralised design (a). The RESILIENCE protocol does for the co-operative model what social media did for communication, it brings it into the 21st century and the peer-to-peer model (c).<br/><br/><br/><h1><strong>Dividend Pathways</strong></h1>
<strong><br/><strong>Peer-to-peer dividend pathways<br/></strong><br/></strong><p>Every time you make a transaction with someone else inside the network, you create a dividend pathway. This pathway then connects you to that node, and also to everyone who´s connected to that node, and so on.</p>
<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fbxyjt2T_nLQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dbxyjt2T_nLQ&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fbxyjt2T_nLQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/>These pathways create the basic architecture of the network. Through them, you connect to your own unique network, that potentially scales and interconnects with a much waster network.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h1 style=""font-weight: bold;"">SECONDARY APPLICATIONS</h1>
<br/>The idea behind resilience is to empower co-operatives who use the dividend-model, and to give them a tool that they can use to support their community. RESILIENCE is a framework through which they can go beyond the limitations of the current model.<br/><br/>The question is really if there are enough co-operatives out there who would be interested in this, and I believe the answer is yes. Humans are wonderful, altruistic, and kind hearted. <br/><br/>RESILIENCE also provides a framework for secondary applications, through which the users can choose to donate part of their dividends to different causes. The idea here is that if corporations find it in themselves to support their community, then perhaps the members of the community will find it in themselves to support the less fortunate, or to support community services such as a minimum guaranteed income, schools, and healthcare.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Donation-based social service applications on top of the RESILIENCE protocol</h4>
<br/>The incentive to pay tax to RESILIENCE is very different than traditional coercive-force-based incentives. RESILIENCE has potential to create a global scale dividend network through completely voluntary means.<br/><br/>RESILIENCE also has potential as a platform for secondary applications. The dividend-revenue that passes through the network might be made accessible to secondary applications. There might be a lower threshold for a person to choose to give away part of his dividends through voluntary means, then for that person to choose to give away his earnings. The dividends might be perceived as a form of reward, and the threshold to choose to give part of them to social services such as schools, healthcare or unconditional basic income (UBI) might be lower than the threshold to, voluntarily, pay taxes to those services directly. The dividends network also serves as a sort of map. The dividend pathways are unique in that they very closely resembles the real human interactions that underlie them. The interactions between people and their technology and surrounding environment, that are played out in real time, are mirrored almost perfectly. <br/><br/>Your dividend pathways would be a form of map of your life playing out, and who and whom you shared your unfolding with. Any persons dividend pathways are an accurate representation of their social relationships, and any person might have dividend pathways that stretch all over the world. Each of these pathways tough exist in financial proximity to a network of its own. For example, if you live for just a short time in India, and create $2000 in dividend pathways, then these $2000 might be taxed as you receive your dividends through them.<br/><br/><br/>If the RESILIENCE protocol works, it might be the ideal platform to use as for donating to social service applications. It would have a dedicated user-base that have joined through personal incentives, it would interface every financial platform online, and it would be built on a database that stores an (ever evolving) map over the state of the world. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1256445/files/20150228114014-Internet_map_1024.jpg?1425152414"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/><h1>
<strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">Basicincome.co <br/></strong>
</h1>
<h3><strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">basic income through donated dividends</strong></h3>
<br/>Basicincome.co is an application that runs on top of the RESILIENCE protocol. Users within the RESILIENCE framework may choose to share their dividends with those in financial proximity to their dividend pathways. You would only donate to those who could be seen as part of your society, those who you have shared a financial and social proximity to. <br/><br/>Through connecting Basicincome.co as an application, your dividend pathways would be made accessible to the application, and parts of your dividends would be used to fund an UBI for those in financial proximity to your pathways. Users who use Basicincome.co to receive UBI 'reach out' to dividend pathways that they are inter-connected and enmeshed with, and receive a boost so that their dividend yield reaches the amount that Basicincome.co has computed would cover basic needs.<br/><br/>

<h1>RESILIENCE: Co-operatives 2.0</h1>
<br/><h3><b>The Incentive Structure - How does it work ?</b></h3>
<br/>The incentive layer designed by Johan Nygren is simple, yet powerful: if a person or corporation consumes from someone outside the network, they get disconnected. Only temporarily. If they buy for $100 from someone outside the network, they get disconnected for the duration it takes for $100 in dividends to flow through them. <br/><br/>This is very meta and recursive because if a node gets disconnected, all their consumers also get disconnected, and so on. Which means that staying connected will make a node extremely attractive to others who want to stay connected.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>This incentive mechanism was described brilliantly in the <a href=""http://www.coinssource.com/bitnation-decentralized-borderless-government-universal-basic-income/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Coinssource.com article</a>,</p>
<blockquote>“This means that consumers who want to receive dividends will benefit greatly from seeking out co-operatives that are connected to the RESILIENCE protocol. Therefore, corporations are incited to join the network in their effort to gain and keep costumers. Not only will this mean that consumers can create a resilient financial safety net through making active consumerist choices. The corporations will also be encouraged to take greater financial responsibility for their entire supply line.”</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote><i><br/></i></blockquote>
<div>
<p>So the idea is: Imagine you own a company, and imagine you choose to join Basicincome.co to support your network. The fact that you, and your supply chain, offer social security that is superior to what the state provides will not only make you a better person but will also make you more attractive to potential costumers. It´s a simple, yet powerful incentive structure.<br/><br/><br/>Here´s a video by Johan that should give you a feeling of it,</p>

<h3>What we will do with the $20,000</h3>
<br/>The past 6 months have gone into developing prototypes and media content. The money we raise from this campaign will be invested in developing a more scalable server architecture, as well as the development of stand alone apps that provide extended support for coins outside the Ripple ecosystem, and the next release will support BitCoin, Ethereum, NXT, Ripple, and will provide APIs that simplify the process of integrating new coins with the Basicincome.co application.<br/><br/>With the help of you backers, we´ll be able to finish this technology this year, 2015, and we believe that our incentive-based peer-to-peer safety net system will be a key technology for the society of the future. Basicincome.co will continue to be an open-source and creative commons asset, and the innovations that we put online will probably come to change the world in ways very similar to the TCP/IP protocols that gave birth to the internet 30 years ago.</div>

<h3>Technical: Connect any bank-provider </h3>
<br/>Basicincome.co has been designed to work with every bank-provider online. Think Ripple, Bitcoin, Ethereum. It also provides technical support for old nation-state-tech like US-banks and Swedish-banks and so on that want to upgrade their API to work with Basicincome.co. <br/><br/>The way this works is technically simple. Ripple and Bitcoin have open APIs, so Basicincome.co has full knowledge of its users transactions. Basicincome.co then keeps tracks of how much dividends each user should contribute, and to whom. The users then need to sign in from time to time to pay out their dividends, or connect an app that automates this process.<br/><br/><h3>
<br/><br/>Technical: BitTorrent-like Optimization Algorithm</h3>
<br/>The DApp uses a really simple dividend algorithm - it computes that you share dividends with <b>everyone</b> who´s connected to your swarm. It then adds an optimization algorithm that routes and optimizes that traffic. This limits the traffic load on each financial platform (eg Ripple, Bitcoin).</div>

</div></div>","http://basicincome.co is a first attempt at providing a decentralized safety net Network that can compete with the state. it uses an incentive-structure that´s the exact opposite of current tax-collection.
Imagine if you took your insurance company, bred it with kickstarter, mixed in some reward mechanisms and added a bit of Martin Luther King. Voila. A free market, incentive-based, welfare system.
Through implementing incentive-based voluntary taxation, the system is freed from the hierarchical social structure that is inherent to systems based on coercive force. Basicincome.co marks the end of the nation-state, and the beginning of a society based on voluntary participation and open collaboration.
Recently adopted by Bitnation, an internet-based political organization that´s a sort of Pirate Party 2.0, lead by TED-speaker Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof , it´s been described as an 'astonishing system that can cater to individuals in a completely decentralized way, and lead the way for people to see the true power of decentralization and the peer-to-peer model.'.
I´m happy to present you with my recent work. This is the revolution.-Johan Nygren, the creator

'You never change things by fighting the existing reality.To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete'
-Buckminster Fuller


What if we could create a free market welfare system that´s better than the state ?
Enter Basicincome.co - a revolutionary new technology. Imagine if you took your insurance company, bred it with kickstarter, mixed in some reward mechanisms and added a bit of Martin Luther King. Voila. A free market, incentive-based, welfare system, a revolutionary new idea, and a technology that´s already made a name for itself online.

Decentralizing basic income: basicincome.cohttps://moneyless.org/decentralizing-basic-income






*Basicincome.co is an application built on top of the RESILIENCE protocol. The RESILIENCE protocol is an evolution of to co-operative dividend-model, and a framework for secondary applications such as Basicincome.co. 



The RESILIENCE protocol
incentive-based dividend network with secondary applicationsby @bipedaljoeIntroductionResilience, as I call my technology, is something new. There are no metaphors for it. It´s part welfare system, part co-operative dividends. Part state and part market. It blends those two narratives together, and obsoletes the dichotomy between the market and the state. Think of it as a decentralised, free market, welfare system.Co-operatives that provide dividends for their costumers have been around forever, in one form or another. When the Swedish Co-operative KF was at its peak in the 1960s, it held as much as 25 percent of the entire Swedish market (1). The co-operative business model has been proven successful. RESILIENCE is a new web-standard for dividend co-operatives like KF. These co-operatives still use 20th century technology, and RESILIENCE attempts to bring co-operative businesses into the 21st century and the digital age. The RESILIENCE protocol hopes to establish a new standard for co-operativedividend networks much in the same way that the Ripple protocol has established a new standard for value exchange. The RESILIENCE protocol evolves the co-operative model, and hopes to establish a form of dividend network 2.0, that would provide all its members with a steady stream of income. This network would scale to the entire human population.
Dividend co-operatives in Sweden, 1950-present

""The dividend scheme makes it more advantageous to be a loyal Coop member. As more people realize the economic benefits, the idea is that more people will become members, more people will shop at Coop and that casual customers will transform into regulars and consolidate their purchases to Coop. This will make Coop more profitable, making it possible to further improve the stores and offers to members. ""-@CoopSverige, In Brief, 2010 


Bitnation and Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)
RESILIENCE is an internet-protocol for an incentive-based peer-to-peer dividend network. This dividend network could potentially scale to the entire human population, and would support each human with a steady stream of income, in proportion to each humans unique interactions with co-operatives around the world.RESILIENCE also has potential as an alternative to nation-state-based coercive taxation. The dividends could replace parts of traditional social security, and RESILIENCE also provides a framework for secondary applications,  social services such as minimum guaranteed income, healthcare and schools.
WHAT IF WE COULD CREATE PEER-TO-PEER SAFETY NETS ?The internet as a metaphor

The TCP/IP protocols of the internet have transformed the way we communicate. Information used to travel through a centralised network. We had to send our messages through a voice that could be heard, like the jungle drum, or the national media outlet. Social media has transformed that, and we now communicate pretty much peer-to-peer, and Ideas spread through a distributed network (c) rather than a centralised one (a)



The co-operative dividend-model has been designed for 20th century technology, and dividends are still shared based on a centralised design (a). The RESILIENCE protocol does for the co-operative model what social media did for communication, it brings it into the 21st century and the peer-to-peer model (c).Dividend Pathways
Peer-to-peer dividend pathwaysEvery time you make a transaction with someone else inside the network, you create a dividend pathway. This pathway then connects you to that node, and also to everyone who´s connected to that node, and so on.
These pathways create the basic architecture of the network. Through them, you connect to your own unique network, that potentially scales and interconnects with a much waster network.SECONDARY APPLICATIONS
The idea behind resilience is to empower co-operatives who use the dividend-model, and to give them a tool that they can use to support their community. RESILIENCE is a framework through which they can go beyond the limitations of the current model.The question is really if there are enough co-operatives out there who would be interested in this, and I believe the answer is yes. Humans are wonderful, altruistic, and kind hearted. RESILIENCE also provides a framework for secondary applications, through which the users can choose to donate part of their dividends to different causes. The idea here is that if corporations find it in themselves to support their community, then perhaps the members of the community will find it in themselves to support the less fortunate, or to support community services such as a minimum guaranteed income, schools, and healthcare.Donation-based social service applications on top of the RESILIENCE protocol
The incentive to pay tax to RESILIENCE is very different than traditional coercive-force-based incentives. RESILIENCE has potential to create a global scale dividend network through completely voluntary means.RESILIENCE also has potential as a platform for secondary applications. The dividend-revenue that passes through the network might be made accessible to secondary applications. There might be a lower threshold for a person to choose to give away part of his dividends through voluntary means, then for that person to choose to give away his earnings. The dividends might be perceived as a form of reward, and the threshold to choose to give part of them to social services such as schools, healthcare or unconditional basic income (UBI) might be lower than the threshold to, voluntarily, pay taxes to those services directly. The dividends network also serves as a sort of map. The dividend pathways are unique in that they very closely resembles the real human interactions that underlie them. The interactions between people and their technology and surrounding environment, that are played out in real time, are mirrored almost perfectly. Your dividend pathways would be a form of map of your life playing out, and who and whom you shared your unfolding with. Any persons dividend pathways are an accurate representation of their social relationships, and any person might have dividend pathways that stretch all over the world. Each of these pathways tough exist in financial proximity to a network of its own. For example, if you live for just a short time in India, and create $2000 in dividend pathways, then these $2000 might be taxed as you receive your dividends through them.If the RESILIENCE protocol works, it might be the ideal platform to use as for donating to social service applications. It would have a dedicated user-base that have joined through personal incentives, it would interface every financial platform online, and it would be built on a database that stores an (ever evolving) map over the state of the world. 

Basicincome.co 

basic income through donated dividends
Basicincome.co is an application that runs on top of the RESILIENCE protocol. Users within the RESILIENCE framework may choose to share their dividends with those in financial proximity to their dividend pathways. You would only donate to those who could be seen as part of your society, those who you have shared a financial and social proximity to. Through connecting Basicincome.co as an application, your dividend pathways would be made accessible to the application, and parts of your dividends would be used to fund an UBI for those in financial proximity to your pathways. Users who use Basicincome.co to receive UBI 'reach out' to dividend pathways that they are inter-connected and enmeshed with, and receive a boost so that their dividend yield reaches the amount that Basicincome.co has computed would cover basic needs.






BitNation Pangea and the P2P-paradigm
""20th December 2014, Kumasi, Ghana: the Decentralized Application (DApp) basicincome.co will be hosted on the Bitnation core platform - Bitnation Pangea - after its release in 2015. ""-Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, http://bitnation.co

This is an astonishing system that can cater to individuals in a completely decentralized way. This, added to the existing services which BitNation aims to provide on a global scale, can lead the way for people to see the true power of decentralization and the peer-to-peer model.-Basic income - Provided by Computers, Coinssource.com





RESILIENCE: Co-operatives 2.0
The Incentive Structure - How does it work ?
The incentive layer designed by Johan Nygren is simple, yet powerful: if a person or corporation consumes from someone outside the network, they get disconnected. Only temporarily. If they buy for $100 from someone outside the network, they get disconnected for the duration it takes for $100 in dividends to flow through them. This is very meta and recursive because if a node gets disconnected, all their consumers also get disconnected, and so on. Which means that staying connected will make a node extremely attractive to others who want to stay connected.


This incentive mechanism was described brilliantly in the Coinssource.com article,
“This means that consumers who want to receive dividends will benefit greatly from seeking out co-operatives that are connected to the RESILIENCE protocol. Therefore, corporations are incited to join the network in their effort to gain and keep costumers. Not only will this mean that consumers can create a resilient financial safety net through making active consumerist choices. The corporations will also be encouraged to take greater financial responsibility for their entire supply line.”



So the idea is: Imagine you own a company, and imagine you choose to join Basicincome.co to support your network. The fact that you, and your supply chain, offer social security that is superior to what the state provides will not only make you a better person but will also make you more attractive to potential costumers. It´s a simple, yet powerful incentive structure.Here´s a video by Johan that should give you a feeling of it,




Dividend Pathways - What are they ?


“In my Basic Income #DApp, your safety net emerges from the sum of your financial interactions, allowing you to live and evolve as a global and mobile citizen. Basicincome.co transforms the stage upon which we unfold.”-From Coinssource.com´s feature about Basicincome.co








There´s already a test network online that gives a taste of what the finished product promises to do, and a live visual representation of it is online at graph_dev.basicincome.co. You can even create an account of your own, and test what it feels like to grow your own personal safety net.










Basicincome.co provides you with your own unique safety net, and connects the world as the global economy it is.-Johan Nygren, inventor of Basicincome.co




What we will do with the $20,000
The past 6 months have gone into developing prototypes and media content. The money we raise from this campaign will be invested in developing a more scalable server architecture, as well as the development of stand alone apps that provide extended support for coins outside the Ripple ecosystem, and the next release will support BitCoin, Ethereum, NXT, Ripple, and will provide APIs that simplify the process of integrating new coins with the Basicincome.co application.With the help of you backers, we´ll be able to finish this technology this year, 2015, and we believe that our incentive-based peer-to-peer safety net system will be a key technology for the society of the future. Basicincome.co will continue to be an open-source and creative commons asset, and the innovations that we put online will probably come to change the world in ways very similar to the TCP/IP protocols that gave birth to the internet 30 years ago.




Technical: Connect any bank-provider 
Basicincome.co has been designed to work with every bank-provider online. Think Ripple, Bitcoin, Ethereum. It also provides technical support for old nation-state-tech like US-banks and Swedish-banks and so on that want to upgrade their API to work with Basicincome.co. The way this works is technically simple. Ripple and Bitcoin have open APIs, so Basicincome.co has full knowledge of its users transactions. Basicincome.co then keeps tracks of how much dividends each user should contribute, and to whom. The users then need to sign in from time to time to pay out their dividends, or connect an app that automates this process.
Technical: BitTorrent-like Optimization Algorithm
The DApp uses a really simple dividend algorithm - it computes that you share dividends with everyone who´s connected to your swarm. It then adds an optimization algorithm that routes and optimizes that traffic. This limits the traffic load on each financial platform (eg Ripple, Bitcoin).

Technical: Security, Privacy and Cryptography
The DApp does not need access to your cryptographic keys. Basicincome.co creates a list of dividend payments, and you then sign them client-side. These payments could even be issued manually by you from your bank-app, or you could use a client that automates that process. Basicincome.co then reads your ledger and updates your server-side data.Check out these clients for an example, http://connect.basicincome.co/#/http://update.basicincome.co
