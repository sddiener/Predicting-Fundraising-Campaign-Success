We have been awarded several prizes for the usefulness that Insulclock will have. We just have finished the last miniaturized prototype that will enable us to reach the final version.<br/><br/>After hard work, we are closer to offer INSULCLOCK to millions of diabetics around the world, and for this we need your help. <b>We offer you the opportunity to take part in this project collaborating with a donation or a pre-purchase of an exclusive Insulclock.</b> This will be very helpful to commercialize Insulclock in the near future.<br/><br/> </p><h3>Support us</h3><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486499023/jrt0avut6nzfx9uybomc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><div>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why do we need you?</span></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Insulclock is a very ambitious project that can have a prevalent impact, worldwide, since all diabetic people can benefit from its advantages. For its development we have created a small company (startup), Insulcloud, S.L, we are not a big pharmaceutical company but a small group of entrepreneurs, moved by a dream to help the lives of people with diabetes that are treated with insulin. The necessary resources to develop Insulclock have been our own resources and prizes for development of innovation. Now, we begin a crowdfunding campaign in which you have the opportunity of collaborating in this project through donations or buying the packs we offer you.</p>

<h3>Donate Insulclocks</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The costs associated with diabetes are very high, and it is necessary to create a method to control the disease for an affordable price. With this motivation, Insulcock was born, and that is why we offer the possibility to help diabetic children from impoverished backgrounds. Thus, we kindly ask that you donate some money so they can have their Insulclock through our “Insulclock donation” pack.</p>

Who is Insulclock for?

 
 
 
For the people with diabetes that are treated with insulin: Insulclock can help improve the quality of life and security of diabetic patients, keeping track of an automatic register of the administering of insulin.
For diabetic caregivers: Insulclock utilizes an alert system that enables the caregiver to keep a surveillance of the treatment.
In pediatrics: Insulclock represents a great peace of mind for parents of children with diabetes because they will receive alerts when their child administers or doesn't administers the insulin. 

 
 
Insulclock is an electronic device that attaches to the insulin pen, recording and processing the data of the treatment administering and sending it to your smartphone to generate reports, establish alerts and to have a record of the insulin administering.
 

Clock: Shows when I took my last insulin intake.
Amount of insulin administered (in future versions)
Type of insulin
Alarms: when should I take the next insulin intake, or if I forgot it. In both cases, your caregiver will recieve a message.
Data storing: The mobile application automatically creates your daily log, creating periodical reports. Furthermore, if they are authorized, your caregivers and doctors can access your data in real time.
Thermometer: Insulclock measures the temperature to assure the correct insulin conservation.
Universal: Insulclock adapts to most common insulin pens. 
 Reusable: Insulclock can be used in several pens of the same kind of insulin until the battery is exhausted. Furthermore, the battery can be changed. 
Free App: for all Insulclock users

 
Insulclock history
  We are José Luis López and Jesús Arenas. We both know the serious condition diabetes is, because we have family and friends that they are diabetic patients, and especially because José Luis is a diabetic and heknows first hand what diabetes is all about.Like many others, José Luis has suffered from hyperglycemia and hypoglycemiadue to mistakes in his insulin administration, he is not as strict as he should be with his daily record.        We couldn't find any solution that helped us to better control the diabetes of José Luis. To our surprise, nobody has applied the latest technology in mobile devices to insulin pens. That's why, we decided to combine our knowledge and creativity to create Insulclock.José Luis is a web professional with experience in Software, webs, apps, whereas Jesús is Technical Engineering and Technology Industry.Two years ago we undertook this goal, and looking back at that time, the project has evolved enormously: After many conversations with diabetics, parents of diabetic children and physicians, we have agreed the most useful tools and design for the users.Now we are a big team as new partners join our team, excited by this project. We have been awarded several prizes for the usefulness that Insulclock will have. We just have finished the last miniaturized prototype that will enable us to reach the final version.After hard work, we are closer to offer INSULCLOCK to millions of diabetics around the world, and for this we need your help. We offer you the opportunity to take part in this project collaborating with a donation or a pre-purchase of an exclusive Insulclock. This will be very helpful to commercialize Insulclock in the near future. Support us    
 
Why do we need you?
 
Insulclock is a very ambitious project that can have a prevalent impact, worldwide, since all diabetic people can benefit from its advantages. For its development we have created a small company (startup), Insulcloud, S.L, we are not a big pharmaceutical company but a small group of entrepreneurs, moved by a dream to help the lives of people with diabetes that are treated with insulin. The necessary resources to develop Insulclock have been our own resources and prizes for development of innovation. Now, we begin a crowdfunding campaign in which you have the opportunity of collaborating in this project through donations or buying the packs we offer you.
 
 
 The resources we acquire in this campaign will be used to finish Insulclock and bring it to the market, so contributing to this cause you will help improve the quality of life, for millions of diabetics that use insulin.
 
 
 
 
Donate Insulclocks
 
 
The costs associated with diabetes are very high, and it is necessary to create a method to control the disease for an affordable price. With this motivation, Insulcock was born, and that is why we offer the possibility to help diabetic children from impoverished backgrounds. Thus, we kindly ask that you donate some money so they can have their Insulclock through our “Insulclock donation” pack.
 
 
 
  
 
 
Other ways to help us
 
 
Although you can´t help us with money, we need you to share this campaign with all your friends in social media and tell them to share again. This way you will help us reach the maximum number of supporters.

¿Para quién es Insulclock?

 
 
 
Para todas las personas con diabetes tratadas con insulina. Insulclock puede ayudar a mejorar la calidad de vida y seguridad del diabético llevando un registro automatizado de la administración de insulina.
Para cuidadores de personas dependientes con diabetes. Establece un sistema de alerta que permite hacer un seguimiento muy estrecho del tratamiento.
En pediatría, Insulclock supone una gran tranquilidad para los padres de los niños con diabetes ya que reciben alertas cuando el niño se administra o no se administra la insulina.
 

 
""¿Me he puesto hoy la insulina?""
""Con este calor ¿Estará la insulina en buen estado?""
""¿Se habrá puesto mi hija la cantidad correcta de insulina?""
¿Serán correctos estos datos del paciente?
 
 
  Insulclock es un dispositivo electrónico que se adhiere a la pluma de insulina recogiendo y procesando datos sobre la administración del tratamiento y enviándolos a tu teléfono para generar informes, establecer alertas y en definitiva llevar un seguimiento de la administración de la insulina.


 Reloj: Muestra cuando me puse la última inyección
 Cantidad de insulina administrada (en versiones posteriores)
 Tipo de insulina
Alarmas: cuando me toca la siguiente administración de insulina, o si se me ha olvidado. En ambos casos el cuidador o la persona a tu cargo puede recibir un mensaje de aviso.
Almacenamiento de datos: La aplicación confecciona automáticamente tu diario en lo que a la administración de insulina se refiere, generando informes periódicos. Además, si están autorizados, tus cuidadores y médicos pueden acceder a los informes en tiempo real.
 Termómetro: Insulclock mide la temperatura para asegurar la correcta conservación de la insulina
 Universal: Insulclock se adapta a los bolígrafos de insulina más comunes
 Reutilizable: Insulclock se puede utilizar para varias plumas de una misma insulina hasta agotar la batería, y cuando la batería se gasta se puede cambiar por otra fácilmente
  Acceso gratuito a la App para todos los usuarios de Insulclock

Tras muchas conversaciones con diabéticos, padres de niños con diabetes y especialistas médicos, se han consensuado las funcionalidades y el diseño que van a resultar más útiles para los usuarios.Ahora ya somos un gran equipo formado por cada vez más compañeros, enamorados de este proyecto.

<div><br/></div> <p style=""text-align: center;"">Developing an unparalleled relaxation experience comes with a host of risks and challenges. In order for our team to make Overman the fully immersive, stress-free, extraordinary experience that we have envisioned, it will require time and iteration.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p>In order to accelerate our progress, we’re working with local passionate, driven and dedicated teams and businesses around Fort Collins. Building Overman is a dream come true and we will do whatever it takes to bring  flotation to Fort Collins.</p>
<p>We anticipate the typical trials and tribulations that come with business and have tried to build that into our timeline goals. To get everything just right and deliver the unmatched experience flotation therapy, we’ll likely have some revisions along the way and keep you updated between every step..</p>Our team is committed to our timeline and constant communication with our backers. As issues arise, we will address and correct them. We’ll be sure to let you know our status at every possible milestone.<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our biggest challenge currently is taking our puny life savings and stretching it to its full potential. We've invested $51,000 personal funds among us and will have $259,000 from the banks, but we sill need an additional $30,000 (after campaign fees &amp; perk costs) to make our float center the vision we have been striving  for. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We are confident that we will be able to overcome this hurdle with the help of our wonderful community and our drive to succeed. The center will open no matter the outcome of our campaign, but in order to make our vision a true success we would love to be able to put in the little extra to take it from good to great.</p>

Overman the ""Float Family""


We are a family from Georgia who moved out west with an idea and a passion to help build better people; we are Overman, and we want to bring Flotation Therapy to Fort Collins, Colorado. 
This IndieGoGo campaign is designed to help us raise money and awareness for floating. You, our dearest donor, can help us make this dream of ours into a reality. We know that with your help, we will be able to make the best Flotation Therapy Center in all of Colorado. Help us make you, and Fort Collins, proud!



Bringing flotation therapy to FoCo has been a family effort for nearly two years now and we are thrilled to have our grand opening to the public planned for November 2016. But alas, we need your help!



Bobus, Little Roo, Alex, Blake, Logan, Nathan, and the countless other people who have helped get Overman to this point have made the journey well worth it. Thanks to all of you for your effort and support throughout these years!



The Impact

We at Overman believe that Flotation Therapy can help everyone. The benefits that regular floating provides -with stress relief being the main benefit- are well documented to help with accelerated healing, cortisol reduction, and deep relaxation. 
Specific ailments that benefit include: Anxiety, Arthritis, Asthma, Autism, Diabetes, Digestion Problems, Fibromyalgia, Headaches/migraines, Heart Disease, Insomnia, Jet Lag, Magnesium & Sulfate deficiency, Neck & back Pain, Osteoporosis, Peptic Ulcers, Pregnancy pains, Premenstrual Syndrome, Scoliosis, Sore Muscles, Stroke.

You, our beloved donor, can help us bring this wonderful technology to the city of Fort Collins, Colorado. We think that Fort Collins is the perfect place for our store, and we want to be able to provide this awesome service to this amazing city! 



How can I help bring float therapy to Fort Collins?



We are opening our center this Fall regardless of the campaign, but your help funding this project is crucial in allowing us to offer the best service possible for Fort Collins.


The ever increasing construction costs associated with building our center is the main focus throughout our campaign. Soundproofing and build out are the bulk of the expenses, and also happen to be the most crucial. Without proper soundproofing and building design the experience can suffer greatly due to noises being heard while floating. 

This is why we turn to you fellow floater, because with your help we can make it happen!

    Risks & Challenges
 Developing an unparalleled relaxation experience comes with a host of risks and challenges. In order for our team to make Overman the fully immersive, stress-free, extraordinary experience that we have envisioned, it will require time and iteration.

In order to accelerate our progress, we’re working with local passionate, driven and dedicated teams and businesses around Fort Collins. Building Overman is a dream come true and we will do whatever it takes to bring  flotation to Fort Collins.
We anticipate the typical trials and tribulations that come with business and have tried to build that into our timeline goals. To get everything just right and deliver the unmatched experience flotation therapy, we’ll likely have some revisions along the way and keep you updated between every step..Our team is committed to our timeline and constant communication with our backers. As issues arise, we will address and correct them. We’ll be sure to let you know our status at every possible milestone.Our biggest challenge currently is taking our puny life savings and stretching it to its full potential. We've invested $51,000 personal funds among us and will have $259,000 from the banks, but we sill need an additional $30,000 (after campaign fees & perk costs) to make our float center the vision we have been striving  for. 
We are confident that we will be able to overcome this hurdle with the help of our wonderful community and our drive to succeed. The center will open no matter the outcome of our campaign, but in order to make our vision a true success we would love to be able to put in the little extra to take it from good to great.

<p>Let’s face it: having curly hair isn’t always what it’s cracked up to be. Yes, we love our hair but it’s a time sucker and has a mind of its own. Many times you want to give up and either put your hair in a bun or constantly straighten it. Both options have disadvantages; you can grow tired of sporting the bun and straightening your hair can damage it.

Now you can go about your day as you please while CurlyCrown sits comfortably on your head. <br/><br/>CurlyCrown helps you achieve more volume in your hair by lifting the roots away from the scalp as it dries. By diffusing your hair with CurlyCrown, air can flow through with ease. To accomplish this type of volume, we would usually put our head upside while using a blow dryer for a long period of time, tease it, use the hairspray, and aggressively ruffle it around. All of these actions create frizz and take a lot of time and effort. You can now spend less time in the bathroom and more time sleeping, getting ready, or looking after the children. <br/><br/>CurlyCrown is sturdy and comfortable. It is designed to fit most head sizes and is best used on medium and long hair. <br/><br/>You will still have to face the daily challenges of having the perfect hair routine, unwanted or unpredicted weather but at least with CurlyCrown, you can always depend on it to save you time. And maybe it can help you to see your hair as a beautiful attribute and less of a burden.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534761200/nmljp522sezjpfqvoca0.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<img alt=""Ukemi card game"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ukemi.ninja/images/indygogo/game-banner.jpg"" src=""""/><p><br/>Custom card game created for and by the parkour community. The game was created and developed by three practitioners, each with over a decade of experience, to bring you the best and most authentic experience possible. In the main play style of the game, the goal is to get to a set number of points. You achieve points by drawing a combination of cards and successfully replicating the line or movement produced. The more cards you pick the more points you get.</p>
<ul>
<li>Three official game types.</li>
<li>Challenge your friends.</li>
<li>Get warmed up.</li>
<li>Explore new spots.</li>
<li>Create your own choreography.</li>
<li>Invent your own way to play the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each player get the choice of three types of cards;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Movement </strong>(<i>40 cards</i>) - Choose between techniques taken from parkour, tricking and gymnastics.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Condition</strong> (<i>30 cards</i>) - Add variance with rotations, combo's, targeted objects and movement qualities.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Wild Card</strong> (<i>30 cards</i>) - Put your route on hard mode with a Wild Card. This is not for the faint of heart and you can end up in a tree, wearing your friends' shoes or blindfolded.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Blanks </strong>(<i>15</i>) - Each deck comes with 5 blank cards for each card type. This puts you in charge and lets you add your own cards to the game.</p>
<p>The possibilities for different combinations is massive. In fact, we have calculated that each deck allows for <u>over 295 billion possible combinations</u>.</p>
<p>Share your passion with practitioners old and new to celebrate the art of movement.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534761423/o1vtgn7qaradm5wjf9b8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<div>
<img alt=""Card Design"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ukemi.ninja/images/indygogo/design-banner.jpg"" src=""""/><p> </p>
<p>In order to create an easy to understand and relevant experience, we wanted to show the actions from each card with both text and image. The key reason for this was that certain actions, foundational parkour techniques, in particular, use more than one name. For example, arm jump, cat leap, and saut de bras are all the same thing. By having both it will be easier for the player to identify the intention.</p>
<p>The front of card images also gave us the opportunity to promote playing the game in a variety of locations as well as showing a diverse group of people playing the game. One of our fundraising goals is to increase the diversity of the images even further by working with different parkour athletes and photographers. This diversity would come from being able to use more locations and traceurs which would further promote that parkour is for anyone anywhere.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534762369/olpgfxgxqooyg5mifdiv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The inspiration for the general aesthetic came from a mix of calligraphy, fractal patterns and dance notation (drawing of live movement). Using different elements that compliment each other allowed us to create a card game that has distinct sections fit in with an overall aesthetic. This is shown in not only in the different card categories but also in the different card type sub-divisions within the game. To achieve this we have used a mixture of digital graphics, photographs, and drawings. The drawings, used for the multiplier and combo cards, were provided by artist Sally McKay from her collection. Our next step is to bring in Sally to generate images unique to the card game as well as photographers to work with parkour athletes.</p> <p>Physically the product has had a different range of considerations. The game will largely be played outside and as a result, they need to be robust enough to withstand the elements. The first level of protection that comes with the game is a custom tuck box and the second is high-quality gloss finish and top of the range card to ensure they last as long as possible.<br/> </p>

<p>To make the Ukemi card game happen we need to reach £3000. This would produce a base version of the game with minor improvements on the prototype. We don’t want to stop there though and the more we raise the better we can make it. Our fundraising goals to improve the game are -</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ukemi.ninja/images/indygogo/stretch.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<ul>
<li>Move beyond preliminary designs - work with photographers, illustrators, and athletes to give the game a stronger style.</li>
<li>Improve the physical product - we want to use the best materials possible for the cards, tuck box and finish. The more we raise the better quality of card we can produce.</li>
<li>Spread the word - See the game at international events and help us bring Ukemi to schools, parks, and gyms around the world.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<img alt=""Risks &amp; Challenges"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ukemi.ninja/images/indygogo/risks-banner.jpg"" src=""""/><p><br/>Creating a product for an emerging community comes with added risk and challenges. These include having a large enough market, covering expenses, making sure we represent the active Parkour/Freerunning scene and creating a game that keeps up with the constantly progressing community. We aim to overcome this by -</p>
<ul>
<li>Working on a product for traceurs created by traceurs.</li>
<li>Recruiting athletes and coaches to champion our game.</li>
<li>Over 30 years of training, coaching and performing experience in the team.</li>
<li>Making the game scaleable from beginner, to advance to borderline impossible.</li>
</ul>

Custom card game created for and by the parkour community. The game was created and developed by three practitioners, each with over a decade of experience, to bring you the best and most authentic experience possible. In the main play style of the game, the goal is to get to a set number of points. You achieve points by drawing a combination of cards and successfully replicating the line or movement produced. The more cards you pick the more points you get.

Three official game types.
Challenge your friends.
Get warmed up.
Explore new spots.
Create your own choreography.
Invent your own way to play the game.

Each player get the choice of three types of cards;
Movement (40 cards) - Choose between techniques taken from parkour, tricking and gymnastics.
Condition (30 cards) - Add variance with rotations, combo's, targeted objects and movement qualities.
Wild Card (30 cards) - Put your route on hard mode with a Wild Card. This is not for the faint of heart and you can end up in a tree, wearing your friends' shoes or blindfolded.
Blanks (15) - Each deck comes with 5 blank cards for each card type. This puts you in charge and lets you add your own cards to the game.
The possibilities for different combinations is massive. In fact, we have calculated that each deck allows for over 295 billion possible combinations.
Share your passion with practitioners old and new to celebrate the art of movement.

 
 


 
In order to create an easy to understand and relevant experience, we wanted to show the actions from each card with both text and image. The key reason for this was that certain actions, foundational parkour techniques, in particular, use more than one name. For example, arm jump, cat leap, and saut de bras are all the same thing. By having both it will be easier for the player to identify the intention.
The front of card images also gave us the opportunity to promote playing the game in a variety of locations as well as showing a diverse group of people playing the game. One of our fundraising goals is to increase the diversity of the images even further by working with different parkour athletes and photographers. This diversity would come from being able to use more locations and traceurs which would further promote that parkour is for anyone anywhere.

The inspiration for the general aesthetic came from a mix of calligraphy, fractal patterns and dance notation (drawing of live movement). Using different elements that compliment each other allowed us to create a card game that has distinct sections fit in with an overall aesthetic. This is shown in not only in the different card categories but also in the different card type sub-divisions within the game. To achieve this we have used a mixture of digital graphics, photographs, and drawings. The drawings, used for the multiplier and combo cards, were provided by artist Sally McKay from her collection. Our next step is to bring in Sally to generate images unique to the card game as well as photographers to work with parkour athletes. Physically the product has had a different range of considerations. The game will largely be played outside and as a result, they need to be robust enough to withstand the elements. The first level of protection that comes with the game is a custom tuck box and the second is high-quality gloss finish and top of the range card to ensure they last as long as possible. 


Ukemi is at the prototype stage. We want to bring the community in more by accessing photographers, artists, and designers with a passion for Parkour and movement. To share Ukemi with as many people as possible we need -

Initial production costs
Top athletes and coaches for the images
Parkour photographers
A dance illustrator
Marketing costs

Want to get involved? Here's what's up for grabs:
Boost (£5) - We play a line of Ukemi for you.
Frontier (£10) - First edition pack of cards (£5 off RRP)
Supporter (£25) - First edition pack of cards, poster and sticker pack
Contributor (£100) - First edition pack of cards and your chance to be on a card
Stockist (£200) - Stock the game at your store/gym. Box of Ukemi cards (25) RRP £15 each!
Super Backer (£400) - Box of Ukemi cards (25), poster, sticker pack, be on a card, early access to designs/Game. As a super backer you get an insight into the project.
Angel Investor (£1250) - First edition pack of cards, be on a card, say in final designs, a private day-long seminar for you and up to 8 people anywhere in Europe
 


 

Your contribution will allow us to elevate our project from prototype to production. All money raised will be used to add value to the game and, where possible, spent on artists who have a Parkour or movement practice. This ensures a level of quality that can only come from getting close to the source.

Support your community.
Get involved in a world first.
Innovations - the first ever Parkour card game.

 


 
To make the Ukemi card game happen we need to reach £3000. This would produce a base version of the game with minor improvements on the prototype. We don’t want to stop there though and the more we raise the better we can make it. Our fundraising goals to improve the game are -
 

Move beyond preliminary designs - work with photographers, illustrators, and athletes to give the game a stronger style.
Improve the physical product - we want to use the best materials possible for the cards, tuck box and finish. The more we raise the better quality of card we can produce.
Spread the word - See the game at international events and help us bring Ukemi to schools, parks, and gyms around the world.


 

Creating a product for an emerging community comes with added risk and challenges. These include having a large enough market, covering expenses, making sure we represent the active Parkour/Freerunning scene and creating a game that keeps up with the constantly progressing community. We aim to overcome this by -

Working on a product for traceurs created by traceurs.
Recruiting athletes and coaches to champion our game.
Over 30 years of training, coaching and performing experience in the team.
Making the game scaleable from beginner, to advance to borderline impossible.

 


No cash? No problem there is plenty of ways you can help -

Share our campaign. Parkour largely grew out of the internet, let's make Ukemi do the same!
Send us suggestions on stockists and athletes you want to see try the game.
Have a go! Send us a message and we will draw cards for you from the prototype for you to try a line.

The BonBaby app can also monitor multi-dimensional growth index, generate an exclusive growth curve and enable technological supervision of your child’s growth.
We truly believe our efforts can lay a foundation for your baby's lifelong health.

 
 
 
   We are a technology-driven company devoted to women's and children's digital health. Now in our fourth year, we have established customer trust in our products and have a promising future. We won our first support on Indiegogo for a basal thermometer. Over the next three years, we focused on researching and developing smart hardware and corresponding apps. Our products can be found on Amazon Europe and America sites and have directed 330,000 women to TTC(Try to Conceive). Last year, we entered the field of children’s products and founded the sub-brand of BonBaby. We have already successfully launched our first product in this series, an ear thermometer—Earmo. Parents all over the world want their child to have a healthy body. A healthy child is, for example, better able to participate in sport. The healthier a child is, the more likely they are to receive positive attention from society. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) shows that in 2016, over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5–19 were overweight or obese. Growing up is an irreversible process, and regular tracking is essential to identify growth problems in children. If you miss the right time, and treatment is delayed, it can be difficult to make up for it.   To address this issue, our team has developed a personal growth manager for babies, replacing the traditional methods of measuring and recording height and weight with a new solution for the Internet era.Our aim is to be able to predict children's health as efficiently as adult health, through effective management systems.   Compare your baby’s personal growth with that of children all over the world. To check the growth and symmetry of your baby, just compare their growth curve with the reference curve provided by WHO.The app would give advice on growth according to our smart algorithm analysis.  Neutral butter-yellow and with a high brightness and adorable bear shape, BonBaby Gro is not only a baby monitor, but also a playmate for your child.   All the corners and edges are rounded, and large feet ensure stability, so your child can measure themselves safely.  
 Rotate the level ruler, and the bear’s eyes on the height scale will greet your baby as a signal of the start of measurement. And kids can step on the scale, which has the bear's footprints. All of this provides a reassuring sense of ritual for your child.Because measurement is no longer a task assigned by parents, children are more willing to participate in it. Winning a 2018 Red Dot Product Award has given us welcome recognition. Also, children taking part in our beta test expressed their love for the product.       The ruler is equipped with 75 bright LED bulbs, making the mode of presentation highly distinctive. The ultra-low power consumption Bluetooth chip makes the transmission of data faster, and the battery life is one year. A highly sensitive ultra-red sensor makes the ruler accurate to a precision of 0.2cm.  The scale selects ultra-white tempered glass, which is tough yet light. The powerful sensor allows accurate measurement. The rounded corners and edges make measuring comfortable. Large feet stabilize the scale, making it harder to roll over.          We are Bongmi, the creator of BonBaby Gro, a smart baby-growth tracker. In 2016, we launched our Femometer Indiegogo campaign, which raised $92,730 (over 240% funded). Our second Indiegogo campaign, in 2017, for Earmo, raising $40,512.

There is no manual input needed. Thanks to its highly accurate sensors and patented technology, Popit Sense monitors your medication activity in real-time and triggers an alarm ONLY if you or a loved one is about to forget the pill.All you have to do is clip it on to the pill sheet and there is one thing less to remember! Popit Sense works with different pill sheet types and reduces missed pills by over 80%.Our team has been working on Popit Sense for over 2 years, collaborating with leading hospitals in Finland.WHO IS IT FOR?Popit Sense helps everyone. You can use it with different types of pills that come in blisters. These include medications for depression, anxiety, cholesterol, blood pressure, thyroid, type 2 diabetes, ADD/ADHD, asthma, allergy, insomnia, etc.You can also use it to keep track of how family members have been taking their pills. Popit Sense can send out a notification to a pre-defined caregiver if pills have not been taken according to plan. Get piece of mind knowing medication works as it should for your loved ones.  WATCH OUR DEMO VIDEO TO SEE HOW IT WORKS  WHY POPIT?Remembering to take the daily pill can be difficult when you have a lot of things going on in your life. It is easy to download a reminder app or simply use the smartphone alarm, but they do not take actual pill consumption into account nor are particularly smart.Our extensive survey with 500 people using daily medication showed that as many as 12% of patients using a smartphone alarm had missed more than one pill during the last month alone. This number is likely optimistic, as nearly 90% of non-adherent people usually report that they are adherent.How many times have you dismissed the alarm just to find yourself wondering if you took that pill after all? This is why we created Popit Sense. So that you or a loved one wouldn’t have to miss pills and that medication could work as intended! COMPARISON EXAMPLE: Birth Control Pills1 IN 10 GET PREGNANT WHILE ON THE PILLBirth control pills are an effective contraceptive method, which in perfect use have a failure rate of approximately 0.3%. A well-documented fact however is that occasional forgetfulness rapidly increases the failure rate by nearly 30x, up to 9%*Popit helps you get from 9% closer to 0.3%, where you should be. * Trussell J. Contraceptive failure in the United States. Contraception. 2011;83(5):397-404. doi:10.1016/j.contraception.2011.01.021. WHAT THE PRESS IS SAYING TESTIMONIALS FROM OUR TESTERS BENEFITSAUTOMATIC DETECTION - NO NEED FOR MANUAL INPUTWith the help of Artificial Intelligence, Popit Sense automatically detects when you’ve taken a pill. There is no manual input needed on the app or the device to keep track of daily pills. You simply take your medications and Popit Sense records the activity for you to see in the application. NO INCONVENIENT ALERTSPopit Sense isn't another alarm notification that you'll learn to ignore. To take better care of you, it is connected to your actual pills, so it notifies automatically when you or a loved one didn't take a pill. In personal use it has the added benefit of forming the habit of taking your pills at the exact same time every day.Popit Sense can detect when you took the pill with the help of patented technology and three different sensors.WORKS WITH VARIOUS PILL AND BLISTER TYPESPopit Sense will work with different types of medications and pill blisters. The application and device are usable for example for blood pressure and cholesterol pill, anti-depressants, thyroid medication, allergy medications etc. The packaging just needs to have about 1/4 - 3/8"" (or 6-9mm) of free space on the side for a secure attachment.Initially the app will also have special content and features for birth control pills. MAKE SURE MEDICATION WORKS AS INTENDEDMissed pills do not work. For example with birth control pills forgetting even once a month can raise chances of pregnancy.

<p>La historia detrás del método (<i>My personal Story)</i></p>
<ul>
<li>En el 2007, casi me muero por lo eNfermo que estaba! Siendo en Director de Nuevos negocios de una importante empresa de Televisión; produje cientos de conciertos y programas, tenía una oficina de Management de artistas, un estudio de grabación profesional  y una exitosa empresa de producción de eventos. <i>Mientras triunfaba por fuera, me estaba matando por dentro</i>.  Los excesos en la comida y la bebida; mi vida desorganizada y la depresión que acompaña al éxito económico cuando los valores están mal fundamentados fueron solo algunas de las cosas que necesité <i>sanar</i> para <strong>RENACER!</strong> Hoy 10 años después de haber trabajado y estudiado por todo el mundo, estamos listos para compartir este sistema en un libro y un APP, en una serie de videos,  talleres y retiros que pueden salvar a muchas más personas.</li>
<li><i>In 2007, I was a successful TV New Business Director, Producer and Artist manager, creating one of the top production companies in Mexico and produce events, shows and content all over the world. Within that time, with all of that ""success"", I suffered from server depression, food and alcohol disorders. The stress I was unable to handle was killing me—physically, emotionally and mentally. After more than 2 years traveling the world and working on my self, I began to create this system (Renacer en 90 Días) that can help others in the same situation. Today, 10 years later, this system has been proven and transcribed into a book, a series of short videos, an iOS APP, and a one-on-one and group coaching system that has the potential to save the lives of many others. </i></li>

La historia detrás del método (My personal Story)

En el 2007, casi me muero por lo eNfermo que estaba! Siendo en Director de Nuevos negocios de una importante empresa de Televisión; produje cientos de conciertos y programas, tenía una oficina de Management de artistas, un estudio de grabación profesional  y una exitosa empresa de producción de eventos. Mientras triunfaba por fuera, me estaba matando por dentro.  Los excesos en la comida y la bebida; mi vida desorganizada y la depresión que acompaña al éxito económico cuando los valores están mal fundamentados fueron solo algunas de las cosas que necesité sanar para RENACER! Hoy 10 años después de haber trabajado y estudiado por todo el mundo, estamos listos para compartir este sistema en un libro y un APP, en una serie de videos,  talleres y retiros que pueden salvar a muchas más personas.
In 2007, I was a successful TV New Business Director, Producer and Artist manager, creating one of the top production companies in Mexico and produce events, shows and content all over the world. Within that time, with all of that ""success"", I suffered from server depression, food and alcohol disorders. The stress I was unable to handle was killing me—physically, emotionally and mentally. After more than 2 years traveling the world and working on my self, I began to create this system (Renacer en 90 Días) that can help others in the same situation. Today, 10 years later, this system has been proven and transcribed into a book, a series of short videos, an iOS APP, and a one-on-one and group coaching system that has the potential to save the lives of many others. 

 


EL DINERO RECAUDADO NOS VA A PERMITIR PUBLICAR EL LIBRO  TERMINAR EL DISEÑO DEL APP, EDITAR LOS CONTENIDOS EN VIDEO Y SEGUIR CREANDO RECETAS DE COCINA, EJERCICIOS Y TALLERES PARA TODOS LOS QUE LO NECESITAN REALMENTE.
THIS CAMPAIGN WILL SUPPLY THE FUNDS NEEDED TO EDIT AND PRINT THE BOOK, FINISH THE APP AND CONTINUE CREATING THE SUPPORTIVE VIDEOS, ALL WHILE CRAFTING  AND LAUNCHING THE WORKSHOPS, RETREATS, AND CONFERENCES WORLDWIDE.

 


Mi historia se que es la de MILES de personas que NO SABEN COMO y que tal vez han perdido las ganas de vivir, de mejorar,  de verse y  de sentirse mejor.  R90D.TV realmente te dice como pero mas importante te ayuda a encontrar el PARA QUE? mediante cientos de ejercicios, meditaciones, visualizaciones y videos cortos.  
My story is sadly very common and we create this system to help everybody who needs to remember HOW and most important WHY they are here. We use more than 100 meditations, exercises, cooking tips, in a fun short videos format that make this easy to follow and to learn and apply.

 

 QUE NECESITAMOS /What We Need


NECESITAMOS 28,400 DOLARES para terminar las ediciones de los videos, el diseño e implementación del APP y la creación de los primeros KITS de R90D.TV que vamos a utilizar con las personas que decidan unirse al sistema.
I NEED 28,400 USD to finish the book formatting and translation, video edits and APP developers fee and programming. In addition, the money will goes towards creating and printing the initial batch of ""welcome kits"" and VIP packages for a select few as an R90D grant, offering need to those who cannot afford, but will save their life from this program, and your investment.

 

Este sistema va a cambiar la vida de muchas personas gracias a la forma en la que se comparte en redes sociales, mediante el APP y con los testimoniales de cada uno. Al apoyar la campaña no solo recibes el LIBRO y el acceso al APP vas a formar parte del grupo VIP para poder compartir, opinar, comentar y ayudarnos a servir a más personas  en todo el mundo, de una manera más eficiente!
This system will change thousands of lives because is designed to be shared as a community, support system and amongst peers. Available to all, exclusive to no one or country, the app will be available anywhere. When you support this campaign you are getting the book but also the opportunity to be part of the VIP GROUP to share, comment and most importantly, YOU WILL HELP R90D to grow and be able to serve more people around the world.
 

En R90D lo único peligro es no hacer nada.
El sistema que creamos necesita seguirse día a día y por lo que aprendimos en el pasado el APP va a permitir a la gente estar conectada y recibir los mensajes, ejercicios y meditaciones en el tiempo y la forma necesarios para cumplir sus propias metas. Necesito de la ayuda de todos para que cada grupo se conforme y se motive a seguir adelante—JUNTOS es la palabra clave! Si crees que este sistema no es para ti, AYUDANOS A COMPARTIRLO, seguramente alguien cerca lo necesita!

Slipping off track? Give yourself a shake  Backed by science, proven by resultsWhen you eat food, your body breaks it down into sugars such as glucose. Your cells use this glucose for energy, and if it isn’t used up then it gets stored as fat. When you don’t eat food for a set period of time each day, the glucose in your body is used up, so your body starts to burn your fat. This process of burning fat is known as ketosis.Numerous studies show that intermittent fasting is an effective weight loss method. There are a variety of techniques including alternate-day fasting, 5:2 (two days fasting per week), and 6/18 (18 hours fasting per day). Our app assists you whichever option you choose.  What people are saying about FitTo? ""I love that FitTo gives me a shake when I should NOT eat and will remind when to have my meal. The app constantly provides motivation to stay on track and to achieve my goals.""JohnsonPersonal Trainer ""FitTo has given me a new a way of staying consistent with my diet plans. The FitTo app provides instant feedback and progress on how I am doing.""DwayneRetail Manager ""FitTo is very easy and simple to use.

When his roommate, Wick Taylor was brushing his teeth with a new Sonic powered Toothbrush given to him by his sister that just graduated from dental hygiene school. Craig was brushing his teeth with a traditional soft-bristled toothbrush while his roommate used his fancy new toothbrush that beeped every 30 seconds. This new Sonic Toothbrush was designed to beep every 30 seconds for a total of 2 minutes because the mouth can be divided into 4 quadrants, and each quadrant should be brushed for 30 seconds when using a Sonic Powered Toothbrush. Craig thought there had to be a better way.  And there is! So Craig began developing the EZ Teethbrush™. After over 10 years of Research and Development, testing prototypes, countless hours, thousands and thousands of dollars invested,  the EZ Teethbrush is ready for the World. Prior to the release of the <strong>EZ Teethbrush™</strong> Craig worked in the Medical Sector for several years working with durable medical equipment and pharmaceuticals.  Craig transitioned to a career working for the Department of Defense and even worked for DCMA's <strong>NASA Product Operations</strong> working with rocket motors as an Industrial Specialist. Applying what he learned about the manufacturing of rockets, to the manufacturing of a Sonic Powered Teethbrush. He successfully blended science and producibility.  </p><figcaption><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548649979/vuuhapsteg0xo3ewfp2w.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brett Ballingham </strong>became fascinated with finding a more effective way to brush during his first year of dental school, his dad who was suffering from debilitating Parkinson’s disease and thus was struggling to brush his teeth with conventional methods challenged him to find a way to help him clean his teeth. Brett set out to find a better way. In his search to make a better toothbrush, he was introduced to Craig by mutual friends in the dental community. Together they collaborated and made changes to the mouthpiece culminating with the EZ Teethbrush.</p>
<p>Dr. Brett Ballingham graduated top of his class at Roseman University in Salt Lake City Utah after which he completed a one-year advanced education program at Arizona School of Dentistry with an emphasis in dental work on patients with special needs and children. He has over ten years experience in dentistry.</p>

The innovative EZ Teethbrush™ uses cutting-edge technology to safely and efficiently clean all teeth and gums, practically eliminating the extra time, and human error often experienced with traditional brushing and over-brushing.    Why The EZ Teethbrush™ Is The Perfect Solution Save 75% of the time it takes to brush.  Perfect for anyone that doesn't enjoy or has difficulty brushing their teeth for two minutes, twice a day. Studies show that most people don't brush for the full two minutes and much of the population only brushes once a day.  Did You Know Nearly Half Of Adults Have Gum Disease?According the CDC, nearly half of the adults in the USA have gum disease. In 2001 the Guisness Book of World Records declared Gum disease as the #1 Disease in The World affecting all of man-kind.  
Who is the EZ Teethbrush™ Designed for?It's for ANYONE that doesn't like to brush their teeth and especially those that don't brush for two minutes, twice a day.  Adults, Kids and people with special needs can also benefit from the EZ Teethbrush.  The EZ Teethbrush design is also great for people with limited dexterity.  Don't just take our word for it! ""I recommend the EZ Teethbrush™ to my patients that don't brush for two minutes, twice a day. ""  - Dr. Kody Mund DMD -""I would recommend the EZ Teethbrush™ for anyone that doesn't brush for two minutes, twice a day, and for patients with special needs"" - Dr. Nick Spendlove DMD -   Travel KitCarbon Fiber PU Travel Kit In 2006, a fresh-faced, Utah-raised, good-to-know-ya fella named Craig Mock, was attending Western Wyoming Community College on a Wrestling scholarship. When his roommate, Wick Taylor was brushing his teeth with a new Sonic powered Toothbrush given to him by his sister that just graduated from dental hygiene school. Craig was brushing his teeth with a traditional soft-bristled toothbrush while his roommate used his fancy new toothbrush that beeped every 30 seconds. This new Sonic Toothbrush was designed to beep every 30 seconds for a total of 2 minutes because the mouth can be divided into 4 quadrants, and each quadrant should be brushed for 30 seconds when using a Sonic Powered Toothbrush. Craig thought there had to be a better way.  And there is! So Craig began developing the EZ Teethbrush™. After over 10 years of Research and Development, testing prototypes, countless hours, thousands and thousands of dollars invested,  the EZ Teethbrush is ready for the World. Prior to the release of the EZ Teethbrush™ Craig worked in the Medical Sector for several years working with durable medical equipment and pharmaceuticals.  Craig transitioned to a career working for the Department of Defense and even worked for DCMA's NASA Product Operations working with rocket motors as an Industrial Specialist. Applying what he learned about the manufacturing of rockets, to the manufacturing of a Sonic Powered Teethbrush. He successfully blended science and producibility.  
Dr. Brett Ballingham became fascinated with finding a more effective way to brush during his first year of dental school, his dad who was suffering from debilitating Parkinson’s disease and thus was struggling to brush his teeth with conventional methods challenged him to find a way to help him clean his teeth. Brett set out to find a better way. In his search to make a better toothbrush, he was introduced to Craig by mutual friends in the dental community. Together they collaborated and made changes to the mouthpiece culminating with the EZ Teethbrush.
Dr. Brett Ballingham graduated top of his class at Roseman University in Salt Lake City Utah after which he completed a one-year advanced education program at Arizona School of Dentistry with an emphasis in dental work on patients with special needs and children. He has over ten years experience in dentistry.
Dr. Ballingham can be found on social media at Brett_Ballingham on Facebook and Instagram and welcomes any questions or concerns or feedback you have about the EZ Teethbrush.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">DreamOn is an advanced form of entrainment, the process of your internal organs copying and matching the stimuli from an external force.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">While most entrainment research has used visual and auditory signals like flashing lights or alarms, DreamOn relies on paced signals that travel through your extensive neural network to alter the calibration of our natural brainwaves. The persistent rhythm of the signal locks step with our own rhythmic brainwaves and soothes them down to those needed for deep relaxation.</p>

In the beginning stages of sleep, your body feels a need to rest and relax. Brainwaves begin to slow as alertness relaxes and the mind drifts into slumber. The body’s need for slow wave sleep is clear, as the very first phase of sleep is known as slow wave non-REM sleep, where the rest-inducing deepest brain waves are recorded. Transitioning from the relatively fast waves of wakefulness to the slow waves of sleep is problematic for most insomnia complainers.

Experience a more restful sleep, faster.  Simply and safely enjoy a quality drug-free sleep that leaves you feeling happier, thinking more clearly, more resilient to stress, and in control of your emotions.     
Each state of mind (awake, light sleep, deep sleep, etc.) has a unique signature known as a BRAIN WAVE PATTERN.
By emitting the low-frequency signal of deep sleep, DreamOn encourages your brain to REPLICATE THAT SIGNAL, sending you into deeper sleep, faster.

DreamOn uses a completely natural, tactile approach that leavesyou feeling refreshed, more focused and with a clear mind. Say goodbyeto all those unnecessary sleep aids. 

 
 

A chronic lack of sleep can take a toll on your overall brain health.DreamOn helps you practice healthy sleep habits that have beenshown to reduce stress and increase focus.

 
 

Our guided meditations can help with night wakings,common insomnia and other sleep ailments.
       
Scientists have known since the 1930s that we are able to coax brainwaves into different rhythms.

DreamOn is an advanced form of entrainment, the process of your internal organs copying and matching the stimuli from an external force.
While most entrainment research has used visual and auditory signals like flashing lights or alarms, DreamOn relies on paced signals that travel through your extensive neural network to alter the calibration of our natural brainwaves. The persistent rhythm of the signal locks step with our own rhythmic brainwaves and soothes them down to those needed for deep relaxation.
 There are several stages of sleep, defined by the type of waves the brain creates for each. In the beginning stages of sleep, your body feels a need to rest and relax. Brainwaves begin to slow as alertness relaxes and the mind drifts into slumber. The body’s need for slow wave sleep is clear, as the very first phase of sleep is known as slow wave non-REM sleep, where the rest-inducing deepest brain waves are recorded. Transitioning from the relatively fast waves of wakefulness to the slow waves of sleep is problematic for most insomnia complainers. DreamOn is designed to assist in that transition.  Over the past five years research has intensified to develop the optimal configuration for DreamOn's comfort and effectiveness.       QUALITY OF SLEEP: self-reported improvements across respondents. 
  

 

 

 
 
 

 

Whether your kids need help sticking to a bedtime or getting a full night’s rest (yes, one without waking you up multiple times), DreamOn can aid in improving their sleeping habits too.


 
 
 

 

Poor quality and low quantity of sleep can lead to chronic health problems such as heart disease, diabetes, depression, and high blood pressure. It might also lead to poor decision making or difficulty in thinking, reacting, or learning.
Research shows that after losing  1-2 hours per night over several nights of sleep, you function as if you had missed a full one or two nights of sleep. That means less productivity at work, school, and in the long run, even a decrease in longevity.
 


 
 
 

 

Most sleep wearables are bulky and uncomfortable. DreamOnwas built to be discreet and attractive.

 

 
 

 



 

DreamOn's companion app lets you personalize your device experience. Sleep tracking, sleep tips, guided meditations, and soundscapes are just a few of its features to help you relax. DreamOn's companion App is not required for use.

<p><i>Hi, I'm Jacqueline Fountain, President and Co-Owner of URO-GRIP
Technology Inc.</i></p>
<p><i>I had a very
common problem… a problem that all women share. When I had a doctor’s
appointment in April 2013, I knew it was time for that dreaded urine
sample, but I persevered and got through it.  Urinating on your hands, on
toilets seats, and all over the place is not very pleasant. 
At that moment, I thought to myself that there has to be a better way. 
After pondering for several weeks, it hit me… a device that can attach directly
to the specimen cup. It was then that the
Uro-Grip urine specimen device was born. I shared my idea with my
friend, Raymond, who immediately saw my vision as well. Together, we
experimented with several designs and finally came up with a revolutionary
product. This device has a wider surface area, a handle for easier use, and
screws directly on to the specimen cup.</i></p>
<p><i>To make a long
story short, we decided to create a company to market and distribute the Uro-Grip. This device is our initial product
offering and we're looking forward to developing other
unique products in the near future.  </i></p>
<p><i><b>Uro-Grip</b> is coming to a doctor's office near you!  </i></p>

Hi, I'm Jacqueline Fountain, President and Co-Owner of URO-GRIP
Technology Inc.
I had a very
common problem… a problem that all women share. When I had a doctor’s
appointment in April 2013, I knew it was time for that dreaded urine
sample, but I persevered and got through it.  Urinating on your hands, on
toilets seats, and all over the place is not very pleasant. 
At that moment, I thought to myself that there has to be a better way. 
After pondering for several weeks, it hit me… a device that can attach directly
to the specimen cup. It was then that the
Uro-Grip urine specimen device was born. I shared my idea with my
friend, Raymond, who immediately saw my vision as well. Together, we
experimented with several designs and finally came up with a revolutionary
product. This device has a wider surface area, a handle for easier use, and
screws directly on to the specimen cup.
To make a long
story short, we decided to create a company to market and distribute the Uro-Grip. This device is our initial product
offering and we're looking forward to developing other
unique products in the near future.  
Uro-Grip is coming to a doctor's office near you!  

                    

                                         








Uro-Grip is a Patent Pending, distinctive pear shaped specimen assistant for a single
use urine sample collection. The device is intended for females, but anyone can use it!  Uro-Grip
becomes leak proof once screwed onto a specimen cup and allows for any overage
to be discarded; this device alleviates contamination of the urine sample with
its extended handle and wide surface.  The wider surface also allows you
to hold the device more closely to the vaginal area to prevent sprinkles and
splatters on your hands and toilet seat. Uro-Grip is sterilized and
packaged in a clean room environment and latex free for those with skin
allergies. 
Let's spread the word about Uro-Grip!

<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Threat</h3>
<div>
<p>1-3 million serious infections (HAIs) occur in patients at nursing homes and skilled-nursing facilities each year, resulting in $673 million in healthcare costs and as any as 380,000 annual deaths (<i>CDC, HHS</i>). Additionally, HAIs are a frequent cause of transfer from sub-acute to acute care hospitals and could account for more than 150,000 hospitalizations (<i>HHS</i>).</p>
<p>Dangerous germs persist on surfaces long after a patient has discharged. Some pathogens can survive for months in the inanimate environment and contaminated surfaces increase the risk of infections from MRSA, influenza, norovirus, Clostridium difficile and many drug-resistant microorganisms -- especially for the immunocompromised and elderly. </p>
<p>Currently, private insurance and the Medicare do not pay for advanced disinfection technology and infection prevention education for Skilled-Nursing/Long-term care and At-home care agencies. The Acute care centers, such as, hospitals, endure large penalties for infections that patients may acquire in these facilities up to 90 days after the patient is discharged.   </p>
<p>Owners of these sub-acute facilities often lack the financial resources or desire to improve the environment to ensure healthier patients.  Additionally,  their staffs often lack important infection prevention knowledge that could reduce infections and the persistence of superbugs in their facilities.</p>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>The Solution</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>CSGI’s prevention education breaks the chain of infection by targeting systemic transmission vectors within a medical facility, including both clinical and non - clinical space. Our Services include:</p>

<li>Identifying Nursing Facility specific weaknesses </li>

1-3 million serious infections (HAIs) occur in patients at nursing homes and skilled-nursing facilities each year, resulting in $673 million in healthcare costs and as any as 380,000 annual deaths (CDC, HHS). Additionally, HAIs are a frequent cause of transfer from sub-acute to acute care hospitals and could account for more than 150,000 hospitalizations (HHS).
Dangerous germs persist on surfaces long after a patient has discharged. Some pathogens can survive for months in the inanimate environment and contaminated surfaces increase the risk of infections from MRSA, influenza, norovirus, Clostridium difficile and many drug-resistant microorganisms -- especially for the immunocompromised and elderly. 
Currently, private insurance and the Medicare do not pay for advanced disinfection technology and infection prevention education for Skilled-Nursing/Long-term care and At-home care agencies. The Acute care centers, such as, hospitals, endure large penalties for infections that patients may acquire in these facilities up to 90 days after the patient is discharged.   
Owners of these sub-acute facilities often lack the financial resources or desire to improve the environment to ensure healthier patients.  Additionally,  their staffs often lack important infection prevention knowledge that could reduce infections and the persistence of superbugs in their facilities.


The Solution 

CSGI’s prevention education breaks the chain of infection by targeting systemic transmission vectors within a medical facility, including both clinical and non - clinical space. Our Services include:

Infection prevention and control basics
Identifying Nursing Facility specific weaknesses 
Isolation fundamentals 
PPE basics 
Prevention of Cross - Contamination 
Proper Guidelines on Containing Specific Organisms 
Information on current Infection Control Protocols
Application of UV-C disinfection technology
Providing a cleaner, safer environment

<p><b>This is tough stuff</b>. When building an app for young people, especially young people with mental health concerns, it’s so important that we <b>test and test and test </b>to make sure that not only is the experience engaging and useful, but also one that is as safe as technically possible.</p>
<p>During the past year and a half  we at Psych Media have researched and interviewed <b>mental health experts, teenagers, and agencies, companies, and organizations </b>that focus on adolescent mental health. We've had meetings with top government agencies and politicians. We've spoken to numerous <b>app developers</b> and <b>user experiences experts</b>. We've met with <b>privacy attorneys</b> and <b>cyber security activists</b>. </p>
<p>From the concept to the mock ups and video we have created, we have gotten <b>enthusiastic and positive feedback </b>from all of them.  </p>
<p>In order to get buy-in from the insurance companies that will ultimately fund the bulk of the subscriptions, we need to be able to show them a deeply tested and proven product, with irrefutable evidence that when teenagers use psych.E regularly, their outcomes will improve.</p>
<p>With the funds we raise with this Indiegogo Campaign, we can work with an impressive team of developers, privacy experts, and mental health specialists to bring this dream to reality.</p>

Is In Crisis.

We're creating an app to help fix that.www.psychmedia.net

psych.E is a mobile app that helps teenagers take control of their own mental health care by using the visual & social media tools they live by. It gives them a safe, anonymous community, videos to educate and inform, and tracking tools to stay engaged with their own care. 


Problem
Current modes of adolescent mental health care aren't working. 20% of American teenagers have a diagnosable mental health disorder. That's 1 in 5!  But only about a third of those who need help get any treatment at all. And even though more than $8.9 billion is spent on mental health care for Americans under 18 each year, most available treatments are inadequate, ineffective, and outdated. 
Solution
Build tool to engage young people in their own mental health care. Have that tool exist on the mobile devices where they spend most of their time. Actively engaged patients consistently have better outcomes and can cut costs up to 21% (source: Health Affairs/RWJF policy brief). 

There are numerous UX and design changes that will be implemented, but the above video of our rough mockups will give an idea of the overall concept and features.


How It Works






What We Need
We already created a rough concept of mockups to demonstrate some of the features that the app will have. The response has been tremendous. Now we need the funds to enhance the user experience and the design, and then bring it to life.
The $100K we are raising will go towards creating a beautifully designed prototype of the app, ample user surveys, legal fees, along with sample versions of educational videos. 

A well designed prototype will allow us to test the concept and get real world feedback from teenagers so that we can build the most powerful and effective platform possible. With that feedback, we can then raise additional funds.

Additional funding would go towards developing a minimal viable product (MVP) of the app to have a robust product for beta testing, as well as additional consultant and legal fees, outreach, content creation and partnerships.

This is tough stuff. When building an app for young people, especially young people with mental health concerns, it’s so important that we test and test and test to make sure that not only is the experience engaging and useful, but also one that is as safe as technically possible.
During the past year and a half  we at Psych Media have researched and interviewed mental health experts, teenagers, and agencies, companies, and organizations that focus on adolescent mental health. We've had meetings with top government agencies and politicians. We've spoken to numerous app developers and user experiences experts. We've met with privacy attorneys and cyber security activists. 
From the concept to the mock ups and video we have created, we have gotten enthusiastic and positive feedback from all of them.  
In order to get buy-in from the insurance companies that will ultimately fund the bulk of the subscriptions, we need to be able to show them a deeply tested and proven product, with irrefutable evidence that when teenagers use psych.E regularly, their outcomes will improve.
With the funds we raise with this Indiegogo Campaign, we can work with an impressive team of developers, privacy experts, and mental health specialists to bring this dream to reality.

Other Ways You Can Help
Your support also includes sharing this campaign everywhere and with everyone you know. Even if you can't contribute a dime (and we totally get that!), simply helping to get the word out is enormously helpful.


Tweet all about it! Make some noise!
It's super easy to spread the word. Just look on the upper left side of the page for all the share tools Indiegogo provides.
If you know of any teenagers who might be interested in joining our Teen Advisory Board or participating in feedback surveys, please let us know.

And that's all there is to it.",10.0,2,"1 Campaign

</p><p><b>What is the issue?</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>There
are more than 60 million healthcare workers in the world and English is the
dominant language of communication in Medicine; this is obviously particularly
true in the USA, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Because
of the movement of doctors between countries, 20-30% of the doctors in these
most popular countries are International Medical Graduates (IMGs) from outside
the respective country.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>It is
this group of doctors who most frequently have difficulties in the use of the    English
language in the workplace.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>There
are similar language challenges in all of the disciplines allied to Medicine, such as Nursing, Osteopathy, Physiotherapy, Pharmacology etc.    </p>
<p>In our
experience as native UK trained doctors working side by side with our
colleagues, we see how hard our fellow doctors are working to overcome
linguistic difficulties. We see the same effort when doctors come to us for
Medical English lessons. </p>

<p>As
doctors and medical educationalists we are privileged to help medical students
and doctors reach their full potential. We are particularly happy facilitate their achievement of
career ambitions through improved education. Accordingly, as a group of doctors
we have published five books in four years via Academic Medical Press
(<a href=""http://www.academicmedicalpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.academicmedicalpress.com</a>) which is part of a charity designed to supply
underserved areas in medicine and to further medical education. </p>
<p>In
our collective experience we understand that the best people to teach
doctors <i>authentic</i> Medical English are
<i>other doctors</i>. We are pleased to
state that the major advantage of our book over books in the marketplace is that
it will be written <i>by doctors</i> who are
also qualified in English teaching. Even more helpfully, the book will include the
following:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>A section covering history and examination that is pertinent to all the
medical and    surgical subspecialities.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>An accessible and comprehensive glossary of all medical abbreviations.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>A section covering idioms/colloquialisms used by doctors and patients.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Key differences between American and British Medical English.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Medical English for common medical scenarios.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>A section to improve medical writing.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Sections on technical English relevant to medicine.</p>
<p>Modern
medicine is delivered through multidisciplinary cooperation which means that
the different healthcare professionals must communicate effectively with each
other. So our book will reflect this shared language. Accordingly <i>Comprehensive Medical English</i> will have
real value for doctors, nurses, osteopaths, physiotherapists, pharmacists and
all allied healthcare groups.</p>

are more than 60 million healthcare workers in the world and English is the
dominant language of communication in Medicine; this is obviously particularly
true in the USA, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand. 
· 
Because
of the movement of doctors between countries, 20-30% of the doctors in these
most popular countries are International Medical Graduates (IMGs) from outside
the respective country.
· 
It is
this group of doctors who most frequently have difficulties in the use of the    English
language in the workplace.
· 
There
are similar language challenges in all of the disciplines allied to Medicine, such as Nursing, Osteopathy, Physiotherapy, Pharmacology etc.    
In our
experience as native UK trained doctors working side by side with our
colleagues, we see how hard our fellow doctors are working to overcome
linguistic difficulties. We see the same effort when doctors come to us for
Medical English lessons. 
What we would
like to do is provide much needed help by creating a modern, comprehensive and
accessible resource in the form of our Medical English book. 
What we need.
We are looking for £40,000 to help fund the production of our
Comprehensive Medical English book. This money will go towards helping us to support the writing, design,
publication and advertising of this book for an international audience of
healthcare workers.                                                                                                              
Our previous book, Steele’s Guide to Scientific, Technical and Medical
English has provided us with part of the template for a more comprehensive
book. We plan to collaborate with fellow healthcare staff to publish a
UK/US edition in July 2018. In line with the requests of our students there
will also be an electronic version of the book.

What you get.
As well as contributing to longterm improvements in healthcare in your country, community
and family, we also offer the following rewards: 

· 
Free
copies of the electronic book.
· 
Free
copies of the signed hardcopy book.
· 
Free
Skype Medical English lessons.
· 
Free
weekend IELTS course.
· 
Written
thanks by name in the acknowledgements section.
· 
The
opportunity to name and commemorate/remember your friends, family or          any other
nominated individual.
· 
The
opportunity to become an editor of a respected medical text.
· 
The
opportunity to become a co-author a Medical English book.


Why this book?
The co-authors
Dr Steele and Dr Khara have over 27 years experience of healthcare including the National
Health Service, Private Hospitals and Medical School teaching/training.  Moreover, Dr Steele is one the UK’s leading
experts in Medical English (www.eliteacademicmedical.com) and has enjoyed
teaching Medical English to doctors from the UK and abroad since the 1990s.
                                                                         Academic Medical Press               
As
doctors and medical educationalists we are privileged to help medical students
and doctors reach their full potential. We are particularly happy facilitate their achievement of
career ambitions through improved education. Accordingly, as a group of doctors
we have published five books in four years via Academic Medical Press
(www.academicmedicalpress.com) which is part of a charity designed to supply
underserved areas in medicine and to further medical education. 
In
our collective experience we understand that the best people to teach
doctors authentic Medical English are
other doctors. We are pleased to
state that the major advantage of our book over books in the marketplace is that
it will be written by doctors who are
also qualified in English teaching. Even more helpfully, the book will include the
following:
· 
A section covering history and examination that is pertinent to all the
medical and    surgical subspecialities.
· 
An accessible and comprehensive glossary of all medical abbreviations.
· 
A section covering idioms/colloquialisms used by doctors and patients.
· 
Key differences between American and British Medical English.
· 
Medical English for common medical scenarios.
· 
A section to improve medical writing.
· 
Sections on technical English relevant to medicine.
Modern
medicine is delivered through multidisciplinary cooperation which means that
the different healthcare professionals must communicate effectively with each
other. So our book will reflect this shared language. Accordingly Comprehensive Medical English will have
real value for doctors, nurses, osteopaths, physiotherapists, pharmacists and
all allied healthcare groups.

Introducing UBALLN® Basketball




 

While
 the ability to connect with anyone, anywhere, focused to a 
specific interest, exists thru numerous social networks, you'd 
be hard pressed to find the mother-of-all pickup basketball networks.The
 way 
we connect with each other has evolved. Yet everyday hoopers still have
 to rely on traditional means – text messages, emails, phone calls – to 
organize a game with their friends. Organizing or finding high quality 
pick-up basketball games in anywhere and at any time, well that just 
doesn't exist.
Enter the UBALLN® Basketball app.With UBALLN®, you’ll never have to guess when or where competitive pickup games are being played. All it takes is a simple tap of the screen to show you all you need to know.

Revolutionary App
 



Although there are several Pickup Basketball apps currently in the market that provide quality games, we know their game selection is still very limited. They may provide private and public games, but they lack premium locations and a large enough user population to make it worth wild for the individual users. This may be okay for their heavier user populated areas, but still is not optimal for reaching users nationally and abroad. When people want to hoop, location and player availability should never be a limitation. We already know how frustrating this can be, so we developed the UBALLN® Basketball app to solve this problem.

Who we are




HON is a
non-profit, non-governmental organisation (NGO):

In special
     consultative status with Economic and Social Council of
     the United Nations (ECOSOC).
In official
     relation with the World Health
     Organisation (WHO).

What we do 




Promote the dissemination of useful and reliable online
     health information worldwide; Every day, millions of certified pages are viewed by
Internet users.

Provide the most widely used certification initiative: The
     HONcode seal - translated into over 30 languages and present in 93 countries.

History 


The
HON Foundation was born in 1996 when the Internet was booming. Several
visionary medical experts from around the world realised that health-related
websites were proliferating with no control over the accuracy or reliability of
their content. They thus decided to create an organisation specially dedicated to educating people on, advocating for,
and maintaining transparent health information online.

How it works

HON
functions through a code of conduct which
consists of 8 principles
which health websites choose to conform to in order to obtain our certification (renewable annually)
and boast their own unique HONcode
seal and certificate to promote their  trustworthiness.







Today

HON
is the oldest and most respected quality code of conduct for online health
information with over 8,000 HONcode certified websites worldwide. Many of them
are highly respected, visited thousands of times daily and have been members of
the HON Foundation for years (www.webmd.com,
www.clevelandclinic.org, www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus etc.)

Our Challenges


With the number of health
     websites increasing daily, there is a huge demand for HONcode
     certification which requires websites to be
     reviewed by experts - this is time-consuming and costly.

The annual certification process used to be free, now it is a
     paying service with a yearly fee ranging from 55 USD to 360 USD.
Not all entities can afford to contribute e.g. websites of bodies
     located in developing countries, individual patients, small associations,
     etc.
Uncertified websites are not penalized. Our concern lies with
     the end-user/the reader who must be given access to transparent and reliable
     health information.



Our Solutions

1)  The ‘HONcode for All’ project: A fund pool to finance
these websites and render reliable health information accessible to all.
2)  Simplified access to certified websites. 

What we need



To raise US$100,000 to help support the annual recertification of websites in need.
To raise awareness of the importance of quality health information online and of
     the HONcode certification programme.
To allow HON to continue performing its excellent work.





The
impact of donors’ help

The Internet allows people to actively participate in their own
     healthcare, but being misguided by wrong health-related information can be
     devastating - our goal is to avoid this! 

By donating, you help raise the quality of health-related
     information on the Internet and thus empower citizens worldwide.

When you support HON, you commit to a service that is key to upholding
     reliable and trustworthy medical information. 

Other Ways You Can HelpThere are certainly a variety of ways to help the HON Foundation achieve its goals:
Help spread the word about our project through your website, emails, social media etc.
Promote the use of the HONcode seal by adding this banner to your website.
Encourage your website visitors/clients/partners to advocate for reliable and trustworthy health information on the Internet
Visit/Share/Like the HON Facebook and Twitter accounts

Financial transparency
We  guarantee the financial transparency of our
campaign which will be audited and available to
donors. Please note that Indiegogo charges 5% + commissions on foreign currency transactions if we
reach our objective of US$100,000, if not,
Indiegogo charges 8%. 

The HON Foundation appreciates donations of all amounts. Please not that
because we are a Swiss registered nonprofit organization, your donation is tax-deductible in Switzerland under certain conditions.
For ethical purposes, HON claims the right to maintain control
over the visibility it grants to donating parties as perks.

<div>
<p>I have tried many of the pre workouts from the top 10 pre workouts list and whilst some gave me the buzz and a slight boost I came to realise that all of them had the same things in common.</p>
<p>To save on costs, the 6 main ingredients in your usual pre-workouts (4 of them being some of the more costly ingredients) are in a much lower quantity than recommended for it to be a good workout. As well as this, when you scoop, it is impossible to guarantee the exact quantities of each ingredient. With our product, you get individually packed sachets so you are guaranteed to get the exact dose of each ingredient.</p>
<p>Because of this I set out to make my own preworkout for my own needs. It was not designed for sale at first, I just wanted the maximum benefit from my sessions.

</div></div>","Short Summary I'm sure, like myself, you are not the first person to have spent hours of their life trawling through the internet in vain hope of finding that one pre-workout with the correct recommended formula for an increased workout.

I have tried many of the pre workouts from the top 10 pre workouts list and whilst some gave me the buzz and a slight boost I came to realise that all of them had the same things in common.
To save on costs, the 6 main ingredients in your usual pre-workouts (4 of them being some of the more costly ingredients) are in a much lower quantity than recommended for it to be a good workout. As well as this, when you scoop, it is impossible to guarantee the exact quantities of each ingredient. With our product, you get individually packed sachets so you are guaranteed to get the exact dose of each ingredient.
Because of this I set out to make my own preworkout for my own needs. It was not designed for sale at first, I just wanted the maximum benefit from my sessions. It was only later on that I thought, why not pass on my creation to others like me that want to get the most from their time in the gym?
I'm sure the one question you’re asking is ""Why should I use Predominate?""
Predominate is a pre-workout that has the maximum recommended dosage for each of its 6 ingredients in the pre workout. (There are actually only 7 ingredients in total, the final being flavouring.)
Predominate comes in individual sachets with a specifically mixed daily allowance. Yes, that means no more scoop! Simply pour and go!
You can also have Predominate in 4 different flavours, so if you buy a months supply, you can have a mix of all 4! Who doesn't like variety?
Finally, in my rewards, I have mentioned that the Pre workout is customizable. At the moment the Caffeine and Theanine (linked) can be changed based on the customers request. The options are 200mg, 400mg or 600mg which can be requested at no additional cost.*
***PLEASE NOTE*** - Don't just ask for 600mg caffeine serving just because you can. As a guideline, a standard 500ml energy drink contains 160mg of caffeine.I myself only take a single serving whereas BigBen products owner takes a triple dose (he is however 140kg+ strongman competitor). Exceeding what is safe can be dangerous. If in doubt, start low and build up.

   What We Need & What You Get
We are looking for funding to the sum of £3,000. This will allow us to get the ingredients for our first batch. 
If our goal isn't achieved, we have a couple of potential investors that we will reach out to for the remaining. The reason we don't just go to them to begin with, is we want to give you guys the opportunity to try out the product first.
The Impact
 If you are seriously considering this pre-workout but don't see how your £2 will help look at it from this perspective; 1,500 people will fund what we need to get this ship moving. I understand that  there are just so many other pre-workouts out there. All I can say is, I suggest you take a quick look around and you will notice there are no others like Predominate.

<p>HoliDrink was first developed by Benny Lee in 2009 in Vancouver Canada. The reason Benny developed his own healthy drink, was because he was diagnosed with diabetes, and realized 99.99% of bottled juice and adulterated honey in the market have preservatives, sugar added, artificial sweetener and flavour, additives and lots of chemicals, which are not healthy and bad for diabetes.</p>
<p>So Benny made many experiments and perfected HoliDrink's secret formula. The main ingredients of HoliDrink are Honey and Lime, hence the ""Holi"" portmanteau name. By the way, HoliDrink only uses Raw/Real/Pure unpasteurized Canadian honey. Benny has been drinking HoliDrink daily ever since 2009. His neighbour, after tasting HoliDrink, told Benny that he wants to drink it every day.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits Benny has been gaining from drinking HoliDrink, are boosted immune system (he doesn't even get a flu/cold/cough), boosted memory and alertness, slim body, radiant skin, excellent digestion, no gastrointestinal disorder, sleep well, is no longer diabetic, free from colorectal cancer, no urinary tract infection, arthritis-free, etc. Basically a lot of conditions diagnosed by Benny's doctor are gone. </p>

The truth is real pure honey is beneficial to a type 2 diabetic person (it helps regulate your blood sugar), while adulterated honey is not pure honey (with additives, syrup or refined sugar or artificial sweeteners) so it is not beneficial to diabetic person.

Benny strongly believes that, drinking and eating healthily, coupled with regular physical exercises and positive mentality, will lead to optimal health, for your body, mind and spirit.</p>

The Impact If you have or know someone who has, similar health conditions like Benny used to have, then it is in your/their best interests to drink HoliDrink daily.
Your financial contribution to our crowdfunding campaign will make a difference in many people's healths, and it will allow us to share the benefits of drinking HoliDrink with more people and at a faster rate.
Let's create history together, let's make us healthier by drinking HoliDrink daily, and make HoliDrink the choice over caffeinated coffee/tea, alcoholic wine/beer and other juice with preservatives (or from concentrates) or carbonated soft-drink. Let's make HoliDrink the next Coca Cola but in the healthy drink category.

The Super Ingredients and their Health Benefits







   Risks & Challenges Like any business venture, there is a risk of failure, but let's be positive, HoliDrink is not only a thirst quencher or cold buster, but it is also very tasty and nutritious with tons of health benefits, it could be the next Coca Cola but in a healthy drink category.
It is a matter of getting the word out, letting people try and see for themselves the many health benefits from drinking HoliDrink daily for a period of time.
There are already lots of hoops to jump and many hurdles to overcome, for instances, getting HoliDrink made in a commercial kitchen that is approved by the Health Authority, in an area that is approved by the Municipal Zoning Authority, and bottle labels that comply with the complex rules and regulations of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
It is notorious, that starting a beverage manufacturing business is insanely hard, it is extremely difficult and costly to get it marketed and distributed, most startups got squashed by the big multinational beverage companies, but I am confident, with your support and my perseverance, and my vast business development working experience (including the successful launch of my 3 other businesses), plus my engineering/business/legal study, HoliDrink will succeed.   Other Ways You Can Help Some of you can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  So please help to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign, share it on your facebook/twitter/google+/instagram/pinterest.

<p>I designed the Hooded infinity Scarf and was awarded my Patent (D 693,096) in November 2011. I produced this design originally as a high end knitted silk wool product, went into production and it is selling online and in boutiques and Ski Shops now. But it is very expensive and i really wanted to get my design to a wider audience... and then...</p>
<p>In January of this year, after gaining a few pounds over the holidays it was back to the gym for me! What I noticed at the gym was people draping their towels on the equipment (YUK!), or wearing oversized or too small towels around their necks and over their heads. I realized what I needed was a towel version of my Hooded Infinity Scarf!</p>
<p>So I made one, and tried it, and I fell in love with it. </p>
<p>When I'm on the treadmill or bike I can use the hood to screen out distractions and keep me focused. It never falls off my shoulders during my workout, and I'm never draping a sweaty towel over the equipment. After my workout in the winter, when my hair is sweaty or freshly showered, the hood protects me from the cold and wind. And it's stylish and pretty.</p>
<p>I made some for my friends and they say it's genius.</p>
<p>I currently have my first test market order of towels and I am now offering a limited amount here on Indegogo! 150 white towels and 50 black towels are available NOW! Once those are gone, I would need to fund my next order. So if I can raise $12,000 I can do a manufacturing run large enough to produce them in multiple colors, that I can sell them for $20 each. I really think you'll love my Hooded Infinity Sport Towel if you try it.</p>
<p>(And if you're an organization, the towels are a great giveaway to clients, or employees, or at a business event. I can do customized towels with a saying or your logo.)</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

You benefit the most by walking in different environments as you improve. The glasses may be detached and the GaitAid can be used with head phones alone. The auditory feedback alone was shown to bring great improvement to walking. With some people, positive effects begin immediately during the first use. Practice is fun and is typically a 20 to 30-minute session. Each new session brings on a longer lasting improvement.<br/>

Stichting Parkinson's on the move



Globally over four million people suffer from Parkinson’s disease. For patients themselves as well as their families and care-givers dealing with Parkinson’s, it is often difficult to understand this illness. Our main objective is to help and support patients and people dealing with Parkinson's around the world.

- Easy to use

- A few minutes daily practice can lead to improved walking, balance and freedom from freezing
It's a training device - not something to walk around with daily. A residual effect, increases the more you practice. The residual effect is different from person to person.

All funds go directly to our GaitAid  project which is managed by our foundation: www.parkinsononthemovefoundation.org
If we don't reach our goal, the funds still go to our GaitAid project - Even one GaitAid for an establishment dealing with Parkinson's can still help at least 20 patients.

As you can see in the picture on the right, the images are clearly visible with high contrast. They are very easy to focus on, helping you to imagine stepping on them. While using the glasses, you see the tiled floor image and your surroundings at the same time. The usual therapy routine simply means going for a walk while stepping on the virtual tiles displayed on the glasses.



Practice on any safe walking path – in your home, in your own neighborhood, or a walking trail. You benefit the most by walking in different environments as you improve. The glasses may be detached and the GaitAid can be used with head phones alone. The auditory feedback alone was shown to bring great improvement to walking. With some people, positive effects begin immediately during the first use. Practice is fun and is typically a 20 to 30-minute session. Each new session brings on a longer lasting improvement.

<h2>Our Story</h2>

<h2>Why do we need your help?</h2>
<p>We ensure all our products are as natural as possible, vegan friendly, and free from anything nasty. When we produced our original range of effervescent tablets, they needed to contain certain non-natural ingredients to ensure they held together and dissolved properly when the time comes; similar to all effervescent tablets. </p>
<p>We can and will improve on this through research and development with our existing network of accredited nutritionists, chemists and university researchers. To achieve this, we need to raise £6,000 to meet the minimum costs of development and production run for the effervescent tablets. </p>
<p>The result? Nutrifiz Plus! The most natural formula possible without compromising on our core values of health, nutrition, convenience and great taste. We have a strong relationship with a large award-winning effervescent tablet producer and new recipes ready to go, which means we can have new products ready within 3 months of a successful campaign. Having already started work with flavour experts, we can assure you our new recipes will be even more delicious, natural and nutritious than our original ones.</p>
<p>We'll also be moving into the world of convenient powder sachets after an extremely successful trial with Hair of the Dog and Nutrifiz Sport! These can be much more flexible with bespoke formulas and taste, without compromising on nutrition - they'll  be all natural and contain as much nutrition as we can fit in! Production of these new powders will cost £4,000.</p>
<p>As you can see from our existing products, we’re pretty good at squeezing lots of vitamins, minerals and plant-nutrition! So you can enjoy the benefits of  wheatgrass and many other nutritious offerings from nature on-the-go. Just pop a sachet in your pocket or bag with no mess and no fuss! </p>
<p>We want everyone to be able to enjoy the benefits of wheatgrass and other wonderfully nutritious offerings from nature in the most delicious, convenient and nutritious formats. We will be giving sneak peaks of our progress as the campaign progresses and thank you for your support!</p>

<p>My name is Dr. Martin Falappino. I am a family practice physician of 32 years.  About 20 years ago I significantly changed my focus from disease orientation (classical medicine), to optimal health education and the natural treatment of medical problems.  Over the last 20 years I have developed numerous natural treatment protocols that allow patients to get off medications by using natural supplements, precursors, hormones, and lifestyle modification techniques to ""fix"" their medical conditions.  From this perspective, KSK Cold Spray (KSK) was born and developed.  </p>
<p>What's in KSK?  KSK is a blend of minerals,  nano-particle minerals, and herbal elixirs.  All of the ingredients are germicidal in nature.  How it works and its uniqueness is complex and lengthy.  Go to <a href=""http://www.kskcold.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kskcold.com</a>  for all the details you could ever want. </p>
<p>This campaign is both a working production-shipping campaign.  I have a working product based on 2 years of trial and improvement with about 400 of my patients.  200 of these patients participated in a clinical trial.  The results showed a 75% success rate based on elimination or near elimination of cold and flu symptoms within 1-2 days.  Total side effect rate is about 19%.  The side effect is nasal burning from spraying.  It always goes away within seconds.  Less than 10% of patients stopped using KSK due to the burning.  The other 10% with slight burning were able to continue because the burning stops after the first few sprays.</p>
<p>The campaign is both for continued R &amp; D of KSKspray  (specifically to continue the development of a children's spray) but also for production funds and advertising.  Indiegogo's approach is important to me  for 2 reasons.  First, I don't want massive loan debt to start this company. </p>
<p>Secondly, to connect with people that see the bigger societal picture.  That being, the massive abuse by physicians in over prescribing antibiotics for cold &amp; flu illnesses.  Antibiotics don't work against viruses which cause colds and flu's.  We doctors give patients antibiotics knowing they are useless, just to get rid of the patients.  I resisted doing this for 30 years, but finally, patients just wore me out.   I began to do what I despised, giving worthless antibiotics to get rid of patients who were begging for ""a magic cure"" for  their flu virus symptoms.  This drove me to research this problem so I could give something real to my patients.  Hence, the discovery and development of KSK Cold Spray.     </p>
<p>The magnitude of KSK Cold Spray is this:  It's  more than just a germicidal product for sale.   It is truly part of the answer to a problem that must be addressed.  We doctors cannot continue to indiscriminately give out antibiotics to appease patients (for its placebo effect).   The unfortunate truth is, it has become a business tactic that helps pay the overhead.  And, it is getting worse,  not better.  The consequence to this action is, we doctors are contributing to the rampant mutation of common bacteria into resistant strains.  These bacterial strains can be devastating(even lethal) to significantly ill patients.  People think that the MRSA bacteria is bad(the resistant staph you hear about).  MRSA is child's play compared to some of the new resistant bacteria that most of you have not heard of.   KSK is one small part of how this problem will be effectively handled.  Why?  Because patients will not go to their doctor for useless antibiotics for a cold or flu.   They will use KSK and their own immune system will get them better in 1-2 days.    </p>
<p>More Specific Details on KSK:</p>
<p>Funding:  I hope to reach the goal of 500K for  R &amp; D, production costs, and advertising.   R &amp; D will need about 125K.  I need to formalize my first study and start a second formal study with a medical school.  Most likely it will be with my alma mater.  I am a former associate professor with the Department of Family Practice at the Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona, California.  I have discussed the study concept in detail with the Dean of the Medical School and she would be excited to do a study like this. </p>
<p>Production costs would consume another 200K.  Equipment, 2 employee salaries, and raw materials would utilize these funds.  Currently, I have about 1000 bottles of KSK in stock.  Current production capabilities are 2000 bottles per week.   Furthermore, the person+machine production style initially affords me the ability to rapidly increase production at a .5 logarithmic rate each 6 week cycle as necessary.</p>
<p>Shipping is a different animal.  During the campaign, it will take 10-14 days for contributors to receive the product.  After the campaign, that will improve.  If shipping is delayed, you will receive extra bottle(s) as compensation.  Also, something worth mentioning:  It's not hard to find complaints against Indiegogo on the net.  The main one being, contributors never getting the product.  I am a physician with a reputation to uphold.  I am not invisible.  Plug my name in the internet and you can instantly find my office.  You will get the product.  Its just I am 62 years old trying to re-invent my life.  So I ask for a little patience.  Thanks.</p>
<p>So, continuing the funding discussion,  advertising would also be significant fund consumer.  I have looked extensively at, and obtained professional consulting regarding the  most cost effective advertising models.  I have settled on an internet model that uniquely manipulates the affiliate marketing constructs for optimal efficiency.  I am open to discuss the precise nature of this approach with appropriate contributors. </p>
<p>At the end of the campaign, if I don't reach the goal, I will apportion the funds to ""start"" production, sales, and advertising .</p>
<p>Other details worth mentioning: </p>
<p>What are the perks? The pain perk is getting  the product well below retail.  This allows you to share the product with friends and family.  You will be amazed at how effective KSK really is. </p>
<p>Risks:  KSK is all natural.  It's totally safe and next year we will have a children's formula delivered by nebulizer that all the mom's in American will love.  Because their children will also get better in 1-2 days.  The problem that remains is in the 9-10% of people that just can't take KSK in the nose due to the burning.  Still working on that, and will in the end develop (R &amp; D needed) a KSK ""mild spray"" for these people. But for sore throats, you will be blown away.  When KSK is started at the first sign of sore throat, it has a 90% success rate to destroy the symptoms!!  And only 3% of people said it burns!</p>
<p>And finally, who am I?  To understand me, and the mission I am on at this point in my life, go to <a href=""http://www.drdebunk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.drdebunk.com</a> for details on who I am becoming.  Dr. Debunk, my YouTube name, is the ""medical truth teller"".  The purpose of Dr. Debunk is twofold.  First.  To be an free educational resource for all Americans to understand the medical concepts that produce the ""optimal health lifestyle"".  The purpose being,  to age as slowly as possible, and retard/eliminate the process of disease.  I have watched patients die for 32 years.  It is very different process to die of old age vs. dying of a disease process.  All of us in the optimum health field aspire to objectify the process of having optimum energy, motivation, endurance, and strength to the end of our ""old age, non diseased"" lives. </p>
<p>And secondly, Dr. Debunk is here to  to debunk the myths, garbage, and crap spread by doctors and other health professions so Americans can enjoy optimal health at all decades of life.  Unfortunately, since aspects of medicine are counter-productive to your optimum health.  Dr. Debunk feels compelled to illuminate these areas in medicine.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day, what am I passionate about is simple this:  Defining what quality of health means and furthermore, what are the lifestyle factors that produce optimal energy, motivation, endurance and strength at all decades of life.  After studying this for the last 22 years of my 32 years as a physician, I have something to contribute.  People today over 50 years old that are ""in the know"", will age 20-25 years slower than the rest of the population, and die of old age at 105 (+10 or -5 years), and not of disease from 72-80 (with the last 5-10 years sucking badly).  I am Dr. Debunk, the Medical Truth Teller.</p>

<p><span>Dava Muramatsu introduces her hand-crafted one of a kind jewelry collection, Nymph Jewels.  </span></p>

<b>My Pilates studio is very different than other studios nationwide due to the background and certifications I hold in Egoscue (postural therapy) and Pilates.  Everyone starts with a posture assessment, gait analysis and functional testing.  We sit down and discuss their health history and goals before I put together a customized program for them to do at home and in the studio.  Every 4 weeks I retake their photos and make adjustments to their programs.  This is the motivation that some people need to keep going.  By seeing their photos every 4 weeks, this also helps to keep them on track to achieve their goals.</b>

increase in my core strength and stability.

keeping workouts fun and interesting.  I

I’ve had severe back pain and problems with both knees. After two knee
surgeries and several forms of therapy to help reduce the pain caused by
bulging discs in my back, I was still in constant pain. I didn’t want to
 live
my life with pain, nor did I want to continue taking pain medications. 
With the
advice from my chiropractor, I decided to take a different approach.  I 
started practicing Pilates with Vanessa Kelly about a year ago. Her name
 was
given to me by a trusted trainer - I only wanted the best if I was going
 to
venture down a different path.  I started feeling results within the 
first
month. By no means was I pain free, but the progression during this past
 year
has been incredible. With the personally tailored exercises Vanessa 
gives me
each workout in combination with her expertise knowledge of how to 
strengthen
my body without causing stress to my knees or back, I don’t live with 
pain
every day. Granted, there are days when my knees or back might bother me
 still,
but it’s nothing compared to before I started practicing Pilates with 
Vanessa
on a regular basis. To this day, I am progressively getting better and 
better.
She has shown me how to take that alternate approach to my health and 
the
results have followed.”<br/>

My Pilates studio is very different than other studios nationwide due to the background and certifications I hold in Egoscue (postural therapy) and Pilates.  Everyone starts with a posture assessment, gait analysis and functional testing.  We sit down and discuss their health history and goals before I put together a customized program for them to do at home and in the studio.  Every 4 weeks I retake their photos and make adjustments to their programs.  This is the motivation that some people need to keep going.  By seeing their photos every 4 weeks, this also helps to keep them on track to achieve their goals.

“For years I have
struggled with lower back pain, the results of old sports injuries combined
with a desk job that also requires a large amount of travel.  Over the past year of regular Pilates
sessions I have seen a dramatic decrease in my back pain, as well as a noticeable
increase in my core strength and stability. 
My instructor, Vanessa Kelly, is incredibly knowledgeable and always has
new workouts planned to continue to build strength and flexibility, while also
keeping workouts fun and interesting.  I
would recommend Pilates classes and training with Vanessa without reservation
to anyone.”  -Scott Schmidt


I cannot express how much I appreciate the time you have taken to read about what I do and how I want to continue to change peoples lives.  The best thing you can do for my potential clients is continue to spread the word amongst your friends, family and colleagues who you may think can help with the studio expansion.  And if you're in the area please come by to check out the studio for yourself!“For several years,
I’ve had severe back pain and problems with both knees. After two knee
surgeries and several forms of therapy to help reduce the pain caused by
bulging discs in my back, I was still in constant pain. I didn’t want to
 live
my life with pain, nor did I want to continue taking pain medications. 
With the
advice from my chiropractor, I decided to take a different approach.  I 
started practicing Pilates with Vanessa Kelly about a year ago. Her name
 was
given to me by a trusted trainer - I only wanted the best if I was going
 to
venture down a different path.  I started feeling results within the 
first
month. By no means was I pain free, but the progression during this past
 year
has been incredible. With the personally tailored exercises Vanessa 
gives me
each workout in combination with her expertise knowledge of how to 
strengthen
my body without causing stress to my knees or back, I don’t live with 
pain
every day. Granted, there are days when my knees or back might bother me
 still,
but it’s nothing compared to before I started practicing Pilates with 
Vanessa
on a regular basis. To this day, I am progressively getting better and 
better.
She has shown me how to take that alternate approach to my health and 
the
results have followed.”

</div>","What Is PTSD?Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event. Getting effective treatment after PTSD symptoms develop can be critical to reduce symptoms and improve function.PTSD Statistics

One in Five Veterans are diagnosed with PTSD.  That is 300,000 veterans.
One veteran a day will take his life because of PTSD.
Veterans account for 20% of all suicides.
 $85.9 Million has been spent on treating PTSD...with very little success.
5.2 Million people have some sort of PTSD in any given year.
 About 6 of every 10 (or 60%) of men and 5 of every 10 (or 50%) of women experience at least one trauma in their lives. Women are more likely to experience sexual assault and child sexual abuse. Men are more likely to experience accidents, physical assault, combat, disaster, or to witness death or injury.
About 7 or 8 out of every 100 people (or 7-8% of the population) will have PTSD at some point in their lives.

<p><b>Our Story:</b></p>
<p>My wife and I spent the last 4 years working on cruise ships as Future Cruise
Consultants. Over our combined 12 years working
in the cruise industry, we noticed that there was a huge disparity between
websites, community message boards and other “expert” cruise information
resources. Currently you have to spend hours searching between 5-8 websites to get information on
travel.  This includes flights, hotels and booking your cruise. There are great sources of information, but you have to go through so many different reviews, travel blogs, forum posts and top 10 articles to get the information that matters to the reader.  The overwhelming
amount of information leads people to give up and just go with the flow.  This often results in lost opportunities,
financial losses and added stress during a much needed vacation.    We vowed we would do what we could to help as many people get targeted expert information quickly and painlessly.  </p>

on a lot of important events as a result.  After losing my mother to breast cancer, I

information in the palm of your hand.
2.Get 1000 users who will be our founding beta testing team.
Our Story:
My wife and I spent the last 4 years working on cruise ships as Future Cruise
Consultants. Over our combined 12 years working
in the cruise industry, we noticed that there was a huge disparity between
websites, community message boards and other “expert” cruise information
resources. Currently you have to spend hours searching between 5-8 websites to get information on
travel.  This includes flights, hotels and booking your cruise. There are great sources of information, but you have to go through so many different reviews, travel blogs, forum posts and top 10 articles to get the information that matters to the reader.  The overwhelming
amount of information leads people to give up and just go with the flow.  This often results in lost opportunities,
financial losses and added stress during a much needed vacation.    We vowed we would do what we could to help as many people get targeted expert information quickly and painlessly.  

Introducing Cruise
Collective:
We're not travel agents trying to sell you a cruise. Our core focus is connecting people to answers.   It’s about making
sure our users have access to the personalized information they need to make
the right decisions when planning their cruise so it’s a success. 
We want to create the world’s best cruise knowledge base that
provides expert cruise information in concise, bite-sized chunks that is
tailored to the user through a smartphone app. 
The core features will be the fast personalized search
results accessible anytime on a mobile phone and the ability to push questions to
a community of experienced cruise experts who have been on cruises and best
matches their profile.  Our community of
experts will understand how answering a simple question in real time will make
a huge impact in someone’s busy life. Users will have the ability to add pushed
answers into the knowledge base so that quality information may be accessible
to others.





Ask or Push from the start            Answers with Related Questions


New community members set up a profile and tell us their
cruise experience and goals. This step is critical, as it will create the
foundation for our profile filter that is based on our years of consulting with

provide personalized answers that make an impact.  Our knowledge base will be created from the
start using the most advanced search technology and designed to learn
as it grows, nearly able to guess which question you’ll ask before you finish typing it out.  
New community members who have never taken a cruise will get a list of suggested answers to read that best matches their travel style and goals.  It will be similar to a 'getting started' guide, but as if it were written specifically for them.   This will get them up to speed quickly on the items that matter most to them.

Tiffany was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (1), requiring daily dose of insulin since 1990, and with Hashimoto's disease (2). She also had thyroid cancer (3), yet was able to fight that with chemo. And if that was not enough, she also had a miscarriage when she was seven months pregnant. The only thing that kept her going is HOPE. Hope to find a cure for type 1 diabetes that literally affects millions. 

A few days ago, her diabetes was determined to take her life again, finding out that she was dying of organ failure. A poison had entered into her blood stream, called sepsis, along with a buildup of a dangerous amount of potassium. This has caused her kidney failure. When your kidneys fail, they can’t perform their job of removing extra potassium from the body. So she is in need of a kidney donor.

Currently she is being hospitalized. Doctors are doing a lot of testing, blood work, biopsies and closely determining what caused the kidney failure. She is at a stage 5 (4) and getting iron injections and had her first-ever dialysis treatment. It causes her to feel horribly sick and weak.

Her kidneys for now are stable at 28%, yet it’s still the same struggle everyday to just feel “normal”. It is her hope that she is blessed with a new kidney sooner than later and the gift at living a life that doesn’t consist of being sick all the time. 

Your donation will allow her to do dialysis from home. She just became a nurse after years of studying and is looking forward to living her dream of helping others. Her insurance however does not cover everything. The cost of a year’s worth of treatments is about $38,000, with an upfront co-pay of $4,437. After just starting her job at the hospital and an unpaid internship two weeks, she does not have the money to cover the co-pay…causing stress her body cannot afford.

Let's beginning, shall we? </p><p> </p><p>First and foremost, my name is Robert E. Lubin, I'm 25 years<br/>old and I live in Seattle, Washington. I am the CEO/Creator of the brand(s)<br/>Fresh Kics LLC, Forever Fresh &amp; Fly, &amp; Beautiful Fresh &amp; Fly. Fresh<br/>Kics Founded December 2010 in Spokane, Washington, can be defined by the shoe<br/>aspect of the brand, and the clothing line brand Forever Fresh and Fly (3FFF),<br/>Founded November 2013 in Seattle, can be defined by the apparel and accessories<br/>aspect of the brand Fresh Kics is a “fresh” product. How many time have you<br/>logged on a computer and typed in ""Fresh Kicks"" into the search<br/>engine just to find a whole bunch of so called ""Fresh Kicks"" products<br/>such as Jordan's, Nikes, Reebok, etc... But never an actual name brand that's<br/>actually called for what it is? It's the same way when walking anywhere and<br/>someone stop to ask you, ""Where you get them Fresh Kicks from?"" So,<br/>why not start a brand with the actual name with a well-known shoe designer?! By<br/>using the word “fresh”, it can mean many things: the way they fit, the way they<br/>look, the way they make a customer feel while wearing them, and the ability to<br/>be unique, fresh and fly. The creator and team wants people to instantly question<br/>when they stumble upon this brand is: what is Fresh Kics, who created this<br/>ingenious idea, where they can buy them, how much the product is, and how quick<br/>they can get to feeling fresh in their own pair of Fresh Kics shoes or Fresh<br/>Kics product.</p><p>We’ve had a rare opportunity to have a renown shoe designer<br/>come on board with us by the name, Mark Schwartz, who is known as a<br/>Professional Shoe designer &amp; Painter. He is and has been the<br/>designer/creator behind our brand Fresh Kics since 2011. Mark has truly blessed<br/>us with his gift through the aspect of designs &amp; prototypes he has done for<br/>this company. We believe with Mark on our team Fresh Kics will soon make<br/>history and one day we will be the next biggest household name brand such as<br/>Nike, Adidas, Reebok, etc. We’re currently working on getting some new<br/>prototypes done with his connects in Europe that will be bringing something<br/>new, but also Fresh &amp; Fly to the market. “Sure, Mark Schwartz is Oprah's favorite shoe designer. Of course he worked with Vivier and hung with Warhol. And yeah, he's designed footwear for Ralph and Calvin. But take away his twenty year design career and his impressive list of one-name friends and what have you got? Well, you have one world-class artist, for starters.” (<a href=""http://shoes.about.com/od/footwear/a/mark_schwartz.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://shoes.about.com/od/footwear/a/mark_schwartz.htm</a>) </p><p>“For over 30 years, Mark has been churning out unique and<br/>interesting designs of shoes; an accessory that he considers to be the most<br/>artistic and important. His shoe designs have graced the runways of Paris,<br/>Milan and New York as well as the pages of many fashion publications such as<br/>Vogue, Elle, W and many more. </p><p> </p><p><b>Mission statement:  </b>By using the terminology “fresh,” it can<br/>be defined by how the products fit, the way they look, the way they make the<br/>customer feel while wearing them. Overall, it’s the ability to be unique, fresh<br/>and fly. Hence our mission statement; To empower, build and unite communities, and give hope through fashion statements, that anything is possible. We want to target the youth and be that seed of inspiration, faith, hope, encouragement, through our Shoes and Apparel. Our long term goal is to be the next biggest fashion<br/>household name on the market, and to be recognized through our shoe and apparel<br/>line, as well as our unique logo. </p><p><br/><b>SWOT Analysis</b>:</p><p><b>Our Strength</b><br/>despite being a startup company, we have quickly gained ground via our 3 online<br/>stores, with some of our apparel being sold out. We have statistics on social<br/>media and have reached over 17 countries so far. <br/><b>Our Weakness</b><br/>is the cost of capital. A good brand without marketing is nothing. We need<br/>funds to be pumped in to Marketing, Production and general overheads to support<br/>our current sales and future promotions.</p><p><b>The Opportunity</b><br/>we have is our target market has a wide age range (Babies-to-adults) who love<br/>the latest fashion trends. Ladies can’t have enough pairs of shoes, and guys<br/>alike will always want that fresh tee or hat. We intend to expand our line in<br/>to perfumes and colognes, lady purses and accessories once our brand breaks<br/>ground.</p><p><b>Our main Threat</b><br/>is big name competitors in the fashion industry, which through the help of<br/>celebrity endorsers. We do have a few celebs in our gear on our social networks<br/>such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, we are beginning to close the gap and<br/>gain great recognition. </p><p><b>Stage of development: </b>We are marketing our brand by word of<br/>the mouth, and via social networks. We already have production going on, we have a shoe designer Mark Schwartz and 3 on line stores and already tapping the market. </p><p><b>Products and services: </b>Our main product is the shoe line (Sneakers), of which we have proto types, but due to the cost of production it’s on hold. Nevertheless, we have a wide assortment of apparel ranging from bennies, tees, hats, hoodies just to mention a few, some of which are sold out on line, and others have been given out to celebrities who have showcased them on Facebook and other social media. </p><p><b>Target Market: </b>Our Market is an open playing field<br/>that spots all races, creed, color, age groups, sex, nationalities, and or<br/>religion. We intend to have the latest and greatest fashion trends to appeal to<br/>this group through our different products and fashion in our shoes and apparel. So far, we have had everyone from ages 5-60years old rocking our brand and purchasing more than twice from us as products get better and better. We had nothing but great feedbacks every time we sold a product to any of our consumers.</p><p> </p><p><b>Marketing and Sales Strategy: </b>Our main focus, at the moment, is to grow<br/>as a team, focusing on both our short and long term goals. <i>Fresh Kics LLC</i><br/>is providing a global platform of branding to the fashion industry.

We plan to secure a number of ""O.E.M” deals that will<br/>upgrade our current clothing and shoe products as well as creating new products to enter into other industries. We also intend to diversify our products; </p><p><br/>For example: Fresh Kics is currently teaming up with Graham at Maxonix (div Arovox LLC) to get placement on their new development series of drumstick bags and drum cases which will include our logo, as well as teaming up with the number 1 drumstick company in the world ""Promark"" to revolutionize the stick bag<br/>industry by creating a luxury brand of drumstick bags.<span> </span><br/></p><p><b>Endorsers</b><b>:</b> Here at <i>Fresh Kics</i> we understand the value of having endorsers to promote our products in a global manner. <span>Our Marketing President, Jovan Dawkins, is a very successful musician, music producer, A&amp;R.

Au premier regard il a tout d´un garçon comme les autres. Il a 9 ans, est intelligent et timide. 
Mais il est autiste.
Il est également atteint d´un forme de mutisme, ce qui veut dire que dans certaines situations il ne me parle pas et pas toujours à tout le monde. Il a aussi un trouble de l´attention avec de l´hyperactivité. <br/></p><p>
De ce fait il n´a que peu de contact avec les gens qui l´entourent. Son loisir favori est l´ordinateur, notamment des jeux tels que Minecraft. 
Afin qu´il puisse se retirer lorsqu´il accumule un trop plein d´émotions, nous souhaiterions lui construire une pièce supplémentaire dans sa chambre.
Pour ce faire, des murs supplémentaires sont nécessaires. Nous aimerions accrocher un sac de box et aménager un coin avec des coussins dans lesquels il pourra se blottir et reprendre son calme. Il pourrait également se dépenser sans nécessairement faire du sport en groupe. 
Actuellement nous vivons au premier étage d´une maison familiale. Nous sommes cependant en train de laisser construire notre maison, ou il ne pourra plus déranger les voisins car il crie et piétine lorsqu´il est dépassé par ses émotions ou simplement lorsque sa journée a mal commencé. <br/></p><p>Malheureusement, nos voitures respectives sont tombées en panne l´une après l´autre en très peu de temps. Nous en avons besoin pour aller travailler, mais aussi pour amener Florian et sa sœur de 11 ans aux séances de thérapie. Nous avons donc été obligés d´utiliser l´argent économisé pour le rêve de Florian afin de pouvoir faire réparer les voitures.

Zudem hat er eine Form des Mutismus (d.h. er spricht in bestimmten Situationen nichtmal mit mir und  nicht immer mit jedem Menschen) und er hat zusätzlich adhs.Dadurch hat er nur sehr wenige Sozialkontakte, sein liebstes Hobby ist der PC , Vorallem Landwirtschaftssimulatoren  und Minecraft haben es ihm angetan.Damit er sich, wenn es ihm zu viel wird, zurückziehen kann oder er auch seine angestauten Emotionen los werden kann, würden wir ihm gerne in seinem Zimmer einen extra Raum einrichten, Dazu wären zuätzliche Wände nötig, es soll ein Boxsack aufgehängt werden,  sowie eine kleine Zone mit Kissen, in die er sich einkuscheln und zur Ruhe kommen kann.Auf dem Trampolin im Garten könnte er sich zusätzlich auspowern ohne in einer Gruppe Sport machen zu müssen,Zur Zeit wohnen wir noch im 1.OG eines Mehrfamilienhauses. Wir sind gerade dabei ein Haus zu bauen, in dem er die Nachbarn nicht 
mehr stören kann, wenn er mal wieder überfordert ist und brüllt oder trampelt.
 Oder einfach morgens schon früh wach ist und einen schlechten Start in den Tag hat.Leider sind jetzt innerhalb kurzer Zeit unsere Autos defekt gewesen, ohne die wir nicht zur Arbeit kommen und schon gar nicht zu den Therapien mit meinem Sohn bzw mit seiner 11 jährigen Schwester. Somit mußten wir leider das für seinen Raum gesparte Geld für die Reperaturen ausgeben. Bitte helft uns seinen Traum zu verwirklichen! Jeder Cent hilftI collect for my son Florian to realize his dream of a relaxing and time out room and ev. for the garden, a large trampoline.At first glance it looks like a normal healthy boy, he is intelligent, cautious and 9 years old.But  he is autistic.He also has a form of mutism (ie he speaks in certain situations, not 
even with me, and not always with each man) and he has adhd addition. As a result, he has very few social contacts, his favorite hobby is 
the PC especially Agriculture simulators and Minecraft have it done to 
him.So that it does when it is too much to him, may withdraw or he can get
 rid of his pent-up emotions, we would like to set him in his room an 
extra room,These walls Complementary services would be required, it shall be a 
punching bag to be hung, and a small area with cushions, in which he 
snuggle and be at peace.On the trampoline in the garden he could enjoy a workout in addition without having to make a group sport,Currently we  live on the 1st floor of an apartment building. We
 are in the process of building a house in which he can no longer 
disturb the neighbors when he is overwhelmed again and yells or 
trampling.  within a short time our cars have been broken, without 
which we would not come to work and not to the therapies with 
my son and his 11 year old sister. Thus, we unfortunately had to spend the  money for the repairs. Please help us to realize his dream!  Je collecte des fonds afin de pouvoir réaliser le rêve de mon  fils Florian d´une salle de jeu ou il pourra aussi se détendre, ainsi qu´éventuellement un grand trampoline pour notre jardin. 
Au premier regard il a tout d´un garçon comme les autres. Il a 9 ans, est intelligent et timide. 
Mais il est autiste.
Il est également atteint d´un forme de mutisme, ce qui veut dire que dans certaines situations il ne me parle pas et pas toujours à tout le monde. Il a aussi un trouble de l´attention avec de l´hyperactivité. 
De ce fait il n´a que peu de contact avec les gens qui l´entourent. Son loisir favori est l´ordinateur, notamment des jeux tels que Minecraft. 
Afin qu´il puisse se retirer lorsqu´il accumule un trop plein d´émotions, nous souhaiterions lui construire une pièce supplémentaire dans sa chambre.
Pour ce faire, des murs supplémentaires sont nécessaires. Nous aimerions accrocher un sac de box et aménager un coin avec des coussins dans lesquels il pourra se blottir et reprendre son calme. Il pourrait également se dépenser sans nécessairement faire du sport en groupe. 
Actuellement nous vivons au premier étage d´une maison familiale. Nous sommes cependant en train de laisser construire notre maison, ou il ne pourra plus déranger les voisins car il crie et piétine lorsqu´il est dépassé par ses émotions ou simplement lorsque sa journée a mal commencé. Malheureusement, nos voitures respectives sont tombées en panne l´une après l´autre en très peu de temps. Nous en avons besoin pour aller travailler, mais aussi pour amener Florian et sa sœur de 11 ans aux séances de thérapie. Nous avons donc été obligés d´utiliser l´argent économisé pour le rêve de Florian afin de pouvoir faire réparer les voitures. 
S´il vous plait, aidez-nous à réaliser son rêve. Chaque centime compte!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h4>About Us</h4>
<p><b style=""font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px;""><i><br/></i></b></p>
<p>Hi, we are the Swansons and we reside in the beautiful state of Vermont.  We've always been pretty health and environmentally conscious people.  We always eat our veggies, exercise, recycle and try to keep waste to a minimum.  However, around the same time our son was born, we realized how necessary it is to really know where our food comes from and how it is raised/farmed.  We became frustrated with how difficult it was to actually have access to healthy, organic, unprocessed foods.   During our research, we also discovered that the way many foods are grown/raised, especially meat, causes a lot of harm to our planet.  So, with our health, our beautiful planet and our children's futures in mind, we challenged ourselves to live an even healthier lifestyle and demonstrate even better earth-friendly habits by thinking outside the box.  We opened our eyes to a solution that has been in front of us all along - insects.  Specifically, crickets.  </p>

<p>The livestock sector occupies 70% of all agricultural land and 30% of the land surface of the planet.  It is one of the major contributors to global warming, contributing over 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions, a higher share than the transport sector (<a href=""http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6294"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">One study puts this number at 51%</a>).  It is the largest source of water pollution and a major player in antibiotic and pesticide use.</p>
<p>To quote from '<a href=""http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Livestocks Long Shadow</a> (a report released by the FAO in 2006)'</p>
<blockquote><i>‘The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.  The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.’</i></blockquote>
<p>Realizing the way in which we raise the animals that we eat is destroying the planet, was a wake-up call for us.  We started looking for alternative sources of protein.  The answer came in the form of <a href=""http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3253e/i3253e00.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a paper</a> written by the FAO.</p>
<p>Before we talk about crickets, we would like to admit that we aren't vegetarians (we've tried, but failed), and we don't want to get rid of the livestock industry all together.  We are fortunate enough to live in Vermont, and have access to meat that has been raised in the best way possible.  This is what we want for the rest of the country (and the world).  However, even if we focus on quality over quantity when it comes to meat, we need to realize that we also have the problem of food shortage to face.  So, it's because of the population growth, our health and our environment that we need to find an additional source of protein. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: left;""><b><i>Why Crickets?</i></b></h2>

<p>In addition to just being really good for you, crickets are much more efficient at converting food they eat in to usable protein, they require almost no water and they emit far less greenhouse gases (as demonstrated in the diagrams below).</p>

</div></div>","About Us

Hi, we are the Swansons and we reside in the beautiful state of Vermont.  We've always been pretty health and environmentally conscious people.  We always eat our veggies, exercise, recycle and try to keep waste to a minimum.  However, around the same time our son was born, we realized how necessary it is to really know where our food comes from and how it is raised/farmed.  We became frustrated with how difficult it was to actually have access to healthy, organic, unprocessed foods.   During our research, we also discovered that the way many foods are grown/raised, especially meat, causes a lot of harm to our planet.  So, with our health, our beautiful planet and our children's futures in mind, we challenged ourselves to live an even healthier lifestyle and demonstrate even better earth-friendly habits by thinking outside the box.  We opened our eyes to a solution that has been in front of us all along - insects.  Specifically, crickets.  


The Problem




( Above is an image of a massive feedlot.  The pond in the middle is animal waste.)
The livestock sector occupies 70% of all agricultural land and 30% of the land surface of the planet.  It is one of the major contributors to global warming, contributing over 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions, a higher share than the transport sector (One study puts this number at 51%).  It is the largest source of water pollution and a major player in antibiotic and pesticide use.
To quote from 'Livestocks Long Shadow (a report released by the FAO in 2006)'
‘The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.  The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.’
Realizing the way in which we raise the animals that we eat is destroying the planet, was a wake-up call for us.  We started looking for alternative sources of protein.  The answer came in the form of a paper written by the FAO.
Before we talk about crickets, we would like to admit that we aren't vegetarians (we've tried, but failed), and we don't want to get rid of the livestock industry all together.  We are fortunate enough to live in Vermont, and have access to meat that has been raised in the best way possible.  This is what we want for the rest of the country (and the world).  However, even if we focus on quality over quantity when it comes to meat, we need to realize that we also have the problem of food shortage to face.  So, it's because of the population growth, our health and our environment that we need to find an additional source of protein. 

Why Crickets?

Once you get over the ‘Eww gross’ factor, it becomes crystal clear that insects are going to be an integral part of our diet in the future.  The insect that is going to start this food revolution is the Cricket.  
Here’s Why:
Crickets are high in protein, actually having twice the amount of beef.  They are high in iron, calcium, magnesium, zinc and Vitamin B-12.  In fact, crickets are a complete protein, containing all nine essential amino acids.  And they taste pretty darn good too.
In addition to just being really good for you, crickets are much more efficient at converting food they eat in to usable protein, they require almost no water and they emit far less greenhouse gases (as demonstrated in the diagrams below).








If you still can’t get past the ‘Eww’ factor, consider this…you are already eating bugs…lots of them.  The average american eats an estimated 1-2 pounds of bugs each year, they just don’t know it.  The FDA allows insect fragments in practically all food.  So if you eat chocolate or peanut butter or drink coffee or beer, you are already passively eating insects.  We think it’s time for us to get active about eating insects, and in doing so, save ourselves and the planet.
 This is why we are going to, with your help, start a full-scale cricket farm.

Why this will work.

Crickets have been anointed the ‘Gateway Bug.' There are currently over 30 companies selling cricket based foods, and that number is growing rapidly.  Demand for crickets is outpacing supply.  We plan to help supply that demand by growing the best product possible in Vermont’s first cricket farm.



Why Vermont?

The State of Vermont, more than any other state, is positioned to be a perfect launching pad for this food revolution.  Crazy ideas like, knowing where our food comes from and embracing the fight against climate change are welcome here.  Vermont has also established itself as a powerhouse in the food and beverage arena.  What better way to wash down that delicious fried cricket than with a Heady Topper (or something from Hill Farmstead…or Lawsons…or any of the other amazing beers from Vermont)?  How about cricket-flour bread with some Bayley Hazen Blue?  And you know Ben and Jerry are going to come up with some crazy cricket ice cream.  In keeping with this tradition of excellence, we want to produce nothing but the best crickets possible.

Where is the money going?

Our goal is to raise enough money so that we can cover the initial cost of all of the equipment and warehouse space, as well as being able to operate for six months.
  The costs break down as follows:


Lease (6 months) : $26,700
Utilities : $3,000
Incubation Tent (for eggs and baby crickets) : $3,000
Grow out tent : $6,000

Cricket 'Condos' : $1,000
Nutrition Testing : $1,000
Misc (including food and water containers, egg laying trays, cricket-proofing, initial food purchase etc) : $5,000

We are also looking in to the possibility of building a space.  This option would be more expensive up front, but would be much more cost effective overall.

If we are fortunate enough to raise over our goal of $70,000, we will use that additional money to further research and develop the most efficient way of farming crickets.

<p><b>About Vitiligo</b></p>
<p><b>Vitiligo</b> (pronounced vit-ill-EYE-go) is a generally unpredictable skin condition, which results in white patches appearing on the skin. While
the exact cause of vitiligo is unknown, it has been confirmed that an
autoimmune component plays a strong role in the condition. The chronic nature of
the condition, long term treatment, lack of uniform effective therapy and
unpredictable cause of the condition has a significant impact upon the quality
of life of individuals living with vitiligo. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It has a devastating effect on social life of the patient and their family.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Vitiligo</b> is a life-long condition and it’s unlikely that you will ever be completely free of it. Vitiligo isn't contagious, so you can't catch it from other people or pass it on. Vitiligo tends to spread over time, often for no apparent reason. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Vitiligo can begin at any age. </span></p>

<p>Every thing was perfect in my life until I was diagnosed with <b>VITILIGO</b>. I have been suffering from vitiligo for the last eleven years, it was really a distress the day it appeared on my face and put me into lot of stress. It was around June 2004 when I was finalizing with my first  Degree in Library and Information Science at Makerere University, Kampala – Uganda, when  I faced this Vitiligo  trauma. It was really a year of great life experience and challenges. My skin from no where started to react, changing from its original birth color uncontrollably especially in the focal parts of my body such as the ; face ,mouth, hair, arms and legs. This caused me a lot of stress as, I had never seen or heard of  this type of skin patches. What even caused me more stress is when I visited skin doctors who could not even know the name of my problem. It was not until I visited the Internet and did my own search that I came to know  the name of this skin patches. It was scientifically termed as <b>VITILIGO</b>.  </p>
<p>...they would just make fun of  me and say; Vivian that is AIDS and it has started on you in the face ,then others could make comments such as; Vivian that skin problem  has no medicine  and cure and it will not get  healed. Others would ask me ; If I think I will ever get married at all? I will also never forget one person who mocked me and said I was a good sacrifice. All such comments from different people and sources distressed me a lot, to the extent that I thought of committing suicide...</p>

</div></div>","HELP US TO RAISE AWARENESS ON VITILIGO IN SELECTED SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
 
Vitiligo is a very complex skin condition, characterised by a sudden loss of melanin in the skin, which turns it milky white in irregular patches.It affects one in every hundred people and can strike anyone at any time, often leading to depression and isolation. Complete knowledge of its etiology has proved elusive, despite decades of intense research. Vitiligo is a chronic, persistent and often progressive disorder - spontaneous repigmentation is uncommon. 

Most people remember Michael Jackson for his great musical talent and astounding star quality. However many people also judged him… for altering the colour of his skin.
The truth is Michael suffered from a condition that many people around the world also have – it’s called Vitiligo. This crowdfunding campaign has been put together to raise awareness and provide support for individuals living with Vitiligo in Sub-Saharan Africa, who struggle everyday with the same problem that MJ faced.

This campaign has been put together



To raise funds for Vitiligo awareness, provide enlightenment and create extensive Vitiligo awareness/enlightenment and education through promotion, marketing and positive PR.


To build capacity and structures and also inaugurate all partner groups of Vitiligo in Select Sub-Saharan Africa, where Vitiligo is still seen as being a curse, a frightening condition, nemesis, anger of the gods and a strange ailment. 


And to give seed funding and possibly stipends to coordinators/Executive Directors.




About Vitiligo
Vitiligo (pronounced vit-ill-EYE-go) is a generally unpredictable skin condition, which results in white patches appearing on the skin. While
the exact cause of vitiligo is unknown, it has been confirmed that an
autoimmune component plays a strong role in the condition. The chronic nature of
the condition, long term treatment, lack of uniform effective therapy and
unpredictable cause of the condition has a significant impact upon the quality
of life of individuals living with vitiligo. It has a devastating effect on social life of the patient and their family.

Vitiligo is a life-long condition and it’s unlikely that you will ever be completely free of it. Vitiligo isn't contagious, so you can't catch it from other people or pass it on. Vitiligo tends to spread over time, often for no apparent reason. Vitiligo can begin at any age. 
   
 

By raising
awareness of Vitiligo and the psychological and negative impact it has on individuals living with it and their families,  we hope to
increase education and understanding and help as many people living with
Vitiligo in and around West and Sub-Saharan Africa as possible. 
Our target is to raise $200,000.                                                                                         Please we need you to
support this campaign by making donations so we can achieve our target, goal and objectives:


Extensive Vitiligo awareness and enlightenment in
     selected African countries


Inauguration of Vitiligo Support groups/organisations
     within the selected countries, with a seed funding and stipends to run.


Capacity building and Positive image workshop for all
     the leaders of the Support groups/organisations.





Please donate what you can and help us achieve these goals.



As a charity we
are constantly seeking support and funds to achieve our objectives. When we
learned about Crowdfunding we felt all of our prayers had been answered. We
truly believe that by opening our campaign up to the entire world, we can
connect with individuals who emphatise with us, individuals living with Vitiligo, their family, friends and colleagues and also give you the chance to support and partner with our
cause. 
Through
crowdfunding we can share our message, raise funds and provide support for
everyone that is living with Vitiligo beginning with our primary target area.

We need to raise $200,000 so that we can support all of our partner organisations and our network of non-profits. Many have been inspired by the Founders journey and are technically supported by VITSAF.
Every $ we raise will go towards our work, our partner organisations and our network, members and stakeholders. We have no major overheads, such as large offices, so you can rest assured every $ will be spent wisely.
Lets work together to reach our goals and change lives.
PLEASE:

Share this campaign online and through your social media platforms
Tell all of your friends and family and anyone you know who has Vitiligo about our mission
Follow us and provide support along the way with messages of encouragement
Promote the benefits of our work in your local community, and across Africa
Remember – PLEASE DONATE whatever you can
Purchase your supporters perks now – while they are available




We are always seeking new partners who wish
to join us on our mission, so please contact us for more information on how to
become a part of our network.
We have
inspired and supported organisations working hard to uplift individuals living with Vitiligo across Sub-Saharan Africa, and if this is as important to you
as it is to them, and us then you should join our community.

I wish to express my gratitude to VISTAF for its commitment and support, to the individuals living Vitiligo in Africa. 
MY EXPERIENCE WITH VITILIGO:
Every thing was perfect in my life until I was diagnosed with VITILIGO. I have been suffering from vitiligo for the last eleven years, it was really a distress the day it appeared on my face and put me into lot of stress. It was around June 2004 when I was finalizing with my first  Degree in Library and Information Science at Makerere University, Kampala – Uganda, when  I faced this Vitiligo  trauma. It was really a year of great life experience and challenges. My skin from no where started to react, changing from its original birth color uncontrollably especially in the focal parts of my body such as the ; face ,mouth, hair, arms and legs. This caused me a lot of stress as, I had never seen or heard of  this type of skin patches. What even caused me more stress is when I visited skin doctors who could not even know the name of my problem. It was not until I visited the Internet and did my own search that I came to know  the name of this skin patches. It was scientifically termed as VITILIGO.  
...they would just make fun of  me and say; Vivian that is AIDS and it has started on you in the face ,then others could make comments such as; Vivian that skin problem  has no medicine  and cure and it will not get  healed. Others would ask me ; If I think I will ever get married at all? I will also never forget one person who mocked me and said I was a good sacrifice. All such comments from different people and sources distressed me a lot, to the extent that I thought of committing suicide...

<p>The people of Africa have suffered for generations due to a lack of adequate medical care. Almost all aspects of healthcare that we in the United States find relatively easy to access are almost impossible to find in that part of the World.</p>
<p>One of the most serious causes of death and disability in Africa are trauma related conditions. Things like broken bones and injuries from car accidents and falls. Since many of the people in this region are subsistence farmers and laborers, any injury that leaves them unable to work usually results in terrible outcomes for the injured and their families. Once the breadwinner is hurt, without treatment and care, an entire circle of people can starve to death! There is no social welfare system to catch them in times of need.</p>
<p>Dr. Joe Marotta is an Orthopedic Surgeon and the head of Medicus Christi, Ltd., a nonprofit organization striving to bring up-to-date injury treatment to the poor and underserved on the African Continent. We aim to bring volunteers to care for devastating traumatic medical problems like broken bones and damaged limbs to people of all ages. Furthermore, we are planning to create training programs to teach the local people how to care for these injuries themselves. Together with the wonderful people of West Africa, we can join forces to make a huge impact.</p>
<p>In June of this year, Dr. Joe is making a fact finding and organizational trip to Ghana, West Africa to establish a relationship with a hospital in that country that is willing to host Medicus Christi’s efforts into the future. That hospital is located in the City of Sunyani which is in the Central Region of Ghana.</p>
<p>We need financial support to pay for this mission and to provide some initial medical supplies for those who need our help.</p>

<p>Are you and your family <b><i>STARVED for vital nutrients</i></b>? According to the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics and the University of Illinois, <b><i>most people are lacking</i></b> of many of the<b><i> 91 essential nutrients</i></b> that science tells us we need to eat everyday.

Are you and your family STARVED for vital nutrients? According to the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics and the University of Illinois, most people are lacking of many of the 91 essential nutrients that science tells us we need to eat everyday. According to the World Health Organization, chronic disease such as high blood pressure, diabetes and cancer are at epidemic growth rates, while at the same time the nutritional value of our food continues to decline. 
It's simple, fully nourished bodies fight disease better than malnourished bodies. Now imagine every essential nutrient the body needs in one delicious daily smoothie mix: Promanatein, a powder nutrient complex. Promanatein itself isn't the cure, with proper nutrition, your body is.
Why did I begin this journey? I believe that the human body was designed to intelligently use nutrients to maintain ideal health.  I believe that our immune system has the ability to avoid chronic disease when properly nourished.  
I asked myself these questions:


What are ALL the essential nutrients our bodies need for proper nutrition? What happens when we don't get all the essential nutrients for many years? Is there one product that contains every essential nutrient?  I found the answers to these questions:


There are 91 essential nutrients:  60 minerals, 16 vitamins, 12 amino acids and 3 fatty acids, and we need each of them EVERY day (that is why they are called essential). 
Not having these nutrients is the very definition of malnutrition. Long term, malnutrition means chronic disease is inevitable. 
I found no product that contains every essential nutrient. Therefore, I saw the need and opportunity to develop my own product - Promanatein.



Promanatein is every essential nutrient, in a convenient powder complex. It is tasty and perfect as a smoothie base or mixed in juice and water. It was designed to be eaten once per day in at least 8 ounces of liquid.  



Promanatein is non-GMO, gluten free, lactose free, vegan friendly, and made from mostly organic ingredients. It is fortified with nutrients from verified ultra pure sources.  It contains, all natural whole food and no preservatives . 
Our product label is still in the works, and should be available soon. 

There are 3 fundamental principles that drive our cause:



All life exists as a result of intelligent design.
Essential nutrients are the building blocks of life.
By design, a reparative synergy occurs when all essential nutrients are present in the human body - at the same time.

... more info about our goals & philosophy are found at www.Promanatein.com




What We Need & What You Get
 We need your support to help this cause. Even if you take a multivitamin, you are likely lacking essential trace minerals and unpopular important vitamins. Proper essential nutrients are critical: If you support us, your body will thank you and so will your family and friends. 
What we need:  We need to buy larger quantities of raw ingredients from our (non-GMO, gluten free and organic [where possible]) quality ingredient sources. 
Demand is greater than our capacity to fulfill, therefore we need to ramp up our production output from our current ""friends and family"" quantities, to production quantity levels.
We need to build our coupon referral marketing initiative.  
100% of your help will go to further this cause and increase our production.    



The Impact & The Perks
 Imagine the difference we can make in people's lives as they start to become properly nourished. Most of them, (perhaps you or your loved ones) will for the first time in their lives experience every nutrient that our body (and our cells) need to adequately replicate and repair itself. 
This is my cause, and hopefully you share it. Lets help you. Lets help your family and your friends. We are so completely committed to you and your health, that if you join us, we will give you long term FREE supplies of Promanatein at every perk level.  Here are some of our Perk gifts:



 
(For further perk details see perk information on the right).    
Risks & Challenges We know Promanatein will face obstacles and challenges. As a veteran entrepreneur (technology and the arts), I have experienced this. I never give up.  I was meant to spearhead this project, and it will be successful. 
Your help will expedite our growth. Without your support, it will simply take longer. The more we raise, the faster we can grow and the faster we help others. 
Already I have impacted my own health and that of my family and friends. This achievement was one of my important life goals.  Together, let's help other friends and families.

These issues are directly or indirectly related to the demise of our natural resources due to human action.  </p><p></p><p>1. Animal food production has released sufficient quantities of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere over the last century that we are now starting to feel the effects of an inevitably warmer world.  Pronounced droughts, floods, wildfires, and storms are happening more frequently, rising seas are inundating coastlines, and climate patterns are reconfigured around the planet. </p><p>2. Radioactive materials, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, nematocides―all of these man-made products kill or harm life. Dangerous radioactive materials last for millennia.  Similarly, the heavy use of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and other toxins continue to have highly deleterious effects on the health and well-being of people and ecosystems. </p><p>3. Overfishing has decimated most fisheries and the oceans are now devoid of over 95% of its larger predatory fish, such as sharks, Bluefin tuna, and billfish. Coral reefs are degrading almost everywhere they occur due to warming and acidifying (caused by more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) seas, overfishing, and sediment- and toxin-laden runoff from the land. In addition, the tons and tons of discarded plastic that ends up in the ocean kills and sickens marine life up and down the food chain. As this plastic breaks down the resulting micro pellets will continue to cause lasting harm in ecosystems.</p><p></p><p>4. A conservative estimate is that well over a hundred species a day are going extinct, with the rate of disappearing species accelerating as natural habitats shrink, fragment, and degrade and commercial exploitation of vulnerable species escalates. The fewer the species remaining on this planet, the more tenuous our own existence.</p><h4>What does all of this have to do with you and me?  </h4><p>As it turns out, everything.  What you decide to consume,  is the ultimate and most powerful form of proactive change.  We must be that change we want to see in the world, but the key is to know exactly which things promote disease and which protect us from it.  Believe me, they are not the ones that mainstream media promote and want you to believe.    </p><p></p><h4>What can be done?</h4>Humanity needs an international effort to regulate and enforce sustainable food, products, services, and a sustainable health system.  It all starts from you and me, what we eat, what we buy, and how we live.  We don't have the luxury to look the other way and not care because it is our children who will live the consequences of our choices.  <p></p><p>Cheap food is cheap for a reason and our lives are not worth the risk. It is simply a slow form of poison for you and I.  It is really ourselves that we are hurting―our bodies, our animals, our oceans, our biodiversity, our natural resources, and our planet in vast proportions. <br/><br/>I invite you to stand up with me in the defense and proliferation of real food.  Food that loves us back. Food that respects mother Earth and food that protects us from chronic diseases.  <br/><br/>Only together we will make a difference.</p><p>Margarita Restrepo<br/>Founder and Editor-in-chief<br/>Naked Food Magazine<br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437149230/l02tcajlp3khi9dcj5bg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p>
<h1>The Facts.</h1>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It is not just cancer.  Did you know that cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, Alzheimer’s, lower respiratory diseases, and Nephritis have one thing in common? They are all linked to nutritional factors.  This simply means that chronic degenerative diseases are not only preventable but in most cases, reversible.</span><br/></p><p></p><ul>
<li>During 2009 and 2010, more than one-third of adults, or about 78 million people, were obese (defined as body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2). Nearly one of five youths aged 2–19 years was obese (BMI ≥95th percentile). <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In the HBO documentary </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Weight of the Nation</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">, it was noted that if you “go with the flow” in the US, you will eventually become obese.</span>
</li>
<li>Seven of the top 10 causes of death in 2010 were chronic diseases. Two of these chronic diseases, heart disease and cancer, together accounted for nearly 48% of all deaths.<br/>
</li>
<li>In <span style=""background-color: initial;"">2011, it was reported that in some areas of the country, the rate of obesity is 39% and is increasing at a rate of 5% per year. </span>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Risks of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, along with their ensuing complications (e.g., behavioral health and quality-of-life problems) often go hand-in-hand and are strongly linked to lifestyle, especially dietary choices. </span></span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Of all the diets recommended over the last few decades to turn the tide of these chronic illnesses, the best but perhaps least common may be those that are plant-based.</span> </span></span></li>

<h1>The Hard Costs.</h1>
<p>The majority of US health care and economic costs associated with medical conditions are for the costs of chronic diseases and conditions and associated health risk behaviors.  Despite the strong body of evidence favoring plant-based diets, including studies showing a willingness of the general public to embrace them, many physicians are not stressing the importance of plant-based diets as a first-line treatment for chronic illnesses. This could be because of a lack of awareness of these diets or a lack of patient education resources.</p>

<h1>The Proof.</h1>
<h4>Obesity.</h4>
<p>In 2006, after reviewing data from 87 published studies, authors Susan E. Berkow, Ph.D. and Neal Barnard, MD reported in Nutrition Reviews that a vegan or vegetarian diet is highly effective for weight loss. They also found that vegetarian populations have lower rates of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. In addition, their review suggests that weight loss in vegetarians is not dependent on exercise and occurs at a rate of approximately 1 pound per week. The authors further stated that a vegan diet caused more calories to be burned after meals, in contrast to non-vegan diets which may cause fewer calories to be burned because the food is being stored as fat.</p>

<br/>
<h4>Heart Disease</h4>
<p>In the Lifestyle Heart Trial, Dr. Dean Ornish found that 82% of patients with diagnosed heart disease who followed his program had some level of regression of atherosclerosis. Comprehensive lifestyle changes appear to be the catalyst that brought about this regression of even severe coronary atherosclerosis after only 1 year. In his plant-based regimen, 10% of calories came from fat, 15% to 20% from protein, and 70% to 75% from carbohydrate and cholesterol was restricted to 5 mg per day.<br/></p>

<p>
</p>
<h4>High Blood Pressure</h4>
<p>In 2010, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee performed a literature review to identify articles examining the effect of dietary patterns on blood pressure in adults. Vegetarian diets were associated with lower systolic blood pressure and lower diastolic blood pressure. One randomized crossover trial found that a Japanese diet (low sodium and plant-based) significantly reduced systolic blood pressure.</p>

<h4>Diabetes</h4>
<p>Plant-based diets may offer an advantage over those that are not plant-based with respect to prevention and management of diabetes. The Adventist Health Studies found that vegetarians have approximately half the risk of developing diabetes as nonvegetarians. In 2008, they reported that nonvegetarians were 74% more likely to develop diabetes over a 17-year period than vegetarians. In 2009, a study involving more than 60,000 men and women found that the prevalence of diabetes in individuals on a vegan diet was 2.9%, compared with 7.6% in the nonvegetarians. A low-fat, plant-based diet with no or little meat may help prevent and treat diabetes, possibly by improving insulin sensitivity and decreasing insulin resistance.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436897826/foz5lfeqz7kja5yncwss.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p>

These issues are directly or indirectly related to the demise of our natural resources due to human action.  1. Animal food production has released sufficient quantities of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere over the last century that we are now starting to feel the effects of an inevitably warmer world.  Pronounced droughts, floods, wildfires, and storms are happening more frequently, rising seas are inundating coastlines, and climate patterns are reconfigured around the planet. 2. Radioactive materials, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, nematocides―all of these man-made products kill or harm life. Dangerous radioactive materials last for millennia.  Similarly, the heavy use of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and other toxins continue to have highly deleterious effects on the health and well-being of people and ecosystems. 3. Overfishing has decimated most fisheries and the oceans are now devoid of over 95% of its larger predatory fish, such as sharks, Bluefin tuna, and billfish. Coral reefs are degrading almost everywhere they occur due to warming and acidifying (caused by more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) seas, overfishing, and sediment- and toxin-laden runoff from the land. In addition, the tons and tons of discarded plastic that ends up in the ocean kills and sickens marine life up and down the food chain. As this plastic breaks down the resulting micro pellets will continue to cause lasting harm in ecosystems.4. A conservative estimate is that well over a hundred species a day are going extinct, with the rate of disappearing species accelerating as natural habitats shrink, fragment, and degrade and commercial exploitation of vulnerable species escalates. The fewer the species remaining on this planet, the more tenuous our own existence.What does all of this have to do with you and me?  As it turns out, everything.  What you decide to consume,  is the ultimate and most powerful form of proactive change.  We must be that change we want to see in the world, but the key is to know exactly which things promote disease and which protect us from it.  Believe me, they are not the ones that mainstream media promote and want you to believe.    What can be done?Humanity needs an international effort to regulate and enforce sustainable food, products, services, and a sustainable health system.  It all starts from you and me, what we eat, what we buy, and how we live.  We don't have the luxury to look the other way and not care because it is our children who will live the consequences of our choices.  Cheap food is cheap for a reason and our lives are not worth the risk. It is simply a slow form of poison for you and I.  It is really ourselves that we are hurting―our bodies, our animals, our oceans, our biodiversity, our natural resources, and our planet in vast proportions. I invite you to stand up with me in the defense and proliferation of real food.  Food that loves us back. Food that respects mother Earth and food that protects us from chronic diseases.  Only together we will make a difference.Margarita RestrepoFounder and Editor-in-chiefNaked Food Magazine
The Facts.
It is not just cancer.  Did you know that cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, Alzheimer’s, lower respiratory diseases, and Nephritis have one thing in common? They are all linked to nutritional factors.  This simply means that chronic degenerative diseases are not only preventable but in most cases, reversible.
During 2009 and 2010, more than one-third of adults, or about 78 million people, were obese (defined as body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2). Nearly one of five youths aged 2–19 years was obese (BMI ≥95th percentile). In the HBO documentary The Weight of the Nation, it was noted that if you “go with the flow” in the US, you will eventually become obese.

Seven of the top 10 causes of death in 2010 were chronic diseases. Two of these chronic diseases, heart disease and cancer, together accounted for nearly 48% of all deaths.

In 2011, it was reported that in some areas of the country, the rate of obesity is 39% and is increasing at a rate of 5% per year. 

Risks of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, along with their ensuing complications (e.g., behavioral health and quality-of-life problems) often go hand-in-hand and are strongly linked to lifestyle, especially dietary choices. 
Of all the diets recommended over the last few decades to turn the tide of these chronic illnesses, the best but perhaps least common may be those that are plant-based. 




The Hard Costs.
The majority of US health care and economic costs associated with medical conditions are for the costs of chronic diseases and conditions and associated health risk behaviors.  Despite the strong body of evidence favoring plant-based diets, including studies showing a willingness of the general public to embrace them, many physicians are not stressing the importance of plant-based diets as a first-line treatment for chronic illnesses. This could be because of a lack of awareness of these diets or a lack of patient education resources.



Eighty-four percent of all health care spending in 2006 was for the 50% of the population who have one or more chronic medical conditions. 


The total costs of heart disease and stroke in 2010 were estimated to be $315.4 billion. Of this amount, $193.4 billion was for direct medical costs, not including costs of nursing home care.


Cancer care cost $157 billion in 2010 dollars.


The total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2012 was $245 billion, including $176 billion in direct medical costs and $69 billion in decreased productivity. Decreased productivity includes costs associated with people being absent from work, being less productive while at work, or not being able to work at all because of diabetes. 






The Proof.
Obesity.
In 2006, after reviewing data from 87 published studies, authors Susan E. Berkow, Ph.D. and Neal Barnard, MD reported in Nutrition Reviews that a vegan or vegetarian diet is highly effective for weight loss. They also found that vegetarian populations have lower rates of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. In addition, their review suggests that weight loss in vegetarians is not dependent on exercise and occurs at a rate of approximately 1 pound per week. The authors further stated that a vegan diet caused more calories to be burned after meals, in contrast to non-vegan diets which may cause fewer calories to be burned because the food is being stored as fat.

In his plant-based regimen, 10% of calories came from fat, 15% to 20% from protein, and 70% to 75% from carbohydrate and cholesterol was restricted to 5 mg per day.



High Blood Pressure
In 2010, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee performed a literature review to identify articles examining the effect of dietary patterns on blood pressure in adults. Vegetarian diets were associated with lower systolic blood pressure and lower diastolic blood pressure. One randomized crossover trial found that a Japanese diet (low sodium and plant-based) significantly reduced systolic blood pressure.

<p><b>THE BEGINNING</b></p><p>I have a small tight-knit family. The four of us -- my mom, dad, brother and myself -- have gone through everything together. In fact, there was little to no mystery in our two bedroom beach bungalow in Santa Cruz, CA. Everyday, my Dad, a self employed real estate appraiser, would be working hard to support our family.</p><p>My brother, Conor, is my role model. He introduced me to golf when I was eight years old. Every day after school, I would go to DeLaveaga, my local golf course, with Conor and practice until sunset. Golf was becoming my life. Soon, I was focusing all my efforts on junior golf tournaments, and after three years I began competing around the county as a part of the Santa Cruz County Junior Golf Association. </p><p><b>NEXT STEPS</b></p><p>It would become clear to me in 2008/2009 that I had potential to pursue my dream of playing Division I college golf. In my first appearance at the US Junior Amateur tournament at Shoal Creek, I qualified for matchplay. I won the Trusted Choice Big I California State Junior at my home course, DeLaveaga, followed by a second place finish in Junior Nationals at Dornick Hills Country Club in Ardmore, Oklahoma. Through my second place finish, I was exempt into Junior Nationals the following year at Old Yorke Country Club in New Jersey where I was fortunate to have another second place finish, shooting a course record final round 8- under par, 64. </p><p><b>COLLEGE GOLF</b></p><p>My college golf career began with a top-ten program, at the University of Washington -- where I received a full athletic scholarship. As a freshman, I played in every tournament, highlighted by a fourth place finish in UCLA's tournament  at CordeValle. After my sophomore year at the University of Washington, I decided it was time for a change. I transferred to the University of San Francisco, Conor's alma mater, where I seized the opportunity to become the team's top golfer.</p><p><b>AMATEUR GOLF</b></p><p>The summer of 2013 was the highlight of my golf career thus far. I ended my semester of college golf with a top 10 finish at NCAA Mid-West regionals. That finish gave me the confidence for what was to come.

</div></div>","THE BEGINNINGI have a small tight-knit family. The four of us -- my mom, dad, brother and myself -- have gone through everything together. In fact, there was little to no mystery in our two bedroom beach bungalow in Santa Cruz, CA. Everyday, my Dad, a self employed real estate appraiser, would be working hard to support our family.My brother, Conor, is my role model. He introduced me to golf when I was eight years old. Every day after school, I would go to DeLaveaga, my local golf course, with Conor and practice until sunset. Golf was becoming my life. Soon, I was focusing all my efforts on junior golf tournaments, and after three years I began competing around the county as a part of the Santa Cruz County Junior Golf Association. NEXT STEPSIt would become clear to me in 2008/2009 that I had potential to pursue my dream of playing Division I college golf. In my first appearance at the US Junior Amateur tournament at Shoal Creek, I qualified for matchplay. I won the Trusted Choice Big I California State Junior at my home course, DeLaveaga, followed by a second place finish in Junior Nationals at Dornick Hills Country Club in Ardmore, Oklahoma. Through my second place finish, I was exempt into Junior Nationals the following year at Old Yorke Country Club in New Jersey where I was fortunate to have another second place finish, shooting a course record final round 8- under par, 64. COLLEGE GOLFMy college golf career began with a top-ten program, at the University of Washington -- where I received a full athletic scholarship. As a freshman, I played in every tournament, highlighted by a fourth place finish in UCLA's tournament  at CordeValle. After my sophomore year at the University of Washington, I decided it was time for a change. I transferred to the University of San Francisco, Conor's alma mater, where I seized the opportunity to become the team's top golfer.AMATEUR GOLFThe summer of 2013 was the highlight of my golf career thus far. I ended my semester of college golf with a top 10 finish at NCAA Mid-West regionals. That finish gave me the confidence for what was to come. I began my summer with advancing through US Open Local Qualifying at Half Moon Bay Golf Course, moving onto US Open Regionals in Newport, California. After rounds of 69, 69, I ended up in a three man playoff for two spots where I advanced to the 113th US Open at Merion Golf Club in Philadelphia. Although I was unable to make the cut at the US Open, competing with the worlds top players made me realize I had the game to make a living as a professional golfer. The day after returning from Philadelphia, I competed in the first round of the California State Amateur where six days later I would take the title in the 36 hole final.  After my victory in the California State Amateur, I earned a top 100 world amateur ranking which exempted me into the worlds top amateur events. My high tournament finishes that summer included a second place finish at the Pacific Coast Amateur, advancement to the round of 16 at the Western Amateur and advancement to matchplay in the US Amateur. By the end of the summer of 2013, my world amateur ranking vaulted as high as #13.PROFESSIONAL GOLFI have since turned professional, and am chasing my dream at the highest level.  I have no doubt I will be able to continue to achieve success as a pro, but along with my hard work comes expenses for travel and entry fees along the way.  Join my team.  Help me achieve my goals and lets have some fun along the way.  I am hoping to put together a small group of partners for this journey.  You can contact my agent Brent Brockermeyer at Brent@yeedubin.com if you are interested in having your company logo on my clothes or golf bag, or for more information. Thank you!CORY MCELYEA IN THE MEDIA

Journal To Save Your Life thrives with YOU, our Donors!Hi! My name is Jasper Faolan, and as a Psychiatric Nurse in an acute care facility, I see every DAY how important mental health is, and how much we lack quality mental health programs in this country. With my mother, Dr. Susan Werstein, we have developed a forever-free, 1-52 week mental health program for girls & women aged 13-25. We're ready to launch with five new organizations around the nation - and I'm asking you to please help fund some key employees so that I can keep doing ALL the work I/we do. :) Thank you for your consideration.Please consider donating, Lovely! You are loved!!
Have a beautiful day, & dance all around after you donate, ok? :) OK. Thank you!~Jasper.

JOURNAL TO SAVE YOUR LIFE (J2SYL) is a 52 week, Forever-Free, research-based mental health app that is set to rock (y)our world!

J2SYL: Art HEALS. Cognitive Reframing HEALS. Social Skills HEAL. We are ready for our next phase.

As always, we can only happen with you. Are you with us?

In 2013 - 2014, we gifted $17,000+ of YOUR DONOR DOLLARS and hired OLIVE DESIGN of Austin, Texas and Successfully BUILT www.J2SYL.org: A comprehensive, six-part, totally kick ass, accessible APP & online mental health program for girls and women. J2SYL.org is for those who want to be even stronger in their minds ~ and therefore their communities. We're expanding to boys & men next year.


We need your help! Please support us so that we can carry out our Mutual mission to provide more quality mental health services to the world. Please.









Why you should care about us! ;)
In Journal TO SAVE YOUR LIFE's SIX PART online mental health app, we highlight life aspects a young person may need to look at in order to develop their OWN healthy sense of self.
Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood (ages 12 - 25) represent a key point of brain development in which self-destructive psychological patterns can be identified and addressed, so J2SYL.org strikes this phase while it's hot. J2SYL.org doesn't shy from anything ~ because we know we can make it through anything.

Why now?
The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES states that in 2012, $2.5 billion dollars of need (43.7 MILLION Adults & 3.1 MILLION youth) received mental health services, but $9 billion dollars of Need for mental health services was NOT met.

<h2>Safe Teamwork: Protege a tu equipo de trabajo del COVID-19.</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Safe Teamwork monitorea el bienestar de tus colaboradores así como los espacios de trabajo para garantizar la salud y seguridad de tu empresa.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Nuestra misión es ayudar a los negocios a mantenerse abiertos y seguros.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>¿Recuerdas el día que todo esto empezó? ¿El día que tuviste que decirle a tus empleados que trabajaran desde casa? ¿O simplemente cerrar tu negocio y despedirte de tus trabajadores leales debido a la pandemia? Nosotros lo recordamos claramente, porque ese día, comenzamos a pensar en crear una solución para ayudar a reabrir los negocios de manera segura.</p>
<p>Como gerentes o administradores de negocio, necesitamos saber quién está en riesgo o quién ha sido afectado por el COVID-19, ya que las empresas por ley tienen el deber de cuidar a sus empleados.</p>
<p>No completar una evaluación de riesgos que tenga en cuenta el COVID-19, podría constituir una infracción de la ley de salud y seguridad en el trabajo.</p>
<p>Safe Teamwork incluye una evaluación de riesgo individual para cada empleado que ayuda a abordar este problems. Además, si un empleado resulta positivo para COVID-19, se debe notificar al encargado para que pueda coordinar los implementos necesarios para el trabajo desde casa y también lleve el informe correspondiente a las autoridades de salud y seguridad.</p>
<p>Safe Teamwork incluye una función de notificación de incidentes para que esta información se centralice y se realice un seguimiento adecuado.</p> <p><strong>Creemos firmemente que la única forma de reactivar la economía y mantener seguros a los trabajadores implica lo siguiente:</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong>. Contar con una normativa clara y mecanismos de seguimiento que permitan mantener las condiciones de bioseguridad adecuadas para prevenir la propagación del virus.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Sensibilizar a las personas ante esta nueva realidad y mantener el autocuidado y respeto a dichas normas.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Empresas que puedan asegurar que sus espacios de trabajo cumplan con las normas y que valoren el bienestar y la salud de sus trabajadores.</p>
<p>Para poner en marcha estos 3 elementos proponemos el uso de la tecnología, que facilita los procesos y al mismo tiempo genera hábitos positivos en las personas tanto en los espacios de trabajo como en el hogar.</p>
<p>Para solucionar los problemas antes mencionados, hemos desarrollado una solución tecnológica llamada Safe Teamwork, que combina una plataforma web y una aplicación móvil para gestionar de forma integral las operaciones de empresas u organizaciones en el contexto de la pandemia.</p>
<p>Queremos luchar contra Covid-19 mejorando la comunicación en los equipos, capacitando a todos para que estén atentos al enemigo invisible: ¡El Coronavirus!</p> <h2>¿Qué es Safe Teamwork?</h2> <p>Safe Teamwork es una aplicación que verifica la salud por medio de un sistema de auto-reportes que monitorea al personal y los espacios de trabajo.</p>
<p>El sistema es fácil de configurar y económico de operar.</p> <p>Protegemos tu privacidad al no necesitar de Bluetooth o GPS para saber tu ubicación.</p> <p><strong>Safe Teamwork es una aplicación web y móvil con 4 elementos principales:</strong></p> <ol>
<li>Creación de perfiles de riesgo epidemiológico para los empleados.</li>
<li>Comprobador de síntomas para COVID-19.</li>
<li>Monitoreo de los empleados y espacios de trabajo.</li>
<li>Registro y reporte de infecciones.</li>
</ol> <p><strong>Información importante de acerca de la privacidad</strong></p>
<p>La aplicación sigue el Reglamento General de Protección de Datos (RGPD) que es un reglamento de la ley de la UE sobre la protección de datos y privacidad. Hemos optado por seguir este reglamento para ofrecer la máxima protección a nuestros usuarios.</p>
<p>Los perfiles de riesgo de los empleados son anonimizados y no se almacenan como información personal. En cambio, se calcula y se asigna un factor de riesgo a cada empleado. En la política de privacidad se documenta el uso de la información personal guardada para cada usuario.</p>
<p>La arquitectura del sistema utiliza bases de datos separadas por empresa, para que un intruso en una empresa no tenga acceso a la información de otras. Además, la información está cifrada a nivel de base de datos con claves de seguridad específicas del usuario y mecanismos de rotación, de modo que la información personal está protegida de accesos no autorizados.</p> <h2>¿Cómo funciona?</h2>
<p>Safe Teamwork sigue el mismo principio de la aplicación COVID Symptom Study, una de las herramientas más innovadoras del Reino Unido en la lucha contra COVID-19 y que es también  el estudio de COVID más grande del mundo.</p>
<p>Con Safe Teamwork, cada miembro del equipo responde tres preguntas sencillas:</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>. ¿Cómo te sientes hoy físicamente?</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> ¿Desde dónde planeas trabajar hoy?</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> ¿Te sientes seguro al regresar al lugar de trabajo? (Si trabaja en el sitio)</p> <h2>¡Usa STW en 5 pasos!</h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Crea una cuenta para tu empresa</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Invita a tu equipo a tu empresa</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Tu equipo acepta la invitación</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Tú y tus compañeros de trabajo envían informes diarios rápidos </p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> ¡Mira actualizaciones importantes en un solo lugar y actúa!</p> <p><strong>Utilizando esta información podrás:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> Detectar los síntomas de COVID de manera temprana para aislar a los miembros infectados del equipo.</li>
<li>Monitorear la salud de tu equipo.</li>
<li>Monitorear la ocupación máxima de varios lugares de trabajo.</li>
<li>Comprender el sentimiento del equipo sobre el regreso al lugar de trabajo.</li>
</ol> <h2>Beneficios</h2>
<p>Nuestra solución beneficia tanto a los empleados como a los gerentes de las empresas</p>
<ul>
<li>Los empleados se sienten seguros en su espacio de trabajo</li>
<li>Tiene un sistema de auto reporte con mínima intrusión en la privacidad de los trabajadores.</li>
<li>Los administradores pueden monitorear a los empleados y hacer un manejo adecuado de los espacios de trabajo.</li>
<li>Es fácil de adoptar y tiene bajo costo de operación.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Futuras características </h2>
<p>Con tu contribución planeamos implementar las siguientes características:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gestión segura de turnos</li>
<li>Rastreador de prueba / vacuna</li>
<li>Previsión de hotspots</li>
<li>Planificación de espacios de trabajo</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>¿Quién puede usar STW?</h2>

Safe Teamwork: Protege a tu equipo de trabajo del COVID-19.
 
Safe Teamwork monitorea el bienestar de tus colaboradores así como los espacios de trabajo para garantizar la salud y seguridad de tu empresa.
 
Nuestra misión es ayudar a los negocios a mantenerse abiertos y seguros.
 
¿Recuerdas el día que todo esto empezó? ¿El día que tuviste que decirle a tus empleados que trabajaran desde casa? ¿O simplemente cerrar tu negocio y despedirte de tus trabajadores leales debido a la pandemia? Nosotros lo recordamos claramente, porque ese día, comenzamos a pensar en crear una solución para ayudar a reabrir los negocios de manera segura.
Como gerentes o administradores de negocio, necesitamos saber quién está en riesgo o quién ha sido afectado por el COVID-19, ya que las empresas por ley tienen el deber de cuidar a sus empleados.
No completar una evaluación de riesgos que tenga en cuenta el COVID-19, podría constituir una infracción de la ley de salud y seguridad en el trabajo.
Safe Teamwork incluye una evaluación de riesgo individual para cada empleado que ayuda a abordar este problems. Además, si un empleado resulta positivo para COVID-19, se debe notificar al encargado para que pueda coordinar los implementos necesarios para el trabajo desde casa y también lleve el informe correspondiente a las autoridades de salud y seguridad.
Safe Teamwork incluye una función de notificación de incidentes para que esta información se centralice y se realice un seguimiento adecuado. Creemos firmemente que la única forma de reactivar la economía y mantener seguros a los trabajadores implica lo siguiente: 1. Contar con una normativa clara y mecanismos de seguimiento que permitan mantener las condiciones de bioseguridad adecuadas para prevenir la propagación del virus.
2. Sensibilizar a las personas ante esta nueva realidad y mantener el autocuidado y respeto a dichas normas.
3. Empresas que puedan asegurar que sus espacios de trabajo cumplan con las normas y que valoren el bienestar y la salud de sus trabajadores.
Para poner en marcha estos 3 elementos proponemos el uso de la tecnología, que facilita los procesos y al mismo tiempo genera hábitos positivos en las personas tanto en los espacios de trabajo como en el hogar.
Para solucionar los problemas antes mencionados, hemos desarrollado una solución tecnológica llamada Safe Teamwork, que combina una plataforma web y una aplicación móvil para gestionar de forma integral las operaciones de empresas u organizaciones en el contexto de la pandemia.
Queremos luchar contra Covid-19 mejorando la comunicación en los equipos, capacitando a todos para que estén atentos al enemigo invisible: ¡El Coronavirus! ¿Qué es Safe Teamwork? Safe Teamwork es una aplicación que verifica la salud por medio de un sistema de auto-reportes que monitorea al personal y los espacios de trabajo.
El sistema es fácil de configurar y económico de operar. Protegemos tu privacidad al no necesitar de Bluetooth o GPS para saber tu ubicación. Safe Teamwork es una aplicación web y móvil con 4 elementos principales: 
Creación de perfiles de riesgo epidemiológico para los empleados.
Comprobador de síntomas para COVID-19.
Monitoreo de los empleados y espacios de trabajo.
Registro y reporte de infecciones.
 Información importante de acerca de la privacidad
La aplicación sigue el Reglamento General de Protección de Datos (RGPD) que es un reglamento de la ley de la UE sobre la protección de datos y privacidad. Hemos optado por seguir este reglamento para ofrecer la máxima protección a nuestros usuarios.
Los perfiles de riesgo de los empleados son anonimizados y no se almacenan como información personal. En cambio, se calcula y se asigna un factor de riesgo a cada empleado. En la política de privacidad se documenta el uso de la información personal guardada para cada usuario.
La arquitectura del sistema utiliza bases de datos separadas por empresa, para que un intruso en una empresa no tenga acceso a la información de otras. Además, la información está cifrada a nivel de base de datos con claves de seguridad específicas del usuario y mecanismos de rotación, de modo que la información personal está protegida de accesos no autorizados. ¿Cómo funciona?
Safe Teamwork sigue el mismo principio de la aplicación COVID Symptom Study, una de las herramientas más innovadoras del Reino Unido en la lucha contra COVID-19 y que es también  el estudio de COVID más grande del mundo.
Con Safe Teamwork, cada miembro del equipo responde tres preguntas sencillas:
1. ¿Cómo te sientes hoy físicamente?
2. ¿Desde dónde planeas trabajar hoy?
3. ¿Te sientes seguro al regresar al lugar de trabajo? (Si trabaja en el sitio) ¡Usa STW en 5 pasos!
1. Crea una cuenta para tu empresa
2. Invita a tu equipo a tu empresa
3. Tu equipo acepta la invitación
4. Tú y tus compañeros de trabajo envían informes diarios rápidos 
5. ¡Mira actualizaciones importantes en un solo lugar y actúa! Utilizando esta información podrás:

 Detectar los síntomas de COVID de manera temprana para aislar a los miembros infectados del equipo.
Monitorear la salud de tu equipo.
Monitorear la ocupación máxima de varios lugares de trabajo.
Comprender el sentimiento del equipo sobre el regreso al lugar de trabajo.
 Beneficios
Nuestra solución beneficia tanto a los empleados como a los gerentes de las empresas

Los empleados se sienten seguros en su espacio de trabajo
Tiene un sistema de auto reporte con mínima intrusión en la privacidad de los trabajadores.
Los administradores pueden monitorear a los empleados y hacer un manejo adecuado de los espacios de trabajo.
Es fácil de adoptar y tiene bajo costo de operación.

</ul></div>","We notice the importance of hygiene practices. Young kids, the elderly, adults with weak immunity and even smokers are at higher risk of infection. We have launched CleanAire, the world’s first portable product that incorporates ozone and Ultraviolet C (UVC) rays for combined sterilisation. With its dual disinfection capabilities, CleanAire provides users with 360° protection against germs in the immediate environment, thoroughly sterilising the air and surface areas within a  2 square meter (21.5 square feet) radius. Let's protect the health of you and your loved ones!How It WorksWhen exposed to germs, UVC rays compromise their DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (Ribonucleic acid) structures, stopping reproduction and interaction with human cells. By emitting UVC rays from a concealed and harmless light source, CleanAire provides users with protection while using the product. Providing an extensive approach to sterilisation, CleanAire also comes with a built-in ozone generator. The ozone generated into the air is able to bypass shielded areas as well as obstacles and sets off a biochemical oxidation reaction that destroys the DNA and RNA of germs.Usage InstructionsOffering a user-friendly interface and not to mention a sleek and chic design, CleanAire is created to operate with just one touch power switch. To start using CleanAire, touch and hold the power switch – located at the top of the device – for 5 seconds and let it run its course. You will see the atmosphere lamp of the cartoon rabbit and UV tube light up while the device is running. CleanAire will thoroughly sterilise the air and surface for 30 minutes at a time, and will automatically shut off upon completion of its task.

To charge the device fully, simply connect it to a USB cable and power source for 2 – 3 hours. During charging, the power indicator will flash regularly. Once fully charged, the indicator will stop flashing. Each full charge will yield up to 15 rounds of automatic sterilisation.
Please note:

Ozone smell may be detected while the device is working in a closed area. Once sterilization is done, ozone will gradually turn to oxygen and leave no smell. 
There will be low static noise from the ozone generator while the device is working.

Application Scenarios

The portable nature of CleanAire allows for various applications across multiple scenarios and locations. Measuring at just 120 mm x 56 mm (4.7 in x 2.2 in), CleanAire can fit comfortably in backpacks, handbags and any luggage for ease of carrying.
CleanAire can also be placed on desks at work to clean the air in the immediate vicinity; given that workstations are places most people spend substantial amounts of time apart from personal spaces such as homes.Regardless of dining in or out, the compact nature of the device makes it convenient to place on the dining table for sterilisation while eating, offering comprehensive protection within the immediate area.With cars being another location that we frequent and regularly interact with others at, it is vital to disinfect the interiors as thoroughly as possible. Turn on CleanAire and leave it working for 30 minutes while running errands, further maximising time spent.Apart from open areas, CleanAire can also be used in small spaces such as wardrobes and cabinets. Before the contents are used, let CleanAire clean the air within the storage area and on the objects to increase further protection.While bathrooms are usually associated with personal hygiene. Take action and prevent incubation by disinfecting bathrooms with CleanAire.TestimonialsSpecifications CertificationCleanAire has been certified by the Guangdong Detection Centre of Microbiology to have maximum sterilisation rates of 99.9%.ShippingOur product is ready for shipping to United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Hongkong, and Singapore.

<h3>Why Are We Making A Cardio Turf War Fitness App/Game?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623185070/hqcef5qmtouk6wbks90j.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We're raising $10,000 to build an MVP for our social, gamified cardio fitness app. Why?</p>
<p>Well, let's be real: <strong>Cardio is boring. Like really, really boring...</strong></p>
<p>As a bored college kid stuck in his apartment during quarantine during the global-health-crisis-that-shant-be-named, my cardio fitness plan of amateur 5-on-5 basketball &amp; running to the bars was disrupted. And in its place was a fate I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy: running by myself.</p>
<p>It was awful...so I tried to spice it up with other cardio fitness apps. And they were equally awful!</p>
<p>Sadly, most of the apps you can use for tracking your cardio activities and workouts are equally boring. <strong>What's the point of using an app to track your cardio if you don't feel inspired enough to get out there and do the workout at all?</strong> While there are dozens of apps that offer leaderboards to show off your vanity metrics, and apps that offer gimmicks you engage with by yourself, there are few options that make cardio a social and gamified experience while rewarding everyone, whether they run marathons daily or walk their dog down the block.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">So we're changing that!</span></p>
<p>Introducing <strong>Cardii.io</strong> (Pronounced ""Cardio""), the newest way to turn something most people hate into something fun, engaging, competitive, and collaborative, by <strong>turning your running, walking, and biking into turf you fight for with your friends against your foes!</strong></p>
<p>So what makes our app different to the dozens that already exist in the cardio fitness space? How will we create an experience so fun people who hate cardio will want to get outside and move?</p>
<p>Great question!</p>
<p>Our focus is strictly on creating a fun, dynamic community around cardio, with these primary factors being the core of our product:</p>
<ul>
<li>Socially collaborative &amp; competitive community letting you engage with people in your area, and beyond in your cardio workouts</li>
<li>Interact with teammates and opposing teams in your city &amp; beyond!</li>
<li><p>Direct message friends &amp; foes, as well as create Reddit-style threads to chat with your teammates!</p></li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Running, Biking, Walking? It doesn't matter - our app is made to make whatever cardio you do fun &amp; dynamic! Whether you're walking your dog, running a marathon, or anything in-between, you can capture turf &amp; make whatever you do a bit more fun!</li>
<li>Gamified experience more about enjoying your cardio method of choice than forcing you to be a marathoner or sprinter!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Beyond being a fun way to get your cardio in, the real impact we want to make with this app is creating an environment where those (like me) who suck at doing cardio consistently become inspired &amp; even excited to get out and move.</p>
<p>Whether it be mid-afternoon, a quick 10 min jog down the road, or even walking your dog, we hope to create a digital community of casual exercisers that feel motivated to get out and do something everyday with friends in their area and beyond it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are several risk here. For one, there are dozens of other cardio fitness apps out there. There is also an app that is similar in nature to what we do we turf capturing - however, we feel like we can not only compete with these apps, but conquer them. Only about 41% of runners consistently use apps as of June 2020, and those who didn't said it was mainly because of ""a lack of utility"". In other words, tracking their stats and repetitive feedback loop type of games were boring to them, and therefore wasn't enough for them to use an app. However, for products that can transcend only that utility (Peloton, Nike Run Club, and others) they become widely used &amp; retain their users. Our strategy has been tested with over 60 user interviews from different personas, with months of research, fine-tuning, and crafting. We've also earned advisory from the Founder of Map My Run, a cardio fitness app acquired by Under Armor for $150 million, as well as from former Pokemon Go Engineers &amp; Peloton executives. With our research, our team, and our advisory, we believe our product can be successful in the market, and help million become more consistent in their cardio fitness by making it fun!</p>

</div></div>","Why Are We Making A Cardio Turf War Fitness App/Game?

We're raising $10,000 to build an MVP for our social, gamified cardio fitness app. Why?
Well, let's be real: Cardio is boring. Like really, really boring...
As a bored college kid stuck in his apartment during quarantine during the global-health-crisis-that-shant-be-named, my cardio fitness plan of amateur 5-on-5 basketball & running to the bars was disrupted. And in its place was a fate I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy: running by myself.
It was awful...so I tried to spice it up with other cardio fitness apps. And they were equally awful!
Sadly, most of the apps you can use for tracking your cardio activities and workouts are equally boring. What's the point of using an app to track your cardio if you don't feel inspired enough to get out there and do the workout at all? While there are dozens of apps that offer leaderboards to show off your vanity metrics, and apps that offer gimmicks you engage with by yourself, there are few options that make cardio a social and gamified experience while rewarding everyone, whether they run marathons daily or walk their dog down the block.
So we're changing that!
Introducing Cardii.io (Pronounced ""Cardio""), the newest way to turn something most people hate into something fun, engaging, competitive, and collaborative, by turning your running, walking, and biking into turf you fight for with your friends against your foes!
So what makes our app different to the dozens that already exist in the cardio fitness space? How will we create an experience so fun people who hate cardio will want to get outside and move?
Great question!
Our focus is strictly on creating a fun, dynamic community around cardio, with these primary factors being the core of our product:

Socially collaborative & competitive community letting you engage with people in your area, and beyond in your cardio workouts
Interact with teammates and opposing teams in your city & beyond!
Direct message friends & foes, as well as create Reddit-style threads to chat with your teammates!



 

Running, Biking, Walking? It doesn't matter - our app is made to make whatever cardio you do fun & dynamic! Whether you're walking your dog, running a marathon, or anything in-between, you can capture turf & make whatever you do a bit more fun!
Gamified experience more about enjoying your cardio method of choice than forcing you to be a marathoner or sprinter!

 

 
Leaderboards and scoring systems centered around activity, team success, and strategy over speed, distance
 

 
App customizations for your avatar, claimed territory, forming teams and personal fitness goals setting to make your experience exactly what you want it!
 


 
Finish challenges based around your cardio methods of choice!
 


What We Need & What You Get
We are raising $10,000 over the next 30 days. Funding will be used to bring on a full-time dev to finish our prototype and raise our pre-seed, whether we hit our goal or not!
For perks, we are offering people...

<td width=""200px""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><b>What is EverSleep?</b></span></td>
<td>EverSleep is the world’s most advanced consumer sleep tracker. We use hospital-grade infra-red oximetry technology to monitor your blood oxygen level 30 times per second while you sleep. We combine this with pulse rate measurement, snore, and movement to generate a complete physiological analysis of your night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><b>How will EverSleep's Coaching help me sleep better?</b></span></td>
<td>EverSleep gathers much more information than other sleep trackers, AND we correlate those measurements with profile and nightly questions that you answer.   For example, did you know that some insomnia is caused by breathing disruption?  If we measure several breathing disruptions in the few minutes before you wake up with middle-of-the-night insomnia, AND you’ve answered “yes” to a question about ""allergies, stuffy nose, or other breathing difficulties"", EverSleep coaches you to try an over-the-counter allergy medication.  Often clearing your sinus will prevent the insomnia!  In another interesting example, did you know that fast pulse rate episodes can “fragment” your sleep, causing you to lose precious “quality” sleep time?  If we measure several fast pulse rate episodes, we can calculate how much quality sleep you’ve “lost” due to those episodes.  Now, if you’ve answered “yes” to the question “I’ve had caffeine after lunch”, we correlate the fast pulse rate episodes to the caffeine consumption.  Maybe you are especially sensitive to caffeine but don’t know it - many people are.  This is why you THINK you slept 8 hours, but really only had a few hours of quality sleep.  Our coaching would be to try a few nights without caffeine, and wear the EverSleep again.  We bet you’ll sleep better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><b>Why is EverSleep different than other sleep trackers?</b></span></td>
<td>Wearable trackers like the FitBit, Apple Watch, Jawbone, Polar, Withings, Beddit, Misfit, etc., can only measure your movement while you sleep - they rate your sleep by how much you move. EverSleep measures your blood oxygen level, pulse rate, snore, AND movement to help you determine WHY you are sleeping badly.  Then it gives detailed COACHING tips to help with your specific problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><b>What is Sleep Fragmentation?</b></span></td>
<td>People generally sleep in 4 stages.   Stage one is light sleep, typically the first ten minutes of sleeping.  Stage two is about 40 minutes of moderate sleep, your body is getting ready to restore itself!  Stage three is where the serious restorative work happens.  REM sleep usually follows stage 3.   Now, ANY INTERRUPTION in this pattern and you have to “go back” to stage 1 and start over!  This is the problem with sleep apnea, pulse rate “spikes”, involuntary movements, breathing disruptions, insomnias, etc.  They “fragment” your sleep, and cause you to “start over” all night!  This is why you can stay in bed for 8 hours, and you think you’ve been asleep but you didn’t get the QUALITY sleep that you needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><b>What is Sleep Apnea?</b></span></td>
<td>Sleep Apnea is a condition where the soft tissue in your tongue and throat collapses as your muscles relax during sleep. This restriction in your breathing causes snoring, reduced oxygen levels (hypopnea), or even a complete closure of your airway, literally leaving you choking or gasping for air many times per night. Millions of Americans today have undiagnosed sleep apnea, which left untreated, can lead to chronic inflammation and a slew of other medical problems. Sleep apnea is linked to a number of serious chronic diseases, including: Diabetes, Drug Resistant Hypertension / High Blood Pressure, Heart Attack, Stroke, Congestive Heart Failure, and Obesity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><b>How do I know if I need EverSleep?</b></span></td>
<td>Do you Snore? Are you a restless or ""Light"" Sleeper?  Do you have trouble falling or staying asleep?  Are you tired during the day? Does your spouse say you seem to stop breathing during the night?  Do you have sleep apnea?  Do you have a CPAP machine and want to monitor your oxygen levels over time? Are you exercising and eating right, and now want to measure sleep improvements?   If you answered YES to any of the above, EverSleep is for you. EverSleep can do all of this in the palm of your hand because it is the only sleep tracker to measure your oxygen levels continuously during the night, with the added benefit of NO ongoing fees or subscriptions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><b>You mentioned blood oxygen, does EverSleep use needles or draw your blood?</b></span></td>
<td>EverSleep is completely non-invasive, there are no needles or blood, nothing penetrates your skin. It is completely painless. We use highly calibrated red and infra-red LED lights to “look through” your finger with an advanced light sensor, and then calculate your real-time blood oxygen level. It is sensitive enough to see the changes in your oxygen levels with every pulse of your heart! We immediately sense just a few seconds of interrupted breathing as your oxygen levels drop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><b>Is EverSleep simple to use?</b></span></td>
<td>Very simple! There aren’t even any buttons! Just charge EverSleep for a few hours then unplug it. When you are ready to sleep, just wear EverSleep like a wrist watch, apply the finger sensor with a small piece of medical tape (included), and tap the unit twice! In a few seconds, EverSleep lights up green, and you are ready for bed. In the morning, just take it off. EverSleep knows when you remove it, and stops recording.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><b>My EverSleep shows that I have interrupted breathing that might be Sleep Apnea! Now what?</b></span></td>
<td>The simple answer is to see your doctor, and try some of the self-help coaching tips from the app.  Usually, sleep apnea is caused by an obstructed airway (called “obstructive sleep apnea”) but it is sometimes caused by your brain somehow “forgetting” to breathe during sleep (called “Central Sleep Apnea”). Your doctor may suggest another sleep study in a laboratory, medications, a sleep diary, a special mouthguard or pillow, or even a CPAP machine. Users who suffer from sleep apnea and other disorders can track how treatments, sleep aids, and tips are working for them with EverSleep. Keep your eyes on our website for more information about products and tips for sleep better.  Remember that EverSleep is not a medical device and does not diagnose, treat, or cure any medical conditions. If you think you have a sleep disorder, consult your health care provider for diagnosis and treatment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><b>My EverSleep shows that I may NOT have Sleep Apnea, but I’m still having poor sleep. Now What?</b></span></td>
<td>You may have Onset Insomnia (can’t get to sleep), Maintenance Insomnia (can’t stay asleep), or Early Awakening Insomnia (wake up too early.)  You may have Fragmented sleep which interferes with the deep restful sleep your body needs.  EverSleep can detect these and other sleep-related problems. Again, you should see your doctor about a laboratory sleep study for or other lifestyle changes. However, it is important to note that some people sleep badly only occasionally, and these may be cases of Transient Sleep Apnea, or maybe just a stressful week. This is the power of owning EverSleep! You can test yourself for one night or ten nights, and see how weight changes, alcohol, stress, etc. affect your sleep quality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><b>What about the radio frequency emissions? </b></span></td>
<td>EverSleep uses Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0.  To compare, remember that EverSleep broadcasts only about 20 feet while your cell phone can broadcast for 20 miles! EverSleep doesn't broadcast continuously, so an eight hour night is equivalent to one-half of a second of a cell phone call.</td>

EverSleep identifies these and other problems that interfere with your sleep and then gives you the knowledge to take control and wake up rested. Snoring disrupts those you're sleeping with just as much as it disrupts your own sleep. EverSleep monitors you snoring and determines how and why it's happening. EverSleep then gives you specific coaching actions to tackle your snoring problems. Whether you can't get to sleep, can't stay asleep or you wake up too early, EverSleep analyses your insomnia, and coaches you through it. EverSleep helps measure the effectiveness of your CPAP, and if there's a concern, we'll alert you to talk to your doctor.   Using four lab-quality sensors, EverSleep tracks over 20 different aspects of your sleep.                The free iOS and Android app lets you easily set up and manage your profile, track your data trends, and receive coaching specific to improving your sleep.    What you get with your pre-order   EverSleep takes all the same technology used in sleep labs and shrinks it down into a comfortable and wireless package.EverSleep is the only consumer sleep device that measures blood oxygen, pulse rate, breathing disturbances, awake/sleep movements, snoring, bedtimes, and insomnias. We aggregate 40 complex measurements, and then correlate those against your detailed profile and nightly sleep-related questions. Our coaching engine then analyzes over 5,000 combinations to deliver very detailed coaching specific to your night of sleep. While other devices may show a graph or a month's worth of pulse rate data, EverSleep is like having a coach at your side every morning.  EverSleep was created by a group of experienced engineers, entrepreneurs, and sleep techs. Together they have brought over 25 FDA approved medical devices to market, own 20+ medical device patents, and have decades of experience. Their goal is to make understanding the science behind your sleep easier than ever.    EverSleep is ready for production. Here are our Functional prototypes made with real injection-molded housings and our final circuit boards communicating patient data to a PC via USB for engineering development.  We are able to ship worldwide. We can't ship to the following select countries: Brazil, Chile, China, Ecuador, India, Israel, Peru, Qatar, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, and Turkey.VAT and GST not included. Please see reward details for the shipping cost that applies to you.We plan to ship the product in October 2017*. We will keep you up to date on our progress and the expected delivery date of your order.   *Actual ship dates may vary. International orders subject to CE certification will ship once certification is registered.We will keep you notified of your product ship date.EverSleep may ship to you directly or from Amazon.  The recipient is the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination country. The recipient of orders shipped outside the United States may be subject to significant import taxes, VAT, customs duties, and fees levied by the destination country, which are levied once a shipment reaches the recipient's country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be fulfilled by the recipient; shipper has no control over these charges, nor can shipper predict what they may be.Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for more information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates.By backing now you'll get to own one of the very first EverSleep devices off the line plus exclusive access to provide valuable feedback that will shape future generations of the product. 

What is EverSleep?
EverSleep is the world’s most advanced consumer sleep tracker. We use hospital-grade infra-red oximetry technology to monitor your blood oxygen level 30 times per second while you sleep. We combine this with pulse rate measurement, snore, and movement to generate a complete physiological analysis of your night.


How will EverSleep's Coaching help me sleep better?
EverSleep gathers much more information than other sleep trackers, AND we correlate those measurements with profile and nightly questions that you answer.   For example, did you know that some insomnia is caused by breathing disruption?  If we measure several breathing disruptions in the few minutes before you wake up with middle-of-the-night insomnia, AND you’ve answered “yes” to a question about ""allergies, stuffy nose, or other breathing difficulties"", EverSleep coaches you to try an over-the-counter allergy medication.  Often clearing your sinus will prevent the insomnia!  In another interesting example, did you know that fast pulse rate episodes can “fragment” your sleep, causing you to lose precious “quality” sleep time?  If we measure several fast pulse rate episodes, we can calculate how much quality sleep you’ve “lost” due to those episodes.  Now, if you’ve answered “yes” to the question “I’ve had caffeine after lunch”, we correlate the fast pulse rate episodes to the caffeine consumption.  Maybe you are especially sensitive to caffeine but don’t know it - many people are.  This is why you THINK you slept 8 hours, but really only had a few hours of quality sleep.  Our coaching would be to try a few nights without caffeine, and wear the EverSleep again.  We bet you’ll sleep better!


Why is EverSleep different than other sleep trackers?
Wearable trackers like the FitBit, Apple Watch, Jawbone, Polar, Withings, Beddit, Misfit, etc., can only measure your movement while you sleep - they rate your sleep by how much you move. EverSleep measures your blood oxygen level, pulse rate, snore, AND movement to help you determine WHY you are sleeping badly.  Then it gives detailed COACHING tips to help with your specific problems.


What is Sleep Fragmentation?
People generally sleep in 4 stages.   Stage one is light sleep, typically the first ten minutes of sleeping.  Stage two is about 40 minutes of moderate sleep, your body is getting ready to restore itself!  Stage three is where the serious restorative work happens.  REM sleep usually follows stage 3.   Now, ANY INTERRUPTION in this pattern and you have to “go back” to stage 1 and start over!  This is the problem with sleep apnea, pulse rate “spikes”, involuntary movements, breathing disruptions, insomnias, etc.  They “fragment” your sleep, and cause you to “start over” all night!  This is why you can stay in bed for 8 hours, and you think you’ve been asleep but you didn’t get the QUALITY sleep that you needed.


What is Sleep Apnea?
Sleep Apnea is a condition where the soft tissue in your tongue and throat collapses as your muscles relax during sleep. This restriction in your breathing causes snoring, reduced oxygen levels (hypopnea), or even a complete closure of your airway, literally leaving you choking or gasping for air many times per night. Millions of Americans today have undiagnosed sleep apnea, which left untreated, can lead to chronic inflammation and a slew of other medical problems. Sleep apnea is linked to a number of serious chronic diseases, including: Diabetes, Drug Resistant Hypertension / High Blood Pressure, Heart Attack, Stroke, Congestive Heart Failure, and Obesity


How do I know if I need EverSleep?
Do you Snore? Are you a restless or ""Light"" Sleeper?  Do you have trouble falling or staying asleep?  Are you tired during the day? Does your spouse say you seem to stop breathing during the night?  Do you have sleep apnea?  Do you have a CPAP machine and want to monitor your oxygen levels over time? Are you exercising and eating right, and now want to measure sleep improvements?   If you answered YES to any of the above, EverSleep is for you. EverSleep can do all of this in the palm of your hand because it is the only sleep tracker to measure your oxygen levels continuously during the night, with the added benefit of NO ongoing fees or subscriptions.


You mentioned blood oxygen, does EverSleep use needles or draw your blood?
EverSleep is completely non-invasive, there are no needles or blood, nothing penetrates your skin. It is completely painless. We use highly calibrated red and infra-red LED lights to “look through” your finger with an advanced light sensor, and then calculate your real-time blood oxygen level. It is sensitive enough to see the changes in your oxygen levels with every pulse of your heart! We immediately sense just a few seconds of interrupted breathing as your oxygen levels drop.


Is EverSleep simple to use?
Very simple! There aren’t even any buttons! Just charge EverSleep for a few hours then unplug it. When you are ready to sleep, just wear EverSleep like a wrist watch, apply the finger sensor with a small piece of medical tape (included), and tap the unit twice! In a few seconds, EverSleep lights up green, and you are ready for bed. In the morning, just take it off. EverSleep knows when you remove it, and stops recording.


My EverSleep shows that I have interrupted breathing that might be Sleep Apnea! Now what?
The simple answer is to see your doctor, and try some of the self-help coaching tips from the app.  Usually, sleep apnea is caused by an obstructed airway (called “obstructive sleep apnea”) but it is sometimes caused by your brain somehow “forgetting” to breathe during sleep (called “Central Sleep Apnea”). Your doctor may suggest another sleep study in a laboratory, medications, a sleep diary, a special mouthguard or pillow, or even a CPAP machine. Users who suffer from sleep apnea and other disorders can track how treatments, sleep aids, and tips are working for them with EverSleep. Keep your eyes on our website for more information about products and tips for sleep better.  Remember that EverSleep is not a medical device and does not diagnose, treat, or cure any medical conditions. If you think you have a sleep disorder, consult your health care provider for diagnosis and treatment.


My EverSleep shows that I may NOT have Sleep Apnea, but I’m still having poor sleep. Now What?
You may have Onset Insomnia (can’t get to sleep), Maintenance Insomnia (can’t stay asleep), or Early Awakening Insomnia (wake up too early.)  You may have Fragmented sleep which interferes with the deep restful sleep your body needs.  EverSleep can detect these and other sleep-related problems. Again, you should see your doctor about a laboratory sleep study for or other lifestyle changes. However, it is important to note that some people sleep badly only occasionally, and these may be cases of Transient Sleep Apnea, or maybe just a stressful week. This is the power of owning EverSleep! You can test yourself for one night or ten nights, and see how weight changes, alcohol, stress, etc. affect your sleep quality.


What about the radio frequency emissions? 
EverSleep uses Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0.  To compare, remember that EverSleep broadcasts only about 20 feet while your cell phone can broadcast for 20 miles! EverSleep doesn't broadcast continuously, so an eight hour night is equivalent to one-half of a second of a cell phone call.


Who created EverSleep?
The Founders are two career medical device engineers and one career sleep clinician.  The full team includes several software engineers and two more sleep clinicians. 


Why should we use EverSleep?
The only sleep wearable that measures oxygen, heart rate, snoring, and movement continuously, and coaches you in the morning.  We fill the gap between simplistic fitness bracelets and a full hospital-grade sleep lab overnight study.  Own EverSleep and use it several times per month - coaching and improving your sleep every time!


How much does EverSleep cost?
The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price is $199, but you can get it for much less now during the Indiegogo campaign.  This is a special campaign only price, so hurry!


Where can we buy EverSleep?
EverSleep is an exclusive Indiegogo campaign for now.  Always check www.GetEverSleep.com for more info.


What do we get when we pre-order EverSleep?
In the package you get the EverSleep wrist device with attached finger sensor and a comfortable silicone strap, a USB charging cord, a small roll of medical tape (if the sensor needs a little help staying on over night) and the free app.


Why are you crowdfunding?
We've completed the design of the device and sensor, and we have a working app.  We've built two separate pilot runs of 20 devices with real circuit boards, real production tooling, real cutting dies, and real molded housings.  Now we need the crowdfunding to ""fill the pipeline"" and purchase our first high-volume production parts orders, and purchase a few high-volume production tools   Again, the software, firmware, mechanical, and electrical engineering are done, but now we need to fund the first few thousand units.

Any USB port will charge the EverSleep in just 2 hours. One charge lasts 16 hours of sleep analysis. A USB charging cable is included with EverSleep.


What are the dimensions and weight?
1.13 Oz / 32 Grams.  1.53"" wide x 2.04"" long x 0.46"" thick without strap and sensor


How does EverSleep work?
Using two LEDs and a sensitive photodetector, we can measure your body's oxygen content 30 times per second.  This relates to sleep apneas, snoring, hypopnea, and other sleep related breathing disturbances.  We use this same technology to measure your pulse rate, and an 3-axis solid-state accelerometer to measure micro-motions in your arms as you sleep.


What kind of sensors are you using? 
Very sensitive 3-axis accelerometer, a precision photodetector, and two LEDs with tuned frequency to measure blood oxygen.


Will there be updates to EverSleep in the future?
Software can update over Bluetooth as more features are released.


Is my sleep data safe?
EverSleep never stores your name or other personally identifiable information. You can choose to share your data with your friends, family, or your doctor if you want.


How does EverSleep integrate with other connected devices? 
Bluetooth 4.0 (BTLE) to our free coaching app on your iPhone or Android mobile.


Is EverSleep waterproof?
No, it's not waterproof, but it can easily be wiped with a moist cloth for cleaning.


Where is EverSleep manufactured?
Colorado, United States



Does EverSleep have an app? Which phones does it work with?
Yes - any Android or iPhone with Bluetooth 4.0


When will the app be available?
Available when the unit releases.


Can we also access app functions on a web browser? 
Some of the learning, general coaching, and how-to features are available on the www.GetEverSleep.com, but we don't transmit personally identifiable data to the server, so we can't provide any of your personal information on the browser.


How does the device connect to the app?
Bluetooth 4.0 low energy (BLTE)


What can we expect from the app?
Beautiful full-featured app that lets you measure your sleep, receive coaching in the morning, and review sleep trends.


Will there be updates available through the app?
Yes 



How do I set up EverSleep?
Just put it on your wrist like a watch.  The finger sensor attaches with a small piece of medical tape (supplied).


How do I turn EverSleep on and off?
Just ""double tap"" directly on the unit to power on!  Just take if off and EverSleep will automatically power down. 


How do I control EverSleep?
There are no controls, no user interface. Simply power it on and data will be collected via the app.


What is the care and cleaning of it?
Just a simple wipe with a moist cloth or alcohol based cleaner will be fine, if needed.


Is it dishwasher safe / machine washable?
No - it is not for the dishwasher or clothes washer.


Does it have an expiry date?
No expiration.  You own it forever, with no subscription.



What are the recommend ages?
EverSleep is recommended for ages from 10-100.


Where can I use EverSleep?
Any time you go to sleep!  It is great on travel, vacation, or other times you do not sleep in your own bed.


Is EverSleep safe?
Yes!  It is just as safe as wearing a wrist watch and a finger bandage to bed.  The Bluetooth communication from EverSleep to the app is not continuous and is equivalent to making a 1.2 second phone call!


What certifications does EverSleep have?
FCC clearance on the Bluetooth radio module. U.S. Patents Pending


How durable is EverSleep?
Very durable!  The housing is made from a combination of motorcycle helmet and bulletproof glass.  The sensor is designed to flex not break.


How is my privacy protected?
We never transmit personally identifiable information to our servers.


How secure is EverSleep?
BTLE is a very secure protocol with embedded encryption.  Also, the data sent between the device and your phone is obfuscated such that nobody could read or understand the information.


Can someone watch or listen to me?
No, our device does not use the video camera.  The application uses the microphone on your mobile device to measure snoring, but no sounds are ""recorded"" (for instance in a playable ""sound file"").  We only measure whether or not you are snoring.


Are there any risks associated with use?
No more risk than wearing a wrist watch at night with a small bandage on your finger.


Is EverSleep an FDA 510(k) cleared device?
No, but the design team has spent their entire careers designing hospital-grade pulse oximeters and other medical devices. Our team has released over 40+ medical devices and holds over 25 patents. We’ve designed the EverSleep with the same technology and care as our other devices. We hope that a professional version of the device will have full FDA clearance in early 2018. Until then, we make no claim that EverSleep can treat, cure, or diagnose any disease.  If you think a medical condition may be impacting your sleep, consult your health care provider for diagnosis and treatment.

 

When does shipping begin?
October 2017.


Where does it ship?
US and internationally. The purchaser pays for any international shipping, import duties, taxes, and overheads.


How much is shipping?
Free in the US.  International orders pay shipping, import duties, taxes, and overheads.


I'm interested in a distribution partnership.
Please contact us at info@GetEverSleep.com


Do I have to pay VAT / GST?
EverSleep ships to you directly from Amazon.  The recipient is the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination country. The recipient of orders shipped outside the United States may be subject to significant import taxes, VAT, customs duties, and fees levied by the destination country, which are levied once a shipment reaches the recipient's country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be fulfilled by the recipient; Amazon has no control over these charges, nor can Amazon predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for more information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates.


What are the risks & challenges of getting the device today?
Very Few!!! The design is done, the injection molds are done, the electronics are completed, the firmware is completed.  All functions have been tested and the unit  has been worn for 40+ patient nights already.  The unit communicates with the app on our smartphone via bluetooth.  The crowdfunding will help fund high-volume production tooling and fixtures, but two of the founders are very experienced in high-volume medical device manufacturing.

 

Is there a warranty?
30 day warranty against defects in manufacturing or materials.


What is your refund policy?
Refunds are processed on a case-by-case basis; at some point we will need to lock refunds in order to go into production & shipment. We will not be able to refund orders once they've shipped. 


What is your return / exchange policy?
If you received your product and you aren't satisfied, you may exchange it for a new one within 30 days, less shipping & handling fees.


How do I upgrade my pre-order to a better one?
There is no need - we are shipping the full featured device to all customers.


How do I choose more than one reward? 
We offer multi-pack options. 


How can I check the status of my pre-order?
Check the Indiegogo Blog, we'll be posting very frequent updates as get get closer to production.


I'm interested in becoming a Beta Tester. 
Please contact us, we a specifically looking for clinicians or people already using CPAP.  info@GetEverSleep.com


Why do I have to wait longer than usual?
This is not just pre-orders: You're helping to build the device, and we need to know how many to make before we can start production. This is the first of its kind, and you'll be glad you waited. We will send you updates while we work to produce the first batch.

Digitally mastered hypnosis and meditation audios - to support your training and help you relaxSo it works out perfectly.Back our campaign and spend 10 minutes in the evenings educating yourself!Then, when your Claridream PRO drops in through in the mail - you'll be 100% ready to experience mind-blowingly colorful lucid dreams.That’s why Claridream PRO is more than just a supplement, it’s the world’s only complete dream control system.We are The World of Lucid Dreaming.The web’s fullest, most trusted and evidence-based web community on the subject of lucid dreaming.Founded in 2008, we receive over 4 million visitors every year, have 275,000 Facebook fans and an active community forum of 4,000 regular members and 30,000 email subscribers.We have over 300 free articles on the learnable skill of lucid dreaming.And each and every one is based on scientific evidence and peer reviewed studies.When we looked around the dreaming supplement industry, we didn't like what we saw!Everything seemed to be in two camps.On the one hand, there were a small number of sexy brands - but they were using ingredients in paltry amounts. To be honest, we never felt any effects from them.On the other hand, there were a few brands of generic supplements. These delivered results, but MISSED OUT on potential synergies with other dream herbs.These synergies were only available to those that were willing to order several separate supplements - and willing to spend hours online reading conflicting reports of what worked and what didn't!We thought we could improve the situation.So we set out with a single mind to create the BEST dream enhancement supplement on the market. Period.Our core principal - we WOULD NOT SKIMP on dosage to reduce cost.So in January 2016 we set out to research and develop a dream enhancement formula that was second to none.First Claridream PRO formula mockup - July 2016Claridream PRO is based on countless hours of researching different dream herbs, what works and what doesn't.The result is a strong, no-gimmicks product based on 40mg Huperzine-A powder, 140mg valerian root and 34mg passion flower.Oh - and 260mg chamomile extract as well. This we include for its sleep and relaxation benefits. You see, we found people were getting too excited at the prospect of vivid dreams - and needed something to help them relax and drift off :)And like everything we do, it's backed by solid science. Both valerian root and passion flower act on GABA receptors. Now GABA and Acetylcholine are released at the same time in the brain. And this is what makes Claridream PRO such an effective product.Because we haven't skimped, our cost base is higher than any of the other products out there.If you were to buy these 5 supplements individually, it would cost you over $70 (and that's not including postage!)But, this is the absolute best blend you can get for dream enhancement - and it actually works.We don't hide behind a Proprietary Blend either.Our label is 100% transparent, so you can see exactly what you are getting.Why do we need your help?Some of the ingredients in Claridream PRO are expensive and hard to find. Contract manufacturers with the right experience are few and far between.The high minimum order quantities needed to produce this supplement are beyond our reach.We have our formula finalized and well tested. FDA compliant labeling and packaging has been approved. And we have great contract manufacturing and fulfillment partners selected.We know Claridream PRO works and we want to bring reliable dream enhancement to the wider world.To put Claridream PRO into full scale production, in an FDA approved, GMP certified production facility, we need $50,000.Back us today and help make this dream a reality.How many times a week can I take Claridream PRO?Our product is strong and due to the intense nature of the experience, we recommend taking Claridream PRO no more than once a week.Are there any side effects?As with any product, there are always some known side effects that can occur in a small number of cases or a rare allergic reaction. Most people will not experience any of these side effects. Minor stomach cramps or muscle twitches are occasionally reported.Are there any contraindications?Don't take Claridream PRO if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Also, if you are already taking any prescription medications or antidepressants then we recommend playing safe and avoiding Claridream PRO for now.How will I get my FREE access to Lucid Dreaming Fast TrackWhen you back our campaign, Indiegogo send us a note of your email address. As this is a one-time campaign, there is no automated process to create your account. So we will create your account and email you with login details. This will be a top priority for us! It could be upto a few hours before you get your details. But please bear with us and keep in mind we also need a little time to eat, sleep, breath etc :)Surely there's a disclaimer?Yup, here we go.These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.

Pain is a whisper, vibration is yelling.  Cold and too much pressure are slow nerves - they start out quiet but then get bigger signal the longer they’re triggered. Pain nerves also run along with cold nerves, which is why an ice pack numbs up the skin over time when you have an injury.  Motion and cold and pain are all trying to fit through the same “gate” in the back of your spine, fighting to send a signal to the brain. If you use strong enough cold and motion, they squeeze through but pain can’t get through the gate, hence “Gate Control,"" or as we call it “Cool-Pulse.""</p><p style=""color: #3b4843;font-family:trebuchet MS;""><strong>Is there any research on DuoTherm?</strong> We’ve been collecting information on the DuoTherm prototypes, but since we aren't in production yet there are no studies directly on DuoTherm. There are LOTS of studies on the things that make it work, though.  Hot, cold, low-frequency vibration, and acupressure have been found effective for back pain. Pain Care Labs’ patented devices are the only ones on the market with ultra high frequency vibration; our high vibration frequency has been proven effective in two studies for sharp pain.  Pain Care Labs is the first to combine thermal and vibration- there are 23 studies on our Cool-Pulse Buzzy device for sharp pain.</p><p style=""color: #3b4843;font-family:trebuchet MS;""><strong>Why crowdfunding? </strong></p><p>We often get questions about why we chose to raise money to develop DuoTherm on a crowdfunding platform, and particularly why Indiegogo. People have suggested that we go on Shark Tank again. Others ask why we don't use venture capitalists or banks.</p><p>Crowdfunding gives us direct access to the very people who want to see our pain relief concept become a product. Unlike more traditional funding sources, the “crowd” reacts very quickly and passionately. Often people with pain suffer quietly - even since starting the campaign, we have learned lessons about pain relief we wouldn't know if we just made what we THINK people want. And we've changed the product because of that feedback.</p><p>Many people recognize that while a contribution to a campaign is a big risk, they are willing to trust to contribute to making something important, and because when the product becomes a reality it will benefit them directly.</p><p><br/>Thank you for taking a risk on DuoTherm.

The best judge of what makes you feel better is YOU.Promotes blood flow and stimulates acute and sharp pain blocking nerves through ""Gate Control""Decreases spasm and reduces chronic strain pain locally with TENS-comparable frequenciesRelaxes tense and spasming muscles, promotes blood flow, replaces pain with comfortReduces inflammation and swelling, blocks pain with gate control and pain relieving feedback loopRelaxes spasmed muscles by focusing massage on myofascial trigger pointsScience shows that the more control we have over something, the less we perceive pain. DuoTherm puts the power of pain control in your hands.DuoTherm is the ONLY device to combinehigh-frequency vibration with ice or heat for immediate pain relief.Whether your pain is from sitting in an office, standing in a hospital or restaurant, driving for a living, or from lifting or injury, DuoTherm provides portable, powerful pain relief.End Unnecessary Pain“This mission may sound simple, but pain relief is complicated. The most important thing I’ve learned from 20 years as a pediatrician and pain researcher is that pain is personal. No one can tell you what works best for YOU - and trying options over time gives power over pain.” - Amy Baxter MDIt started in 2004, when emergency pediatrician and pain relief lecturer Amy Baxter invented a device for kids’ shots. She got an NIH grant to prove it worked, and in 2009 her vibrating ice device “Buzzy” was introduced to block needle pain. To date, pain from over 31 million needle procedures has been blocked with award-winning Buzzy, for kids and adults.When the opioid crisis hit,the Pain Care Labs team applied the patented Buzzy Cool-Pulse™ technology to extremities with a new product --VibraCool. VibraCool provided a drug-free option for people suffering from tendinits, plantar fasciitis, and other chronic pain. But the Pain Care Labs kept getting the same question over again: ""When are you making one for the back?""After prototyping, researching, and listening to what customers wanted in a low-back device, DuoTherm was born.  The new DuoTherm uses six different scientifically proven pain relief methods. There are options for soothing or intense vibration, cold or heat, general pressure or concentrated acupressure. There’s only one way to know what works best for YOU. Put it on. Pain Care Labs (formerly known as MMJ Labs) has been featured in the following publications:and has received awards from the following institutions:Our TeamHear What Our Beta Testers Are SayingJennifer M. - Heavy Lifter“I Love it!  It feels like a massage chair, but more targeted and intense. So customizable - l like having variety of options.  And it’s easy!” LaRhonda J.- Fitness Enthusiast“I LOVE that I have the ability to choose based on how I’m feeling that day.”Paul B.  - 10 Hour Office Days“True test was that I stood for 15-20 minutes with it on. My back didn't tense up and didn't hurt like it normally does...Really like better than TENS. This is not unpleasant. You have a similar if not better effect than TENS, without the jolts & twitching."" Traci P. - Multiple Back Surgeries“I’ve tried vibration and heat and cold.  This is the only thing I’ve ever tried that lets me do all of them with one device. I usually have to buy two or three products, I love that this is just one.”U.S. Pain Foundation - U.S. Pain foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to serving those who live with pain conditions and their care providers. The mission of U.S. Pain Foundation is to empower, educate, connect, and advocate for people living with chronic conditions that cause pain.  Your donation will help them directly provide assistance to their Pain Warriors of all ages and backgrounds, from everyday heroes, to Veterans, to children.

ATI Foundation supports ATI Physical Therapy’s outreach program to underserved communities, globally. Many in these communities have limited mobility due to their pain. Your donation will give hope back and enable these patients to treat the pain rather than just accept it as well as allow them to more easily perform daily tasks that pain often limits them in doing. Learn more at https://www.atipt.com/ati-foundation. What is Gate Control Pain Relief?  Cold and vibration work through physiology called “Gate Control."" The small fast pain nerves run alongside huge fast motion nerves that can block out pain, like when you bump your elbow and rub it to keep it from hurting. Pain is a whisper, vibration is yelling.  Cold and too much pressure are slow nerves - they start out quiet but then get bigger signal the longer they’re triggered. Pain nerves also run along with cold nerves, which is why an ice pack numbs up the skin over time when you have an injury.  Motion and cold and pain are all trying to fit through the same “gate” in the back of your spine, fighting to send a signal to the brain. If you use strong enough cold and motion, they squeeze through but pain can’t get through the gate, hence “Gate Control,"" or as we call it “Cool-Pulse.""Is there any research on DuoTherm? We’ve been collecting information on the DuoTherm prototypes, but since we aren't in production yet there are no studies directly on DuoTherm. There are LOTS of studies on the things that make it work, though.  Hot, cold, low-frequency vibration, and acupressure have been found effective for back pain. Pain Care Labs’ patented devices are the only ones on the market with ultra high frequency vibration; our high vibration frequency has been proven effective in two studies for sharp pain.  Pain Care Labs is the first to combine thermal and vibration- there are 23 studies on our Cool-Pulse Buzzy device for sharp pain.Why crowdfunding? We often get questions about why we chose to raise money to develop DuoTherm on a crowdfunding platform, and particularly why Indiegogo. People have suggested that we go on Shark Tank again. Others ask why we don't use venture capitalists or banks.Crowdfunding gives us direct access to the very people who want to see our pain relief concept become a product. Unlike more traditional funding sources, the “crowd” reacts very quickly and passionately. Often people with pain suffer quietly - even since starting the campaign, we have learned lessons about pain relief we wouldn't know if we just made what we THINK people want. And we've changed the product because of that feedback.Many people recognize that while a contribution to a campaign is a big risk, they are willing to trust to contribute to making something important, and because when the product becomes a reality it will benefit them directly.Thank you for taking a risk on DuoTherm.

Any additional funding will be used in the development of evolutionary innovative new product lines to come in the near future! When do I get my socks?Our manufacturing partners are standing by and excited to start producing GEEL SOCKS at full capacity. As soon as our campaign ends, they will get to work. Allowing 20 days to receive the funds we raised we can expect to have GEEL SOCKS ON YOUR FEET within 3 months after the end of the campaign. And we will do everything within our control to expedite the process to get them to you as soon as possible. How do I wash them?GEEL SOCKS wash and wear like a regular sock. We wanted to make sure we created a sock that you could wear every day without worrying about any special washing instructions. GEEL SOCKS will hold up to the high heat of any dryer and come out ready to wear every time. What if I don't like them?Unlikely, however, stranger things have happened. That said, we stand by our product 100% so if for any reason you aren't happy with your GEEL SOCKS just contact us at info@boo-g.ca and we'll arrange for an exchange or refund. Can I wear my GEEL SOCKS outside the gym?Absolutely! You can wear them wherever you like. While GEEL SOCKS were designed and engineered for the elite athlete, they have evolved into the best, most comfortable, most practical comfort and protective sock for anyone and everyone seeking comfort and relief from general foot and heel pain, ankle, knee and back pain. What do I do if I don't want to take them off because they're so comfy?Well, the only answer to that question is make sure to have enough GEEL SOCKS on hand to always be able to put on a fresh pair. We recommend at least one pair a day, plus an additional pair for every time you exercise throughout the week. What do I do if people try to steal my socks?Not surprising. We've seen it happen. Roommate, significant other, even kids will all look for the opportunity to steal your GEEL SOCKS. The only solution here is to make sure these people have their own. GEEL SOCKS make for excellent gifts and give back at the same time. What's this whole ""be boo-g"" thing about?When we say “be boo-g”, we mean it as a way of approaching every day. It's a reminder to push yourself harder. To be bolder. To be better. To be different. To never give up. Eliminate excuses and rise above all. A reminder that you are somebody that can achieve greatness. And a reminder that we we're all created and are all someone’s children. ""be boo-g"" What is boo-g cares?While boo-g was created by the passion, Richard and Irma intend to form (boo-g cares) a not for profit organization for the passion, which will provide youth with Academic, Athletic and Skills Training opportunities they wold not otherwise attain on their own.  A proceed from each sale of every boo-g product sold going will go towards funding boo-g cares in the future. We believe the youth are our future, and providing them with positive opportunities today leads to a brighter, more productive, safer tomorrow.",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As we continue to expand our lifespans, we need to spend more time thinking about what we are doing to improve the quality of our lives over longer periods of time. It is no longer sufficient to keep people breathing: we need to keep them exercising. According to one study, just 1 in 8 people will be totally fit throughout their lifetime on Earth by 2040. 1 in 8. That number is outrageously low, and if we want to do any better in the long term, it is going to take a whole lot of work.</p>
<p>Bringing together more than 100 years of research, I am introducing a new fitness device that uses the power of frequencies in order to help any adult reach peak performance and become totally fit for longer periods of time. This portable device runs of a 9-volt battery, uses 10 different frequencies (including the love frequency), and features LED lights for information, two copper grips, a tech sheet, and an easy-to-follow guide. If you are ready to take control of your fitness, this is the device for you. It’s like walking around with a personal trainer in your hands all day!<br/> </p>

As a thank-you, we are offering our device at a huge discount off the MSRP exclusively through this crowdfunding campaign, just as our way of saying “thanks.” Note: Take a look at the ""Perks"".</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>ABOUT</strong></h2>
<p>My personal fitness journey started during my time in service (thanks to my NCO/Sgt). I was someone who carried this sentiment: <i>I could eat anything and not gain weight</i>. I later learned that the correct statement was:<i> I only ate when I felt like it, sometimes a lot, sometimes a little</i>. I later learned how much <i>my body </i>actually needed and how important it is not to go over or under.</p>

He took me to the gym for 2 weeks to guide me on equipment usage and form, then left me on my way. Three years later and three years ago, I was still going to the gym weekly. At this moment, I was planning on what my next career move was. I thought about becoming a personal trainer and I studied the books, but it wasn't enough... I wanted to impact more people (<i>and my training method was akin to my time in the Corps, so I didn't want to yell at any poor soul just trying to learn</i>). I thought about the <u>word document</u> and how I could utilize that format. I started sharing work out plans and anyone that asked, I created one for them. <i>That wasn't enough, either. </i><br/><br/>Each person and each individual live with different work schedules and how they utilize their leisure. Creating plans after plan, doesn't teach them how to ""adapt &amp; overcome"" or adjust accordingly. <strong>I had to think back of why I didn't start lifting in the first place and what challenges I met inside the gym</strong>. <i>I just wanted a simple plan. What is a triceps press? How do I do it? Why am I doing it on this day, with this muscle? How do I use this machine? What are my movements? What are some tips, things I should be aware of? These are a lot of questions.. how do I consolidate it? Creating a pattern? </i><br/><br/>After three years, it turned into a journal with 100+ exercises with their own log section, pages to pull out and reinsert for customization (into 3-day plans to 6-day plans for example), tracking progress, and something to reuse over and over. </p>

I set to raise funds early among family & friends and covered 15% of my goal, so that I have a smaller goal when setting up this campaign. 
I set the campaign to flexible funding, because I will still be actively crowdfunding it in person in my home-town. 
All of the funding will be for the production of the journal, packaging, & shipping. 

 
 
ABOUT
My personal fitness journey started during my time in service (thanks to my NCO/Sgt). I was someone who carried this sentiment: I could eat anything and not gain weight. I later learned that the correct statement was: I only ate when I felt like it, sometimes a lot, sometimes a little. I later learned how much my body actually needed and how important it is not to go over or under.
A simple gesture; he provided me with a word document and in that document a basic fitness plan. He took me to the gym for 2 weeks to guide me on equipment usage and form, then left me on my way. Three years later and three years ago, I was still going to the gym weekly. At this moment, I was planning on what my next career move was. I thought about becoming a personal trainer and I studied the books, but it wasn't enough... I wanted to impact more people (and my training method was akin to my time in the Corps, so I didn't want to yell at any poor soul just trying to learn). I thought about the word document and how I could utilize that format. I started sharing work out plans and anyone that asked, I created one for them. That wasn't enough, either. Each person and each individual live with different work schedules and how they utilize their leisure. Creating plans after plan, doesn't teach them how to ""adapt & overcome"" or adjust accordingly. I had to think back of why I didn't start lifting in the first place and what challenges I met inside the gym. I just wanted a simple plan. What is a triceps press? How do I do it? Why am I doing it on this day, with this muscle? How do I use this machine? What are my movements? What are some tips, things I should be aware of? These are a lot of questions.. how do I consolidate it? Creating a pattern? After three years, it turned into a journal with 100+ exercises with their own log section, pages to pull out and reinsert for customization (into 3-day plans to 6-day plans for example), tracking progress, and something to reuse over and over. 
 

 
RISKS & CHALLENGES
The risk and challenge is making it affordable, as seen in the image above of the fitness journal comparisons. The main goal is to provide something that someone like before-gym-me would benefit and current-gym-me would benefit from. Figuring out which methods are cost-effective, yet keeping the product of quality. With that said, I hope you agree and enjoy what I created, most of all that it benefits you. 
 

 
PURPOSE & GOALS
The purpose of this journal is to become the starting point or gateway into health & fitness. The journal is meant to help build a foundation and with that foundation established, for the user to build off on top of it. There are a numerous amount of fitness mediums to explore: bodybuilding, power-lifting, runners, obstacle course enthusiast, and so forth. The step to getting there is starting, the step to starting is here. The goal? The goal is to make health & fitness easier to attain.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Drugshoppe’s mission is a future of better medicines through low-cost R&amp;D</strong></p>
<p>Today, the cost of medical R&amp;D is at an all time high. Although scientists continue to make amazing progress researching new treatments, too often these new medicines are too expensive for patients to afford. A common refrain from the industry is the high cost of drug innovation. </p>
<p>At Drugshoppe, researchers from Yale and Rice worked tirelessly to develop a new approach combining chemical and biological studies with cutting-edge predictive modeling and data analytics approaches.  Independently validated studies have proven that our technology can outperform big institutions – producing the same or better drug development results at 10-100X lower cost. It's simple math - if we lower the cost drug R&amp;D, we can lower the cost of medicine. </p>
<p>More and more, pharma companies are taking advantage of the climate of rising costs to justify price gouging. We understand that making medicine is about more than just money - this is why we’re pledging 10% of our profits from this drug to <a href=""http://ptsdusa.org/camp-hope/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Camp Hope</a>, a Houston program focused on mental health for returning veterans.</p>

With your help, we will be able to interview top healthcare experts, script + film high-quality 4k videos, and create toolkits filled with key tips + tricks on the topics that matter most to you, all on a sleek, easy-to-access web + app platform.
 
We will also be creating content in multiple languages. We want to make health care as simple as possible for everyone as we create content that can have global positive impact!
 
Check out this sample video from our free YouTube video library that was a gift to us from FocusTV in Los Angeles to kickstart our idea: 

By contributing to us today, you will help create a tech platform filled with curated videos that truly help people. Every dollar counts and we are SO thankful for every contribution we receive! Even if we don't achieve our goal of $71,500, we will use all the funds we receive to create the first videos for The Health Cube to start creating positive impact across the U.S. and beyond. Thank you so much in advance for your contribution to the cause!
WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU!
When you send in a contribution be sure to add a comment voting on which topics matter most to you! Have any crazy stories about navigating health care? Please comment + share!
PLEASE SHARE!
Please share this link with your friends, family, and colleagues and share the link across your social media! All support is incredibly appreciated!! xoxo 
NOW IS THE TIME!
We’ve worked in health care for years and have consistently seen it firsthand. Patients don't know how to navigate the healthcare system and they end up more sick with huge medical bills that otherwise could have been avoided.

<h3>Buddy - The Family Health Monitor Smartwatch with Body Temperature, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate and Health Alerts/Notifications for Children, Adults and Elderly</h3>
<p>Because disease and health issues can strike at any time, we have designed a smartwatch that lets you monitor your children's and/or family’s vital statistics 24 hours a day 7 days a week. This innovative smartwatch checks temperature, blood pressure and heart rate <strong>all day, every day</strong> and is also ideal for <strong>""at risk""</strong> groups.</p>
<p>With any unnatural increases in these statistics the smartwatch will automatically send you an alert/notification directly to your phone with GPS location. Whether it's your child playing in the garden or an elderly relative that lives far away, you will know instantly if any of their vital statistics are outside of acceptable medical range.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>For Children, Adults &amp; Seniors</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Instant Medical Alerts</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>24 hr Temperature monitoring</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>24 hr Blood pressure monitoring</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>24 hr Heart rate monitoring</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>24 hr GPS tracking, for location</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Waterproof</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>A Fully Functional Fitness Watch</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Keep Your Kids and Your Family Safe Plus, Know Exactly Where They Are!</strong></p>
<p>In these worrying and dangerous times it is important to know when family and loved ones have a<strong> fever, high blood pressure or elevated heart rate</strong> as these are major indicators in everyone's <strong>medical health.</strong> </p>
<p>In conjunction with medical doctors and advanced computer programmers we have developed a unique and innovative Smartwatch that notifies you if your children, elderly relatives and/or loved ones become ill. Plus, we have also included a gsm sim card function to track the wearer, so you will know exactly where they are, giving you advanced early warning, wherever they are!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587986179/ipk4arob2msqtfagekks.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<p>For every degree the body's internal temperature rises, the heart beats about 10 beats per minute faster. But an increasing heart rate does not always cause your blood pressure to increase at the same rate. Even though your heart is beating more times per minute, healthy blood vessels dilate (get larger) to allow more blood to flow through more easily. The Family Doctor Smartwatch uses the latest technology plus a <strong>unique intelligent algorithm</strong> that analyzes a combination of different body functions to ascertain the overall health of the user with <strong>alerts </strong>directly to your phone. From the minute you first wear the smartwatch your health history will start to collate your medical statics. This unique software will then compare your data is within acceptable medical ranges. When it is outside of these parameters an alert will be sent and the watch will indicate that there is a health problem. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587985787/hqouph7bdm9plzfjmhlb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p>Initially this was designed to inform us of our children’s location plus monitor body temperature and other vital statistics. So if your child was say, at friends or grandparents you will know exactly where they are and will be notified directly if their temperature or if other vitals start to change. This will allow you to contact and immediately go to their aid. It will even work if they are sleeping in bed at night. </p>
<p>Once the wearers <strong>temperature </strong>starts increasing the watch will monitor and record temperature levels and once they are outside safe parameters our Family Doctor App <strong>will alert you</strong> to the problem, saving valuable time. This rapid action will save the user needless suffering by helping to reduce the fever, and/or administering medication earlier and quicker. There is even an <strong>emergency call button</strong> on the app that is linked directly to your phone.</p>
<p>Since the Covid-19 outbreak we also turned our attention to those most at risk from this dreadful disease, the elderly. Loads of our older generation spend lots of time alone and ailments can often go unnoticed or unattended for long periods of time. Our smart technology watch will help to combat this...for seniors, kids and adults. </p>

<p>Now we are at the stage where we have a working prototype that is not the final design and waiting for the first sample batches of the final design to be delivered. Every person involved in this project are parents and just like you, we all worry about our children, parents and loved ones.

<p><strong>UK &amp; Ukraine Joint Venture </strong></p>
<p>This is a joint UK &amp; Ukrainian venture which utilizes expert Ukrainian Programmers, UK Designers and Medical Advisers from all over the world. We are currently examining manufacturing these smartwatches in both the UK, Ukraine and possibly the USA.</p>
<p><strong>Funds</strong></p>
<p>The adult version is already complete and we are awaiting delivery of final production samples. Funds raised will be used to add additional functions and to manufacture a watch mold for the children's watch sizes which need to be smaller so as not to affect the sensitivity of the sensor contact. Kids watches also need a slightly different watch strap to ensure a good fit.</p>
<p>Although the Smart algorithm is ready, funds will also be spent improving the app display as our original version will be brought up-to-date. If sufficient funds are raised we also plan to add a phone call function to allow you to speak directly to the wearer plus the addition of fitness band functions for the adult watches. We are also wanting to design a system whereby the watch will flash repeatedly when there is a problem thereby alerting the user and people within close proximity.  </p>
