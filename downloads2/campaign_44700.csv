First, for obtaining the diversity of the species and second, for supporting the main industrial sector—fishing! Moreover, mangroves are not only a breeding place for a plethora of aquatic animals but also a natural castle for birds, monkeys and turtles. Because of this stable root system mangrove trees are protecting the land and coastlines from strong waves and floods.​Tyvek® is the favourite material of our company. To this day, we stick with it for all of our products due to its variety of superpowers:Tyvek® is a great alternative for all the animal lovers out there — unlike real leather, there are no animals harmed in its production. We believe that every living being should be treated with respect, thus we support animal rights and have committed ourselves to producing cruelty free products.Tyvek® is a material as equally robust as leather. For instance, it's also used for the stabilisation of avalanche slopes. At the same time, it is light and feels just like paper. But no need to worry, in contrast to paper, Tyvek® is water repellent and will keep your feet dry at all times.Tyvek® is produced in Luxembourg, so we only have a very little CO2 footprint in comparison to fabrics imported from far away like Asia. It is 100% recyclable, leaving endless possibilities for recreating new products while preserving our planet and its resources.The synthetic leather we chose for our toe cap is supplied by a small factory in Italy that has dedicated itself to producing completely vegan materials. It is also approved by PETA.The material is made out of Bio Polyols, which are elements derived from plant materials that could not be used for food farms or animal feed. It contains more than 50% of organic content coming from renewable sources.But of course, the focus on sustainability does not end there, the facilities are fully powered by photovoltaic generators. This supports our vision to set a positive example and produce our products using environmentally friendly methods.The increasing pollution of our oceans is a topic that can no longer be ignored. 70% of the oxygen we breathe is produced by the oceans. Therefore we must not underestimate their impact on our lives. At Paprcuts, we aim to set a positive example in mainstream fashion world by using recycled polyester for our shoe’s outside mesh. Plastic waste, such as PET bottles or abandoned fishing nets, is collected by local fishermen in the Mediterranean Sea and then is up-cycled into yarn by our supplier located in Alicante, Spain.The final mesh is a combination of this yarn and 100% GOTS (GLOBAL ORGANIC TEXTILE STANDARD) certified organic cotton. The certification grants, fair working conditions for all people involved in the material's supply chain and ecological responsibilities, such as a low CO2 footprint, organic production systems maintaining soil fertility, and banning toxic and persistent pesticides are well taken care of.Given our focus on saving the environment, we chose a natural over petroleum-containing synthetic rubber for the sole of our shoes. Caoutchouc is a renewable resource which is cultivated and harvested sustainably. That being said, natural rubber is also biodegradable and can therefore be easily recycled. Moreover, the energy consumption for its production is only around 10% than that of synthetic rubber.Due to its high elasticity, natural rubber adapts itself to your foot. This prevents both pressure points and pain even after long wear. Natural rubber is characterized by its outstanding durability, since the material bounces back into its original shape once the weight is lifted off. This guarantees great comfort in everyday life as well as during activities involving a lot of standing and walking such as city trips or concerts!Soft, lightweight and breathable — these are the most important factors when talking about the inner fabric of a shoe. This is why we decided to use the Coolmax® system.Coolmax® is a fabric is known for its optimal moisture removal and exceptionally good breathability. The surface of Coolmax's fibres is up to 25% larger compared to regular polyester. Therefore, moisture is transported to the outside fast where it evaporates, allowing the fabric to dry extremely quickly.You might be surprised to know that conventional cotton accounts for nearly 25% of the insecticides and 10% of the pesticides used throughout the world.In contrast, organic cotton is produced without using any chemical fertilisers, pesticides or insecticides. Organic cotton is not only beneficial for the environment but is also a lot safer in regards to the health and wellbeing of the farmers and other contributors involved throughout our supply chain.Our inside footbed is produced from cork. Cork trees are naturally found in the Mediterranean region close to our production site in Portugal.Cork is an environmentally friendly all-rounder: It is a buoyant, elastic, and fire and water resistant material. Additionally, the focus on sustainability, recyclability and highest comfortability make cork an indispensable component for us. Paprcuts is made up of 40 exceptionally talented, international team members hailing from different parts of the globe. This diversity is the groundwork of our creativity. The company was founded by Nils in 2011, when he wanted to start his own project.Since 2012, Paprcuts has completed two crowdfunding campaigns because we believe that a crowd is always stronger than a single person. Our first crowdfunding- ""The Thinnest wallet of all Times"", was an amazing experience, we were trusted by over 800 backers and got 180% more funding than our fixed goal of 12,000. Aaaaand - are you still using your wallet? In 2017 we had a great vision of producing Paprcuts Watches. 2075 backers helped us to reach a whopping 106.271 Euro in just one month. This meant we were able to realize this project and develop a watch which actually looks like a simple wristband. Since then our watches have been one of our bestsellers — produced in the heart of Berlin. Our team has been growing really fast since the last two years — we have an in-house creative, marketing, support team and our own production facility in Berlin. The most important thing we have is a team that believes in the same values. We believe in producing regionally with higher standards - creating colorful and practical things. We never stand still and are always thinking of taking a new step towards a conscious lifestyle.",49.0,0,"2 Campaigns

This goal is at the heart of what Pulchritude is about.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY HUMAN TRAFFICKING:</strong></p>
<p>As a mother of two daughters and a high school teacher who works with young people everyday, I was stunned to discover that more than a million kids and young women are trafficked every year. This is a SERIOUS problem. I learned of various organizations who rescue victims, but knew little of what kind of support is provided once these individuals are set free. What Pulchritude will do is provide support and resources for rescued victims ranging from counseling, school supplies, hygiene products, clothing, housing, and food.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>My name is Nic Tharpa Cartier. I have been henna artist, jewelry maker, and clothing and textile designer for many years. It is my goal in life to be able to support myself and make a living doing this exciting creative work. </p>
<p>Recently, through a series of lucky coincidences, I was able to visit Marrakech, Morocco, somewhere I had dreamed of going for some time. It was a trip that would change my life forever.</p>
<p>On my trip, I taught several Moroccan women the art of henna. For women in Morocco, jobs are hard to find, and henna is one traditionally respected job for a woman to have. After taking my classes which were offered for free, my students expressed moving and heartfelt gratitude for the opportunity to learn this skill that they can use to provide for their families. Then and there I vowed that I would return to Morocco so that I could continue this work.</p>
<p>But, traveling to Morocco is not cheap, and in order to return to Marrakech to work with my students, I need to come up with a source of funding. Luckily, I realized that I could use my own artistic passion to give myself the means to continue this amazing project. I had found a place where I could pursue my dreams as an artist, and I could help people in the process. </p>
<p><strong>Here's how it works:</strong> My goal with this fundraiser is to raise seed money that I can use to launch a line of jewelry, all made in good working conditions for a living wage by local Moroccan craftspeople. Profits from the sales of those items will create the funding I need to continue running henna classes. I want to be able to run these classes for many years into the future, so creating this small business will provide an ongoing source of funding. </p>
<p>Additionally, I'll be working with local artists and craftspeople on the execution of designs for my company, which will help keep the community of traditional artisans thriving. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To pursue this project, I need a few different things. First, I need to travel to Marrakech and spend some real time there. This part includes basics like airfare, lodging, and food.</p>
<p>Next, I need seed money to cover the expenses involved in launching my project. This will cover supplies and labor. All supplies will be sourced in Marrakech through small local businesses. I will need to work with local jewelers, leather workers, and supply shops.</p>
<p>It is important to me to speak face to face with the people who will help me with this work, and to ensure that I am paying them fairly for their services. Supporting independent craftspeople is another important way that I hope to give something back to the city that gives me so much inspiration.</p>
<p>I will also need to provide supplies for my henna students. I want to be able to set each student up with whatever she needs to learn quickly and efficiently so that she can be working in her new field as soon as she is ready. Henna supplies can for the most part be found locally in Marrakech, and the money used to purchase them goes back into the local economy. Over time, as the fashion company begins to make money, those profits will be put back into my teaching efforts. </p>
<p>Finally, I need to cover the fees involved in establishing sales outlets for my products, such as through an Etsy store, dedicated website, and other online retailers, and for shipping and insurance of my products to boutiques. The more successful my venture is, the more often I will be able to return to Marrakech to continue working with my henna students there. </p>
<h3>What do you get? Great perks!</h3>
<p>Marrakech, the city that allowed this opportunity to come into being, is a riot for the senses. Nothing in Marrakech is ordinary, even down to a simple postcard, and the magic of this ancient city is a true inspiration. </p>
<p>Along with my sincere thanks, you can choose your donation level and receive a little thank you gift in return, something just for you from this magical place. Choose a postcard, a henna art print, a charm, a selection of traditional beauty products, or even a piece of custom jewelry. </p>
<h3>Why jewelry?</h3>
<p>I could have just asked for donations to cover the cost of teaching these classes, but in that situation, when the money's gone, it's gone. By starting a business which will continue to earn revenue, I have a way to take the seed money I gather here, and grow it into a project that becomes self sustaining over time. Profits from the jewelry company will directly fund my teaching activities, and as long as that business remains successful, I will be able to continue running classes. </p>
<p>Jewelry has been a passion of mine for years, and with this project I get to bring my ideas to life. It's an amazing creative outlet for me, and one that brings benefit to countless others through the classes it supports.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Allow me to relate the story of one of my students, a Moroccan woman named Fatiha. She excelled at henna and was really a natural, and we spent the better part of a day practicing and drawing designs.</p>
<p>Later on, a mutual friend related to me what Fatiha had told her: Fatiha told her that nobody had ever been so nice to her, and she was so happy to have this new skill that she can use to make a living for her family. She had also had her entire outfit made just for the occasion, as if she was going to a wedding, because she said she had never been so honored in her life as to be invited to the henna class. When I heard that, I think my heart broke open, and I knew that I had found my mission. I have to go back so that I can keep doing this work!</p>
<p>My first experiences in Morocco were the most humbling, awe inspiring, and uplifting I have ever had. To see that I could make a difference in people's lives through my art was extremely powerful, and gave my whole existence as an artist a greater meaning that I could not have created alone. <strong>I have always believed that art can change lives, but now I am certain, and I have seen just how much good it can do.</strong> By setting up my project, I will be able to continue traveling to Morocco and helping the local women find work, earn income, and feed their families.</p>
<p>Now all I need is your help to get me back to Morocco so I can continue what I started. Thanks so much for your support!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help get the word out by telling friends, family, neighbors, and anyone you know who values art and adornment that gives back! Your help publicizing this campaign is invaluable!</p>
<p>By taking a minute to share this on your facebook, twitter, tumblr, or pinterest, you are doing me a great favor and helping me reach more people than I could possibly reach alone. I can't do it without you! Thank you!</p></div>","My name is Nic Tharpa Cartier. I have been henna artist, jewelry maker, and clothing and textile designer for many years.

Calendars and time keeping were spawned by the heavens above, by the sun and the moon, everything else followed.

Time is spatial and it is alive. The stunningly detailed LCD in the EQ takes a hold of this universal knowledge and creates a display of circular dials that will relate your space and time to the rotation of the earth and to the cycles of the sun and the moon.</p><p><u><strong>The black 24-hour circle of time.</strong></u><br/>This is by far the most essential time in society today. Everything runs according to it. Jet planes, shops, rock concerts, what have you, it all relates back to this time. When something begins and when it ends, when to meet, when to leave. In 1883 the powers that be divided the world into 24 time zones, on average 15 degrees each, even though over land the TZ border follows geographical specifics and can vary greatly. All time calculations in the Equilibrium are based on UTC time.</p><p>In the EQ the 24-hour dial has a tritium tube for every hour and markers at quarter and half hours.</p><p><u><strong>The orange sun circle.</strong></u><br/>Next to the 24-hour dial the orange sun circle gives you the time data for the sun. Sunrise and sunset, times for morning and evening twilight, solar high noon or zenith, and finally solar midnight. The dark area gives you nighttime, the checkered part gives you twilight and the light orange part indicates daytime.</p><p><u><strong>The yellow moon circle.</strong></u><br/>The inner yellow circle will give you time for moonrise and moonset and lunar high noon or midnight. When the moon is up and when it is down. This circle can also be used to display SR/SS for an alternate location.<br/>The moon phase display is accompanied by waxing /waning arrows.</p><p><u><strong>The AM/PM circle.</strong></u><br/>Just outside the 24-dial, on the titanium collar that holds the crystal in place there is a shiny/satin finish on the two halves indicating AM/PM from 0000-1200</p><p><u><strong>The outer circle, the rotating bezel.</strong></u><br/>Offered in five different bezel insert designs in three different colors.

When people see it and hear my words of praise, they ask where they can get one! Of course, a watch with so many features requires investing a small amount of start-up time to figure out how to really use the features.

It will forever diminish its ability to hold a charge. Charging it before it goes really low is the best policy.

This is measured in ATM.  The EQ is constructed to 10 ATM. This means it can be taken down to 100 meters depth without leaking.  It also means, and many watch buyers don’t know this, that the crown or buttons cannot be operated while submerged or in contact. If you do you will momentarily breach the double o-ring seal and the outside water pressure will turn your watch into an aquarium quicker than you can say it.

I simply wanted to know when the sun would rise the next morning. To catch the first rays on a quiet beach walk. My gleamingly beautiful Rolex Submariner was of absolutely no use at all.</p><p>I checked around and quickly learned that the daily passing of the sun, the most fundamental timekeeper of all, had never ever been captured in a wristwatch. How come it had been ignored? I quickly learned why. Only through incredibly complex astronomical algorithms based on latitude and longitude could the sun’s path and timing be predicted accurately. I decided to make my own.</p><p>At first I wanted the watch to be a mechanical masterpiece. At the 1997 Basel  fair I arranged a meeting with an engineer with the renowned German watchmaker Glashutte. After speaking for a few minutes he just smiled and cut me off. He said that if I wanted to capture all that time data in a mechanical movement, I would be carrying a backpack. We laughed and had another beer.</p><p>It proved that only with digital chip technology was it possible to capture the nuanced cycles of the sun and the moon on your wrist.

We are gunning to get all existing pre-orders shipped by mid to end of February. In February our new web site will go live. You can see a preview of it by clicking on the link below. It is still under some refinement and will keep on evolving, but it is close.http://www.yeswatch.com   The very first order of 3 EQ's shipped to Jan in London.He and another dear friend Lars are quite the wine connoisseurs. You can’t go wrong drinking with these guys. I remember many, many moons ago the three of us sharing some bottles well into a warm summer night in the South of France. Jan offered to put in the first $50K to get the programming started for what eventually became the Equilibrium. Without their bravery we would not be here today. Forever grateful.The Fab Four:Jan, Gunnar, Bjørn and Lars at http://www.solsiden.no in Oslo, Norway.We are very excited to finally bring the EQ to your wrist. The first production batch of EQ’s that we received last week is testing flawlessly, that has gotta count for something. Thanks for your endless patience. Phil Baker has been wearing the Equilibrium for a week. He has been developing and reviewing scores of products for 40 years.

I simply wanted to know when the sun would rise the next morning. Go for a beach walk at the first rays. My gleamingly beautiful Rolex Submariner was of no use at all. So I decided to make my own watch.”           Bjorn Kartomten           Founder, YES watch 
Epic Time Keeping on your Wrist. No other watch on the planet offers the functionality and wealth of time information that the new 24-hour Equilibrium collection from YES watch does. There is no comparison. This is the most unique time piece ever.Many moons ago we decided to grab hold of the true essences of time and make that the foundation of the extraordinarily unique 24-hour watches our team has gone on to produce since 1999. It was not an exercise in design for the sake of design; it was an exercise in design for the most comprehensive presentation of time ever offered on your wrist. It was a calling.At a glance the EQ will give your hours, minutes and seconds as well as times for sunrise, sunset and twilight, moonrise, moonset and moon phase plus alert you to solstices, equinoxes and cross quarter days for exactly where you are. It also has a range of alarms, an electronic compass along with a host of other time data information and features.The unique design has one 24-hour hand and a 24-hour dial to which the multiple circular dials sync up with. These are the Equilibrium hardware specifications:48x17mm titanium case with sapphire crystal in silver-tone or IP black with water-resistance to 10 ATM .-3 or 5 link titanium bracelets with locking clasp.-Choice of silicon, leather and NATO straps.-Choice of 5 rotating bezels in 3 different colors with mirror backed orange/yellow sun/moon stones.-High resolution near white positive TDF LCD. Black negative non TDF LCD by request. TDF means Transflective Display Film which greatly increases perceived contrast in LCD. In a negative LCD however, TDF has an adverse effect.-Inner 24-hour dial with 24 tritium T100 tubes, plus one tube on the analog hand, and a bright luminescent backlight. Together they provide a gorgeous nighttime viewing experience. See this link for more info on what T100 means: http://tritiumreview.blogspot.com/2012/06/tritium-watches_8697.html-The master quartz crystal is attached to the PCB and controls all the timings. This master is connected directly to CPU.  The timing and the accuracy of the Ronda analog drive are also driven from this CPU. The computer controlled analog hand and the digital time is automatically synchronized.-Custom made lithium ion polymer rechargeable battery with 2-3 months of battery life on a full night charge. Expected battery life is 5 years.-Comes in a strong custom presentation box with room for additional straps, jeweler’s tools, recharge clip with USB wire and Instruction Manual.-Two year limited warranty.Even though it looks like it, these pictures were not taken in a submarine, but in a bar late at night. Regardless of circumstances the tritium tubes and backlight will make nighttime reading crystal clear.Following the Sun and the Moon.Once you study time keeping beyond the springs and screws and luxury bragging rights they have made you think it is all about, you will find a millennia long timeline of fascinating evolution, understanding and history. Calendars and time keeping were spawned by the heavens above, by the sun and the moon, everything else followed. It is in this realm of wisdom and awareness that the Equilibrium finds its platform and ancestry. What a fashionista might be hawking as trending today is kinda completely irrelevant. Time is timeless.-This is the man-made time data the Equilibrium keeps track of.-Hours, minutes and seconds in AM/PM or 2400 format-City name. 587 cities worldwide have been pre-programmed into the watch. It can also be set by LAT/LON, TZ and DST-Year, date, month and day-LAT/LON-TZ and DST   -DOY & WEEK #Any quartz movement has an accuracy of about plus/minus 20 seconds a month. It comes with the territory. In the EQ software program we have added a +/- 60 seconds accuracy adjustment capability of the quartz oscillator. Once you have determined the variation in your watch you can trim the EQ to an accuracy of plus/minus 1 second a month.  The Circles of Time in the Equilibrium.Time isn’t linear and it isn’t just a number. Time is spatial and it is alive. The stunningly detailed LCD in the EQ takes a hold of this universal knowledge and creates a display of circular dials that will relate your space and time to the rotation of the earth and to the cycles of the sun and the moon.The black 24-hour circle of time.This is by far the most essential time in society today. Everything runs according to it. Jet planes, shops, rock concerts, what have you, it all relates back to this time. When something begins and when it ends, when to meet, when to leave. In 1883 the powers that be divided the world into 24 time zones, on average 15 degrees each, even though over land the TZ border follows geographical specifics and can vary greatly. All time calculations in the Equilibrium are based on UTC time.In the EQ the 24-hour dial has a tritium tube for every hour and markers at quarter and half hours.The orange sun circle.Next to the 24-hour dial the orange sun circle gives you the time data for the sun. Sunrise and sunset, times for morning and evening twilight, solar high noon or zenith, and finally solar midnight. The dark area gives you nighttime, the checkered part gives you twilight and the light orange part indicates daytime.The yellow moon circle.The inner yellow circle will give you time for moonrise and moonset and lunar high noon or midnight. When the moon is up and when it is down. This circle can also be used to display SR/SS for an alternate location.The moon phase display is accompanied by waxing /waning arrows.The AM/PM circle.Just outside the 24-dial, on the titanium collar that holds the crystal in place there is a shiny/satin finish on the two halves indicating AM/PM from 0000-1200The outer circle, the rotating bezel.Offered in five different bezel insert designs in three different colors. You choose which one makes the most sense for you.At the push of a button the following time data will read out in the dot-matrix. It is accurate to plus/minus 2 minutes:-Times for sunrise/zenith/sunset/civil twilight/nautical twilight/astronomical twilight-Times for moonrise/lunar noon/moonset/% luminance/date and time of next new moon/time and date of full moonAlerting you to solstices, equinoxes and cross-quarter days.On the 8 main turning points of the sun the inner yellow dial will alert you to the event.  The inner yellow circle will display a gradual checkered pattern as the year progresses. At the top of the hour the event name as well as exact time for it is displayed.The EQ pictured above and below has been fitted with the solunar bezel, which creates the cleanest design. If less is more, this is the one for you, but any of the 5 bezels in black, orange or yellow metallic will look great. The bezel, as well as the strap colors, are yours to pick, tell us which one you want. ""If you're like me and want the ultimate watch that would do absolutely everything except perhaps tell time on Mars, then the YES Equilibrium is the watch for you. I've been beta-testing this watch for the past 3 or 4 months and have fallen in love with both its functionality and its design. I never had a watch that generated so much interest. When people see it and hear my words of praise, they ask where they can get one! Of course, a watch with so many features requires investing a small amount of start-up time to figure out how to really use the features. But that's a small cost in exchange for so much benefit.The beta version had a few problems with power consumption, along with some minor design flaws here and there. But these have now been attended to and the final, commercial version of the watch should be available in a few weeks. I can hardly wait!""     John Casti, Vienna, Austria

Please note that the watch pictured above will have a yellow and black bezel in the final version.The ultimate time partner that handle battlefields as well as boardrooms.I think of this as the workhorse in our EQ collection. The subtle wear-resistant satin finish case fitted with a sturdy 5-link Jubilee bracelet in lightweight titanium and a sapphire crystal can’t be beat. No matter how rough and tumble your life style is my guess is that you are going to need sleep way before this watch will quit on you.Pilots, astronomers, travelers, military personnel, outdoors men, boaters, healers, scientists, bon vivants and watch collectors alike will all find the EQ of great intelligence offering coordination no ordinary watch can ever match. There is no end to what tasks or events customers have told us their YES watch has helped them approach with calm, confidence and success. The EQ takes time keeping to the next level, it takes guessing out of time.Check out this link for some stories from our past:http://www.yeswatch.com/wrist-watch/timekeeper/press-news.html  Twilight, this most magical time of the day, has been included in the EQ. At a glance the checkered pattern in the outer orange sun circle will give you the combined duration of all three of them. By pushing a button you can get the exact range for civil, nautical and astronomical twilight to the minute.Click on this link to see video of the Time Review feature in the Equilibrium:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe_uJ2npgy8 The black beauty.There is something about black that is always beautiful. Like that little black dress that all women have in their closet. Who knows what the attraction truly is, but here it is on the Equilibrium. 10 micron deep black IP plating, polished to a high gloss on the case coupled with the classic Presidents bracelet.There isn’t a single calendar in the history of humanity that hasn’t attached itself to the sun. During each year we cycle through its 8 main turning points: 2 equinoxes when the days and nights are identical in duration, 2 solstices where the sun is either at it highest or lowest in the sky and 4 cross quarter dates halfway between each of them. As you study calendars you will find that cultures worldwide have repeatedly linked faith-based celebrations around these events. The EQ alerts you to every one of them. At the top of the hour the dot matrix will spell out its name and time of passing for exactly where you are to the minute. No other watch on the planet does this.  Click on this link to see a video of the different Modes of the EQ:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzEmzKrZ6Ow The choice of professionals.If sometimes you need stealth, unobtrusive power or just must to be in the know, then this is the watch for you. The tough black all satin case finish with a near scratch proof sapphire crystal will faithfully stand by your timing task at hand.Any quartz movement have an accuracy of about plus/minus 20 seconds a month, it comes with the territory. You think the 32768 vibrations per second would guarantee accuracy but by time the oscillator has been manufactured you got variations. In the EQ software program we have added a +/- 60 seconds accuracy adjustment capability of the quartz oscillator. Once you have determined the variation in your watch you can set the EQ to compensate for it to the second. A very nifty feature, the IM will tell you how.  Click on this link to see the different Alarms in the EQ:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_39lGon_lM Mind over Matter.In a mindful and beautiful design that focuses on content, application and wear, while throwing fads and frills to the side, the Equilibrium is for those who are ready to graduate from the ordinary to the special. This is the one that carefully and accurately reconnects man-made and natural circadian rhythms. This is for the part of your soul that nurtures a free and independent thought. This is your time.Alarms, stopwatch, 7 languages and a compass.Watches are always in one form or another about timing. To that end we have added a range of alarm options to the Equilibrium. The alarm sound may not wake you from a deep sleep but it certainly is loud enough when you are waiting for a sign. Here they are:~Daily Alarm. This is your regular set alarm with a 10-minute snooze.~99 minute timer.~Sunrise/set alarm. Chimes at event time with pre-alarm time of 0-60 minutes as set by user.~Cuckoo alarm. Like Grandpas old clock, chimes at the top of the hour with 00 -24 hour range set by user.~999 day countdown/up with user set event date.~Regatta Alarm. The official countdown sequence used in official regattas. Automatically converts to stopwatch when start is successful.All the alarms relate to whichever location your watch is set for.The Equilibrium also has a stopwatch with lap times that counts to 1/100 of a second. Lap times kept in memory for review until the stopwatch is reset.The 7 languages for menu settings and readouts are: English, Spanish, German, French, Norwegian, Italian and Portuguese.The spot on accurate electronic compass has N/S/E/W arrows and a digital readout of degrees. The analog hand will stay fixed at 1200 which will align to 00 N readout. The practical applications and insights ofthe EQ are endless.There is no end to the uses and tasks customers have told us their Yes watches have enabled them to manage better and with greater accuracy. The Equilibrium is a superior tool for confident timing. It is also a great conversation starter.World travelers. Instantly ground yourself to local time. Carefully used it can effectively help you overcome jet lag. Once you set your location the hand and LCD display sets itself automatically compensating for TZ and DST.Astronomers. With the added feature of twilight, your best time to view the universe just became even more accurate to predict.Photographers. Professionals can plan for the best natural light conditions and when to shoot throughout the day and night. You can plan to shoot at the golden hour, to up your Instagram game!Military. Operations are critically planned around the availability of light, or the lack thereof. They got bin Laden on a moonless night, it was not a coincidence. The 2400 time display makes it a natural for the Special Forces.Pilots. Flying changes dramatically after dark, like night and day. All of a sudden you see nothing, except maybe artificial lights and the horizon disappears. If JFK junior had an EQ he might have been the President today.Boating. The same goes for boating. The last thing you want to run into is a rock or a log after dark. Much better to be in harbor or anchored before the sun is setting.Motor biking. Driving changes drastically after dark. In an unfamiliar spot especially, you might be best off planning to be back at the hotel before the sun goes down.Outdoorsmen. Not much brings you closer to nature than camping, fishing and hunting. With the EQ you can predict the rhythm of day and night exactly. Plan the activities with complete confidence.Watch collectors. If you are a watch enthusiast your collection is not complete until you have one of these unique timepieces. You can only have so many watches giving you hours, minutes and seconds before they are all just the same.Moments of sanctuary. A quiet time, a prayer or a kindred ritual aligned with the divine rhythms of the sun and the moon makes the experience just so much richer and stronger. Try it sometime. Insights of great timing for thosewho travel light. For the world traveler there isn’t a better wristwatch out there. Not only does the EQ give you time for 600 cities worldwide adjusted for TZ and DST, but it also instantly grounds you to the local rhythm of day and night and your place in it. With this unique insight you can help overcome jet lag quicker and plan your activities to safely do things before and after dark sets in.If you are way out there the EQ can also be set by your actual LAT/LON giving you sun and moon time data to an accuracy of plus minus 2 minutes. Click on this link to see a video of how the Compass in the EQ works:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njJ0uiLan-Q Your bezel­ choice.The rotating bezel offers the ability to keep track of an additional universe of time keeping at a glance. It has been around for a long time, most prominently used on dive watches. Knowing how long you could stay submerged were of critical importance, nobody wanted the bends.With the unique day and night perspective in our watches we have designed 5 bezels that each offers a different function. You choose yours. With your Indiegogo pre-order send me an e-mail at bj@yeswatch.com to indicate which one you want, please include IG order number.The bezels will also be offered for sale individually as replacement or exchange for $39 each.The bezels are omni-directional to allow for maximum accuracy in adjustment. We have paid extra attention to getting a firm friction on the bezel to keep it stay in one place once set.The bezel inserts are held in place by strong double stick tape. The IM will tell you how to exchange them. The bezel insert you tear out will most likely not be usable again, but it is a great way to refresh your watch when the time comes. Your titanium bracelet choice.There is no stronger and arguably no more beautiful metal bracelet than the classic 3-link President design. The 5-link follows a close second. The high gloss shiny EQ case gets the 3-link bracelet, the more subdued satin case get the 5-link. That goes for both silver-tone and black versions. The bracelet lug nuts are 22mm and will fit any standard bracelet. The bracelet is attached with heavy-duty spring pins.When pre-ordering an EQ with metal bracelet, please send e-mail to bj@yeswatch.com with your preference. Replacement bracelets will be available for sale on our web site. Your leather, NATO and silicon strap choices.We found a cool black leather strap with a checkered pattern that plays well with our watch and bezel design. For a tan strap the classic plain one is the one that counts. All the buckles will have the logo engraved. There are a gazillion NATO straps out there. We are starting with these three. The orange will light up just about any room. The  silicone straps offers a comfortable and solid wear if rough and tumble is part of your daily life. When you buy a watch with the titanium bracelet you get one of each, with your choice of color. Let me know which colors when you pre-order.If you go for the $590 pre-order pick the one strap you want, let me know at bj@yeswatch.com and we’ll fit it on for you.All the straps will be for sale individually on our web site. Packaging custom built for secure worldwide shipping.The Equilibrium watch is held firmly in place in a velvet cradle and will be wrapped in a sheet of protective vinyl. Next to it is a small compartment with a padded lid that will stay firmly closed even if the package does a couple of somersaults on its way to you. Inside is room for the recharge clip and wire, the jeweler’s tools, the bezel oil and other knickknacks needed to keep your new watch humming. The lid has a drawing with buttons and basic watch functions called out. Behind the ledge that holds the instruction manual in place are two elastic pockets for spare straps and bracelets. A solid hinge with firm resistance will keep the strong, lightweight plastic box shut tight even if it happens to roll around in the back seat of your car. Very nice, very sturdy, very practical. We will set the watch before shipping.The astronomical algorithms of the sun and the moon are complex. The Equilibrium has a wealth of time keeping data and it is the kind of watch were you want to read the Instruction Manual to get full use of it. You will find the operations to be quite intuitive, but for starters you are going to want to spend some time with it to familiarize yourself.Smart watches and phones only last a day or two; with the EQ you can go on a long vacation and not have to worry about the battery. The battery lasts for at least 30 days, and that is far better than most rechargeable watches on the market.  Recharging the EQ battery.The perpeteum mobile has yet to be invented even though we keep on trying. The EQ has a hardcore lithium recharge battery set-up. We custom built the battery for maximum size, thinness and longevity. Simply clip the charger on to your watch, make sure the contact are clean and engage, the clip light will turn to red when it happens and leave it in overnight. It will be green in the morning. It connects via a regular USB contact to your computer or battery adapter.The critical part about a rechargeable battery is to never let it go flat and sit like that for any length of time. It will forever diminish its ability to hold a charge. Charging it before it goes really low is the best policy. Nothing lasts forever, after an estimated 5 years you will have to replace the battery. Watches and water will always be at odds.Decades ago the term water-proof was used, but since nothing truly is, take anything deep enough and it will leak, the industry changed the term to water resistance back in the 70’s. This is measured in ATM.  The EQ is constructed to 10 ATM. This means it can be taken down to 100 meters depth without leaking.  It also means, and many watch buyers don’t know this, that the crown or buttons cannot be operated while submerged or in contact. If you do you will momentarily breach the double o-ring seal and the outside water pressure will turn your watch into an aquarium quicker than you can say it. Now you know.I have been ocean swimming with the EQ for weeks now and I am confident that with normal use the internal cavity will stay perfectly dry.  Reconnecting the cycles of the sun and the moon with hours, minutes and seconds.I guess you can say it all started on a beach in St. Barts back in the mid 90’s. I simply wanted to know when the sun would rise the next morning. To catch the first rays on a quiet beach walk. My gleamingly beautiful Rolex Submariner was of absolutely no use at all.I checked around and quickly learned that the daily passing of the sun, the most fundamental timekeeper of all, had never ever been captured in a wristwatch. How come it had been ignored? I quickly learned why. Only through incredibly complex astronomical algorithms based on latitude and longitude could the sun’s path and timing be predicted accurately. I decided to make my own.At first I wanted the watch to be a mechanical masterpiece. At the 1997 Basel  fair I arranged a meeting with an engineer with the renowned German watchmaker Glashutte. After speaking for a few minutes he just smiled and cut me off. He said that if I wanted to capture all that time data in a mechanical movement, I would be carrying a backpack. We laughed and had another beer.It proved that only with digital chip technology was it possible to capture the nuanced cycles of the sun and the moon on your wrist. A curious dichotomy and blessing inextricably entwined.In 2002 the Worldwatch II was updated to include times for moonrise and moonset. Big strikes back.In 1999 we incorporated the YES watch company in Marin County, California and got to work with our Swiss and Hong Kong partners. Creating perfection was and is a whole lot easier said than done, but 18 months later we proudly released our first collection, the WorldWatch.It was a rude awakening. In spite of being a very lean and mean time machine, the case measured in at a solid 43x16mm. The size prompted a nearly wholesale rejection in the market place. It turned out that the watch industry was not in the time keeping business, they were in the jewelry business. Time keeping ability seemed almost irrelevant. Professionals picked up on the time keeping insights offered.Those who had a practical application for the time data offered, soon emerged. Astronomers gave us our first love. Photographers, cinematographers, pilots, boaters, world travelers, military personnel and watch collectors soon followed suit. With the YES watch they could all plan their activities with much greater accuracy and confidence than ever before.In 2004 we sent a sample of the Zulu watch to the Chief Astronomer with the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London. His scientific and historical review was stellar and I was beyond flattered when he immediately put the watch on display, in the Museum collection. That is when I knew my instincts were legit.       The titanium with sapphire crystal  48x16mm collection: Zulu, Kundalini and Inca.  The Tati and Luna collections have an all digital module and fits snugly to a smaller wrist. Check out this link for an interview that tells more of the story:http://www.yeswatch.com/wrist-watch/timekeeper/press-bjorn-kartomten.htmlOver the years we have gotten the kindest reviews, promotions and watch sales from all over the planet. The logos above represent many of those who helped us, we are most grateful to you all. As we are to all our dear customers who have shown us loyalty and love. Thank you!  Listening intently.There is no better product feed back than what you get from caring customers, from those who plunked down hard earned cash to buy. Over the years we have listened intently and taken notes. Much of what we have learned has been incorporated into our new Equilibrium collection. It is a great leap forward both in terms of time keeping ability and accuracy, as well as in a magnificently crafted titanium case and bracelet. No detail has gone unnoticed.On August 15, 2016, after years of development, testing and refinement I finally held in my hands a fully operational Equilibrium v6 prototype module. It is the heart of the watch, what makes it tick and is an incredibly intricate engineering job. It was a beautiful moment, I almost cried.The very first photograph of the fully operational EQUILIBRIUM watch module, compared with my trusted world traveling time keeping companion, the marine Zulu. Two of the four layers in the PCB that runs all operations, LCD, analog hand, back light, alarms and power supply. The LCD screen offers the most power consumption effective display available. The wires shown are the invisible connections between the segments, but they are there. The titanium case is machined to extreme tolerances in order to hold the sapphire crystal, 24 hour dial with tritium tubes and watch module securely in place. Double O-rings on all push buttons for 10 ATM water-resistance. Available with your choice of 5 different bezels: 24 hour, AM/PM, Symbol, Solunar and Roman available in black, orange and yellow. These 5 bezels can be fitted to the watch of your choice! A snapshot of what is inside. The PCB has 4 micro thin conductive layers that connects the myriad of components to the LCD, compass, alarm, back light, power and other functions. Quality Is Job Number One.Manufacturing a quality product is easier said than done. Ask Apple or ask your local microbrewer. The answer will be the same. It takes everything you got and then some. We are honored to work with a team of seasoned watch development professionals out of HK with manufacturing capabilities in China. The Swiss most certainly make some astonishingly beautiful mechanical watches, but the hard truth is that you have to go to Asia for  high-complication quartz and ana-digit watch manufacturing. Various watch parts are sourced from Japan, Thailand, Switzerland and Taiwan. They all specialize in watch making and have decades of experience. Each of them works with a range of sub vendors. Our four key partners are: ALPHASOFT. A boutique programming group located on the Hong Kong island. They have been with us since 1999. Our programmer is our rock in HK, I trust her 100%. She is as detailed oriented and caring as they come. KEY TIME. A quality watch assembly shop in HK who also specialize in tritium tubes. They have been involved with the Equilibrium development for the last three years. They also manage the titanium case and bracelet manufacturing. UDC. A state of the art module manufacturing company. Been part of our development for the last two years. RONDA. A state of the art Swiss movement manufacturer with factories in Switzerland and Asia. We have worked with them since 1999.   After a long day working in Hong Kong a walk along the Kowloon water-front offers a spectacular view of Hong Kong Island.",50.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p> </p>
<p><strong>1. How can I contribute to the campaign? </strong></p>
<p>Anyone can contribute. You just need to have a PayPal account to pay the perk. If you do not have a PayPal account but have a credit card, you can use the ""Pay as guest"" feature in PayPal.</p>
<p>For instructions on how to Pay as a Guest on PayPal, please visit: <a href=""http://support.indiegogo.com/entries/20501786-how-to-contribute-via-paypal-without-a-paypal-account"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> How to Contribute via PayPal without a PayPal Account</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2. How many modules can be connected to the parent/owner’s module simultaneously?</strong></p>
<p>Up to 5 modules simultaneously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3. What type of battery is used in the modules (rechargeable or replaceable)?</strong></p>
<p>The Findster modules use rechargeable batteries. To recharge the battery module, simply connectthe module to a Findster Charger (included in the perk) or insert it into the basestation .</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4. Can other unauthorised modules be connected to my kid's module?</strong></p>
<p>Not unless they are explicitly allowed (monitoring group).</p>
<p>Other guardian modules could serve as a gateway for sending data to the web service, but only if there is authorization from the owner of these modules.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5. How is the connection established between Findsters? How does the guardian’s module connect with the smartphone?</strong></p>
<p>The pairing of the modules is made possible via the mobile application.</p>
<p>In the smartphone, you can see a list of compatible Findster modules and the desired module is selected using its identifier (name associated with the device), similarly to a Bluetooth connection. This connection only needs to be done once.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>6. Why are two modules necessary?</strong></p>
<p>The Findster’s secret sauce is its proprietary RF technology that allows for two modules to communicate in a range of up to 1km. If we were using just one module to communicate with the smartphone – as a Bluetooth tracker does – then we would only be able to achieve 50m of communication range.</p>
<p>We weren’t satisfied with that range, so we’ve developed our own technology. It adds an extra module to the system but enables us to communicate at a range of up to 1km.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>7. What happens if the smartphone is too far from the guardian's module?</strong></p>
<p>With Findster you will never be able to lose your guardian modules anywhere. What Findster does is it constantly monitors the distance between the smartphone and the guardian module. If this distance is greater than a preset threshold, an alert is posted on the smartphone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>8. When my kid is missing, will other Findster users be able to help?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, because Findster has networking capabilities. A missing child can transmit its location anonymously using other Findsters. The information is relayed through our web service to its destiny.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>9. What is the purpose of the basestation?</strong></p>
<p>The basestation (BS) allows you to extend the coverage area of the Findster network. Since the base station does not have the same power and space constraints of the Findster modules, we were able to devise a more powerful version of our RF communication system.</p>
<p>Moreover, being Wi-Fi enabled, it establishes a link between the base station and all your Findster modules, even if you’re outside of your home. So, once the BS is connected to the Internet, parents/guardians will be able to track their kids remotely.</p>
<p>The base station also serves as a charging dock for up to 4 modules simultaneously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>10. Is data privacy guaranteed?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the Findster system ensures that only authorized modules have access to the data exchanged between them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>11. Can I share access to my child module with other people I trust?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. If the module is associated with an account, its owner can easily share access with other users and create a network of caregivers.</p>

 Findster’s Secret Sauce
The Child module was designed specifically to be comfortable when applied yet secure. This module includes a high-precision GPS system and a 3-axis accelerometer that enables the detection of whether the child fell! 
Innovative wireless communication technology 
One of the Findster secrets is in its innovative wireless communication technology, used to establish communication between the child module and its guardian/parent module (or the child module and the Base Station).Our proprietary wireless protocol allows you to obtain communication range of 0.62 miles (1 km) between both modules, thereby eliminating the need to send the coordinates through a cellular connection.

You can increase the range and capabilities of Findster. 

The Findster ecosystem is composed of 5 components: - Parent/Guardian module- Child module- Portable charger- Smartphone App (Android and iOS).- Basestation (optional)
 
The Parent/Guardian module serves as a gateway between your smartphone and the module, enabling a long-range bi-directional communication between both. All the controls and displays of data are centralised in the Findster App. 
 

To increase the ubiquity and range of Findster you will be able to add a base station. It can be placed in strategic points, expanding your connection area and protecting who you care about even when you're not home.

 
The basestation can be placed, for example, in your home, powering a communication range of 1.24 miles (​​2 km). The basestation wireless communication uses the same proprietary protocol of the child module. However, because it has no restrictions in terms of battery consumption or size, we were able to design a system with a range 2x greater than the wearable module.

 hard to ""see"" what our display can 
really do, without seeing it live, just by the nature that it works with your two eyes. We 
are relying 
on the fact that people are already familiar with 3D from seeing movies 
and TV with glasses, and can understand the possibilities and excitement of 
finally removing 
glasses from the equation.  After 
thinking about it for awhile, I thought of a way that might give you a 
tiny bit of something different when you look at it on here, and it 
seemed to work. When you take a still of our display in a certain way, 
the image of a video being displayed in 3D seems to look a bit 
different than a normal image. </p><p>Below is my 6 year old daughter, Sophie, helping me demonstrate, with
 a bubble maker spraying into the air. If you sit back about 2 feet or
 so from your monitor and look at her compared to the background and 
bubbles, some of you might be able to notice an unusual amount of 
separation and focus between her and the surroundings. The effect is obviously 100
 times more dramatic when you see it on the display with your own eyes; 
but this is about as crafty as I could be with the optics for you to see
 something that you ordinarily shouldn't be able to notice with 
essentially one eye (camera) and then looking at it on your normal 2D screen. If 
you look at the bubbles at the top, especially the one right above her 
head, to some of you, it may actually appear to come out of your screen a
 tiny tiny amount. When you see it on the display, with your two eyes, 
looking in the desktop window makes you feel like you are looking into 
a tiny set; where you can see all the way back to the wall behind her, 
and she and the little bubbles come out of your screen and float in the air about a 1/2 inch 
to an inch from the face of the display, and it feels like you can reach out and pinch them between 
your fingers.  <br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/382899/files/20140220104447-ff584bbb11bb14e35a8dcfcb782034eb_large.png?1392921887"" src="""" style=""width: 574.66px; height: 431px;""/>Close up view of the display</p><p></p><p></p><p>Below is the startup panel to our test software.

<b>The Developers</b>
</h2><p></p><p>

We're a small group of people that have dared to take on the 
impossible before. John Prince and I, (Fori Owurowa), along with a small
 
group of supporters have spent time combining our expertise in our 
respective fields, spending the last few months refining ideas and 
inventing methods for low cost production of the technology.  
John has had a long career in optics and creating interesting things 
like thin film superconductors, and copper vapor lasers.  I have 
developed industry changing and fast 3D technology and software for many
 years (see: the 
current multi-award winning messiahStudio6 3D animation and rendering 
software <a href=""http://www.projectmessiah.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.projectmessiah.com</a>), and you can look me up on (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0654533/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.imdb.com</a>)
 for some technology and visual effects credits. Both of us have had our
 share of pushing past what 
people have told us was too difficult, too expensive, or seemed 
impossible, so this challenge fell right in line. During this project, 
we were literally two guys toiling away in a room, who discussed ideas 
for crazy things like:
 evaporating Sapphire, making flat radio telescopes, curved light, and 
the physics of how walls know the future of balls, over burgers and 
chili at lunch in Palo Alto and Arizona. We've developed a range of 
ideas over this time, in many different industries, and now we're ready 
to start raising money to put them into practice.</p><h2>
</h2><h2>Background of the Idea<br/>
</h2>I met John in Arizona back in Feb of 2013 through Brad Carvey. John 
was looking for someone to write some software who understood something 
about 3D and what he wanted to do; and Brad made the connection to me. 
John and his partner, Aleta, came into town and we met for lunch to 
discuss what they were doing, and where they were with it all. It was 
one of those things where you sit down and you're talking to someone, 
and where someone else would usually think ""this guy is talking crazy"", 
you instead understand exactly what they are talking about and 
immediately start to think about how to solve it. It was great to meet 
someone else with a ""let's do it"", ""lets start working on it right now"" 
attitude. John gave me the freedom to start pure, without limitations and we'd 
narrow things down later. A lot of the things we came up with were wild 
and wonderful, but much too expensive for just the average person, or way
 beyond the budget we had to try them yet. We decided that one of our 
criteria was to also create a technology that would be affordable, so it
 could be added to devices that made it accessible to everyone, 
relatively easy to manufacture, and create a format that was flexible 
and easy for other companies to adopt and license, so a wide variety of 
products could be created beyond what even we would think of. Nine months of ideas, testing and building, led to several breakthroughs with capture, streaming, and displaying. We had something that actually worked amazingly well, 
given the low precision tools we had to work with, and the stuff we built ourselves. John likens 
what we were doing to trying to achieve semiconductor precision with 
stone tools. We combined materials and invented our own processes where 
we couldn't find something that existed, or that we could get fast enough. 
 We made our own prototype camera, software, format and display, so that 
we could not only test the ideas, but prove that they worked. You know 
you've been working on something a lot when you walk into Lowes and Home
 
Depot so many times finding obscure parts and pieces to modify, that a guy who works there
 yells: “there he IS !”, when he sees you, as if he knew you would show 
up again sometime that day. <br/> We soon realized that the simple tools at our disposal would only take us so
 far 
in squeezing out those last bits of precision, and limited which ideas we
 
could try; so it became clear that to move to the next level, the types 
of 
things we would have to buy, would be beyond what we had for this 
project. While exploring funding possibilities, we took 
advantage of great resources like TechShop (<a href=""http://www.techshop.ws"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.techshop.ws</a><a href=""http://www.techshop.ws"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>) to help us try out fabrication and product design ideas on machines that we didn't have yet. It's a great place with great people that work there, that deserves a look if you are an inventor, 
or just someone wanting to try to start making things just for the fun 
of it.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/391252/files/20140224092523-waterjet.jpg?1393262723"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Picture of us cutting curves in a 2"" thick block of Acrylic with the waterjet cutter at Techshop Chandler, AZ<br/><h1><br/></h1><h1>What drove us to this?<br/>
</h1><h1></h1><h1>
</h1><p>Over 80% of 3D capable TVs purchased, have rarely been watched in 3D.
 People just don't want to bother wearing the glasses, or the extra 
expense of having to buy them for each person that wants to see. Can you
 imagine everyone at a sports bar trying to watch a game and wearing 3D 
glasses? or sitting all day in front of your desktop monitor taking on and off glasses to see 3D content or products online. That just didn't seem practical. If you're someone who wears 
glasses already, did anyone consider the fact that you have to put 
glasses over your glasses, to watch 3D? Young kids have a hard time 
keeping them on, and originally the one size fits all nature didn't 
fit their faces, so many parents just opt to see the 2D version of 
movies. We are daring to eliminate all of this forever. Creating a technology that adults, toddlers and even your dog can now view. We've put about all we 
can into this stage to make it a reality to a good level, but to really 
get it to where we'd like it to be, requires more expensive 
equipment than the two of us can provide, so that's why we're here; 
hoping that you see the same potential that we see. We ask that you put aside any 
preconceived notions; take a leap of faith, and a bold step into the 
future of possibility; and help us cast affordable NaturalVision3D (TM) 
depth into the eyes of all those who dare to see it. This is truly a 
chance to be part of technology history. At least we'd like to think so 
:)<br/></p><h2>Products and Potential<br/>
</h2>
<p>We're in the business of enabling people and companies to use and create new products with our technologies. In addition to the normal uses of enabling 3D cameras, displays, and software with nv3D ability, we'd like to introduce a concept that we're developing that wasn't possible until now. We present ...... <br/></p><h3>A Room With A View<br/>
</h3><p></p><p> A new concept in office and home environments: ""A Room With a Live NaturalVision3D View"". Think of it as, the window re-imagined. Take any home or office space room or cubical and create a personal digital window, with a 3D view of whatever you like, that you or anyone else passing by, can see without 3D glasses. We're working on creating an online system of broadcast views around the world, of beautiful and interesting places that people can tune into with their window. This window content can be still or live, and it's changeable to different things and locations whenever the mood suits you. Want a view of the beach?...tune into the live beach view and see the sunrise or set, time shift matched to your time zone, and see it like you were looking out of a window, in NaturalVision3D. Want an Aquarium wall display without the mess, that never gets old?...tune into the underwater view channel and see a window with life that is ever changing. You never know what may pass by. See the cycle of a day and night as you go through your day and night, where you are. Need a moment high in the mountains, or deep in the forest? Add 3D sound broadcast to complete the experience. A hidden waterfall in a far away place, creates a peaceful and inviting environment for lobbies, waiting rooms and spas. Watch a rainstorm move across the plains of America from your NY apartment. Want to look across your office while you work at a view of whales migrating live as the sun sets on a beautiful beach in Hawaii? You will. <br/></p><p></p><p>Do you have an exciting view or want to capture adventurous footage to share with other people all over the world? Many of us will never experience jumping off a mountain and flying through the air in a Wing Suit, or exploring a deep ocean trench, but we will at least have a better chance to see it, like you do. We're enabling people to have their own channel on our site and broadcast to everyone. Fund scientific research with a subscription channel where schools and everyday interested people can see fascinating things about your work, that they otherwise would never experience. Stand on the edge of a Volcano, so we can see and hear what you hear.  We have the ideas and the technology that can makes it all possible.

 hard to ""see"" what our display can 
really do, without seeing it live, just by the nature that it works with your two eyes. We 
are relying 
on the fact that people are already familiar with 3D from seeing movies 
and TV with glasses, and can understand the possibilities and excitement of 
finally removing 
glasses from the equation.  After 
thinking about it for awhile, I thought of a way that might give you a 
tiny bit of something different when you look at it on here, and it 
seemed to work. When you take a still of our display in a certain way, 
the image of a video being displayed in 3D seems to look a bit 
different than a normal image. Below is my 6 year old daughter, Sophie, helping me demonstrate, with
 a bubble maker spraying into the air. If you sit back about 2 feet or
 so from your monitor and look at her compared to the background and 
bubbles, some of you might be able to notice an unusual amount of 
separation and focus between her and the surroundings. The effect is obviously 100
 times more dramatic when you see it on the display with your own eyes; 
but this is about as crafty as I could be with the optics for you to see
 something that you ordinarily shouldn't be able to notice with 
essentially one eye (camera) and then looking at it on your normal 2D screen. If 
you look at the bubbles at the top, especially the one right above her 
head, to some of you, it may actually appear to come out of your screen a
 tiny tiny amount. When you see it on the display, with your two eyes, 
looking in the desktop window makes you feel like you are looking into 
a tiny set; where you can see all the way back to the wall behind her, 
and she and the little bubbles come out of your screen and float in the air about a 1/2 inch 
to an inch from the face of the display, and it feels like you can reach out and pinch them between 
your fingers.  Close up view of the displayBelow is the startup panel to our test software. You can choose if you 
are displaying from images, from live cameras (internet, webcam, local 
etc.) and what format you want to display in (720P, 1080P etc). By 
setting it to server mode, you can have the software broadcast its 3D 
image to a receiving client through RTSP. The software is written in a 
combination of C and JAVA.nv3D Startup PanelHere's our test camera, with a few controls so we can try out tiny 
adjustments, and experiment with different arrangements and distances. It captures two images at 1080P at 30 FPS and live feed to a laptop through USB. We have successfully done up to 8 cameras simultaneously capturing and displaying live at 50FPS in debug mode. Close up view of the camera. Kind of looks like a little happy robot head. 
The Developers


We're a small group of people that have dared to take on the 
impossible before. John Prince and I, (Fori Owurowa), along with a small
 
group of supporters have spent time combining our expertise in our 
respective fields, spending the last few months refining ideas and 
inventing methods for low cost production of the technology.  
John has had a long career in optics and creating interesting things 
like thin film superconductors, and copper vapor lasers.  I have 
developed industry changing and fast 3D technology and software for many
 years (see: the 
current multi-award winning messiahStudio6 3D animation and rendering 
software www.projectmessiah.com), and you can look me up on (www.imdb.com)
 for some technology and visual effects credits. Both of us have had our
 share of pushing past what 
people have told us was too difficult, too expensive, or seemed 
impossible, so this challenge fell right in line. During this project, 
we were literally two guys toiling away in a room, who discussed ideas 
for crazy things like:
 evaporating Sapphire, making flat radio telescopes, curved light, and 
the physics of how walls know the future of balls, over burgers and 
chili at lunch in Palo Alto and Arizona. We've developed a range of 
ideas over this time, in many different industries, and now we're ready 
to start raising money to put them into practice.
Background of the Idea
I met John in Arizona back in Feb of 2013 through Brad Carvey. John 
was looking for someone to write some software who understood something 
about 3D and what he wanted to do; and Brad made the connection to me. 
John and his partner, Aleta, came into town and we met for lunch to 
discuss what they were doing, and where they were with it all. It was 
one of those things where you sit down and you're talking to someone, 
and where someone else would usually think ""this guy is talking crazy"", 
you instead understand exactly what they are talking about and 
immediately start to think about how to solve it. It was great to meet 
someone else with a ""let's do it"", ""lets start working on it right now"" 
attitude. John gave me the freedom to start pure, without limitations and we'd 
narrow things down later. A lot of the things we came up with were wild 
and wonderful, but much too expensive for just the average person, or way
 beyond the budget we had to try them yet. We decided that one of our 
criteria was to also create a technology that would be affordable, so it
 could be added to devices that made it accessible to everyone, 
relatively easy to manufacture, and create a format that was flexible 
and easy for other companies to adopt and license, so a wide variety of 
products could be created beyond what even we would think of. Nine months of ideas, testing and building, led to several breakthroughs with capture, streaming, and displaying. We had something that actually worked amazingly well, 
given the low precision tools we had to work with, and the stuff we built ourselves. John likens 
what we were doing to trying to achieve semiconductor precision with 
stone tools. We combined materials and invented our own processes where 
we couldn't find something that existed, or that we could get fast enough. 
 We made our own prototype camera, software, format and display, so that 
we could not only test the ideas, but prove that they worked. You know 
you've been working on something a lot when you walk into Lowes and Home
 
Depot so many times finding obscure parts and pieces to modify, that a guy who works there
 yells: “there he IS !”, when he sees you, as if he knew you would show 
up again sometime that day.  We soon realized that the simple tools at our disposal would only take us so
 far 
in squeezing out those last bits of precision, and limited which ideas we
 
could try; so it became clear that to move to the next level, the types 
of 
things we would have to buy, would be beyond what we had for this 
project. While exploring funding possibilities, we took 
advantage of great resources like TechShop (www.techshop.ws) to help us try out fabrication and product design ideas on machines that we didn't have yet. It's a great place with great people that work there, that deserves a look if you are an inventor, 
or just someone wanting to try to start making things just for the fun 
of it.Picture of us cutting curves in a 2"" thick block of Acrylic with the waterjet cutter at Techshop Chandler, AZWhat drove us to this?

Over 80% of 3D capable TVs purchased, have rarely been watched in 3D.
 People just don't want to bother wearing the glasses, or the extra 
expense of having to buy them for each person that wants to see. Can you
 imagine everyone at a sports bar trying to watch a game and wearing 3D 
glasses? or sitting all day in front of your desktop monitor taking on and off glasses to see 3D content or products online. That just didn't seem practical. If you're someone who wears 
glasses already, did anyone consider the fact that you have to put 
glasses over your glasses, to watch 3D? Young kids have a hard time 
keeping them on, and originally the one size fits all nature didn't 
fit their faces, so many parents just opt to see the 2D version of 
movies. We are daring to eliminate all of this forever. Creating a technology that adults, toddlers and even your dog can now view. We've put about all we 
can into this stage to make it a reality to a good level, but to really 
get it to where we'd like it to be, requires more expensive 
equipment than the two of us can provide, so that's why we're here; 
hoping that you see the same potential that we see. We ask that you put aside any 
preconceived notions; take a leap of faith, and a bold step into the 
future of possibility; and help us cast affordable NaturalVision3D (TM) 
depth into the eyes of all those who dare to see it. This is truly a 
chance to be part of technology history. At least we'd like to think so 
:)Products and Potential

We're in the business of enabling people and companies to use and create new products with our technologies. In addition to the normal uses of enabling 3D cameras, displays, and software with nv3D ability, we'd like to introduce a concept that we're developing that wasn't possible until now. We present ...... A Room With A View
 A new concept in office and home environments: ""A Room With a Live NaturalVision3D View"". Think of it as, the window re-imagined. Take any home or office space room or cubical and create a personal digital window, with a 3D view of whatever you like, that you or anyone else passing by, can see without 3D glasses. We're working on creating an online system of broadcast views around the world, of beautiful and interesting places that people can tune into with their window. This window content can be still or live, and it's changeable to different things and locations whenever the mood suits you. Want a view of the beach?...tune into the live beach view and see the sunrise or set, time shift matched to your time zone, and see it like you were looking out of a window, in NaturalVision3D. Want an Aquarium wall display without the mess, that never gets old?...tune into the underwater view channel and see a window with life that is ever changing. You never know what may pass by. See the cycle of a day and night as you go through your day and night, where you are. Need a moment high in the mountains, or deep in the forest? Add 3D sound broadcast to complete the experience. A hidden waterfall in a far away place, creates a peaceful and inviting environment for lobbies, waiting rooms and spas. Watch a rainstorm move across the plains of America from your NY apartment. Want to look across your office while you work at a view of whales migrating live as the sun sets on a beautiful beach in Hawaii? You will. Do you have an exciting view or want to capture adventurous footage to share with other people all over the world? Many of us will never experience jumping off a mountain and flying through the air in a Wing Suit, or exploring a deep ocean trench, but we will at least have a better chance to see it, like you do. We're enabling people to have their own channel on our site and broadcast to everyone. Fund scientific research with a subscription channel where schools and everyday interested people can see fascinating things about your work, that they otherwise would never experience. Stand on the edge of a Volcano, so we can see and hear what you hear.  We have the ideas and the technology that can makes it all possible. Capture->Stream->Display->EosVision.Fund Use and TimelinesWe are looking at being able to deliver the first beta units to funders to try out in about 4-6 months.
Buy equipment & materials  (1-2 months). 

Test a few more versions and finalize designs & processes  (1-2 months). We have the ability to do this in-house. 
Explore manufacturers to produce and partner with  (2-3 months). We have plans to meet with some in just a few weeks.  
Start to manufacture  (3-4 months).
Launch ViewChannels(TM) on our new site, to begin basic broadcast of 3D RoomWithAView(TM) feeds and content.

Estimated shipping for hardware to begin in September 2014 (based on perk level, certain products will ship sooner than others). messiahStudio6
 software will be available to backers to download within 2-3 weeks of meeting our goal. Updated messiahStudio6.x with nv3D experimenter module available to funders via download estimated in September 2014.
Our capabilities:

nv3D (TM) display technology. Allow creation of new displays, or change current ones, to show NaturalVision3D (TM) content. 

nv3D image format - Enable the creation of images that will be seen on NaturalVision3D enabled devices. Add to your software or display firmware.

Real-time capture software, to broadcast locally or to internet client.
What will be available to people:In addition to products using the technology,  we're trying to plan the ability to create your own 3D ViewChannel, and provide free, or subscription based content to the world, through our ""RoomWithAView"" system. Broadcast view environments, exploration, adventure video, art and photography, science and educational content, that you can update whenever you wish.We won't think 
of everything, so if you have other uses that you would like us to enable and explore, drop us a line. imagine@eos-vision.com",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p></div>","We started Dick Moby because we wanted to address the plastic pollution of our oceans in a positive way. We both love the ocean. Growing up surfing and sailing we’ve experienced the plastic pollution first hand. 
Being both designers we are passionate about quality and sustainability. So we want to see if we can make something positive out of plastic and address the problem of plastic pollution at the same time. 
Over the past year, with the help of a lot of friends and the clever people at our production company and suppliers, we designed a beautiful collection of sunglasses, made out of a new bio-acetate. Wholesale priceWe offer our sunglasses for the wholesale price of €77 / $106 / £64. When our campaign succeeds the sunglasses will cost €135 / $185 / £112 in selected stores.Don't like it? Return it!We know the quality of our sunglasses and are sure you will love them but if for any reason you're not happy with them we will exchange any pair of Dick Moby sunglasses that you send back to us. And if necessary return your money. Because our margins are really tight we will have to charge you for the shipping costs.
We've teamed up with the Surfrider Foundation. And we are proud to announce that 10% of our revenue will be used on projects with them. Projects that will address the plastic pollution and help us find ways to create a bright future for plastic and for our oceans. 

The reason we wanted to work with the Surfrider Foundation is that we are surfers ourselves, and we wanted a partner that has experience and understands how we think. Because working with like minded people always gives better results.
So.. Look good, do good and join our movement! Check out the special color combination available; the Surfrider Foundation colab. 
Normal sunglasses are made from a regular acetate which is an oil based plastic. The product we use is M49, a new innovative bio-acetate produced from only renewable resources.Dick Moby is a ZEISS certified partner, which means that we get to use their premium line lenses. The best available; full UV protection, increased contrast and an anti scratch layer. You are going to love every second of looking through these lenses!  Personalise fit
Our sunglasses are made of a thermoplastic. This means that it’s possible to personalise the shape of the temples at your local opticien. 
Free shipping in the Netherlands. European shipping €8. UK shipping £6,6. US/CA shipping $22. AUS/NZ shipping $20. You have to include the shipping costs on top of your Indiegogo perk, since Indiegogo doesn't automatically do this. 
Please bare in mind that any import taxes for your country will be your responsibility.
We understand that choosing the right model can be difficult and we will do our best to exchange any pair of Dick Moby sunglasses that you send back to us. Because our margins are really tight we will have to charge you for the extra shipping costs.
We truly believe that quality and sustainability should go hand in hand, so we didn't want to create packaging you would just throw away. We came up with a beautiful packaging made out of thick and sturdy recycled cardboard, a soft inside and a magnetic seal so that it can be used as packaging by also as a protective hardcase. 
It's been an epic journey and after 10 months of hard work, high-fives, a lot of beer, a few whiskeys, laughs, some frustrations and trips to France, Italy and England the results are here! 
We started sketching and making the first cardboard prototypes in May 2013.
In September we’ve met up with some experienced eyewear designers from London, who helped us to bring our sketches into 3D models with the right dimensions and ergonomics to create the ultimate fit. We’ve visited factories and suppliers in November and by January we had worked out the deals with all of them. Everybody is waiting for the results of this campaign, so we can start production. Almost go time!Check our our progress photo album on Facebook.We absolutely love our sunglasses and we're sure you will too.
All designs are finished, the first prototypes have been made and we are in the last stages of tweaking the sunglasses to a perfect fit. We'll continue to fine tune the models during our campaign as well. No big changes, just some finishing detailsMetal DM initials on the inside of the temple tips
Small  ‘D’ and ‘M’ gold coloured metal plagues will be pressed in the acetate cover with lacquer. Only visible when you close your sunglasses. Smooth sailing.Time schedule 2014Indiegogo campaign (8 March - 20 April)Final round of prototypes, to tweak the last details (April)Start of production (April - May)Surprise packaging add-on!? (May)Expected delivery (June)
When you support us by ordering a pair of sunglasses, you’ll not only receive your shades this summer, but you will also be helping us realise our dream and supporting us and the Surfrider Foundation, in our mission to address the plastic pollution of our oceans.Break-evenOur break-even point to start production is €35.000 / $48.000 / £29.000. 
Your support will pay for necessary tooling costs and the start of production.
There are risks and challenges with every undertaking but in creating a product from scratch there are definitely a few. 
We know the drillOur personal and professional lives have seasoned us perfectly for this challenge. We both had businesses before, we know the drill! Tim has a background in graphic design and advertising and Robbert in fashion design. Combined we know what looks good and we have the knowledge to tackle design and development. 
Best of the bestTo make this project a succes we have searched and found the best factory and suppliers, we visited them all. We became ZEISS certified partner, and we’ve worked with eyewear experts from London to get the best possible pair of sunglasses. The design, fit, materials and production partner put our sunglasses on the same level as many of the A-brands out there, sometimes even higher. After testing our prototypes on all different shapes and types of faces we are confident that there is at least one fit perfect for you.
Delivery in June 2014While, as with anything, there can be surprises we feel confident that we can deliver this product on schedule in June 2014. In the lead up to delivery we will respond to all of your enquiries as promptly as possible, keep you up to date on our progress, and work as hard as we can to get you your pair of Dick Moby sunglasses as soon as possible.

Are the sunglasses made from recycled plastic?
No, we’ve put a lot of time into researching if we could use the plastic waste from our oceans to make the high quality sunglasses we envisioned. Unfortunately this wasn't possible. We still continue to research innovative ways of recycling with experienced companies like www.crem.nl and www.terracycle.com.What is eco friendly about the sunglasses?We use an innovative bio-acetate that is produced from renewable resources.

Can I return the sunglasses if I don't like them?
Yes, we understand that it’s possible that you pick the wrong pair from just seeing the photo's and measurements. We will be more than happy to send you any different model or colour in return. You do need to help us with the shipping costs. What happens when Dick Moby doesn't reach 500 supporters?We are going to work hard not to let that happen! 
But if it does, you will get your money back. 
What can you do to help?Of course getting one of our perks means the world to us! Also sharing our video and story with friends and family via social media would help us a lot. You can use the Indiegogo social sharing tools, its very easy.

<p>Hi, I'm Sally. Half of you are probably visiting straight from Facebook and know me already, but for those who are browsing Indiegogo with a tenner burning a hole in their paypal account that they're just dying to spend helping someone get their dream started, allow me to big myself up: </p>
<p>I'm a freelance all kinds of things; a pole dance and fitness instructor, a fire dancer, former media luvvie but my real passion is outdoor sports. I love snowboarding, rollerblading, SUP boarding, climbing and like to pretend I can skydive. While I'm new to this game, I have years of transferable experience in running a small business, networking and selling. </p>
<p>I've always aimed to align my true loves with my career - something that never runs smoothly but always makes for an interesting life! - but I'm really going for it here with my own range of extreme sports apparel. Nothing too technical initially, some cool t-shirts, vests and hoodies with hand drawn designs, am emphasis on comfort and easy wearability (not a word, according to the red squiggle, but you get what I mean) and working with models who are real surfers, skaters etc. and not just pretty faces. </p>
<p>I've had a pretty good start, with a rather funky raglan and a cute girly cropped vest in production as we speak and pre-orders coming in, but with a cash boost I can really increase the range and - perhaps more importantly - focus on some little branding details like additional labels and hang tags that really make the difference to the quality of the products.</p>
<p>I'm super-passionate about this, and even the smallest contribution would bring the smiles :) </p> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div>Every new design has a minimum order number from suppliers. This means it gets expensive very quickly to have anything like a decent range. Your contribution will help to increase the diversity of what we offer. More designs = more likely there's something for everyone = bigger business. </div><div>I'm also looking to invest a large part of what we raise here into branding. Additional labels, custom packaging, swing tags. These little touches are the things that really give a product quality when you get it in the mail.

<p>Hi everyone, my name is MJ. I’m passionate about sharing what I have learned in working with some of the most enlightened brands--particularly with college students, our future change-makers. In my 20 years of branding, marketing and communications work, I have been fortunate to work with companies and non-profits on issues of conservation, climate change, organics, sweatshops, autism, clean energy and many more 21st century challenges.</p>
<p>But I have never before been able to CREATE a product in the global economy where we live that demonstrates the best way to make it, and the most honest way to sell it. </p>
<p>Some call this authenticity. We think of it as having Integrity.</p>

<p>We set out to make something as basic as underwear, and to mark each step with integrity: the fabrics, the people who sew the product and the packaging. We want to use our model of business to inspire college students and consumers nationwide how to vote with their wallets by choosing products made with sustainable fabrics, fair labor and transparent marketing. Since 98% of apparel sold in the U.S. is made overseas, we have a LONG way to go toward understanding where these products come from and in improving how we make and market them. We thought we would start with the basics - underwear.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How TRU2U works with students &amp; organizations</strong></h2>
<p>We see the more than 45,000 college students in our town alone get excited when they learn about their role in the global economy and the impact they can have by investing their dollars in great products, fair labor and honest talk. This is what we call TRU - 2 U, your friends, your commmunity and your world. </p>

<h2><strong>TRU U</strong></h2>
<p>Because our products were inspired by students and are for students, we will carry out our TRU U program on campuses around the country (starting with the 5 colleges where we work and live), and then expand to other colleges where students can sell TRU2U underwear and dormwear to earn money for their social change organization. We call this our TRU U program and we believe it helps to incubate young change-makers, like the ones working in our office everyday in Amherst, Mass.</p>

<h2><strong>DESIGNED BY STUDENTS </strong></h2>
<p>Students will create limited edition designs, carry out social networking and take part in an active and vibrant business. In fact, TRU2U was inspired through student designers as a project at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. In keeping with that spirit, we believe that TRU2U can inspire change from within young people once they connect with the makers of their products and communicate more about these TRUfacts, helping more individuals be TRU2 themselves, their friends and family, their own community and to the global community from which we buy products everyday.</p>

<h2><em><strong>Value &amp; Benefit</strong></em></h2>
<h3><em><strong>Our Value Proposition:</strong></em></h3>
<p>Most neckwear that is comparable to ours in price range is made in quanitities of 1,000 plus per design/color.  Our <strong>competitors</strong> average limited edition necktie or bow tie is made in a product run of about 100 pieces per design/color and on average starts at<strong> $110 and up</strong>.</p>
<p>At <strong>Windsor Neckwear</strong> we offer all of our designs from our <strong><em>Platinum Collection</em></strong> in limited product runs of 25 pieces per design/color in high quality silk fabrics with an average of 114 picks.  Our limited edition neckwear is sold for <strong>$45</strong> to <strong>$65</strong> per tie/bow tie which is a fraction of our competitors cost with the same superior quality and construction. We feel that by doing this we offer superior quality at with extreme value for our customers.  Because of this our products tend to sell out very fast.</p>

<h2><strong><em>What happens if we get completely funded?</em></strong></h2>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>We already have all of the necessary neckwear manufacturing processes in place.  We have gone through the process of figuring out what designs are best, color schemes, materials to use and dimensions that offer the best look from big and tall to standard neckwear.  With a completely funded program we will be able to lower our overhead on neckwear and pass the savings on to our customers.</p>
<p><em><strong>Dress Socks</strong> </em>- We have built relationships with a very reputable dress sock manufacturer who is ready for us to submit our order to be produced in 8-10 weeks.  The socks will be made from 70% Cotton 30% Nylon Blend in several cool colors and patterns from stripe, argyle, paisley and patchwork.</p>

<p><em><strong>Sock Samples from the Walk In Comfort Collection</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Cufflinks</em></strong> - We have submitted designs and currently awaiting our samples for our custom designed cufflinks.  Windsor Neckwear has enlisted the support of a manufacturing facility that has over 25 years of cufflink making experience in stainless steel and sterling silver.  We plan to launch the collection with 10 beautiful designs sold in limited quantities of 50 per style.</p>

<h3>YOU DON'T ALWAYS NEED TO CHASE DREAMS: SOMETIMES, THEY CHASE YOU.</h3>
<div>It was late one night in 2003 - could it have been while deep in REM?- when I had an apparition of those shoes with a unique, slightly off-centre toe. That's right. Blurred as it may have been, this was a different toe shape, one I had never seen before: at the same time unusual but logical, as was the first toe to adapt itself to the shape of the foot. I committed the design to paper as soon as I awoke  the following day.</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/852104/files/20140912095633-boceto_hori.jpg?1410540993"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>More excited than apprehensive, one year later I found myself producing the first collection of Laetitia's. The brand worked well. I presented five collections over the course of three years, and then, well, a sixth for Charles Jourdan.                                     A great stroke of luck that was.</p>
<p>Happy with the results, in 2007 I decided to distance myself for a short while from the brand, to regain perspective and work through any improvements, but life took such a turn that I had to leave it completely behind. Today, seven years on, something tells me it is time to take it up again. Don't worry - I'm not going to get spiritual in anyone. Quite simply, there's just one question that has been nagging me all this time, one that has inevitably led me to ask others in turn:</p>
<p>When will Laetitia's be available again? When will Laetitia's be available again? When will Laetitia's be available again? If the demand is there, if people still miss them, why not give it a go? Why not give it another try? Why not try to give it my all to reach ever more feet, girls, parties? After all, the hard part - the sole - is already done.</p>
<h3>TO THE POINT.</h3>
<div>I need to raise 15.000€ to produce 300 pairs of Laetitia's in Alicante. 300 is not a random number: it is the minimum order to start (again). You won't find a factory willing to produce any less.</div>
<h3>THE PLAN.</h3>
<div>To relaunch Laetitia's selling 200 pairs at a special one-off price - mate's rates, wholesale price, reduced price, super bargain price, here, to whoever pre-purchases on Indiegogo, and <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">keep the remaining 100 to sell them at a normal RRP on my online store, which I will only be able to launch if fate, and yourselves, are by my side.</span>

Era 2003,
era de noche, ¿era fase Rem? cuando se me aparecieron estos zapatos de punta

Tranquil@, no es ningún rollo espiritual. Estoy aquí por una simple pregunta que me
ha estado persiguiendo todo este tiempo (¿Cuándo vuelven las Laetitia´s? ¿Cuándo vuelven las Laetitia's? ¿Cuándo vuelven las Laetitia's?) y que me ha llevado, inevitablemente, a

Si hay demanda, si se echan de menos, si el tiempo ha demostrado que son atemporales, ¿por qué no intentarlo? Si se volverían a comprar, si hay agua en la piscina, ¿por qué no lanzarme?, ¿por qué no apostar para que lleguen a más pies, a más chicas,
a más fiestas? Después de todo, lo más difícil (la horma) ya está hecho.

¿Por qué la entrega no es hasta enero? Es el plazo que me ha dado la fábrica. La campaña termina a finales de octubre y tardan 2 meses en fabricarlos, uno a uno.
¿Estilizan tanto el pie como en las fotos? Estilizan tanto el pie como en las fotos.
¿Cuánto me ahorro si las compro durante esta campaña? Alrededor de un 60%, una ganga, una bicoca.
¿Son de piel? Son de piel: de napa, ante y tafilete. La apariencia de piel exótica es un grabado sobre el cuero. Las que brillan son laminadas (oro, azul) y el ""glitter"" es una tela.
¿La piel cede? No siempre. Pero en el caso de ceder, lo hará sólo de ancho, nunca de largo.
¿Se fabrican en Alicante de verdad? Sí, concretamente en Elda.
¿Puedo donar dinero extra? Cómo negarme.
¿Si conseguido el objetivo no me quedan bien podré devolverlas? Ojalá pudieras, pero sentimos decirte que esto no es una tienda, es una apuesta, no existen las devoluciones.

ENGLISH VERSION

YOU DON'T ALWAYS NEED TO CHASE DREAMS: SOMETIMES, THEY CHASE YOU.
It was late one night in 2003 - could it have been while deep in REM?- when I had an apparition of those shoes with a unique, slightly off-centre toe. That's right. Blurred as it may have been, this was a different toe shape, one I had never seen before: at the same time unusual but logical, as was the first toe to adapt itself to the shape of the foot. I committed the design to paper as soon as I awoke  the following day.

More excited than apprehensive, one year later I found myself producing the first collection of Laetitia's. The brand worked well. I presented five collections over the course of three years, and then, well, a sixth for Charles Jourdan.                                     A great stroke of luck that was.
Happy with the results, in 2007 I decided to distance myself for a short while from the brand, to regain perspective and work through any improvements, but life took such a turn that I had to leave it completely behind. Today, seven years on, something tells me it is time to take it up again. Don't worry - I'm not going to get spiritual in anyone. Quite simply, there's just one question that has been nagging me all this time, one that has inevitably led me to ask others in turn:
When will Laetitia's be available again? When will Laetitia's be available again? When will Laetitia's be available again? If the demand is there, if people still miss them, why not give it a go? Why not give it another try? Why not try to give it my all to reach ever more feet, girls, parties? After all, the hard part - the sole - is already done.
TO THE POINT.
I need to raise 15.000€ to produce 300 pairs of Laetitia's in Alicante. 300 is not a random number: it is the minimum order to start (again). You won't find a factory willing to produce any less.
THE PLAN.
To relaunch Laetitia's selling 200 pairs at a special one-off price - mate's rates, wholesale price, reduced price, super bargain price, here, to whoever pre-purchases on Indiegogo, and keep the remaining 100 to sell them at a normal RRP on my online store, which I will only be able to launch if fate, and yourselves, are by my side.

The founders, Teague Egan and Sterling Brewster, are both very passionate, avid sports fans. From Ft. Lauderdale and San Diego respectively, the two met at the University of Southern California. During this time the Trojan football team was in steady decline from being a perennial national championship contender. ""We just weren't big enough, not strong enough, not fast enough,"" explains Sterling. The two put their heads together to try and solve this problem of performance on the field, specifically fatigue.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">“We wanted to get into sports apparel, but needed to figure out how to differentiate ourselves from companies like Nike and Under Armour,” said Teague.“They have products that help keep you warm, or cool, get rid of sweat and odor, or even monitor your performance. Well that’s great, but what do athletes really need? Something that actually IMPROVES performance, and makes you BETTER.”</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Research was conducted and one of the leading factors causing fatigue is a lack of oxygen to the muscle tissue. “We then found out that there are certain minerals and compounds out there that can capture heat, reflect light, and absorb this infrared energy. These minerals also have an amazing effect on the capillaries do wonders to increase blood flow,” explains Sterling.“I then went to my dad who is a cardiovascular surgeon because he's an expert when it comes to blood flow, science, etc, and he validated the claim.”</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">With the goal of maximizing this oxygen in the body, and helping player performance, 1st Round Athletics was born.  We then went on to find a 3rd party research lab that had been working on the technology for about 10 years. Focusing on the medical market, specifically diabetics because of the increased blood flow properties our technology possesses, we partnered with them to bring energyDNA® to the athletic market.</span></p><p><b>WHAT IT IS &amp; HOW IT WORKS</b></p><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/PVG37WO_cbq8oPFMBcav1Oj6wnrlPHLtDR8R-7fN3E-1-9L3ltTZgPCgLv0A18nwRVLdNltC8-Uc0cwg2TbWtYoSUCyALB0_AV08SzALEqgXm02DN6Dki_JCZqoeSIwJzk4b_Xn9UEboSqprmQdFokG2ZJElmko6TG8W=s0-d-e1-ft#https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/001/610/738/defef20950394d2d88030b526f6f0430_large.png?1391825391"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>THE PROBLEM: WE'RE ALWAYS LOSING ENERGY.</b></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Over 60% of the energy we consume is lost to escaping body heat.

The textile industry is rapidly changing and energyDNA® is at the forefront of this revolution. Not only do we aim to change the landscape of the sports industry, but this will also promote health and exercise throughout the world, and hopefully improve people's lifestyle. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">From the beginning we were very well funded. Then when we were able to raise a round of seed funding from outside investors, this was very encouraging for us, and one of the driving forces to continue this venture. We know we have a tremendous product, but we needed people outside the company to confirm our beliefs. Having our investors believe in the technology and product has given us the ability to get to this point. Through all the designing, research, and development, we are finally ready to go into production. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">EnergyDNA® is the future of fiber technology.

Yes, these guys want to do it all.""""...One USC Student's Path To Building The Next Nike.""OUR STORY1st Round Athletics is an athletic apparel company based in Los Angeles, California. The founders, Teague Egan and Sterling Brewster, are both very passionate, avid sports fans. From Ft. Lauderdale and San Diego respectively, the two met at the University of Southern California. During this time the Trojan football team was in steady decline from being a perennial national championship contender. ""We just weren't big enough, not strong enough, not fast enough,"" explains Sterling. The two put their heads together to try and solve this problem of performance on the field, specifically fatigue.“We wanted to get into sports apparel, but needed to figure out how to differentiate ourselves from companies like Nike and Under Armour,” said Teague.“They have products that help keep you warm, or cool, get rid of sweat and odor, or even monitor your performance. Well that’s great, but what do athletes really need? Something that actually IMPROVES performance, and makes you BETTER.”Research was conducted and one of the leading factors causing fatigue is a lack of oxygen to the muscle tissue. “We then found out that there are certain minerals and compounds out there that can capture heat, reflect light, and absorb this infrared energy. These minerals also have an amazing effect on the capillaries do wonders to increase blood flow,” explains Sterling.“I then went to my dad who is a cardiovascular surgeon because he's an expert when it comes to blood flow, science, etc, and he validated the claim.”With the goal of maximizing this oxygen in the body, and helping player performance, 1st Round Athletics was born.  We then went on to find a 3rd party research lab that had been working on the technology for about 10 years. Focusing on the medical market, specifically diabetics because of the increased blood flow properties our technology possesses, we partnered with them to bring energyDNA® to the athletic market.WHAT IT IS & HOW IT WORKSTHE PROBLEM: WE'RE ALWAYS LOSING ENERGY.Over 60% of the energy we consume is lost to escaping body heat. Imagine if turning on the heater in your car burned through more than half of your gasoline. At the low end your body produces approximately 100 watts of energy in a sitting state, that's enough to power a light bulb. At the opposite end of the spectrum, during a full court game of basketball your body burns through over 1,100 watts of energy. To put that into perspective, that's enough energy to power your laptop for 20 hours. THE SOLUTION: energyDNA®Our energyDNA® yarn constructed with Celliant® master batch converts your body heat into reusable energy by reflecting, absorbing, and recycling the energy back to the body increasing oxygen delivery to the muscles. This enables users to fight fatigue and increase performance. WHY IT'S THE BESTEnergyDNA® is the first technology to deliver clinically proven performance benefits to the user.FEATURESATHLETE USE CASESRight now we only have the capacity to deliver our gear with energyDNA® technology to select athletes from the NFL, NBA, MLB, and Olympic Team USA. These athletes have had the chance to train in it, and the feedback has been amazing. Both Jordan Campbell, linebacker for the Kansas City Chiefs, and Shawn Crawford, an Olympic gold medalist sprinter, are fully endorsed by 1st Round. “Every advantage you can get is worth it,” said Crawford. “EnergyDNA® gives me that advantage for me to be the best in the world. It’s apparel that gives back. If you don’t get with the program, you’re going to be left behind.”.Jordan has been wearing energyDNA® during his offseason training program, ""After wearing 1st Round energyDNA® for the past 6 weeks I can't believe how much my performance has increased. I've become stronger, faster, and more explosive.""The company has supplied gear to over 60 other professional athletes, including NFL Pro-Bowlers, NBA All-Stars, #1 Ranked Boxers, and many more.  We need your help to make this amazing technology available to the masses. REWARDS*Please note that we have added and will be adding new rewards such as friends and family, and lifetime discount codes to the actual perks section along the top righthand side throughout the campaign.

I was just starting to establish my brand when I was laid off from Abercrombie, and am struggling to continue to develop and grow my brand. 
My goal is to take the wedding gown line I have designed and manufacture and wholesale it to boutiques. 
I believe my designs are one of a kind and have a unique place in the bridal market. I want to combine my knowledge and experience in the industry and utilize them to create a luxurious line of wedding gowns that offer brides a chance to feel special and unique. 
I will design and manufacture the line using a manufacturer that I know and trust, so I can personally oversee the process and ensure I am delivering the best quality gowns. 
With your help we can make Cierra Lauren a brand all brides love. 
Thank you so much for your support!

<p><b>Witticist®</b> is a <b>trademarked entertainment company</b>, <b>launched in 2013</b>, providing humorous news, videos, parodies and more. </p>
<p>People always look for a way to escape the harsh realities of life. We try to escape because we need a place to go that isn’t in an office, in a cubicle, at work, or school. We seek enjoyment, laughter, and solace. We read the news every day, and realize the terrible things that constantly go on!</p>
<p><b>Witticists</b>—a term coined by our company—choose to find humor in life, and envision a world filled with comedy, and in today’s society, we’re so caught up in the news, or our crazy, hectic lives, that we most often forget how funny life is! </p>
<p><b>We are looking to expand Witticist® into a clothing brand, to create comedic apparel meant to inspire laughter. </b></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3>
<div>
<p>We are seeking $500 to place an order of 100 T-shirts with a Witticist® logo. We will then sell each shirt for $20 to raise a total of $2,000 pre-shipping. From there, we will use that $2,000 to develop 4 separate t-shirt lines, with slogans proposed and voted on by audiences across the United States. </p>
<p><b>Our Strategy is as follows:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Raise $500 via IndieGoGo to order 100 t-shirts.</li>
<li>Sell the t-shirts at $20 a piece in order to raise around $2,000.</li>
<li>With the $2,000, we will develop four separate slogans, which will be proposed and voted on by audiences across the United States. We will order 100 t-shirts for each slogan, totaling 400 shirts. This will, in turn, begin the expansion of the brand.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are setting our campaign goal low, at only $500, because we firmly believe that through proper management, we can turn a small investment into a larger one. As our clothing line expands, we will be able to dedicate revenue to advertising the core of the Witticist® brand, <a href=""http://witticist.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Witticist.com</a>, and from there, increase our audience and customer base.</p>
</div>
<h3>What You Get</h3> <p>We offer multiple rewards for you support! For instance: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Placing you on our Donor's Page at <a href=""http://witticist.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Witticist.com</a>.</li>
<li>A personal thank you via phone from a Witticist® staff member.</li>
<li>A cartoon caricature of yourself, similar to all Witticist® employees.</li>
<li>A limited edition (1/100) t-shirt from the first order ever placed.</li>
<li>And much, much more!</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We spend most of our time working, fretting, and then...working more. The sad truth is that the cycle will never change. But the introduction of a Witticist® brand, featuring humorous slogans on t-shirts, will aim to brighten the days of those around us.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>We are setting our campaign goal low, at only $500, because we firmly believe that through proper management, we can turn a small investment into a larger one. Instead of asking for $2,000, to purchase four separate lines of shirts, we are starting small, with $500.

Witticist® is a trademarked entertainment company, launched in 2013, providing humorous news, videos, parodies and more. 
People always look for a way to escape the harsh realities of life. We try to escape because we need a place to go that isn’t in an office, in a cubicle, at work, or school. We seek enjoyment, laughter, and solace. We read the news every day, and realize the terrible things that constantly go on!
Witticists—a term coined by our company—choose to find humor in life, and envision a world filled with comedy, and in today’s society, we’re so caught up in the news, or our crazy, hectic lives, that we most often forget how funny life is! 
We are looking to expand Witticist® into a clothing brand, to create comedic apparel meant to inspire laughter. 
   What We Need 

We are seeking $500 to place an order of 100 T-shirts with a Witticist® logo. We will then sell each shirt for $20 to raise a total of $2,000 pre-shipping. From there, we will use that $2,000 to develop 4 separate t-shirt lines, with slogans proposed and voted on by audiences across the United States. 
Our Strategy is as follows:

Raise $500 via IndieGoGo to order 100 t-shirts.
Sell the t-shirts at $20 a piece in order to raise around $2,000.
With the $2,000, we will develop four separate slogans, which will be proposed and voted on by audiences across the United States. We will order 100 t-shirts for each slogan, totaling 400 shirts. This will, in turn, begin the expansion of the brand.

We are setting our campaign goal low, at only $500, because we firmly believe that through proper management, we can turn a small investment into a larger one. As our clothing line expands, we will be able to dedicate revenue to advertising the core of the Witticist® brand, Witticist.com, and from there, increase our audience and customer base.

What You Get We offer multiple rewards for you support! For instance: 


Placing you on our Donor's Page at Witticist.com.
A personal thank you via phone from a Witticist® staff member.
A cartoon caricature of yourself, similar to all Witticist® employees.
A limited edition (1/100) t-shirt from the first order ever placed.
And much, much more!


  The Impact We spend most of our time working, fretting, and then...working more. The sad truth is that the cycle will never change. But the introduction of a Witticist® brand, featuring humorous slogans on t-shirts, will aim to brighten the days of those around us.

  Risks & Challenges  We are setting our campaign goal low, at only $500, because we firmly believe that through proper management, we can turn a small investment into a larger one. Instead of asking for $2,000, to purchase four separate lines of shirts, we are starting small, with $500. From the revenue of each shirt, we will purchase more items, advertising, etc. As our clothing line expands, we will be able to dedicate revenue to advertising the core of the Witticist brand, Witticist.com, and from there, increase our audience and customer base. By starting small, we minimize risk. Our sole challenge will be devoting our revenue from ads on our website to advertise the clothing.   Other Ways You Can Help Witticist®

<h3>About Pixie In The Park &amp; Our Campaign</h3>
<p>My name is Paisley and I own a small ethical fashion label,<a href=""www.pixieinthepark.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Pixie In The Park</a>, based in Australia. The label aims to use all organic and sustainable materials. This year we want to release a range of the most comfortable leggings made in Australia. The fabric that will be used is 95% organic cotton and 5% elastemetric (spandex). We have done extensive testing with the 100% cotton as this was our original preference, but it did not retain its shape and you tended to get left with baggy knees by the end of the day. </p>
<p>The design and pattern are drafted and we have been doing testing on the prototypes and have great feedback so far. They will be available from size Au 4 - Au 18 with custom sizes available. </p>
<p>We are here because we need your help to purchase the 100% organic cotton thread for this new range. </p>
<p>The fabric we buy is made in Australia and our labels are printed in Melbourne. All garments are ethically made in Australia. <span><br/></span></p>

<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Currently we pay $44 per spool for 100% organic cotton thread (standard polycotton of the same size retails for $6). We need 7 spools of black and 7 spools of white totalling: $616.

There will be an opportunity for two lucky sponsors to name a range. <span><br/></span></p>

Though this has long included clock dials, its use in a miniaturized form for wristwatches is fairly new.Marquetry is a technique that requires intense planning and precision. Based on a drawing, our artisan first created a simplified line drawing that would allow him to outline each piece of the puzzle and then saw the veneer in stacked layers. He then reassembled the tiny pieces on the dial before polishing it to achieve the final finish. All our watches are assembled with a Swiss movement (Ronda) by a French watchmaker based in the small town of Morteau, that has a long track record of creating reliable and precise timepieces.Our straps are handmade in Besançon, France.We use vegetable tanning, a traditional method refined during the Renaissance for the leather of our straps. As it is more time-consuming to produce and heavily relies on experienced craftsmen to create the vegetable-tanned leather, only 10% of leather world production is made using this natural process.In order to offer you timepieces that will last a lifetime, we use high quality components. We are so confident of the quality, that all our watches are covered with a 10 years warranty.KOPPO's story has began with the collection Originelle, inspired by the mountains of Jura, our passion for wood and the savoir-faire of our craftsmen.The Harmony collection embodies the sober and harmonious fusion of two veneers, assembled by hand.The Métiers d'Arts collection highlights the know-how of local artisans with a modern reinterpretation of wood marquetry. Inspired by the beauty of nature, this collection brings together ancestral arts of watchmaking and wood marquetry.Change your strap easily – no tools needed.All our watches are made to last, we offer a 10 years warranty!

Nos collections s’inspirent des montagnes du Jura, berceau de l’horlogerie, à la frontière de la France et de la Suisse. “Intemporel, simplicité, beauté de la nature ”Pour donner vie à nos montres durables, nous nous sommes entourés des meilleurs artisans autour de chez nous, dans les montagnes du Jura. Passionnés par leur métier et à la recherche de la qualité absolue, nous sommes fiers de mettre en avant nos partenaires et ainsi pérenniser la tradition de leur savoir-faire.Depuis des siècles, la marqueterie a été principalement utilisée pour la décoration de meubles en bois. Cette technique ancestrale est cependant très innovante dans le monde de l'horlogerie. Nous travaillons avec un artisan marqueteur expert dans la conception de petites pièces artistiques dans un petit village du Doubs.La marqueterie est une technique qui demande en amont une grande préparation et une extrême précision dans la réalisation. Notre artisan crée d’abord un dessin simplifié qui s’apparente à un puzzle où il trace les contours de chaque essence de bois qui formera le visuel définitif. Il découpe chaque petite pièce dans des plaquages de bois, les rassemble sur le cadran puis les polit pour laisser apparaître le motif choisi.Toutes nos montres sont équipées d’un mouvement Suisse Ronda et assemblées avec soin par un horloger dans la ville de Morteau. Notre partenaire horloger est connu depuis longtemps pour la conception de garde-temps précis et haut de gamme.Nos bracelets sont réalisés à la main par notre artisan à Besançon en France. Nous utilisons un tannage naturel, une méthode traditionnelle utilisée depuis la Renaissance. Le cuir est nourri aux huiles et cires naturelles, il est peu couvert pour garder un aspect très naturel. Le bracelet va se patiner avec le temps, le rendant unique, garanti d’une exceptionnelle qualité. Seulement 10% de la production mondiale de cuir est tanné naturellement car c’est un procédé long qui requiert une grande expérience artisanale.Pour concevoir notre montre durable, nous utilisons les matériaux les plus nobles et les composants de la meilleure qualité. Toutes nos montres ont une garantie de 10 ans car nous les avons conçues pour qu’elles durent dans le temps et soient réparables.Parce que tout est parti de là… des montagnes du Jura, de l’amour du bois et du savoir-faire de nos artisans.Tout en harmonie et sobriété, la rencontre de deux essences de bois.Éloge de la main et du savoir-faire de l’artisan avec la réinterprétation contemporaine de la marqueterie. Inspirée par la beauté de la nature, la collection Métier d’Arts réunit la tradition de l’horlogerie et l’art de marqueterie sur bois.Un bracelet très facilement interchangeable grâce à son bouton poussoir – pas besoin d’outil.Toutes nos montres sont créées pour durer, nous offrons une garantie de 10 ans !

<h1><b>How it’s made; SilverTech </b></h1>
<p>Organic Basics is very focused on creating a sustainable alternative to fast fashion and therefore our rules are no nasty chemicals and no nanotechnology. We’ve partnered with a world leading smart fiber company based in Europe, that uses natural silver to prevent bacterial growth on fabrics. Their proprietary process completely covers advanced fibers with silver while allowing them to remain extremely soft, flexible and comfortable.

<h1><b>Sustainability, I like that. </b></h1>
<p>The fashion industry is the second most polluting industry on a global scale. 40% of the environmental impact is happening in the consumption phase due to washing and drying. In Organic Basics we want to bring this massive water and energy consumption down. Sustainability is the cornerstone of Organic Basics and our line of SilverTech products was created to minimise the need for washing and thereby bring down the water and energy consumption on a larger scale. The SilverTech fabric is produced under the EPA and REACH act and our suppliers are Oekto-Tex and GOTS certified which means that it meets the highest standard of social and environmental sustainability standards. That's good for you, the farmer, the factory worker and the environment.</p>

<h1><b>Care Instructions, because we care. </b></h1>
<p>We recommend washing your SilverTech products every 10-14 days with your normal laundry. Yes, SilverTech keeps bacteria from multiplying on the fabric but dust and dead skin-cells will eventually accumulate. Wash it on a cool (30 degree celsius) or warm cycle (40 degree celsius), and hang to dry if possible. The SilverTech products will be able to take up to 60 degree celsius and can be tumble dried on low heat however we do not recommend this due to unnecessary use of energy. Do not use chlorine bleach.</p>

</div><div><div> </div></div></div>","In simple Danish design and incredibly soft organic cotton, our basics are developed with some of the most technologically advanced silver fibers in the world. The SilverTech fibers prevent growth of unwanted bacteria - without losing any effect, even after hundreds of washes. We have autonomous driving cars and speaking robots but we are still wearing the same basic clothing we did 100 years ago. We think it’s time to change that and bring smart fibers into our everyday clothing. Let’s not waste our precious personal time or mother earth's resources, when the solution is right in front of us. 
ANTIMICROBIAL SILVERTECH
By fusing innovative fibers with natural silver, our fabric is 99.9% effective in preventing bacterial growth on the fabric surface.PERMANENTLY INFUSEDSimilar products wash out or degrade in strength over time. However, because the silver is woven directly into our fabric, it will never wash away. ORGANIC SOFTNESSWe’ve paired our technology with long staple organic cotton grown in Europe. Our GOTS certified organic cotton is among the softest, most durable cotton in the world. NO NASTY CHEMICALS. NO NANO PARTICLESSimilar products use harsh chemical treatments to adhere silver particles to fabrics. We use the real thing – 99% pure natural silver. LONG TERM SUSTAINABLESilverTech permanent odor control stops the growth of odor-causing bacteria on fabrics, so you can wear more and wash less. This helps save water, energy and greenhouse gas emissions on a large scale.Pure Silver? Sounds techy. In fact it is quite techy. Silver is naturally oligodynamic – meaning it prevents the growth of bacteria. Our fibers are woven with natural silver, this way, these antimicrobial properties are permanently integrated in the organic cotton. Active only on the fabric surface, SilverTech does not interfere with perspiration or with the skin’s natural bacterial flora. Clothing and other textile-based, SilverTech products are safe to use next to the skin. SilverTech particles are more than 100 times larger than nanoparticles and therefore are too large to penetrate the skin’s barrier.A new generation of underwear, much appreciated.For ages, the fabric we put right next to our skin has remained unchanged. We think it’s time to change that. We are constantly seeking new ways to use the world’s smartest natural materials. After years of research, we harnessed the incredible benefits of natural silver to create an innovative fabric that will disrupt and create a whole new category of smart fabric underwear. Silver, really? Silver has historically been used for it’s antimicrobial properties in hundreds, even thousands of years, from the ancient greek, where people would put silver coins in their water, to early warfare where wounded soldiers would use coins under their bandages. This technology has been verified by more than a decade of testing at global research institutions and compliant with the EPA and Reach act. Furthermore, Our fabric is put through rigorous wash tests to ensure protection that will last the lifetime of the product. Great. But is it comfy? Our advanced SilverTech fibers and long staple organic cotton come together to create a perfected skin feel. Underwear is our second skin and if it's not amazing to wear then it's no good. 100 percent of our GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) cotton is grown in Turkey, Europe. Turkey is among the world's oldest organic cotton manufacturers. The Turkish organic crops and methods has been perfected for decades and are among the world's leading organic cotton manufacturers in creating super soft and durable organic cotton fibers.Perfect, can you help me get the right size?One thing is a super soft fabric, but just as important is the fit. We’ve worked with professional textile engineers and designers to get the best fit. Use the size guide below to find the best fit for you.       

How it’s made; SilverTech 
Organic Basics is very focused on creating a sustainable alternative to fast fashion and therefore our rules are no nasty chemicals and no nanotechnology. We’ve partnered with a world leading smart fiber company based in Europe, that uses natural silver to prevent bacterial growth on fabrics. Their proprietary process completely covers advanced fibers with silver while allowing them to remain extremely soft, flexible and comfortable. Only very small amounts of silver are required for SilverTech products for them to achieve highly effective odor control performance. For example, 5,000 garments require the same amount of silver as one or two silver rings.

Sustainability, I like that. 
The fashion industry is the second most polluting industry on a global scale. 40% of the environmental impact is happening in the consumption phase due to washing and drying.

PROTOS was designed and eventually perfected through multiple prototypes and rigorous testing.</p><p>PROTOS is partnered with proven, reliable manufacturers experienced in watchmaking in China, Hong Kong and Japan. Each was selected following extensive research and tough trial and error periods, only becoming a partner after meeting strict prototype criteria and quality control.

A grail watch we can all afford. SPECIFICATIONSCASE SIZE: 40mm Diameter, 15.4mm Height (including case back and crystal), 20mm Lug Width, 47mm Lug-to-Lug  CASE MATERIAL: 316L Marine Grade Stainless Steel, Matte Brushed with Polished Sides, Solid Steel Case Back  DIAL: Matte Black, Applied Maxi Hour Markers, Yellow Metal Surrounds, Hand Applied LumeHANDS: Maxi Mercedes Hands, Yellow Metal Surrounds, Hand Applied Lume  CRYSTAL: Domed Sapphire, AR Coating on Inside  CROWN: 8mm Big Crown with Embossed Logo  BEZEL: Black Gloss Ceramic with Red Triangle and Lume Pip at 12, Indented White Indices, Uni-Directional   LUME: Swiss C3 SuperLuminova on Hands and Hour Markings and Bezel Pip  WATER RESISTANCE: Tested to 1000 ft / 300 Meters / 30 AtmospheresMOVEMENT: NH35a Japanese Movement by Seiko  BRACELET: 316L Stainless Steel Oyster Style (20mm tapered to 16mm), Matte Brushed Finish, Polished Solid End Links, Double Locking Safety Clasp with Debossed Logo AUTOMATIC MOVEMENT – SEIKO CALIBRE NH35A  At the heart of PROTOS is the Seiko manufactured NH35A Automatic Movement. Thoroughly tested and proven as extremely reliable, the NH35A has 24 jewels, beats at 21,600 bph and has 41 hours power reserve. The most up to date of the 3 most widely used micro brand movements (the others being the Swiss ETA 2824 and Miyota 9015 movements), the NH35a is from the family of robust, reliable movements made famous by Seiko over decades. Unlike the in-house movements of many Swiss 'luxury' manufacturers, the Japanese NH35A will demand little (if any), maintenance for the lifetime of your watch, ensuring years of accurate, reliable service. CERAMIC BEZEL  In recent years many luxury watch brands have made the shift from aluminium to ceramic bezels. Engineered ceramic, as used in watch making, has the benefit of being lightweight yet extremely hard, and does not age like other materials when exposed to salt water. Four times harder than stainless steel, ceramic bezels will not scratch or fade, preserving the pristine look of PROTOS for years to come and placing PROTOS in the same class as many high end luxury divers. DOMED SAPPHIRE CRYSTAL   ​Paying homage to the original Milsub divers of the 1950’s and 60’s, PROTOS has a domed sapphire crystal with anti-reflective coating on the inside. This is functional as well as aesthetic, providing less reflection and improved readability under water. Domed crystals were traditionally used to withstand high pressures at depth. 316L MARINE GRADE STAINLESS STEEL CASE AND BRACELET The preferred steel for use in harsh marine environments and widely used in diving (and surgical), equipment due to its properties, 316L stainless steel is the industry standard for extreme corrosion resistance, and is essentially unaffected by seawater. Both the case and bracelet have a brushed matte finish, with polished case sides and end links, for a stunning contrast on the wrist. C3 SUPERLUMINOVA  Manufactured in Switzerland, the SuperLuminova brand supplies lume to many of the world’s leading watch brands. C3 is their strongest grade, ensuring a bright and even glow. PROTOS uses C3 SuperLuminova mixed with a specific Pantone colour formula which gives it a vintage patina appearance in natural light, without comprising on the powerful and lasting green luminescence for functionality. 8MM BIG CROWN  Another design tribute to both the form and function of original dive watches of the 1950’s, the Big Crown is both easy to adjust (even on the wrist) and nostalgic in its appeal. Nearly all modern dive watches feature crown guards. PROTOS does not, and like the vintage watches on which it is based, looks way cooler as a result.    DIRECT TO CONSUMER MODELIts 2016. We are all well aware that we can achieve a much lower retail price point on high quality watches by adopting a direct to consumer model. With no large overheads for bricks & mortar retail space, no sub-distributor mark ups, no huge marketing budgets and other traditional costs, your PROTOS watch ships directly from us to your door at the best possible price point.  BACKGROUND  My mantra throughout this process has been: “Create a watch I would be excited to own. Make the quality the very best it can be for the price, and keep it affordable.” This project started a while back as a day-dream, pouring over online watch forums and researching the history of mechanical dive watches, from the first water-resistant Rolex Submariner’s of the 1950’s and Blancpains' early divers, through to Doxa and Seiko’s legendary tool watches of the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s. It became apparent that I was not alone in my appreciation, desire and enthusiasm for these watches but the cost to obtain an original vintage Submariner dive watch was often out of reach for most watch lovers. That’s when I decided I would make a version of my own: conceiving what would be the ideal divers homage watch. PROTOS was designed and eventually perfected through multiple prototypes and rigorous testing.PROTOS is partnered with proven, reliable manufacturers experienced in watchmaking in China, Hong Kong and Japan. Each was selected following extensive research and tough trial and error periods, only becoming a partner after meeting strict prototype criteria and quality control. They all operate under strict internationally accepted QA guidelines as they primarily export to EU and US markets. This is reflected in the 12 months warranty PROTOS provides with every watch.NOW SHIPPING  Thanks to our Early Backers  - We have been successfully funded, with manufacturing and testing now complete. Protos watches are currently in stock and ready to ship.",17.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Although it is true that you need to apply a considerable force in order to attach the buckle to the strap the first time, it can be done. As for taking it off, in a couple of minutes you will learn how to do it: try to think how it works. You need to tighten further around your waist while pressing outwards the notch in the buckle at the same time. You will feel the tension has been released so then, without releasing the notch in the buckle, just slide the belt outside of the buckle. Really a fantastic product and the quality of the leather is superb. Nice work!' </p><p>Kickstarter, Backer No: #6283, Ben Langers , Comment:</p><p> 'I haven't gone a day without my new belt since I got it delivered. Just ordered two more.

    We are Harmattan Design (Holt Evans & Radu Zarnescu), Kickstarter veterans and Enthusiastic Creators. Last year, our fourth campaign The Smart Belt 1.0 became the most funded fashion accessory in history.We sent out all the pledges and wanted to know what our backers had to say. To our delight, 67% of our backers wanted more colors for their belts, more buckle finishes and many had other even more interesting ideas of what we can improve.     So, on popular demand, this year, we are back and better, TAKE A LOOK!  What we believe is that there is no one thing that made our SMART BELT such a huge success, but the combination of all our innovations bundled into a nice and elegant, finely tuned package.  Firstly, replacing the 5 hole system with 32 adjustments brings a world of comfort and a whole new dimension of adjustability. Not many people think about it or realize it but, our waist changes as we go about our business throughout the day while the belt we wear does not adjust because holes are too far apart. Forget feeling tight or loose, you'll forget you have a belt on but your pants will stay exactly where they're supposed to.Our Kevlar® Core is our staple innovation. Belts wear out because the leather flexes longitudinally and loses structure. Our Kevlar® Core prevents that from happening by reinforcing the whole structure like nothing else. It makes the whole thing indestructible yet light and comfortable.   The Leather we use is the most exclusive leather anywhere in the world. Vegetable Tanning is almost a lost art. Because it takes longer to tan the leather with natural tannins it has been replaced by chromium tanning at the turn of the century. We get our leather from a small valley in Tuscany, Italy, one of the hand-full of places in the world where this is still done. It's much more resilient that normal leather, it's all natural, eco friendly and really smells good too. It will come with a certificate of authenticity and a serial number. Have you ever had a problem with a wrong size or buying a present for someone, ever been in between sizes? Not our Smart Belt 2.0. You will get to make your own size, so no chance of getting it wrong.  This was one of the biggest asks we got from our Backers, more colors and more buckles. And we don't disappoint our backers, we exist as a company because of them. After you pledge by selecting a reward from the column on the right and after the campaign ends in late July, we will send you a survey by e-mail where you can select options.




   HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGES > CLICK HERE   On the experience of a Super Project last year, The Smart Belt 1.0 with 15.000 backers in which we were 40 days late in starting to ship, we learned our lesson. This time, we are manufacturing beforehand and using a bit of stock as a buffer for any hurdle we might encounter. We will start shipping in August and fulfil in order of backer number at a rate of about 4000 backers per month with a better courier service this time.  “DuPontTM and Kevlar® are trademarks or registered trademarks of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company.""We welcome third party sharing of our product in graphic form and text but only if in accordance and in full respect of trademark and copyright use guidelines concerning Kevlar® issued by it's respective owner, E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company.For more information on using these trademarks linked to the materials we use in manufacturing THE SMART BELT 2.0, please visit:  Kevlar® Trademark PolicyWe, Harmattan Design LLC, are a responsible company and believe that quality is of the utmost importance.

As for taking it off, in a couple of minutes you will learn how to do it: try to think how it works. You need to tighten further around your waist while pressing outwards the notch in the buckle at the same time. You will feel the tension has been released so then, without releasing the notch in the buckle, just slide the belt outside of the buckle. Really a fantastic product and the quality of the leather is superb. Nice work!' Kickstarter, Backer No: #6283, Ben Langers , Comment: 'I haven't gone a day without my new belt since I got it delivered. Just ordered two more.

The thought, detail and passion that went into the design of the GX1-A is what makes this watch stand out.

  


  


Time should only be handcrafted by passion.  The LIV GX1-A is assembled in Switzerland, infusing the watch with a sense of history and tradition known for unrivaled quality and precision.


Each component in this watch is crafted with extreme care and workmanship.


  


Meticulous detail has gone into every step of the manufacturing process. With the ultimate goal of creating a superior quality timepiece.

  




Dimensions:



Case diameter: 42 mm (47.2 mm with crown)

Case thickness: 11.6 mm

Total watch length, including strap: 254 mm

Strap width at the lugs: 22 mm

Strap width at the pinhole: 19 mm

Buckle width: 23.8 mm

Watch weight: 100-105 grams (depending on the strap chosen)



  


Go Swiss or go home. Sure there are plenty of cheaper Chinese and Japanese movements, but not for us! The LIV GX1-A Swiss Automatic Watch features the accurate Sellita SW200 Swiss Movement.

Movement specifications:


Frequency: 28'800 A/h (4 Hz)

Running time: 38 hours

Number of jewels: 26

Functions: Display by means of hands: hours, minutes, seconds; date display in window

Winding stem: 3 positions: 1) Manual winding 2) Quick correction of date 3) Time setting

Barrel spring: Nivaflex 



  



Why the Sellita SW-200?
It wasn't easy choosing which Swiss automatic movement to use; we needed to consider many factors: accuracy, reliability, and secure supply for many years to come.
Sellita is a solid manufacturer with a long history of building movements and great emphasis on quality and customer support.





  


The dial of the LIV GX1-A is easy to read, thanks to its three-dimensional multi-layered construction and clean design. The indexes and hands are topped off with strong luminescence, the Super-LumiNova BGW9, which is aesthetically pleasing during the day and gives you great visibility at night.
 



  

Only sapphire (front and back) for this baby! The LIV GX1-A is the exact same high-quality anti-reflective sapphire crystal used in our first watch.

Our team sought to create ROTA from a longing passion to design high-end fashion sunglasses without the high-end retail sticker price that usually comes along with it. Like you, we were frustrated with paying hundreds of dollars for name brand sunglasses that looked nice but cost a whole days paycheck. 
We have spent the past year working tirelessly with designers in the fashion industry to create a new, original, stylish, and high-end quality collection of sunglasses at a reasonable price everyone can afford to wear this summer. 
With your support, we will be able to add fresh new designs to our collection, while still keeping our promise of keeping our prices fair and reasonable.





Our Promise. 

We've finalized our designs, ordered the initial collections and have built a strong relationship with a leading industry manufacturer for eyewear. All that is left is your generous support. 

Once our Indiegogo campaign finishes, our team will begin shipping the orders free to our awesome backers before Summer starts in June!


Your satisfaction is extremely important to us, which is why we've sourced the highest quality materials we can find all at a price that is affordable for everyone. 


Each of our glasses come with our signature packaging including a hardened case, microfiber, and custom box. Our glasses are made of a lightweight tough alloy steel blend with polarized UV400 lenses for maximum wearability and clarity. 


IMPORTANT: After placing your order on Indiegogo, please fill out this brief survey so we can get your exact sunglasses choices. We have over 50 different collections and colors of unique glasses, so please fill this quick survey carefully after ordering   https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/S5YDBL7                -Thank You!  

We Need your Support!In order to turn this dream of ours into a successful reality, we need your support. Not only does this mean pledging for one of our unique sunglasses, but sharing our story with your friends on social media. 

If you could do something as simple as tweeting or sharing this page on facebook, we would greatly appreciate it!

Women's Collections start at the beginning of the page, and Men's Collections start are at the end of the the page. (Sorry Guys, but Ladies first;-)

Dually based out of Melbourne, Australia, and London, England, they have created watches that are versatile for the beach, yet formal enough to be in a boardroom.</p><p>For the founders of CROFT, it was essential to have a product that is as much at home outdoors, as it is for formal occasions. Therefore the watches are produced with a scratch-resistant, highly durable, sapphire crystal glass with anti-reflective coating, as well as quick-release interchangeable leather watch straps, to make sure you always keep the watch looking fresh.</p><p>The team sought to ensure the watches were affordable after seeing the brand inflation and retail markup many popular brands pass on to consumers. We know the cost to these popular brands is a fraction of what they cost to buy in store due to the many intermediaries in the sales chain. We have streamlined the entire process and deliver directly to the consumer, bypassing all of the intermediaries along the way.</p><p>No detail has been left untouched with our watches. Every aspect has been considered, from the small detail of the logo lightly engraved onto the crown, through to running a production run of 100 watches to ensure that our watches look as beautiful as they do on paper.</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/714/442/c81059e7cc67463fcb5c6fd05f3da010_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1460641394&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=39d442196522d4a5b6409f3fdb247a50"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/686/746/d5fe92cd883e895d790c4540a138758b_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1460277017&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=dc7874cec87d4c32155380b83b12ad41"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p>To streamline the sales process we have moved away from the traditional sales channels of selling products to wholesalers, sales agents, distributors and traditional marketing techniques.</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/686/830/9fe18c614cd0c6361e24c9d3a1ca4634_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1460278409&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=37f329cbc2b87d147106adc0b54e0714"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p><b>Skills </b>- We have picked a strong team, and built a diverse network of contacts in all industries. The CROFT team has a wide range of skills, ranging from automotive manufacturing, custom automotive design and engineering, sports marketing, brand management, business management and investments. Collectively they can design, engineer, crunch numbers, and run a strong business.</p><p><b>Design</b> - The product designers within our team have a huge amount of experience in taking new and exciting ideas and turning them into reality. With talents ranging from drawing, through to graphic design and computer aided design, they are able to rapidly iterate and develop new ideas, whilst pushing the boundaries of what the manufacturers can produce. So much so they already have the next two models designed!</p><p><b>Materials</b> - Designing and engineering the Richmond from the ground up allowed the team to be selective in what materials to use. The materials used were selected for their balance between aesthetics and their underlying properties.</p><p><b>Supply chain</b> - We have spent over a year working with our manufacturers and suppliers. We have been to their factories, developed multiple prototypes and even run a small production of 100 watches (#THEFIRSTBATCH) to ensure we can deliver the product we say we can. We have dived into each and every detail, to not only ensure you will be happy but so that we can also proudly wear the watches.</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/758/823/ebeac8c70b7a57de9534b9ddd55265b6_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1461067979&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=0c825a31f594a29f43173317385f2801"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p>The initial Richmond collection comes in 8 different colour combinations.</p><p>Case: Polished stainless steel or Matt black PVD coated</p><p>Dial: Brilliant white or Jet black</p><p>Leather strap: Black or Mahogany</p><p>Buckle: Colour matched to the watch case</p><p>Hands: Colour matched to the watch case</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/758/850/2e1f5bb88fc79d975601dfe5e4e444aa_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1461068279&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=7441aefc0f110994a05cc61ebd9dbdc1"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/758/852/db0d2c32b15592e1c2e6ca18aa75aaaf_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1461068299&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=5e382d76c2ce9581a580f4cc1b6f14cd"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/682/652/5d380004e3054c5ae21ca1720240f7fd_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1460201497&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=1613555c18e51f64af9090cd8c7914d0"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p>Our First Collection, the Richmond, has a sapphire crystal lense and a surgical grade stainless steel case that measures 43mm in diameter and 9.3mm in thickness. These watches are powered by an accurate Japanese Miyota quartz movement, including a day/date (English/French) function and are water resistant up to 50 meters.</p><p>The Richmond comes in four initial designs; the matt black case and the steel case, each with either a black or mahogany leather strap. Each style has it's own unique benefits but all are stylish for any occasion, and sturdy enough to cope with most adventures.</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/714/462/2475c5b01f3186e5466ee8f39ff7b602_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1460641619&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=070fd2fb77c98978acafd24d600c0919"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p><b>Sapphire Crystal</b></p><p>Sapphire crystal is the name given to the glass on the watch. For our watches to stand up to the challenges of an active life, we have put sapphire crystal on all our watches as standard. It is the most common part of an expensive luxury watch, particularly due to its scratch resistance (the only material tougher than sapphire is diamond) and high durability. We have also added anti-reflective coating to reduce the appearance of reflections, but also to improve the colour of the dial by influencing the light passing through the lens.</p><p><b>Watch Case</b></p><p>Our cases and steel bands are made from surgical grade stainless steel (316L stainless steel). This means it has stronger resistance to corrosion than many other metal alloys, so can handle the rigours of changing environments much better. Along with that, it has better hardness and scratch resistance compared to other alloy metals.</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/714/468/050e7c9e5728e392ec272bca83980ba0_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1460641696&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=6059d9d79abebd45c64e7180f1f1430a"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p><b>Movement</b></p><p>At the heart of every CROFT Watch is a Japanese made Miyota movement - the same movement many luxury watchmakers use. It's an excellent quartz movement, has amazing shock resistance and a long battery life.</p><p><b>Case-Back</b></p><p>The case of a CROFT Watch doesn’t just stop there, we have also specially engraved each watch with LDN-MEL to represent London and Melbourne - the joint birthplace of CROFT Watches.</p><p>The ""Super Early Bird"", ""Early Kickstarter"" and ""Early Bird Double"" rewards each come with a specially engraved with ""FOUNDER'S EDITION"" and ""1 of 300"". Why these rewards you ask? To really benefit from economies of scale with our manufacturers we need to place an order for 300 pieces with them. We wanted to remind you that the watch you purchased got CROFT Watches off the ground and into production.</p><p>In the “First Batch” reward (reward No.3), we have engraved it specifically with “THE FIRST BATCH"" and ""1 of 100” to give you that unique product that you treasure forever.</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/714/450/6e0e43ce444ee99579aacc72d39373ce_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1460641465&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=825d9f8213e8b78ccc067a7b42237e12"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p><b>Dial</b></p><p>The dial is the most important part of the watch - how else will you tell the time?!

Dually based out of Melbourne, Australia, and London, England, they have created watches that are versatile for the beach, yet formal enough to be in a boardroom.For the founders of CROFT, it was essential to have a product that is as much at home outdoors, as it is for formal occasions. Therefore the watches are produced with a scratch-resistant, highly durable, sapphire crystal glass with anti-reflective coating, as well as quick-release interchangeable leather watch straps, to make sure you always keep the watch looking fresh.The team sought to ensure the watches were affordable after seeing the brand inflation and retail markup many popular brands pass on to consumers. We know the cost to these popular brands is a fraction of what they cost to buy in store due to the many intermediaries in the sales chain. We have streamlined the entire process and deliver directly to the consumer, bypassing all of the intermediaries along the way.No detail has been left untouched with our watches. Every aspect has been considered, from the small detail of the logo lightly engraved onto the crown, through to running a production run of 100 watches to ensure that our watches look as beautiful as they do on paper.To streamline the sales process we have moved away from the traditional sales channels of selling products to wholesalers, sales agents, distributors and traditional marketing techniques.Skills - We have picked a strong team, and built a diverse network of contacts in all industries. The CROFT team has a wide range of skills, ranging from automotive manufacturing, custom automotive design and engineering, sports marketing, brand management, business management and investments. Collectively they can design, engineer, crunch numbers, and run a strong business.Design - The product designers within our team have a huge amount of experience in taking new and exciting ideas and turning them into reality. With talents ranging from drawing, through to graphic design and computer aided design, they are able to rapidly iterate and develop new ideas, whilst pushing the boundaries of what the manufacturers can produce. So much so they already have the next two models designed!Materials - Designing and engineering the Richmond from the ground up allowed the team to be selective in what materials to use. The materials used were selected for their balance between aesthetics and their underlying properties.Supply chain - We have spent over a year working with our manufacturers and suppliers. We have been to their factories, developed multiple prototypes and even run a small production of 100 watches (#THEFIRSTBATCH) to ensure we can deliver the product we say we can. We have dived into each and every detail, to not only ensure you will be happy but so that we can also proudly wear the watches.The initial Richmond collection comes in 8 different colour combinations.Case: Polished stainless steel or Matt black PVD coatedDial: Brilliant white or Jet blackLeather strap: Black or MahoganyBuckle: Colour matched to the watch caseHands: Colour matched to the watch caseOur First Collection, the Richmond, has a sapphire crystal lense and a surgical grade stainless steel case that measures 43mm in diameter and 9.3mm in thickness. These watches are powered by an accurate Japanese Miyota quartz movement, including a day/date (English/French) function and are water resistant up to 50 meters.The Richmond comes in four initial designs; the matt black case and the steel case, each with either a black or mahogany leather strap. Each style has it's own unique benefits but all are stylish for any occasion, and sturdy enough to cope with most adventures.Sapphire CrystalSapphire crystal is the name given to the glass on the watch. For our watches to stand up to the challenges of an active life, we have put sapphire crystal on all our watches as standard. It is the most common part of an expensive luxury watch, particularly due to its scratch resistance (the only material tougher than sapphire is diamond) and high durability. We have also added anti-reflective coating to reduce the appearance of reflections, but also to improve the colour of the dial by influencing the light passing through the lens.Watch CaseOur cases and steel bands are made from surgical grade stainless steel (316L stainless steel). This means it has stronger resistance to corrosion than many other metal alloys, so can handle the rigours of changing environments much better. Along with that, it has better hardness and scratch resistance compared to other alloy metals.MovementAt the heart of every CROFT Watch is a Japanese made Miyota movement - the same movement many luxury watchmakers use. It's an excellent quartz movement, has amazing shock resistance and a long battery life.Case-BackThe case of a CROFT Watch doesn’t just stop there, we have also specially engraved each watch with LDN-MEL to represent London and Melbourne - the joint birthplace of CROFT Watches.The ""Super Early Bird"", ""Early Kickstarter"" and ""Early Bird Double"" rewards each come with a specially engraved with ""FOUNDER'S EDITION"" and ""1 of 300"". Why these rewards you ask? To really benefit from economies of scale with our manufacturers we need to place an order for 300 pieces with them. We wanted to remind you that the watch you purchased got CROFT Watches off the ground and into production.In the “First Batch” reward (reward No.3), we have engraved it specifically with “THE FIRST BATCH"" and ""1 of 100” to give you that unique product that you treasure forever.DialThe dial is the most important part of the watch - how else will you tell the time?! At CROFT Watches, we want to invite eyes to take a closer look and be excited by the stylish, minimalist design.The dial itself is made up of a thin metal plate, and then coated to provide the finish. The dial is then assembled with the colour matched steel markers, which requires precision tooling to place them accurately in their correct positions. StrapsEvery watch needs a strap and the quality of this is essential because an uncomfortable strap, is an uncomfortable watch.Every CROFT Watch uses 100% genuine cowhide leather straps that provide amazing comfort and longevity. Along with this, we have specially designed the buckle to be exactly the right size for the watch and have made them from 316L stainless steel, colour matched with the watch case and subtly branded with our CROFT crest.Our leather watch straps come with quick-release pins, allowing you to change the strap colour in less than 5 seconds, giving the watch a whole new character.Reward 1 - Extra Leather StrapOrder an extra genuine leather strap for your new watch. All leather straps have a quick-release pin which allows you to change the style of your watch in seconds. Saving up to 33% off the retail price!Reward 2 - Super Early Bird (Limited to only 100 watches)Our cheapest watch reward!

<br/><p>I just moved to Melbourne from France a month ago, and I have a great idea for a great project!... but I am going to need your help to make it happen.</p>
<p><b>The idea is to create the very first fashion truck of Melbourne.</b></p>

<p>A fashion truck is basically a moving version of a fashion store. Easy! :)</p>
<p>In the truck, I am going to be selling vintage clothing and accessories made by local designers. I find it very interesting to bring vintage clothing into modern style, and to mix it with unique accessories! I really want for the truck to have its unique style!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The truck will then be moving to any kind of event where it is relevant for it to be seen: vintage market, music festivals, parks... </p>
<p></p>

<br/><p>You can see it as a new selling method:  it is no longer the customer that goes to the store, but the store that comes to the customer.</p>

</div></div>","Hi everyone!


My name is Annie, I am a 26 years old french girl,  wishing to make my life extraordinary!


I just moved to Melbourne from France a month ago, and I have a great idea for a great project!... but I am going to need your help to make it happen.
The idea is to create the very first fashion truck of Melbourne.




A fashion truck is basically a moving version of a fashion store. Easy! :)
In the truck, I am going to be selling vintage clothing and accessories made by local designers. I find it very interesting to bring vintage clothing into modern style, and to mix it with unique accessories! I really want for the truck to have its unique style!

The truck will then be moving to any kind of event where it is relevant for it to be seen: vintage market, music festivals, parks... 


You can see it as a new selling method:  it is no longer the customer that goes to the store, but the store that comes to the customer.
Once the truck is launched, I would also like to do partnerships with other brands that could be related: have a nail day, a make-up day, a cupcake day... make everyday an exciting day!

In order to make it happen, I am going to need money to buy the truck, to change it into a fashion store, to decorate it, and finally, to buy the amazing clothes to put in it!!!
Thank you very much in advance for all your help :)   
GOAL AND ACHIEVMENTS In order to get the business started, I am going to need $15,000. This money will be used to buy the truck, to change its inside and outside look and to buy the clothes.
I will also need some money to pay for the spots in the vintage markets or music festivals.
This project is very important and exciting to me!! I have been working in the fashion industry for the last few years, but  I really want to start something new, to work on a project that makes sense to me, to do my own fashion!
Plus, this fashion truck will be the very first one in Melbourne! The truck trend is very big all over the world at the moment, so I want to jump in and be part of this adventure!



   Your Impact The big advantage with that project is that the financial investment is not huge. I really only need enough money to buy the truck and modify it into a store. There will be no monthly rent, and no other major investment.
But I will not be able to do it without your help.
I moved to Melbourne to change my life and to prove to myself that I am able to go through with my personal project. I need your help for the first push! :)
Your contribution might change my life...
Let the adventure begin :)

I'm very blessed that God has giving me this gift of music to share with each and every one of you out there. 

What am I trying to make?

As a musician, I think my music isn't complete without merchandise. So, I'm planning on making Summer Breeze clothing. These clothes will be more on the urban/hip-hop style shirts. I'm designing something fresh and clean so all your friends will be jealous when you wear one. With these clothes, it'll also give you something to wear in public to show your support for my music.

But thanks to people on Facebook, I've thought it over and decided to go for it!


Here's where I'm going to need YOUR help!

By making t-shirts, it takes money. Now, this is the part where I need your help. Throughout my music career, I've struggled with a lot of payments for my tuition for school, credit card bills, and spending money to pay for my studio. It's really hard when it comes to providing for myself in this type of career. It's always been my dream in high school to start a clothing line. This is my time to shine and to fulfill that dream that I had in high school.

Your donations will be spent to:
*pay the designer
*pay for the shirts
*pay for the printing
*pay for the shipments

So I ask you to PLEASE donate as much as your heart desires. You get cool prizes for each level of donation you make. Cool prizes from music downloads, albums, skype calls, Summer Breeze clothes, singing voicemails, Youtube shout-outs, and more! 

I don't really ask much from my supporters but I hope you can support this project. Every dollar counts! And if you cannot donate for whatever reason, please share this project and link with all your friends on Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. I would greatly appreciate it!

<h1>How Do GemPhones Work? </h1>
<p>GemPhones are compatible with any 
mobile or audio device that has a standard 3.5mm jack (all major phones 
and MP3 devices have this). Simply, insert the GemPhones’ plug into the 
jack for playback. </p>
<p>To wear GemPhones, open the necklace by 
releasing the small magnetic clasp, place the two ends around opposite 
sides of your neck (like any ordinary necklace), and reconnect the 
magnetic clasp. The earbuds can hang discreetly behind your back or add 
flair to your necklace by hanging over your shoulders. Just place the 
earbuds in your ears when ready to use your GemPhones. </p>
<p>Here’s a little information about the earbuds we use for our GemPhones:</p>
<p>•	Built-in Microphone </p>
<p>•	Two button remote to answer/end calls or play/stop music </p>
<p>•	Replaceable silicone earbud covers </p>
<p>•	CE and RoHS Compliant </p>
<p>•	Great Sound and Audio Driver Quality </p>
<p>•	Cord Length: 1.2m </p>

technology and fashion collide. We are creating the new look of sound.
GemPhones: The Styles 




Fashion, Meet Function.
GemPhones are fashion, music, and conversation all wrapped in one stylish package.
 Whether racing to class, strutting around town, or just lounging at 
home, you can rest assured that you’ll always look great and feel 
connected with GemPhones. Our beaded necklaces serve as 
fully-functioning earphones and microphones – allowing you to listen to 
music wherever you are and chat with friends on the go.    GemPhones 
were made with our tech-centered generation in mind. 
Each pair of
 GemPhones includes a magnetic clasp that allows you to quickly and 
easily secure or remove your necklace. The beads are tangle-proof. Plus,
 each pair includes three sizes of earbuds to guarantee a snug fit as 
you set out to conquer your day. 

Wear it like a necklace.

A Gem of An Idea






Your clothing, shoes, jewelry, and even your hairstyle are used to 
express who you are to the outside world. Now, GemPhones can add to your
 stylish byline, communicating a unique story that sets you apart from 
the crowd.
We’ve designed a small handful of beautiful Gemphones for our first 
edition. This collection was designed to complement every personality. 
We look forward to releasing more collections and some of our more 
daring designs in the near future. 



Your Life, Your Style, Your GemPhones 
Did you know 
that GemPhones can be customized to be a true representation of you? 
Show your school spirit with customized GemPhones on Game Day. Or, 
represent your sorority with coordinating colors. Do you support a great
 cause? Customize your GemPhones to promote the cancer organization or 
other awareness group of your choice. 
Whatever you decide, our GemPhones can be designed with colors and 
materials to reflect you. 

Great Sound Quality and Noise Cancelling Features

How Do GemPhones Work? 
GemPhones are compatible with any 
mobile or audio device that has a standard 3.5mm jack (all major phones 
and MP3 devices have this). Simply, insert the GemPhones’ plug into the 
jack for playback. 
To wear GemPhones, open the necklace by 
releasing the small magnetic clasp, place the two ends around opposite 
sides of your neck (like any ordinary necklace), and reconnect the 
magnetic clasp. The earbuds can hang discreetly behind your back or add 
flair to your necklace by hanging over your shoulders. Just place the 
earbuds in your ears when ready to use your GemPhones. 
Here’s a little information about the earbuds we use for our GemPhones:
•	Built-in Microphone 
•	Two button remote to answer/end calls or play/stop music 
•	Replaceable silicone earbud covers 
•	CE and RoHS Compliant 
•	Great Sound and Audio Driver Quality 
•	Cord Length: 1.2m 
•	Jack Size: 3.5mm 



Our Progress
We’ve been working on our GemPhones design 
and functionality for over a year. We have a functioning prototype and a
 patent pending. We’re currently in a Memphis-based accelerator for 
women in technology and are proud of the traction, publicity, and 
interest we’ve received thus far. 
Now, we need your support. 
With
 your commitment to our Indiegogo campaign, we’ll be able to introduce
 the new look of sound to the world. Specifically, your contribution 
will help fund: 
- Manufacturing tooling and equipment October 2013

<p><b><i>The Common Thread Collective is not a business or product line.  It is a training center created as a means to support women and stop the cycle of trafficking, poverty, and violence through economic empowerment. </i></b></p>
<p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b>Our Future</b></p>
<p> We have only just begun.  In 2016, we plan to extend our reach by opening our second location in the village of Gulu.  By opening a new state of the art training center in Gulu we will be able to form partnerships with the local fair trade fashion industry that exists there, enabling us to provide good jobs for our students upon program completion.  </p>
<p>Over the last two years we have been fortunate to have helped over 100 women lift themselves out of their undesirable positions through the CTC’s curriculum of self-sustaining life skills.  Although we are proud of our accomplishments, we’ve only just begun!  There are so many more women in need and we won’t rest until we try to help all of them.  </p>
<p><b><i>With your support, we can provide The Common Thread Collective with the means to reach its full potential!</i></b></p>

<p><b>Our Challenges</b></p>
<p><b>Working in Uganda is a constant challenge!  Some of these challenges include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Access to fabric and other sewing materials-</b> Kampala is the closest city in which materials can be purchased, but it is still several hours away and the suppliers can be somewhat inconsistent.  We have developed relationships with market vendors to set aside supplies we need on a consistent basis so we can pick up what we need in Kampala on a set schedule.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Staying Safe-</b> Kapeeka can be a dangerous place with looting from militia and rebel fighters and citizens praying on the weak out of desperation.  For this reason we have electric fences surrounding the compound perimeter and 24 hour security to keep our program students and staff safe.  Students and staff must feel safe and comfortable so they can focus and do the best work possible!</p></li>
<li><p><b>Fashion Design Teachers-</b> Finding kind, well trained Fashion Design teachers that have the sensitivity to work with the girls and women, are motivated, are good communicators and who want to have a long term relationship and employment with the CTC.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Staying Healthy-</b> Uganda is a difficult place to stay healthy, especially for westerners who are not accustomed to the bacteria and pollution.  Only 64% of Uganda has access to clean water with most rural locations having to walk over half a mile to access sites.  Disease-carrying mosquitos are also a constant problem in Uganda.  We take a number of measures on campus to ensure drinking water, food, and working conditions are clean, safe, and free from contamination.  Keeping our students healthy so they can be at their best is important to their development and overall well-being. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Keeping up with demand-</b> We have an ever-growing wait list of students wanting to start our program but lack the money for additional machines, supplies, teachers, and food to increase enrollment.  By increasing our grant-writing and fundraising outreach we are tackling this problem head on.  This is where you come in!  </p></li>

“In too many instances, the march to globalization has also meant the marginalization of women and girls. And that must change.” -- Hillary Clinton

The Impact
We are offering opportunities for Women to empower themselves through the development of creative job skills, emotional and mental growth, and basic education. 



Upon graduation of our program, students have the skills needed to start their own business or are offered dignified work with one of our product line partners where they earn fair wages and great benefits, work flexible hours, and participate in a positive community! 




 We are supporting female survivors of rape, slavery, prostitution, and physical abuse.  We help provide the stability and support our students need to speak their truths, know their worth, and know that they can do great things with their lives.

They provide the courage and will, we provide the tools to help them succeed.  With the support of this campaign, we will expand our program in Kapeeka and solidify partnerships and plans in Gulu. 









                    

Our Beginning 
Uganda is considered to be the Pearl of Africa, it is ripe in beauty, full of friendly people, and is the birthplace of the mighty Nile River that provides life to many in Eastern Africa. Hidden under the multitude of beautiful layers, however, is a tumultuous past that involves political skirmishes resulting in ethnic cleansing, genocide, abductions, forced servitude, and the complete eradication of entire villages.  Many villages of Uganda recently  saw almost 80% of their  people slaughtered as part of “population control” during The War of the Bush.   As a result, today women are often in  the position of picking up the financial pieces and many find themselves forced into prostitution, taking what they are told will be a well-paying job in the city. Even worse, they are often forced to take their children along, who then fall into the same tragic fate.



It was in one of these rural war torn villages named Kapeeka, at the end of the highway from Kampala, that we started working with seven women in a bullet-ridden schoolhouse. The women came to us as peasants who made roughly $10 a month. Most of them relied on digging and prostitution at the local army bases for income. The average age for a prostitute to start work in Kapeeka was a mere 8 years old. We were devastated. 



Our seven women quickly grew to 42 as word spread throughout the village and neighboring areas. We ran out of supplies and had women cutting up bed sheets or old cloth to take lessons, and women were coming in for one on one instruction as early as 5 am and sewing by gas lantern.



Our Program Today
We now have a waiting list of over 150 women to get into our program. In Kapeeka we operate a community center that runs classes in needlework, embroidery, patternmaking, tailoring, accessories design, fashion design, and hand and machine sewing, as well as Math, English, and Writing. The participants are provided with health care, sanitation classes, mentorship, and a financial coach to teach responsible approaches to money.



Our program attendees also have unlimited access to the community center where they can utilize our equipment and supplies to create and produce goods to sell in the local market. We provide our advanced students with a living stipend and cover the costs of their children’s education. The advanced students work with us to produce a simple line of tote bags and fabric purses that we sell to help fund our program. 




These bags cover around 8% of our total program expenses.  We also want to help bring transformation to the community at large, and to that end all of our fabrics come from female owned stalls in the Kampala market or are hand woven and dyed for us out of 100% organic Ugandan Cotton at a Kampala weaving cooperative for women with Aids.


              

The Common Thread Collective is not a business or product line.  It is a training center created as a means to support women and stop the cycle of trafficking, poverty, and violence through economic empowerment. 


Our Future
 We have only just begun.  In 2016, we plan to extend our reach by opening our second location in the village of Gulu.  By opening a new state of the art training center in Gulu we will be able to form partnerships with the local fair trade fashion industry that exists there, enabling us to provide good jobs for our students upon program completion.  
Over the last two years we have been fortunate to have helped over 100 women lift themselves out of their undesirable positions through the CTC’s curriculum of self-sustaining life skills.  Although we are proud of our accomplishments, we’ve only just begun!  There are so many more women in need and we won’t rest until we try to help all of them.  
With your support, we can provide The Common Thread Collective with the means to reach its full potential!

What We Need

We need your support to help us expand enrollment in 2015 to give more women the opportunity to empower themselves.  To do this, we’re in need of money to support tuition related costs, additional equipment, supplies, and educators.

Why We Will Succeed

We know our program works. The proof is in our successful graduates
We have a strong team of board members that are committed to seeing growth of the organization
Our board members and volunteer staff have the business savvy and apparel industry experience to propel the program to the next level
For over two years, we have steadily gained support from Kapeeka and surrounding communities 
Our founder (Jessica) has established connections with socially conscious clothing brands that will help us prepare and position our students for employment after their program completion
We have graduated over 100 students thus far with another 150+ on a wait list eager and waiting to get started with your help!


Our Challenges
Working in Uganda is a constant challenge!  Some of these challenges include:

Access to fabric and other sewing materials- Kampala is the closest city in which materials can be purchased, but it is still several hours away and the suppliers can be somewhat inconsistent.  We have developed relationships with market vendors to set aside supplies we need on a consistent basis so we can pick up what we need in Kampala on a set schedule.
Staying Safe- Kapeeka can be a dangerous place with looting from militia and rebel fighters and citizens praying on the weak out of desperation.  For this reason we have electric fences surrounding the compound perimeter and 24 hour security to keep our program students and staff safe.  Students and staff must feel safe and comfortable so they can focus and do the best work possible!
Fashion Design Teachers- Finding kind, well trained Fashion Design teachers that have the sensitivity to work with the girls and women, are motivated, are good communicators and who want to have a long term relationship and employment with the CTC.
Staying Healthy- Uganda is a difficult place to stay healthy, especially for westerners who are not accustomed to the bacteria and pollution.  Only 64% of Uganda has access to clean water with most rural locations having to walk over half a mile to access sites.  Disease-carrying mosquitos are also a constant problem in Uganda.  We take a number of measures on campus to ensure drinking water, food, and working conditions are clean, safe, and free from contamination.  Keeping our students healthy so they can be at their best is important to their development and overall well-being. 
Keeping up with demand- We have an ever-growing wait list of students wanting to start our program but lack the money for additional machines, supplies, teachers, and food to increase enrollment.  By increasing our grant-writing and fundraising outreach we are tackling this problem head on.  This is where you come in!  

Our future students need your help!

Through your support and IM’s illegal firearms destruction program, we were able to launch the first-ever TRIWA X Humanium Metal Watch on Kickstarter.Now, we’re back with a bigger humanitarian goal than ever.Meet TRIWA X Humanium Metal 2.0: Forged from Humanium Metals of illegal firearms, stamped with the symbolic Humanium Metal logo, bold and sophisticated in slate grey steel with fiery red accents.Telling a new story of hope for a country where one out of every 1,000 residents will die as a result of gun violence.It’s time for peace.     In 2015, El Salvador was considered the world’s most deadly country outside a war zone. The homicide rate was epidemic, and nearly 80% of crimes were being committed with illegal firearms. The cost of this violence wasn’t limited to human life, with staggering social and economic consequences hanging in the balance. When you wear a TRIWA X Humanium Metal 2.0 watch, you become part of the journey to change all this. The destructed firearm on your wrist is not only a firearm that can never again be used for harm but a way to infuse hope back into conflict-torn communities. Thanks to our nonprofit partner, IM, directly benefits the society from which the firearms were originally collected and supports the victims of armed violence.THIS is a watch you can be proud to wear.With our TRIWA X Humanium Metal 2.0 collection, we’re elevating our designs to a new level of subtlety and sophistication. Every watch comes with a certificate of authenticity, an exclusively made box, and elements of artisan craftsmanship that we firmly believe are second-to-none.  Meet Hu39 ChronoProven to be a robust and accurate timekeeper, the HU39 Chrono comes with Citizen-Miyota JS00 chronograph movement, a 30 min/sec stopwatch function, and 24-hour time tracking. Artisan details include a molded Humanium Metal case stamped with the Humanium Metal logo and three stamped out mini dials with matching indexes and a circular brushed finish. The hour, minute and chronograph hands are all luminous in light green, while the second hand comes in our characteristic signal red with two polished pushers as a contrast to the matte brushed case. The crown is made with the same pattern as a revolver chamber, with a signal red navel.Available in two color/finish options: Slate grey or classic.   Meet Hu39 Automatic SlateMade for watch connoisseurs and finished in slate grey Humanium Metal, the HU39 Automatic Slate features 24 jewels, Miyota automatic movement and 48-hour running time. The movement is covered with a stainless steel backplate to make it durable and water-resistant. This statement piece is made to last for generations.  The flagship Humanium Metal weapons destruction program was initiated in November 2016 in El Salvador. In cooperation with Salvadoran authorities, IM produced 1.5 tons of Humanium Metal. Since then, the program has been directly involved in the removal and destruction of thousands of illegal firearms.TRIWA X Humanium Metal is an extension of this program, contributing to the demand for Humanium Metal while raising funds for anti-violence initiatives.After our first campaign in 2018, IM was able to melt down almost 1,500 illegal firearms (4,500  in total). Our flagship Humanium Metal Watch is now part of the UNs permanent exhibition of disarmament.With TRIWA X Humanium Metal 2.0, we hope to make an even bigger impact.More destructed illegal weapons, more anti-violence funding. More PEACE.In 2018, the world rallied behind our cause. Later that same year, we were proud to be able to ship our first ever batch of Humanium Metal watches to backers around the world.

<p>Like most travelers, we do whatever it takes to travel with carry-on luggage, and don’t even own check-in luggage. However, in the rare instance that you need to pack a bit more, Marlon’s expansion feature converts your case into check-in size.</p>

<h1>REMOVABLE BATTERY + 2 USB PORTS</h1>
<p>Technology can integrate beautifully with luggage, and that’s why we opted to include a charging function, as this is one of the most practical features we've tested. Designed with connected travelers in mind, Marlon comes with a 10400mAh removable battery and two USB ports. Unlike other connected luggage, Marlon’s battery pack is easily accessible and has no internal wires. This means you’ll breeze through security without being interrogated.</p>

<h1> </h1>
<h1>OVERSIZED WHEELS</h1>
<p>One of the chief designs we explicitly pursued was two oversized wheels that are easily user-replaceable rather than omni-directional wheels which have become a popular gimmick. They provide three critical advantages:</p>
<p><b>1. More packing space.</b> Omnidirectional wheels occupy at least 20% more space.</p>
<div data-id=""13027721""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.giphy.com/l0HlKqZbbeWfp4YZW.gif"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p><b>2. Greater mobility on rough surfaces. </b>Two large wheels with a stronger attachment to the body can better handle rough terrain and survive longer in impact tests than four small exposed wheels.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>3. Stability</b>. Two wheels will never tip or roll away from you on an incline like omnidirectional wheels. Have you ever seen someone on the metro or AirTran desperately trying to stop their luggage from flying around? Not a good look.</p>

<p>Designed in London using only premium materials, Marlon is built to last. The central material is a molded 1000D weather proofed, triple coated ballistic nylon. This proprietary nylon construction is perfectly balanced for light weight and abrasion resistance. In addition we use industrial grade aluminum and premium, custom YKK zippers. The Aquaguard zippers also allow you to lock the bag using a standard TSA lock.</p>

<p>Marlon's interior gives you the largest packing compartment in the market plus two mesh pockets on either side for socks, underwear, or anything else you don’t want to lose track of.</p>

<p>Marlon has a versatile, full-access compartment that tailors to your needs. Whether you're storing button down shirts, shoes, makeup and accessories, or dirty laundry, this space gives you the flexibility to adapt your packing for any trip. Also, the exterior of this compartment houses two additional mesh pockets for organization.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>If you're a minimalist traveler, Marlon lets you go backpack- or tote-free by storing your laptop and tablet in a padded sleeve for protection. The front, gusseted pocket is also ideal for a pair of running shoes, sandals, notebook or documents, or other semi-flat items.</p>

Like most travelers, we do whatever it takes to travel with carry-on luggage, and don’t even own check-in luggage. However, in the rare instance that you need to pack a bit more, Marlon’s expansion feature converts your case into check-in size.
 
 
REMOVABLE BATTERY + 2 USB PORTS
Technology can integrate beautifully with luggage, and that’s why we opted to include a charging function, as this is one of the most practical features we've tested. Designed with connected travelers in mind, Marlon comes with a 10400mAh removable battery and two USB ports. Unlike other connected luggage, Marlon’s battery pack is easily accessible and has no internal wires. This means you’ll breeze through security without being interrogated.
 
 
OVERSIZED WHEELS
One of the chief designs we explicitly pursued was two oversized wheels that are easily user-replaceable rather than omni-directional wheels which have become a popular gimmick. They provide three critical advantages:
1. More packing space. Omnidirectional wheels occupy at least 20% more space.
 
 
2. Greater mobility on rough surfaces. Two large wheels with a stronger attachment to the body can better handle rough terrain and survive longer in impact tests than four small exposed wheels.
  
 
3. Stability. Two wheels will never tip or roll away from you on an incline like omnidirectional wheels. Have you ever seen someone on the metro or AirTran desperately trying to stop their luggage from flying around? Not a good look.
  
 

 
Designed in London using only premium materials, Marlon is built to last. The central material is a molded 1000D weather proofed, triple coated ballistic nylon. This proprietary nylon construction is perfectly balanced for light weight and abrasion resistance. In addition we use industrial grade aluminum and premium, custom YKK zippers. The Aquaguard zippers also allow you to lock the bag using a standard TSA lock.


 
Our robust handle with a soft-touch, ergonomic grip, looks as good as it feels, even when rolling Marlon at its heaviest.
 
 

 
Marlon's interior gives you the largest packing compartment in the market plus two mesh pockets on either side for socks, underwear, or anything else you don’t want to lose track of.
 
 
Marlon has a versatile, full-access compartment that tailors to your needs. Whether you're storing button down shirts, shoes, makeup and accessories, or dirty laundry, this space gives you the flexibility to adapt your packing for any trip. Also, the exterior of this compartment houses two additional mesh pockets for organization.
  
 
If you're a minimalist traveler, Marlon lets you go backpack- or tote-free by storing your laptop and tablet in a padded sleeve for protection. The front, gusseted pocket is also ideal for a pair of running shoes, sandals, notebook or documents, or other semi-flat items.
 
 
Outside of the laptop sleeve is a designated quick access pocket to store your phone and loose items at the security line. No more grabbing one of those little buckets to throw your phone and watch into last minute.
  
 
Marlon even has a concealed back pocket that stores the battery and provides an out-of-sight holder for your phone while it’s charging.
 Please note. Shipping will be charged upon the conclusion of the campaign through a fulfillment platform called BackerKit.   The team at Morrama have worked with established brands including Virgin, Homeserve, and Braiform as well as upcoming start-ups and entrepreneurs, to take their ideas from concept to manufacture. With over 15 years of industry experience, the multidisciplinary team have brought their understanding and enthusiasm for great design to Marlon Travel, helping to develop the connected compression carry-on. With the tooling data ready for production, it is only your financial support needed to make Marlon a reality.",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

Or when we need energy for a mental or physical challenge ahead of us
It's also a great little helper for falling and staying asleep!
That’s what Pocket Sky does for you: After twenty minutes of exposure to its soft blue light, Pocket Sky significantly boosts your wakefulness, performance and wellbeing. Institute for Sleep-Wake-Research, Vienna“Since bright light is one of the strongest “Zeitgeber” to regulate our circadian clock and thereafter our sleep-wake rhythm, the application of light has a wide range of beneficial properties.Pocket Sky is a user friendly and easy-to-apply tool for ambulatory light exposure and may be beneficial for stabilizing the sleep-wake rhythm as well as improving wellbeing during periods of low exposure to natural light. Therefore, the ISWF will use Pocket Sky in studies to apply blue light to enhance alertness (e.g. on the road, during nightshift) or as a tool to boost fitness and performance (e.g. for sportive activities).” Michael Geyer and Mark Wallerberger are the founders of Pocket Sky. The two tech- and design savvy Austrians and their team have a history of developing sophisticated wearables together.   Mark is an award-winning product design professional with a knack for smart wearables such as glasses, headwear and shoes. He studied industrial design in Vienna. He spent many years as a lecturer at the Vienna University of Technology and working for the renowned Austrian design bureau EOOS. Mark loves to travel and hates jet lag.Michael is our expert in microelectronics, software design and opto-electronics. He studied electronics, IT and health data processing. Before coming up with the idea of Pocket Sky he was the founder of a company specializing in hard- and software development, testing and simulations. Being quite the creative inventor, Michael holds several patents in the field of wearables. He also builds cameras for 3D photography and likes to draw photo-realistic portraits. He knows what it means to suffer during a long and dark winter.Harald is responsible for communications. He writes blogs, social media postings and press releases. Nikola wrote Pocket Sky’s software, which for example controls the light intensity, loading time or the indicator LEDs of Pocket Sky. Hans is the team's expert in finances and business strategy. Miriam is our marketing specialist with experience in growth marketing and crowdfunding.

<p>The main use case for VitalBand is for seniors who either choose to age in place or want to maintain their independence. Without anyone around to see a fall or hear cries for help, VitalBand automatically detects a fall and calls out and alerts pre-programmed emergency contacts so help arrives quickly.</p>

<h3>For Teens</h3>

<p>As we finished our first prototype, many of our friends suggested this watch would be useful for their children in high school or college. Because of the 'panic' button on the face of the watch, if your student feels threatened or in danger, he or she could automatically call out and text for help.</p>

<p>Aside from emergency alerts, VitalBand also monitors heart rate, respiration rate, activity levels, calories burned, is fully waterproof, shows date and time, and can be pre-programmed to show medical reminders and goal notifications. Because of these sports-oriented functions, many athletes have also shown interest in our watch as well.</p>

<p>VitalBand began out of necessity; many of us at the company felt strongly that as ""aging in place"" became the norm, our parents were facing more danger than ever. Falls are the number one cause of death for people over 65 years old, and despite these facts, our parents were too humiliated to wear the pendant. It's an admission of infirmity. </p>
<p>As a result of this need, we created VitalBand, the first ever automatic fall detection smart watch. Unlike the pendant, when you fall, it calls - automatically. It's also a fully functioning smart watch, so anyone would be proud to wear it. </p>

Use the clean canvas of your POULS boots to create your own story. Make them yours. This is what like to say. Get them muddy as you hike along a trail, you bike around the city or just wear them as your everyday companion.   In the beginning POULS will start with two well known pair of boots. Therefor we took the traditional Casual Boot and the Ankle Boot or Chelsea Boot. Both shoes are available for Men and Women.Like other big companies we don't want to separate between genders. Develop your own canvas.      This is what we like to say.  Get them muddy as you hike along a trail, you bike around the city or just wear them as your everyday companion. Don‘t worry about the dust and dirt that gather during your daily routine. Our handcrafted POULS boots be your go-to footwear all day, every day. They are made in Portugal under fair conditions. One big issue we had in mind to get amazing products with the ability to last: Find a manufacturer in Portugal, currently the leading country for high-quality production of footwear.   We came up with a style, that works for every occasion and activity, while keeping our design to one, that not only looks good but feels great as well.  For us, it was very important to install a Corporate Product Language. You will remember a POULS Boot.  And the best thing is: These shoes are UNISEX!  We want you to get full use out of your shoes for years to come and use high-quality rough& tough leather or vegan microfibers to fulfil the different needs of our customers. Our goal was a portfolio of different shoes. Different types of shoes, a different type of innovative materials.  Great details like rivets or waxed laces and a couple of added values make PØULS shoes to Allrounder for all seasons and moments.   UNISEXWe don't want to seperate between genders. For us it is really important, that everybody can enjoy his or her pair of PØULS-Boots.    We wanted to start with these two boots. The timeline is still full of ideas and concepts. At the moment we have two new boots in the pipeline. Interesting times we would like to share with you guys. The design is an iterating process.  BACKINGUnfortunately we have issues with some perks. You can't type in your country when you make the payment. So we have to do that manually. You will write a mail to us where we have to send the shoes.

The idea of making the perfect Aviator-style sunglasses made us both very excited and we decided to quickly turn the idea into reality. After a lot of back-and-forth about the look, what materials to use etc. we finally came to a decision and are now proud to present our new prototype to you. Since we first started our own brand about 2 years ago we have always kept the same objective: to beat the market prices while using the best materials possible. While most sunglasses out there are easy to break and/or are being absurdly over prized we went out to try to find a way to make our sunglasses as durable as we could, while at the same time keeping them as delicate as they should be. We decided to go with titanium.Titanium metal is the top material of choice in the aerospace industry due to its high strength-to-weight ratio As it also owns extreme temperature and corrosion resistance, we figured that it would be the ideal material for us to use. Always be in style with the Titan Black. These will definitely fit any occasion.These badass aviators goes with everything. Class and elegance in perfect symbiosis.For the more luxurious look, be sure to draw looks with the Titan Gold.As shown above, our titanium aviators comes in three different colors - Black, Gun metal and Gold. As a backer you can choose the one that you think will fit you best. If you have a hard time choosing we also give you an awesome package deal where you can mix the color of frames and lenses as you like!Besides just giving our aviators a cooler look, the color we use has a protective function. This new technology we use as coating of our frames is super strong, have a high antioxidant capacity and is much healthier to our environment to produce.We always look for the best quality we can find. Therefore we use hyper-extendable german OBE hinges for our Titan sunglasses.All of our Titan sunglasses comes in an exclusive foldable PU leather box.​We all know how important it is with good packaging and how happy we get when we recieve a gift where the package feels at least as exclusive as the content. We have tried out a whole bunch of different boxes in the search for the right one. One that gives the right protection as well as the right look. Every pair of our Titan sunglasses comes with an exclusive PU leather box that easily can be folded so it does't take up any space when you have your shades on!The lenses might just be the most important part of a pair of sunglasses. And what good would they do if they didn't match the high quality of the titanium frames? We have searched long and hard to find the right lenses and are proud to present the optics for our Titans.First off we use 7 layer polarized lenses that effectively reduces glare, eliminating dazzling light reflection and scattered light which makes the vision more soft and clear. The polaroid lenses have seven layers composite materials with UV400 ultraviolet ray standard. This means that they block all wavelengths of light from 400 nm, which covers all of the UV spectrum. The first and last layer features a clear and durable scratch-resistant layer to avoid any damage you expose them to.   Besides the quality of the lenses we wanted to highten the diversity so that you can give your Titans a more personalized look. The solution was to design them so that you safely and easily can change the lenses yourself. With bunch different colors of polarized lenses you can give your Titans a new look every day of the week! We provide an easy and safe way to change your lenses. We do not settle for mediocre. We do not believe that we would gain anything in the long run if we would over-price our products, using cheap materials and fine words. We believe that if we put ourselves out there with products we can be proud of, knowing that all the time and effort we put into them In return for your support and belief in us we offer some great rewards. Besides our new exclusive Titan collection, we also give you the chance to get our previous collections with great discounts.  Go to www.zerpico.com for more of our Carbon Fiber sunglasses.Native and Wade from our Eyewood Collection. Go to www.zerpico.com for more.   Twins Sara and Carmen rocking the Gun metal and Gold.​ First of all, all of you! We would't be what we are if it wasn't for Kickstarter and the fans we have recieved through the community. We have built lasting bonds through medias like these and are grateful for being able to bring ideas into reality and to live in an age where this is possible.We are on a mission to show you all that there is more than the big corporations out there. That you don't have to pay such high prizes just because they are established brands. We try our best to promote and provide our products at a fair price and by selling directly to consumers through social media and our own website we can accomplish just that. This campaign is yet another steppingstone and on this road we have come in contact with a lot of awesome people that were happy to work with us and together make something we all can be proud of. This project wouldn't be what it is today if it wasn't for them.Risks and challengesFirst off. this is our second Kickstarter project. Our first campaign went as expected and we kept the timeline perfectly. We have carefully chosen the best factories, and can garantee that the process will run as smoothly as possible.Of course there can always be unforeseen problems that we cannot control. But if a problem comes up, we will do everything we can to fix it as fast as possible.We will always keep you updated on any crucial information about the production and shipping of products.Thank you for believing in us!",34.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<p>Hi, my name is Mark and I own a small t-shirt company.  I founded the company in 2008 and business is growing, but I find myself at a cross roads that I myself can not undertake.</p>
<p>Growing a business is hard without having the proper capital needed to invest in equipment.  Currently we are doing well in the traditional screen printing market and expect business to only pick up even more with our new ""Critter Scents"" line as it is Exclusive to this Indiegogo Campaign,  . . . but, I am losing business in the digital printing market because we do not have a digital t-shirt printing press.</p>
<p>I am here on indiegogo to let everyone know about my offering of 10%+ of my business in exchange for a digital printer and in exchange I think I have come up with some nifty perks for my investors, but wait, the best part is, this is one investment that keeps paying as the corporate shares perk will pay investors long after this indiegogo is over.</p>
<p>You see, I am serious about my business succeeding and I believe people who invest in me should also share in the rewards of the company's acheivements, Corporate Stock seemed like a great way for me to express my gratitude for helping us reach our goal, but more importantly business is really built on relationships with others and for this reason I thought if people could own a piece of greatness they would feel as inspired and enriched as I do.  Giving up 10% of my company was not an easy desision to make, but I wanted you to understand how important this printer is to our business and how much your contribution means.  I would like to thank everyone in advance for taking the time to look at my offering, I understand this is not for everyone, but maybe you know someone you think this would be great for, please feel free to pass along this info.  </p>

<h3>Our Story and the Birth of Technical Adrenaline</h3>
<p>Hello my name is Kimberly Tanny and I am a martial arts and fitness instructor.  I have been training in the martial arts for 10 years and earned my 3rd degree black belt in ITF Taekwon-do last year in June 2011.  I own a small martial arts school in Aurora, CO where I teach Taekwon-do, fitness kickboxing and women's self defense.  I recently started a new program that is a fusion of traditional martial arts with modern martial arts (acrobatic techniques, powerful jumping/flying kicks and martial arts weapons).  In the quest to search for the perfect name for my new class and wanting to use the abbreviation of my martial arts school (TAMA), I came up with Technical Adrenaline Martial Arts.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The technical aspect fits because we focus on proper technique, making each kick, strike, block or stance as sharp and correct as possible.  The adrenaline comes from all the jumping and flying techniques or acrobatic moves.  It also comes from the adrenaline rush of competing in a tournament or demonstrating in front of a large crowd.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The clothing line came about because I wanted my students to be able to wear our own logo t-shirts and training apparel.  Eventually I became stuck on the idea of turning Technical Adrenaline into a clothing line.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Well, what makes Technical Adrenaline unique?  We're not just another t-shirt brand.  Technical Adrenaline represents a population of martial artists that is fairly large. There are millions and millions of martial artists practicing world wide, but there isn't a whole lot of basic martial arts street wear that exists, mainly just shirts and apparel for MMA, but not that other side of martial arts.  Technical Adrenaline's goal is to outfit these extreme martial artists and provide a way for them to truly express themselves all while looking stylish.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>My goal</h3>
<div>My goal is to create a new t-shirt brand that represents modern martial artists (not just MMA).  I am hoping to create comfortable street wear that represents who these kids, teens and adults are.  Those who live and breathe martial arts and have that passion and drive to train, compete and learn.  The style of the t-shirts is simplistic with an urban/modernized design.</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here's where you can help out and what you get (PERKS!)</h3>
<div>My goal is to raise $1500.  As mentioned in the video above, although I will be creating t-shirts and some training apparel for my own students, in order to launch my clothing line to the public, I will need some start-up capital that I simply don't have right now.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The funds I raise in this campaign would go directly to printing t-shirts, apparel and other accessories, which will be available for purchase on my website: <a href=""http://www.technicaladrenaline.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.technicaladrenaline.com</a>.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Funds from this campaign will go towards:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>- Paying for the shirts</div>
<div>- Paying for the screen printing</div>
<div>- Paying for the shipping </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Anything extra I make from my sales would go directly into producing more shirts and also hopefully hiring a designer to come up with some new/unique designs.  It would also go towards improving our website, since we have just a bare bones site right now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Anything you can donate is greatly appreciated, even just $1.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Thank you for your support!</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>

Hello my name is Kimberly Tanny and I am a martial arts and fitness instructor.  I have been training in the martial arts for 10 years and earned my 3rd degree black belt in ITF Taekwon-do last year in June 2011.  I own a small martial arts school in Aurora, CO where I teach Taekwon-do, fitness kickboxing and women's self defense.  I recently started a new program that is a fusion of traditional martial arts with modern martial arts (acrobatic techniques, powerful jumping/flying kicks and martial arts weapons).  In the quest to search for the perfect name for my new class and wanting to use the abbreviation of my martial arts school (TAMA), I came up with Technical Adrenaline Martial Arts.

The technical aspect fits because we focus on proper technique, making each kick, strike, block or stance as sharp and correct as possible.  The adrenaline comes from all the jumping and flying techniques or acrobatic moves.  It also comes from the adrenaline rush of competing in a tournament or demonstrating in front of a large crowd.  

The clothing line came about because I wanted my students to be able to wear our own logo t-shirts and training apparel.  Eventually I became stuck on the idea of turning Technical Adrenaline into a clothing line.  

Well, what makes Technical Adrenaline unique?  We're not just another t-shirt brand.  Technical Adrenaline represents a population of martial artists that is fairly large. There are millions and millions of martial artists practicing world wide, but there isn't a whole lot of basic martial arts street wear that exists, mainly just shirts and apparel for MMA, but not that other side of martial arts.  Technical Adrenaline's goal is to outfit these extreme martial artists and provide a way for them to truly express themselves all while looking stylish.  


My goal
My goal is to create a new t-shirt brand that represents modern martial artists (not just MMA).  I am hoping to create comfortable street wear that represents who these kids, teens and adults are.  Those who live and breathe martial arts and have that passion and drive to train, compete and learn.  The style of the t-shirts is simplistic with an urban/modernized design.


Here's where you can help out and what you get (PERKS!)
My goal is to raise $1500.  As mentioned in the video above, although I will be creating t-shirts and some training apparel for my own students, in order to launch my clothing line to the public, I will need some start-up capital that I simply don't have right now.  

The funds I raise in this campaign would go directly to printing t-shirts, apparel and other accessories, which will be available for purchase on my website: www.technicaladrenaline.com.  

Funds from this campaign will go towards:

- Paying for the shirts
- Paying for the screen printing
- Paying for the shipping 

Anything extra I make from my sales would go directly into producing more shirts and also hopefully hiring a designer to come up with some new/unique designs.  It would also go towards improving our website, since we have just a bare bones site right now.

Anything you can donate is greatly appreciated, even just $1.  

Thank you for your support!

I am now starting a new project called ""From the Black Lodge""<br/>and I need your help getting the project going.<br/><br/>""From the Black Lodge"" is a popup shop that travels to different venues around<br/>the world. We strongly believe in handmade, small batch, independent business. The shop will be filled with products from artists and designers that sell<br/>primarily on the internet. My goal in the creation of “From the Black Lodge” is to<br/>help these artist bring work to shoppers which they may not have had the chance<br/>to see, and will allow the shoppers to experience and appreciate a unique,<br/>specific style. I will also be giving the artists I represent an opportunity to share<br/>their efforts, and to spread the awareness of their craft without taking a huge<br/>financial risk on their own.<br/><br/><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong><br/><br/>To get the ball rolling, at the very least, I would need $4,000. This will directly go<br/>to the first venue, Austin Psych Fest, that will debut ""from the black lodge"". Psych<br/>Fest is a 3 day musical festival that draws up to 10,000 potential shoppers from<br/>all over the United States and the world.

I also know this barely leaves time to do the things that<br/>make us happy. At the end of the day it is difficult for a working artist to find the<br/>time that they need to promote themselves, so “From the Black Lodge” will take<br/>on this burden, bringing valuable art to the global community.<br/><br/>The artists I represent are just like you and I, and I want to see them succeed by<br/>promoting &amp; selling their goods in my new shop.<br/><br/>In the past, the community that Jewelry by Adelina Mictlan has been a part of<br/>has been very giving and supportive.

<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>For making
the XS-3 IP67 waterproof we will adopt the nanocoating technology. The internal

Exetech is the first manufacturer of Smart Watches introducing this solution. </p>

When it comes to the Operating System, the evolution process in EXETECH is a continuous challenge: the owners of the XS-3 will take advantage of the new releases, and, in the same way, the future owner of the XS-4 will be enabled to upgrade to the new versions. The research carried on by the EXETECH engineers is aimed to improve the ergonomy of the navigation system, to reduce the battery consumption and to introduce new features and new design in the screenshots. The XS-4 will surely be equipped with the brand new choice of built-in ""Exetech Chronographs"".

value-add compared to other market offerings. The XS-4 would include a 
much richer application experience that would provide the users with 
personalized usage analytics, inform them on how they are benefitting

The first Smart Watch-Phone by Exetech, the ""XS -3"", was officially presented at the SMAU exhibition in Milan in October 2013, and soon after, at the WEB-SUMMIT in Dublin (where EXETECH has been selected among the most innovative startups worldwide). The XS-3 is on the market since December 2013. The first production batch has been delivered in just one week!XS-4: THE NEW CHALLENGE by EXETECH In the ICT market there is never the possibility to rest, and so, since January 2014, Exetech is already working upon the new model, the ""XS-4"", that will come out in 2014.The ""XS-4"" will be an evolution of the XS-3 characterized by a smoother design and by a great deal of amazing new technical solutions. The aim of EXETECH, with no doubts, is to create, with the XS-4, a device with the potential to become a new landmark in the growing market of the Smart Watches.XS-4 HIGHLIGHTSDesign - by Synthesis DesignCompared with the XS-3, the XS-4 is a result of an evolution process aimed to obtain smoother surfaces without changing too much the initial ""concept"". The touch screen surface will become slightly curved, and the cover of the touch screen will be made in a single ""glass looking"" piece. Furthermore, the XS-4 will be WATER PROOF IP 67 certified. IP67 ""waterproof"" through nanocoating
technology
For making
the XS-3 IP67 waterproof we will adopt the nanocoating technology. The internal
and external surfaces of the device and of the battery will be coated by an
ultrathin fluoroplymer coating, so water and aother liquids will be repelled.
Exetech is the first manufacturer of Smart Watches introducing this solution. 
Operating System and SoftwareThe XS-4 will boast Android 4.4. When it comes to the Operating System, the evolution process in EXETECH is a continuous challenge: the owners of the XS-3 will take advantage of the new releases, and, in the same way, the future owner of the XS-4 will be enabled to upgrade to the new versions. The research carried on by the EXETECH engineers is aimed to improve the ergonomy of the navigation system, to reduce the battery consumption and to introduce new features and new design in the screenshots. The XS-4 will surely be equipped with the brand new choice of built-in ""Exetech Chronographs"". The software will include vocal commands.ConnectivityXS-4 will upgrade to 4GBatteryXS-4 will be equipped with an addictional 800 mah spare battery. The target is to obtain 48 hours of standby time and at least 15 hours with intense use of GPS and data connection.Solar charging systemXS-4 will be equipped with a technology that will transforms the screen into a solar panel that can generate its own electricity. The solar cells act as light receptors and transforms that light into electricity. This technology will help to recharge the battery and will improve the standby time.The touch screen of the XS-4 will be covered by a layer of solar cells especially designed for the SmartWatch application.CameraThe camera of the XS-4 will be 5.0 MPBLACK INDIEGOGO LIMITED EDITIONFeaturesThis is the complete list of the features of XS-4Connectivity4G3G    2G Operating system    Android 4.4DisplayAMOLEDTouch screen 1.54 ""Resolution: 240x240Processor    Model: MTK 6592 Memory    Int Memory : 2 Gb    Est Memory : Expandable with Micro SD up to 32 GBSize / Weight    Size (cm ) : Height 6.46 x Width 4.40 x Thickness 1.76  (case)    Weight: 66 grBattery    450 mah + Interchangeable spare battery 800 mahPhotovoltaic layer for battery chargingHousings underbody    Sim Card    Expansion Micro SD memory up to 32 GBType of call    Stand alone    Hands free    Wireless BluetoothAudio Video    MP3, Video 3GP/MP4Connectivity    WI-FI    BluetoothMessaging - Camera - applications    SMS / MMS , E-mail    CAMERA 5.0 MP    RecorderSensors    GPS    G sensorWater Resistance    Water Proof (IP 67)Vocal CommandsCertifications    CE - FCC - ROHS

XS-4 Prototype - 1st stage - 4/6/14Find here below the first picture of the 1st stage prototype of the XS-4. We have already used the new touch screen with curved surface (you can appreciate its remarkable luminosity!), and the new processor MTK6592. We are currently carrying on the debugging of the version 4.2.2 of Android (intermediate step before skipping to the final version for the XS-4 that will be Android 4.4) Unfortunately our funding campaign is still so slow....we hope that this news will help people to give us some more trust!Note: the materials and the colours of this prototype are not definitive..it's made with prototyping techniques!FUNDRAISING AIMThe aim of the fundraising will be to finance the manufacturing of the new dies that are necessary to produce the XS-4. Furthermore, the fundraising will help to produce the first batch of XS-4. We can warrant the delivery of the XS-4 within November 2014.Analytics Cloud Service NEW - IF WE REACH AT LEAST 20,000 EUROSIf we reach at least 20.000 Euros, the XS-4 smart watch will be powered by a smart data and analytics 
cloud service. The cloud platform will gather XS-4 usage data and 
transform it into user analytics and insights – a unique and key 
value-add compared to other market offerings. The XS-4 would include a 
much richer application experience that would provide the users with 
personalized usage analytics, inform them on how they are benefitting 
from the XS-4 smart watch, and  enable them to share their data with 
other users. Moreover, users will be able to share the XS-4 smart watch 
with friends and family and still enjoy a personalized experience.THEY TALK ABOUT EXETECHhttp://smartwatches.org/crowdfunding/exetech-xs-4-solid-investment/http://www.engadget.com/2014/04/24/exetech-xs-4-re-launch-indiegogo/?ncid=rss_truncatedhttp://noticias.terra.es/exetech-xs-4-el-reloj-que-tambien-es-telefono,9ed9134b69395410VgnVCM20000099cceb0aRCRD.htmlhttp://www.androidheadlines.com/2014/04/exetech-turns-indie-gogo-help-new-smartwatch-xs-4.htmlhttp://www.engadget.com/2014/03/11/exetech-xs-3-smartwatch-hands-on/http://www.morningledger.com/exetech-xs-3-is-the-new-italian-made-standalone-smartwatch/135544/http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2013/11/02/2014-will-be-the-year-of-wearable-technology/http://www.telecomasia.net/content/2014-nomophobia-and-device-debutanteshttp://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/18152/1/best-top-ten-wearable-tech-inventionshttp://www.vitadasmartphone.it/smartwatch-quale-scegliere/  http://www.androidsmartwatch.net/xs-3-smart-watchhttp://multimedia.quotidiano.net/video/cronaca/smau-2013-le-migliori-innovazioni-in-mostra-gi-52283TECH BLOG FB PageMany articles and reviews published all over the world.

</div><p> </p></div>","I have to admit that it was somewhat daunting at first to design a watch to succeed our current SQ38 Plano, due to its universal appeal and debonair balance between elegance and modernity. In the end however I decided that the best way to follow up was simply to keep the soul intact, but give it a body and character all its own.Novem, Latin for the number 9 refers here to the 9 phases of the moon, but has been an auspicious digit in the history of many ancient cultures. It also traditionally represents the limit or ultimate attainment, as it is the last number in the base 10 system.The geometries of Novem's case and detailing draw inspiration from a wide variety of sources, but one stands out in particular. The Hallwyl Museum in Stockholm. Both Palace and practical residence at once, with sweeping eccentric forms as well as sharp geometries. It embodies both the classic turn of the century elegance along with many technically advanced, and for it's time, futuristic features such as telephone, electricity and central heating.Now since this campaign is running InDemand, after successful funding on Kickstarter, it does already come with some pretty amazing add-ons for everyone. Starting at the top there's the FREE strap & battery change when you need it, then at the 500% mark we added a double layer of AR coating on the inside of the lens to remove unwanted reflections, and lastly, not too long ago actually, the final 50 backers unlocked the FREE Suplon Summer strap (seen here below). So in order to get to the, eh... bottom of this, we need your help! Let's reach 1300% so that I can finally make those screen printed initials!Suplon Summer Straps come Flax, Navy, Black, Cognac & Army. It's basically the replacement for both and NATO. A shape knitted Nylon wristband made on the same type of machine as those lightweight sneakers on your feet. Washable, breathable, super adjustable, hypoallergenic & comfortable. What more do you want!? Developed completely in-house here at squarestreet. No one else has this, unless they copied us. Anyway, without further ado, here it is. Asymmetric case, hidden pushers, true sapphire crystal lens, custom moon phase and a look all its own.

Alice Alexander is a size-inclusive, ethically-made women’s apparel company. We’ve launched this crowdfunding campaign to fund the next stage of growth in our development! We’re seeking funding to grow our company, expand our reach and open our combined brick and mortar shop/ production studio in Philadelphia.</p><p>As a plus-size consumer myself so much of what’s available in my size is either cheap, flimsy, fast-fashion or oversized boxy silhouettes in muted colors—definitely not my style. Furthermore finding garments that were ethically-made and of natural materials felt impossible. I started sewing my own clothes and fell in love (and became just a wee bit obsessed). Simultaneously, I enrolled in design school while working full-time.</p><p>We launched our company in September 2017 with a small collection for sizes 12-28. <a href=""https://alicealexander.co/blogs/news/why-we-made-the-jump-from-plus-size-to-size-inclusive"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">With our newest collection we’ve expanded our size range to be truly size-inclusive including sizes 0-28</a>. And our promise to you is that if our size chart doesn’t work for your body, that’s on us, and we’ll make something just for you at no additional cost. </p><p>Unlike most clothing companies, we design, manufacture and retail 100% of our garments. No outsourcing and no wholesale means we’re able to provide a truly superior garment made of natural fibers and constructed using high end finishes at a fair price. It also allows us to build a relationship with our customer, inviting them into our process and cultivating an appreciation for slowed-down fashion. </p><p>Campaign contributors will help us bring our message of size-inclusive, ethically-made women’s apparel to the world! <i><strong>We’re offering a variety of perks to backers including 30% off our entire warm weather collection through pre-order.</strong></i>  Pre-ordering allows us to control our costs by only ordering bulk fabric and producing garments after they’ve been purchased by the consumer.

Depending on the resistance of the material, it creates a current which behaves just like in traditional electromagnets: produces an additional magnetic field. Lenz’s law states that the magnetic field created by this induced current is so directed as to oppose the change in the source flux. To put it more simply, if you create a changing magnetic field by moving a magnet, it will produce a mechanical force trying to slow down the motion. The faster you move, the stronger the force gets.

<li><p>Avoid the magnet getting close to sensitive devices especially measurement instruments, precise mechanical clocks/watches, hard disk drives, displays or any electronic devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Neodymium magnets are fragile, and may shatter on high impact. Make sure you play above soft surfaces away from other magnets and attractable objects. Learn more about fragility in the FAQ.</p></li>

There you see the default contribution value, which can be modified. Just rewrite that number to the one that includes the shipping price (+$20 for most cases) and you're done.<br/><br/></p><p><b>Q.: Does EU shipping mean the continent, or the European Union?</b></p><p>A: Free shipping includes all european countries, even those outside the EU. So it’s free for Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Iceland, and for Eastern Europe as well.<br/><br/></p><p><b>Q: You only give one magnet ball in each reward. Why? Can I get more?</b></p><p>A: We only give one ball for each set, because two of these super-strong neodymium magnets would be capable of producing so strong attractions that would make the set more dangerous. Even one ball requires very careful attention while playing, but we have found this level of risk well below the threshold of being considered as potentially dangerous if you keep the few restrictions in mind. However, handling two balls exceeds this threshold, the two balls can perform a very high speed collision even if careful attention was payed. If you completely understand the potential risk of multiple balls and still want to get more, contact us and we’ll discuss it.</p><br/><p><b>Q: What if I forgot to add the shipping cost?</b></p><p>A: If you forgot to add the cost of international shipping to your perk, you can do it by placing another perk of donation in the same value. In this case please send us a mail to inform us about the separately placed contributions. If you don’t realize you forgot adding the money, we’ll send you a PayPal invoice so you can refund the difference. If you refuse to pay for the shipping, you can chose to set an EU or US address, or get your money back, but in the latter case the Indiegogo and PayPal transaction fees will be discounted.<br/><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><br/></b></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b>Q: Are the tubes getting deformed throughout the practice?</b></span></p><p>A: Skill Flux is made for performing great tricks which comes with numerous high impacts with the ball. For aluminum and copper are being relatively soft metals, the powerful impacts may leave small dots on the surface of the Flux. At just a few dots it could look like damage, but hard-core fluxers will soon have tubes continuously covered with ball marks, which lead to an even more unique and just as beautiful surface. For this we say Flux doesn't get damaged, it matures.</p><p><b>Q: Neodymium magnets are known to be fragile, how about that?</b></p><p>A: Yes, Nd magnets are usually fragile and capable of cracking and chipping. However, the spherical form of the ball makes the magnet durable and less likely to crack. We had numerous drops on concrete and ceramic floor, we even collided two balls several times and still experienced no breaks. But this does not mean that the balls can't crack, be very cautious all the time and avoid dropping the ball on hard surfaces. Play above grass or carpet or anything soft. While you shouldn't expect instant breaks, the coating of the ball is likely to get damaged and that's something you don't want.</p><p><b>Q: Does the copper tube gets oxidized?</b></p><p>A: Yes. It is made of pure copper and behaves accordingly. We did not find any suitable coating that preserves the shiny finish of the freshly turned copper and proves to be durable enough for the ball impacts. As soon as we find out anything useful, we'll let you know and you can decide to take the coating or not. However, many people liked the matte surface better, it also goes well with the leather cover.</p><p></p><p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#top"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Back to the top</a><br/></p></div>","The science | Design | Which one is You? | Tricks | Leather designs | The ball | Why Indiegogo? | Shipping | Perks detailed | FAQDear Friends,Feel Flux is now available again via Indiegogo's InDemand service and our new online store as well.

The magnet can produce extremely high acceleration to magnetizable objects or other magnets. This can cause high speed impacts thus injuries.
Do not put the magnet close to any medical appliances, especially a pacemaker or metal implants.
Avoid the magnet getting close to sensitive devices especially measurement instruments, precise mechanical clocks/watches, hard disk drives, displays or any electronic devices.
Neodymium magnets are fragile, and may shatter on high impact. Make sure you play above soft surfaces away from other magnets and attractable objects. Learn more about fragility in the FAQ.
Never give the magnet to a child without adult supervision.
Never give the magnet to anyone who is not informed about the aforementioned rules.
PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INJURIES OR DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE MAGNET

Why Indiegogo?
We’re a team of industrial designers and engineers with a dream of delivering a magical law of physics into the palm of those who would admire it. We have the passion and the expertise to execute this project, all we lack is the financial background. So that’s where Indiegogo and you guys come into the picture.We’ve built up a supply chain for the metal tubes and the magnets, we have partners who are ready to do the CNC lathing and the leather-work, and we even haggled the most competitive worldwide shipping prices available. All we need now is you and your contributions to bring our well planned process to life and deliver this extraordinary product to the world. To express our gratitude we will get the first FLUXes ever created right into your hands. Moreover we guarantee that you won’t believe your eyes and that is one tough promise to keep.Back to the topShippingEvery perk includes FREE SHIPPING to the US, Canada and Europe including countries outside of the European Union.Back to the topPerks detailedBack to the topFAQQ: How can I specify the leather color and the desktop stand design?A: After the campaign has been finished successfully, we’ll send you an email asking about your preferences in leather color and desktop stand variations.Q: How can I add the price of the shipping to my perk?A: Once you've selected your perk, you are asked to set the amount of the contribution. There you see the default contribution value, which can be modified. Just rewrite that number to the one that includes the shipping price (+$20 for most cases) and you're done.Q.: Does EU shipping mean the continent, or the European Union?A: Free shipping includes all european countries, even those outside the EU. So it’s free for Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Iceland, and for Eastern Europe as well.Q: You only give one magnet ball in each reward. Why? Can I get more?A: We only give one ball for each set, because two of these super-strong neodymium magnets would be capable of producing so strong attractions that would make the set more dangerous. Even one ball requires very careful attention while playing, but we have found this level of risk well below the threshold of being considered as potentially dangerous if you keep the few restrictions in mind. However, handling two balls exceeds this threshold, the two balls can perform a very high speed collision even if careful attention was payed. If you completely understand the potential risk of multiple balls and still want to get more, contact us and we’ll discuss it.Q: What if I forgot to add the shipping cost?A: If you forgot to add the cost of international shipping to your perk, you can do it by placing another perk of donation in the same value. In this case please send us a mail to inform us about the separately placed contributions. If you don’t realize you forgot adding the money, we’ll send you a PayPal invoice so you can refund the difference. If you refuse to pay for the shipping, you can chose to set an EU or US address, or get your money back, but in the latter case the Indiegogo and PayPal transaction fees will be discounted.Q: Are the tubes getting deformed throughout the practice?A: Skill Flux is made for performing great tricks which comes with numerous high impacts with the ball. For aluminum and copper are being relatively soft metals, the powerful impacts may leave small dots on the surface of the Flux. At just a few dots it could look like damage, but hard-core fluxers will soon have tubes continuously covered with ball marks, which lead to an even more unique and just as beautiful surface. For this we say Flux doesn't get damaged, it matures.Q: Neodymium magnets are known to be fragile, how about that?A: Yes, Nd magnets are usually fragile and capable of cracking and chipping. However, the spherical form of the ball makes the magnet durable and less likely to crack. We had numerous drops on concrete and ceramic floor, we even collided two balls several times and still experienced no breaks. But this does not mean that the balls can't crack, be very cautious all the time and avoid dropping the ball on hard surfaces. Play above grass or carpet or anything soft. While you shouldn't expect instant breaks, the coating of the ball is likely to get damaged and that's something you don't want.Q: Does the copper tube gets oxidized?A: Yes. It is made of pure copper and behaves accordingly. We did not find any suitable coating that preserves the shiny finish of the freshly turned copper and proves to be durable enough for the ball impacts. As soon as we find out anything useful, we'll let you know and you can decide to take the coating or not. However, many people liked the matte surface better, it also goes well with the leather cover.Back to the top",17.0,1,"1 Campaign

My name is Jules De Jesus Fritz and I have been a makeup artist for 17 years. I have spent the past 7 years as the creative mind and heart behind Dollface by Jules in Savannah, Georgia. I make women look and feel gorgeous, whether on their wedding day or on the catwalk. My work and I have been featured in print in South Magazine, Do Savannah, and Savannah Magazine, and online on Wall Street Journal, Simply Stine, and Travels with Minis, Shop My Savannah, and on TV with WTOC, Paula Deen Network, and Entertainment Tonight. But, before all that, I was a counter girl. That job required me to push products that clients didn’t need and that I didn’t believe in. Having to do that hurt, and I knew that in the future, I wanted to do everything I could to give clear, honest advice and develop products both you and I can trust.I have had over a thousand women sit in my chair and talk to me about their concerns. You wish you knew exactly what to use and how. You wish you had a makeup artist in your pocket who understands your needs.I am that makeup artist, I hear you, and I want to help you.My missionMy mission is to connect and engage with clients, helping them to think like a makeup artist with simplified products and education.I understand the concerns of the busy bee and the mom -- I am both! You’re loaded down with tasks but you still want to look and feel good. It’s so important to invest whatever time you can in yourself to accomplish that, but with the sea of products out there, it gets overwhelming and confusing. I don’t want you to waste what little, precious time you have. I designed products that you can trust to look great on you. I wiped away stress by composing the palettes with colors that work seamlessly together, on truly anyone. And, these products are so high quality, you can even dance in the rain with them. Look, I proved it!

But great products aren’t enough. That’s why I teach you step by step how to use every product so you can create looks you’ll feel confident in.

Why I need you
Dollface and More than Makeup are both completely homegrown brands. My husband Josh and I have been putting in the hours and passion to the Jules brands, even from within our own home. In fact, Josh has been applying the labels to our products himself in our kitchen!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kathryn Paterwic and I am a Fashion Designer based out of CT. I mainly design Steampunk fashion but have also been know to wander into the realms of Pin Up, Goth, Lolita, Punk, Renaissance wear and Historical Reenactments. I have been seen at fashion shows as far west and Teslacon in WI (where I was the featured Designer) and Steampunk Worlds Fair in NJ and as close as TempleCon in RI. I have been popular fashion books: Anatomy of Steampunk and 1001 cosplay creation to name just a few and have had the honor of being asked to be the keynote speak for a meeting of the Costumers Association of America where we discussed retrofuturisim.</p>
<p>I am looking to raise money to get us to another convention, normally I make it on my own but due to circumstances beyond my control I can’t do it alone this time. This convention is literally what I do and will open us up to a bigger and more influential market (NYC). It will also get us more exposure outside the Steampunk Community, and allow me to sell of my accumulated stock built over the course of the past year. </p>

that has already happened and not for me to get a table to sell at but for
things like Gas, food, and most important a hotel room. I am looking at getting
a suite (not a fancy one, more like to rooms one with a bed and one with a pull
out couch) at a hotel for my assistant, myself and for more importantly for the
models and hair and makeup to make sure they have a place to stay incase we get
out really late. I want my best foot forward on this so I am recruiting my best
girls (which are also all volunteers) who happen to be from MA and RI, My hair
and make up are also from RI.<span style="""">  </span>I am
not sure how many people it will end up being, but it could range from 3 to 6.

Redfield designs to RuffleCon whether it is a tank of gas or a hotel room. </p>

Compatibility


You can connect your SHAMMANE Smartwatch to your iPhone (iOS7+) or your Android Phone (4+).










The watch in a few words

A smartwatch is at the edge of jewelry and technology, is not a smartphone nor a computer. Its emotional dimension is much stronger, it is an object in contact with our own skin. We design our watch so it adapts to our lifestyles and wardrobes. We made it user-friendly, beautiful, pure and elegant.

The Shammane smartwatch case is made
from polished rose gold-plated aluminium that looks great with any outfit
. 
Your writs are tiny? The diameter of 39mm and the
size of our straps (18mm) make our watch designed for any size of wrists. 


Men and women can wear a SHAMMANE smartwatch.


Functions : how smart is the watch ?
Life is complicated. Your watch shouldn’t be. 
The SHAMMANE Smartwatch sit comfortably at the intersection between daily life and the digital world.



We’ve kept it simple - focusing on the essential features of a smartwatch:  you will be able to see a number of different notifications, like texts, calendar reminders, incoming calls and instant messages from applications installed on your smartphone.

For the healthy part, the watch has a pedometer to track your steps and efforts.

PHONE NOTIFICATIONS


Thanks to a Bluetooth 4.0 technology, the watch alerts you (sound alert or vibration) when you receive a notification. It can be a call, a text message or a Facebook Messenger. You also have the ability to display all the
notifications from your phone. Messages are displayed on our 1.22-inch LCD touch screen display (240x240 pixel resolution).



Customize which alert have to be pushed from your smartphone using our dedicated APP (available on Google Play and Apple app store).






PEDOMETER
Beyond looking nice and being simple, the watch does not forget to track your physical activity. We included a pedometer to track your steps. The watch will allow you to set daily goals and inform you about your progress, achievements.



EASY WATCH SETUP

Setup directly from your watch basics like brightness, bluetooth activation, switch to vibration/sound alert...


SWAP TO SEE MESSAGES & ALERTS
Messages, alerts, calendar notifications will be pushed to your smartwatch : scroll through the notifications to see them. 
Our current UI (User Interface) is pure and simple so you can read clearly your messages without being distracted by anything else.




Each moment its strap

Having a collection of straps means the SHAMMANE Smartwatch adapts to your life : choose your straps to fit your mood and your style.




Change your straps in 5 seconds
The straps are using a ""flash system,"" which means the bands have a quick release mechanism.

Straps in details






Drawing its inspiration from the
idea of shamanism, you can choose between 6 interchangeable, stylish bands so
you can keep your look unique fresh, and smart everyday. 
The bands come in 3 collection packs of 2
colors for the Indiegogo campaign. Our idea will be to launch one new
collection per year that will be designed based on a theme linked to shamanism
and the latest trendy fabrics and colors, like a fashion collection.
""Working like you need a smart watch to, the
Shammane Smartwatch offers all the functionality you'll expect but with a slew
of awesome colors and styles of bands to choose from to make it uniquely your
ownChangeable Bands Make Shammane a Watch You Want to Wear

dedicated to fine, vintage mechanical movements.  
We are in the watch and jewelry business for almost 20 years now! We 
just love the ticking beauties, so we decided, to save at least 300 pieces of vintage 
mechanical movements for the future generation by making fine accessories out of them, and establish a brand around this new collection! That is why we need your support! Gergo is at work in the office (designing watch cases with autocad)We usually build watch cases for huge caseless pocket watch movements, you can find some of our previous projects on our website (www.rebornoflegends.com) and on this site also. We used to produce tiny accessories for men also, but now we would like to launch an exclusive series of silver and gold accessories.Beside our main goal which is saving mechanical movements for the future, we also would like to focus the attention of the modern people for the importance of fine craftmanship combining with the latest technology. (autocad designing process, using cnc lathes in certain cases)Crafting a case for a pocketwatch movement. (drilling the hole for the stem)We would like to launch a collection of exclusive accessories and build a brand around it. It would be called ""Mechanical Movement Dream"", and we would also sell these pieces worldwide under the brand name. This collection will include cufflinks, cigar cases, pins, keychains, and even pendants made of silver and gold. Certainly all pieces will consist genuine, tiny mechanical movements, like our previous pieces. (see pictures and videos below) CIGAR TUBE in sterling silver, with a ""Mechanical Movement Dream"" cap.CIGAR TUBE in sterling silver, with a ""Mechanical Movement Dream"" cap.

The logo of the owner was engraved on the glass.""Mechanical Movement Dream"" sterling silver cufflinks.During this campaign we would like to collect enough money to purchase at least 300 vintage mechanical movements from collectors worldwide. Certainly we also would like to establish a brand around the collection we produce, and in the future sell our products in retailer shops worldwide. We would save as many vintage, caseless mechanical movements as possible. With the collection you support to create, we not only would make sophisticated accessories and high-end timepieces, but we would also save a lot of vintage mechanical movements for the next generation. Crafting a new stem in the workshop for a vintage mechanical movement. A vintage high end mechanical movement in a stainless steel case made by our workshop. This is a really important task for us, as it is very important, that the future generation meet and understand the beauty of high grade mechanical movements. By this way, we could make the world a better place, where people give respect for the hard work, and skilled craftsmen. What We Need & What You Get5000 USD - We will be able to purchase 100 tiny antique movements and launch the collection.15000 USD - We will be able to purchase as much as 300 pieces of tiny antique movements. It could be possible, not only to launch a collection of unique accessories, but to establish the brand, called ""Mechanical Dream"". It could be also possible to start the exclusive website dedicated to the ""Mechanical Movement Dream"" brand. We will be able to create installations, stands, and other gadgets, to exhibit the collection in shop windows.25000 USD - We will be able to purchase not only tiny movements and establish the brand "" Mechanical Movement Dream"" see above, but we will be able to puchase at least 20 pieces of fine antique pocket watch movements, for this ammount of funding. Out of these movements we will make a wristwatch collection and start saving pocket watch movements also.We are very happy, if  you support our project to save as many vintage mechanical movements, as we can.

<p>Our team has worked really hard to feature all the greatest daily used products around the world to our readers. The EO-2 project is the actual realization of an ideal daily gadget to us.</p>
<h1>IS THERE AN EO-1?</h1>
<p>At 2012, we’ve launched a project called the ""Hybrid Pilot Watch"" at Taipei, where our business was founded.</p>
<p>We only made a limited amount of them and had no idea that people would like it or not. Surprisingly, the hybrid watch project later turned out to be quite a hit.</p>
<p>All the watches were literally sold out within hours. And there are demands from all over the globe, asking us to make some more of them. Despite of a really good start, we had to start working on other projects for our business, the watch project just sort of got discontinued at that moment, until this year.</p>

The minimal design of pilot watches during the 1940’s is something that we really appreciate, it takes the least effort to read, no matter of what angle, light source or condition. The design later becomes our inspiration of making the EO-2.
The EO-2 is simply enjoyable, in terms of user experience.
 
 
 
 
NO MORE BATTERY CHANGE, ALL POWERED BY YOU.
 
 
We have always been fascinated by the mechanism of a automatic watch.
However, that being said, automatic movements haven’t been the most accurate way to tell time, it requires re-adjustment and cleaning from time to time in order to maintain its best condition.
For the EO-2, we like to combine the advantages of both automatic and quartz movements, which are no need for battery change and time accuracy.
 
 
The EO-2 is powered by a Japanese movement designed by SEIKO EPSON. It is a self-powered quartz movement, it doesn’t require battery changes. The EO-2 has a small mechanism on the back of the movement that spins around when you move. As it spins, it generates an electrical charge which is stored by an internal capacitor.
After the movement is fully charged, power reserve is up to 6 months.
The EO-2 will always be on time, yet there’s no need for battery changing anymore.
3 PREMIUM NATO STRAPS ( ALL INCLUDED )
 
 
All the EO-2 watches come with 3 premium nato straps. The Classic Brown-- for Silver Edition / The Classic Black-- for Black Editions, The Suede and The Nylon.
The Classic Brown and The Classic Black are both made of hand picked premium leather from Italy.
 
 
The most appealing part of a nato strap is that everyone can exchange and install straps instantly, no tools of any kind is required whatsoever.
We've also have extra holes made on the straps so that they stay fit on all sizes of wrists. ( For both men & women )
 
You will be really amazed that how you can shift style just by changing the strap of your EO-2, the 3 included premium straps enable the EO-2 to match all kinds of outfits and style.

SUPPLIERS & MANUFACTURERS
 
 
 
 
All our chosen suppliers and manufacturers from Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, Italy and China are experienced and reputable in their professional fields. They have all work with top brands that you might heard of, and will maintain the same quality and craftsmanship while producing the EO-2.
BEHIND THE EO-2
 
 
EVERYDAY OBJECT is a design and fashion blog based in Taipei, Taiwan. We have become one of the most popular and influential fashion media in Asia for the past few years.  We've launched our online store at 2013, where you can find everyday objects selected by our staff.
Our team has worked really hard to feature all the greatest daily used products around the world to our readers. The EO-2 project is the actual realization of an ideal daily gadget to us.
IS THERE AN EO-1?
At 2012, we’ve launched a project called the ""Hybrid Pilot Watch"" at Taipei, where our business was founded.
We only made a limited amount of them and had no idea that people would like it or not. Surprisingly, the hybrid watch project later turned out to be quite a hit.
All the watches were literally sold out within hours. And there are demands from all over the globe, asking us to make some more of them. Despite of a really good start, we had to start working on other projects for our business, the watch project just sort of got discontinued at that moment, until this year.

<p>To make the Micro wallet a bit safer we are giving our backers the opportunity to purchase our minimal RFID blocker card to reduce the risk of their cards being skimmed! Simply place one card on top of your micro to add some hefty protection. Designed to be the same thickness and size as a regular card, the Micro Shield can also be used in regular wallets.</p>
<p>This being said it is almost impossible to 100% block RFID signals and there is always a chance that a theft may occur... Because of this, we have teamed up with a company offering a state of the art RFID blocking foil.  We currently have prototypes being tested at their headquarters in Europe and will update with video proof of its blocking power.</p>

<p>Increase flight time or safety of the power supply in drones and UAVs by using multiple batteries. However it is dangerous to just hook up these batteries in parallel. If the batteries are not perfectly identical in type and charge level, the battery with higher charge will attempt to charge the other battery. As the charge current is not limited, it can become very high. A potential danger for the user and his equipment.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Diode OR</h3>For protection the batteries should be connected with diodes, to avoid any back current into the 2 batteries. The disadvantage is a significant voltage drop in the diodes. Typically this is 0.5V to 1V. At 100A 50 to 100 watts is dissipated in the diode. <p></p>
<h3>Ideal Diode</h3>
An ideal diode is a diode with no voltage drop and therefore no power loss. As this is physically impossible we can come close by using a state of the art power MOSFET as diode replacement. The resistance can be as low was 0.55 milliOhm. At 100A the voltage drop is only 55 mV. 10 to 20 times better than a regular diode. To operate as a diode, the MOSFET is controlled by a special power controller. It monitors the current flow through the MOSFET and immediately turns it off, if it detects that the current is starting to flow backwards. This emulates the operation of a diode.</div><div>

The email will contain a clear and elaborate size chart to make sure you select the right size. We send out this email every two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I have a request for a bulk order, who can I reach out to?</strong><br/>A: You can send us a personal message on the IGG platform or email us on hello@labfresh.eu and mention that you saw us on IGG and are interested in placing a bulk order. We can add a new, personalized perk according to your interests. <br/><br/><strong>Q: What sizes are the models wearing and what is their height?</strong><br/>A: Grey: Medium, 1,86m and 84kg | White: Large, 1,89m and 78kg | Black: Medium, 1,80m and 74kg</p>
<p><strong>Q: If I order my LABFRESH t-shirts through Indiegogo, when will I get them?</strong><br/>A: You will receive the t-shirts August the latest. You will be updated during the whole process and we will be available to answer all your questions.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will the unique stain repellent and odour-free features of the LABFRESH t-shirt last forever?</strong> <br/>A: We guarantee that the t-shirt will hold its unique features up to 50 washes, when care instructions are followed.</p>
<p>But the main take out here is: wear more, wash less, buy less.</p>
<p>The less you wash the t-shirt the longer it will last. The silver particles that are woven into the yarn kill all bacteria, keeping the t-shirt clean and fresh and allowing you to wear it for more days than traditional t-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Q: If the t-shirt doesn't get wet how do I wash it?</strong><br/>A: You can wash the t-shirt in the same way as your other t-shirt. Because of the huge amounts of water and water pressure in the machine the t-shirt will still get wet. The t-shirt is not 100% hydrophobic and can get wet. If it would be 100% hydrophobic it will feel like a rain jacket and will lose the natural look and feel.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How is this different from all the nano sprays and coatings?</strong><br/>A: A couple of things: <br/>- Nano sprays often have quite strong and harmful chemicals. <br/>- Our technology is pressed deeply into the fibers of the fabric. Because of this the technology also last for many washes.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How is it possible that the t-shirt is breathable?</strong><br/>A: The t-shirt is just as breathable as any other t-shirt. The technology is pressed into the yarns and doesn't seal off the whole fabric, only the yarns. Air can still go through the fabric even if water can't.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are you ever gonna make t-shirts for women?</strong><br/>A: Never say never but it's not in the plan for now. As a young startup, you need to focus. <br/>The t-shirts can of course be worn by women. If you are ok with a loose/normal fit then we recommend taking one size smaller than your usual size.</p>

Sweat stains are not visible and you stay dry even in the most humid climates.Engineered to make life easier - without compromising on style and comfort.  We use a unique combination of 3 of the most innovative textile technologies - something which has never been done before in a 100% cotton product.  On the outside our t-shirts are hydrophobic. This means that they repel liquids and semi-liquids. Even serious spills like red wine or beetroot juice can easily be rinsed off with water. We added natural silver particles to the yarn, which kills the odour-causing bacteria in your sweat. The inside absorbs and wicks away moisture, automatically spreading your sweat across a larger surface and towards the exterior of the cotton, making it easy to evaporate through the fabric. Moisture wicking also makes the fabric breathable and fast-drying.Visible sweat stains become a thing of the past - even in a grey t-shirt. Our mill in Portugal only uses 100% soft long-staple 180 g/m2 cotton with a high tear resistance.Our t-shirt is the perfect marriage between style and performance.

We can add a new, personalized perk according to your interests. Q: What sizes are the models wearing and what is their height?A: Grey: Medium, 1,86m and 84kg | White: Large, 1,89m and 78kg | Black: Medium, 1,80m and 74kg
Q: If I order my LABFRESH t-shirts through Indiegogo, when will I get them?A: You will receive the t-shirts August the latest. You will be updated during the whole process and we will be available to answer all your questions.
Q: Will the unique stain repellent and odour-free features of the LABFRESH t-shirt last forever? A: We guarantee that the t-shirt will hold its unique features up to 50 washes, when care instructions are followed.
But the main take out here is: wear more, wash less, buy less.
The less you wash the t-shirt the longer it will last. The silver particles that are woven into the yarn kill all bacteria, keeping the t-shirt clean and fresh and allowing you to wear it for more days than traditional t-shirt.
Q: If the t-shirt doesn't get wet how do I wash it?A: You can wash the t-shirt in the same way as your other t-shirt. Because of the huge amounts of water and water pressure in the machine the t-shirt will still get wet. The t-shirt is not 100% hydrophobic and can get wet. If it would be 100% hydrophobic it will feel like a rain jacket and will lose the natural look and feel.
Q: How is this different from all the nano sprays and coatings?A: A couple of things: - Nano sprays often have quite strong and harmful chemicals. - Our technology is pressed deeply into the fibers of the fabric. Because of this the technology also last for many washes.
Q: How is it possible that the t-shirt is breathable?A: The t-shirt is just as breathable as any other t-shirt. The technology is pressed into the yarns and doesn't seal off the whole fabric, only the yarns. Air can still go through the fabric even if water can't.
Q: Are you ever gonna make t-shirts for women?A: Never say never but it's not in the plan for now. As a young startup, you need to focus. The t-shirts can of course be worn by women. If you are ok with a loose/normal fit then we recommend taking one size smaller than your usual size.
           Unlimited cancellation. You are able to cancel your order at any point of time and get a full refund.90 days size guarantee. If your size is wrong we send you a new shirt in the right size free of charge (we do not provide free return labels).Free and easy shipping across the EU, US & Canada. Shipping costs to other parts of the world is only €15.This campaign has been promoted by Backercamp. Since 2012, Backercamp has helped over 5,000 creators make their projects a reality.LABFRESH is fashion, not sportswear. You might be able to run a marathon in it without smelling, but that is not what our products are intended for.With regards to stains we have been able to wash off any liquids and semi-liquids with water. However if you rub a substance into the fabric with force or if a very oily sauce comes in contact with the fabric, it will eventually make a slightly visible stain. You'll have to put it in the washer at 30 degrees to get the stain off.Production delays and unforeseen obstacles are always a risk. This is however not our first rodeo and we know our factory and mill well. We are very happy with the 35 perfect prototypes we had so far, and we are confident they will be punctual.",40.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3 class=""notranslate""><strong>A BIT ABOUT ME...</strong></h3>
<p>I was born and raised in the East New York section of Brooklyn, NY. When I was a little girl, I went rummaging thru the closet one day and came across a black portfolio case which held my mother's fashion sketches from during her time attending The High School of Fashion Industries. My mother never got to finish there because she became pregnant with me, and had to get right to work to support me. She's been working ever since to support the family...</p>
<p>While browsing her sketches, I knew instantly I wanted to learn how to do the same <em>exact</em> thing. For years after that, I would always boast to my lil friends and everyone that asked what I wanted to do when I grow up - <em>""Yea I'm goin' to the high school of fashion industries""...</em></p>
<p>It's like I never thought twice about it. It was an immediate LOVE, and till this day, I can't imagine anything else I'd rather do, than create.</p>
<p>During my years in high school I remained involved in every extra curricular activity I could maintain, and entering design contests when they presented opportunities. One in particular I remember, was catered to spandex. I always gravitated to stretch fabrics because of the flexibility, and I preferred  bright colors because it gets noticed. I figured getting noticed and being comfortable at the same time was a woman's dream. So I began to build on that idea.</p>
<h2><strong>It’s all in a name… ""BUTCH DIVA""</strong></h2>
<p>In 2002, while deciding what I wanted to call my brand, I brainstormed an expression that described the ideal woman I wanted to design for<strong>.</strong> I thought ""butch"" was an expression of androgyny, boldness, masculine aggression, and a tough edge, and ""diva"" was still sexy, feminine, boss, and in control. So I mashed the concepts and stood confident behind ""BUTCH DIVA"".</p>
<p>I've always catered to custom pieces, as I value the fulfillment that comes from being original, individual, and unique. Almost 2 years ago, I launched an online shop, which made Butch Diva available all over the world!</p>
<p>I've built BUTCH DIVA from the ground up, ONE stitch at a time! Naturally the biggest challenge is DOING IT ALLLLLL ALONE. I'm currently responsible for all the designing, patternmaking, cutting, sewing, fitting, blogging, maintaining online shop, meetings, follow ups, photography &amp; editing, marketing &amp; advertising...the list goes on &amp; on. but yessss all of that - I do alone, for the love of BUTCH DIVA.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, BUTCH DIVA has produced well over 5000 custom pieces for customers initially in New York and then spreading all around the world! Australia, Canada, London, Paris, New Zealand, Japan.. to Miami, LA, Atlanta.. to the Carribeans, Trinidad, Jamaica, Cape Town and beyond!</p>
<p>It’s time to open a flagship store in New York...in Brooklyn!</p>
<h3><strong>INDUSTRY BACKGROUND...</strong></h3>
<p>I studied at the famous Fashion Institute of Technology. Throughout college, I was able to land some pretty rad positions in the industry. I always utilized the career office, and recruiting agencies. Some of my experience includes Visual Merchandising for Sean John, Quality Control for TSE, coordinating Production for Catherine Malandrino, Alice &amp; Olivia, American Eagle, and Fabric Development for Ralph Lauren. I've learned so much and gained amazing resources from my time with these companies. The process in developing a collection is exciting, challenging, and in the end - very rewarding, seeing ideas develop from start to finish!</p>
<p>I was always making clothes in my spare time, while going to school and working, both full-time. If an order came my way, I filled them. Once I began to focus on BUTCH DIVA full-time, the feedback, the demand, and the overall movement began to spread right before my eyes!  I have soooo many amazing clients now and can’t wait to open a store accessible to everyone!</p>
<p>To date BUTCH DIVA has been seen on celebrities such as Nicki Minaj, Lil Kim, Amy Winehouse, Kelis, Mya, Queen Patra, Tokyo Diva, Kat Graham, Jonte, and many other emerging indie artitsts. BUTCH DIVA has also been a featured designer launched in the infamous NYC city boutique Patricia Field. The internet buzz on BUTCH DIVA has grown to millions over the years spreading over blogs, online magazines, tags, &amp; beyond! This past summer, BUTCH DIVA also collaborated with Addidas on their ""White Space Project"" campaign in NYC. BUTCH DIVA has been imitated heavily over the years, however has always manages to stay ahead with fresh and innovative styles incorporating spandex, leather, and textures.</p>

<h3>About the designer, Keishel Williams</h3>
<p>My name is Keishel Williams, a young designer originally from the beautiful Republic of Trinidad &amp; Tobago. With my cool Caribbean upbringing and savvy New York lifestyle, I’ve learnt that people need two major things in life- to feel at ease and beautiful, and to be able to afford it. At an early age I was exposed to art and I was inspired to start my own clothing line at the age of 12, showing my first pieces at my high school in Toco, Trinidad. Since then, my fashion journey has taken me on many highs and many lows as I share my passion and inspirations with the world. After interning at Essence magazine, doing a few fashion courses at FIT and Wobe Tobe-Coburn and assisting and designing in many shows, it hit me- women need to look and feel smart, classy and independent! That’s where my line, <em>jlehsiek</em>, was born.</p>
<p>Just like many others in this business, I continue to face an everyday battle of maintaining a continuous collection on a very small budget. The faith and support of others is what keeps the dream alive of offering affordable, luxurious and most of all timeless clothing to clients and fans. My aim is to make consumers feel great about their style today, tomorrow and years from now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About <em>jlehsiek </em>and the new collection “Reveal”</strong></p>
<p> <em>jlehsiek</em> is a rising brand which made its mark during New York Fashion Week in February 2011. The young and visionary Caribbean-American fashion designer, Keishel Williams, debuted her Fall 2011 collection, “Sunday in the Park” inspired by Georges-Pierre Seurat’s painting <a href=""http://www.artchive.com/artchive/S/seurat/jatte.jpg.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte- 1884</a>, at the Foley Art Gallery in Chelsea, NY. Members of the press, fashion bloggers and a host of fans came out to support the artistic designer and found that her collection surpassed all expectations.  According to press members from WB 11 and New York Daily News, the historical research and details in this designer’s work sets the brand apart from many designers, Caribbean or otherwise.</p>
<p><em>jlehsiek</em> is launching a new Fall/Winter collection in February 2013 titled “Reveal.” This collection depicts the revelation of strength and liberation through independence. “Reveal” will also nod to Carnival traditions brought to the Caribbean by the French aristocrats which were taken by the slaves turned into their own type of Carnival celebrations. This was their liberation.</p>
<p>The collection will embody strong luxury fabrics, prints, accented leather, and an edgy but whimsical surprise!</p>
<p>“Reveal” will make its debut during New York Fashion Week<sup>®</sup> (NYFW) February 7-14 2013 in front of buyers, store owners, press and fashion industry professionals. </p>

<p><strong>My words to you...</strong></p>
<p>A recent business associate shared this Maya Angelou quote with me while I'm preparing this collection:</p>
<p>“I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”</p>
<p>Regardless of the obstacles, I have felt the love for the line and I hope my clothing continue to make you feel great about YOURSELF. Thank you to everyone who has supported the line thus far, and who has been asking for more. It is my pleasure to give you a new collection.</p>
<p>With <em>jlehsiek</em>, it's about the experience...how my clothing makes people feel about themselves. ~KW</p>

That’s where my line, jlehsiek, was born.
Just like many others in this business, I continue to face an everyday battle of maintaining a continuous collection on a very small budget. The faith and support of others is what keeps the dream alive of offering affordable, luxurious and most of all timeless clothing to clients and fans. My aim is to make consumers feel great about their style today, tomorrow and years from now.
 
About jlehsiek and the new collection “Reveal”
 jlehsiek is a rising brand which made its mark during New York Fashion Week in February 2011. The young and visionary Caribbean-American fashion designer, Keishel Williams, debuted her Fall 2011 collection, “Sunday in the Park” inspired by Georges-Pierre Seurat’s painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte- 1884, at the Foley Art Gallery in Chelsea, NY. Members of the press, fashion bloggers and a host of fans came out to support the artistic designer and found that her collection surpassed all expectations.  According to press members from WB 11 and New York Daily News, the historical research and details in this designer’s work sets the brand apart from many designers, Caribbean or otherwise.
jlehsiek is launching a new Fall/Winter collection in February 2013 titled “Reveal.” This collection depicts the revelation of strength and liberation through independence. “Reveal” will also nod to Carnival traditions brought to the Caribbean by the French aristocrats which were taken by the slaves turned into their own type of Carnival celebrations. This was their liberation.
The collection will embody strong luxury fabrics, prints, accented leather, and an edgy but whimsical surprise!
“Reveal” will make its debut during New York Fashion Week® (NYFW) February 7-14 2013 in front of buyers, store owners, press and fashion industry professionals.

My words to you...
A recent business associate shared this Maya Angelou quote with me while I'm preparing this collection:
“I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”
Regardless of the obstacles, I have felt the love for the line and I hope my clothing continue to make you feel great about YOURSELF. Thank you to everyone who has supported the line thus far, and who has been asking for more. It is my pleasure to give you a new collection.
With jlehsiek, it's about the experience...how my clothing makes people feel about themselves. ~KW

it would be safer, allowing more risks in my design (funny , right?).
I had a feeling I would be more easily accepted. I came to
realize over the last couple of years that this actually pigeonholed
me.  In the last two years I've slowly started to distance
myself from the alternative umbrella.  Oddly, inspirations have
started to come more easily to me. My <a href=""http://www.blaspheminascloset.com/press/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">reviews have been fantastic</a>,
I've made great connections with other industry professionals and
have gotten to be a part of amazing events.</p>
<p>Over
the last couple of years I have learned a lot. Learned about my
family, my community, the fashion industry, and myself. Of course
things have been tight.  They tend to be when you run your own
business.  Over the last two years I was the main
breadwinner while my husband went back to college to get his
bachelors. But my productivity went up because I moved my operation
out of my home.  Recently I was even able to move to a store
front. My business has thrived as I evolve.  Now is the time to
make the big change.</p>

<p><b>Beauty.
 Strength.  Rebellion.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Like
a lot of women, as teenage girl I was stuck between being assertive
and having low self-esteem.  I knew what I wanted.  I knew I could achieve it.  But so many people tried to scare confidence out of me.  Many girls seem to have a point in
their developing years where they feel this way. It didn't help that
I was bullied.  For being the brown girl, the goth girl, the
weird art girl who read comics.  </p>
<p>My
mom, like most moms, used to say, ""Ignore them.  They're
just jealous.""  Like every teenager, I rolled my eyes and
said, ""Yeah, right.""  As an adult I found out in actuality that
many of them were.  I'm not saying this in a pompous way.  This wasn't really a sense of justice in my eyes
the way some victims of bullying feel.  It made me want even
more to instill a sense of strength in women and girls.  A lot
of girls are jealous of strength in other women because they can't
figure out the formula for that strength in themselves.  They
are scared of being seen as ""masculine"" or ""b*tchy"".  And the saddest part of the whole thing is we're conditioned to feel this way from a very young age.  Well, I want to teach women and girls that beauty, strength and pride
are all things they can simultaneously have and that we all deserve it.  Just not at the detriment of anyone else.  It's about personal strength, personal beauty and personal responsibility.</p>
<p>Designing
is my life blood.  When I'm creating I feel it deep within my heart
and pulsating through my fingertips. My creative process is deeply
personal. I forge a concept, I nurture it with research and my own
type of meditation and I tell the story through each piece of
clothing.  As far back as I can remember I have been an artist.  Over
the years my medium has become fashion. My goal with each piece is to
create your own wearable art that is imbued with love and dedication.

<p>I believe that quality and comfort are essential.  And I'm not talking about comfort like a fleece body suit or a pair of flannel pants.  I'm talking about comfort in your own skin.  When you put on a garment and think, ""Oh!  This is how I have always wanted to feel! This is how I want to feel all the time!""</p>
<p>Ladies.  You can be soft and commanding.  You can all be beautiful and strong.  Rebel against the
things that are making you doubt yourself.  Put on your
beautiful armor and face the day.  Your size, age, race or
station in life shouldn't matter if you find that glow inside and
wear it for the world to see.  Wear something that means
something to you.  Dress with intent. Don't buy something
because you need it “right now.”  You'll end up with a lot of
disposable things.  Invest in beautiful, well-made garments that will
last and can stand up season after season.</p>
<p>Now
I'm not saying what you wear will change your life, but it can give
you a little boost!

<p>""Samantha
Rei"" is about reveling in your femininity and finding the
strength to own your life while doing it.  You can be soft and
sweet while still having a warrior's spirit.  People seem to
think you have to be one or the other.  I believe if you want
to, you can be more.</p>
<p>""Samantha
Rei"" is about being an individual.  It's about feeling the
most YOU you have ever felt in your life.  It's about carving
out your corner of the world and owning it with quality garments,
made in small runs with love.  And lovers of my custom sized
items, don't be afraid, I will still be offering custom sized
garments!</p>

<p></p>This
isn't JUST for a fashion show or a new collection in the up front
(not on credit or loans) - it's a step closer to realizing a lifetime
dream. It may seem like a big chunk of change, but trust me in saying I've done years of research and the majority of fashion start-ups actually require two to four times this amount.  Luckily for me I have a lot of carry over from my years in the industry from machines to tools.  That really helps keep the cost down, so currently I'm asking for the bare minimum to take flight.  If I make above and beyond my goal, I'll be able to hire more help and crank things out even more efficiently!<p></p>
<p>I'm
excited about the perks I'm offering because not all of them are just things
- they are experiences.  I know the most memorable gifts I've
ever received are interactive experiences.  Custom clothing,
accessories, trips - they are all a bit of an adventure, aren't they?
 So many people feel so separated from the fashion community. It
seems like some kind of weird, unattainable group.  This is your
chance to get right in the thick of it!</p>
<p>Every cent of the funds from this campaign will go towards building my label
effectively and responsibly.  This includes web design for
the new online shop, fashion show expenses, collection costs, graphic design, filing
fees, machines to expand the workshop, advertising, hiring employees, small production runs (fabric,
notions, etc; production will stay domestic!), packaging, shipping, and MORE!  For a
more comprehensive list of expenses, feel free to contact me. Total transparency.</p>
<p>I
am a stickler for detail. Getting funded ensures I can contract
with people I trust who I know have my level of
quality control.</p>

<p>I
also have a long term goal of partnering with the human trafficking

know that what they learned helped them in some way.  That's in
my five year plan.</p>

the way some victims of bullying feel.  It made me want even
more to instill a sense of strength in women and girls.  A lot
of girls are jealous of strength in other women because they can't
figure out the formula for that strength in themselves.  They
are scared of being seen as ""masculine"" or ""b*tchy"".  And the saddest part of the whole thing is we're conditioned to feel this way from a very young age.  Well, I want to teach women and girls that beauty, strength and pride
are all things they can simultaneously have and that we all deserve it.  Just not at the detriment of anyone else.  It's about personal strength, personal beauty and personal responsibility.
Designing
is my life blood.  When I'm creating I feel it deep within my heart
and pulsating through my fingertips. My creative process is deeply
personal. I forge a concept, I nurture it with research and my own
type of meditation and I tell the story through each piece of
clothing.  As far back as I can remember I have been an artist.  Over
the years my medium has become fashion. My goal with each piece is to
create your own wearable art that is imbued with love and dedication.
 












""The first time I saw Samantha's designs, I was immediately enchanted. I knew I had to work with her, even if it was just to wear one of her designs to an event. Not only is her work beautiful, unique, and a joy to wear - but Samantha herself is an intelligent, kind woman whose style and vision continues to evolve and impress.""          - Scarlett Pomers: Actress/Musician


""Samantha
has an incredible eye for detail and design. Not only do her
creations make the wearer feel like they shine, but her warm
personality also makes it such a pleasure to work with her on
bringing your vision to life."" 
           - Shien Lee: Shien Lee Creative Group, LLC/ Dances of Vice


""Samantha is an amazing woman! She is positive, confident, and a loyal friend. Fashion is her game, and you can be sure that she brings it! Everything Sam designs turns out gorgeous. I love her aesthetic!""           - Jamie Walton: The Wayne Foundation


I have been working with Samanatha Rei for over 6 years. Her designs and creative solutions have never failed to bring enjoyment to my guests and convention attendees. We have always included her collections in the fashion shows that have become one of the largest in the Steampunk community and for good reason, they sell.

I am proud to call Samantha a friend and  a business associate who truly brings good ideas and a fresh approach to my business.


           - Eric Jon Larson: President of Vector Art House/TeslaCon


""Samantha Rei emanates a glow of brilliance, warmth and harmony which she sews into her creations. Her designs exude a certain magical charm that is synonymous with her beautiful smile. When you put on one of those designs, which I have had the pleasure of doing, you feel transported into a person that you read about in fairytales-dainty yet strong. Samantha Rei will equip you with a set of armor that shines a light of beauty and strength against those things that may hold a negative charge. Take that armor and wear it proud, I do!""
          - Carla
	Haglund: Fairshadow Photography


""Samantha Rei is a bright and intelligent designer.  She has an uncanny way of connecting with her clients to meet their ever changing needs.  Her knowledge and creativity allow her to create inspired one of a kind clothing that commands a second glance.  When wearing  ""Samantha Rei"" it shows from the inside out.  Clothing by Samantha Rei is a statement of confidence and empowerment.""          - Thom Navarro: Tim + Thom

I believe that quality and comfort are essential.  And I'm not talking about comfort like a fleece body suit or a pair of flannel pants.  I'm talking about comfort in your own skin.  When you put on a garment and think, ""Oh!  This is how I have always wanted to feel! This is how I want to feel all the time!""
Ladies.  You can be soft and commanding.  You can all be beautiful and strong.  Rebel against the
things that are making you doubt yourself.  Put on your
beautiful armor and face the day.  Your size, age, race or
station in life shouldn't matter if you find that glow inside and
wear it for the world to see.  Wear something that means
something to you.  Dress with intent. Don't buy something
because you need it “right now.”  You'll end up with a lot of
disposable things.  Invest in beautiful, well-made garments that will
last and can stand up season after season.
Now
I'm not saying what you wear will change your life, but it can give
you a little boost! 




Louis Bustos Dress Design Challange


""Samantha
Rei"" is about reveling in your femininity and finding the
strength to own your life while doing it.  You can be soft and
sweet while still having a warrior's spirit.  People seem to
think you have to be one or the other.  I believe if you want
to, you can be more.
""Samantha
Rei"" is about being an individual.  It's about feeling the
most YOU you have ever felt in your life.  It's about carving
out your corner of the world and owning it with quality garments,
made in small runs with love.  And lovers of my custom sized
items, don't be afraid, I will still be offering custom sized
garments!





To quote Vera Wang:
""I was always taught that anyone should be able to pursue their dream and that the biggest crime is not to try. That made me motivated, and I didn't want to wonder what could have happened.""




Fabric from my upcoming collection ""Cyclone Wasteland""



This
isn't JUST for a fashion show or a new collection in the up front
(not on credit or loans) - it's a step closer to realizing a lifetime
dream. It may seem like a big chunk of change, but trust me in saying I've done years of research and the majority of fashion start-ups actually require two to four times this amount.  Luckily for me I have a lot of carry over from my years in the industry from machines to tools.  That really helps keep the cost down, so currently I'm asking for the bare minimum to take flight.  If I make above and beyond my goal, I'll be able to hire more help and crank things out even more efficiently!
I'm
excited about the perks I'm offering because not all of them are just things
- they are experiences.  I know the most memorable gifts I've
ever received are interactive experiences.  Custom clothing,
accessories, trips - they are all a bit of an adventure, aren't they?
 So many people feel so separated from the fashion community. It
seems like some kind of weird, unattainable group.  This is your
chance to get right in the thick of it!
Every cent of the funds from this campaign will go towards building my label
effectively and responsibly.  This includes web design for
the new online shop, fashion show expenses, collection costs, graphic design, filing
fees, machines to expand the workshop, advertising, hiring employees, small production runs (fabric,
notions, etc; production will stay domestic!), packaging, shipping, and MORE!  For a
more comprehensive list of expenses, feel free to contact me. Total transparency.
I
am a stickler for detail. Getting funded ensures I can contract
with people I trust who I know have my level of
quality control.

I
also have a long term goal of partnering with the human trafficking
charities I support in the hopes of offering training to rescued
victims so they can go into the world with a skill that will help
them get a job. They don't have to work for me.  I just want to
know that what they learned helped them in some way.  That's in
my five year plan.
If
for some reason I don't reach my entire goal, the funds will go to
the most pressing things.  Filing my LLC, paying my accountant, graphic designer and contractors, materials for samples for my next two collections,
marketing and supplies (dressforms, iron, etc).



As we reach different milestones in the campaign, we will offer add-ons to existing contributors AND unlock more limited perks!
I want to show you how much I appreciate your support so keep sharing and checking back to see what we add!






I know not everyone can contribute financially.  An easy way to to help me make Samantha Rei a success is to share this campaign with all of your friends and followers on your social networking pages.  Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, even your blog.  Your confidence and support can help make this happen!
There are easy to use share tools right on this page.  Thank you so much for your contribution!
Thanks to Nic Abrego for the beautiful video, Carla, Matt and Rhea for the pretty pictures, Helen Bednar for the gorgeous new logo, my assistant Christian and everyone else who has helped me put together this campaign <3

And thank you out there!  I appreciate your support more than you know!

<br/><p></p><h2 style=""color: #000be7; text-align: center;"">’It’s more than just a box!’</h2>
<p></p><br/>Rapide One is the first true desktop 3D Printer to offer professional rapid prototyping with stunning design and functionality at an affordable price.<br/><br/><h3>What is Rapide One?</h3>

Rapide One is an affordable professional desktop 3D Printer.   What makes Rapide One unique is it has been built from the ground up with the goal of creating a fully functional desktop 3D printer, which fits the gap in the market between high-end 3D printers and the hobbyist 3D printers currently available.
<br/><br/>

Rapide One is fully enclosed; we enclosed Rapide One to ensure a constant temperature throughout the build and to make the printer office, school and home safe.   There are two large Plexiglas viewing panels, which allow easy viewing during the build.   The constant temperature reduces the cracking and shrinking issues open 3D Printers have and it increases the build success rate substantially.
<br/><br/>

Rapide One has a full cartridge system built into the top of the printer to reduce over all size and to make usage simple and easy with zero mess, which is common with external, mounted spools.   You can choose to use a cartridge or just load material into the top of the machine without a cartridge.   The cartridge system allows users to change color and material type for each print easily and quickly.
<br/><br/>

Unlike all the other current desktop 3D Printers Rapide One is designed to be plug and play.   Due to our unique enclosed housing and cartridge system you just set the print up, click start and walk away.   When the build is complete you simply return and remove.   This opens up endless possibilities for ‘bot queues’ and ‘print shops’ because the requirement to supervise each build is no longer required.
<br/><br/>

Rapide One is ideal for office, school or home use.   It is as quiet as it is efficient as it is safe.   There are no over powering fumes, no constant rattle and being enclosed no way for anyone to interrupt the build by placing objects or hands into the printer when in operation. <br/><br/>


Rapide One is the answer to the current dilemma facing those wanting to utilize the benefits of a 3D Printer without all the negatives of fumes, noise and safety.   Rapide One is ‘more than just a box’ it is a complete solution and the next generation in desktop 3D Printing.<br/><br/>


Rapide One will have a RRP of $2499 when it is released mid 2014.   We are offering our Indiegogo contributors the opportunity to get the first Rapide One’s produced for $1499 (a saving of $1000).   By being a part of our campaign you will not only be receiving Rapide One at a substantial saving but also providing valuable feedback for enhancements, future models and development of our brand. <br/><br/><p><br/></p><h3 style=""font-size: 24px;"">Rapide One has been featured in:<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://rapide-3d.com/rapide-indiegog/new-logo2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>

</p><h3>Why We Developed Rapide One</h3>

Our motivation;  there are no low-cost Desktop 3D printers that meet the quality standards of the professional designer or that offer a safe, quiet and an office friendly design. <br/><br/>

Our goal;  to provide a high quality Desktop 3D printer that is not only affordable but has the power and resolution of a professional 3D Printer without the high price tag right on your desktop.  <br/><br/>

Our design;  we looked at all current Desktop 3D printers on the market and realized that they just don’t offer the ability to make the beautiful designs a reality or meet the high demands required for rapid prototyping.<br/><br/>

With Rapide One, we think we have created a Desktop 3D Printer that is easy-to-use whilst still rivaling the output of high-end printers at a fraction of the cost.   <br/><br/>

Rapide One is every thing a high quality affordable Professional Desktop 3D printer should be and it’s not UGLY!.

  <p></p><br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://rapide-3d.com/rapide-indiegog/Indiegogo%20Campaign%201.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h3>Rapide One is about to change the way people see 3D Printers.</h3>

In our research we found that there was a big gap in the market between the low-end 3D printers and professional-quality 3D printers.  An entry level professional 3D printer is ridiculously expensive, is complex to use and requires you buy an expensive software package to operate it which then involves upwards of 1 year to master.<br/><br/> 

As a result of this research we decided to design a 3D printer that not only fills this gap but one that is the solution to the problem.  We believe Rapide One ticks all the right boxes and we are now ready to move this vision into full production.
<br/><br/><p></p>
<h3>Quality Desktop 3D Printer Comparison Chart</h3>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://rapide-3d.com/rapide-indiegog/comparison-chart.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h3>High Resolution Printing Belongs on Your Desktop.</h3>
<p>Over the past 18 months we have worked tirelessly to design and develop Rapide One.   With your help, we are ready to take the final step and put Rapide One into full production.  By supporting our campaign, you will not only be one of the first to get one of our amazing 3D printer’s but you will also assist us to usher in a new era of 3D printing - an era in which your creative output is no longer limited by price or dauntingly complex machines. <br/><br/></p>
<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://rapide-3d.com/rapide-indiegog/Indiegogo%20Campaign%204.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h3>Design</h3>
<p>Rapide One’s design is Innovative, Dynamic and Fresh. A fusion of technology and design built to seamlessly integrate with your surroundings.<br/><br/>

We have gone to extraordinary lengths to design the complete 3D printing experience for you from the ground up. Rapide One has been engineered to produce quality high-resolution parts with ease.  From its unique fully enclosed housing to a simple to use cartridge system for material Rapide One ticks all the boxes of the most discerning designer and maker. <br/><br/>

We didn’t invent the 3D Printer but we believe we have moved the benchmark for what a 3D Printer should be and in the process made professional quality 3D printing a reality for many.<br/><br/></p>
<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://rapide-3d.com/rapide-indiegog/Indiegogo%20Campaign%203.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Our extensive research, design, and experimentation, has allowed us to work out how to create a Professional 3D printer at a much lower cost, making this dynamic technology available to everyone.<br/><br/>

The results are simply amazing. Rapide One can print layers as thin as 100 microns with features as small as 200 microns in a build volume of 170 x 170 x 170mm.  This means you can print complex geometries with the exquisite details and beautiful surface finish that will make your prototypes and creations stand out with little or no finishing required. <br/><br/>   
Rapide One gives you the ability to precisely generate prototypes and rapidly print them.  This means your creations will be in your hands much faster and at a fraction of the current costs.
</p>
<br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://rapide-3d.com/rapide-indiegog/Indiegogo%20Campaign%2027.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><h3>Software</h3>
<p>Great hardware is only the start.  We understand how important being able to use Rapide One with any platform will be.  Rapide One is compatible with all open source software applications including Repiter and Replicator G. <br/><br/>

A key advantage of the open source software is it is constantly being upgraded and enhanced, its free and easy to use.  This means with Rapide One you are not locked into using our software, you do not have ongoing costs in terms of maintenance for that software and you are free to choose the software you are most comfortable using.<br/><br/>

But, we didn’t stop there, we created Rapide One to work just as perfectly with both PC &amp; Mac so everyone has the opportunity to create not just a select few.
</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>When Rapide One is released, it will come with filament (material) developed in our own factory especially for Rapide One.<br/><br/>You will also be able to purchase additional material from our full range of ABS, PLA and PVA in a wide range of colors.  However, unlike many manufacturers of 3D Printers we do not require you use Rapide One exclusively with our filament, you are free to use what ever filament you want in Rapide One but it will perform at its best with our filament.
</p>
<br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://rapide-3d.com/rapide-indiegog/Indiegogo%20Campaign%2017.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><h3>Why We Need You</h3>
<p>Without your help we would need to sell Rapide One through our existing supply channels. This means:<br/></p><ul>
<li>Rapide One will be sold at considerably higher price,</li>
<li>Rapide One will enter the market much later,</li>
<li>Rapide One will have less features, and</li>
<li>Rapide One will have no customization possibilities.</li>
</ul>
Backing us now, you will be ensuring the development team can complete our goal, and help us realize the full potential of this amazing technology and at the same time getting your very own 3D Printer at a substantial saving on the RRP cost in the future.
<p></p>
<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
<p>
As a backer of our project you will be one of the first to get a new Rapide One on your desktop and by being a part of our project in its infancy you will receive your very own Rapide One with the knowledge that you were a part of something big that created something that will take the 3D Printer market forward again.</p>
<br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://rapide-3d.com/rapide-indiegog/Indiegogo%20Campaign%2028.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><h3>What Rewards Will I Get?</h3>
<p>As a token of our appreciation of your support you will receive your very own Rapide One from our first full production run’s (based on when you make your contribution to our campaign) and the satisfaction of knowing you were there when we needed you most.</p>
<h3>Where Are We Now?</h3>
<p>We have completed the development phase, have negotiated a new factory and are ready to launch full production.  The chassis, components and industrial design are already complete, we are now testing the software with prototypes in our office and at the factory.   We just need to compete the tooling and molds for the housing and we are set for full production.
</p>
<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://rapide-3d.com/rapide-indiegog/Timeline02.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h3>Where Will Your Funding Go?</h3>
<p>We have invested a substantial amount in the development phase of this project.  Your funding is the critical link to the completion of our project and will be used to realize our dream of the world's first 3D Printer that has been designed with you in mind and one that is not just a concept but a reality.</p>
<h3>Use of Funds</h3>
<p>We have working prototypes and our new factory is being readied to go into full production once we have the funds to complete the tooling and molds. <br/><br/>
Our new production facility has over 3200m2 dedicated floor space which will give us the capability to produce Rapide One at a rate of 500 – 1000 per month which is a substantial leap in production capability compared to the majority of 3D Printers on the market.  We need your help to take the next step.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Funding Milestones: </h3>
<p>The first $20,000 raised through the campaign will be used to purchase the additional tooling with the final $80,000 used to make the molds we require for the housing and some internal sections.  This phase of production requires we produce a minimum of 1000 housings and this is a substantial investment.
</p>
<h3>Your Contribution</h3>
<p>We have put a lot of time, funding and effort into our project but like many things in life not everything can be completed by just a few. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/><h3>Our Exciting Range of Perks:<br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://rapide-3d.com/rapide-indiegog/Perks-List.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</h3>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>Like many Indiegogo projects, we have faced several key risks and challenges in getting Rapide One as far as we have. The primary risks for us included:</p>
<h3>Engineering</h3>
<p>To achieve the level of simplicity in user experience that we have, we had to design and engineer a very complex machine. We have taken two key steps to ensure our engineering success.<br/><br/>

We have brought together a team of engineers and designers who are amazingly talented.<br/><br/>

We have tested Rapide One with an obsession for perfection.<br/><br/>

In the last year, we have built 3 generations of prototypes, a production run of alpha machines and now have a run of beta machines that are getting put through their paces in our factory.<br/><br/>

This is giving us an amazing amount of data for ongoing research and development.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Supply Chain and Logistics</h3>
<p>Many Indiegogo campaigns encounter problems when taking their prototypes to production. This includes issues finding suppliers and engineering products for mass-production. Smooth execution is absolutely essential to overcoming such risks. <br/><br/>

We have eliminated 95% of these issues by having our own factory where we will produce the printer. Our internal construction is CNC Aircraft Grade Aluminum which means we can rapidly produce Rapide One in quantities ranging from 1 to 1000 simply and most importantly cost effectively because we own the factory.  As a result we will be able to meet all our promises on time and on budget. <br/><br/>

Every thing is now in place, we only require the resources to commence production.<br/><br/></p>

<p>We've engineered our material (filaments) to work with the Rapide One. It's a huge part of the technical work that has gone into this project to ensure your prints have a much higher success rate than with other printers. <br/><br/>

The filament properties are closely linked with the Rapide One design. However, you are welcome to use any filament you choose with Rapide One bearing in mind we will not be able to offer support for third party filaments due to variations in properties which we are sure you can understand.<br/><br/></p>
<h3 class=""faq"" style=""cursor: pointer;"">How Does The Material Tray and Cartridge System Work? </h3>
<p>With the Rapide One, you simply load up to 500gms of material / filament into the holding tray or what is necessary for your prints. The top cover conceals the filament inside the machine. <br/><br/>

Our cartridge system allows for the easy removal and change over of filament. This is very convenient if you intend to print in different material types and or colors on a regular basis.   You simply lift the top of Rapide One and place the cartridge in.  Our cartridges come with 250gms of filament / material and are stackable so you can easily store and access the materials you require.<br/><br/></p>
<h3 class=""faq"" style=""cursor: pointer;"">Can You Design With The Software? What Operating Systems Will Support The Software?</h3>
<p>Rapide 3D firmware has been designed to work with all open source 3D printing software.  We will provide the links to this software with each machine.

Rapide One is the first true desktop 3D Printer to offer professional rapid prototyping with stunning design and functionality at an affordable price.What is Rapide One?

Rapide One is an affordable professional desktop 3D Printer.   What makes Rapide One unique is it has been built from the ground up with the goal of creating a fully functional desktop 3D printer, which fits the gap in the market between high-end 3D printers and the hobbyist 3D printers currently available.


Rapide One is fully enclosed; we enclosed Rapide One to ensure a constant temperature throughout the build and to make the printer office, school and home safe.   There are two large Plexiglas viewing panels, which allow easy viewing during the build.   The constant temperature reduces the cracking and shrinking issues open 3D Printers have and it increases the build success rate substantially.


Rapide One has a full cartridge system built into the top of the printer to reduce over all size and to make usage simple and easy with zero mess, which is common with external, mounted spools.   You can choose to use a cartridge or just load material into the top of the machine without a cartridge.   The cartridge system allows users to change color and material type for each print easily and quickly.


Unlike all the other current desktop 3D Printers Rapide One is designed to be plug and play.   Due to our unique enclosed housing and cartridge system you just set the print up, click start and walk away.   When the build is complete you simply return and remove.   This opens up endless possibilities for ‘bot queues’ and ‘print shops’ because the requirement to supervise each build is no longer required.


Rapide One is ideal for office, school or home use.   It is as quiet as it is efficient as it is safe.   There are no over powering fumes, no constant rattle and being enclosed no way for anyone to interrupt the build by placing objects or hands into the printer when in operation. 


Rapide One is the answer to the current dilemma facing those wanting to utilize the benefits of a 3D Printer without all the negatives of fumes, noise and safety.   Rapide One is ‘more than just a box’ it is a complete solution and the next generation in desktop 3D Printing.


Rapide One will have a RRP of $2499 when it is released mid 2014.   We are offering our Indiegogo contributors the opportunity to get the first Rapide One’s produced for $1499 (a saving of $1000).   By being a part of our campaign you will not only be receiving Rapide One at a substantial saving but also providing valuable feedback for enhancements, future models and development of our brand. Rapide One has been featured in:



Why We Developed Rapide One

Our motivation;  there are no low-cost Desktop 3D printers that meet the quality standards of the professional designer or that offer a safe, quiet and an office friendly design. 

Our goal;  to provide a high quality Desktop 3D printer that is not only affordable but has the power and resolution of a professional 3D Printer without the high price tag right on your desktop.  

Our design;  we looked at all current Desktop 3D printers on the market and realized that they just don’t offer the ability to make the beautiful designs a reality or meet the high demands required for rapid prototyping.

With Rapide One, we think we have created a Desktop 3D Printer that is easy-to-use whilst still rivaling the output of high-end printers at a fraction of the cost.   

Rapide One is every thing a high quality affordable Professional Desktop 3D printer should be and it’s not UGLY!.

  Rapide One is about to change the way people see 3D Printers.

In our research we found that there was a big gap in the market between the low-end 3D printers and professional-quality 3D printers.  An entry level professional 3D printer is ridiculously expensive, is complex to use and requires you buy an expensive software package to operate it which then involves upwards of 1 year to master. 

As a result of this research we decided to design a 3D printer that not only fills this gap but one that is the solution to the problem.  We believe Rapide One ticks all the right boxes and we are now ready to move this vision into full production.

Quality Desktop 3D Printer Comparison Chart
High Resolution Printing Belongs on Your Desktop.
Over the past 18 months we have worked tirelessly to design and develop Rapide One.   With your help, we are ready to take the final step and put Rapide One into full production.  By supporting our campaign, you will not only be one of the first to get one of our amazing 3D printer’s but you will also assist us to usher in a new era of 3D printing - an era in which your creative output is no longer limited by price or dauntingly complex machines. 
Design
Rapide One’s design is Innovative, Dynamic and Fresh. A fusion of technology and design built to seamlessly integrate with your surroundings.

We have gone to extraordinary lengths to design the complete 3D printing experience for you from the ground up. Rapide One has been engineered to produce quality high-resolution parts with ease.  From its unique fully enclosed housing to a simple to use cartridge system for material Rapide One ticks all the boxes of the most discerning designer and maker. 

We didn’t invent the 3D Printer but we believe we have moved the benchmark for what a 3D Printer should be and in the process made professional quality 3D printing a reality for many.
Hardware
Our extensive research, design, and experimentation, has allowed us to work out how to create a Professional 3D printer at a much lower cost, making this dynamic technology available to everyone.

The results are simply amazing. Rapide One can print layers as thin as 100 microns with features as small as 200 microns in a build volume of 170 x 170 x 170mm.  This means you can print complex geometries with the exquisite details and beautiful surface finish that will make your prototypes and creations stand out with little or no finishing required.    
Rapide One gives you the ability to precisely generate prototypes and rapidly print them.  This means your creations will be in your hands much faster and at a fraction of the current costs.

Software
Great hardware is only the start.  We understand how important being able to use Rapide One with any platform will be.  Rapide One is compatible with all open source software applications including Repiter and Replicator G. 

A key advantage of the open source software is it is constantly being upgraded and enhanced, its free and easy to use.  This means with Rapide One you are not locked into using our software, you do not have ongoing costs in terms of maintenance for that software and you are free to choose the software you are most comfortable using.

But, we didn’t stop there, we created Rapide One to work just as perfectly with both PC & Mac so everyone has the opportunity to create not just a select few.

Materials
When Rapide One is released, it will come with filament (material) developed in our own factory especially for Rapide One.You will also be able to purchase additional material from our full range of ABS, PLA and PVA in a wide range of colors.  However, unlike many manufacturers of 3D Printers we do not require you use Rapide One exclusively with our filament, you are free to use what ever filament you want in Rapide One but it will perform at its best with our filament.

Why We Need You
Without your help we would need to sell Rapide One through our existing supply channels. This means:
Rapide One will be sold at considerably higher price,
Rapide One will enter the market much later,
Rapide One will have less features, and
Rapide One will have no customization possibilities.

Backing us now, you will be ensuring the development team can complete our goal, and help us realize the full potential of this amazing technology and at the same time getting your very own 3D Printer at a substantial saving on the RRP cost in the future.

What's in it for you?

As a backer of our project you will be one of the first to get a new Rapide One on your desktop and by being a part of our project in its infancy you will receive your very own Rapide One with the knowledge that you were a part of something big that created something that will take the 3D Printer market forward again.
What Rewards Will I Get?
As a token of our appreciation of your support you will receive your very own Rapide One from our first full production run’s (based on when you make your contribution to our campaign) and the satisfaction of knowing you were there when we needed you most.
Where Are We Now?
We have completed the development phase, have negotiated a new factory and are ready to launch full production.  The chassis, components and industrial design are already complete, we are now testing the software with prototypes in our office and at the factory.   We just need to compete the tooling and molds for the housing and we are set for full production.

Where Will Your Funding Go?
We have invested a substantial amount in the development phase of this project.  Your funding is the critical link to the completion of our project and will be used to realize our dream of the world's first 3D Printer that has been designed with you in mind and one that is not just a concept but a reality.
Use of Funds
We have working prototypes and our new factory is being readied to go into full production once we have the funds to complete the tooling and molds. 
Our new production facility has over 3200m2 dedicated floor space which will give us the capability to produce Rapide One at a rate of 500 – 1000 per month which is a substantial leap in production capability compared to the majority of 3D Printers on the market.  We need your help to take the next step.
Funding Milestones: 
The first $20,000 raised through the campaign will be used to purchase the additional tooling with the final $80,000 used to make the molds we require for the housing and some internal sections.  This phase of production requires we produce a minimum of 1000 housings and this is a substantial investment.

Your Contribution
We have put a lot of time, funding and effort into our project but like many things in life not everything can be completed by just a few. 

You and your contribution will enable us to reach our goal. You will be a part of a world first in enabling us to complete production of arguably the most beautiful 3D Printer in the market which has been designed and built to enhance your home, work space or workshop.

Why Trust Rapide 3D
Rapide 3D has more than a decade of experience in the design and development of advanced technology. We have worked with technological integration and development with our partners in China and around the world and are now at the cutting edge of 3D Printing technology and design. 

We have completed 30+ projects for our international partners on time and on budget. We now want to take it one step further by developing our own 3D Printer range. 

Moving our business exclusively to 3D Printer technology and its production means we will be able to offer a 3D Printer range that is functional, flexible and beautiful at an affordable price. 

Today, it is rare to be able to design a product, which can totally change how we see or use a technology, but Rapide One does just that by changing how you perceive what 3D Printing is and will be in the future.
We Are Ready For Full Production With Your Support.

 We have engineered Rapide One to be mass-produced efficiently using a full CNC chassis, which simplifies the currently complex issue of manufacture that other 3D printer manufacturers encounter.

We have produced 3 generations of prototypes, tested a wide range of materials (ABS, PLA, PVA) using different formulations to find the best match for Rapide One and started producing our own filament.

We have now commenced the set up for full-scale manufacturing to get your Rapide One delivered to you as soon as possible. This is the most critical component of realizing our dream and we will need a lot of support to do the job right. That’s why we’ve turned to Indiegogo to get the production lines up and running!

If you decide to become one of our foundation contributors, you will get a large discount and be one of the first to have our product on your desktop. But more importantly, you’ll play a huge part in starting this revolution in 3D printing and rapid prototyping by providing your feedback to help us with upgrades and enhancements so we can all do amazing things with Rapide One. 


Our Exciting Range of Perks:

Risks and Challenges
Like many Indiegogo projects, we have faced several key risks and challenges in getting Rapide One as far as we have. The primary risks for us included:
Engineering
To achieve the level of simplicity in user experience that we have, we had to design and engineer a very complex machine. We have taken two key steps to ensure our engineering success.

We have brought together a team of engineers and designers who are amazingly talented.

We have tested Rapide One with an obsession for perfection.

In the last year, we have built 3 generations of prototypes, a production run of alpha machines and now have a run of beta machines that are getting put through their paces in our factory.

This is giving us an amazing amount of data for ongoing research and development.
Supply Chain and Logistics
Many Indiegogo campaigns encounter problems when taking their prototypes to production. This includes issues finding suppliers and engineering products for mass-production. Smooth execution is absolutely essential to overcoming such risks. 

We have eliminated 95% of these issues by having our own factory where we will produce the printer. Our internal construction is CNC Aircraft Grade Aluminum which means we can rapidly produce Rapide One in quantities ranging from 1 to 1000 simply and most importantly cost effectively because we own the factory.  As a result we will be able to meet all our promises on time and on budget. 

Every thing is now in place, we only require the resources to commence production.
The Rapide 3D Team
Finding the right people is a challenge for any endeavor. Successfully developing a 3D printer to the standards we have requires a team of talented, passionate, and motivated designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. 

We have formed an awesome team, but we will have to bring in more talent in to realize our dream. We are actively looking for new team members to join Rapide 3D so we can hit the ground running!

Jewels use for
the Project like



“Coral”
It penetrates the red light from the mars planet into a human body.  It helps in business, service and fulfills
every wish. It is highly beneficial for one who is coward or easily defeated by
their enemies. It strengthens the wearer's self-confidence. If a weak person
eats the power of coral with honey, it makes him strong. If a person, suffering
from cough and cold and takes coral powder with betel leaf, it relieves him/her
from the painful disease. The Coral paste with cream is good for heart patients.
“Pearl”
is a combination of calcium and oxygen. It brings certainty and peace in the
lives of the people with uncertainty and problems. The pearl pacifies one's
evil desires. It improves knowledge and brings prosperity. It also brings a
glow on one's face and removes dullness. The Pearl is highly recommended for people
with uneven temper. If it is taken in the form of paste or powder, it removes
the problems like heart diseases, mental disorders, blood pressure, urine
infections, stones, piles, dental diseases and stomach ailments.“Emerald”
It removes the disturbances of mind and brings peace to mind. If a student uses
this he/she becomes sharp. It also increases the eyesight, makes a man more
prosperous and keeps away the problems of evil spirits. It destroys bad dreams
and makes healthy and wealthy.  If
someone conspirates against the person wearing ""Emerald”, the conspiracy
is readily surfaced and everyone becomes aware of it. It is considered to be a
good omen if any lover gifts emerald to his beloved. It generates the feelings
of sympathy, love and kindness in a human being.  The Mercury planet is associated with
""VOICE"". Weak Mercury planet causes the problems like asthma, cough,
stammering etc Thus, in every situation, wearing emerald is very advantageous“Ruby”  It brings happiness, prosperity and
reputation to a person. A person gets relief from fear, pain and sufferings. It
is helpful in increasing generation as well as good for ambitious person and
many heart and eye problems occur due the weakness of this planet. It is good
to wear ruby to cure these ailments. If it is taken in the form of powder and paste
it cures the diseases of piles, blood diseases, gas trouble, dry cough, hiccups
and body pain.“Yellow Sapphire”
brings strength, knowledge, healthy life, reputation and mental peace. If there
is any delay in the marriage of a girl, then it solves it. It is good for
family life and removes the misunderstanding between the husband and wife. It
is extremely good for writers, advocates, scholars and business men. It helps
in pacifying anger. It strengthens the friendship too. If it is taken it in the
form of powder or paste it is useful for fever, asthma, cough, bad smell in
breath, kidney and gastric trouble etc“Zircon”
It is also good for persons who, are suffering from mental tensions, having
hurdles in their work and are struggling with their lives. The Politicians,
Gamblers, Lawyers and Smugglers should definitely use it. It is believed that
Zircon wearer can easily overcome any opposition.“Diamond” is one of the costly rare
and expensive stone in the world.  As we
know that Venus planet is responsible for the love, romance, harmony, arts and
beauty in the life of people. In the same way diamond also gives these entire
things to the human being so it is used widely. It is really advantageous for
the actors, painters, diplomats, artist hoteliers, doctors, and gold sellers,
seller of sugar and rice, musician and so on. It gives happy conjugal life and
cordial relationship with others members. This increases the stamina and
removes all health problems. It is very beneficial for impotency, hydrocil and
epilepsy and also saves from witches, black magic, witches and ghost as well as
removes all negative effects and gives the positive strength.  We are to make it clear that the project under
our reference is limited to its substitute; however we assure its effect is as
good as original jewel being the best among all of same character in the market “Cat’s Eye”
brings strength, happiness, wealth and son. It saves one from the enemy and
brings victory over the enemy. Its wearer remains safe from accidents, enemies,
punishment, diseases and poverty. It brings prosperity“Blue Sapphire ”It
is good for persons involved in the works like transportation, property,
contracts, workshop, factories, industries, small scale business, labor,
government services etc. As per Buddhism, it keeps away the bad thoughts and
makes the heart and the behavior of a man peaceful. It warns a person against
the bad plans of his enemy.

Every pair of sunglasses we’ve ever purchased - whether from large, well-known brands or small sunglasses startups - share one thing in common: the designs and colors were dictated to us by the brand. We think that’s ridiculous, and that’s why we’re doing it differently.
At Canvas we’re creating a world where consumers make design choices for themselves, and at a price that is affordable for everyone who wants a high quality pair of customized sunglasses. Additionally, all of our products and packaging are made from eco-friendly materials. Custom sunglasses that are both affordable and easy on the environment - what could be better than that!


If you are looking for the perfect pair of sunglasses, you can keep looking in the sea of overpriced, mass
produced, unoriginal frames where designs and colors are dictated to you by the
brands you buy from - or you can start designing your own.






We’re going to be launching with our first frame style, our take on the classic wayfarer. 
Through an easy to use online configuration tool, you will be able to:

Browse our extensive library of customizable patterns and designs that you won't find anywhere else
Customize each of the colors used in your design, creating a pair of sunglasses that is unique to your individual style
Upload images or designs of your own for the ultimate level of customization




Each pair is also individually produced and shipped within two business days!






Materials: Eco-friendly, proprietary new formula of recycled polycarbonate polymers that provide an extremely durable, lightweight, and comfortable fit!

Hinges: Uniquely designed “Snap and Click” locking hinges, mechanically engineered without the use of screws and springs.
Lenses: Premium optical grade CR-39 lenses with UV400 protection in your choice of five colors.
Design Application: The design and colors you select for your custom sunglasses actually becomes part of the frame itself, permanently imaged in high definition color!







Our fundraising goal is $10,000. Your donations will support the last and most important stage of our project, the final development of our online configurator. Additional funds raised beyond our goal will go towards the development of additional frame styles for you to customize.
In return for your early support of Canvas, we want you to be the first to design your own pair of custom sunglasses, and at exclusive Indiegogo pricing!

Hello everybody! My name is Denis and I live in Kazan (Russia). 

Here's my project - Sweaterrarium - custom knit sweaters. We've been knitting custom sweaters for two years already. Our aim is to make custom knit sweaters on demand with any patterns or pictures. 



What You Get
You get a unique made-to-order knitted sweater or hoodie with your own design and exactly your size. 

[sweaterrarium@gmail.com] 
All the sweaters are knitted by Sweaterrarium.Please be aware about the copyrights, we don't steal. If you doubt, redraw the picture, make it funny, change it somehow (we can help you do that), make it fan-art or derivative work under four factors of fair use. If we fit those rules, we fit any laws.


What we need knit

Sweaters






 If the picture is very complex we'll figure something out, i.e. add some embroidery. 





 Hoodies [if ti has a hood or a zipper, it's a hoodie]











Scarves




*Picture requirementsPlease be aware that we do not print a picture, we knit it. Colors on the picture are corresponding threads. A pixel is actually a knitted stitch. Number of pixels in a square centimeters can vary according to knitting class (small/big stitches). We consider approximately 5*5 stitches in a square centimeter for 10 class machine knitting. Jacquard knitting (most of present sweaters) has a strict physical limitation - 4 colors in a horizontal row. Intarsia knitting is more flexible. In fact all the limitations depend on a machine model.

MIX’s 96° FoV is nearly the widest field of view on the AR market.   Every AR device has an effective FoV, only within which virtual objects can be displayed. For an AR device with a poor FoV, the view is so limited that only a partial, rather than complete, image can be viewed. It feels like looking out through a distant narrow window. As a result, the existence of this obvious ""window frame"" keeps reminding us of the unreal nature of the image. But for an AR device with a FoV close to the user’s eye, like MIX, the boundary to the virtual world can hardly be noticed—the seamless fusion of virtual objects and the real world defines an immersive AR experience.  MIX is small, lightweight (130g), and comfortable to wear.    Thanks to the Dual-Channel Mixed Optics we invented, MIX has a larger FoV and comes in a slimmer size than other products using an optical waveguide or surface reflectors.    Dual-channel mixed optical system has a compound structure with multiple layers. The key component is a set of dual-channel lenses with two different optical channels for enlarging the display light and bypassing the real light, to present AR vision with a large FoV.  *To know more about the optics of MIX, check #1 in FAQ. 
Content is the key factor for any AR glasses, so MIX connects to PC and is designed to be compatible with SteamVR. The existing games on SteamVR with a dark background can be used on MIX—you will see the real environment instead of the dark area. It’s a fresh AR experience with existing content.    Link: list of SteamVR apps suitable for MIX that we found. 
  
To deliver a complete AR experience, MIX supports positional tracking. In this way, a virtual object can remain in place in the real environment, rather than moving with you.    To have diverse interactions in AR, we provide optional add-ons, including eye tracking, hand tracking, and controllers.  
MIX comes with a removable black VR visor and a transparent AR visor for no extra charge. When the VR visor is attached, it will block all outside light, effectively allowing you to switch MIX from an AR glasses set to a VR set. You can then play any VR game that’s on SteamVR. When you want to experience AR again, just take it off and use the transparent visor.For those who want to explore the possibilities of AR content, by using a common SteamVR SDK, creating an AR application has never been easier. If you have experience developing content on SteamVR, just clear the background and apply the black skybox. Then your first AR application is born.   To know more about SteamVR SDK Aside from entertainment applications, MIX can also be used as the basis for the development of programs in many other fields, such as education, exhibition, design, and industry.    You can also hack with MIX in different ways:

Here are the three of us behind this Indiegogo project.  Risks and challengesWith six years of experience working with these workshops and artisans, and two successful Indiegogo campaigns behind us, we have seen it all.Workshops are carefully chosen based on experience, prior relationships, and reliability. Based on this we are confident that our team, suppliers, and vendors are able to keep the schedule, and deliver on time. With manufacturing, the most common challenge is production delays. Although we are well versed in production management and delivering goods on time, there are times in life when we are faced with difficulties out of our control. In the event of a short delay we will keep you updated, so you will know where your shoes are in the process, and what is going on.",87.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><br/>Getting to know Nelson Green, designer &amp; owner of NEL APPAREL LLC Men’s swimwear. <br/><br/>Hello, my name is Nelson Green and my goal is to successfully launch my Men’s swimwear line as a Black owned mainstream swimwear designer and join the ranks of  other mainstream men’s swimwear brands. For years the swimwear market has lacked optionality and variety when it comes to styles for men. NEL APPAREL aims high to bring more variety and options by offering a new form and style of eye catching, innovative, functional, fashionable, sustainable and comfortable designs for men with many preferred tastes. What makes NEL APPAREL unique other than the innovative design is the sustainability in our fabric . We monitor every step of the production process in order to reduce the use of water, energy, chemicals and waste. Our material is  imported from Italy and features supreme technology such as air wicking, quick dry and sunblock qualities. The material is super breathable for comfort with 4 way stretch, no pilling, safe in chlorine and salt water so colors don’t fade and stay vibrant, not to mention wrinkle free and super easy care. <br/><br/> Fashion played a big roll from childhood and is apart of who I am today. I always enjoyed styling myself and others so I have a keen eye for design and detail. At NEL APPAREL I sketch out my designs, purchase the fabric and materials and work with a team of New York professionals to bring my original ideas to life! I also model my own designs currently as it cuts down on costs to hire a variety of models at the moment until I make the money to pay a wide range of models, otherwise I use close friends who are very supportive. In all of this, I’m saying that it takes a lot of background work and expenses that I handle myself along with a support system and team to help me bring my visions and designs to life! This all costs and I cannot do it all alone which means I  need your help and support to get this Black Owned independent business up and moving to reach its fullest potential! I am doing this funding campaign to help raise funds for supreme quality material for every man’s comfort, manufacturing process  and distribution costs. Your contributions will help with many of these expenses and the magnitude of your contributions are greatly appreciated in helping me achieve these goals. </p>
<p>25k is what I will need to help fund NEL APPAREL Men’s swimwear line. This includes funds for large supply in quality fabric and bill of materials, making of cuts, patterns and sewing of samples for each individual designs by New York seamstress,manufacturing expenses in regards to costs per garment,  production costs and distributions. Your support and funding for NEL APPAREL will not go unnoticed. There will of course be a variety of rewards for your contributions. If the entire funding goal isn’t reached, then the money funded will be invested strategically into The NEL APPAREL business and brand to contribute to needed funds for the business. </p>
<p>Nothing in life that is valuable comes easy. Starting a successful business and brand takes a lot of work, patience, research, learning, trial and error and personal  financial risks. I certainly cannot do this alone without the support of friends, family, and anonymous donors  who believe in the success of a Black owned mainstream men’s swimwear line with quality products. </p>
<p>I understand that not everyone is able to contribute or donate financially; however any donation amount helps and is greatly appreciated! Please help get the word out! Share with friends, family, colleagues, neighbors and other people you may know! Please remember to use the Indiegogo share tools! <br/> </p>

At NEL APPAREL I sketch out my designs, purchase the fabric and materials and work with a team of New York professionals to bring my original ideas to life! I also model my own designs currently as it cuts down on costs to hire a variety of models at the moment until I make the money to pay a wide range of models, otherwise I use close friends who are very supportive. In all of this, I’m saying that it takes a lot of background work and expenses that I handle myself along with a support system and team to help me bring my visions and designs to life! This all costs and I cannot do it all alone which means I  need your help and support to get this Black Owned independent business up and moving to reach its fullest potential! I am doing this funding campaign to help raise funds for supreme quality material for every man’s comfort, manufacturing process  and distribution costs. Your contributions will help with many of these expenses and the magnitude of your contributions are greatly appreciated in helping me achieve these goals. 
25k is what I will need to help fund NEL APPAREL Men’s swimwear line. This includes funds for large supply in quality fabric and bill of materials, making of cuts, patterns and sewing of samples for each individual designs by New York seamstress,manufacturing expenses in regards to costs per garment,  production costs and distributions. Your support and funding for NEL APPAREL will not go unnoticed. There will of course be a variety of rewards for your contributions. If the entire funding goal isn’t reached, then the money funded will be invested strategically into The NEL APPAREL business and brand to contribute to needed funds for the business. 
Nothing in life that is valuable comes easy. Starting a successful business and brand takes a lot of work, patience, research, learning, trial and error and personal  financial risks. I certainly cannot do this alone without the support of friends, family, and anonymous donors  who believe in the success of a Black owned mainstream men’s swimwear line with quality products. 
I understand that not everyone is able to contribute or donate financially; however any donation amount helps and is greatly appreciated! Please help get the word out! Share with friends, family, colleagues, neighbors and other people you may know! Please remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p>During my duration of study, a lot of my friends had been troubled with 
ther phisical appearance and overweight.
I remember that my aunt had been struggling with her overweight and 
appearance for years.
<br/><br/>I saw how my aunt was suffering everyday, she had tried so many ways to 
obtain a healthier thinner body shape and lifestyle, but withhout any 
success.
 
When I graduated from college, my biggest wish was to help people. <br/><br/>I 
wanted to find a way that people can easily reach their ideal body 
shape. So I took a special interest in textiles, contacted different 
laboratories to investigate for clothing.
And it filled me with joy and motivation that I came step by step closer to my goal.
 
<br/><br/>Now after years, and of a lot of hard work and devotion, I have created 
this wonderful fabricfiber. I developt a fiber that is completely 
breathable, is comfortable to the touch, is ultra-thin, a very strong 
fabric and perfectly adapts to the body.
<br/><br/>This fiber is created exclusively from natural products only.
 
<br/><br/>My goal is to bring a product on to the market, that will bring a change
 in people's  life and bring them back their happiness.<br/><br/><b><span>The composition of this Product<br/></span></b><span>This fabricfiber remodels your body thanks to the action of microencapsulated active principles such as:<br/>- <b>Caffeine</b>, that stimulates the metabolism and it helps burn fat.<br/>- <b>Retinol and ceramides</b>, that strengthen and tightens the skin.<br/>- <b>Vitamine E</b>, which has an antioxidant effect synthesizing collagen.<br/>- <b>Aloe Vera</b>, that stimulates the microcirculation of blood and produce new cells giving light and hydration to the skin.<br/><br/><b><span>How do I use this product</span></b><br/>Great is that you can wear this product anytime and anywhere, for example under your jeans to improve your silhouette or when you make sport because it's very comfortable. You can see an immediate visible success. If you wear our product for 30 days 8 hours per day it reduces the girth while wearing 2 to 3 cm and also take care the skin and reduces fat. You also will notice that your orange skin diminishes. You feel lighter and full of energy and therefore happier and more confident with yourself.<br/><br/><b><span>How do I wash it</span></b><br/><span>I can wash it normally. <span>The integrated microcapsules remain effective for more than 100 washes</span></span>.<br/>It really works!<br/><br/></span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442323717/c5zefqz1lkrrshrplz4y.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 157px; height: 157px;""/>The short<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442323769/hov8i4vohsd8ooupcldt.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 156px; height: 156px;""/>The Capri<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442323799/sdf9xelzpdgidmuhowhz.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 174px; height: 174px;""/>The Leggings<br/></p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442323874/tvkjkfcshkuoltbzquwc.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 156px; height: 156px;""/>The T-Shirt<br/></p><br/><br/></div>","During my duration of study, a lot of my friends had been troubled with

I saw how my aunt was suffering everyday, she had tried so many ways to 
obtain a healthier thinner body shape and lifestyle, but withhout any 
success.
 
When I graduated from college, my biggest wish was to help people. I 
wanted to find a way that people can easily reach their ideal body 
shape. So I took a special interest in textiles, contacted different 
laboratories to investigate for clothing.
And it filled me with joy and motivation that I came step by step closer to my goal.
 
Now after years, and of a lot of hard work and devotion, I have created 
this wonderful fabricfiber. I developt a fiber that is completely 
breathable, is comfortable to the touch, is ultra-thin, a very strong 
fabric and perfectly adapts to the body.
This fiber is created exclusively from natural products only.
 
My goal is to bring a product on to the market, that will bring a change
 in people's  life and bring them back their happiness.The composition of this ProductThis fabricfiber remodels your body thanks to the action of microencapsulated active principles such as:- Caffeine, that stimulates the metabolism and it helps burn fat.- Retinol and ceramides, that strengthen and tightens the skin.- Vitamine E, which has an antioxidant effect synthesizing collagen.- Aloe Vera, that stimulates the microcirculation of blood and produce new cells giving light and hydration to the skin.How do I use this productGreat is that you can wear this product anytime and anywhere, for example under your jeans to improve your silhouette or when you make sport because it's very comfortable. You can see an immediate visible success. If you wear our product for 30 days 8 hours per day it reduces the girth while wearing 2 to 3 cm and also take care the skin and reduces fat. You also will notice that your orange skin diminishes. You feel lighter and full of energy and therefore happier and more confident with yourself.How do I wash itI can wash it normally. The integrated microcapsules remain effective for more than 100 washes.It really works!The shortThe CapriThe LeggingsThe T-Shirt",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Why Your Contribution is Important to Justina McCaffrey Haute Couture?</span></strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Your contribution will help me greatly because I will be able to show my new collection in the beautiful and professional manner demanded within the industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Although I was on hiatus from the industry for a year, many retailers are contacting me, wanting to purchase my gowns for their stores. They are also very enthusiastic to see my new collection.  Presenting at the New York Bridal show is the industry standard. All Haute Couture Bridal designers are expected to attend and present their line. Launching a new collection at the New York Bridal show is labor intensive and expensive. </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>New York International Bridal Market is the largest gathering of designers, and retailers and attracts buyers from all over the world. Currently I am consistently selling to a number of retailers in Japan, and the US. A lot of interest has also been expressed from additional buyers in the US and Europe.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Presenting at the New York International Bridal Market is the most cost effective way of seeing all these buyers in the same place. This campaign will make it easier for me to effectively market to the 500+ retailers that are in the category of selling luxury high-end wedding dresses.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Available Alternatives for Presentation of Collection</span></strong></h3>
<p>I am very thankful for any contribution and I acknowledge that these shows are very expensive to produce.  I believe in being as transparent as possible, and to accomplish this, the following illustrates the variegated prices within each type of showing.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$2000 – The Road Trip</span></strong></h3>
<p>This level of funding would not be able to finance a NY presentation during market week. It would allow me to travel by van to a limited number of targeted US states. The most effective strategy would be to travel from Boston to Baltimore with the dresses to meet and show buyers in their individual stores. A road trip however is far from what is expected of a high-end brand and could potentially diminish the value of brand in the eyes of the buyers.</p>

Why Your Contribution is Important to Justina McCaffrey Haute Couture?
 
Your contribution will help me greatly because I will be able to show my new collection in the beautiful and professional manner demanded within the industry.
 

Although I was on hiatus from the industry for a year, many retailers are contacting me, wanting to purchase my gowns for their stores. They are also very enthusiastic to see my new collection.  Presenting at the New York Bridal show is the industry standard. All Haute Couture Bridal designers are expected to attend and present their line. Launching a new collection at the New York Bridal show is labor intensive and expensive. 
 

New York International Bridal Market is the largest gathering of designers, and retailers and attracts buyers from all over the world. Currently I am consistently selling to a number of retailers in Japan, and the US. A lot of interest has also been expressed from additional buyers in the US and Europe.
 

Presenting at the New York International Bridal Market is the most cost effective way of seeing all these buyers in the same place. This campaign will make it easier for me to effectively market to the 500+ retailers that are in the category of selling luxury high-end wedding dresses.
 
 
Available Alternatives for Presentation of Collection
I am very thankful for any contribution and I acknowledge that these shows are very expensive to produce.  I believe in being as transparent as possible, and to accomplish this, the following illustrates the variegated prices within each type of showing.
 
$2000 – The Road Trip
This level of funding would not be able to finance a NY presentation during market week. It would allow me to travel by van to a limited number of targeted US states. The most effective strategy would be to travel from Boston to Baltimore with the dresses to meet and show buyers in their individual stores. A road trip however is far from what is expected of a high-end brand and could potentially diminish the value of brand in the eyes of the buyers.

IDEAL STRETCH GOAL – THE RUNWAY SHOW
 
$30,500 – The Runway Show and the 4-Day Showroom review
 
This facilitates a 4-day presentation that includes a runway show in the hotel ballroom, and appointment with retailers who have seen the show and are interested in coming back to review/get a closer look, and purchase sample dresses for their stores. There is no need for a showroom model because the fashion show shows how the dresses fit.
 
I have already been granted a specific date and time for the show, and it is strategically placed in a very favorable position between two other successful designers.
 
If I am not able to raise this money I will be forced to surrender and cancel this time slot.
