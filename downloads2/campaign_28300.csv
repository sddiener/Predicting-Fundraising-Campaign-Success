At Mainly Mozart, we have see first-hand that music can be a powerful spark in unleashing a child's potential. Research shows that playing a musical instrument inspires self-confidence, creativity and focus. It strengthens the parts of kids’ brains that process math and language skills, and allows for critical thinking. <p></p>
<p><b>“<i>Music makes me more confident about myself. I feel like I can actually do something that's worthwhile.</i></b>” <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">– Aaron, age 9</span></p>
<p>Our campaign is about giving San Diego kids the chance to unleash their own unique genius through the Mainly Mozart Youth Orchestra (MMYO). We serve all youth, ages 3-23, at all levels and from all backgrounds. We are also the only youth orchestra in the region that actively integrates children with learning disabilities into our core programs. In fact, up to 25% of our Orchestra students have special needs, and some of them are as young as three years old.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1217152/files/20150212095412-Teenage_violins_2.jpg?1423763652"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>

</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p><b>Here is just one example of the difference that music can make in the life of a child:</b></p><p>When five-year-old Ali, born with Down Syndrome, first began attending Mainly Mozart Youth Orchestra rehearsals, she was shy and quiet; she struggled with her motor skills, and was afraid of interacting with her fellow student musicians.</p><p>Despite the challenges she faced, Ali’s mother brought her to rehearsal every Saturday morning, and encouraged her to pick up her violin and play. Surrounded by children of all ages and all abilities, learning the music of Mozart and the Masters, is where Ali’s transformation began.</p><p>In June, this child who struggled to make eye contact a few months earlier, performed for an audience of a thousand people at the Balboa Theatre.</p><p>These days Ali, who was hesitant with language before coming to MMYO, bursts into rehearsals every week with a “Hi, Miss Jane” for her beloved teacher. And, when the time comes for ensembles to participate in games and activities, Ali now races to be first in line with the other children.</p><p>Since joining MMYO, Ali has become fully verbal, has transformed socially, and has even begun to read music.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1217171/files/20150212100350-Little_Violinists.jpg?1423764230"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Your support will make a difference!</h3><div>

<h3>WHY
SUPPORT THE MAINLY MOZART YOUTH ORCHESTRA?</h3>
<p><b>“I don’t have
music at my school.”</b> – Kacie, age 6</p>
<p>With budget cuts and
reduced funding for the arts, music education programs in schools have been eliminated,
resources for children living in underserved communities have been minimized,
and creative outlets for our children have all but disappeared.</p>
<p>The Mainly Mozart Youth Orchestra gives our
children what our school system can’t: rigorous musical training by the world’s
top musicians, inclusive programs for all ages and abilities, and a focused
environment for serious young musicians.</p>
<p><i><b>The
Mainly Mozart Youth Orchestra needs to raise $15,000 by April 10, 2015 to successfully
take us through our second season.</b></i></p>

</div></div>","Every child has a unique genius.

At Mainly Mozart, we have see first-hand that music can be a powerful spark in unleashing a child's potential. Research shows that playing a musical instrument inspires self-confidence, creativity and focus. It strengthens the parts of kids’ brains that process math and language skills, and allows for critical thinking. 
“Music makes me more confident about myself. I feel like I can actually do something that's worthwhile.” – Aaron, age 9
Our campaign is about giving San Diego kids the chance to unleash their own unique genius through the Mainly Mozart Youth Orchestra (MMYO). We serve all youth, ages 3-23, at all levels and from all backgrounds. We are also the only youth orchestra in the region that actively integrates children with learning disabilities into our core programs. In fact, up to 25% of our Orchestra students have special needs, and some of them are as young as three years old.

HOW IS MMYO CHANGING LIVES?


Here is just one example of the difference that music can make in the life of a child:When five-year-old Ali, born with Down Syndrome, first began attending Mainly Mozart Youth Orchestra rehearsals, she was shy and quiet; she struggled with her motor skills, and was afraid of interacting with her fellow student musicians.Despite the challenges she faced, Ali’s mother brought her to rehearsal every Saturday morning, and encouraged her to pick up her violin and play. Surrounded by children of all ages and all abilities, learning the music of Mozart and the Masters, is where Ali’s transformation began.In June, this child who struggled to make eye contact a few months earlier, performed for an audience of a thousand people at the Balboa Theatre.These days Ali, who was hesitant with language before coming to MMYO, bursts into rehearsals every week with a “Hi, Miss Jane” for her beloved teacher. And, when the time comes for ensembles to participate in games and activities, Ali now races to be first in line with the other children.Since joining MMYO, Ali has become fully verbal, has transformed socially, and has even begun to read music.Your support will make a difference!

Two donations of $40 provides an hour of one-on-one
coaching to young musicians with special needs such as Autism Spectrum Disorder
and Down Syndrome
Ten donations of $75 can provide a year-long music scholarship to a family in need
ANY amount helps to ensure prestigious performance
opportunities year-round for all of our students, including the chance to play
at The Balboa Theatre during the Mainly Mozart Festival

WHY
SUPPORT THE MAINLY MOZART YOUTH ORCHESTRA?
“I don’t have
music at my school.” – Kacie, age 6
With budget cuts and
reduced funding for the arts, music education programs in schools have been eliminated,
resources for children living in underserved communities have been minimized,
and creative outlets for our children have all but disappeared.
The Mainly Mozart Youth Orchestra gives our
children what our school system can’t: rigorous musical training by the world’s
top musicians, inclusive programs for all ages and abilities, and a focused
environment for serious young musicians.
The
Mainly Mozart Youth Orchestra needs to raise $15,000 by April 10, 2015 to successfully
take us through our second season.

Since the end of World War II, many individual researchers, newspapers, and military agencies have recorded thousands of incidents involving aerial phenomena, often called UFOs. These accounts gave rise to much speculation about flying saucers, visitors from other planets and alien abductions, generally thought to be a recent development.

These accounts share definite physical features  -- such as the complex evolution of the objects in flight, their spherical or discoid shape and their luminous characteristics -- that have changed little over the centuries, yet have remained unexplained. This work charts a complete chronology, ensuring that cases meet a standard measure of credibility via a specific person on the record having witnessed an event at a specific time and place.</span></p>

<div style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Sage thinkers have noted that revolutions in thought, scientific or otherwise, are wrought when anomalies are noted and then finally explained. But what does one do when an anomaly continues to show up over thousands of years in the skies above us -- and yet there remains no consistent explanation?! Absent a formal explanation a diligent scientist in today’s era would first chronicle the history, verify the data with best practices, and then provide an objective recounting of the case facts.  That is at least what should happen…</span><br/><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In that vein this newly updated Edition of </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Wonders in the Sky</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> provides a riveting historical framework for a vexing anomaly—that of unexplained aerial objects and, by implication, the potential reasons (intelligence?) behind them. Starting as far back as 1460 BC, Vallée and Aubeck, in magnificent detail, provide a gallery of unexplained aerial phenomena as chronicled by a range of individuals—whether common folk, generals of the day, members of their armies, scientists and astronomers, or leaders of cities or even religions. What is compellingly brought out in </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Wonders in the Sky</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> are the similarities of the recorded experiences juxtaposed against the extraordinary variety of interpretations by the participants who recorded them. What have these people seen? Why is it there? Is it similar to what is seen today and if not, why not?</span><br/><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Meticulous attention to scientific detail is a hallmark of Vallée’s books, and </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Wonders in the Sky</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> is a case study in objectivity. By never allowing their writing, or their reader, to fall into the trap of a foregone conclusion, Vallée and Aubeck enable the broadest set of hypotheses to remain on the table. Such focus is what makes this new edition of </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Wonders in the Sky</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> a landmark on the history of unexplained aerial objects. And it should be a case study in the scientific literature of how to avoid dogma while still leaving open the wonders of what role we play in a larger reality.</span> </span></span></div>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>""A beautiful synthesis of the humanities and sciences""</b></h3> <p>Anyone who has dipped into the world of ufology knows just how difficult it is to find an able guide through the dark deep forest of the phenomena, which are diverse, confusing, and often, or so it seems, intentionally confusing. Two beacons high above this forest have been the work of Jacques Vallée and the web-based “Magoniax” research team of Chris Aubeck and his colleagues. The present project, a gorgeously produced new edition of <i>Wonders in the Sky</i>, brings the two together again as they scan human history from antiquity to 1879 for evidence of unexplained aerial objects. In the process, they resist any easy answers or pat interpretations, preferring instead to sit with the historical data in all its complexity and mystery, to listen, as it were, to the historian of religions as closely as the astronomer. The result is a beautiful synthesis of the humanities and the sciences, of the human imagination and the computer, of the visual arts and the art of scholarship. From the striking painting on the cover, which depicts a mysterious object painted on an Italian ceiling in 1561, to the sharp, clear thinking of the text, to the playful medieval symbols attached to each case, the book sets a new standard, and a new aesthetic, for the still developing conversation.</p>

 The goal of this campaign is to publish a collector's limited edition of Wonders in the Sky. And by supporting this project you will be supporting UFO research. Help us facilitate future investigations. Thus far 143 books have been claimed! There are 357 copies that remain available.
 

 

Research has flourished...from collections and museums all over the world 


Research has flourished in the last five years, with remarkable material added and unique color images obtained from collections and museums all over the world. With the manuscript completed, and the prototype prepared, we now need your help to independently publish this next generation of Wonders that takes the study and research of UFOs to a higher level. We hope you will support our campaign and come to love your book for both its artistic beauty and scientific merit. 
Only 500 Signed and Numbered Copies
This new unique Limited Edition (only 500 signed, numbered and slipcased copies will ever be produced) represents the culmination of many years of exhaustive scientific research. Since the original publication of Wonders in the Sky, two of the world's leading UFO researchers Chris Aubeck and Jacques Vallée have continued to investigate both new and existing cases with the help of a group of experts on the internet. New cases have been researched and appear in this work for the first time (Penguin produced a paperback version in 2010). Meanwhile other cases have been expanded following further investigation, and some cases from the original work have been removed as additional research proved that they lacked merit.  
To hear more about Dr. Vallée's research, just click here and here for two videos; a panel about outer space at a global financial conference in Saudi Arabia and a TED talk in Geneva on Futures Research, respectively.
 420 Selected Reports The book you receive will contain more than 420 selected reports of sightings from biblical-age antiquity through the year 1879 -- the point at which the Industrial Revolution deeply changed the nature of human society with the invention of the dirigible, airplanes, rockets, and various prototypes increasing the opportunity for confusion and misinterpretation of new technology as UFOs.

 The Phenomenon Did Not Begin in 1947

 
As some of you may not be familiar with the original version of Wonders and its research, the following will serve as additional background on the concept. Since the end of World War II, many individual researchers, newspapers, and military agencies have recorded thousands of incidents involving aerial phenomena, often called UFOs. These accounts gave rise to much speculation about flying saucers, visitors from other planets and alien abductions, generally thought to be a recent development. Yet the phenomenon did not begin in the present era.Jacques Vallée and Chris Aubeck reveal a thread of vividly rendered -- and sometimes strikingly similar -- reports of mysterious aerial phenomena from antiquity through the modern age. These accounts share definite physical features  -- such as the complex evolution of the objects in flight, their spherical or discoid shape and their luminous characteristics -- that have changed little over the centuries, yet have remained unexplained. This work charts a complete chronology, ensuring that cases meet a standard measure of credibility via a specific person on the record having witnessed an event at a specific time and place.

                 

                Mirabilis Annus: Progression of the UFO ""wave"" of 1660-61 in England

 
  


The work of Jacques and Chris has received widespread praise for its scientific approach to the study of UFOs. A few of these endorsements are provided here.
 
 
""A riveting historical framework""
Sage thinkers have noted that revolutions in thought, scientific or otherwise, are wrought when anomalies are noted and then finally explained. But what does one do when an anomaly continues to show up over thousands of years in the skies above us -- and yet there remains no consistent explanation?! Absent a formal explanation a diligent scientist in today’s era would first chronicle the history, verify the data with best practices, and then provide an objective recounting of the case facts.  That is at least what should happen…In that vein this newly updated Edition of Wonders in the Sky provides a riveting historical framework for a vexing anomaly—that of unexplained aerial objects and, by implication, the potential reasons (intelligence?) behind them. Starting as far back as 1460 BC, Vallée and Aubeck, in magnificent detail, provide a gallery of unexplained aerial phenomena as chronicled by a range of individuals—whether common folk, generals of the day, members of their armies, scientists and astronomers, or leaders of cities or even religions. What is compellingly brought out in Wonders in the Sky are the similarities of the recorded experiences juxtaposed against the extraordinary variety of interpretations by the participants who recorded them. What have these people seen? Why is it there? Is it similar to what is seen today and if not, why not?Meticulous attention to scientific detail is a hallmark of Vallée’s books, and Wonders in the Sky is a case study in objectivity. By never allowing their writing, or their reader, to fall into the trap of a foregone conclusion, Vallée and Aubeck enable the broadest set of hypotheses to remain on the table. Such focus is what makes this new edition of Wonders in the Sky a landmark on the history of unexplained aerial objects. And it should be a case study in the scientific literature of how to avoid dogma while still leaving open the wonders of what role we play in a larger reality. 
 
-Dr. Garry Nolan, Rachford and Carlota Harris Professor of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University 
 
""A beautiful synthesis of the humanities and sciences"" Anyone who has dipped into the world of ufology knows just how difficult it is to find an able guide through the dark deep forest of the phenomena, which are diverse, confusing, and often, or so it seems, intentionally confusing. Two beacons high above this forest have been the work of Jacques Vallée and the web-based “Magoniax” research team of Chris Aubeck and his colleagues. The present project, a gorgeously produced new edition of Wonders in the Sky, brings the two together again as they scan human history from antiquity to 1879 for evidence of unexplained aerial objects. In the process, they resist any easy answers or pat interpretations, preferring instead to sit with the historical data in all its complexity and mystery, to listen, as it were, to the historian of religions as closely as the astronomer. The result is a beautiful synthesis of the humanities and the sciences, of the human imagination and the computer, of the visual arts and the art of scholarship. From the striking painting on the cover, which depicts a mysterious object painted on an Italian ceiling in 1561, to the sharp, clear thinking of the text, to the playful medieval symbols attached to each case, the book sets a new standard, and a new aesthetic, for the still developing conversation.
  -Dr. Jeffrey J. Kripal, J. Newton Rayzor Professor of Religion, Rice University


 
 
 
""That, I believe, is true science: to follow the data wherever they lead""

Their rigorously scientific insistence allows Vallée and Aubeck to retain the most challenging and interesting aspects of these events without the distraction of premature commitment to any particular interpretation. That, I believe, is true science: to follow the data wherever they lead, and to move away from established theory when it fails to deal adequately with the data.The other beautiful innovation in Vallée and Aubeck’s work is the combination of science and scholarship. A willingness to combine documentary research, the heart of humanities scholarship, with physical and astrophysical knowledge is rare.”

These images have been rendered from high quality digital images to create a work of lasting beauty as well as science. Towards this end, you will also receive the following special items for your contribution:A facsimile commemorative token (coin) of French origin from 1648 depicting a legendary shield from the sky
                                             The token pictured above, which was struck in 1648, shows a disk with a thick border. This kind of object or medal (“jeton” in French) has been mentioned in books and magazine articles as a flying shield either observed in the clouds, passing over a wide landscape or (as in this case) protecting it from spears directed at its curved surface from the sky. The jeton is a little larger than a U.S. quarter and is similar to many tokens produced in Europe around that time for religious and educational purposes. Rather than a flying saucer (some sort of “Roman Roswell,” as some have suggested), it is thought to represent the “Shield of Numa.” It is said that on March 1st, 707 BC, during the outbreak of a plague, the second king of Rome, Numa Pompilius, witnessed the fall of an oval shield from the sky during a ceremony. Somewhat astonished, he sought advice from the nymph Egeria and the nine Muses, who assured him that Jupiter had dropped it as a sign of his benevolence. The pestilence soon came to an end, so the grateful king had eleven identical copies made by an armourer, and those were used in dances and celebrations every year. Written around the edges of this coin is the Latin phrase “Resistit paucis obruitur pluribus,” which means “It withstands a few but is overwhelmed by the many.” Reports of such “flying shields” figure prominently in Wonders in the Sky. We believe this intriguing coin is a worthy accessory minted in support of the research. A folder of rare 17th and 18th century European broadsheets and placards Presented are a folder of rare broadsheets, the newspapers of the time, that functioned as mass media, most of them from 17th and 18th century Germany, depicting celestial events observed in central Europe, France and Italy. Produced in facsimile, each one consists of an engraving of the scene (typically enhanced with mythological, allegorical or religious figures) with a text explaining the significance of the event for the benefit of the public. These records have taken the form of paintings on the walls of caves, carvings in stone walls, statues and stelae, or writings on papyrus and parchment. After the invention of paper and the printing press, the observations could be shared with an eager and curious public. This led to widely distributed poster-size documents known as broadsheets, broadsides or placards. These were posted as notices in a public place or sold as individual sheets. Please see two of the placards below, and enjoy these rare items that are both pieces of art and critical components of the historical UFO record.

<p>En janvier 2016, le <b>Jackie Pall - Theater Group</b> (JPTG) s’envole vers Santiago du Chili. Nous partons sous l’aile de notre <b>parrain Oscar Castro</b>, grande figure de la révolution culturelle chilienne,

Castro a recréé le <b>Théâtre Aleph Chili</b> (TAC) avec Gabriela Olguin à qui le gouvernement 
a confié les clés d'une bâtisse en plein 
cœur de Santiago, en salut et gratitude de ses actions menées sur le territoire chilien depuis plus de 40 ans. Une grande maison nous attend, <b>un lieu de Vie(s) et de Culture(s) en devenir</b>, que le JPTG se propose d’investir et de concrétiser en collaboration avec le TAC.</p>

<p><b>-&gt; Réhabilitation de la maison de Santiago</b> :</p>
<p><b>^^^</b>  L’inventivité doit être le maître-mot du chantier. Privilégier la récupération et le « système D » pour adopter des façons intelligentes et économes de rénovation. Par exemple, l’utilisation de matériaux comme la paille, la terre ou le bambou, qui semblent être à la fois écologiques et économiques, mais aussi la création de notre propre peinture à base de caséine et de chaux, ou encore la confection de briques à base de paille et de boue. Il sera néanmoins nécessaire d’acheter certains éléments de base (quincaillerie, outils, …)</p>

<p><b>^^^</b>  Ensemble nous organiserons rapidement les espaces intérieurs et extérieurs qui devront être rapidement aménagés pour accueillir les premiers visiteurs et créer un lieu propice à l’échange et au partage.

<p><b>-&gt;</b> Si le JPTG sollicite un financement participatif via Indiegogo, c’est toujours dans l’idée que le <b>rassemblement des individualités et des moyens</b> autour d’un <b>objet commun et partagé</b> est une force nécessaire pour réaliser ses désirs. Nous avons la conviction que cette envie n’est pas simplement celle du JPTG, mais qu’elle peut être un <b>rêve commun</b>, ouvrant la voie à de nouvelles manières de <b>créer</b>, d’<b>échanger</b>, de <b>regarder, </b>d’<b>écouter </b>et<b> </b>d’<b>envisager la ville</b>, son paysage, ses populations. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span>C’est pourquoi nous faisons appel à votre participation, pour relever <b>un défi qui dépasse l’ambition individuelle</b> d’un groupe, pour jeter les bases d’un projet ouvert, encore plein de questionnements et d’inconnu, mais <b>réel et à portée de main</b>.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<br/><p>En enero
de 2016, el <b>Jackie Pall - Theater Group</b>(JPTG)  viaja a
Santiago de Chile. Partimos  bajo el
auspicio   de nuestro padrino Oscar Castro, gran
figura  de la revolución cultural
chilena, <b>fundador del Teatro Aleph</b> y
director del Teatro  Aleph en Ivry sur
Seine. En 2013, Oscar Castro  creó de
nuevo  el <b> Teatro Aleph Chile</b>(TAC) con  Gabriela Olguin  a 
quién el gobierno chileno entregó 
las llaves de una casa en pleno centro de Santiago, en reconocimiento a
las acciones realizadas en el territorio chileno desde hace más de 40 años. Una
casa grande nos espera, <b>un lugar de
Vida(s) y de Cultura(s) en pleno crecimiento, </b>que el JPTG<b> </b>se
propone desarrollar, en conjonto con el TAC.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Con la finalidad de <b> rehabilitar </b> y 
empezar<b> las actividades, </b>el
JPTG abre una plataforma de financiación participativa. </p>

<p>Nuestro
grupo se reúne alrededor de esta reflexión: <i>la
gente se aleja cada día más de la cultura bajo todas sus expresiones. No le tocaría
a la cultura  desplazar sus fronteras
espaciales, sociales y económicas?</i></p>
<p>Para responder a esta problemática, <b> invadimos desde  hace cinco años  lugares 
en actividad o desocupados</b> (fabricas, escuelas, museos, centros
administrativos…) para proponer formas <b>artísticas
y artesanales </b> que darán vida a los
muros con un enfoque, una <b> mirada  aún
desconocidos del gran público.</b></p>
<p>Intentamos otorgar un valor nuevo a los lugares
pertenecientes a los ciudadanos, al barrio, a la ciudad, al país. Por eso,
nuestro propósito consiste  en dedicar el
tiempo  necesario para comunicar, intercambiar
y compartir con los habitantes; entenderlos y descubrirlos para  fomentar las creaciones pensadas <b>PARA/POR / y CON</b> ellas.</p>
<p><b>Todos juntos, recreamos lazos apoyándonos mutuamente en los
conocimientos y la experiencia de cada uno.</b></p>
<p>Por eso, nos basamos en el dogma siguiente que
permite reunir a todos los integrantes alrededor de un lenguaje común de  creación:</p>
<p><i>1 – Dar al público un rol
que lo hace  imprescindible para la obra
teatral.</i></p>
<p><i>2_ Concebir  los objetivos  y la espacialidad dramatúrgica de una obra en relación
con  la organización  cotidiana y/o histórica de una estructura no
dedicada al arte originalmente</i></p>
<p><i> 3_ Pensar la comunicación sobre la obra como
propuesta artística y plástica de pleno derecho, que se represente a ella
misma.</i></p>
<p><i>4_ liberarse geopolíticamente
de las corrientes que enclaustran.</i></p>
<p><i>5_comprometerse con la
utilización del material estrictamente mínimo y 
necesario.</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<p><b>-&gt; Rehabilitación de la casa de Santiago:</b></p>
<p>^^^ La creatividad deberá ser el eje motor de la cantera.
Privilegiar la recuperación de material para adoptar maneras inteligentes y
económicas de renovación. Por ejemplo utilización de materiales tales que la
paja, la tierra o la caña, que parecen ser a la vez ecológicos y económicos,
pero también  la creación de nuestra
propia pintura a base de caseína y de cal, o la fabricación de adobes. Sin embargo
será necesario comprar elementos de base (ferretería, herramientas... )</p>
<p>^^^ Juntos, organizaremos rápidamente los espacios
interiores y exteriores tendrán que ser rápidamente organizados para acoger a
los primeros visitantes y crear un lugar propicio al intercambio y al
compartir. Hemos pensado por ejemplo en la construcción de un bar  efímero de madera, la instalación de baños
suplementarios, la compra y/o 
recuperación y renovación de camas y colchas para alojarse en  la casa</p>

En janvier 2016, le Jackie Pall - Theater Group (JPTG) s’envole vers Santiago du Chili. Nous partons sous l’aile de notre parrain Oscar Castro, grande figure de la révolution culturelle chilienne, 
fondateur
du Théâtre Aleph et directeur du Théâtre Aleph à Ivry sur Seine. En 2013, Oscar
Castro a recréé le Théâtre Aleph Chili (TAC) avec Gabriela Olguin à qui le gouvernement 
a confié les clés d'une bâtisse en plein 
cœur de Santiago, en salut et gratitude de ses actions menées sur le territoire chilien depuis plus de 40 ans. Une grande maison nous attend, un lieu de Vie(s) et de Culture(s) en devenir, que le JPTG se propose d’investir et de concrétiser en collaboration avec le TAC.
C'est pour la réhabilitation et le démarrage des activités que le JPTG lance une plateforme de financement participatif.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Pour connaître Oscar et son histoire : On s'aimait tant à Santiago - 1988) 




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHEZ JACKIE PALL - LIEU DE VIE(S) ET DE CULTURE(S)                                         est un endroit pensé pour que chaque « fréquentant » des murs puisse                      
rencontrer + créer + échanger + fabriquer + partager + danser + réparer + écouter + manger + regarder + (se) cultiver + (se) divertir
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*** LE JACKIE PALL - THEATER GROUP *** est une communauté constituée d'artistes pluridisciplinaires (théâtre, cinéma, musique, danse, dessin, sculpture, photo), d'artisans (cuisiniers, compagnons du devoir) et créateurs en tout genre (agri-designeuse, ingénieur sonore, chef opérateur, techniciens, bénévoles, architecte, brasseur) qui aiment à se retrouver, à partager et à vivre des événements culturels, ludiques et festifs dans des lieux qui ne sont pas dédiés à la culture au départ. (jackiepalltheatergroup.com)
(c) Studio Rivage

Notre groupe se concentre sur le constat suivant :  la population prend de plus en plus de distance avec la culture sous toutes ses formes. Ne serait-ce pas à la culture de déplacer ses frontières spatiales, sociales et économiques? 

Pour répondre à ce questionnement, nous investissons depuis cinq ans des lieux en activité ou en friche (usines, écoles, musées, centres administratifs...) pour y proposer des formes artistiques et artisanales par lesquelles l'architecture va prendre vie sous un angle, un regard encore méconnu du grand public.             Nous tentons de donner une nouvelle valeur aux lieux, au quartier, à la ville, au pays, propres aux citoyens. Pour cela, notre démarche consiste à prendre le temps de communiquer, échanger et vivre avec les populations ; de les comprendre, de les découvrir pour donner naissance à des créations pensées POUR / PAR / et AVEC elles. 

Tous ensemble nous recréons du lien en s'appuyant sur le savoir faire et le savoir vivre de chacun.

En cela nous nous appuyons sur le dogme suivant, qui permet la concentration de tous ses participants autour d'un même langage de création :


  - 1 - Donner au public
une place qui le rend nécessaire à la représentation                     - 2 -
Concevoir les enjeux et la spatialisation dramaturgiques d’une œuvre, relativement à l’organisation quotidienne et/ou historique d’une structure non
dédiée à l’art au départ                                                                                                                       - 3 - Penser une communication sur l’œuvre, comme une proposition artistique et
plastique à part entière, qui soit en représentation d’elle-même                                        - 4 -
Se dégager géopolitiquement des courants qui enferment                                       
- 5 - Se donner la gageure du strict minimum matériel nécessaire
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                
*** LE JACKIE PALL - THEATER GROUP ***                                                          vous invite à partager avec eux la concrétisation de                                                              "" Chez Jackie Pall - Lieu de Vie(s) et de Culture(s) ""                                                          

Dans un désir de faire naître à l'échelle d'un lieu toutes nos ambitions artistiques et humaines, nous nous concentrons sur la réhabilitation d'une friche depuis plusieurs années, dans une politique urbaine ambitieuse, pour y développer des activités culturelles territoriales novatrices, tant des points de vues artistiques, urbanistiques, logistiques qu'économiques. 


Aujourd'hui Oscar Castro nous invite à tenter l'expérience de                               ""Chez Jackie Pall - Lieu de Vie(s) et de Culture(s)"" dans cet établissement         en collaboration avec le Théâtre Aleph Chili qu'il a fondé en 2013 à Santiago, avec comme objectif d'échanger des connaissances et d'enrichir réciproquement nos expériences .


Notre équipe est composée de 11 intervenants (artistes, artisans, techniciens) français ; nous nous y rendons pour découvrir les 1000m2 de terrain qui nous sont alloués, dont 350m2 de bâtisse sur deux niveaux.



*** LE THEATRE ALEPH CHILI (TAC) *** réunit autour d’Oscar
Castro, fondateur du Théâtre Aleph, et de Gabriela Olguin, comédienne du Théâtre Aleph, une dizaine de jeunes comédiens des quartiers populaires de Santiago, autour d’un projet de théâtre communautaire,
populaire, humaniste et festif. Il présente régulièrement des spectacles
d’Oscar Castro à Santiago et organise des ateliers de théâtre avec les
populations des quartiers populaires de la région métropolitaine, dans
le cadre du Festival Mil Veces Metropolitano, créé et organisé par le TAC, qui
a lieu tous les ans depuis 2012.

A travers Chez Jackie Pall - Lugar de Vida(s) y de Cultura(s)                                  le JPTG et le TAC proposent une plateforme de financement participatif                 où le contributeur/spectateur propose et/ou assiste aux avancées***                            de l'ouverture du lieu, dont les enjeux sont les suivants :                                                                          -> Collaboration JPTG / Théâtre Aleph Chili (TAC) : Derniers travaux de réhabilitation (intérieur et extérieur) visant à accueillir quotidiennement les deux équipes dans leur lieu de vie. Créations artistiques pluridisciplinaires mêlant artistes français et chiliens, amateurs et professionnels, à travers notamment la recréation du Kabaret de la dernière chance, pièce écrite par Oscar Castro en 1986.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
-> Implantation territoriale de quartier : rencontre avec les associations locales     (artistiques, artisanales, sociales) et les partenaires de vie quotidienne (commerces de proximité, maraîchers)                                                                                                                                                                -> Travail de (re)cherche sur l'histoire du lieu, du quartier, de la ville, du pays.           Archivage quotidien de l'évolution de la maison par écrits, photos, vidéos, audios  (sur cette photo, conversation Skype avec le TAC, qui nous présente les anciens propriétaires de la maison)                                                                                      
-> Voyage à travers le Chili (Valparaiso, désert d'Atacama) à la rencontre des artistes, artisans et populations locales, en restituant sur une carte interactive  internet notre parcours à travers le pays                                                                                                                                                                
-> Création des premiers événements éphémères, pluridisciplinaires, ouverts,    ludiques, festifs et intergénérationnels visant à planter les fondations du lieu en devenir                                                                                                                                                     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




CONCRÈTEMENT CET ARGENT SERVIRA À :




-> Réhabilitation de la maison de Santiago :
^^^  L’inventivité doit être le maître-mot du chantier. Privilégier la récupération et le « système D » pour adopter des façons intelligentes et économes de rénovation. Par exemple, l’utilisation de matériaux comme la paille, la terre ou le bambou, qui semblent être à la fois écologiques et économiques, mais aussi la création de notre propre peinture à base de caséine et de chaux, ou encore la confection de briques à base de paille et de boue. Il sera néanmoins nécessaire d’acheter certains éléments de base (quincaillerie, outils, …)




^^^  Ensemble nous organiserons rapidement les espaces intérieurs et extérieurs qui devront être rapidement aménagés pour accueillir les premiers visiteurs et créer un lieu propice à l’échange et au partage. Nous envisageons par exemple la construction d'un bar éphémère en bois, l’installation de sanitaires supplémentaires, l’achat et/ou la récupération et remise en état des literies pour s’installer dans la maison…




-> Travail de terrain et archivage / Rencontre avec professionnels et amateurs locaux, régionaux, nationaux : 
^^^  Location d'un mini-bus
^^^   Frais d’essence
^^^   Frais d’hébergements hors Santiago




-> Création d’évènements dans le lieu enfin investi : 
^^^   Achat / location ou remise en état de matériel technique                       (lumières, hauts-parleurs, équipements électriques…)
^^^   Interventions / diffusion urbaines                                                                       (collages de rue format géant, vidéoprojection extérieure…)
^^^  Accueil du public                                                                                               (restauration, buvette…)



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




À ce jour, le Jackie Pall - Theater Group est nourri d'expériences concrètes, de bases d'expérimentations riches, pour prétendre en proposer de nouvelles, plus denses, à l'échelle d'un lieu dont le fonctionnement dépend de leur identité :



*** En septembre 2015, le JPTG s’installe à l’A.E.R.I. (Atelier - Expérience - Redynamisation - Insertion), un lieu associatif qui depuis 25 ans propose des stages d'art thérapie aux marginaux de notre société. Né de l’investissement de ce lieu, Pendant que les champs brûlent  propose à travers 4 soirées :                                       * une série d’installations créées d'après les archives d'une année de réflexions quotidiennes                                                                                                                                          * une pièce où artistes, artisans et invités s'agitent sur une scène autour d'une histoire collective qu'ils inventent en relation étroite avec les visiteurs                        * un repas servi sur place pour l’ensemble du public                                                        * une fête où les murs réinvestis deviennent un lieu d’échanges et de rencontres.



*** Entre décembre 2014 et juin 2015, Le Kabaret de la dernière chance, est représenté 7 fois au Théâtre Aleph d’Ivry-sur-Seine. Une expérience théâtrale mêlant comédiens professionnels, amateurs, amis et musiciens, invitant chaque soir de nouvelles personnes venues d’horizons différents, rassemblant la scène et le public dans une même énergie créatrice et festive.






*** En 2013-2014, Caudry Factory réunit une équipe de 10 artistes concentrés à travailler ensemble autour de l’industrie de la dentelle (activité emblématique de la ville de Caudry), leur thématique commune. Les « prises de vie » récoltées des mois durant ont finalement mobilisé l’équipe au coeur de la ville par diverses actions artistiques telles que des collages de rue, le tournage d'un long-métrage, une projection ciné-drive, un ballet orchestré par l’harmonie locale, une installation, des émissions radio, une pièce à double sens...



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** Le contributeur/spectateur propose et/ou assiste aux avancées *** 


-> Si le JPTG sollicite un financement participatif via Indiegogo, c’est toujours dans l’idée que le rassemblement des individualités et des moyens autour d’un objet commun et partagé est une force nécessaire pour réaliser ses désirs. Nous avons la conviction que cette envie n’est pas simplement celle du JPTG, mais qu’elle peut être un rêve commun, ouvrant la voie à de nouvelles manières de créer, d’échanger, de regarder, d’écouter et d’envisager la ville, son paysage, ses populations. C’est pourquoi nous faisons appel à votre participation, pour relever un défi qui dépasse l’ambition individuelle d’un groupe, pour jeter les bases d’un projet ouvert, encore plein de questionnements et d’inconnu, mais réel et à portée de main.



-> De même que nous considérons comme fondamental l'investissement et l'ouverture des lieux, qu'ils soient ouverts et accessibles à tous, quels que soient les moyens financiers, les contreparties proposées aux donateurs / participants de Chez Jackie Pall - Lugar de Vida(s) y de Cultura(s) seront les mêmes pour tous, que le don s’élève de 
de 1 $ à 1000 $  .             

-> Nous choisissons de récolter la somme en $$$ afin que les contributeurs des deux pays (France et Chili) puissent participer sans aucune difficulté de paiement. Chaque participant peut contribuer dans sa devise et n'a pas nécessairement besoin de se créer un compte PayPal.

Ainsi, nous nous engageons à proposer chaque
semaine un compte-rendu des avancées du projet sur place, par des propositions
artistiques personnalisées (sous forme de vidéos, photos, enregistrements
sonores)                                   via des liens internet privés que seuls les contributeurs pourront consulter 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          1,00$ = 0,9 €  /  20,00 $ = 18 €  /  50,00 $ = 45 €  /   100,00 $ = 91 €                                   200,00 $ = 182 €  /  500,00 $ = 457 €  /  1000,00 $ = 913 €

En enero
de 2016, el Jackie Pall - Theater Group(JPTG)  viaja a
Santiago de Chile. Partimos  bajo el
auspicio   de nuestro padrino Oscar Castro, gran
figura  de la revolución cultural
chilena, fundador del Teatro Aleph y
director del Teatro  Aleph en Ivry sur
Seine. En 2013, Oscar Castro  creó de
nuevo  el  Teatro Aleph Chile(TAC) con  Gabriela Olguin  a 
quién el gobierno chileno entregó 
las llaves de una casa en pleno centro de Santiago, en reconocimiento a
las acciones realizadas en el territorio chileno desde hace más de 40 años. Una
casa grande nos espera, un lugar de
Vida(s) y de Cultura(s) en pleno crecimiento, que el JPTG se
propone desarrollar, en conjonto con el TAC.


Con la finalidad de  rehabilitar  y 
empezar las actividades, el
JPTG abre una plataforma de financiación participativa. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a Oscar y su trayectoria : On s'aimait tant à Santiago - 1988)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***El  JACKIE PALL -
THEATER GROUP *** es una comunidad
constituida por artistas pluridisciplinarios (teatro, cine, música, baile,
dibujo, escultura, foto) por artesanos (cocineros, compañeros del deber) y creadores
de todo tipo (agri-disenadora- ingeniero sonido, jefe operador, técnicos,
benévolos, arquitecto,cervecero) a quienes les gusta reunirse, compartir y
convivir eventos culturales, lúdicos y festivos en lugares que originalmente
no están dedicados a la cultura. (jackiepalltheatergroup.com)
(c) Studio Rivage
Nuestro
grupo se reúne alrededor de esta reflexión: la
gente se aleja cada día más de la cultura bajo todas sus expresiones. No le tocaría
a la cultura  desplazar sus fronteras
espaciales, sociales y económicas?
Para responder a esta problemática,  invadimos desde  hace cinco años  lugares 
en actividad o desocupados (fabricas, escuelas, museos, centros
administrativos…) para proponer formas artísticas
y artesanales  que darán vida a los
muros con un enfoque, una  mirada  aún
desconocidos del gran público.
Intentamos otorgar un valor nuevo a los lugares
pertenecientes a los ciudadanos, al barrio, a la ciudad, al país. Por eso,
nuestro propósito consiste  en dedicar el
tiempo  necesario para comunicar, intercambiar
y compartir con los habitantes; entenderlos y descubrirlos para  fomentar las creaciones pensadas PARA/POR / y CON ellas.
Todos juntos, recreamos lazos apoyándonos mutuamente en los
conocimientos y la experiencia de cada uno.
Por eso, nos basamos en el dogma siguiente que
permite reunir a todos los integrantes alrededor de un lenguaje común de  creación:
1 – Dar al público un rol
que lo hace  imprescindible para la obra
teatral.
2_ Concebir  los objetivos  y la espacialidad dramatúrgica de una obra en relación
con  la organización  cotidiana y/o histórica de una estructura no
dedicada al arte originalmente
 3_ Pensar la comunicación sobre la obra como
propuesta artística y plástica de pleno derecho, que se represente a ella
misma.
4_ liberarse geopolíticamente
de las corrientes que enclaustran.
5_comprometerse con la
utilización del material estrictamente mínimo y 
necesario.

*** LE
JACKIE PALL - THEATER GROUP***  les invita a  compartir la materialización  de Chez Jackie Pall – Lugar(es) de
Vida(s) y de Cultura(s)
Con el
deseo de  desarrollar a la escala de un
lugar preciso todas nuestras ambiciones artísticas y humanas, nos consagramos a
la rehabilitación de un baldío desde hace varios años, en una política
urbanística ambiciosa para  implementar actividades culturales territoriales
innovadoras, desde el punto de vista artístico,
urbanístico, logístico  y económico.
Hoy, Oscar Castro  nos invita a vivir la experiencia de Chez Jackie Pall – Lugar(es)
de Vida(s) y de Cultura(s)   en  esta
casa en colaboración con el Teatro Aleph Chile que fundó  en  el
2013 en Santiago, con el objectivo de intercambar conocimientos y de manera reciproca enriquecer nuestra experiencias.
Un equipo compuesto de 11 interventores (artistas, artesanos,
técnicos) franceses emprende el viaje para descubrir los 1000 m2  de terreno atribuidos,  entre los cuales 350 m2  de un caserón de dos niveles.




***
El  TEATRO ALEPH CHILE (TAC)  reúne alrededor
de Oscar, fundador del Teatro Aleph,  y Gabriela Olguin, actriz
del Teatro Aleph, una decena de jóvenes
actores de los barrios populares  de la Región metropolitana de Santiago,
alrededor de un proyecto de teatro comunitario, popular, humanista y
festivo. Presenta regularmente espectáculos de Oscar Castro en Santiago y
organiza talleres  de teatro
con los vecinos  de los barrios populares  de la región metropolitana de Santiago, en
el marco del Festival Mil Veces Metropolitano, creado y organizado por
el TAC, que tiene lugar cada año en la región de Santiago desde el 2012.

JPTP propone una plataforma de
financiación participativa  en la que
el contribuidor/espectador propone y/o participa a los avances*** de la
apertura del lugar cuyos propósitos son
los siguientes:



-> Colaboración JPTG/ Teatro Aleph Chile (TAC): últimas obras de
rehabilitación  (interior/exterior) que permitan recibirlos dos
equipos  en su lugar de vida cotidiana. Creaciones artísticas
pluridisciplinarias mezclando artistas franceses y chilenos, aficionados y
profesionales,  a través particularmente de la recreación  del Kabaret de la Ultima suerte, obra escrita por Oscar Castro en 1986.



-> Implantación
territorial en el barrio: encuentro con las asociaciones locales
(artísticas, artesanales, sociales) y los coparticipes  de vida cotidiana (comercios de proximidad,
hortelanos).



->Trabajo de
investigación  sobre la historia del
lugar, del barrio, de la ciudad, del país. Archivo cotidiano  de la evolución de la casa  mediante escritos, fotos, videos. (en esta foto, conversación Skype con el TAC, que nos presenta a los antiguos propietarios de la casa)



-> Viaje a
través de Chile ( Valparaiso, desierto de Atacama) al encuentro de artistas,
artesanos y poblaciones locales, restituyendo nuestro recorrido en un mapa interactivo via internet.





-> Creación de los primeros
acontecimientos efímeros, pluridisciplinarios, abiertos, lúdicos, festivos e
intergeneracionales destinados a establecer las fundaciones del
futuro lugar.

CONCRETAMENTE EL DINERO SERVIRA A:

^^^ La creatividad deberá ser el eje motor de la cantera.
Privilegiar la recuperación de material para adoptar maneras inteligentes y
económicas de renovación. Por ejemplo utilización de materiales tales que la
paja, la tierra o la caña, que parecen ser a la vez ecológicos y económicos,
pero también  la creación de nuestra
propia pintura a base de caseína y de cal, o la fabricación de adobes. Sin embargo
será necesario comprar elementos de base (ferretería, herramientas... )
^^^ Juntos, organizaremos rápidamente los espacios
interiores y exteriores tendrán que ser rápidamente organizados para acoger a
los primeros visitantes y crear un lugar propicio al intercambio y al
compartir. Hemos pensado por ejemplo en la construcción de un bar  efímero de madera, la instalación de baños
suplementarios, la compra y/o 
recuperación y renovación de camas y colchas para alojarse en  la casa





-> Trabajo de terreno y archivo/ Encuentro con
profesionales y aficionados locales, regionales, nacionales:


^^^  Arriendo de mini bus Location d'un mini-bus
^^^  Gastos de
gasolina Frais d’essence
^^^  Gastos de
alojamiento fuera de Santiago Frais d’hébergements hors Santiago 






-> Creación de
eventos en el lugar  invertido:
^^^ Compra/arriendo o reparación de material técnico (iluminaciones, alto-parlantes,
equipos técnicos…)
^^^ Intervenciones/ difusiones urbanas (collages en la calle de
formato  gigante, video proyección
exterior…)
^^^Acogida del público. (Comida rápida  y bebidas…)

Hasta
hoy, el Jackie Pall - Theater Group  se ha nutrido de experiencias
concretas, de bases de experimentación enriquecedoras que le permiten proponer
nuevas, más densas a la escala del lugar cuyo funcionamiento depende de su
propia identidad:



*** En septiembre de
2015, el JPTG se instala en el l’A.E.R.I.  (Taller-experiencia-re
dinamización-inserción), un lugar asociativo que desde 25 anos propone prácticas
en arte-terapia a los marginados de nuestra sociedad. Nacido de la ocupación de
este lugar, Pendant que les champs brûlent  (Mientras queman los campos)  propone a través de 4 noches:


* una serie de instalaciones creadas  según los archivos de un año de reflexiones
cotidianas
* un lugar donde artistas,
artesanos, invitados se agitan en un escenario alrededor de una historia
colectiva que van inventando en relación estrecha con los visitantes.
* Una comida ofrecida  para todos.
* Una fiesta en la que el
espacio se convierte en un lugar de intercambios y de encuentros.




*** Entre
diciembre de 2014 y junio de 2015, siete representaciones del EL Kabaret de la última suerte, en el teatro Aleph de Ivry
sur Seine. Una experiencia teatral
mezclando actores profesionales, aficionados, amigos y músicos, invitando cada
noche a gente de horizontes diferentes , juntando el escenario y el público en
una misma energía creadora y festiva.




***
 En 2013-2014, Caudry Factory reúne a un equipo de 10 artistas
dedicados a trabajar juntos alrededor de la industria del encaje, emblemática
de la ciudad de Caudry, temática común. Las “tomadas de vida” cosechadas a lo
largo de muchos meses acabaron por movilizar el equipo en el corazón de la
ciudad con diversas acciones artísticas tales como collages en la calle, rodaje
de largo metraje, proyección de cine drive, un ballet armonizado por la
orquesta local; una  instalación,  un cuarto a doble sentido...



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


***
De 2012 a 2016, el TAC participa a
las 4 primeras ediciones del  festival Mil
veces metropolitano con “La casa acepta el fracaso”, “ el 11 de
septiembre de Salvador Allende” y “El exiliado Mateluna” (tres
obras de Oscar Castro)y ‘el rodaje de l’E.M” con siete grupos
de jóvenes de siete barrios desfavorecidos de la región metropolitana de
Santiago.


***Enero de 2013,  creación
oficial del TAC  y representaciones del ” Exiliado Mateluna” y “Sube, sube la espumita” en gira por  Santiago, Talca y Rancagua.


*** Junio, julio de 2013 – presentación de la obra “OTNI (Objeto teatral no identificado” de
Oscar Castro, en varios lugares de Santiago.

-> Si el JPTP
solicita una financiación participativa via Indiegogo, es siempre con la idea
de que la reunión de individualidades y
medios  alrededor de un objetivo común y compartido es una
fuerza necesaria para cumplir con  sus
deseos. Estamos convencidos de que este deseo no es solamente el del JPTG, sino
que puede ser un sueño común y
compartido, abriendo el camino  a
nuevas maneras de crear, intercambiar,
mirar, escuchar y concebir la ciudad, su paisaje, sus habitantes. Por eso,
acudimos a su participación para  aceptar
el desafío que  va más allá de la ambición individual  de un grupo, para construir las bases de
un proyecto abierto, todavía lleno de cuestionamientos y desconocido, pero real y al alcance de mano.

-> Así como, consideramos fundamental la ocupación y la apertura del lugar, que sea abierto y accesibles a todos, cualquier sean los medios financieros, las contrapartes ofrecidas a los donadores/ participantes de Chez Jackie Pall - Lugar de Vida(s) y de Cultura(s) serán idénticas para todos  que la donación sea  de1 $ à 1000 $.

->  Optamos por recoger la suma en $$$ con el fin de que los contribuidores de ambos países (Francia/ Chile) puedan participar sin ninguna dificultad de pago. Cada participante puede contribuir en la divisa de su país y no tiene necesidad de abrir una cuenta Paypal.




Así, nos comprometimos en  proponer 
cada semana una reseña de los avances del proyecto en el sitio, con
propuestas artísticas personalizadas (bajo la forma de videos, fotos, grabaciones
sonoras) vía  enlaces internet privados
que solo los contribuidores puedan consultar.

Providing a quality program for students who deserve a great experience and access to digital tools and resources is our greatest barrier. Essential supplies such as flash drives, proprietary software and applications, auxiliary cables and headphones. Other expenses include travel and accommodation for instructors to teach these young, brilliant minds.
We have had great success with in-kind donations such as laptops and other sound recording equipment. We appreciate all help and consideration.
   Infinite Ways You Can Help






We are always willing to receive in-kind donations. This includes used computers, laptops, speakers, microphones or any other equipment used for music or video production. We are always reconfiguring, fixing, and repurposing used parts. Please email us at digitalcreativeworkshop@gmail.com to discuss shipping directly.

<b><br/></b>
<p>Haiti. Beautiful blue seas with breathtaking mountainous landscapes- all make it a charming surprise for tourists. But Haiti is arguably more recognized internationally for its natural disasters or acute poverty. How can a community with an abundance of natural resources remain the poorest in the western hemisphere? Why is the environment so degraded?</p>
<p><b>Preserving Haiti from Below: The Exhibit </b>will initiate change by educating youth on marine biodiversity and its connection to the broader environment.  It will share content that indicates how human behavior towards the environment actually stagnates job creation.

<p><b>Why does The Exhibit need to be produced?</b></p>
<p>In December 2015, Haiti was referred to in Paris (COP21) as one of 3 countries on the brink of environmental collapse. Less than 2% of forests remain; only 15% of coral reefs along the coastline are healthy, due to erosion, overfishing, and waste pollution. In order to save whatever natural resources remain, we must start by educating the community, and especially the youth, on the impacts of human behavior.</p>
<p>Children are the future. In every nation, rich or poor, their perspectives and behaviors ultimately determine the future direction of a country. Media. Culture. Economy. The key to progress is to influence their perceptions and future actions.</p>

<p>In Haiti, environmental issues are not taught in traditional schools. As a result, adults have very little understanding of the ecosystems and show little respect for animals and plants. Culturally, Haitians also tend to have a disconnect with natural elements and a certain fear of the ocean.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>Through The Exhibit, we want to explain the relationship between trees cut on the hilltops and the destruction of the corals, the increase in floods and drought, the disappearance of jobs, and the loss of prospects for future happiness. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>What will The Exhibit entail?</b></p>
<p>Events catch attention, but experiences are remembered. </p>

Risk and Challenges
While we are confident this exhibit will have a great impact on those who visit, producing a month-long activity can be very expensive. We have put together a flexible budget that will allow us to modify the features in the event our campaign isn’t fully funded. We are dedicated and qualified to make this content accessible to children across all sectors of society. We will proactively provide updates on production timelines and scheduling; and you’ll know when to mark your calendars for the opening.

<p><b>Many people view dinosaurs as the classic proof of evolution and disproof of creation.</b><br/></p>
<p>Evolutionists
have certainly understood the value of using dinosaurs as a “propaganda tool.”
They have effectively employed this tool in textbooks, science videos, and even
popular movies. Students are not just taught about the anatomy and living
habits of dinosaurs; from an early age they are taught dinosaurs lived millions
of years ago. Even when our fascination for dinosaurs begins to fade, this
“indoctrination” remains - dinosaurs evolved, Genesis is wrong.  But is it?  Watch this interview with Timothy Clarey, PhD author of 'Dinosaurs:  Marvels of God's Design'.</p>

<p>In 2005 Dr. Mary Schweitzer published her discovery of soft-tissue found in a T-Rex femur. Her claims were controversial and sensational. Animal tissue (including cells and proteins) is very fragile.  How could dinosaur tissue survive millions of years? During an interview on <i>60 Minutes, </i>Dr. Schweitzer stated that she was concerned about publishing her results about the soft recognizable tissue.  As she expected, her research received intense criticism from her evolutionary colleagues.  However, Dr. Schweitzer continued to publish, despite the controversy.   </p>
<p>The funny thing is so few people have even heard of the soft tissue controversy.  Watch this video to learn more about that.</p>

<p>CRS
and Evidence Press, Inc. (EPI) have teamed up to create a documentary running about 90-minutes in length.  This documentary will discuss Dr. Schweitzer's discoveries and the CRS triceratops horn analysis.  It will also address many questions such as, how and why the dinosaurs
were buried so suddenly, issues about how fossils are dated, and common objections to the
Creation / Flood model.  </p>

<h3>What Is Needed</h3>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>When Dr, Schweitzer found
soft and pliable tissue still remaining inside dinosaur fossils she immediately
understood the significance.  Soft tissue is not supposed to exist in fossils found in rock layers dated to be 68 million years old!  Tissue simply should
not last more than a few thousand years.  Yet, even more incredible, in a later publication Schweitzer revealed the discovery of intact bone cells called osteocytes and also the presence of proteins!  </p>
<p>Dr. Schweitzer has proposed
several explanations for the survival of dinosaur tissue. 
<i>Echoes of the Jurassic  </i>will discuss these and challenge her explanations with scientific evidence.  </p>
<p>Much is at stake.  If dinosaur fossils are only a few
thousand years old, then the assumptions and methods used to date
these fossils are flawed. This would draw into question the entire ‘millions of
years’ evolutionary time-frame.  This <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">would be nothing less than revolutionary!  It
would rock the very foundation of the evolution establishment. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The evidence from the </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Triceratops </i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">horn adds even more evidence in favor of it being real dinosaur soft tissue.  </span></p>
<p>People love a good story involving science.  They
especially love empirical science (that which is testable and repeatable).  With the horn research, soft tissues in dinosaurs are being discovered from multiple fossils locations.  The <i><i>Echoes of the Jurassic </i> </i>documentary will provide
corroborating evidence demonstrating that dinosaurs in rock layers dated to 65-million or more years are really only thousands of
years old.  </p>
<p>Your gifts will fund this project so we can demonstrate to the world the
real age of dinosaurs.  <br/></p>

Many people view dinosaurs as the classic proof of evolution and disproof of creation.
Evolutionists
have certainly understood the value of using dinosaurs as a “propaganda tool.”
They have effectively employed this tool in textbooks, science videos, and even
popular movies. Students are not just taught about the anatomy and living
habits of dinosaurs; from an early age they are taught dinosaurs lived millions
of years ago. Even when our fascination for dinosaurs begins to fade, this
“indoctrination” remains - dinosaurs evolved, Genesis is wrong.  But is it?  Watch this interview with Timothy Clarey, PhD author of 'Dinosaurs:  Marvels of God's Design'.
However, what if dinosaurs did not actually live 85 million years ago?  What if they did not become extinct almost 65 million years ago? What if humans and dinosaurs actually lived at the same time in earth’s history? What if the answer to these questions means that dinosaurs lived just a few thousand years ago?  Rather than being evolution’s “classic proof,” dinosaurs would be a major contradiction. 

New evidence has been discovered that challenges what we know about dinosaurs.  
In 2005 Dr. Mary Schweitzer published her discovery of soft-tissue found in a T-Rex femur. Her claims were controversial and sensational. Animal tissue (including cells and proteins) is very fragile.  How could dinosaur tissue survive millions of years? During an interview on 60 Minutes, Dr. Schweitzer stated that she was concerned about publishing her results about the soft recognizable tissue.  As she expected, her research received intense criticism from her evolutionary colleagues.  However, Dr. Schweitzer continued to publish, despite the controversy.   
The funny thing is so few people have even heard of the soft tissue controversy.  Watch this video to learn more about that.
You can download the article that Jim gives to the students he interviews HERE.
The Creation Research Society
(CRS) commissioned a team to look for their own dinosaur specimens in hopes of
finding soft-tissue.  On May 12, 2012 a
horn from a Triceratops was excavated
from the Hell Creek Formation (in Montana).  The
researchers found that the horn also contained soft, pliable
tissue. In 2013, Mark Armitage and Kevin
Anderson published these findings in the
journal Acta Histochemica, as well as the
cover of American Laboratory, at the 2014
Microscopy & Microanalysis International Conference, and in the Creation Research Society Quarterly  (Spring, 2015 issue).  (See http://tinyurl.com/nphm2c4 for more information about the CRS project.)
The following short video begins to tell the story surrounding dinosaur soft tissue.  


CRS
and Evidence Press, Inc. (EPI) have teamed up to create a documentary running about 90-minutes in length.  This documentary will discuss Dr. Schweitzer's discoveries and the CRS triceratops horn analysis.  It will also address many questions such as, how and why the dinosaurs
were buried so suddenly, issues about how fossils are dated, and common objections to the
Creation / Flood model.  

What Is Needed

There is still much work to be done such as editing the dozens of hours
of film from multiple camera angles and mix it with graphics, music,
titles, and narration. Success of raising $25,000 will enable us to
develop a professional quality video production.
Throughout the documentary there will be
visuals to help tell
the story.   For example watch the clip below.
The graphics in the above video are produced in a 3D graphical program.  We are all accustomed to watching amazing graphics and we need to include them in this documentary.  However, motion graphics are expensive and time consuming to produce.  Your support will help us develop high quality graphics for Echoes of the Jurassic.Another significant cost will be for the licensing of 60 Minutes and BBC2
footage so the story of Dr. Schweitzer and her discoveries can be quickly and
accurately told.   The BBC2 and 60 Minutes footage is very powerful and we would
like to include a few minutes of it.  However, the licensing costs are substantial.  Once
we meet our initial goal, additional money would be used to purchase such footage.  

What You Get
Your
donations will enable completion of this documentary
as a professional quality production.  There are several levels to choose from with a variety of amazing perks.  We encourage you to consider giving at more than one level and receive more than one perk.  You get more and so does the project. 

The Impact

When Dr, Schweitzer found
soft and pliable tissue still remaining inside dinosaur fossils she immediately
understood the significance.  Soft tissue is not supposed to exist in fossils found in rock layers dated to be 68 million years old!  Tissue simply should
not last more than a few thousand years.  Yet, even more incredible, in a later publication Schweitzer revealed the discovery of intact bone cells called osteocytes and also the presence of proteins!  
Dr. Schweitzer has proposed
several explanations for the survival of dinosaur tissue. 
Echoes of the Jurassic  will discuss these and challenge her explanations with scientific evidence.  
Much is at stake.  If dinosaur fossils are only a few
thousand years old, then the assumptions and methods used to date
these fossils are flawed. This would draw into question the entire ‘millions of
years’ evolutionary time-frame.  This would be nothing less than revolutionary!  It
would rock the very foundation of the evolution establishment. The evidence from the Triceratops horn adds even more evidence in favor of it being real dinosaur soft tissue.  
People love a good story involving science.  They
especially love empirical science (that which is testable and repeatable).  With the horn research, soft tissues in dinosaurs are being discovered from multiple fossils locations.  The Echoes of the Jurassic  documentary will provide
corroborating evidence demonstrating that dinosaurs in rock layers dated to 65-million or more years are really only thousands of
years old.  
Your gifts will fund this project so we can demonstrate to the world the
real age of dinosaurs.

<p>Q.  When will I receive Attocube?<br/>
        A.   We want you to receive Attocube in time for Christmas so please expect to receive it by December 10, 2015.</p>
<p>Q.  What is Attocube made of?<br/>
        A.  Attocube is made of all natural woods with non-toxic coloring to ensure safety for children.</p>
<p>Q.  Why did you choose to make Attocube with wooden materials?<br/>
        A.   We wanted to make children's toy safe.  We understand wood is better suited for children compared to artificial materials often used in children's toys because it doesn't contain chemicals and lead that can negatively affect children's health.</p>
<p>Q.  What other development skills does Attocube help children develop?<br/>
        A.  Unlike online toys, Attocube allows children to touch and feel physical blocks which helps children develop these important sensory, dexterity, spatial, and motor skills along with creativity, critical thinking, concentration, and teamwork. </p>
<p>Q. Why don't you offer FREE SHIPPING?  Do you ship anywhere in the world? <br/>
        A. In order to offer Attocube with the lowest price possible, we could not include the Free Shipping option. However, we do ship to almost every country, with the lowest rate possible. We will provide the full listing as soon as possible. If you want to know if your country is available for shipping, please contact us. We will be happy to inform you :)</p>
<p>Q. How can i choose color I want?<br/>
        A. After the Indiegogo campaign closes, we will contact each supporter for their choice of color and for customization options (ex. school name, organization etc.) </p>

As parents we worry that our children spend too much time playing with smartphones and tablets that aren't helping them develop important sensory and motor skills.




Attocube was created to help train the minds of young children, boosting creativity, problem solving, concentration and team work.

               “Education is not the learning of facts,                                        but the training of the mind to think”

AttoCube integrates timeless classic wooden blocks with technology to create a smart toy that provides fun & entertaining educational games for children.


Attocube consists of cubes with all surfaces featuring different geometric patterns. Using patterns, any images such as letters and numbers can be created.



Attocube comes with Stand, Reflector Mirror Attachment, 9 wooden blocks, and 100 image cards.

        A.   We wanted to make children's toy safe.  We understand wood is better suited for children compared to artificial materials often used in children's toys because it doesn't contain chemicals and lead that can negatively affect children's health.
Q.  What other development skills does Attocube help children develop?
        A.  Unlike online toys, Attocube allows children to touch and feel physical blocks which helps children develop these important sensory, dexterity, spatial, and motor skills along with creativity, critical thinking, concentration, and teamwork. 
Q. Why don't you offer FREE SHIPPING?  Do you ship anywhere in the world? 
        A. In order to offer Attocube with the lowest price possible, we could not include the Free Shipping option. However, we do ship to almost every country, with the lowest rate possible. We will provide the full listing as soon as possible. If you want to know if your country is available for shipping, please contact us. We will be happy to inform you :)
Q. How can i choose color I want?
        A. After the Indiegogo campaign closes, we will contact each supporter for their choice of color and for customization options (ex. school name, organization etc.)

<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><br/></span></h3><h3><span><span>What is ignis and why are we doing it</span></span></h3><div><br/></div><div>The idea behind ignis is simple - to provide a free tool to facilitate education, especially (but not exclusively) to kids of lower socioeconomic status while allowing the parents to be more involved in the process. </div><div><br/></div><p>In Ecuador and many other places, the current system is based on a diary notebook in which students write down which assignments they have. If the school wants to send a message to all the students and parents, they do so by printing it and giving a paper to each student to take home. All this implies costs for the students directly or indirectly, as well as for the environment. On top of this, many times those messages never get to the parents, and there is a notable lack of communication between parents and the school, which negatively affects the quality of the kids education.</p><p>In the schools with lack of resources, the kids write down their assignments in the same notebook they use for class. This can create confusion as parents can't identify the kid's assignments and can't review them. While most of the kids in these schools don't have cellphones, their parents do. We have talked to the parents in several of these schools and they all are very excited about the idea!</p><p>Keeping this in mind, we thought about providing a free learning tool that could complement, and eventually replace, the use of a diary/notebook to write down the assignments and the printed notifications. Specifically, ignis will work as follows:</p><ul>
<li><p>Teachers will write down the assignments and the due date</p></li>
<li><p>Teachers will write down quizzes and the date they will be taken</p></li>
<li><p>Assignments and quizzes will show up for students</p></li>
<li><p>They will be able to sort them by date received and their due date</p></li>
<li><p>The school and teachers will be able to send announcements to either or both students and parents</p></li>
<li><p>The students and parents will be able to send messages back to the teachers and/or school.</p></li>
</ul><p>The idea is to keep the tool as simple and as user friendly as possible. Our aim is to avoid that anyone has trouble using the platform while still providing an useful tool.</p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453645525/zoopnlxakkj7jji0oshl.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><br/><p>To start with, ignis will have five tabs: Homework, Quizzes, Announcements, Messages and Trophies. A description of each follows:</p><ul>
<li><p>HOMEWORK: Shows the homework received classified by received date and due date. The student can select if it is ordered by most recent received date, or by closest due date.</p></li>
<li><p>QUIZZES: Shows the quizzes classified by received date and due date. The student can select if it is ordered by most recent received date, or by closest due date.</p></li>
<li><p>ANNOUNCEMENTS: This will be used for general announcements the school makes for students and their tutors. Special events, for example. </p></li>
<li><p>MESSAGES: Private interaction between teachers and students and/or tutors. Mainly designed to have an easy way of communication between teachers and tutors.</p></li>
<li><p>TROPHIES: There will be a set of achievements that a student can earn, for example a student that has checked all the homework during a month will complete that achievement and receive a symbolic trophy for it. In this tab will be shown the trophies that each student has, and will be possible to see among all the students of the school. </p></li>
</ul><br/><p>With your help we will be able to provide for free an easier, faster, more reliable and greener alternative to the current system used by students and their parents to keep track of assignments, while also providing teachers and schools to send communications directly to the students and/or parents.</p><p>We are convinced that ignis will be a useful tool for many students, parents, teachers and schools increasing the quality of their education. We would like to invite you to be part of this wonderful cause!</p><p>As time goes by, we will strive to keep improving the platform in order to offer a better, friendlier and more efficient tool.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>What we need to make this possible</h3><br/><p>Remember that you can help not only by donating!

If the school wants to send a message to all the students and parents, they do so by printing it and giving a paper to each student to take home. All this implies costs for the students directly or indirectly, as well as for the environment. On top of this, many times those messages never get to the parents, and there is a notable lack of communication between parents and the school, which negatively affects the quality of the kids education.In the schools with lack of resources, the kids write down their assignments in the same notebook they use for class. This can create confusion as parents can't identify the kid's assignments and can't review them. While most of the kids in these schools don't have cellphones, their parents do. We have talked to the parents in several of these schools and they all are very excited about the idea!Keeping this in mind, we thought about providing a free learning tool that could complement, and eventually replace, the use of a diary/notebook to write down the assignments and the printed notifications. Specifically, ignis will work as follows:
Teachers will write down the assignments and the due date
Teachers will write down quizzes and the date they will be taken
Assignments and quizzes will show up for students
They will be able to sort them by date received and their due date
The school and teachers will be able to send announcements to either or both students and parents
The students and parents will be able to send messages back to the teachers and/or school.
The idea is to keep the tool as simple and as user friendly as possible. Our aim is to avoid that anyone has trouble using the platform while still providing an useful tool.To start with, ignis will have five tabs: Homework, Quizzes, Announcements, Messages and Trophies. A description of each follows:
HOMEWORK: Shows the homework received classified by received date and due date. The student can select if it is ordered by most recent received date, or by closest due date.
QUIZZES: Shows the quizzes classified by received date and due date. The student can select if it is ordered by most recent received date, or by closest due date.
ANNOUNCEMENTS: This will be used for general announcements the school makes for students and their tutors. Special events, for example. 
MESSAGES: Private interaction between teachers and students and/or tutors. Mainly designed to have an easy way of communication between teachers and tutors.
TROPHIES: There will be a set of achievements that a student can earn, for example a student that has checked all the homework during a month will complete that achievement and receive a symbolic trophy for it. In this tab will be shown the trophies that each student has, and will be possible to see among all the students of the school. 
With your help we will be able to provide for free an easier, faster, more reliable and greener alternative to the current system used by students and their parents to keep track of assignments, while also providing teachers and schools to send communications directly to the students and/or parents.We are convinced that ignis will be a useful tool for many students, parents, teachers and schools increasing the quality of their education. We would like to invite you to be part of this wonderful cause!As time goes by, we will strive to keep improving the platform in order to offer a better, friendlier and more efficient tool.What we need to make this possibleRemember that you can help not only by donating! Sharing this with other folks is very valuable and appreciated as well!After researching and analyzing what is needed to bring this project to life, we have arrived to the conclusion that we need $9800, which will be spent as follows:
$5300 will be needed for platform development

Website in which the students and teachers register
App for both Iphone and Android

$2500 for increasing the awareness about the platform

Targeted Facebook ads
Hire representatives to visit schools
Printed materials

$1200 for establishing and maintaining the servers
$800  for covering Indiegogo’s and other fees
With this we should be able to provide ignis to many students in Ecuador, and hopefully internationally as well. If we don’t receive the totality of the funds, we will invest the amount received in building the platform, and try to raise the rest of the necessary funds in another way. We won't give up!Any funds that go over the requested amount will be used to bring ignis to more people that will benefit from it!What will you get backAlthough we are sure you are contributing to help, and not to receive, we offer you the following perks as our way to thank you for your contribution:$10 Everything counts!You will receive a sincere thank you email for this great contribution!$20 I am in!  You will be mentioned in the website as a contributor and also a thank you email!$35 Yay education!Your name will be featured in the app randomly among the other donors with a small  message you would like to give to the kids!.

<p>Kristen, Compton and Kevin are three individuals from very different backgrounds that have come together to provide a physical space for collaborative projects of all different styles. Over the past year, we have worked tirelessly to build our community and we have hit a point where the need for our services and use of our space has outgrown the capabilities of our current location.

</div></div>","Who are we?:




Kristen, Compton and Kevin are three individuals from very different backgrounds that have come together to provide a physical space for collaborative projects of all different styles. Over the past year, we have worked tirelessly to build our community and we have hit a point where the need for our services and use of our space has outgrown the capabilities of our current location. We feel strongly about the need for a truly INCLUSIVE venue in New York City as we have watched many of the outlets for new art and music disappear or become inaccessible over the past decade.
What have we done so far?:
Backdrop Brooklyn has become a safe, comfortable space for hundreds of artists and musicians of all genres and disciplines to come to create and collaborate on projects of all types. 
Backdrop has become an all inclusive creative hub for the following services:



Rehearsal space for bands


Recording for music projects


Photo and video shoots and production


Visual art shows


Film screenings


Workshops and seminars


Weekly jam sessions


Links to examples of our work can be found on:
YouTube
Soundcloud

Moving forward - what does the future hold?:
We currently are running all of these events and services out of just ONE ROOM!
Our new space will allow for a separate sound proof recording studio, soundproof rehearsal studio and separate event and production space. This will allow us to run all of these services simultaneously to meet the growing demand as our community continues to expand. 
We need your help to be able to continue to provide accessible creative services and outlets to all of the super talented people here in New York City.

Here's more on what Street Soccer Seattle brings to our community.

The Fundraiser
Sounders FC and SIF are thinking BIG. Engaging in an authentic way and making a lasting impact is of the utmost importance, which to us means not only on-the-ground inspiration, but long-term capacity building to facilitate change.
Our fundraising goal is $40,000, to be split between Street Soccer Mexico and Street Soccer Seattle. These grants will be used to fund the following projects:

Street Soccer Mexico


Having already established eight developmental leagues serving homeless populations in Mexico City, Street Soccer Mexico is a leader among 'Street Soccer' organizations worldwide. This grant would allow expansion into an already identified marginalized community to implement a 12-month intervention for youth in Mexico City.
Interventions are need-based, but can include access to social housing programs and health services, conflict resolution, school retention, skills training for improved job prospects, or treatment for drug addictions.

Street Soccer Seattle


 Street Soccer Seattle's biggest needs are twofold: 1) a physical space for day-to-day operations to establish consistency for the youth that they serve and 2) resources to increase capacity and expand programming to reach more youth and better address their needs.
In addition to providing the stability of a permanent space, this grant would provide resources for Street Soccer to hire a Program Manager, an individual dedicated to the expansion of programs  based on shared-knowledge and lessons learned from Street Soccer Mexico.


A portion of the proceeds will subsidize Seattle Sounders FC and Seattle International Foundations travel expenses to Mexico City to engage Street Soccer Mexico and the homeless youth that they serve. Watch this video to see how Street Soccer Mexico is positively affecting lives in Mexico City.

<p>Guess what! It’s that time again. We’ve almost reached the end of the test results from the first fundraiser, 5 Oils 10 Companies, so now it’s time to get started on the second one. </p>
<br/><h3>Why do I want to start a second fundraising campaign?</h3>
<p>I am still overwhelmed by your positive comments as well as your funding support from the first fundraiser. Our goal was $10,000 to test 5 oils from 10 companies. All of you surpassed the goal with $12,340 donated and we were able to test 5 oils from 18 companies.</p>
<p>It could not have happened without your amazing support! </p>
<br/><h4>What is at the heart of this campaign?</h4>
<p></p>
<p><span>We all love essential oils. We love using them, smelling them, and studying them. We want the best we can buy at an affordable price. All of us, company and consumer alike, want to know that the essential oils we depend on meet the basic expectation of purity.</span></p>
<p>There is a balance of trust throughout the essential oil supply chain. Consumers trust their companies. Companies trust their suppliers.  Suppliers trust their distillers. When tests of all the oils from a company show there are no adulterations, it keeps the trust throughout the chain. But when an adulteration is found, either intentional or unintentional, the trust is broken. That is when the dialogue can begin. In the first round of testing, we invited companies to be part of an open and frank dialogue with the consumers. We asked: How did it happen? Where is the break in the chain of trust? Can I trust this company? What will the company do now to fix it? Those discussions were informative, respectful, and did much to bring company and consumer together.</p>Third party testing serves as a necessary part of the system of checks and balances. It benefits consumers, it benefits the reputable companies, and it benefits the honest suppliers. Independent testing run by consumers helps keep the system of checks and balances running smoothly. However, while we need GC tests to help us see the purity of the oils, these tests can be expensive for any one individual to pay for. That is why we need this fundraiser.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p> </p>
<h4>What did we learn from the first round of essential oil testing?</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>There are some companies who care a great deal about integrity. </p></li>
<li><p>Of the companies we tested, the problematic oils that were uncovered were adulterated by suppliers to the companies rather than the companies themselves. This was interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>All the Vetiver oils that were sourced from Sri Lanka were adulterated. None of the Vetiver oils from other countries were adulterated. That raises questions that should be pursued further. </p></li>
<li><p>All of us learned more about GC testing — how to read the test results and how to use those test results for ourselves.</p></li>
<li><p>There are some amazing and positive things that can be accomplished when the community works together.</p></li>
<li><p>The presentation of testing results is critical. We scraped by in the beginning with posting the first round of results on Facebook. But the sheer number of test results became too messy and hard to access. I set up the <a href=""http://www.essentialoilsawareness.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Essential Oils Awareness </a> website to alleviate the challenges of posting and storing documents on Facebook. There you can truly see the tremendous amount of information that was gathered by the first fundraiser, as well as what can be accomplished through this fundraiser. </p></li>
</ol>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458688498/bq3oxf0jb4cwnx11tjna.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div> <p></p>
<p></p>
<h2><span>What is the fundraising goal?</span></h2>
<p>The target goal of $20,000.00 (USD) will facilitate the testing of 5 oils from 30 different companies. How exciting is that?! The amount of information all of us can gather from that will be priceless. </p>Any amount can be donated whether it be $5, $50, $5,000 or the entire amount. Whatever you can give will be more than welcome. And take note, the more money sent in, the more oils I can test. <p></p>
<h4><span>Who can donate?</span></h4>Anyone! Essential oil customers, company owners, friends, family, foes, and random people who just like to donate to fundraisers. All money will be pooled together no matter who it came from and it will all be used together. </div><div>
<p></p>
<h3><span>How will the testing be run?</span></h3>
<p>When the fundraiser ends, the 30 companies with the most nominations will be tested.  5 oils from each company will be sent to a reputable essential oil chemist for GC/MS testing. All test results, good or bad, will be made public.</p>
<p>Let me say that again. <b>All test results, good or bad, will be made public.</b></p>
<p>If a test comes back showing an adulteration, the company in question will be notified privately and given three days to handle the issue themselves and then the test result along with the company’s response will be published for all to see on the <a href=""http://www.essentialoilsawareness.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Essential Oils Awareness</a> website. </p>
<br/><h4>What is the plan for choosing companies, essential oils, ordering, etc?</h4>
<p>Because it worked so beautifully the first time, the plan is to do things in the same way on this testing run:</p>
<p><b>1. Companies:</b> In the first fundraiser, 27 companies were nominated and because of your generous donations, I was able to test 18 of them. However, that leaves 9 companies that were nominated and not tested. Out of respect for the previous donors, those companies are automatically transferred to this fundraiser and their previous votes will be tallied with the final results.  </p>
<p>The companies already tested on the first fundraiser are not eligible for nomination in this fundraiser. They are as follows:</p>

<p> — As multi level marketing (MLM) companies are being tested by other 3rd party testing groups at this time, I will not be testing any on this testing run.  Those results can be found on the <a href=""http://www.essentialoilsawareness.com/test-results/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Essential Oils Awareness</a> website. (These companies are Young Living, doTERRA, Melaleuca, AMEO, GoDesana, ItWorks, Scentsy, Essante, Forever Young, Be Young, Youngevity, Nature's Sunshine, Neal's Yard Remedies, Simply Aroma. These are the ones I know of.)</p>
<p> — While you may, of course, nominate smaller companies, the best ones to nominate will be those who are selling more than 20 single oils, because it will be easier to compare the same oils from company to company.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458688627/xzjy6jp18n3mvxw4dss7.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 489.71px;height: 327px;""/></p>
<br/><p><b>2. Essential Oils:</b> I will buy specific oils from the companies — the same oils from each company — to be tested, which <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">allows us to compare results across companies</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">. These will be some of the top ones that are most often adulterated. The oils chosen will be ordered by botanical name, not common name, so there will not be any mix-ups. Just like on the first fundraiser, the orders will be sent directly to the chemists and will be opened by the chemists, not by myself. I want to keep the chain of custody completely intact. And as much as I would rather not, I will once again have to keep the list of oils tested anonymous as well. This keeps the companies from looking for orders containing those specific 5 oils. (I will not be testing the exact same ones as the first testing run.) </span></p>
<p><b>3. Purchasing:</b> The companies will not know who is buying the oils from them. The orders will be done so they will not have my name on the orders. When needed, they will be shipped to a person who does not appear to have any connection to myself and will be forwarded, UNOPENED, to the chemist. The chemist and the company will be the only ones who will touch the bottles in any way. I will obtain from the chemist a statement saying that the oil packages came to them unopened.</p>
<p>Once again, this is to keep things fair. It will give every company a fair chance and will make sure that what is in their actual stock is what is sent in to the chemist. It will also preserve the chain of custody and keep it above reproach.</p>
<p><b>4. Results:</b> As I have stated before, all test results will be public. Every single one of them. It won't matter if they are good or bad. They will be public. If a company has a bad test or two or even all five, I will notify them of the bad results and they will be given 3 business days to respond. Then the results will be made public. They can choose to announce it themselves and handle the publicity first. They can choose to give me a response to publish with the results. They can also choose to not respond at all. That will be up to them. Regardless of what they do, I will still make the test results public.</p>
<p><b>5. Agenda:</b> No private agendas are allowed in this testing venture. This means that no donor — company or consumer — can manipulate the process. The chemist will give his written conclusions of the test results and if there is anything unclear or if a report somehow slips through the cracks without the chemist's conclusions, I will make sure to check with the chemist first before posting.</p>
<br/><h3>Are there perks for donating?</h3>
<p>Yes! I want you involved in more ways than just financially. Just like with the first one, donations of certain amounts give you a specific number of companies you can nominate to be tested. Beginning with $25.00, there are seven levels of perks and with each level, you will be able to nominate essential oil companies to be tested.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Level 1: $25 — 1 nomination</p></li>
<li><p>Level 2: $50 — 2 nominations</p></li>
<li><p>Level 3: $100 — 5 nominations</p></li>
<li><p>Level 4: $200 — 10 nominations</p></li>
<li><p>Level 5: $300 — 15 nominations</p></li>
<li><p>Level 6: $400 — 20 nominations</p></li>
<li><p>Level 7: $500 — 30 nominations</p></li>
</ul>
<br/><p>When you have sent in your qualifying donation, you will receive an email within one week asking for your nominations. You may vote multiple times for one company or distribute votes among multiple companies. It is your choice. The more you donate, the more nominations you can make!</p>
<p> — Because of the nature of this testing and the need to keep it honest and aboveboard, company donations are not eligible for making nominations.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

</div></div>","Getting Started
Guess what! It’s that time again. We’ve almost reached the end of the test results from the first fundraiser, 5 Oils 10 Companies, so now it’s time to get started on the second one. 
Why do I want to start a second fundraising campaign?
I am still overwhelmed by your positive comments as well as your funding support from the first fundraiser. Our goal was $10,000 to test 5 oils from 10 companies. All of you surpassed the goal with $12,340 donated and we were able to test 5 oils from 18 companies.
It could not have happened without your amazing support! 
What is at the heart of this campaign?

We all love essential oils. We love using them, smelling them, and studying them. We want the best we can buy at an affordable price. All of us, company and consumer alike, want to know that the essential oils we depend on meet the basic expectation of purity.
There is a balance of trust throughout the essential oil supply chain. Consumers trust their companies. Companies trust their suppliers.  Suppliers trust their distillers. When tests of all the oils from a company show there are no adulterations, it keeps the trust throughout the chain. But when an adulteration is found, either intentional or unintentional, the trust is broken. That is when the dialogue can begin. In the first round of testing, we invited companies to be part of an open and frank dialogue with the consumers. We asked: How did it happen? Where is the break in the chain of trust? Can I trust this company? What will the company do now to fix it? Those discussions were informative, respectful, and did much to bring company and consumer together.Third party testing serves as a necessary part of the system of checks and balances. It benefits consumers, it benefits the reputable companies, and it benefits the honest suppliers. Independent testing run by consumers helps keep the system of checks and balances running smoothly. However, while we need GC tests to help us see the purity of the oils, these tests can be expensive for any one individual to pay for. That is why we need this fundraiser.
 
What did we learn from the first round of essential oil testing?

There are some companies who care a great deal about integrity. 
Of the companies we tested, the problematic oils that were uncovered were adulterated by suppliers to the companies rather than the companies themselves. This was interesting.
All the Vetiver oils that were sourced from Sri Lanka were adulterated. None of the Vetiver oils from other countries were adulterated. That raises questions that should be pursued further. 
All of us learned more about GC testing — how to read the test results and how to use those test results for ourselves.
There are some amazing and positive things that can be accomplished when the community works together.
The presentation of testing results is critical. We scraped by in the beginning with posting the first round of results on Facebook. But the sheer number of test results became too messy and hard to access. I set up the  Essential Oils Awareness  website to alleviate the challenges of posting and storing documents on Facebook. There you can truly see the tremendous amount of information that was gathered by the first fundraiser, as well as what can be accomplished through this fundraiser. 



 

What is the fundraising goal?
The target goal of $20,000.00 (USD) will facilitate the testing of 5 oils from 30 different companies. How exciting is that?! The amount of information all of us can gather from that will be priceless. Any amount can be donated whether it be $5, $50, $5,000 or the entire amount. Whatever you can give will be more than welcome. And take note, the more money sent in, the more oils I can test. 
Who can donate?Anyone! Essential oil customers, company owners, friends, family, foes, and random people who just like to donate to fundraisers. All money will be pooled together no matter who it came from and it will all be used together. 

How will the testing be run?
When the fundraiser ends, the 30 companies with the most nominations will be tested.  5 oils from each company will be sent to a reputable essential oil chemist for GC/MS testing. All test results, good or bad, will be made public.
Let me say that again. All test results, good or bad, will be made public.
If a test comes back showing an adulteration, the company in question will be notified privately and given three days to handle the issue themselves and then the test result along with the company’s response will be published for all to see on the Essential Oils Awareness website. 
What is the plan for choosing companies, essential oils, ordering, etc?
Because it worked so beautifully the first time, the plan is to do things in the same way on this testing run:
1. Companies: In the first fundraiser, 27 companies were nominated and because of your generous donations, I was able to test 18 of them. However, that leaves 9 companies that were nominated and not tested. Out of respect for the previous donors, those companies are automatically transferred to this fundraiser and their previous votes will be tallied with the final results.  
The companies already tested on the first fundraiser are not eligible for nomination in this fundraiser. They are as follows:


Apothecary Shoppe


Appalachian Valley


Aromatics International


Aura Cacia


Barefut


Eden Botanicals


Edens Garden


Essential Oil Exchange


Essential Wholesale


Gritman


Jade Bloom

Majestic Pure

Mountain Rose Herbs

Nature's Gift

Now Solutions


Organic Infusions


Oshadhi

The Essential Oil Company


 — As multi level marketing (MLM) companies are being tested by other 3rd party testing groups at this time, I will not be testing any on this testing run.  Those results can be found on the Essential Oils Awareness website. (These companies are Young Living, doTERRA, Melaleuca, AMEO, GoDesana, ItWorks, Scentsy, Essante, Forever Young, Be Young, Youngevity, Nature's Sunshine, Neal's Yard Remedies, Simply Aroma. These are the ones I know of.)
 — While you may, of course, nominate smaller companies, the best ones to nominate will be those who are selling more than 20 single oils, because it will be easier to compare the same oils from company to company.

2. Essential Oils: I will buy specific oils from the companies — the same oils from each company — to be tested, which allows us to compare results across companies. These will be some of the top ones that are most often adulterated. The oils chosen will be ordered by botanical name, not common name, so there will not be any mix-ups. Just like on the first fundraiser, the orders will be sent directly to the chemists and will be opened by the chemists, not by myself. I want to keep the chain of custody completely intact. And as much as I would rather not, I will once again have to keep the list of oils tested anonymous as well. This keeps the companies from looking for orders containing those specific 5 oils. (I will not be testing the exact same ones as the first testing run.) 
3. Purchasing: The companies will not know who is buying the oils from them. The orders will be done so they will not have my name on the orders. When needed, they will be shipped to a person who does not appear to have any connection to myself and will be forwarded, UNOPENED, to the chemist. The chemist and the company will be the only ones who will touch the bottles in any way. I will obtain from the chemist a statement saying that the oil packages came to them unopened.
Once again, this is to keep things fair. It will give every company a fair chance and will make sure that what is in their actual stock is what is sent in to the chemist. It will also preserve the chain of custody and keep it above reproach.
4. Results: As I have stated before, all test results will be public. Every single one of them. It won't matter if they are good or bad. They will be public. If a company has a bad test or two or even all five, I will notify them of the bad results and they will be given 3 business days to respond. Then the results will be made public. They can choose to announce it themselves and handle the publicity first. They can choose to give me a response to publish with the results. They can also choose to not respond at all. That will be up to them. Regardless of what they do, I will still make the test results public.
5. Agenda: No private agendas are allowed in this testing venture. This means that no donor — company or consumer — can manipulate the process. The chemist will give his written conclusions of the test results and if there is anything unclear or if a report somehow slips through the cracks without the chemist's conclusions, I will make sure to check with the chemist first before posting.
Are there perks for donating?
Yes! I want you involved in more ways than just financially. Just like with the first one, donations of certain amounts give you a specific number of companies you can nominate to be tested. Beginning with $25.00, there are seven levels of perks and with each level, you will be able to nominate essential oil companies to be tested.

Level 1: $25 — 1 nomination
Level 2: $50 — 2 nominations
Level 3: $100 — 5 nominations
Level 4: $200 — 10 nominations
Level 5: $300 — 15 nominations
Level 6: $400 — 20 nominations
Level 7: $500 — 30 nominations

When you have sent in your qualifying donation, you will receive an email within one week asking for your nominations. You may vote multiple times for one company or distribute votes among multiple companies. It is your choice. The more you donate, the more nominations you can make!
 — Because of the nature of this testing and the need to keep it honest and aboveboard, company donations are not eligible for making nominations.

The Impact
Through this independent testing, we will all be able to band together as consumers and companies to keep the chain of trust intact from distiller to consumer. We can begin a movement to find more ways to help the essential oil community. 
Things to take note of
This testing run is for companies you love or are interested in or have questioned. This is to help us all have a better understanding of the purity of their oils as well as the quality of the company.
There is no guarantee that the company you nominate will be selected. Nor is there any guarantee that your favorite company will pass all of the tests. What these tests will do is make sure you have more information to work with when it comes to the companies you choose from.
As the money to pay for the testing will be pooled together, there will be no private testing for any individual or company.

</div><p>Dear Folks, I hope you will read this in a very fine spirit.  A close friend of mine Ms. Jyoti Rajput is
facing difficulties in sailing through her difficult time. </p>
<p>From last four years she working as recruiter in Delhi, and
at present drawing a salary some of approx <b>US $ 360.00</b>, every month. This amount is
quite reasonably earning for those who are living alone/ single in India. She was
living very happily. </p>
<p>But since October 2014 her life has changed very much. Her
elder sister, with whom she is attached very much , had to leave her husband
house with her two children (Pratistha (16 years ), and Shreyansh (9, Years)) due
to extreme domestic violence. She just left her well off husband house to save
her own and their children life.  She was
suffering from last 16 years. </p>
<p>When elder sister came to her parents house nobody was ready
to help financially or by any other means. 
As they are fearing of that she would ask for her part in parental
property. </p>
<p>The eldest daughter was already studying in class 10<sup>th </sup>DPS
of her home town in 2014, her final exam was in March 2015. But she could not
appear as they feared to go their home town, due to his father. She again took
the admission in class 10<sup>th</sup> in DPS Aligarh.  DPS is an expensive school in India , but they
had left with no choice as no school was ready to take the admission in class
10<sup>th</sup> due to rule of CBSE(Central Board of Secondary Education,
Delhi, India). In India 10<sup>th</sup> is most basic education. </p>
<p>The fee of DPS Aligarh is something around US $ 1253.00/ per
year (Rs. 84,000, however I am not sure about this figure but it may not be
less than US $ 1050.00 (Rs. 70,000) for both the children, which need to paid
on quarterly basis. They have already paid three quarters of fee from their
saving and loan from their relatives, and the last quarter fee is due in
January 2016. </p>
<p>Jyoti elder sister is also fighting legal case against husband.
Fighting a legal court in India is tedious and timing consuming. Also it has its
own expense. Honestly I am not aware about that expense. </p>
<p>Since the case  is in
court her elder sister cannot work anywhere, as she would lose the compensation
from her husband. She is also fighting the case for the custody of her
children. </p>
<p>Another problem Jyoti has loan on her credit card of amount
US $ 552.00 (Approx INR 37, 000). For which she is liable to pay a quite a portion
of her salary. I am sharing the proof of loan , as a screen shot which she had
share with me recently when I asked for the money as a proof that she has no
money.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450006701/hqjqhlpkophcvc4y7z1t.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I understand that sharing of such
information is not appropriate. So I am only sharing the relevant part of screen
shot.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Now days Jyoti is working in two jobs to meet her and her

facing difficulties in sailing through her difficult time. 
From last four years she working as recruiter in Delhi, and
at present drawing a salary some of approx US $ 360.00, every month. This amount is
quite reasonably earning for those who are living alone/ single in India. She was
living very happily. 
But since October 2014 her life has changed very much. Her
elder sister, with whom she is attached very much , had to leave her husband
house with her two children (Pratistha (16 years ), and Shreyansh (9, Years)) due
to extreme domestic violence. She just left her well off husband house to save
her own and their children life.  She was
suffering from last 16 years. 
When elder sister came to her parents house nobody was ready
to help financially or by any other means. 
As they are fearing of that she would ask for her part in parental
property. 
The eldest daughter was already studying in class 10th DPS
of her home town in 2014, her final exam was in March 2015. But she could not
appear as they feared to go their home town, due to his father. She again took
the admission in class 10th in DPS Aligarh.  DPS is an expensive school in India , but they
had left with no choice as no school was ready to take the admission in class
10th due to rule of CBSE(Central Board of Secondary Education,
Delhi, India). In India 10th is most basic education. 
The fee of DPS Aligarh is something around US $ 1253.00/ per
year (Rs. 84,000, however I am not sure about this figure but it may not be
less than US $ 1050.00 (Rs. 70,000) for both the children, which need to paid
on quarterly basis. They have already paid three quarters of fee from their
saving and loan from their relatives, and the last quarter fee is due in
January 2016. 
Jyoti elder sister is also fighting legal case against husband.
Fighting a legal court in India is tedious and timing consuming. Also it has its
own expense. Honestly I am not aware about that expense. 
Since the case  is in
court her elder sister cannot work anywhere, as she would lose the compensation
from her husband. She is also fighting the case for the custody of her
children. 
Another problem Jyoti has loan on her credit card of amount
US $ 552.00 (Approx INR 37, 000). For which she is liable to pay a quite a portion
of her salary. I am sharing the proof of loan , as a screen shot which she had
share with me recently when I asked for the money as a proof that she has no
money.I understand that sharing of such
information is not appropriate. So I am only sharing the relevant part of screen
shot.

Now days Jyoti is working in two jobs to meet her and her
sister and her children requirement, but still her total earning is simply not enough.
As total early expenditure of four people with legal case and expensive DPS fee
should be  approx US $ 7,762.00 per year
,  Where as Jyoti is earning US $
5,300.00 per year,  after  doing two jobs
I can assure with personal experience that this family is
bunch of good people and they are fighter against whatever the circumstances is.

Through this I would request you to help this family whatever
way you may like. 
What this family need as help Since, I am not aware about what would be appropriate suitable amount
for this family. I am putting this figure as US $ 1,195.00 (Approx INR
78,000.00). The reason of giving this figure is as follows 
US $
552.00-  This amount would
help Jyoti to get rid of her Credit Card loan.
US $
313.00-  DPS Aligarh last
quarter fee for both of the children
US $ 330.00-
 to repay their old loan taken from
lose friends and relative . 
Any extra amount would be an additional help to this family.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are a handful of musicians, playing regular gigs in various bands in
Bucharest. All of us share a passion for music and teaching music to
children, including our own.  </p>
<p>All of us are big rock fans, and plan on mainy covering the range
of rock and roll, classic rock, alternative, reggae, funk, heavy
metal, indie and progressive rock, </p>
<p>Our project is an after school program, which would start with individual
lessons, and transition into group band rehearsals, in order to build and
develop upon the foundation of team work and band cohesion.  We want to
help the children to play, and play together as a band, as quickly as possible,
because that it what they want to do to begin with.  They gradually discover
the benefits of theory, and keep broadening their horizons. The next step
would be to arrange gigs at local venues (fortunately, smoking ban will be
enforced in all public places in Bucharest, effective March 2016!!!), where
young musicians will be exposed to real live audiences and authentic concert
settings.</p>
<p>An important element of the program is community outreach.  We have
been contributing to a center which helps low-income family children with after
school programs, which they otherwise cannot afford.   We would like to
offer the opportunity to get free classes to those who display musical or
academic talent in school, yet cannot afford instruments or classes.  </p>
<p>We believe that our children's lives should not be spent staring at
computer, TV or phone screens, and really want to offer an incentive to them,
through rock music, to get off their couches, rock hard, and truly enjoy it!
 One little rocker at a time, we could make changes to both the music
community, and lessen the numbers of the couch-potato-club members.</p>
<p><b><b>HOW WE PLAN ON ACCOMPLISHING IT</b></b></p><b>
</b><p>Through the means of this crowdfunding
event, we hope to collect enough money to be able to rent a space, soundproof
it (we plan on doing the labor ourselves, just need to coer the cost of
materials), acquire the necessary sound equipment, and a few spare musical
instruments, and cover the salaries of the trainers (on a part-time basis) for
a perio of six months, until we can become self-sustainable. </p>
<p><b><span>WHAT WE NEED AND WHERE IT GOES</span></b></p>
<p>We will need a location, as close to central as possible without breaking bank
on lease.  While many have already expressed interest in attending, if the
location is not within everyone's reach, given the city traffic in the
late-afternoon hours, interest will drop.  </p>
<p>The school should be in a single-family house, in order to avoid
complaints about noise from neighbors.  About three practice classrooms
should suffice.</p>
<p>The rooms will be soundproofed, including window seals and doors.  We
plan on doing the labor ourselves, for cost saving purposes, and will only need
to cover the cost of materials. </p>
<p>Equipment required (per room):</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>Guitar/bass amp combo
+ cables</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Drum kit</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Mixing board </p>
<p>-<span>  </span>Microphones + amp +
cables/stands</p>
<p>The total needed for opening the doors to students is estimated at <u>40,000
euros</u>.  The description of the
expenditures can be found in the table below. 
Lease/utilities and salaries are considered for a period of 6 months,
until the school is self-sustainable. </p>
<p>Should the full amount not be collected, we will still pursue the project,
on a smaller scale (e.g. less space and equipment or a location less central
and convenient).</p>

Combined with our passion for helping others changing their lives, we are embarking on a journey to create world class software craftsman of unemployed, resource-poor South Africans.By working hard and being passionate about Software Development, Mandla has changed the life of him and his family. Read more about why this is so important to Mandla and Theo. You can also watch a talk Mandla did on the topic at RubyFuza, a local developer conference.By contributing to our campaign, you can change the trajectory of one of over 50% of South Africa's unemployed youth boys and girls, to not only help them provide for their families, but also help shape the future of their Country and Continent.What do we need?In short, we need ~$170 000, this will allow us to secure funding for a minimum of 30 students (our stretch goal would be 80 students) for a year, with either one full-time craftsmen to mentor, or two part-time craftsmen.Your contribution will go to the following:
A premises able to accommodate the 30 students.
Equipment including mid-level laptops for the students, network infrastructure, an internet connection, projectors and other items needed
Monthly utility bill including water & electricity 
A travel stipend that will help the students get to and from the grounds
2 Meals per student per day
Furniture
A Library of relevant books
Creation of additional coursework
Because we aim for The Coding Ground to be completely self-sufficient, we will work with companies so that the students' fees are entirely sponsored with the obligation to work for the sponsoring company for a year.

The privilege of helping someone realize that they are capable of so much is a massive responsibility. Watch a video of Moral, a Sisonke Rising student, sharing what a difference Sisonke Rising has made in his life.To A CountryThe average wage for a low-skilled individual in South Africa is around $9 per day if they even are employed. With your contribution and The Coding Ground's mentorship, the student will immediately go to earning a starting salary almost three times as much, with the potential of tripling that salary again in a matter of ~3 years.The change does not just stop at earning a salary, however.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p></p>
<p>""Never work with animals or children.""</p>
<p>-W.C. Fields, a player in early-American cinema</p>
<p>Although we greatly appreciate the advice Mr. Fields has shared with us, <i><b>TADPOLES</b></i> is a film that involves the participation of animals and children exclusively.</p>
<p>That's right! Two kids out in nature, a Norwegian slug, a ferocious billygoat, a noble Fjord horse, about two dozen sheep, and some tadpoles -- are the components of our film.</p>
<p>What were we thinking, you might ask? Well, we're creating a film <b>FOR</b> children who are experiencing the world <b>AS CHILDREN</b>. So, therefore, we wanted to <b>INCLUDE CHILDREN</b> and anything children may find admirable, exciting, or familiar - which in this case... are <b>ANIMALS</b>.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a challenge and some may see this as a risk, but the film we've come together to create is the film we will accomplish together. We have a wonderful crew, very talented specialists on board to assist us with these 'challenging' aspects, and two child stars who are eager to help us bring this beautiful vision home!</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, if we raise our funding goal - we feel confident that we will have enough <b>time </b>and <b>resources</b> to 'pull it off' and make something that will not only move young audiences, but will inspire them to explore the foreign film genre, subtitled films, foreign languages, and last but not least, the world outside their own.</p>

<h2>TUSEN TAKK &amp; FARVEL ...</h2>

</div></div>","THE STORY

Mikey, a 7 year-old American gutt (boy), who has recently moved to Norge (Norway), is having trouble adjusting to his new surroundings. When these troubles become too overwhelming for him, Mikey runs away and ends up lost... in Norway... with only himself and his backpack but, not to fear!
Astrid, a precocious, 7 year-old, Norwegian jente (girl) finds Mikey. She is just the person to help Mikey find his way back to his hus (house). Along the way, Astrid invites Mikey to explore Norway alongside her, she introduces him to all of her animal venner (friends), and she even begins to show him how to make Norway his hjem (home).

EXT. BILLY GOAT FIELD - DAY (Concept Art by Lauren Holzer)
THE SUBTITLES
Although Mikey speaks Engelsk (English) and Astrid speaks Norsk (Norwegian), the two children find ways to help and understand each other.
As Mikey and Astrid embark on their adventure together, they (and the audience) must negotiate the language barriers.
Barn (Children) who watch TADPOLES and the series of films to follow will not only benefit from exposure to different cultures and languages, but also, can reinforce their reading abilities by following the subtitles in their native languages.
TADPOLES is a foreign subtitled film designed and crafted for young audiences and new readers

EXT. SHEEP HILLSIDE - AFTERNOON (Concept Art by Lauren Holzer)

THE FOREIGN FILM

TADPOLES will be the first in a line of movies designed to introduce children to different cultures, different languages, and different backgrounds so that young audiences may broaden their perspectives on the world around them.
It is important to introduce young audiences to the lives of other kids around the world so that they can wrestle with ideas and questions of culture during their formative years.
TADPOLES could be a child's first foreign subtitled film and could help them to develop the toolkit they will need to prosper in this increasingly interconnected world.

Risks & Challenges 
""Never work with animals or children.""
-W.C. Fields, a player in early-American cinema
Although we greatly appreciate the advice Mr. Fields has shared with us, TADPOLES is a film that involves the participation of animals and children exclusively.
That's right! Two kids out in nature, a Norwegian slug, a ferocious billygoat, a noble Fjord horse, about two dozen sheep, and some tadpoles -- are the components of our film.
What were we thinking, you might ask? Well, we're creating a film FOR children who are experiencing the world AS CHILDREN. So, therefore, we wanted to INCLUDE CHILDREN and anything children may find admirable, exciting, or familiar - which in this case... are ANIMALS.
Yes, this is a challenge and some may see this as a risk, but the film we've come together to create is the film we will accomplish together. We have a wonderful crew, very talented specialists on board to assist us with these 'challenging' aspects, and two child stars who are eager to help us bring this beautiful vision home!
When it comes down to it, if we raise our funding goal - we feel confident that we will have enough time and resources to 'pull it off' and make something that will not only move young audiences, but will inspire them to explore the foreign film genre, subtitled films, foreign languages, and last but not least, the world outside their own.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Alan Bray I'm the founder of Bray Media. I've worked in the sales segment of several technology organizations and have a data-driven and strategic mindset. I'm a diversity and inclusion enthusiast. I love to help and motivate people to accelerate in their prospective careers; that's why I decided to create a platform that put diversity first. <br/>I've started this campaign because I'm in the new pre-seed process of developing my company, and I'm looking to create an MVP (Proto-type) to show investors and grow my brand, but I need your help.<br/>By funding Bray Media, you contribute to the foundation of my platform and a solution that will mend the gap where luck meets opportunity for so many young minority business professionals. During this stage, helping my company will help create a solution that's needed for so many minority business professionals to give them the competency that will allow them to strive within their perspective careers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Bray Media LLC needs $20,000 to help build our MVP. It will cost $8,000 to fund the UI/UX developer to create and design my web-based platform. $6,000 pays for the OTT (Over The Top) media integration needed to help business professionals upload and stream presentation content (Live, Broadcast, Video, Podcast). $3,000 goes to marketing for brand awareness and content strategies (Ad campaigns, marketing content, Hootsuite, google ads). $3,000 will go towards the back end, recruiting platform integration. </p>
<p>Bray Media will act as an access -point for digital content for young minority business professionals. The platform will provide users with media content (Video Podcast, Podcast, Masterclass presentations, blog forums ) to access first-hand introductions from influential business professionals. The latter inspires to motivate, educate, and inspire youth to create a more diverse workforce. <br/>If I don't reach my entire goal, the funding will still go towards the Bray Media platform's design and development. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have in mind to create a secure and reliable platform operating in the inclusion based edTech industry. We have in mind to create valuable content that promotes and incentives user awareness under various themes by including diversity acceptance, inclusion, and social worth. This will enable underrepresented minorities with the access of content that accelerates their perspective careers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>A 2019 survey by Schoology indicated that 15% of students in the United States are without access to broadband internet. Since then, the coronavirus pandemic has created a virtual schooling environment, which resulted in an unavoidable learning and achievement gap. <br/>Many internet providers stepped in to offer free Wi-Fi access to ensure that students could continue learning. Still, broadband internet is, unfortunately, not the only barrier to student success in online environments. As online learning remains the new normal, educators must employ best practice strategies to make this experience inclusive and welcoming. Giving careful consideration to students’ various learning styles and needs will help create positive experiences, even when teaching and learning from a distance. </p>
<p>A comprehensive online course welcomes content that is diversified and speaks to all students in the online classroom. Course content should be free of implicit and explicit bias and filtered through a multicultural lens. A successful online class will always promote diversity and inclusion, and invite students to participate meaningfully in their learning community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, I completely understand that it's tough to set out additional funds during these times. But one way you can help is to promote this product via Facebook, Instagram, and Linkedin. Regardless of your financial capabilities to contribute, I believe that it is mandatory to spread the word about this platform.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Welcome to Bilin Academy</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> <a href=""http://www.bilin.academy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.bilin.academy</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A global language immersion classroom for bilingual children.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Our Purpose.</strong></h3>
<p>Empower children worldwide by giving them access to multilingual, global, diverse education. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Our Background.</strong></h3>
<p>The birth of BILIN Academy comes from a personal interest in teaching, studying languages and intercultural connections. Growing up, I was educated in a monolingual, monocultural curriculum. I was always eager to see the outside world. Studying in the US was a life-changing event that reshaped my way of thinking and vision for the world. Now I want to bring children worldwide an international classroom experience, where they can learn their subjects of interest from professionals worldwide and acquire a second language while doing it.</p>
<p>We believe our classes not only provide children with a better way to learn a second language, but also help to promote global understanding and respect of cultural differences among our next generation of global citizens.</p>
</div><div><p> </p></div><div>
<h3><strong>Our Impact on Global Education.</strong></h3>
<p>Our classes represent the next wave in language learning. we support <strong>content and language integrated learning approach</strong> where students learn a subject and a second language at the same time. We offer 100% language immersion class on different subjects, taught by native speaker teachers.  Here are some examples:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>Weiqi/Go Class (Mandarin Immersion)</li>
<li>Fashion Design Class (Mandarin Immersion)</li>
<li>Classical Chinese Poetry Painting Class (Mandarin Immersion)</li>
<li>Harry Potter Art Class (English Immersion)</li>
<li>Chess Class (English Immersion)</li>
<li>Making your own piñata (Spanish Immersion)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each class distinctly caters to children's interests as well as bringing out cultural motifs in the respective language. </p>
<p>Our students hail from all over the world including China, the UK, Japan, Vietnam, Australia, and Canada. We have reached 1000 account registrations and 200 active students after a year of launching our website.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Our Project &amp; Perks</strong></h3>
<p>Our greatest project right now is technological development. We have already begun working on an app that will make it more convenient to sign up for class, share assignments directly with teachers and get feedback, get class reminders, and allow parents and students to connect with each other in class groups.  It will also have smart functions such as making recommendations based on a student’s interest and language level. These specific details may come in stages, but the idea is that the app will improve the whole Bilin Academy experience for students, parents, and teachers.</p>
<p>We are asking for $50,000 to support our continuing website and app development.</p>
<ul>
<li>For every dollar you give to us, we’ll give you the equal amount of credits toward our classes, valid at any time in the future.</li>
<li>Donating to our project is a great way to support worldwide language learning and to become an advocate of the Bilin community.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're offering special prices for class credits, which you can use for your own child or give to someone else. Take advantage of this offer in our indiegogo campaign. Click on the perks for more information.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Currently our classes are only in Mandarin and English. We hope to expand to other languages, but it will be difficult because we do not have the contacts readily available. We hope to include many languages such as Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and more.</p>
<p>How to do this? We already have a well-built system for English and Mandarin classes, so we do have a head start towards our goal of adding more languages. We have a strong customer base and ways to find and interact with people in different countries. Our plan is to focus first on hiring Spanish-speaking and Japanese-speaking teachers through online platforms and slowly increase our reach.</p>

 www.bilin.academy
 
A global language immersion classroom for bilingual children.
 
Our Purpose.
Empower children worldwide by giving them access to multilingual, global, diverse education. 
 
Our Background.
The birth of BILIN Academy comes from a personal interest in teaching, studying languages and intercultural connections. Growing up, I was educated in a monolingual, monocultural curriculum. I was always eager to see the outside world. Studying in the US was a life-changing event that reshaped my way of thinking and vision for the world. Now I want to bring children worldwide an international classroom experience, where they can learn their subjects of interest from professionals worldwide and acquire a second language while doing it.
We believe our classes not only provide children with a better way to learn a second language, but also help to promote global understanding and respect of cultural differences among our next generation of global citizens.
 
Our Impact on Global Education.
Our classes represent the next wave in language learning. we support content and language integrated learning approach where students learn a subject and a second language at the same time. We offer 100% language immersion class on different subjects, taught by native speaker teachers.  Here are some examples:
 

Weiqi/Go Class (Mandarin Immersion)
Fashion Design Class (Mandarin Immersion)
Classical Chinese Poetry Painting Class (Mandarin Immersion)
Harry Potter Art Class (English Immersion)
Chess Class (English Immersion)
Making your own piñata (Spanish Immersion)

Each class distinctly caters to children's interests as well as bringing out cultural motifs in the respective language. 
Our students hail from all over the world including China, the UK, Japan, Vietnam, Australia, and Canada. We have reached 1000 account registrations and 200 active students after a year of launching our website.
 
Our Project & Perks
Our greatest project right now is technological development. We have already begun working on an app that will make it more convenient to sign up for class, share assignments directly with teachers and get feedback, get class reminders, and allow parents and students to connect with each other in class groups.  It will also have smart functions such as making recommendations based on a student’s interest and language level. These specific details may come in stages, but the idea is that the app will improve the whole Bilin Academy experience for students, parents, and teachers.
We are asking for $50,000 to support our continuing website and app development.

For every dollar you give to us, we’ll give you the equal amount of credits toward our classes, valid at any time in the future.
Donating to our project is a great way to support worldwide language learning and to become an advocate of the Bilin community.

We're offering special prices for class credits, which you can use for your own child or give to someone else. Take advantage of this offer in our indiegogo campaign. Click on the perks for more information.
 


Risks & Challenges
Currently our classes are only in Mandarin and English. We hope to expand to other languages, but it will be difficult because we do not have the contacts readily available. We hope to include many languages such as Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and more.
How to do this? We already have a well-built system for English and Mandarin classes, so we do have a head start towards our goal of adding more languages. We have a strong customer base and ways to find and interact with people in different countries. Our plan is to focus first on hiring Spanish-speaking and Japanese-speaking teachers through online platforms and slowly increase our reach.

<p><u><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></u></p>
<p>Hi. My name is Sam Weaver and I live with my wife in Norfolk, Virginia (USA). I’m semi-retired from a lifetime of working mostly in sales, marketing and sales management. I’ve also taught business courses at several colleges. Recently I came across a company that’s making an impact on the business world and I want to help them grow and reach more business owners and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p><u><strong>WHY THIS?</strong></u></p>
<p>Forbes magazine tells us that 90% of new business FAIL. We’ve all seen businesses that have gone under after just a short time. Harvard Review tell us the number one reason for business failure is Lack of Experience. For instance, someone opens a restaurant because they love to cook and create scrumptious meals. They’re so good at it, their friends and family convince them they should go into the restaurant business, and maybe even help with the initial funding. But being a good cook isn’t enough, is it? They need to know how to staff and train their employees, how to properly market to attract customers, how to manage the business, how to keep records, develop a website, become knowledgeable about the legal issues, etc., etc.</p>
<p>Where does a business owner get the training they need? Universities offer MBA programs, but who has both the time to attend classes and the thousands of dollars required for tuition, books, etc?</p>
<p>Now there’s an answer… Digital Business Training. We provide the courses needed by business owners and entrepreneurs for a fraction of what the universities charge for their MBA courses. Most of ours are less than $100 each and almost all are under $300 each. We also offer personal coaching and live 3-day seminars featuring some of the best business trainers from around the world. Since we offer these courses digitally, we can make them available to anyone anywhere in the world… Cleveland to Cairo, Austin to Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Our goal for this project is $38,000. That’s the total needed to become positioned as a Top Consultant and for the training which requires me to first complete some weeks-long online courses (done), then to attend several live-event training sessions in the months ahead. The amount also allows for initial marketing costs.</p>
<p>When I taught college business courses, I could only reach a small number of students at a time. Now, through this digital format, we can reach thousands! To me, that’s exciting. Knowing how beneficial these top-notch courses are gives me the satisfaction of making a positive impact on the business world. I believe it’s our duty to “Pay It Forward” to the best of our ability. If you agree, please support this effort.</p>
<p><u><strong>WHAT DO YOU GET?</strong></u></p>
<p>First, of course, there’s a great feeling that comes from helping a business, any legitimate business, get up and running. And if that new business is one that provides critical help for OTHER businesses to survive and thrive, then that good feeling is multiplied many times. But it’s not just about the feelings… there are tangibles, too.</p>
<p>You’ll see there are different levels of “perks” based on your donation amount. You’ll receive a list to choose which course(s) you’d like to have, FREE for your donation. It might be something that will benefit your personal development, or something that will help you be a better businessperson or entrepreneur. Or, maybe you’d like your “perk” be a gift to someone you know who is struggling in business. The choice is entirely yours. The point is, you’ll be receiving good value for your involvement in helping us reach our goal and helping business people and entrepreneurs worldwide.</p>
<p><u><strong>WHAT IF WE FALL SHORT OF THE GOAL… OR GO OVER IT?</strong></u></p>
<p>This effort will go forward regardless of the amount of the total funding. If we fall short, it will just make progress slower. We’ll need to use the proceeds from sales to fund further training and marketing. I am totally dedicated to making this work because it’s so important to help struggling businesses.</p>
<p>If we go over the goal, it means we can do more marketing to spread the word that what we have is available, worldwide. It also allows for more training for myself and others that come on board to assist. More trained consultants means more personal business coaching we can offer.</p>
<p><u><strong>IF YOU CAN’T CONTRIBUTE BUT STILL WANT TO HELP…</strong></u></p>
<p>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. Indiegogo provides some “share” tools for this purpose. Think of all the people you know, not just business people and entrepreneurs. Use your email list, Facebook, Twitter, and any other means to spread the word. Believe me, it all helps.</p>

Hi. My name is Sam Weaver and I live with my wife in Norfolk, Virginia (USA). I’m semi-retired from a lifetime of working mostly in sales, marketing and sales management. I’ve also taught business courses at several colleges. Recently I came across a company that’s making an impact on the business world and I want to help them grow and reach more business owners and entrepreneurs.
WHY THIS?
Forbes magazine tells us that 90% of new business FAIL. We’ve all seen businesses that have gone under after just a short time. Harvard Review tell us the number one reason for business failure is Lack of Experience. For instance, someone opens a restaurant because they love to cook and create scrumptious meals. They’re so good at it, their friends and family convince them they should go into the restaurant business, and maybe even help with the initial funding. But being a good cook isn’t enough, is it? They need to know how to staff and train their employees, how to properly market to attract customers, how to manage the business, how to keep records, develop a website, become knowledgeable about the legal issues, etc., etc.
Where does a business owner get the training they need? Universities offer MBA programs, but who has both the time to attend classes and the thousands of dollars required for tuition, books, etc?

Since we offer these courses digitally, we can make them available to anyone anywhere in the world… Cleveland to Cairo, Austin to Amsterdam.
Our goal for this project is $38,000. That’s the total needed to become positioned as a Top Consultant and for the training which requires me to first complete some weeks-long online courses (done), then to attend several live-event training sessions in the months ahead. The amount also allows for initial marketing costs.
When I taught college business courses, I could only reach a small number of students at a time. Now, through this digital format, we can reach thousands! To me, that’s exciting. Knowing how beneficial these top-notch courses are gives me the satisfaction of making a positive impact on the business world. I believe it’s our duty to “Pay It Forward” to the best of our ability. If you agree, please support this effort.
WHAT DO YOU GET?
First, of course, there’s a great feeling that comes from helping a business, any legitimate business, get up and running. And if that new business is one that provides critical help for OTHER businesses to survive and thrive, then that good feeling is multiplied many times. But it’s not just about the feelings… there are tangibles, too.
You’ll see there are different levels of “perks” based on your donation amount. You’ll receive a list to choose which course(s) you’d like to have, FREE for your donation.

Or, maybe you’d like your “perk” be a gift to someone you know who is struggling in business. The choice is entirely yours. The point is, you’ll be receiving good value for your involvement in helping us reach our goal and helping business people and entrepreneurs worldwide.
WHAT IF WE FALL SHORT OF THE GOAL… OR GO OVER IT?
This effort will go forward regardless of the amount of the total funding. If we fall short, it will just make progress slower. We’ll need to use the proceeds from sales to fund further training and marketing. I am totally dedicated to making this work because it’s so important to help struggling businesses.
If we go over the goal, it means we can do more marketing to spread the word that what we have is available, worldwide. It also allows for more training for myself and others that come on board to assist. More trained consultants means more personal business coaching we can offer.

<p>HELP US IMPROVE <strong>MORE THAN 25,000</strong> LIVES BY PROVIDING <strong>HIGH QUALITY</strong> ENVIRONMENTAL <strong>EDUCATION</strong> TO <strong>CHILDREN</strong> LIVING IN LAKE ATITLAN, <strong>GUATEMALA</strong>.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499899536/ozf95qppuapej32mmfxw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p><strong>Friends of Lake Atitlán</strong> is a NGO fighting to improve the quality of life of its communities here in rural Guatemala, by promoting and facilitating <strong>environmental education</strong>, <strong>rescue</strong> and <strong>sanitation</strong> of Lake Atitlan, <strong>reforestation</strong> and <strong>scientific research</strong> since <strong>1990</strong>.</p>
<p>We have developed a very important and <strong>unique program</strong> in environmental education designed specifically for the needs and <strong>context of Lake Atitlán</strong>. We seek to sensitize, promote, and encourage participation in caring for our natural resources.</p>
<p>The educational material <strong><i>Education for Conservation</i></strong> encompasses activities, experiments, and thoughts aimed at helping to learn about <strong>sustainable ecological practices</strong> and habits. Friends of the Lake created this concept in collaboration with the Guatemala’s Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and local and international institutions. With great effort, we have succeeded in making this project sustainable, although we receive no funds from governmental organizations. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499311052/mtv2myvhokc2elgonvyr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In 2011 we published all this material for the use of <strong>principals, teachers</strong>, and <strong>students</strong> of the <strong>elementary school</strong> level. In 2013 we expanded the program to students in the <strong>junior high-school </strong>school level and, in 2015, for the<strong> high-school </strong>level.</p>
<p>Through the years, we have distributed <strong>more than 10,000 copies</strong> of <strong><i>Education for Conservation</i></strong> in <strong>19 municipalities</strong> of the Sololá region. Distribution of these texts goes hand-in-hand with <strong>training </strong>and <strong>strengthening the capacities </strong>of the teaching staff and directors through <strong>technical and pedagogical</strong> means, and implementation of environmental knowledge. We are currently working in <strong>110 public schools</strong>. Our challenge is to achieve monitoring and follow-up of this material in all the schools of the department of Sololá.  </p>

<p>More than <strong>3,000 teachers, 680 directors</strong>,and <strong>95,000 students</strong> have taken part in this program.</p>

<p>Lake Atitlán basin has a population of approximately <strong>400,000</strong> of which half are under the age of 18. <strong>Only 50% </strong>are assisted by the official education system. </p>
<p>The <strong><i>Education for Conservation </i></strong>materials are our main tools. These <strong>books</strong> are already a few years old and we <strong>need to update </strong>them because much has changed here in Guatemala. For example, the Lake's water quality is affecting our health and it is urgent that we get the message out. </p>
<p>The team must gather <strong>new information, research</strong> and <strong>analyze</strong> the entire situation, in order to update, print, and distribute new manuals. We would also like to <strong>broaden the coverage</strong> of the program.  For all that, we need more sponsors and funds to reach this goal. </p>
<p>We cannot achieve this without your generous support. Please sponsor our project. Let’s do this together. Let’s change the world one student at a time.</p>

<p>Since the Association took its first steps in 1990, Friends of Lake Atitlán grew rapidly. Now we are a <strong>family</strong> of <strong>25 members</strong>: employees, neighbors, volunteers, engineers, scientists working in different departments such as Sanitation and Rescue of the Lake, Reforestation, Scientific Research and, of course, Environmental Education. </p>

<p>This team includes <strong>9 members</strong>, all <strong>young</strong> and <strong>passionate</strong> environmental education promotors from Lake Atitlán basin. They speak Spanish and their Mayan languages - Tz'utujil and Kaqchikel - so they can easily connect with the children and teaching staff.</p>

HELP US IMPROVE MORE THAN 25,000 LIVES BY PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION TO CHILDREN LIVING IN LAKE ATITLAN, GUATEMALA.

Friends of Lake Atitlán is a NGO fighting to improve the quality of life of its communities here in rural Guatemala, by promoting and facilitating environmental education, rescue and sanitation of Lake Atitlan, reforestation and scientific research since 1990.
We have developed a very important and unique program in environmental education designed specifically for the needs and context of Lake Atitlán. We seek to sensitize, promote, and encourage participation in caring for our natural resources.
The educational material Education for Conservation encompasses activities, experiments, and thoughts aimed at helping to learn about sustainable ecological practices and habits. Friends of the Lake created this concept in collaboration with the Guatemala’s Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and local and international institutions. With great effort, we have succeeded in making this project sustainable, although we receive no funds from governmental organizations. 

In 2011 we published all this material for the use of principals, teachers, and students of the elementary school level. In 2013 we expanded the program to students in the junior high-school school level and, in 2015, for the high-school level.
Through the years, we have distributed more than 10,000 copies of Education for Conservation in 19 municipalities of the Sololá region. Distribution of these texts goes hand-in-hand with training and strengthening the capacities of the teaching staff and directors through technical and pedagogical means, and implementation of environmental knowledge. We are currently working in 110 public schools. Our challenge is to achieve monitoring and follow-up of this material in all the schools of the department of Sololá.  

More than 3,000 teachers, 680 directors,and 95,000 students have taken part in this program.

Lake Atitlán basin has a population of approximately 400,000 of which half are under the age of 18. Only 50% are assisted by the official education system. 
The Education for Conservation materials are our main tools. These books are already a few years old and we need to update them because much has changed here in Guatemala. For example, the Lake's water quality is affecting our health and it is urgent that we get the message out. 
The team must gather new information, research and analyze the entire situation, in order to update, print, and distribute new manuals. We would also like to broaden the coverage of the program.  For all that, we need more sponsors and funds to reach this goal. 
We cannot achieve this without your generous support. Please sponsor our project. Let’s do this together. Let’s change the world one student at a time.

Since the Association took its first steps in 1990, Friends of Lake Atitlán grew rapidly. Now we are a family of 25 members: employees, neighbors, volunteers, engineers, scientists working in different departments such as Sanitation and Rescue of the Lake, Reforestation, Scientific Research and, of course, Environmental Education. 

This team includes 9 members, all young and passionate environmental education promotors from Lake Atitlán basin. They speak Spanish and their Mayan languages - Tz'utujil and Kaqchikel - so they can easily connect with the children and teaching staff.


We estimate that the full cost of updating, graphic design, and printing of the new educational materials will add up to US$30,000.


 

Sponsored Perks: Together with the Jeweller's Papidu /Joyería Papidu, La Noria Shopping Center, Grønn, Guatemalan Coffee, painter Humberto Garavito and sundry Arts and crafts we are offering some amazing gifts in return for your donations. Don't forget to keep following us; more gifts are on the way!          **See right-hand side of page for details!**

They create high quality, hand made glasses and planters manufactured by mothers that live around Guatemala's City landfill, upcycling glass bottles. They work in partnership with an NGO Guatemaltecos Extraordinarios that provides education for kids at risk of falling in gangs or drugs, through employing mothers, so kids can have better opportunities and a brighter future. 

Guatemalan paintor Humberto Garavito (1897-1970)
Well-known Humberto Garavito was one of the most famous landscape paintor of the 20th century in Central America. After his studies in Madrid and Paris, he became the Director of the Academia de Bellas Artes of Guatemala.He was able to capture the natural beauty of Lake Atitlan and its colorful mayan villages. We offer you 6 different litographs from his oil on canvas artwork.

Gronn es una empresa guatemalteca que fabrique productos reciclados de alta calidad para el hogar, hechos de manera artesanal, reutilizando botellas de vidrio que han sido recolectadas en diferentes puntos en Ciudad de Guatemala y así dándoles un segundo ciclo de vida a las botellas, fabricando vasos, macetas, floreros, entre otros productos. Gronn trabaja de la mano con una ONG Guatemaltecos Extraordinarios que se preocupa por brindar mejoras sociales a familias de alto riesgo en la ciudad.  Todas las empleadas son mujeres del área del relleno sanitario, así sus niños tendrán mejores oportunidades en el futuro.

El pintor guatemalteco Humberto Garavito (1897-1970)
El famoso pintor garavito fue uno de los pintores de Centroamerica más reconocidos del sigglo 20. Estudió en Madrid y París, luego retornó a Guatemala en 1927, y el año siguiente desempeñó la dirección de la Academia de Bellas Artes. Su técnica preferida fue el óleo sobre tela  y su tema predilecto, el paisaje. Logró captar la belleza del Lago de Atitlán, sus pueblos y trajes de gran colorido. Les ofrecemos 6 litografías de sus obras en donde se pueden admirar las perfectas equivalencias entre luz y color.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Throughout the past 8 or 10 years, I developed a stock trading system that I believe to be the <u><i><strong>SAFEST</strong></i></u>, <u><i><strong>SIMPLIEST</strong></i></u> and most <u><i><strong>ACCURATE</strong></i></u> way to trade in decades. This system takes 99% of the fear out of trading.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I originally designed and developed this system for my own personal use, but once I found the potential it has, I wanted to share it with others, especially with those who want the opportunity to take control of their own finances.</p>
<h3>About My Campaign</h3>
<p>The campaign is two fold. Both facets have the same level of importance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The first is to generate the needed funds to continue the completion of our web-site along with having a strong marketing plan for the site -- keyword research for in-marketing display advertising, robot tag ads and in-depth market research.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Second is to educate the hundreds of thousands of individuals that have <strong>NO 401k and/or Pension plan</strong>, which is about 60% of our work force today. There is a strong need to help individuals that would like to have such a system.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMIeTqDjs5Y?rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" style=""width: 614px;height: 340px;""></iframe></div></div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Accomplishing a <u><i><strong>successful</strong></i></u> campaign is essential so that <u><i><strong>we</strong></i></u> may continue to advance <u><i><strong>our</strong></i></u> important message of financial self-determination to those thousands mentioned above. There is NO reason for anyone to spend hours and hours in research any more.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503204127/tegvynjwxd99yfyu3vmk.png"" src=""""/></div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We did the hard work! We eliminated the need for complicated chart analysis and interpretation of seemingly endless financial data. Now ordinary folks can learn to generate that extra income they need not just for today, <strong>but for years ahead</strong>.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I'm looking to fund a $25,000 marketing, research and automation project for my methodology.  I do have a web site <strong><a href=""http://www.123etf.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.123etf.com</a></strong>, nearly completed already that will host the education service and I have written the training materials for the subscription service based on my core methodology.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The marketing plan includes hiring a local marketing firm to produce demographically targeted click ads to attract subscribers and to monitor the success of those campaigns and adjust as necessary. The estimate for this service is about half of the funds I seek.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The research and automation portion of the project has the most <strong>visionary and exciting</strong> purpose. The first major objective will be to accomplish the automation of the original methodology, allowing it to continue to <strong>run on it's own</strong>, but also to generate the daily analysis that goes into providing subscribers with timely trading information. Beyond that, I will seek to automate and test several of the most promising variations of my core system which I have come up with over the years, but have not had the time (due to sheer volume of information) to properly vet.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503008177/jjsuy9o1lczynzpyvk42.png"" src=""""/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The goal of this ongoing automation and research will be to provide subscribers to my service with the most productive set of proven trading options that <strong>suit their needs</strong> and to <strong>provide timely and relevant recommendations</strong> through the service. I want to grow this trader education service beyond a one-size-fits-all approach so that traders of different means, availability and proficiency will all find a home here and a proven plan<strong> they can use successfully</strong>. Please note, this trader education service will be launched with my original core methodology as the offering, but with the plans in full motions for the expansion and adaptation I have described to the extent possible based on this success of this campaign.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Any remaining funds will go toward enhancing the educational materials and presentations of the service, including enlisting professional video production. However, I expect revenue from a growing subscriber base to be the main source of ongoing improvements to training materials. The training scripts, demos and other materials I have already produced will be refined and recorded as professional training sessions available only to subscribers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Subscribers will not only have access to this simple and easily implemented core trading program, and ultimately to proven variations of it, but will also have materials at their disposal <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502832103/hhleg7bv0co3c02wpbdh.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 320px;margin-left:10px;float: right;""/> that will allow them to go as far into the details of the thought process behind this methodology as they may choose. <strong>Subscribers will be in control</strong>. If they wish, they will be able to go on autopilot, using the service for nothing more than our daily recommendations and results, or they will be able to go further to develop a deeper expertise as traders.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Having a successful campaign will mean that we will be well on our way to delivering this important service to those countless individuals I mentioned above <strong>who I believe need and have been waiting for</strong> a <strong>SAFE, SIMPLE and ACCURATE</strong> system such as mine.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There is <strong>NO</strong> reason that anyone needs to spend hours and hours in research any more or shell out exorbitant amounts in ""advisor fees"" in return for often questionable advice.</p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502832592/qulvbcisvowzmmwdvomq.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 120px;margin-right:10px;float: left;""/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The hard work of trial and error and the pain and lessons of uncontrolled losses are behind me. <u><i><strong>This methodology is ready for prime time</strong></i></u>.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Should this funding goal not be met entirely, priority will have to be given to marketing efforts. For without the ability to put the word out for a successful launch, all else is impossible.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, even if I can only launch with my core trading methodology, it couldn't be more ready to serve what I believe is a vast and <strong>hungry base of potential subscribers</strong> who have <strong>long been waiting</strong> for such an opportunity. <strong>Please help me to make it happen</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If this funding campaign does not succeed in reaching even enough of the funding goal to pay for an aggressive marketing program, that plan will have to be scaled back initially as well.

<h3>I'm on a Mission! Why you should join me...</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The world is awash in cash. I recently read that there's enough currency in the world to give every man, woman and child the equivalent of 1 billion U.S. dollars. <strong>Yet</strong>, in the most prosperous nation the world has even known, a large majority of the population will work all their lives to survive with no hope of a secure retirement, and 43.1 million people live below the poverty level. <u><i><strong>This does not have to be the case</strong></i></u>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The stock market, yes the same stock market the ""experts"" have told you is far too complicated for you to navigate without them, is a great American free enterprise pathway to prosperity.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I said it can be simple. I didn't say easy. It's not easy because we allow emotions, a lack of discipline, so-called ""experts"" and confusing approaches to complicate things for us. <strong>It's time to put all that to a stop.</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The only impediment that I see standing in the way of achieving my goal is if this campaign fails to generate enough backers like yourself.

My name’s Sylvia Arthur and I'm the founder of Libreria, a library for adults in Accra, Ghana, which I started in 2017 with approximately 1,300 of my own books.</p><p>It all began back in 2010 when I moved from London to Brussels for work and I began buying books to overcome the sense of loneliness I felt at being alone in a new city. Every week, I’d trek to my favourite second-hand bookstore and search out the latest fiction and nonfiction titles among the stacks. I’d leave with a bag full of books by diverse authors set in countries around the world on wide-ranging themes that enlightened, entertained, and inspired.</p><p>But the books soon outgrew my apartment so I began shipping them to my mum’s house in Ghana for safekeeping.</p><p>Whenever I’d visit my mum and see the books gathering dust, I’d feel guilty about them being there and not being read when there were thousands who could benefit from them. It was then that I got the idea for a library.</p><p>It took six years and a lot of passion and dedication, but I finally opened Libreria in Accra in December 2017.</p><p>Because all the books were my own, Libreria is primarily a library for adults. However, even before we officially opened, I was constantly being asked, “Do you have any children’s books?”</p><p>Libreria Kids seeks to address this need with a separate library, especially for children. We want to rent the space opposite the original adult library making it easy for families to visit both. </p><h3><strong>Why Libreria Kids is important</strong></h3><p>The library will offer high-quality, culturally-relevant books and programmes for children, from toddlers through to young adults (YA). Through its offering, we aim to cultivate a love of reading amongst children, and use books to ignite their imaginations to the possibilities of the world. Libreria Kids will serve its community and its members with passion and dedication.</p><h3><strong>What your contribution will do</strong></h3><p>Libreria Kids is not just about giving children any-old books, but giving them access to the right kind of books that reflect the reality of who they are and where they’re from. I want children in Ghana to experience the joy of seeing themselves in a book they pick off the shelf. They may also discover books that offer mind-expanding possibilities or become their first passport to the world.</p><p>By doing this, Libreria Kids will make a huge difference to young people’s lives through improved literacy, enhanced knowledge, and increased self-confidence.</p><p>Please join me in achieving this important mission.</p><h3><strong>What we need &amp; what you get</strong></h3><p>We need $20,000 to:</p><ul>
<li>rent the library space for two years. After that, we aim to be self-sustaining.</li>
<li>buy the necessary fixtures and fittings (e.g. shelving, projector and screen, and wifi).</li>
<li>buy child-friendly furnishings (e.g. chairs, desks, toys).</li>
<li>purchase new, culturally-relevant books to add to our current, small children’s section.</li>
<li>pay for one staff member to look after the library.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Our way of saying thank you!</strong></h3><p>By donating to this campaign, not only will you get to contribute to the development of a child’s love of reading, but you’ll also earn some major perks!</p><p>From unique badges featuring acclaimed African women writers to your name on a donors' plaque prominently displayed in the library, you won’t regret supporting our cause.</p><h3>If we don’t reach our goal...</h3><p>We’ll use whatever funds we raise to rent the space and work from there to make up the shortfall so your donation won’t be in vain!</p><h3>The impact</h3><p>The benefits of children developing a reading habit from an early age are well recognised.</p><p>A 2015 study by The Reading Agency (UK) found that the main outcomes of ‘recreational’ reading, for pleasure or empowerment, were “enjoyment, knowledge of the self and other people, social interaction, social and cultural capital, imagination, focus and flow, relaxation and mood regulation. Improvements in young children's communication abilities and longer-term education outcomes were also reported for early years children.”</p><p>When children, particularly African children, are confronted with the misguided belief that they’re inferior - that they’re less smart or less beautiful, that they come from “shithole countries” with no jobs and no future - the odds are stacked against them from the start. We aim to instill in our readers that their identity and their reality is just as valid as anyone else’s.  </p><h3>My experience with Libreria</h3><p>I opened Libreria in Accra at the end of 2017 using my own collection of books and completely self-funded the library.

</ul><h2><strong>Thank you for your support!</strong></h2></div>","Allow me to introduce myselfHello! My name’s Sylvia Arthur and I'm the founder of Libreria, a library for adults in Accra, Ghana, which I started in 2017 with approximately 1,300 of my own books.It all began back in 2010 when I moved from London to Brussels for work and I began buying books to overcome the sense of loneliness I felt at being alone in a new city. Every week, I’d trek to my favourite second-hand bookstore and search out the latest fiction and nonfiction titles among the stacks. I’d leave with a bag full of books by diverse authors set in countries around the world on wide-ranging themes that enlightened, entertained, and inspired.But the books soon outgrew my apartment so I began shipping them to my mum’s house in Ghana for safekeeping.Whenever I’d visit my mum and see the books gathering dust, I’d feel guilty about them being there and not being read when there were thousands who could benefit from them. It was then that I got the idea for a library.It took six years and a lot of passion and dedication, but I finally opened Libreria in Accra in December 2017.Because all the books were my own, Libreria is primarily a library for adults. However, even before we officially opened, I was constantly being asked, “Do you have any children’s books?”Libreria Kids seeks to address this need with a separate library, especially for children. We want to rent the space opposite the original adult library making it easy for families to visit both. Why Libreria Kids is importantThe library will offer high-quality, culturally-relevant books and programmes for children, from toddlers through to young adults (YA). Through its offering, we aim to cultivate a love of reading amongst children, and use books to ignite their imaginations to the possibilities of the world. Libreria Kids will serve its community and its members with passion and dedication.What your contribution will doLibreria Kids is not just about giving children any-old books, but giving them access to the right kind of books that reflect the reality of who they are and where they’re from. I want children in Ghana to experience the joy of seeing themselves in a book they pick off the shelf. They may also discover books that offer mind-expanding possibilities or become their first passport to the world.By doing this, Libreria Kids will make a huge difference to young people’s lives through improved literacy, enhanced knowledge, and increased self-confidence.Please join me in achieving this important mission.What we need & what you getWe need $20,000 to:
rent the library space for two years. After that, we aim to be self-sustaining.
buy the necessary fixtures and fittings (e.g. shelving, projector and screen, and wifi).
buy child-friendly furnishings (e.g. chairs, desks, toys).
purchase new, culturally-relevant books to add to our current, small children’s section.
pay for one staff member to look after the library.
Our way of saying thank you!By donating to this campaign, not only will you get to contribute to the development of a child’s love of reading, but you’ll also earn some major perks!From unique badges featuring acclaimed African women writers to your name on a donors' plaque prominently displayed in the library, you won’t regret supporting our cause.If we don’t reach our goal...We’ll use whatever funds we raise to rent the space and work from there to make up the shortfall so your donation won’t be in vain!The impactThe benefits of children developing a reading habit from an early age are well recognised.A 2015 study by The Reading Agency (UK) found that the main outcomes of ‘recreational’ reading, for pleasure or empowerment, were “enjoyment, knowledge of the self and other people, social interaction, social and cultural capital, imagination, focus and flow, relaxation and mood regulation. Improvements in young children's communication abilities and longer-term education outcomes were also reported for early years children.”When children, particularly African children, are confronted with the misguided belief that they’re inferior - that they’re less smart or less beautiful, that they come from “shithole countries” with no jobs and no future - the odds are stacked against them from the start. We aim to instill in our readers that their identity and their reality is just as valid as anyone else’s.  My experience with LibreriaI opened Libreria in Accra at the end of 2017 using my own collection of books and completely self-funded the library. Since it opened, we've had members come from all over the city, and from all walks of life, to browse and check out books from our extensive collection of high-quality, contemporary fiction and nonfiction. We remain the only lending library in Accra, if not Ghana. The most popular books are those by African authors, from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s extensive back catalogue to Ayobami Adebayo’s highly acclaimed 2017 debut, Stay With Me.All our books are catalogued online and patrons can view, hold and check out books using our online system.Since we opened on 15 December 2017, we’ve hosted, or will soon host, talks with local literary lights including the writer, Nii Ayikwei Parkes and international literary stars, like the Black British writer, Afua Hirsch. We also hold community events such as Games Nights, and recently launched a scholarship and mentoring programme for girls aged 12-17 called Libreria Scholars.Libreria has been featured and recommended in Time Out magazine in Accra and on Citi FM radio, and has made waves across the city and the country as Ghana’s leading literary space.Community supportWe’ve been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support we’ve had from people all over Ghana and the world.

<h3>Hi, my name is Isabelle Mary Fitzgerald.</h3>
<p>I am the founder of MY PEACEFUL UNIVERSE an organisation that teaches MIndfulness and Meditation to Children. I am also a Mum of two divine Children aged 8 and 11.</p>
<p>I’m sure like many parents and families joining this Crowdfunding Campaign you are extremely concerned about the mental health and wellbeing of our beautiful children.</p>
<p>As we speak 1 in 7 children suffer from a mental health issue. That is over half a million Australian children in any given year alone. What is truly alarming, 50% of mental health issues are now emerging between the ages of 4 and 14!</p>
<p>So many parents are asking me, what can we do? How can we reverse these worrying trends?</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Like a lot of children, I suffered low self-esteem and low self-image issues. In my early 20’s I was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa. This was a very difficult time for myself and my family and in my mid 30’s after having my 1st child, I began struggling with anxiety.</p>
<p>Discovering MEDITATION in my early 20’s really helped me manage a lot of my anxiety issues. But it was discovering MINDFULNESS that truly made a significant impact on my mental health and helped me become the mum that I am today.</p>
<p>Learn more about my story at <a href=""https://mypeacefuluniverse.org/pages/about-isabelle-mary-fitzgerald"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mypeacefuluniverse.org</a></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why Mindfulness and Meditation?</h3>
<p>Mindfulness and Meditation have now emerged as a fun and positive way to help children face a range of mental and emotional challenges in their young lives.</p>
<p><i><strong>Research now shows that 8 weeks of Mindfulness and Meditation practice can help rewire our brains for happiness, and help cultivate joy in children.</strong></i></p>
<p>Since starting my classes just this year I have been truly blessed to see first hand the positive effect Mindfulness and Meditation can have on a child's outlook on life.</p>
<p>In my classes, children learn how to still their minds and breath properly so they can manage sleep, stress and anxiety when it arises.</p>
<p>They also learn positive tools that help <i><strong>build confidence</strong></i>, <i><strong>resilience</strong></i> and <i><strong>self-awareness</strong></i>, as well as learn how to develop <i><strong>kindness</strong></i> and, <strong><i> </i></strong><i><strong>compassion</strong></i> towards themselves and others around them.</p>

I am the founder of MY PEACEFUL UNIVERSE an organisation that teaches MIndfulness and Meditation to Children. I am also a Mum of two divine Children aged 8 and 11.
I’m sure like many parents and families joining this Crowdfunding Campaign you are extremely concerned about the mental health and wellbeing of our beautiful children.
As we speak 1 in 7 children suffer from a mental health issue. That is over half a million Australian children in any given year alone. What is truly alarming, 50% of mental health issues are now emerging between the ages of 4 and 14!
So many parents are asking me, what can we do? How can we reverse these worrying trends?
 

My Story
Like a lot of children, I suffered low self-esteem and low self-image issues. In my early 20’s I was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa. This was a very difficult time for myself and my family and in my mid 30’s after having my 1st child, I began struggling with anxiety.
Discovering MEDITATION in my early 20’s really helped me manage a lot of my anxiety issues. But it was discovering MINDFULNESS that truly made a significant impact on my mental health and helped me become the mum that I am today.
Learn more about my story at mypeacefuluniverse.org
 
Why Mindfulness and Meditation?
Mindfulness and Meditation have now emerged as a fun and positive way to help children face a range of mental and emotional challenges in their young lives.
Research now shows that 8 weeks of Mindfulness and Meditation practice can help rewire our brains for happiness, and help cultivate joy in children.
Since starting my classes just this year I have been truly blessed to see first hand the positive effect Mindfulness and Meditation can have on a child's outlook on life.
In my classes, children learn how to still their minds and breath properly so they can manage sleep, stress and anxiety when it arises.
They also learn positive tools that help build confidence, resilience and self-awareness, as well as learn how to develop kindness and,  compassion towards themselves and others around them.

<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>The vision of Teach For Nigeria is that one day, all children will attain an excellent education. To achieve this vision, we are building a movement of leaders who will work to end educational inequity. Teach For Nigeria recruits Nigeria's most outstanding graduates, young professionals and existing teachers and places them as full time teachers in under-resourced schools for two years through the Fellowship program.</p>
<p>This year, 216 Fellows are impacting more than 13,000 children in 64 low-income schools across 3 states - in Lagos, Ogun and Kaduna State.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Nigeria’s population will double in thirty years, becoming the third most populous nation in the world. Imagine the future Nigeria could create by developing the potential of this coming generation.</p>
<p>Yet Nigeria’s educational infrastructure is not equipped to achieve this—Nigeria will need to leverage technology, develop more teachers and better curriculum, strengthen school leadership, improve child nutrition, and much more. <strong>This will require dynamic, and determined leadership of Nigerians addressing our challenges and innovating for the future.</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, our nation already has much of what it needs to thrive, a wealth of incredible talent!</p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>Teach For Nigeria recruits Nigeria's most outstanding graduates, young professionals and existing teachers and places them as full time teachers in under-resourced schools for two years. In the short run, these young leaders act as a source of dedicated teachers in government and low-income private schools. </p>
<h3>Long-Term Impact</h3>
<p>In the long run, Teach For Nigeria will build a powerful and ever-growing leadership force of alumni who, informed by their experiences and insights, will work from inside and outside the educational system to effect the fundamental, long-term changes necessary to ultimately realise educational opportunity for all. </p>

<h3>Fundraising Goal</h3>
<div><p>The next five years will be critical as we work to grow towards our target of placing over 1500 Fellows to serve nearly 500,000 of Nigeria’s poorest students by 2023.</p></div>
<p><strong>To expand and deepen our impact, Teach For Nigeria is raising funds to unlock a $50,000 grant.</strong></p>
<p>Now through April 30th, each donation is doubled (for instance, $50 becomes $100) due to this generous matching grant. Every single donation will make a difference and help us reach our campaign goal of $50,000.</p>

<h3>Rocket School - Summary</h3>
<p>I am a long time entrepreneur and researcher.  In the early 80's I was a guide on the Colorado River and I started a company to make an invention called Chums, a simple cotton eyeglass retainer.  I went on to build the company to 60 employees and we sold over 30 million Chums made in our own factory.  After about 5 years of making Chums. I began researching alternative energy concepts, built a machine shop and have learned a lot about various technologies.  I am  still involved in energy research and have been studying a rare formation of hydrogen for over 5 years. </p>
<p>I am also passionate about the maker movement and have visited over a dozen MakerSpaces around the US.  I was hired by Southern Utah University to help them get their new makerspace started.  </p>
<p>But, what I REALLY enjoy is passing forward my 4 decades of experience to young inventors and future scientists.   </p>
<p>The two ""Rocket School""  kits are well thought out and will include just about everything needed, except basic stuff like scissors, white glue and masking tape.  I will make a  good video which will teach the basics to the teacher/mentors so that the written instructions will be easier to follow.  </p>
<p>For me this is the start of something important.  I am passionate about STEM initiatives and it will be really fun to promote and grow Rocket School.   For example, there is a middle school in Brazil that designed a ""cube sat"", a micro satellite, and they got the Japanese Space Agency to carry it to orbit.  How incredible for those kids and how much they will learn!</p>
<p>Chums was well known for excellent customer service and I plan to make Rocket School just as great!  </p>
<p>Help spread the word and many more young people can learn rocketry, build a model and launch it. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am offering 2 kits plus an extra rockets package.  There are also 2 cool hats and a T-shirt you can buy to support the campaign.  Thanks! Mike</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> Getting young people more knowledgeable about rocketry and space exploration is the simple goal.  For many they will at least have a little background and hands on experience.  But, there always a few that get really excited about it an it may help shape their lives and career. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course with a rocket that reaches speeds of several hundred miles and hour a high degree of safety is very important.  I will assemble great videos that help the mentors learn all they need to know to run a safe program. </p>

Short Summary

We'll create a free online library for the healthcare workforce designed to promote emotional intelligence (EQ) and interpersonal skills!  There isn't much of this training in medical and nursing schools and the skills are essential for working together in teams and providing care that is heartfelt and safe!  

These alarming and pervasive problems can all be linked to difficulties with , ineffective communication, teamwork, & leadership!

Over 1100 preventable deaths in USA/per day associated with medical errors! 
Occupational injuries to the healthcare workforce that are 30x the rate of construction workers!
A destructive lack of respect that runs rampant in many facilities!

Learn more about how emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills are contributing to above problems and why improv is a perfect solution!






Just imagine:




Doctors and nurses listening!
Nurses, patients, and families speaking up!
The healthcare team working together extremely well!
Respect and compassion are in the air!
Care is heartfelt and safe (workplaces are too)!



The online Improvoscopy library will be full of resources designed to promote positive human interactions, (EQ in Phase I,  followed by, communication, teamwork, and leadership in Phases II-IV).  



Project backers will be helping to create A FREE website that all hospitals, nursing homes, clinics etc will have access to!  





When Phase I is complete,  doctors, nurses, administrative leaders everywhere will find lesson plans and teaching videos for 4-5 activities all geared towards building EQ!  (Links are to draft demos.)  




Improvoscopy: 
Serious Play for Safe Care! 





How will the money be spent?
In phase I, we'll get some healthcare professionals, improvisors, and trainers to become the Improvoscopy Players and gather for a full day of learning  improv activities that focus on building EQ. With some improv consulting input, I'll teach the group and have the process filmed. Once done,  I'll design lesson plans, and with help,  edit the film to bite-size learning moments.  We'll create and launch the website and 'VOILA' improvoscopy.com will be out there! 
Your contribution will help cover workshop development, filming, editing, participant' stipend and lunch, artwork, website development, executive assistance, perks, and miscellaneous administrative costs.  

Budget
Cost of Project:  $17,423
Cost of Fabulous Perks & shipping: $ 15,569
Total Cost:  $32,992
You'll find a detailed budget here.


Magnitude of Impact



The positive rippling effect of improved emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills will have a huge and positive impact on patient safety, patient experience, workforce safety, and career satisfaction.  
Also, because healthcare professionals care for and work with the entire spectrum of human diversity,  positive human behaviors could reach deep into our social fabric in immeasurable and healing ways.

We have a vision to give these great minds a chance to explore and learn, develop and compete with the challenging society we want to implement a new model of education while is more skill based, career development oriented as the need of time is.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The place </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Jaora a small town in India (Madhya Pradesh State), You would be in love with this place the moment you will be here. It is  full of natural beauty and beautiful people around. </span><br/></p>
<p> My dad has been a part of an educational NGO (Saraswati Shishu Mandir) for  12 year now, he and the team has build the school from scratch to over 1000+ student, over which nearly 40% students study with Scholarships or free. <br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>I had my primary education from Jaora, went out of station for secondary and higher education and now I am working in a multinational company as a Software Developer. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I have been an Educationalist since my college days, have taught more than 1000+ student during my college as a teacher in  three  different NGO's, I have also been conducting free career counselling session for helping student choose the correct career path.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The standard of teaching in Indian Engineering College's lacks the industry standard and requirements, after realizing this we </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">also started an Internship program to link college student to software companies. This helped student gain more practical knowledge gave them required skill set. We wish to provide the same standard of education to students in schools.</span></p>
<p> My Uncle, is a social activist, he started a NGO ""Atal Gram Vikas Samajik Sansthan""  in 2003 for educational development in villages. He is deeply attached with upliftment of villages in the area and has also been part of  ""Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan"" a pilot programme by Indian Government which aims at providing free primary education to children of  Indian villages with population of over 5000. We are a team of 40 social activist joining hands to fight the illiteracy. <br/><br/>It's time to take a big leap! </p>
<p>As you saw in the video still a big set of students are still uneducated and the no. is growing, we want to join our hands to the government efforts to ""Teach India"" and ""Skill India"" with this project, we want to upgrade our educational standard, sports facilities and give opportunity to explore the world to as many students as we can for free .

We have a vision to give these great minds a chance to explore and learn, develop and compete with the challenging society we want to implement a new model of education while is more skill based, career development oriented as the need of time is.
The place Jaora a small town in India (Madhya Pradesh State), You would be in love with this place the moment you will be here. It is  full of natural beauty and beautiful people around. 
 My dad has been a part of an educational NGO (Saraswati Shishu Mandir) for  12 year now, he and the team has build the school from scratch to over 1000+ student, over which nearly 40% students study with Scholarships or free. I had my primary education from Jaora, went out of station for secondary and higher education and now I am working in a multinational company as a Software Developer. 
I have been an Educationalist since my college days, have taught more than 1000+ student during my college as a teacher in  three  different NGO's, I have also been conducting free career counselling session for helping student choose the correct career path.
The standard of teaching in Indian Engineering College's lacks the industry standard and requirements, after realizing this we also started an Internship program to link college student to software companies. This helped student gain more practical knowledge gave them required skill set. We wish to provide the same standard of education to students in schools.
 My Uncle, is a social activist, he started a NGO ""Atal Gram Vikas Samajik Sansthan""  in 2003 for educational development in villages. He is deeply attached with upliftment of villages in the area and has also been part of  ""Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan"" a pilot programme by Indian Government which aims at providing free primary education to children of  Indian villages with population of over 5000. We are a team of 40 social activist joining hands to fight the illiteracy. It's time to take a big leap! 
As you saw in the video still a big set of students are still uneducated and the no. is growing, we want to join our hands to the government efforts to ""Teach India"" and ""Skill India"" with this project, we want to upgrade our educational standard, sports facilities and give opportunity to explore the world to as many students as we can for free . The reason we say Competitive is because 60% of youth from city has to go outstation for work, many of them fail to compete with the challenging society. We envision to provide student the best of class education, including smart classrooms, open school policies for developing skill, entrepreneur club, linking them to international/national societies, sports Facilities, Helping them explore their abilities and providing them  a chance to grow .Project Plan:

</h3>
I am very concerned about the lack of learning and studying
 skills I see in many kids.  Many teachers and parents teach knowledge 
but not the basic skills needed to learn and apply such knowledge.  
Students also struggle with the expression of their ideas in part 
because they do not know how to organize them in ways that others can 
follow easily.<br/><br/>I developed three writing lessons that are guaranteed to help students write better AND faster.  I have taught these lessons in workshops and private sessions but I can 
only reach a few students this way.  I want to share my ideas and impact
 more students.  Students are more likely to watch videos than read 
through a stack of paper.  Therefore, I'm raising funds to make videos 
of these lessons for 
them.  Funds will be used to make the 
videos, distribute them online for free, and buy advertisements to bring
 in more viewers.<br/><br/>There's one more lesson included in the package: <i>How to Study (and Take Notes)</i>.  It covers everything from  when-where-and-how study techniques and a note-taking system (yea, a whole system, not just some random techniques).  This lesson by itself is worth more than $5!  Or you can spend hours researching on the Internet and create the system on your own...<br/><br/><b>The four lessons are being ""sold"" as one perk that will help students write better and faster and study better, guaranteed!</b>  By using modern computer-based tools instead of just paper &amp; pen, one can categorize ideas, organize his thoughts, structure the writing properly, get more feedback from others, and improve the final product much more easily than ever before.<br/><br/>I believe critical learning skills should be made freely available to 
everyone.  I'm using the written curriculum to raise money to achieve 
that goal.  By buying what I offer here, you'll be benefiting many more 
students in the future while helping your kids today!<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>
</h3>
<h3>What I Need<br/>
</h3>I set a very small goal of $10,000 to be raised by selling my written curriculum for just US$5 each.  You, by buying the written curriculum, will help me buy time from my day-time job to work on the videos, pay for a small video lab at a local school so they can use my project to each kids video production, and help pay for online advertisements and social media campaigns.  The funding priorities are: video lab, my time, and online advertising.  We are also working on equipment donation for the video lab.<br/><p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What You Get<br/>
</h3>I think this curriculum would have such a great appeal to most parents that I can raise the funds I need by charging very little but encouraging everyone to spread the word.  But instead of waiting for the videos which may take time to design and produce, you will receive the written curriculum now and benefit your children today.  If your child does not want to read through them and practice, you may have to learn the techniques yourself and teach them.  But at least you'll have something in hand in exchange for the small contribution you make here.  If the video is not produced due to lack of funding, at least you are not left empty-handed.<br/><br/>Indiegogo requires that we offer you the items as ""perks"" and so this 4-part curriculum on writing is being ""sold"" for just $5.  I encourage you to get the curriculum and if you like what you see, come back and leave a comment (hopefully a favorable one), and spread the word.<br/><br/>I know this curriculum will help students with their writing, research, and speech preparations.  They may learn more skills such as critical thinking and analysis through these practices.  I promise you this will be the best $5 you will ever spent for your child.<br/><br/>Some of you may wish to contribute more than the minimum amount because you believe in what I do and want to be part of this effort.  I made a few perks that are purely for such contributions.  In exchange, you will be recognized in the videos and on the website that I will build.  I may throw in more education-related freebies.<br/><br/>If I don't get the money I need, I'll still figure out a way to make this happen because I care about this cause.  If I don't have money for advertising, it just means fewer students will find out about this.  That's why your supplemental contributions will be very helpful.<br/>
</div><div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>The best thing anyone can do for this project is to spread the word by e-mail or via various social media channels.  Even the best students can benefit from having more ideas to do things better and faster.<br/><br/>I also want to improve the curriculum.  Please send me your ideas.  I may not be able to answer your e-mails individually, but I will try to answer them by posting responses here.<br/><br/>I have other curricula that I wish to develop.  I just need time and money, and in my case money can actually buy time away from my work.  If you are interested in supporting my efforts, please contact me through the e-mail address you'll receive with any purchase and let's find ways to help our children.  Together we can make a difference in millions of lives.<br/><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>(Actually, these are questions that I think you may want to ask but may be too embarrassed to do so...)<br/><br/><b><i>How would I find out about the videos once they are ready?</i></b><br/><br/>I'll e-mail all backers and put the links on this page.  (Hmmm, that's one more reason to buy one of the perks here...)<br/><br/><b><i>Why should I pay for this written curriculum if you are going to produce videos?</i></b><br/><br/>Three simple reasons:<br/>1.  You get the lessons today and can teach your students now.  Depending on funding, it may take me a long time to get the videos made.  Is your child's success in school worth more than $5?<br/>2.  It's not everyday that you can be part of something so beneficial to so many for so little money.  For a contribution of $50 or above, you get your name mentioned in the video(s).<br/>3.  Unless you are on my mailing list by buying at least the $5 perk, how would I know to tell you when the videos are made?<br/><br/><b><i>Are these copyrighted materials?</i></b><br/><br/>Yes.  I applied for copyright in the US and was accepted.  I did not do this so I can sue violators.  Rather, I want to prevent someone from taking this material and limiting the distribution in the future.  I'm not in a position to fight such legal battles.  Thus I hope by applying for copyright up front, I can deter such schemers.<br/><br/><b><i>Can I give this curriculum to my friends?</i></b><br/><br/>You will be violating the copyright laws of the US.  I made the cost as low as I can and I have to wonder what is the motivation for giving this out in violation of the law when the cost is so low.<br/><br/>Also in my experience, most people do not treasure what they did not pay for.  If they actually paid $5 for this, they will be more likely to read and use it.<br/><br/><b><i>I'm a school teacher.  Can I use this in my class?</i></b><br/><br/>Yes.  As I said, no one should really own these critical learning skills.  Please teach them whatever you see suitable.<br/><br/><b><i>I'm a for-profit educational firm.  Can I use this in our classes?</i></b><br/><br/>Sure, but I think it's only fair if you donate some money to the cause.  You will also be mentioned in the videos as one of the supporters!  Consider your contribution advertising for your firm.<br/><b><br/><i>I don't agree with your philosophy, perspective, or techniques.  What can I do?</i></b><br/><br/>I welcome all comments and criticisms for it is through such feedback that I can learn and improve my curriculum.  Once you purchase any of the perks, you'll see my e-mail and can e-mail me in private.  I may not have time to answer your questions but be assured that I'll read them, eventually.<br/><br/>You can also leave comments on this site also, but please keep in mind that if your negative remarks are excessive, you may deter some students from getting these lessons and learn something valuable.  So please keep your differences of opinion as just that -- differences.  Let the other students judge for themselves.  Please don't try to sabotage this campaign just because we disagree on some of the points I make.<br/><br/><b><i>My kid doesn't want to read the material.  What can I do?</i></b><br/><br/>That's the exact reason why I want to produce the videos.  Now you know my frustration.  Even my own kid doesn't want to read my instructional materials.<br/><br/>As for you, I'd encourage that you go through the lessons, learn the tools and techniques, and work with him on one or two writing assignments.  Once he sees how this can really help him write better and faster, he will keep using it.  People are lazy, and will always accept ways to do less work to get the same or better results.  That's how we make progress.<br/><br/><b><i>I like what you do.  What else are you working on?  Can I be part of it?</i></b><br/><br/>First of all, I'm very honored that you read through this long webpage and are truly interested in this initiative.<br/><br/>If this campaign is successful, I may do this again for the other lessons.  The media lab I build will enable me to make more videos.  Please express your interest and we can discuss possibilities.  As of this writing, I haven't decided on what to do.  Let's just finish this campaign and see if this is a viable model of financing worthwhile projects.<br/><br/><br/>

<p><b>Slow Food NYC is dedicated to Good,
Clean, and Fair Food for All.</b>  We believe that everyone
has the right to ample, culturally meaningful, delicious food that is good for
human health and well-being, the planet, and those who labor to bring food to
our tables.  </p>
<p>We bring these values to<b> Urban Harvest Farm at Ujima, our t</b><b>uition-free, educational, urban farm in East New York, Brooklyn</b>. 
East New York suffers limited availability of fresh, wholesome food and
disproportionate incidences of diet-related disease - obesity and diabetes.  <b>Your
financial support of Urban Harvest at Ujima will</b><b> help us EXPAND and IMPROVE the educational experiences
we can provide to help meet these challenges.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>ABOUT URBAN HARVEST AT UJIMA</b></p>
<p>In 2010, Slow Food NYC turned an abandoned community
garden into a thriving educational urban farm - bringing a little more beauty, good
and clean food, and laughter and learning into the neighborhood. </p>
<p>Urban
Harvest at Ujima is a safe, secure place where children are provided with a
structured, five-day program of hands-on gardening experiences, age
appropriate food and farming focused lessons and activities, nutrition
education, and communal good food preparation and enjoyment... experiences that
help prepare them to make healthy choices, lead healthy lives, and act for the
health of their families and community. </p>
</div><div>
<p><b>WE HAVE BIG PLANS FOR UJIMA THIS
SUMMER AND YOU CAN HELP!</b></p>
<p>With the
support of community partners and supporters, like YOU, we will continue to
dedicate our time and passion to this important work because we believe that
learning about and experiencing Good, Clean, and Fair Food in a convivial
atmosphere has great impact on children.  </p>
<p>Building upon the success of 2015, our goal is to EXPAND and IMPROVE the
educational experiences we can provide at Ujima.  The funds raised through this campaign will
go towards:</p>
<p><span> 
- 
</span>Farming an additional, near-by lot
and erecting hoop houses to increase the amount of good, clean food we can grow
and bringing laying hens and honey bees to the farm;</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Expanding farm operation hours to
incorporate afternoon gardening opportunities for senior citizens (providing
inter-generational education opportunities for the children);</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Developing a “food box” program to
provide fresh vegetables and herbs (and flowers for the table) to each Student
and Senior Farmer each week;</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Conducting a weekly Student
Farmer-operated, community farm-stand.</p>
<p><b>Our plans are ambitious and will come to fruition with</b> <b>YOUR SUPPORT!</b></p>

GOOD FOOD EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN IN EAST NEW YORK, BROOKLYN


Slow Food NYC is dedicated to Good,
Clean, and Fair Food for All.  We believe that everyone
has the right to ample, culturally meaningful, delicious food that is good for
human health and well-being, the planet, and those who labor to bring food to
our tables.  
We bring these values to Urban Harvest Farm at Ujima, our tuition-free, educational, urban farm in East New York, Brooklyn. 
East New York suffers limited availability of fresh, wholesome food and
disproportionate incidences of diet-related disease - obesity and diabetes.  Your
financial support of Urban Harvest at Ujima will help us EXPAND and IMPROVE the educational experiences
we can provide to help meet these challenges.

ABOUT URBAN HARVEST AT UJIMA
In 2010, Slow Food NYC turned an abandoned community
garden into a thriving educational urban farm - bringing a little more beauty, good
and clean food, and laughter and learning into the neighborhood. 
Urban
Harvest at Ujima is a safe, secure place where children are provided with a
structured, five-day program of hands-on gardening experiences, age
appropriate food and farming focused lessons and activities, nutrition
education, and communal good food preparation and enjoyment... experiences that
help prepare them to make healthy choices, lead healthy lives, and act for the
health of their families and community. 

WE HAVE BIG PLANS FOR UJIMA THIS
SUMMER AND YOU CAN HELP!
With the
support of community partners and supporters, like YOU, we will continue to
dedicate our time and passion to this important work because we believe that
learning about and experiencing Good, Clean, and Fair Food in a convivial
atmosphere has great impact on children.  
Building upon the success of 2015, our goal is to EXPAND and IMPROVE the
educational experiences we can provide at Ujima.  The funds raised through this campaign will
go towards:
 
- 
Farming an additional, near-by lot
and erecting hoop houses to increase the amount of good, clean food we can grow
and bringing laying hens and honey bees to the farm;
- 
Expanding farm operation hours to
incorporate afternoon gardening opportunities for senior citizens (providing
inter-generational education opportunities for the children);
- 
Developing a “food box” program to
provide fresh vegetables and herbs (and flowers for the table) to each Student
and Senior Farmer each week;
- 
Conducting a weekly Student
Farmer-operated, community farm-stand.
Our plans are ambitious and will come to fruition with YOUR SUPPORT!

WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP
Slow Food NYC is run entirely, with love and dedication, by
volunteers and 100% of the funds raised for Urban Harvest at Ujima are used for
farm operation.  Here
is what your contributions can help accomplish:
 
- 
$25 can help
stock the cupboard with food preparation staples; 
 
- 
$150 can help buy a new pop-up tent to cover our “farm stand”; 
 
- 
$250 can build a
new hoop house to extend the growing season or a new chicken coop for laying
hens;
 
- 
$500 can
compensate a neighborhood high school youth to work as a Student Farmer Peer Mentor
for a month, during July or August; 
 
- 
$1,000 can help provide Student Farmers with lunch, prepared with fresh,
seasonal, local, ingredients, for a month during July or August;
 
- 
$1,200 can help build new raised planting beds at a new farm site.

The Impact 
During the summer of 2015, Student
Farmers:
 
- 
Planted and tended 60 varieties of vegetables, herbs, and flowers; 
 
- 
Harvested about 150
pounds of herbs, salad and cooking greens, and other vegetables;
 
- 
Prepared lunch together every day,
incorporating fresh food from the farm (about
2,000 snacks and lunches, largely plant-based, were prepared and enjoyed);
 
- 
Composted about

In addition to providing social and mental support, we've customized our program to meet STEM education guidelines, and have integrated additional subject areas such as literature, art, and philosophy.We believe that educational robotics is a powerful tool that can help students of diverse backgrounds learn how to work together, and also bring their families close together through collaboration and empathy.Check out our work : Find us on Facebook:  http://facebook.com/Innovast-Technology/postsOur goalOur goal is to raise $68,000. When you sponsor a child for $23, it provides the following:
Transportation for students from home to the center
Robotic Trainers to work with students
Psychological evaluations to ensure a safe learning environment
Supplies (from paper to desks)
Laptops
Robot's kits
Training mats
With your help, we hope to build a strong, optimistic generation and a bright, secure future for many kids.The Impact
The very first impact is the logical thinking gained from the programming skill that the children will learn
Mechanical aspects that will make the children's imagination vision come true in physical shapes
Teamwork and collaboration skills through ""group work division"" way and tasks distribution
Closing the educational gaps by providing a scientific experiment compatible with formal curriculum
Psycho-social support
Our children have the right to learn ""Everyone has the right to an education"" #Innovast_children  Former Projects and Reports:Syria’s Hope Project:In cooperation with  Physicians Across Continents we started Syria's hope project, It focuses on the group affected most by the war in Syria, the orphans in particular and the refugees in general. By introducing Robotic Technology in the form of classes in school.Project Goals:Encourage the kids to learn science by using Robot Technology in the form of scientific experiments. Provide social behavior and scientific assessment.Provide psycho-social support and boost the children’s self confidence.Strengthen the children’s mechanical, programming and visual skills as well as their recitation skill.First Stage:June 2015 - 125 orphans - 7 hours (English subtitle included)

By working closely with the parents, we will help transport them to and from class. Other Ways You Can HelpCan't contribute? sure you can! please make some noise about Robot Cafe and share it with your friends and family using the Indiegogo share tools.together we achieve more.Spread the love, spread the robots  .^_^.Who are we:Innovast Technologyhttps://www.facebook.com/Innovast.TechnologyThe company implementing the project.Strategic partners:Refugee Open Ware (www.row3d.org)Supports the use of advanced technology for helping refugeesNextFab (www.nextfab.com)Provides technical and educational support.Partners:Rahma Relief Foundationhttps://www.facebook.com/pg/RAHMA.RELIEF.FOUNDA...The sponsor of the first stage of the project that included 60 children for 2 months.assisting parties:The Educational and Cultural CenterOne of the projects of Homs League Abroad and one of the hosts of Robot Cafe.https://www.facebook.com/homsleague/?pnref=storyKareem HomeThe orphans are participants in the project.Pixle Art4PrintSupplier of printing services.https://www.facebook.com/Arak.print2/?pnref=lhcTeam: Mahmoud Al ShakfehFounder and Executive Director of Innovast TechnologyFounding Member and a member of the Board of Directors at Zaid Ibn Thabit Foundation - volunteerFounder and Director of ngo syria - http://ngosyria.org/ - volunteerA Contributor to Development Activities and Education.Judge of teamwork at The Robotic Championship, Syria.Founder and Board Member at SDI, Turkey - volunteerFormer Development Director at Brightsoft, SyriaFormer Development Manager at Bawabaty.netLamia Gorra:Bachelor in EconomicsTech with confidence - certified from queen Rania universitychildren Psychological Health - certified from queen Rania universityTRT trainer at children and war foundation

هدفنا:
نسعى للوصول إلى 500 طفل لتعليمهم لمدة ست أشهر. بكلفة 23 دولار شهريا للطفل الواحد نحتاج إلى 68,000 دولار ستستخدم لـ:

مركز مجهز للتدريب لمدة 6 أشهر فعلية.
مواصلات من وإلى المركز.
فريق من المدربين المحترفين لتدريب الأطفال ( 3 فرق، 3 أشخاص بكل فريق)
تجهيزات ( قرطاسية، طاولات، وأدوات أخرى...)
أجهزة كمبيوتر
 مجموعات الروبوتات EV3 مع مجموعات الإضافات
 رقعات تدريب

بجهودكم نستطيع بناء جيل قوي، متفائل ومشرق، بمستقبل آمن للكثير من الأطفال.
حملتنا مرنة الهدف، نحصل على دعم أكثر ندرب أطفالاً أكثر والعكس بالعكس.يمكنكم مساعدتنا بالتبرع بأي مبلغ تريدونه أو عن طريق اختيار أحد الميزات الموجودة على اليمين ذات المبالغ المحددة
الأثر:

الأثر الأول هو التفكير المنطقي الذي سيكتسبه الأطفال من خلال مهارة البرمجة المعطاة.
المفهوم الميكانيكي الذي يجعل خيال الأطفال النظري يطبق أمامهم من خلال الأشكال التي سيبنوها.
مهارة العمل الجماعي ""العمل ضمن مجموعات"" ومهارة توزيع المهام.
ترميم الثغرة التعليمية من خلال توفير تجارب علمية متناسبة مع المنهاج المدرسي.
دعم نفسي اجتماعي.

مشاريع وتقارير سابقة:
 مشروع أمل سوريا :
بالتعاون مع اطباء عبر القارات بدأنا مشروع أمل سوريا، يركز المشروع على الفئة الأكثر تضررا من الآثار السلبية للحرب في سوريا و هم الأيتام خاصة و اللاجئين عامة  و ذلك من خلال إدخال تقنية الروبوتيك على شكل حصص درسية في مدارسهم 
أهداف المشروع :

دعم الأطفال علميا حيث دخلت تقنية الروبوتيك على شكل تجارب علمية مناسبة لعمرهم الدراسي
توفير تقييم سلوكي اجتماعي و تقييم علمي للأطفال
توفير دعم نفسي اجتماعي و تعزيز ثقة الأطفال بنفسهم
تعزيز المهارات الميكانيكية و البرمجية و البصرية بالاضافة لمهارة الالقاء لدى الأطفال

المرحلة الأولى: شهر حزيران 2015 - 128 طفل يتيم - 7 ساعات 

المرحلة الثانية:العام الدراسي لسنة 2015 / 2016 - 300 طفل - 24 ساعةقناة الآن:

<p>Financial planning as it currently stands is expensive and is quite a long, drawn out process. The cost and complexity of advice inhibits the majority of the 99% from being able to obtain it with upfront costs starting at $1,500 - $10,000+ for the right advisers. The advisers most of you can access also often push products with hidden commissions.</p>

<h3>What is the fundraising about?</h3>
<p>Ralph Dunex Gustave is raising 15,000.00 USD to cover the tuition of his 14 weeks Bootcamp at Coding Dojo for the coming cohort of June 19, 2017. The cost of the program is $11995. However, the $3000 extra are to cover his bills and expenses for the period due to the high concentration time needed in order to succeed in the Bootcamp. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Who is Ralph Dunex Gustave?</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Born in Camp-Perrin, Haiti on January 2, 1993, Ralph is a young motivated full-time student at West Los Angeles College since January 2016. With a current 3.5 GPA, Ralph has first used a computer at the age of 15, so late compared to the average US youth but enough for him to know 5 years later how to build websites with Wordpress or even learn the basic of programming in Python by watching Youtube videos. </span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483085448/a1mgebheanx5iboyiskg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>Image of me on my way to work in the field in 2013</i></p>
<p>Ralph is devoted to his education and wants to be one of the best computer engineers in Haiti. As a true patriot, he wants to devote his life and knowledge in order to help Haiti get out of its poor economic status. Lately, Ralph is a hard worker that has worked hard back in Haiti to pay for his trip and education in the US. For the last 3 years, Ralph worked on his family lands and saved roughly $20000 to come pursuing his dream in the US. Ralph is <strong>quadrilingual</strong> as he currently speaks <u>Creole, French, English and Spanish</u>.</p>
<p>Ralph is very passionate about technology, most importantly about the internet. He currently has a <a href=""http://www.pawolmizik.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> about Haitian music that is visited by more that 300 people daily. </p>

<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Why a coding Bootcamp over a college degree?</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>Before I answer the question, let me explain what to everyone what a coding Bootcamp is. A coding Bootcamp is a technical training program that teaches the parts of programming with the biggest impact and relevance to current market needs. ... Most coding Bootcamps last anywhere from 8-12 weeks and are designed for speed and high-impact learning.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Now let's turn back to the initial question that will explain my interests in the program. This aspect of my fundraising campaign can be explained in two detail parts. The first one is linked to my financial situation. As mentioned above, I am here in the country on the savings that I made from my previous work in my country. It comes out that I am running out of money so now I have to rely on some family members to support me. As a matter of fact, I realized that I will not be able to continue taking classes which will result in my expulsion from the school then the loss of my student visa. On the other hand, for the purpose of my professional goal and career. I find a Bootcamp best suited for my needs as it provides a quick gain of skills that can be applied directly towards my life dream of having a tech company.</span></p>
<p>Most importantly, one should understand that I am not leaving college. I am going to pursue my computer science degree until I earn my Associate of Science. However because I am not transferring to a 4-year institution, I will be doing the Coding Bootcamp for the summer of 2017 to fill the other 2 years of college.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Please make a donation of at least 5$ to help me avoid being out of school and lost my visa. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>What's next after the Bootcamp?</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>After attending my 14 weeks Bootcamp at coding dojo, I will be applying for an OPT which is a Training program that allows International students to work in the US after having a degree. Although the Bootcamp alone can't count for the OPT, I will be graduating from West LA College after Spring 2018. From another point of view, I am an International student who comes here in the US to study. Which means that my main focus is what I am learning and not the job outcomes. In all the situations, I will win. </p>
<p>The most probable outcome is that I will go back to my country to build my company.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why should this matter to you?</h3>
<p>My fundraising should matter to anyone fighting for the cause of minority students as I am clearly one of them. As an African descent, I am limited to many opportunities. Considering the family and country that I was born in, I have come a long way and now I require a little support. I consider myself as a help seeker, begging and willing to do anything possible for my education because I believe this is the only one way one can be useful to his society. Please contribute with a minimum of 5$ to help me accomplish that valuable goal.</p>
<p>Without your support, I will not make it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>My business model</h3>
<p>The main motivation around my studies is to gain enough skill to build a tech company in Haiti. The main services of the company are the following:<br/>1. Sell bus tickets online for all the major bus carriers operating through the country. Including a service of a personal guide that tourists visiting Haiti can book online to help them navigate the country. <br/>2. Offer an online platform for Haitian parents living in the US to pay for the school tuition of their children and relatives left in Haiti or even buy books and school uniforms.<br/>3. Offer an online platform for people living in Haiti's main cities to buy their groceries from inner cities and have them delivered to their home.<br/>4. Offer an online service where Haitians living in Haiti can buy goods directly from the US.</p>
<p><br/>Any significant contribution to my study can be rewarded as shares of the company.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other ways you can help</h2>
<p>If you want to help me but you currently don't have the money to do so you can still contribute. I am currently accepting any used thing that is worth 5$ or more. Here's how it works:</p>
<p>1. I will come to your place* and pick up anything that you are willing to give (used clothes, shoes, bags, non-working phone including computers and laptops, or anything of value that I can sell for 5$ or more)<br/>2. I will ship the collected items to Haiti so my family can sell them for me.<br/>3. The money from the selling will go directly to the fundraising campaign.</p>

<h3>AN INITIATIVE  FOR BETTERMENT OF ELDER GENERATION.</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Nepal is a country where senior citizen care is in great need of reform. Like many places, citizens of Nepal traditionally care for their elderly family members. But with the state of the economy, so many people leave the country for work and to make new lives.</p>
<h4>So you can help this project to establish 1 non profit facility<br/>dedicated to caring for the elderly.</h4>

<p>We believe that older adults deserve a life of dignity and access to
appropriate care suited to their needs for healthy ageing. Although care and well-being
of its seniors should be a core priority of a civilized nation-state, Nepal
remains an unfortunate exception. Nepal as a nation-state has an extremely weak
health and social welfare system in general, and the well-being of the elderly
in particular remains largely neglected. Senior citizens have however
contributed greatly to the social and economic development and cultural fabric
of their societies and the nation as a whole, and it becomes the current
generation’s ethical responsibility to respond to their needs.  </p>

<p>In
Nepal, government-funded social safety nets for the elderly are virtually
non-existent, and most traditional community-funded old age homes are in
immense disrepair and suffer from lack of basic geriatric health and sanitation
services.  Due to a lack of employment opportunities in Nepal,
a majority of the younger population is forced to migrate to countries in the
Middle East, Southeast Asia, Europe, United States or Australia in search of
jobs.  As a result, the traditional
support and care received by older adults from their younger family members has
quickly declined, and in many cases, older adults are dangerously living by
themselves despite major illnesses and disabilities. In addition, there are increasing cases of older adults suffering from
curable illnesses and manageable conditions due to lack of access to basic
health maintenance and preventive care needed for healthy aging. </p>

<p>In addition to the

also a major gap in available funding in the non-governmental sector for the
development of health and social services for the elderly in Nepal. Most
donor-funded local organizations as well as international organizations seem to
focus their efforts on child welfare and other areas of health, social and
educational development in Nepal. While these efforts are commendable in their
own right, the need for developing health and social services for the unique
needs of senior citizens remains largely ignored and severely underfunded.  There are thus ample unfulfilled opportunities
to improve the quality of life of older adults in Nepal.  Interested donors are urged to recognize this
unmet need for funding, and support local efforts aimed at uplifting the life

The Telecoms Centres will also act as temporary classrooms during the day and give the families accommodation at night. We have teachers that are prepared to give lessons via the internet to the children, why should these children suffer in having an education we wouldn't allow it to happen to our own children.We all saw the horrifying pictures on the news on the 15th September on the tragic death of the 3 year old boy in Turkey. I cannot imagine how it feels swimming in cold water with your baby in your arms just to reach a place that you are safe. We are the lucky ones we never have to experience that these families do this on a daily basis.That's where you and i come in. If you would like to help us help these refugee families by donating even just a few $'s or £'s .We would be immensely appreciative.Any donation that you are willing to provide, no matter how small, will go directly towards helping these families start living the life they deserve- free of terror and full of possibility. Every $ or £ that you donate will help us build the Telecoms Centre.Your donation will allow us to purchase the following items and allow these families to keep in contact with their families and loved ones and give them the education they deserve.SIM Cards with credit  to make these important calls to let there families and loved ones know that they are alive and well.Tri Band mobiles so they can make these important calls.Tents to be used for the Telecoms Centre and teaching area during the day then used as additional accommodation during the night.Solar/ Battery chargers for the mobiles after all they don't have electricity.Solar Generators to power the mobiles and other equipment to be used for the calls and teaching and education purposes.Laptops and the software to give the children a good start in life and understand the modern world. This will help them prepare for the future after all we all deserve a standard way of life we are no different we are all the same.So please help us with this campaign share this message with your friends, family and even your loved ones that's what we are trying to achieve for these refugees after all.With your small donation and you spreading this message we can give these families and these children a good start in life. The most important thing to remember is we cannot change the world overnight but we can make a big difference if we stand together and contribute.Many Thanks!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div><h3>What Is The Firestarter Project?</h3></div>
<div>When you think of fire, what comes to mind? Passion, energy, heat. A catalyst for change. The Firestarter project is about creating change, lighting the sparks across the world and letting the fires of our hearts and minds begin to burn. </div>
<div>As young people, we have each been a part of different learning experiences, and our varied paths have given each of us perspectives into what it means to be, and how to become, an empowered young adult. We believe that every student should have the chance to find his or her own avenue to empowerment, and we want to make different opportunities accessible to youths from all backgrounds, opening up opportunities where before there had seemingly only been one acceptable path.</div>
<div>Together, we brainstormed what it takes to empower young adults, and found a few key elements: community, respect, individualized learning, creativity, and a safe place to try, fail, and try again. With these facets in mind, we set out to create a project that offers that space for young adults and begins their learning journey.</div>
<h4>The Firestarter Project is comprised of three parts:</h4>
<div><ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Forming a network of organizations with the similar purpose of supporting emerging adults</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Visiting high schools to connect with students moving on to the next stage in their lives</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Hosting a summit in June 2016 to provide an accessible and engaging experience that inspires and spreads the message that you can create the change you seek, and that you aren't alone in that</span><br/>

De Draper University is een ondernemingscursus opgericht door Silicon Valley investeerder Tim Draper. In deze intensieve vijf weekse cursus leer je alles wat te maken heeft met ondernemen, zoals leiderschap, financiën, productontwikkeling, creativiteit, etc. Alle lessen worden gegeven door Tim Draper zelf en veel andere Silicon Valley ondernemers van bedrijven als Tesla, Google en Apple. Op deze cursus wil ik me omgeven met andere jonge ondernemers van over de hele wereld om van hun te kunnen leren en om misschien wel mijn toekomstige business partner te vinden. Ik weet zeker dat dit een unieke, leerzame ervaring wordt.Ik ben erg trots op dat ik aangenomen ben, omdat dit betekent dat zij er in geloven dat ik in staat ben een succesvol bedrijf op te richten. Daarom ben ik ook enorm gemotiveerd om zo veel mogelijk te leren en om op een wereld verbeterd idee te komen. Mijn doel is om $12000 (€9600) te verzamelen om het volledige collegegeld te betalen. Dit collegegeld houdt het volgende in:
Accomodatie
Vervoer naar andere bedrijven en San Fransisco
Alle gastsprekers
Outdoor activiteiten
Deze studie betekent heel veel voor mij. Het zal mijn eerste echte stap naar ondernemerschap zijn. De studie begint in augustus 2018 en het collegegeld moet dan ook betaald zijn. Help mij alsjeblieft met het betalen van dit collegegeld door een donatie te doen. Elke donatie is erg nuttig en ik ben erg dankbaar voor elke donatie. Ondertussen is de campagne helaas al afgelopen, maar als je nog steeds wilt doneren kan dat, door het gewenste bedrag over te maken naar NL84 INGB 0660 7340 87. Als je geen donatie wilt doen, maar alsnog wilt helpen kun je ook mijn crowdfund delen. Dit zal mijn ook erg helpen.Dankjewel.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Our Community Outreach Program is designed to give Underprivileged Youth ages 12-18 in the Denver area an opportunity to <b>LEARN </b>and <b>TRAIN </b>with MOTH.  Selected students will join our growing community of like minded kids, while developing the skills necessary to pursue a career in the circus arts.  Students will focus on developing artistry along with the physical skills necessary to <b>CREATE</b> original acts, while learning to <b>PERFORM</b> as an ensemble along side the adult professional training students and elite professionals. </p>
<p>Year to Date, MOTH has raised just over $11,000 so far and is 22% funded.  Our 2016 fund raising goal is $50,000.  We are so grateful for the support our community has shown, and we are thrilled to make this program a reality. The funding will go directly to providing free tuition for underprivileged youth to join our professional training programs, help buy new equipment, and bring in world-class coaches. If we receive 100% funding, we will also be able to send out coaches into the Denver Public School system to teach and reach a greater number of children.</p>
<p>MOTH Contemporary Circus Center, the home of MOTH Poetic Circus, is located in the RiNo Art District in downtown Denver. MOTH Contemporary Circus Center is the premier training facility in Denver, Colorado for professionally minded circus artists, and is based on the philosophy of our four pillars, LEARN, TRAIN, CREATE and PERFORM.

Output would include a printed book, an e-book, a multimedia book with augmented reality features, a CD/DVD, and more.  
 In return you will receive a wide variety of perks as our ""Thank you"". Look at the list of our amazing perks. 

Even modest donations go a long way to ensure ta'sheeq is sustainable and offers a wide variety of Syrian artists opportunity to particpate. 


    Risks & Challenges  Getting people excited about poetry is tough nowadays. We realize that!
We hope that the experiential aspect of our project will mitigate this.

The multi-sensory environment we create, will invite people to experience poetry.    Other Ways You Can Help If you can not back the project by money, that's absolutely fine, we understand. You can support by:  Spreading the word about our project. 
Share with your friends and family, and colleagues who might be interested. 
Share on Facebook, twitter, and other social media platforms.    And that's all there is to it.Collaborating Artists (names in no particular order):Poets

I'm Jennifer Gilhool and I've spent more than 25 years swinging from place to place on the corporate jungle gym on my way to serving as a the first-ever director for the sustainability and regulatory function in Asia Pacific & Africa for a Fortune 50 company. I get it.

I call myself a recovering anxiety-ridden workaholic. I wrote a book about my experience navigating the corporate jungle gym in Shanghai, China with my family -- a real life lean-in story -- called Sheryl Sandberg, China & Me. And, that book led me to think bigger.
If I burned out on my way to the coveted position of corporate officer, who wouldn't? There must be a better way. And, there is. It starts by creating a better, more diverse, and authentically inclusive work culture. It doesn't stop there, however, Culture must be nurtured, measured, and adjusted to meet the needs of a changing world.

Our world is changing fast. Today, Millennials are the dominant generation in the workforce and they don't work in the same way as the formerly dominant Baby Boom generation.

Accessible -- available live and on-demand in digestible pieces that easily fit into your coffee break
Actionable -- strategies, tactics, workbooks, checklists along with tips and conversation rituals that you can put into practice immediately
Authentic -- we take the latest research and turn it into actionable solutions that work for you. We know because we've navigated the dominant culture and as member of the non-dominant culture too

Our user community will have access to virtual coaching, interviews, live and on-demand webinars, and more. Most of our content is designed to be viewed in under 15 minutes -- over a cup of coffee -- and immediately actionable. And, you can always get more information if you want it because we provide links and downloads of the research supporting our programming. If you still want more information, you can send us your questions.

We need your help to bring our content to life.
We have dozens of videos in the vault waiting to be edited and uploaded. We've tackled the most talked about and the most relevant topics first;


Unconscious bias, 
Performance assessment and talent management bias
Personal leadership and career planning
Professional leadership development
The art of difficult conversations, and more.  

Our programming isn't passive - it's compelling, engaging, and interactive. Through polling questions, we monitor developing trends in the workplace and develop our programming based on our user community's needs, keeping our content relevant and relatable. During scheduled webinars, our user community can communicate not only with the host but with each other through Twitter and other tools.
Today's workforce craves development. And, with the changing demographics of work and the failure of conventional diversity compliance training to develop cultural awareness and cultural management skills, a new approach is needed. GEL's interactive learning lab makes understanding the diverse experiences of the workforce accessible to virtually every member of the workforce. Our training modules are specifically designed to help our user community connect with the ""characters"" in our series and experience the workplace through the eyes of their diverse colleagues. Seeing and feeling the experience is far more powerful than reading a corporate diversity study or sitting through compliance-based training.



Watch a beta video today! And, help us populate the learning lab with more. 

We've gone as far as we can our own. Now, we need your help to complete the editing and post-production on nearly thirty (30) pre-recorded virtual coaching sessions and to hire staff to work with our platform provider and deliver the final product to you. We have our first training series scripted. Your donations will help us hire the film crew, create the supporting content, and complete the post-production work to offer this revolutionary cultural awareness and diversity training to our user community.
Our Content Sets Us Apart! Don't Take Our Word For It, Listen to What Our Pilot Partners Have to Say!

You don't have to take our word, listen to what members of the MBA Class of 2016 from the  University of Michigan's Stephen M. Ross School of Business have to say about participating in our pilot program on creating gender equity allies at and beyond business school. 
No matter what level you choose to donate, your donation brings to life the most affordable career development and coaching program available on the market. With our ability to create interactive programming, capture live events and replay play them on-demand, we are revolutionizing the way we talk about and approach diversity in virtually any setting fro universities to corporations to government agencies.  
Executive coaching costs as much as 10% of a C-Suite executives salary, For a C-Suite executive earning just $250,000 annually, the cost is $25,000 for a single coach for a year. Our interactive learning lab allows us to provide diversity and career coaching for a fraction of that cost. Every dollar you invest in developing your diversity, management, and leadership skills, is an investment in yourself, your earnings future, and your growth potential.
