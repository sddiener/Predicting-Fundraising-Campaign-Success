<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Malice and Mario Sweet. We are a married couple from Seattle, Washington who share our love for each other and others through music. You may have heard of us or seen us perform with our band The Physics. You also may have heard our first studio album called Happy 2 Year. We are truly humbled by the success of our first album and we never imagined that a project we started in our living room could get airplay across the globe! </p>
<p>We are very anxious to drop a new studio album and have been working for over a year on our new project. We are calling it Enjoy:Like:Love. In essence, it is an elaboration of Happy 2 Year, but it will take you on a more intricate musical journey. We are calling it Enjoy:Like:Love because we believe you are going to <em>Enjoy</em> this album for it's positivity and soulful melodies. We also believe you are going to <em>Like</em> this album, possibly enough to share it with a loved one or a friend. But we strive to make you <em>Love</em> this album because it was made out of love for the lover in all of us. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We believe that our financial goal of $3000 will sufficiently fund the project.</p>
<p>We also believe that 45 days is the appropriate amount of time to raise these funds.</p>
<p>Every dollar contributed to this campaign will go to financing studio sessions, and the mixing and mastering of the album.</p>
<p>$3000 is all that is standing in between us releasing this album to the world.</p>
<p>We also believe that the awesome folks that contribute to this campaign should get something in return so they know how much we appreciate their support! </p>
<p>Every single person who contributes to our campaign will receive an incentive: anything from free music downloads, an invite to our exclusive album release party, an original chorus from us, and many other additional incentives.</p>
<p>Although we have faith that we will reach our goal- we will not be deterred if this goal is not fully attained. We are releasing this album no matter what!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We never imagined that people would gravitate to our music the way they have thus far. We think we have something special which is why it would mean the world to us to complete this album in 2013. 2013 is not only going to be a special year for music,  but we are also expecting a baby in July! We would be soo proud to be able to not only share new music but new life with the world! Come be a part of our journey!</p>

The song was then recorded with the generous help of Benjamin Hotchkiss and Kyle Crusham at Tequila Mockingbird.<br/><br/><img alt=""The Esme Barrera Fan Club Performing 'She's A Rainbow' at the Memorial"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7143/6738078223_b2af22d41a.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Esme Barrera Fan Club Performing 'She's A Rainbow' at the Memorial""/><br/></span></p>
<p>A year and a half later, Esme's friends, coworkers, family, students, and campers still feel her loss--but her colorful energy continues to radiate throughout the community. The recording of “She’s a Rainbow” captures Esme’s beautiful spirit and helps it live on for the world to experience through Esme’s favorite medium - records! Specifically, red vinyl 45s! Digital downloads are also available for the turntable deprived.</p>
<p><strong>Your donation will help fund the production of “She’s a Rainbow” 7"" records and jackets, performed by the Esme Barerra Fan Club, and fund scholarships</strong> for girls to participate in Girls Rock Austin music programs.</p>
<p>Esme inspired people far and wide, and many others have written about her. Read Summer Anne Burton’s moving tribute “The year without Esme” on <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/summeranne/the-year-without-esme"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Buzzfeed.</a> The <a href=""http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2012-01-13/excited-about-life/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Austin Chronicle</a> and the <a href=""http://www.austin360.com/news/entertainment/music/remembering-esme-barrera-2/nRjZ5/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Austin American Statesman</a> also wrote eloquently about Esme.</p>
<p>We’re excited to offer this as a community project - and we want you to join us and help us get the record out.

The Impact You'll Have

Esme was passionate about Girls Rock Austin, and we strive to keep her name and memory alive by providing a safe space for girls from all backgrounds to develop their own musical and personal voices. This scholarship helps bring kids to camp, many of whom wouldn't otherwise be able to afford to come. Our programs provide music instruction, a variety of workshops, and performances by local bands in a positive, all-female environment.

<p>Scottish singer, songwriter and translator <strong>Tommy Beavitt</strong> will record the album ‘Voices from Russia’ with prominent Scottish folk musicians including <strong>Toby Shippey</strong> (Salsa Celtica, Whisky River Band) <strong>John Somerville </strong>and <strong>Adam Sutherland</strong> (Treacherous Orchestra, Babelfish).</p>
<p>This album will be the culmination of 5 years of creative work involving Scottish singer, songwriter and translator Tommy Beavitt, Russian poets and translators including <strong>Boris Petrov</strong>, <strong>Misha Feygin</strong>, <strong>Alexander Zyryanov</strong>, <strong>Vadim Astrakhan</strong> and <strong>Irina Golovina</strong> as well as painters <strong>John Mikietyn</strong>, <strong>Vicky Stonebridge</strong>, <strong>Frank McNab</strong> and <strong>Andrey Eletsky</strong>.</p>
<p>The collaborations continue to take place under the auspices of the <strong>Global Village Bards</strong> (Scotland, international) project working together with other organisations such as the <strong>Ural-Scottish Society</strong> (Ekaterinburg) and <strong>Veresk </strong>(Moscow).</p>
<p>Starting from the coincidence of the joint birthdays of bards <strong>Robbie Burns</strong> and <strong>Vladimir Vysotsky</strong> on 25th January, this project has produced new <strong>translations of Burns into Russian</strong>, new <strong>translations of Vysotsky into English</strong> and a significant number of <strong>completely new songs</strong>, many of them based around paintings by the visual artists involved.</p>

<li>The voice of the rebellious lone wolf in Vysotsky's classic 1968 Soviet protest song Охота на волков is blended with that of his gentrified persecutors by Beavitt – who was born in that same year of global revolution – to create a red-hot political invective for a post-crisis global capitalist world under the title 'Who'll come a hunting for the wolf'</li>

<p>While some songs will appear only in one language (i.e. Vysotsky songs will only be recorded in English translated form and Burns' songs will only be performed in the new translated Russian versions), many of the new songs on this album will appear in both Russian and English versions.

</ul></div>","Voices from Russia
Scottish singer, songwriter and translator Tommy Beavitt will record the album ‘Voices from Russia’ with prominent Scottish folk musicians including Toby Shippey (Salsa Celtica, Whisky River Band) John Somerville and Adam Sutherland (Treacherous Orchestra, Babelfish).
This album will be the culmination of 5 years of creative work involving Scottish singer, songwriter and translator Tommy Beavitt, Russian poets and translators including Boris Petrov, Misha Feygin, Alexander Zyryanov, Vadim Astrakhan and Irina Golovina as well as painters John Mikietyn, Vicky Stonebridge, Frank McNab and Andrey Eletsky.
The collaborations continue to take place under the auspices of the Global Village Bards (Scotland, international) project working together with other organisations such as the Ural-Scottish Society (Ekaterinburg) and Veresk (Moscow).
Starting from the coincidence of the joint birthdays of bards Robbie Burns and Vladimir Vysotsky on 25th January, this project has produced new translations of Burns into Russian, new translations of Vysotsky into English and a significant number of completely new songs, many of them based around paintings by the visual artists involved.
The key idea behind the project is that VOICES, if authentically developed, can transmit across national, cultural and even linguistic barriers.
Thus:

'Stranger in Paradise', written by Tommy Beavitt in his early 20s after reading the Russian novel 'Master and Margarita', is given a new dimension in Misha Feygin's masterful translation Чужой в рай
Vladimir Vysotsky's transposition of mediaeval English archers' urge to throw off the chains of their thraldom into the late Soviet Russian context is re-adapted into the conditions of  Anglophone late capitalism in Beavitt's collaboration with New York-based Vadim Astrakhan 
Георгий Победоносец, Boris Petrov's Eurasian paean to St. George becomes an invocation of England's patron saint at a time of need in Beavitt's translation 'St. George, Arise!'; with the addition of a female chorus, an international peace anthem
The lusty voices of British privateers are artfully captured from Frank McNab's painting by Professor Alexander Ziryanov's Russian poem Кариатида and then retransformed back into British English in Beavitt's translation and song 'Caryatida (floozy on a ship)'

The voice associated with the figure of St. Andrew, patron of both Scotland and Russia, is channeled by Petrov from a painting by Andrey Eletsky into the poem Андрей Первозванный and into the Scottish independence anthem 'On the Saltire Cross' by Beavitt
The voice of the Russian soldier who misses his fallen in action comrade in Vysotsky’s Он не вернулся из боя is transposed into any number of possible contexts (e.g. Afghanistan etc.) in Beavitt’s collaborative translation with Misha Feygin ‘He hasn’t returned from the battle’.
The voice of the internationalised emigrant Scot, known the world over from the Burns song 'Auld Lang Syne', bubbles up with renewed vigour into Zyryanov's poem В кругу друзей and on into Beavitt's song 'Old comrades circle'

By allowing listeners to compare the same voice accompanied by the same music – but in different languages – this is potentially a great way to facilitate language learning and cultural appreciation – in both directions!

We need to pay for accommodation, food, drink and a sound engineer for a week
Like any other professionals, musicians need to be paid! This is not just a moral consideration but also a practical one – without a budget, this project will not happen when we need it to happen!
The result of the project will be high quality recordings that may go on to form a concrete, valuable and lasting relationship between Russia and Scotland! By supporting this project, you will be part of that relationship!
You will also receive high quality digital copies of the musical recordings produced and an e-booklet describing the project, the places and the artists involved, texts and images and the names, logos etc. of all sponsors
The twin albums will only be released, in Scotland, Russia and elsewhere, once all the relevant permissions have been agreed and a distribution deal negotiated.

<h3>Who</h3>
<p>Commnunity Vision Fellowship is a small- but growing- church located in Duross Heights, New Castle, Delaware. We are part of the Church of God of Prophecy. We are also home to a very active youth group, and a rapidly expanding music program. Our youth group caters to underprivleged kids, and the music program is open to anyone. We offer lessons in guitar, bass, drums, and music theory; we're also building a new church band with the goal of playing out at youth rallies and benefit concerts. Our goal is to offer a comprehensive music education program; classes will be offered free of charge and anyone who wants to perform will get their chance.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What</h3>
<p>We have a clear goal of what we need and how the funds will be spent:</p>
<p>- One thousand dollars will be put towards a new guitar rig. This includes a new amplifier and speaker cabinet, effect pedals, and audio cables.<br/><br/>-Another thousand dollars will be put towards a new bass rig. This includes a new amplifier and speaker cabinet, effect pedals, and audio cables.</p>
<p>-The last thousand will be used for instrument upkeep, upgrades, and repairs. At the time this is is being written, the church owns two electric guitars, two basses, two acoustics, and a drum kit all in need of various parts. Some of this funding will be used to buy new hardware, electronics, and drums. The rest of it will go towards picks, strings, spare audio cables, power supplies, and drumsticks; tools we're always in need of. Indiegogo's 4% will come out of this part of the budget.<br/><br/>-If we surpass our goal, the extra funds will go towards further upgrading our sound system. This includes mics, mixing boards, audio cables, and the like. If we surpass the goal by enough, we could even purchase more instruments. This is all icing on the cake though, the main focus is giving the kids more to work with.</p>
<p>-In the event that we do not reach our goal, the funds will be used to repair and upgrade what we have. How much we can do depends on how much we bring in.<br/><br/>We are more than capable of repairing and upgrading used gear, so every effort will be made to spend the money wisely. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>Music is proven to improve the lives of kids. Music teaches focus, teamwork, creativity, confidence, and improves both math and language skills. The music programs in public schools all over are being cut, and it's up to local communities to pick up the slack. With your help, we could give underprivleged kids the chance to play in a band that goes well beyond their church. Everyone knows how hard growing up can be, and everyone knows the power and magic of music. Let's use the latter to make the former a little easier.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Spread the word!</h3>
<p>Share this all over! The more people that see this, the more likely it is that they'll donate, the more money we'll raise, the more we can accomplish. We have the oppurtunity to not only improve the lives of these children, but also to enrich the local comunity as a whole.</p>

<p> Hey Folks,</p>
<p>I'm here on IndieGoGo to ask for your help to fund a Song-Book for my best-selling album, <strong>""Well, Well,' Said the Rocking Chair'.</strong></p>
<p>The album contains top-40 hits like, <strong>'Lydia' and 'Lucky Stars' </strong>as well as fan-favorites such as,<strong> 'The Deli Song', 'S&amp;M', 'Shopping Bag Ladies', 'Rocking Chair'</strong> and more.</p>
<p>For years now, folks have been asking me to produce a song-book and sheet-music for <strong>""Well, Well,' Said the Rocking Chair' </strong>and my only excuse has been that (a) it's a huge amount of time-consuming work and (b) it's actually quite expensive. Transcribing the music, creating the scores, graphic-layout and design and finally manufacturing, are each time-intensive and costly steps which 'til now I've never been able to find the time or resources to tackle.</p>
<p>I've decided to wait no longer.</p>
<p>But it will only be possible with your help.</p>
<p>The main-stream music-biz isn't going to do it, I can't do it on my own, but with your support I can have <strong>Dean Friedman's ""Well, Well,"" Said the Rocking Chair' Song-Book for Piano &amp; Guitar</strong> ready to ship by the new year (and possibly even by the upcoming holidays).</p>
<p>By the way, this is intended as a 'stretch' campaign, which means, if I succeed in raising the initial funds necessary to produce a <strong>""Well, Well,"" Said the Rocking Chair' Song-Book</strong>, each additional 5k raised will enable me to produce another song-book for each subsequent album<strong>: 'Rumpled Romeo', 'Songs for Grownups', 'The Treehouse Journals', 'Squirrels in the Attic'</strong>, <strong>and 'Submarine Races'</strong>. [note: I still don't own the rights to my first album, <strong>'Dean Friedman'</strong>, so, I'm afraid that one will have to wait - for now.] Again, it's a huge job to even consider producing all these song-books. But with your help - it can actually get done. </p>
<p>Years ago - in fact many years before crowdfunding sites like IndieGoGo and Kickstarter even existed - I sent an email to everyone on my email list asking for help to fund a new album. You came through in a big way and made <strong>'The Treehouse Journals'</strong> possible. You did it again for my last two albums, <strong>'Squirrels in the Attic'</strong> and <strong>'Submarine Races'.</strong> Those albums simply wouldn't exist without your belief and support!</p>
<p>I realize not everyone out there plays an instrument or sings, but I'm hoping enough of you do - or have friends or family that would enjoy receiving this Song-Book as a gift, or would simply like to support my ongoing musical efforts - to succeed in funding this IndieGoGo crowd-funding campaign.</p>
<p>As always, thanks for listening, thanks for all your support and thanks for making all this music possible. If it weren't for your support, over the years, I'd probably be selling wind-mills or solar-panels or electric cars or light-caps with little LED's, or something. Not a bad idea, actually. But I digress. ;-)</p>
<p>Anyway, what I mean to say is... you guys are the best! And I hope this new project is one that strikes a chord with you. And if you're not sure exactly what that chord is, you'll find it in one of these songs-books, which hopefully, you'll help fund in this IndieGoGO campaign.</p>
<p>Nuts &amp; Bolts</p>
<p>If I succeed in raising full 5k, here's what'll happen next:</p>
<p>Step 1:  I'll immediately sit down with a couple of hand-picked transcribers/orchestraters, well-versed in professional notation/scoring software.</p>
<p>Step 2: I'll bring in a graphic-designer to integrate the actual scores into a song-book featuring piano and guitar parts for each song on the album(s).</p>
<p>Step 3: I'll send the final book files to a manufacturer to print up at least 1,000+ copies of the song-book.</p>
<p>Step 4: I'll enlist a group of family, friends and wildlife to pack-up, label and affix postage to all those books and proceed to ship 'em - along with assorted 'perks' listed below - to you good folk! Oh, yeah!, I almost forgot about those perks! You don't think I'd be asking folks for oodles of money and offering nothing in return. No way! Check out the long list of amazing perks I've put together, which you'll receive in return for your generous support. Go ahead, check 'em out. Yeah! Pretty impressive, huh?! So, anyway, once you've all received your cool perks...</p>
<p>Step 5: I will sit back and smile in gratitude at your generosity and support and at the awesomeness of crowd-funding in this strange and bewildering digital age.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned, earlier, if I do succeed in raising the initial funds to produce a Song-Book for <strong>""Well, Well,' Said the Rocking Chair',</strong> every additional 5k I raise will go towards producing a new Song-Book for each successive album. That would mean a Song-Book each for <strong>'Rumpled Romeo', 'Songs for Grownups', 'The Treehouse Journals', 'Squirrels in the Attic'</strong>, and <strong>'Submarine Races'.</strong>  Maybe that's overly optimistic, but hey, you never know.</p>
<p>The Radical and Subversive Impact of Crowdfunding</p>
<p>And here's the thing, folks. don't forget, if I'm actually able to pull this off, it will be only because you guys decided it was worth doing. You didn't leave the decision up to some multinational conglomerate, or non-musical bean-counter... I mean not that I have anything against bean counters. Or beans, for that matter. I like beans. And I like bean counters too. I'm sure they're all decent people with, you known, lovely families. It's just, maybe they shouldn't be the ones in charge of deciding what music you get to hear and what song-books you get to enjoy.  </p>
<p>Anyway, here's the point...</p>
<p>Every time a crowd-funding music project is successful - or any crowdfunding project, for that matter - it represents a small victory for independent musicians, and artists and entrepreneurs of every ilk, over a broken and increasingly irrelevant system of gatekeepers who tightly restrict access between an artist and their audience - and that would be you, the audience, the folks who all this music is meant for! </p>
<p>Anyway, if it works, that'll be cool! And if it doesn't, well you know... 'Light Caps'. I use mine every day, to take out the garbage, change a fuse. It's great for reading in bed. Anyway, it's just an option.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as most of you know, I'm currently in the middle of another 40plus city UK/Ireland tour. So, if for some reason, a Dean Friedman song-book doesn't tickle your fancy, you can still support my musical efforts by buying a ticket to one of the upcoming gigs, or, hey, you could always order one my albums - CD or downloads - via my website <a href=""http://www.deanfriedman.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.DeanFriedman.com</a>. It all helps make it possible for me to continue to pursue my music, all while keeping the electricity turned on in my recording studio.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening - and watching - and I hope to see some of you folks on the upcoming tour!</p>

Meanwhile, as most of you know, I'm currently in the middle of another 40plus city UK/Ireland tour. So, if for some reason, a Dean Friedman song-book doesn't tickle your fancy, you can still support my musical efforts by buying a ticket to one of the upcoming gigs, or, hey, you could always order one my albums - CD or downloads - via my website www.DeanFriedman.com. It all helps make it possible for me to continue to pursue my music, all while keeping the electricity turned on in my recording studio.
Thanks for listening - and watching - and I hope to see some of you folks on the upcoming tour!
Yours,

<h3>THANK YOU AGAIN! :)</h3>
<h3>Short-ish Summary</h3>
<p>Why hello there! My name is Jessica Hoover and I'm a singer-songwriter from Northern Michigan. I've been playing different instruments and singing since I was a young pup, and was then struck by the songwriting bug about ten years ago, and I've been loving it ever since.</p>
<p>To tell you a <strong>very</strong> brief version of my life this past year, I had an accident at work where I suffered a severe head trauma in December 2012. This caused me to lose my memory, forcing me to relearn almost everything. Then on the last day of February 2013, many memories came flooding back. Recovery has been a long and winding road, but I'm so thankful to be alive and to have an amazing support system of family, friends, and my local church.</p>
<p>This EP is personal. These songs display the different emotions we feel when going through the things that life throws our way. Joy, love, longing, loneliness, aching, sorrow, and eventually a peace that passes understanding. </p>
<h3>The biggest thing is... <strong>I HAVE A DEADLINE!</strong> But an awesome one! Because... drumroll please...</h3>
<p>I'm playing in a <strong>HUGE</strong> festival in Traverse City Labor Day weekend (<strong>Bayside Festival</strong>), and I'll be opening for <strong>TENTH AVENUE NORTH</strong>! Whaaat! Yes. Are you excited? I'm excited. So I need the CDs ready to go by then! And to do that, I need to be in the studio <strong>ASAP</strong>!</p>
<p>I have an amazing Producer, Brian Whitscell (More Jesus), who will be leading this project. He loves these songs just as much as I do, and this guy is a big deal (but seriously the most humble person you'll ever meet). No really. If you haven't heard of the More Jesus campaign, Google it, and you will find that Brian has been on some of the Christian music charts for the past several weeks!!! </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need </strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I am doing all of the recording and mixing here in the beautiful and resourceful land of Traverse City, Michigan. Some will be at Rolling Thunder Studios, some will be in a house. This is a very low budget project, so we're trying to save money wherever possible. Your money will be going toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio Time</li>
<li>Musicians</li>
<li>3 Songs (there will be 4 on the EP)</li>
<li>Making the actual CD's</li>
<li>Mixing &amp; Mastering</li>
</ul>
<p>And if we go over the $3,000 goal (which would be AMAZING!), it would go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying my Producer Brian for all of his hard work on this album</li>
<li>A music video for a song on the album </li>
<li>Equipment or merchandise for the festival &amp; beyond</li>
<li>A tour bus (hey, I'm thinking big here) ;)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There's only one way to put this: I'm crazy about Jesus. Even when I lost my memory, I knew who my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ was. He has never left my side, even when going through my darkest moments. I want to honor Him with the talents He has given me, and I want to love His people. The Lord has allowed me to experience so much in such a short period of time, but I have never felt more clear on what I want to do with my life. I want to love others the way Christ loves us, and I want to encourage you and worship the King of Kings with you. This album is just the first step. I want you to partner in this ministry with me!!!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>PRAYER! Pray pray pray. Please pray that the Lord abundantly provides for this project, and that the Lord will absolutely bless the Bayside Festival at the end of August. Pray that the Lord will continuously inspire Brian, the musicians, and I as we are recording this album. </p>

<p><i>“Stay true to yourself, because you are who you are! You are perfect!!”</i></p>
<br/><p>I´m Nana Kuronoma, a cosplayer from 
little Austria.<br/> I´m cosplaying since 2006 and I have experienced a lot since 
then,
<br/>At first, it wasn´t easy. I had no help and had to learn everything by myself, 
<br/>where to buy wigs, how to recognize a high quality textile and where to get good
contact lenses. In the past years, I evolved, and I´m now on a higher level. <br/>Many 
people would call me a „professional  cosplayer“, but thats not how I 
see myself. <br/><br/>I´m quite normal, like all the other cosplayers. <br/>For me it 
is important, to „take care of my fans“.<br/>  For example, If you write a 
messege to me, you can be sure that you will get an answer. And I will 
always help, if someone needs an advice for his/her cosplay. <br/>I will not 
put myself on a <span>podium</span>, just because I have some followers ( v.v). <br/>Of 
course, I´m happy that my fans like my work and that they hang it up in 
their rooms, but what is really amazing  is when people at conventions 
come over to me and tell me that they like my attitude and that I 
encourage them. What can be more beautiful?<br/><br/>So, that´s a little bit about myself, now to the important part.<br/>This whole thing is about one of my dream Cosplays of all time.<br/>Asuka in her Plugsuit and Rei in her Plugsuite from Neon Genesis Evangelion.<br/>As my Fans will know, I did both of them, but this time will be different.<br/><br/>The Suits are handmade for me, out of latex. I LOVE THESE PLUGSUITS!!<br/>They will fit perfectly on my body and will be one of my best Cosplays so far.<br/><br/>My plan is, to raise the money, <br/>(I saved a litle amount by myself, so you don´t have to do all the work XD)<br/>As I mentioned before, I cosplay for my fans, so If you help me, to get my suits, actually you help yourself. Not only for the good feeling you have helped me to <br/><span>realize</span> my dream, there will be some rewards for special amount of donations.<br/><b><br/>What will I do with the money?</b><br/><br/>First of all I will buy these awesome and perfect latex plugsuits (I LOVE THEM), <br/>this will be about 2/3 of the money,<br/>Next thing is to organize the photo shoots.

many of you know, Daniel Johnson and I released <i>Daughter of the
Mountain, </i>Volume I of The Mantra Project, in January of this year.
We've been blown away by the positive response, deeply moved to learn how many
lives this music has touched. </p>
<p><i>Daughter
of the Mountain </i>was
a prelude; the cosmic clearing of our musical throat. After our long hiatus
from recording, we initially envisioned a simple kirtan album. Once back in the studio however, the possibilities of audio technology inspired
us to break new creative ground. As the music unfolded, we realized we were
developing a unique 21st century sound for the ancient mantras we love and
revere... and The Mantra Project was born. </p>
<p>We've
now begun developing music for Volume II. We're eager to get back to the studio,
and can't wait to share the new music with you. This next album will be
amazing, featuring mantras and chants of the goddess, and packed with rich
layers of my vocals and Daniel's inspired tabla grooves. We're also inviting a
group of incredible guest artists to be part of this recording. We want to
weave traditional vedic chant, flute, cello, horn, and guitar into the musical
textures. Imagine soaring vocals, reverberating mantra, lyrical melodies, and
the driving pulse of the drum. This is what I hear when I close my eyes. This
is what we want this album to be: a rich tapestry filled with awesome beauty and luminous
power.</p>
<p>But
we want to do it right. And for this we need to raise at least $25,000. After
hearing <i>Daughter of the Mountain</i>, one listener wrote, ""This

<p>After years of writing, rehearsing and performing all over the UK, we are finally ready for the next level! Come April, we will be taking our music to the studio, and putting our collection of Soulful songs on a record!</p>
<p>After a show late last year in the heart of London,<i> </i>we were approached by Stacy Parrish, a seasoned Producer who has worked with some of the biggest names in the history of music, including <strong>Robert Plant</strong>, <strong>Alisson Krauss</strong>, <strong>Randy Newman </strong>and <strong>T-Bone Burnett</strong> to name a few.

<p><strong>So, why do we need your help?</strong> Committing music to a recording is a daunting task; a little known fact is that the production will either make or break a song, so you have to put a lot of faith in who you are working with to make sure your record is the best it can be, and you most certainly get what you pay for! The money that you generously donate will go towards all costs, including Travel, Recording, Mixing, Mastering, Printing, Distribution (Physical and digital), PR, Promotion and all other incurring costs.</p>
<p><strong>What will you get in return? </strong>The most important question of them all! The more you choose to Donate, the bigger and better the reward you get!

<p>Hi! my name is Cherine Amr. I'm the frontwoman and guitarist of the Egyptian band ""Massive Scar Era"" (<a href=""http://www.massivescarera.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.massivescarera.com</a>)</p>
<p>I started MSE back in 2005 with my band mate and music companion, Nancy Mounir.<br/>I met Nancy in a jazz concert in 2005. I wasn't into Jazz but a friend of mine used to play the guitar in that band.<br/>Nancy was sitting right next to me, at that time I didn't know her at all. She had her violin with her and I watched her as she was interacting with the music. <br/>I met her again at the backstage while we were congratulating our friend for the show, I was very curious to know her background in music and asked her to jam. </p>
<p>In our first jam, the moment she picked up the violin, I thought we could NEVER be in the same band. She also felt the same; She wasn't into metal music at all and I was never into classical music. </p>
<p>10 years later! I can't imagine playing music without her. We have developed a very interesting way in writing music together. We don't know how we did that! but we know that we enjoy creating music together.</p>
<p>For 10 years we have faced all obstacles together! I wasn't allowed to play music at all, Massive Scar Era was our ""secret"" project! <br/>I wasn't allowed to jam with boys, so Nancy and I had to look for every girl in the country to join the band.<br/>We weren't allowed to play many venues as metal music as you probably know isn't really that ""favorable"" in Egypt, so we played underground shows without permits that most probably ended with being shut down by the police.... IT WAS NEVER EASY and it will never be! but it was always exciting and fun.. and we will cherish every memory of the journey in our hearts!</p>
<p>I moved to Canada and we managed to finish our new EP (thank you Mr internet!), being away from each other has also had an influence on the way we write music together ; we believe that our new EP is very different from any other music we wrote before. We have evolved our sound to incorporate more dramatic orchestration, heavy guitar riffs and intense lyrics. WE CAN NOT WAIT TO SHARE IT WITH YOU ALL! </p>
<p>The EP "" 30 Years"" will be released on 15th August and will be followed by a mini tour in BC and I can't possibly imagine doing a tour with our new music without Nancy! it wouldn't make any sense, right? <br/>so please help us bringing Nancy to British Columbia to promote our new record and create more music! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Touring is expensive! you probably have heard... but we aren't asking for much, we just need to cover Nancy's airline tickets from Cairo + her visa expenses.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Canada is a new territory for us. We have played Europe and USA but never toured Canada.  Creating new audience in a new territory isn't always easy but it's ALWAYS FUN! <br/>We are very excited about this mini tour and we really feel the Canadians in the west coast will enjoy our music. It will also be our starting point to network within the industry. we have more music that we would like to record but we can't afford to! we want to play more around the world but we need to start somewhere! <br/> </p>

<p>In the fall of 2015, I began the journey of creating my first full length album, “A Home to Run to.” I am proud to announce now, almost a year later, the album is finished. I am incredibly proud of these songs and the album as a whole. I wrote the songs, produced them, and recorded each instrument on the album. The songs are so much bigger and more intricate than anything I’ve attempted before, and I’m incredibly proud of each one of them. That being said, I’ve now come to the end of the road of what I can do, and it’s time to hand the album off to be professionally mixed and mastered (an experience I’ve never had before)! But, being the poor college student that I am, I can’t afford that. So here’s where you come in.</p>
<p>I need your help to fund the mixing and mastering of this album. It is being mixed by Lynn Grabber in Nashville, and mastered by Grammy award winning engineer Andrew Bergthold. This album is so much bigger than the two EPs I’ve released so far. I am proud of those projects as well, and they have given me a great vision of what I want in my sound. This album is just that. Not only am I excited about the sound of this album, I’m excited about the message that these songs will bring. Whether it’s reminiscing on fun summer memories, or coping with insecurities and finding strength outside ourselves, these songs have messages we can all relate to. These songs have been very meaningful and personal to me, and I genuinely hope that listeners find meaning in them as well.</p>
<p>I would love to have your support in completing this album. This has been an amazing journey, and I invite you join along with me in seeing it through to the end!</p>

<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>My name is Dr. Jesse Cook. I am the Assistant Professor of Trumpet at Valdosta State University.</p>
<p>            I am in the final stages of preparation for my inaugural CD release,<i> Imagined Conversations: American Music for Trumpet</i>. The album will feature solo trumpet music by composers John Williams, Libby Larsen, Michael Djupstrum, Zack Stanton and David Sterrett. This music is, in my opinion, some of the best trumpet writing done in the past 20 years, yet none have been recorded with the piano reduction - as they’d be performed in competition or recital. All of these pieces are wonderful additions to the trumpet repertoire, and I believe, are worthy of being recorded.</p>
<p>            As many of you know, producing a full-length commercial CD is an expensive and exhaustive process. In order to make this recording, I need to raise $4,250 in the next month, which breaks down to 150 backers donating $30 each.

<p align=""center""><strong><u>Works To Be Recorded:</u></strong></p>
<p>            I have long been a proponent for expanding the repertoire and reach of the trumpet. In that vein, I asked Zack Stanton, Lecturer in Music Theory and Composition at the University of Iowa, to compose a piece which could be used in graduate student and professional level national solo competitions. Dr. Stanton’s <i>Imagined Conversations, A Sonata for Trumpet and Piano </i>was premiered at Valdosta State University on August 31, 2017. The seminal recording of this work will give greater exposure to this excellent young American composer and aid in promotion of the piece.</p>
<p>            John Williams’ <i>Concerto for Trumpet and Piano </i>was commissioned by the Cleveland Orchestra in 1996. The piano reduction was released the following year; the piece has since been a mainstay on the competition circuit. When performed in competition, the concerto is always presented in the piano reduction. However, there are no commercial recordings of this version; the lack of a quality reference recording has produced many unsuccessful competition performances by trumpet artists who have never heard the work performed. Inclusion of this piece on the CD aims to fix this issue. A recording of this landmark composition in the trumpet repertoire will aid students and professionals around the globe.</p>
<p>            I performed Michael Djupstrum’s <i>Puck </i>three times in recital in fall 2016, and learned that it is popular among non-expert audiences and increases interest in the classical trumpet field. <i>Puck </i>is not a known work but has the potential to become a standard competition piece. Although the piece was originally composed for trumpet and string orchestra the piano reduction demands technical mastery and musicality from both the soloist and pianist. However, the piano reduction keeps intact the string colors through the use of extended techniques (secondary uses) on the instrument. This creates an unusual tonal palette throughout the piece not often found in piano reductions.</p>
<p>            David Sterrett is a freelance trumpet artist and composer in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. He wrote <i>Rhapsody </i>for his own masters’ degree recital at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston and the piece has unfailingly received rave reviews from students and professionals. <i>Rhapsody </i>is freely structured with near improvisatory sections and luxurious melodic lines. I performed this work at the 2017 International Trumpet Guild Conference in Hershey, PA. The performance and composition received rave reviews. In my opinion, a quality recording of <i>Rhapsody </i>will likely lead to high demand across the trumpet community nationwide.</p>
<p>            Libby Larsen is one of the foremost American composers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. <i>Ridge-Runner</i>, though widely appreciated, is rarely performed due to its unusual scoring for trumpet and two percussionists. I believe inclusion of <i>Ridge-Runner </i>will round out the CD artistically with the contrasting tonal palettes offered by the multiple percussionists as well as serve the wider musical community with the first reference recording for the piece.</p>
<p>            I hope you make the choice to support my inaugural CD, and help grow the repertoire of the trumpet as well!</p>
</div></div>","Hi everyone!
My name is Dr. Jesse Cook. I am the Assistant Professor of Trumpet at Valdosta State University.
            I am in the final stages of preparation for my inaugural CD release, Imagined Conversations: American Music for Trumpet. The album will feature solo trumpet music by composers John Williams, Libby Larsen, Michael Djupstrum, Zack Stanton and David Sterrett. This music is, in my opinion, some of the best trumpet writing done in the past 20 years, yet none have been recorded with the piano reduction - as they’d be performed in competition or recital. All of these pieces are wonderful additions to the trumpet repertoire, and I believe, are worthy of being recorded.
            As many of you know, producing a full-length commercial CD is an expensive and exhaustive process. In order to make this recording, I need to raise $4,250 in the next month, which breaks down to 150 backers donating $30 each.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Sita Rose. I chant. I sing. I create and inspire others to do the same. I am gifted at guiding people to access the full range of their voice for creative expression, energetic release, and spiritual integration. When we connect to our creativity, we connect to our life force. But so often self-judgment and fear interrupt this process and we experience energetic blocks or dis-ease. The idea for my album, <i>In Essence,</i> is a direct result of my work as a board-certified music therapist, yoga student, and Kirtan leader. </p>
<p>I wanted to create an album that serves as a point of reference for anyone who wants to take command of their voice. Permission that you no longer need permission to sing and experience its benefits. I wanted to create a tool to accompany the journey of self-discovery. This album is more than just music, it’s a launch pad for creativity, inner harmony, and catalyst for healing. Each track is Divinely inspired, reflecting the “essence” of each Chakra.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, singing in the community became obsolete. Cultures came to America with their medicine songs, but the longer they stayed, the softer they sang.  I encounter one too many individuals who have been told as a young child that they ""can't sing.” Singing has been shown to release mood-elevating endorphins and enhance personal bonds.</p>
<p>In the spirit of building community, I ask for your help in making this album a reality. This project is bigger than me, It is a movement. And your support is essential.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this.</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<ul><li>7 Produced original tracks (one track for each of the 7 major Chakras or energy centers) </li></ul>

<p>35% will go towards other expenses including; album art, album release concert, music video production costs (videographer, crew)</p>
<p>5% Extra cushion for unexpected expenses such as additional mastering/recording fees, extra musicians, permits)</p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>You get to be part of the process, this movement of radical expression toward self-discovery. You get a grateful heart from me. Music for healing, and a wealth of gratitude bundles for backing this project.</p>
<h3>What Happens If We Don't Reach Our Goal</h3>
<p>I trust in abundance for this project. But there’s value in planning for all possible outcomes. So, if for some reason I don’t make my goal, the album release party/concert can be scaled down. While I have great visions for it, birthing this album into the world is the priority.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Music heals. It really is as simple as that.</p>
<p>For me, music was an outlet I turned to when I started to experience the pressure of adolescence, of not quite fitting in. Music allowed me to express difficult emotions and explore parts of myself that rarely got much stage time. I went on to study music in college, it started to become a dreaded responsibility. I convinced myself I had to fit into a mold and be the perfect vocalist, the perfect performer, and that perspective killed my love for singing. Until I found Kirtan through my yoga teacher training. The ancient practice of chanting was the breath of freshness I needed to rekindle my connection to my voice. My heart opened up. I experienced the transformation of singing for devotion, offering up the duality of sound to something greater than me.</p>
<p>Beyond the research, music connects us to the present moment. It is an effective way to regulate the nervous system and enhance our awareness. It’s a beautiful practice that deserves to be shared. Mantra, chant, toning, humming. We can shift our vibration and recalibrate our thoughts through musical meditation. This is the movement. This is the practice. And this album is rooted in its wisdom.</p>
<p>The voice is a direct expression of the love in our hearts, the power of our worth, and the innate intelligence of our body. The vibrational aspect of the voice accesses stagnated energetic blocks in our body.  </p>
<p>Your support allows me to expand my reach. When people discover freedom in their voice, they embody it. Internal awareness leads to external compassion for the betterment of society as a whole.  </p>

The Story of the Cave Recordings
In the early spring of 2015 Max Brumberg and Maxence des Oiseaux started a series of recordings in the famous Cueva de la Pileta in Andalucia. Guided by Tomas Bullon and Karmit Evenzur we entered the cave with a sentiment of deep humility. 

Here we would not be musicians playing music, but individuals played by the music through our instruments of wood, bone and horn…  Music in the moment, outside of time; the notes flowing in ceremony as the space awakens and memories flood our sight in the form of mental images.
The Pileta is a temple dedicated to, and with evident symbolism of, the Feminine:  by way of the geothermic conditions which evoke the maternal womb; by pictorial representations of the vulval form; and most notably by the initial painting which greets us at the entrance of the cave: that of the Venus (our cover), one of the oldest of such paintings known in Europe.There are strong indications of a connection between these paintings which decorate the cave and the acoustic properties brought to life there in the cave while playing music: Archeological research has found fragments of bones encrusted in stalagmitic accretions demonstrating that humans have long since beat upon these natural lithophones, utilizing this sanctuary for over 30,000 years to the purpose of auditory sensation....we were allowed to play them!


On this album we welcome you along on an evocative journey, a peaceful voyage beyond time to bring you to these memories of humanity.

</div>","Short Summary
Hey everyone! We are The Naturals,
Marquette University's first and only all-male a cappella group, and we are
trying to do something that has never been done before. Marquette has truly
become a hotbed for collegiate a cappella, featuring the talents of The
Meladies, Gold 'n Blues, and yours truly, but we want to do something to
take our school's singing scene to the next level: make the first ever
combined a cappella album featuring all three groups.
This
album will feature 13 songs total:

Four songs by
     The Naturals - ""Electric Love"", ""Victorious"",
     ""Coffee"" and ""Lady, You Shot Me""
Four songs each
     by The Meladies and Gold 'n Blues
A special
     combined song featuring all the members of ALL 3 GROUPS

The
album will be available for download on iTunes and Loudr and for streaming on
Spotify.
So
why make an album like this? A lot of reasons. 
For
one, we know that all of our groups are great, but often lack the platform
to showcase our sound beyond our individual fan bases. An album breaks down
those walls by bringing fans of each group together for a shared musical
experience. 
In
addition, we know Marquette students, faculty and alumni LOVE
this school. We feel we can bring the whole MU family
together by putting out an amazing album while also saying ""thank
you"" for being a part of this awesome university community. 
Last
but not least, through working together over the years on other events
such as our own concerts, Acatoberfest, and our
Christmas Concert, the three groups have realized we work best when
we work together. Combining to record one album also allows us to reduce
our costs, and being on the same album pushes us to be
the best we can be.
What We Need & What You Get
To
make this album, each group needs to raise $3000 total for a total cost of just
about $9000. Our cost breakdown is roughly as follows:

$2300 for
     recording, mixing and editing by our producers, Matt Caruso and Nick
     Wright of www.acappellapsych.com
$400 for lodging
     and flights for Matt and Nick when they come to record at Marquette
$200 for
     mastering – the finishing touches an album needs – from www.vocalmastering.com
$100 for
     licensing our music - making it legal - and getting it on iTunes, Loudr
     and Spotify

To
help us get there, we’ve created a variety of “perks” at different levels of
funding. These include new Naturals apparel, including stickers, sunglasses,
shirts, and the famous Bow Tie itself. We also offer the opportunity to meet us
and receive a private performance at a rehearsal and even to help us pick a
song for next semester’s setlist! 
We
are scheduled to record the album from March 4th to March 16th. If we don’t reach our goal, we will spend all the money we
do take in to cover these costs, and scrounge up the rest by… well… we’re not
sure. Lemonade stands? Garage sales? Shirtless car washes? Yeah, you don’t want
it to come to that.
The Impact

Risks & Challenges
We
have a short time frame to finish this campaign – it ends on March 21st
– and we have a lot of work to do in that time.  However, we’ve done this

The
logistics of recording may seem challenging, but we’ve got it all figured out.

</p><p><br/></p><p>16 July 2015 -- Just got notice when I tried to post last update -- I've run out of space to blog... watch this space for instructions to find the rest of the news</p><p><br/></p><p>14 July 2015 – We only thought that the retirement home was
our last gig.  Formally that was
true.  In practice, well… we ended up
playing with a band that is apparently quite famous, <b>Chant de Coton Blues Band</b>, at <b>Brasserie
le Tagalou</b>.  According to the folks
who run le Tagalou, Jam, the lead singer in Chant de Coton Blues Band is among
the most famous of French popular singers.</p><p>
</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436863251/egknyrykxv7xbzg97peu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>It was a wild night for a bunch of old folks like us.  We went for dinner at seven, and knew the
blues band was set to play all evening. 
The restaurant was a two minute walk from our flat – its biggest
attraction when we chose it.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436863616/sfu27vs0xvwyzpkqobnf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The band
was setting up as we arrived.  We ended
up at the adjacent table as they had their dinner.  The folks at le Tagalou already knew we were
from Hawaii and gradually came to understand that we are a band.  When we told them about the <b>Kai Moku Journey</b>, they and the band
wanted us to get up and play.
</p><p>
</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436863791/seu8uuidpqwwva0xc4ob.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>And play we did. 
Chant de Coton Blues Band took two breaks to let us hijack their gig – I
felt a little guilty, knowing how it is when someone horns in on your gig.  But they said they loved it, were honored to
play with us – as we were with them. 
Limited to one microphone, one uke, one guitar and one bass,
supplemented by their drummer and harmonica player, we played several songs and
Sue danced, then DJ danced, and in the second set, DJ got the crowd up and
taught them <i>E Huli Makou</i>.  </p><p>

As with every other place we played, this crowd was
enthusiastic in response to our music.  A
guy Pat and I had met on the street – we befriended his little dog first, then
him – showed up at the restaurant on a date. 
He was so excited about the music he brimmed over.  </p><p>He said that the spirit and energy of the
music touched his soul.  He understood
when I said the purpose of our tour was to spread a little aloha around the
world.  In his view we were succeeding.
</p><p>
We closed out with <i>Hawaii
Aloha</i> and the patrons were truly touched. 
One guy, who works for a US company in France, said he hadn’t been to
Hawaii but now would be sure to make the trip.
</p><p>
A dozen or more of the patrons, from young to old, came up
to us and thanked us for sharing our music and hula.  They had no idea previously what Hawaiian
music was, some didn’t know what or where Hawaii was.  Half a dozen said now they must visit the
islands.  To those folks, I handed out
Molokai post cards and download cards for <b><i>Na Ohana Hoaloha: LIVE!</i></b>.  </p><p>And I gave a set to the band, too.  Sue stayed on to dance to the music of Chant
de Coton Blues Band until well past midnight. 
What a night.
</p><p>
Oh, I almost forgot to mention the food.  FANTASTIC!!! 
Uncle had Steak Tartar that was spiced to perfection.  The fillet of beef that Pat and I had was
nothing short of amazing.  But the salmon
that most of the band had – that was beyond amazing – poached and with a Dijon
sauce and served cold.  It exploded on
the palate.  Every morsel of food was
magnificent.
</p><p>
13 July 2015 – Last gig of the tour.  Whew. 
We just wrapped up playing at <b>Maison
de retraite - ORPEA - Croix-Rousse</b>, located at 19 rue Philibert Roussy in
Lyon (04).  We played to an audience of
about forty with the residents aged 69 to 102. 
Okay so the 102 year old didn’t show for the performance.  I guess they were heading out to the disco
and needed to get on their fancy clothes. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436864066/rmwqyps0gfdrirqjkqwm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>

Like every other gig on this trip it was a very good
experience for the band and brought some happiness to a crowd that lives a
pretty tough life.  The facility was
clean and nice with a staff that seemed helpful and kind, even warm.  There were visitors, too.  Certainly not everyone in the world gets this
quality of care.  Yet, it was not a happy
place, but for the moment of distraction.
</p><p>
Sue was a big hit with the old guys.  Two flirted endlessly and one of those two
got up twice to dance with her.  He
didn’t really want to let go, either. 
One older woman had her eye on Uncle Herb.  Got up and walked over and sat down next to
him, leaning in to watch the show, of course. 
Herb stayed above it all, oblivious.
</p><p>The staff enjoyed the part where DJ taught hula – and the
old guy hanging on to Sue had a blast, too. 
The staff did an enthusiastic <i>Hukilau
</i>followed by an even more exciting <i>E Huli
Makou</i>.  One young woman on staff took
to it like a duck to water.  The
assembled residents seemed to get a big kick out of watching the staff dancing.</p><p>

The location was really great, just up the hill from our
flat.  Elevation change of maybe 500 or
700 feet.  Auntie and Uncle were joined
by Bully for the cab ride, carrying all of our equipment.  </p><p>DJ, Sue, Pat, and I hoofed it up the mountain
through a beautiful park that was created out of the estate of Joseph Gillette,
the namesake of the street where our flat is located – quai Joseph Gillette.  Amazing views from the garden and a huge section
of hillside dedicated to native plants.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436864846/ojw77nvhzd7r2ldo8crl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>The walk down was easier. 
Shortly we’ll head over to a restaurant down the block for dinner.  There is a blues band playing shortly after
we are planning to arrive.  Should be
interesting.</p><p>

Yesterday, Sunday, was a quiet day for long walks.  A lot of wandering through this amazing city
of Lyon.  DJ has become enamored with the
frescos, wall art, and even graffiti in general here.  He has been photographing even what appear
gang signs.  But the frescos are incredible.
</p><p>
</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436865091/uj3bjgjhcthu5urq8qjz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>We ended the day with an odd dinner that
exceeded ALL expectations.<span>  Almost all
services are close don Sunday in France. 
<b>Domino’s Pizza</b> was an
exception.  Okay, I didn’t like the
idea.  I mean, come on, we’re in the
culinary capital of the world and we eat at Domino’s?  But what a surprise.  The pizza selection did not resemble US
pizza.  I had a salmon and crème fresh
pizza that was a gourmet treat.  Each of
the four we ordered was more than special. 
Domino’s US – take a note, learn from your brothers in Lyon.</span><br/>
</p><p>
</p><p>Saturday, a day of recovery from our Friday night gig, was
the day that Pat and I used to hunt for Moeck recorders – a renaissance
instrument that Pat uses in our music but once played in its native sound
palate with a band in Springfield, Illinois that referred to themselves as “tootlers”
– excellent Renaissance and early Baroque musicians who played for a lot of
historic events (which happened all of the time in hometown of Abe Lincoln).</p><p>

We wandered around and with DJ’s help found a little music
shop that sold Yamaha guitars.  The owner
there pointed us to a music store about 3 klicks away.  We walked through old town and the high end
shopping district of Lyon – there are fashion shop show rooms from Paris
designers where they test market their latest designs.  We ended up on Place Bellecour at a wonderful
music store, <b>Bellecour Musiques</b>.
</p><p>
</p><p>Pat found a beautiful pair of Moeck recorders to complete
her tonal set --- she found an Ebony alto recorder (lower registers) and a
lovely maple soprano.  She started
practicing with the band immediately to integrate them in for our Sunday
performance.</p>
<p>To close the day Saturday, Pat and DJ and I scoped out
restaurants within easy walking distance – Auntie Julia is having a lot of
trouble with her knee on this trip – it will be replaced in August.  We found <b>L’assiette
du Marche</b> at 21 Grande rue de Vaise, just across the river.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436865350/rd4af3hkuk45p4xmhvdx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Amazing does not begin to touch the wonders of the food at
this restaurant.  The limited menu gave
the band dishes based on rabbit and salmon. 
Both were spectacular.  But the
thrill of the evening was the executive chef. 
No English, yet we were able to communicate.  Hilarious. 
We had a taste test comparing his French sea salt to our hand gathered
Molokai sea salt.  It was a draw –
neither side conceding defeat.  We’ll go
back for another meal.</p>
<p>11 July 2015 – The whirlwind has been like a force four
tornado.  There has not been a moment to
reflect or write since I snuck in the last blog entry after the “big gig” in
Geneva.  It’s Saturday morning here and
we have two days off before the next gig. 
So here’s the story, working backward to Wednesday. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436689212/fzc9tpwo6x1jbtcagngf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b><i>The Aloha Bar</i></b></p>
<p>Friday night, Lyon France, old town, the Aloha Bar.  I still have to laugh, the Aloha Bar in Lyon
France.  The owner’s never been to
Hawaii.  But the theme is well done in
the bar.  Think back streets of
Waikiki.  Hole in the wall bar, but cool
– in a lot of ways it reminded me more of New York, east side of Manhattan,
where there are tons of little, themed bars. 
Nicola, the owner, sweet, enthusiastic guy.  He has the aloha spirit.</p>
<p>Here’s the bar before opening.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436682711/sq5klpw4ysx3l09lc0bp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We were at the back of the bar area where we could have some

<p>The Aloha Bar packed full as the band got rolling.  We were playing acoustically, so pretty soon
we were overwhelmed with bar noise.  But
the crowd was more than attentive, in their own way.  They requested that we teach them some hula
and the party really rocked.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436684876/o8vtuwt26qfuqn6e2ai9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Here’s DJ teaching hula. 
The woman in the blue dress and glasses was trained as a belly dancer
and picked up hula like she was born to it. 
So fun to watch.</p>
<p>Great conversation with American Club folks after we
finished playing.  It was clear that a
huge portion of the aloha spirit had been served and taken in by this crowd.</p>
<p>Before the gig, our transit from our apartment to the Aloha
Bar had been a little rocky.  DJ, Bully,
Sue, and I walked.  We stopped at the
Music Center to pick up the small bass amplifier I had purchased for our Lyon
gigs earlier in the day and Bully carried it the rest of the way to the bar.  Back at the apartment we had bundled the rest
of the band and instruments into a Lyon Taxi – thank you Claire Point for
helping us negotiate this.  However, the
cab dropped off Pat with Auntie and Uncle at the wrong end of the block and
pointed them in the wrong direction at the bar end of the ride.  </p>
<p>Ever resourceful, Pat sat Auntie and Uncle down at a café
and searched out the gig.  While Auntie
was sitting in a chair at the closed bistro, the owner walked up and asked if
she needed anything, brought her water, and offered help.  Pat returned with everything scoped out and
also had some water while the three waited for the walkers to arrive.  </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436687732/iezxdgqxlbazppxrtzpw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When Pat tried to leave a couple of Euros in appreciation of
the service, the owner said, “Non!” 
Jackie wouldn’t take our money. 
And having learned what we were there to do, she later showed up and
cheered us on at her competitor, the Aloha Bar. 
</p>
<p>The story doesn’t end there. 
After the gig, the band decided on dinner at Jackie’s restaurant, El
Sombrero (9, rue Pizay).  The restaurant
has a Mexican chef and Jackie’s husband, the executive chef, is Cordon Bleu
trained. The food was beyond amazing. 
Here are a bunch of food pictures.</p><p>Enchiladas in mole sauce</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436687840/nj1iatscalzztml5utmh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Auntie was a little more eventful.  One
way streets required a different route. 
The shortcut of the tunnel was “ferme” – closed – so the taxi headed
over the mountain.  What mountain, one
might ask.  One Pat did.  And they flew down a winding, narrow road, flashing
brights and waiting for oncoming traffic because it was essentially one
lane.  But, according to Pat, the views
were more than spectacular as they entered the Saône Valley from the mountain
top.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436688611/hihu5qu3hxipnrzwhjdr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b><i>Kanikapila at Claire’s House</i></b></p>
<p>Lyon is the home of Claire Point, her husband Sebastian, and
her three sons.  Claire is an important
person in my life and has been for more than a decade.  She arrived in my life as an intern at
Chelsea Group.  During her time in that
role she lived in our home in Itasca, Illinois. 
Many important life stories for Pat and me revolve around Claire.</p>
<p>Claire was so kind as to invite the entire band into her
home the evening we arrived in Lyon.  She
drove to our flat from her home 15 klicks upstream on the Saône in a van
borrowed from a neighbor.  We piled into
the van and felt like we’d gone home. 
Here’s Claire with the van and you’ll quickly see why we were so
comfortable.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436689604/jtun44olu88iuud0ptvm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A ’68 Ford Econoline, with wood panel interior and signage
offering its origin in Haliewa, Hawaii – a town on the North Shore of Oahu
where big wave surfing is life.  Claire,
you outdid yourself.  But the best was
yet to come.</p>
<p>The drive to Claire’s home took us up the Saône Valley
through beautiful scenery just as the sun was beginning to set.  Here’s a picture of the dashboard hula dancer
with the Saône, a barge, and the Saône Valley in the background.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436689758/xmredblxa7mmckiusbib.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We arrived at Claire’s home in Neuville sur Saône as the
bells chimed on the half hour.  She
piloted the enormous van into the tiny back street and parked near her front
door.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436690010/nqcfilizpv1zgf4aorg1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The home was built in the late

courtyard.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436689903/rsvawuuauyhlhnlotoyf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We played for our dinner. 
Claire and Sebastian, friends Oliver and Angela, and Claire’s cat paid
rapt attention as we played song after song. 
Sue danced.  Angela, trained in
classical ballet, tried to learn hula as she went, but finally just let the
music move her.</p>
<p>It was midnight before we landed back at the flat.  Pat had stayed home because of her cold and
deeply saddened to hear what she had missed.</p>
<p><b><i>Travel from Geneva to Lyon</i></b></p>
<p>Adventure. 
Daring.  Seductive Hawaiian
music.  Confusion.  Error.

<p>We had arranged to take the train from Geneva to Lyon.  JP, our harmonica player left us in Geneva to
return to Bristol and personal obligations. 
I dropped him at the airport after packing the equipment at the US
Mission and having a great chat with Ambassador Hamamoto.  </p>
<p>Pat and I dropped off the rest of the band at the train
station in downtown Geneva.  We had
difficulty exiting the parking garage because of misdirection about parking
fees.  Next, Pat and I go lost trying to
exit downtown Geneva for the airport.  We
took one wrong turn and entered one way hell. 
We were separated when Pat got caught in a turn lane and I went on to
the next intersection. We were both panicked and running out of time, driving
separate cars and with no communications since her phone was dead.</p>
<p>I wiggled through a new route that took me in an odd way
into the airport.  Pat was trapped in the
lake shore drive but then found her way to the route we knew from our commute
to our house in Segny.  With zero
communication some sort of odd magic happened and we ended up together as we
entered the Budget return gate.  Both of
us were greatly relieved.</p>
<p>But then we were on to the sprint to find the train from the
airport to the railway depot in downtown Geneva.  Signage was unhelpful.  Finally a kind Police Officer pointed us to
the train offices where a very, very sweet woman guided us to our proper
course.  We grabbed the next train and
made it just in time to join the rest of the band in boarding the train to the
French frontier where we were supposed to change trains to catch “Lyon Part
Dieu”.  </p>
<p>We missed the stop at Bellegarde.  Clueless. 
DJ and I ran to find the conductor. 
No English.  Again, magic happened
and two young women, Sisters Mattinson and Baggs, doing their missionary work in France (I am not making this
up there’s a picture of them below) appeared and translated.  Yes, the conductor explained, we could catch
a different Lyon Part Dieu train from the next station and arrive only a few
minutes later.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436690593/fe0crz05wtgy8fqspqse.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>That left us on the platform at Aix-les-Bains for nearly an
hour.  Pat broke out her ukulele, then
Julia.  Pretty soon the platform was
alive with music, hula, and aloha.  Pat
taught this little girl how to strum the ukulele.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436690792/h39yrxtev4kcsbgkipql.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>

<p><b><i>Island Nations</i></b></p>
<p>Soundcheck seemed to draw the crowd down from security into
the garden.  The Ambassador spoke briefly
and then we exploded into Tewe Tewe.  The
party was on.  Over 200 representatives
of the smaller island nations gathered to coalesce around the band and the
spirit of aloha.  The Swiss halau was in
top form.  The audience, this time seated
in auditorium format on the well shaded lawn, responded to the energy of the set.
</p>
<p>It was grand, dream-like: Wednesday afternoon, five to
seven, back at the garden on the campus of the US Mission in Geneva, the
security and staff treat us as part of the team.  It is a nice feeling.  We can hardly take a step without someone
thanking us for the beautiful music and bringing the spirit of aloha to Geneva
station.</p>
<p>The interaction with the audience was different in
nature.  At the end of the performance we
chatted with folks comfortably.  They were
full of questions and we did our best to answer.  It was clear that the music and hula touched
them with the spirit of aloha.</p>
<p>The band had spent the prior 24 hours recovering from the Tuesday
Independence Day celebration.  The high
temperatures on Tuesday had cooked the band – it turned out to be the hottest
day on record in Geneva, ever, any day, since records have been kept – which is
a long time.  Fortunately the pool at the
house had been cleaned and we were able to cool off a bit, even though the
water was near 90 degrees F.  It helped.</p>
<p>We had grand plans for our “time off” on Wednesday.  Mostly we slept or walked around in a
daze.  My fingers hurt from the long
guitar session the day before.  Bully’s
hand was cramping.  Pat’s voice was
rough.  Auntie was just exhausted.  DJ, somewhat bouncy, kept our spirits
agitated.  We prepared for the long day
ahead.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436691287/dhlx33ulv1bspix9adeh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The day did not end with the performance for the Island
Nations.  Ambassador Hamamoto invited us
to her residence on Lake Geneva for a private dinner – just Pam and the
band.  And in that context, it was Pam,
not “The Ambassador”.  We kicked off our
shoes, talked in Pidgeon, and swapped stories of Hawaii.  </p>
<p>Most important, we got to play with Sandy, Pam’s beautiful
old dog.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436691395/s2mywfdnknltd7wt7nfe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Pat and I had met Sandy when we
had visited Pam at her California home a few years ago.  Sweet, sweet dog.  She so reminds me of Rufus.  I rolled on the floor playing with her.  Despite the elegant surroundings, it was a
perfectly comfortable thing to do.  But
then, that’s the tone Pam set.  </p>
<p>The meal was unforgettable. 
Pam’s chef at the residence, Hussein, is originally from Senegal.  Fabulous chef with a touch for flavors and
presentation unparalleled in my experience. 
Each course was a jewel in its own right and the combination sparkled
like a tiara.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436691752/bykwlcnjd5ctlpm2zh3f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We talked long into the night.  It was hard to say goodbye.  Pam is a gracious host and a good
friend.  Like the band, she lives aloha.  Our country is fortunate to have someone with
such talent and substance in our service.</p>
<br/><div>
</div><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>8 July 2015 – We’re all recovering
from a natural high.  Buoyed by a huge
dose of the spirit of aloha, we all stayed up into the night talking through
the excitement and joy of a hugely successful performance for the US Mission to
the United Nations yesterday.  </p><p>Here's the video</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FLsGsY8N1Xe8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLsGsY8N1Xe8%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLsGsY8N1Xe8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>From the Ambassador – Pam Hamamoto: feedback from the
audience was that the gathered 1,200 or so diplomats from over 170 countries had
an overwhelming positive response to the combination of her speech on spreading
the spirit of aloha and the music and dance we brought to the event.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436692459/ymu8wbrdipgpbyeztadi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>A celebration of the US Independence Day
yielded not the usual jingoism but instead a spirit of global cooperation to
solve the pressing problems we all know from the world news.</p>
<p>This is what Pam had asked us to do and we did it.  </p>
<p>Plus it was a lot of fun. 
</p>
<p>We performed in three sets. 
The first set was the welcome.  We
played while the participants in the event passed through the beautifully done
security process and through the reception line.  Four Ambassadors – Pam is head of station –
greeted the guests.  Our music and the
dancing of the Swiss halau brought them into the heart of the event.</p>
<p>Once the guests were all in and security closed the gates,
the ceremony celebrating the birth of the United States was underway.  A Marine Honor Guard presented the
colors.  A quartet of State Department
officials from the Geneva Mission provided a brilliant rendition of the Star
Spangled Banner.  It brought tears to our
eyes – a magical interpretation hauntingly performed in soaring harmonies.</p>
<p>Pam’s speech equally reached the highest levels of
diplomatic presentation.  From the band’s
perspective we were most honored by this: Last year Pam made a commitment to
bring the spirit of aloha to her work with the UN in Geneva; this year she
brought us, as the flesh and blood embodiment of that spirit, as an emblem of
how that spirit is being realized.  Na
Ohana Hoaloha was presented to the world as the living embodiment of the Spirit
of Aloha.</p>
<p>This is a duty we do not take lightly.  And in the second set we demonstrated how, through
international cooperation with a Swiss hula halau, the musical and dance
heritage of Hawaii could be shared with everyone.  Plus we were ON!  </p>
<p>The weather did not make this easy.  The temperature crossed 40 degrees C (100+
degrees F) and there was no wind.  Bully
became dizzy.  Auntie lost her
place.  All of us dripped with
sweat.  But we persisted.  And we performed at the top of our game.  </p>
<p>The coordination with the Swiss began in the fall of
2014.  Their halau sent representatives
to Molokai in early February to coordinate. 
But it was not until July 6<sup>th</sup> that we were able to practice together.  No one in the audience would have guessed
that.  The flow of the program and
quality of song and dance presented to the audience was nearly flawless.</p>
<p>We opened with a song from our new album, Tewe Tewe.  Our arrangement combines chant, powerful ipu
rhythms, and intense starts of the vocal segments.  There were cheers among the audience.  The Swiss followed that with some beautiful
kahiko (ancient) hula danced to their own chants and ipu.  </p>
<p>We restarted with a song that will be on our next album,
Mokio Sunrise.  That was followed by
Green Rose Hula.  Our arrangement of the
song alternates full band and acapella versions of the verse.  The Swiss danced and played ipu as they did –
the combination through the acapella verses created an impression of a cross
between kahiko and auana that was very compelling.  Again, huge audience response.</p>
<p>We finally took a break after the second set and grabbed a
light lunch from what was left of the buffet. 
Standing in the shade of the trees was a real relief after the stage
heat.</p>
<p>The third set was more of a real party for us.  We kicked it off with teaching a bunch of
very enthusiastic folks how to do the Hukilau, an easy hula taught by DJ with
support from Sue and the Swiss halau. 
That was followed by Hawaiian Hoki-poki. 
We had three ambassadors up dancing – led by Pam.  Laughter filled the grounds.  A childlike joy filled the hearts of all.</p>
<p>Days like this are not just rare.  We have reached the pinnacle of the Kai Moku
Journey.  Now we will wind our way down
the mountain as we spread a little more aloha in Geneva and then on to Lyon to
share some more.</p>
<p>Watch this space…</p>
6 July 2015 – We made it to Geneva.  Thanks to help from JP and his son Michael, the
departure went smoothly from Bristol, England. 
Yesterday, which was Sunday the 5<sup>th</sup>, we had an early, early
start.  We left JP’s house a little
before 4am.  
<p>The dawn trip through the English countryside was
beautiful.  The farms surrounding Bristol
were just waking up.  The light gave a
gold tint to the crops and windrows shedding precious insight into the spirit
of the land.  Farm homes and out buildings,
many from three, four, and five centuries past, took on a warmth that bespoke
the energy of their people.</p>
<p>JP herded our band of cats through the early morning
crowds.  His experience as a world traveler
shone through – kindness to the harried EasyJet staff was reciprocated with
easy passage for us.  Pat’s arrangement
were again flawless.</p>
<p>Here’s a picture of our row of musicians on the EasyJet
Plane</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436161262/j2n046kp75po6tkorgju.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Martin, our friend from the US Mission in Geneva, met us at
the baggage claim once we landed.  This
was a purely volunteer effort on Martin’s part – he took time away from his
visiting family to greet us.  He took up
JP’s role and used his diplomatic credentials to smooth our way.  Martin, if you recall, is a top notch bass
player.  He and Bully bonded over the
ukulele bass and their preferences in music. 
THANK YOU, Martin!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436692614/ngzxve2joodfethezbkl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Soon enough we were rolling through the French countryside
on our way to the home we rented in Segny (“Sig-Knee”).  Sundays are quiet days in rural France.  The only place open for lunch was an American
bistro known throughout the world as McDonalds. 
We munched on French Micky-D food while we waited for the property
manager to open the house.  The food was
good.  I had a goat cheese wrap that was
beyond delicious and the best thing I remember eating at a McDonalds.</p>
<p>The house turned out to be just as amazing as we
imagined.  We quickly divvied up sleeping
space and everyone was comfortable.  The
heat is the only problem.  They had
warned us as we landed that the temperature would be 38.  That’s in degrees C.  Read 99 in degrees F.  Killa.</p>
<p>The view from the house</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436161349/ysqwwu7cw2btgrhkcj1f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The temperature came down in the evening, heading for the
mid 20s – 70-ish.  We went out to dinner
at one of the few places open and had a wonderful experience.  With JP speaking French, seemingly fluently,
we had an easy time of picking great menu items and getting great services from
a very friendly staff.  </p>

<p>4 July 2015 – Happy Birthday America!  And Happy Birthday Hannah Parsons – JP’s
beautiful granddaughter.  We’re still
staying with Michael and his family in Bristol England.  Here's the house with Pat going in the walk.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436161893/gcy7sjbqbe9sk65cc5zc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p>We have our second gig tonight at the

<p>The owner saw us play at the Duck and almost instantly set
up for us to play the Saturday night crowd at her place.  Here’s the poster she developed (and signed, “with
much love, Rhone”) for us.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436161705/pvg2ei8jsfe2fqw8roip.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Rhona fed us extremely well. 
The food at the Victoria is excellent. 
We had several different entrees among us and everyone loved their
choices.  Here’s a shot of pub food.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436161781/fluv2rcgdbwdssbgnm45.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>What a night!  Folks
who had seen us at the Duck started showing up. 
The place packed up.  We already
have Na Ohana Hoaloha groupies in Bristol England!  One couple there was so enthused they invited
us to come back next year to play for their wedding.  Another couple, with the woman due with a
baby girl at any moment, want to visit and consider moving to Hawaii after the
experience.  She even danced the hula
when DJ taught the Hukilau – but threatened to have her baby right then and
there!</p>
<p><br/></p><p>4 July 2015 – A day of touring with our intrepid guide, Michael Parsons.  Not only is he an incredible host for our visit to Bristol, he is a brilliant tour guide.  Michael is a highly skilled and qualified buildings expert.  He gave us an amazing perspective on the history of Bristol through its architecture.  </p><div>

</div><p>3 July 2015 – The Black Swan Pub (known to the regulars as
the Dirty Duck, or just the Duck) will never be the same after the hula lesson
and the closing circle.  The Aloha Spirit
was palpable by the end of our performance. 
Here’s video of Sue inspiring the pub crowd to take up hula.</p><div>
</div><p>Joining us for the evening was JP’s grandson Joshua.  He got the crowd into sing-along mode with a
hit from the 1960s by the Monkeys called “I’m a Believer”.  Here’s a clip of Joshua leading the crowd in
that song.</p><div>
</div><p>The session ended with a request from the audience for two
things – a simple hula that DJ could teach them and for us to sing the song Hukilau.  We combined the two requests and DJ taught
about ten or so folks how to dance the Hukilau while the band played it once
slowly for teaching purposes and then once up to full speed.  What a blast. 
They were quick learners!</p><div>
</div><p>The evening ended with a request from the owner of a nearby
pub to play Saturday night at her place.

</div><p>2 July 2015 – We’re in England now,
getting ready for our first pub gig.  We
arrived yesterday, about 25 hours from the time we got going on Oahu and more
than 40 hours from the time we left Molokai. 
The whole band was together for the flight across the country and the

</div><p>Our Harmonica Player, JP (John Parsons), and his grandson
Joshua (at right in photo above) picked us up in a 14-passenger Transit Van and ferried us to Bristol.  There we were warmly welcomed by Joshua’s
parents, Michael and Natasha, and his sister Hannah.  JP, ever the proud grandpa, shepherded us
around the town.</p><div>

</div><p>We spent an hour at the pub where we’ll play tonight.  JP’s friend Chris and a group of pub goers
welcomed us.  The sign out front let
everyone know that tonight (Thursday, July 2) will be Hawaiian night with live

today.  Pat, Bully, and I left topside

</div><p>Everyone flies over to Honolulu tomorrow, Monday, June 29<sup>th</sup>,
and gets set for the early departure on Tuesday.  We’re all staying with family or friends –
THANK YOU for your continuing support and willingness to get up before dawn to
see us off.  We rendezvous at HNL between
4:45 and 5:00 am on Tuesday morning.  And
then… we’re leaving on a jet plane…</p><div>
</div><p>Today is our last regular weekly performance at Paddlers’
Inn before we head into the wild blue yonder. 
We’ve picked out songs from the tour book and we’ll use the performance
as a practice of sorts.  Should be a good
send-off with all of our regulars there to cheer us on.</p><div>
</div><p>Bully has been hanging with his other musician friends and
says that they are happy to see us be, as they call it, “ambassadors for
Molokai”.  Thanks, guys, and proud to do
it.</p><div>
</div><p>We’re still in pre-release for our CD.  We’ve had some good feedback and I got the CD
into the hands of Derrek Malama, a great DJ who does his “Kanekapila Sunday”
every week on Hawaii Public Radio – great show. 
He’s also the host of Morning Edition on HPR, so you may have heard his
voice if you are an NPR freak like me.  I’m
hoping Derrek likes a few cuts and gives us some air time.  Thanks to Deane Neubauer – regular supporter and
fan of ours – for making the introduction to Derrek.</p><div>

GREAT.  Thank you Bully, thank you
DiscMakers.  And for you on-line music

</div><p>We’ve developed our pre-release approach and have a draft of
our launch events in Europe and in the US. 
For those of you who have done this before, we are open to tips on
effective kick-off efforts.</p><div>
</div><p>The European launch will, of course, be the July event in
Geneva, were “world-wide distribution” will earn its name.  We will hand CDbaby Digital Download Card of <b><i>Na Ohana
Hoaloha: LIVE! </i></b>to representatives
of over 170 nations while they listen to us play.  </p><div>
</div><p>The US Launch will take place upon our triumphant return to
Paddlers Inn on Molokai.  We’re
scheduling it for Sunday, July 19<sup>th</sup>. 
It’s going to be a blast.  We’ll
show videos and photos from our European Tour. 
The State Department will be filming our programs in Geneva and they
have offered to share.  We’ll play a
little of the music, talk story, and soak in the good vibes.</p><div>

17 June 2015 – Things are spinning up
pretty fast now.  Our new album, <b><i>Na
Ohana Hoaloha: LIVE!</i></b> Launched in digital download form on Sunday and is
available at <a href=""http://cdbaby.com/cd/naohanahoaloha"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>http://cdbaby.com/cd/naohanahoaloha</u></a>
and looks great and sounds great.  You can
listen to samplings of the music at that site and buy if you like – one song at
a time or the whole shootin’ match.  
</div><p>Our instruments shipped from Molokai, headed for Geneva
Switzerland on Tuesday (June 16).  Pat
and George stayed up ‘til past midnight packing the case and doing the shipping
paperwork.  Both talked to Martin in
shipping and receiving at the US Mission to the United Nations in Geneva to
make the arrangements for their receipt. 
</p><div>
</div><p>So cool, turns out Martin has played bass professionally, so
he was totally understanding of our trepidation at shipping our favorite instruments!  They are slated to arrive in Geneva on June
23<sup>rd</sup>.  Martin will check them
out and make sure everything is playable. 
We’re much more comfortable having talked to Martin.</p><div>
</div><p>Here are two pictures of Martin -- the manager of the shipping and receiving activities at the US Mission in Geneva --  as I said, cool...</p><div>

France, too.  Lisa, a Vice President of
the Club and an events coordinator, is setting up a reception at the Aloha Bar
in Lyon – can you believe it a Hawaiian themed bar in Lyon France!</p><div>
</div><p>Here’s the funny part -- we had checked their Facebook page
and found the Aloha Bar was forced to close on June 9<sup>th</sup> for
structural repairs to their building.  We
were bummed.  On Sunday the band talked
about offering to do some sort of fundraiser to help them back on their
feet.  But lo, and much to our surprise,
they are already back in business.</p><div>
</div><p>So it looks like really cool gigs in three countries – England
(Bristol), Switzerland (Geneva), and France (Lyon).  Still looking for more gigs – retirement center
or something – in Lyon, too.</p><div>

</div><p>14 June 2015 -- The date of the departure from Molokai grows closer.  And closer.   We've locked in virtually all of our travel arrangements now.  Tomorrow we ship our instruments to the US Mission to the UN in Geneva.  The band spent all day yesterday going over progress and plans.</p><div>

</div><p>Virtually every detail of our travel
plans is locked down now – thank you Pat. 
You can see the pages with golden color on them – these are our play
lists for the Geneva performances.  All
of these are locked in now too.</p><div>
</div><p>We’ve made a lot of accommodations to reduce the cost of the
trip. One really good example is the
U-bass (an ukulele set up like a bass guitar). We found it costs about ¼ as much to buy Bully
a U-bass than to ship his beautiful Modulus electric bass to and from
Geneva.  Bully is extremely happy with
the new little bass, which sounds just like a stand-up bass when
amplified.  He’s even happier now that we
have installed Aquila “red” strings, like we use on all of our regular
ukuleles.  They have a smooth and gentle
touch.  </p><div>

</div><p>US Ambassador Pamela Hamamoto in her speech to the US Independence Day celebration last year remarked: ""I thought long and hard about how best to bring the aloha spirit all the way 
from Hawaii, 7,700 miles — or I should say, 12,000 kilometers! – and spread it 
around Geneva, the UN, and all the international organizations. ""  She chose to bring our little band from the island of Molokai, Hawaii, to this year's celebration to do just that.</p><div>
</div><p>This is our second campaign to raise funding for Kai Moku.  Our first effort, which closed on May 2nd,  achieved 26% (about $10,000) of our goal of $35,000.  </p><div>

</div><p><strong>The <em>Kai Moku</em> Album Notes</strong></p><div>
</div><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b><i>Na Ohana Hoaloha: LIVE! </i></b>… Album Notes on CD Baby:</p>
<p><i>Take a little trip to
the island of Moloka'i. Na Ohana Hoaloha has drawn well over 10,000 audience
members to its Sunday afternoon performances of Hawaiian music and hula over
the past ten years. Here is your chance to hear some of our great performance
time captured live and in full audio color.</i></p>
<p><i>The album opens with a
rousing version of ""Tewe Tewe"", a classic Hawaiian song performed
here in part chant, part chorus. Heavy on the rhythm of the islands, you can
understand, even without knowing the Hawaiian language, that this song about
catching fish isn't just about fishing. Squirming, squirming. Is that about
fish or...</i></p>
<p><i>An old song reborn,
the next track is ""Green Rose Hula"". Only Na Ohana Hoaloha can pull
off this combination of rapid guitar work balanced against a cappella runs of
each verse. Harmonies abound.</i></p>
<p><i>""Hi'ilawe"",
a classic of the Hawaiian scene, is done here in a version for which beautiful
choreography has been developed by band member and kumu hula (teacher or master
of hula) DJ Pelekai. A warm version or the song, DJ's beautiful voice lets it
paint a picture of the waterfalls at Hi'ilawe while portraying the emotions of
two lovers as they learn of the gossip flying around about them.</i></p>
<p><i>""Holoholo""
in Hawaiian is similar to the idea of walkabout in Australia. ""Holoholo
Fun"" is an original song by band member George Benda and was inspired by
his dog Rufus, a Golden Retriever that was the neighborhood dog ambassador.
Rufus had a ""happy dance"" as he walked that is captured in the energy
and bounce of this song.</i></p>

Late and Breaking


































16 July 2015 -- Just got notice when I tried to post last update -- I've run out of space to blog... watch this space for instructions to find the rest of the news14 July 2015 – We only thought that the retirement home was
our last gig.  Formally that was
true.  In practice, well… we ended up
playing with a band that is apparently quite famous, Chant de Coton Blues Band, at Brasserie
le Tagalou.  According to the folks
who run le Tagalou, Jam, the lead singer in Chant de Coton Blues Band is among
the most famous of French popular singers.
It was a wild night for a bunch of old folks like us.  We went for dinner at seven, and knew the
blues band was set to play all evening. 
The restaurant was a two minute walk from our flat – its biggest
attraction when we chose it.  The band
was setting up as we arrived.  We ended
up at the adjacent table as they had their dinner.  The folks at le Tagalou already knew we were
from Hawaii and gradually came to understand that we are a band.  When we told them about the Kai Moku Journey, they and the band
wanted us to get up and play.

And play we did. 
Chant de Coton Blues Band took two breaks to let us hijack their gig – I
felt a little guilty, knowing how it is when someone horns in on your gig.  But they said they loved it, were honored to
play with us – as we were with them. 
Limited to one microphone, one uke, one guitar and one bass,
supplemented by their drummer and harmonica player, we played several songs and
Sue danced, then DJ danced, and in the second set, DJ got the crowd up and
taught them E Huli Makou.  

As with every other place we played, this crowd was
enthusiastic in response to our music.  A
guy Pat and I had met on the street – we befriended his little dog first, then
him – showed up at the restaurant on a date. 
He was so excited about the music he brimmed over.  He said that the spirit and energy of the
music touched his soul.  He understood
when I said the purpose of our tour was to spread a little aloha around the
world.  In his view we were succeeding.

We closed out with Hawaii
Aloha and the patrons were truly touched. 
One guy, who works for a US company in France, said he hadn’t been to
Hawaii but now would be sure to make the trip.

A dozen or more of the patrons, from young to old, came up
to us and thanked us for sharing our music and hula.  They had no idea previously what Hawaiian
music was, some didn’t know what or where Hawaii was.  Half a dozen said now they must visit the
islands.  To those folks, I handed out
Molokai post cards and download cards for Na Ohana Hoaloha: LIVE!.  And I gave a set to the band, too.  Sue stayed on to dance to the music of Chant
de Coton Blues Band until well past midnight. 
What a night.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention the food.  FANTASTIC!!! 
Uncle had Steak Tartar that was spiced to perfection.  The fillet of beef that Pat and I had was
nothing short of amazing.  But the salmon
that most of the band had – that was beyond amazing – poached and with a Dijon
sauce and served cold.  It exploded on
the palate.  Every morsel of food was
magnificent.

13 July 2015 – Last gig of the tour.  Whew. 
We just wrapped up playing at Maison
de retraite - ORPEA - Croix-Rousse, located at 19 rue Philibert Roussy in
Lyon (04).  We played to an audience of
about forty with the residents aged 69 to 102. 
Okay so the 102 year old didn’t show for the performance.  I guess they were heading out to the disco
and needed to get on their fancy clothes. 

Like every other gig on this trip it was a very good
experience for the band and brought some happiness to a crowd that lives a
pretty tough life.  The facility was
clean and nice with a staff that seemed helpful and kind, even warm.  There were visitors, too.  Certainly not everyone in the world gets this
quality of care.  Yet, it was not a happy
place, but for the moment of distraction.

Sue was a big hit with the old guys.  Two flirted endlessly and one of those two
got up twice to dance with her.  He
didn’t really want to let go, either. 
One older woman had her eye on Uncle Herb.  Got up and walked over and sat down next to
him, leaning in to watch the show, of course. 
Herb stayed above it all, oblivious.
The staff enjoyed the part where DJ taught hula – and the
old guy hanging on to Sue had a blast, too. 
The staff did an enthusiastic Hukilau
followed by an even more exciting E Huli
Makou.  One young woman on staff took
to it like a duck to water.  The
assembled residents seemed to get a big kick out of watching the staff dancing.

The location was really great, just up the hill from our
flat.  Elevation change of maybe 500 or
700 feet.  Auntie and Uncle were joined
by Bully for the cab ride, carrying all of our equipment.  DJ, Sue, Pat, and I hoofed it up the mountain
through a beautiful park that was created out of the estate of Joseph Gillette,
the namesake of the street where our flat is located – quai Joseph Gillette.  Amazing views from the garden and a huge section
of hillside dedicated to native plants.  The walk down was easier. 
Shortly we’ll head over to a restaurant down the block for dinner.  There is a blues band playing shortly after
we are planning to arrive.  Should be
interesting.

Yesterday, Sunday, was a quiet day for long walks.  A lot of wandering through this amazing city
of Lyon.  DJ has become enamored with the
frescos, wall art, and even graffiti in general here.  He has been photographing even what appear
gang signs.  But the frescos are incredible.

We ended the day with an odd dinner that
exceeded ALL expectations.  Almost all
services are close don Sunday in France. 
Domino’s Pizza was an
exception.  Okay, I didn’t like the
idea.  I mean, come on, we’re in the
culinary capital of the world and we eat at Domino’s?  But what a surprise.  The pizza selection did not resemble US
pizza.  I had a salmon and crème fresh
pizza that was a gourmet treat.  Each of
the four we ordered was more than special. 
Domino’s US – take a note, learn from your brothers in Lyon.

Saturday, a day of recovery from our Friday night gig, was
the day that Pat and I used to hunt for Moeck recorders – a renaissance
instrument that Pat uses in our music but once played in its native sound
palate with a band in Springfield, Illinois that referred to themselves as “tootlers”
– excellent Renaissance and early Baroque musicians who played for a lot of
historic events (which happened all of the time in hometown of Abe Lincoln).

We wandered around and with DJ’s help found a little music
shop that sold Yamaha guitars.  The owner
there pointed us to a music store about 3 klicks away.  We walked through old town and the high end
shopping district of Lyon – there are fashion shop show rooms from Paris
designers where they test market their latest designs.  We ended up on Place Bellecour at a wonderful
music store, Bellecour Musiques.

Pat found a beautiful pair of Moeck recorders to complete
her tonal set --- she found an Ebony alto recorder (lower registers) and a
lovely maple soprano.  She started
practicing with the band immediately to integrate them in for our Sunday
performance.
To close the day Saturday, Pat and DJ and I scoped out
restaurants within easy walking distance – Auntie Julia is having a lot of
trouble with her knee on this trip – it will be replaced in August.  We found L’assiette
du Marche at 21 Grande rue de Vaise, just across the river.  
Amazing does not begin to touch the wonders of the food at
this restaurant.  The limited menu gave
the band dishes based on rabbit and salmon. 
Both were spectacular.  But the
thrill of the evening was the executive chef. 
No English, yet we were able to communicate.  Hilarious. 
We had a taste test comparing his French sea salt to our hand gathered
Molokai sea salt.  It was a draw –
neither side conceding defeat.  We’ll go
back for another meal.
11 July 2015 – The whirlwind has been like a force four
tornado.  There has not been a moment to
reflect or write since I snuck in the last blog entry after the “big gig” in
Geneva.  It’s Saturday morning here and
we have two days off before the next gig. 
So here’s the story, working backward to Wednesday. 
The Aloha Bar
Friday night, Lyon France, old town, the Aloha Bar.  I still have to laugh, the Aloha Bar in Lyon
France.  The owner’s never been to
Hawaii.  But the theme is well done in
the bar.  Think back streets of
Waikiki.  Hole in the wall bar, but cool
– in a lot of ways it reminded me more of New York, east side of Manhattan,
where there are tons of little, themed bars. 
Nicola, the owner, sweet, enthusiastic guy.  He has the aloha spirit.
Here’s the bar before opening.
We were at the back of the bar area where we could have some
floor space for dancing.  Nice
setting.  The whole gig had been set up
by Lisa Arsac, Vice President and Events Coordinator for the American Club –
this was a pau hana (after work) informal gathering of the Club members as a
reception for the band.  Lisa has been
incredible, getting our time in Lyon organized. 
Here’s Lisa with the band – playing my guitar brilliantly
(wink, wink – she doesn’t play).  And
another shot with her very supportive husband Cyril.  
We started playing about 6:45, warm ups.  Nice small crowd.  I could explain the band and the Kai Moku
Journey.  Very attentive.  But the crowd rolled in about seven and we
went to town with livelier music and hula. 

The Aloha Bar packed full as the band got rolling.  We were playing acoustically, so pretty soon
we were overwhelmed with bar noise.  But
the crowd was more than attentive, in their own way.  They requested that we teach them some hula
and the party really rocked.
Here’s DJ teaching hula. 
The woman in the blue dress and glasses was trained as a belly dancer
and picked up hula like she was born to it. 
So fun to watch.
Great conversation with American Club folks after we
finished playing.  It was clear that a
huge portion of the aloha spirit had been served and taken in by this crowd.
Before the gig, our transit from our apartment to the Aloha
Bar had been a little rocky.  DJ, Bully,
Sue, and I walked.  We stopped at the
Music Center to pick up the small bass amplifier I had purchased for our Lyon
gigs earlier in the day and Bully carried it the rest of the way to the bar.  Back at the apartment we had bundled the rest
of the band and instruments into a Lyon Taxi – thank you Claire Point for
helping us negotiate this.  However, the
cab dropped off Pat with Auntie and Uncle at the wrong end of the block and
pointed them in the wrong direction at the bar end of the ride.  
Ever resourceful, Pat sat Auntie and Uncle down at a café
and searched out the gig.  While Auntie
was sitting in a chair at the closed bistro, the owner walked up and asked if
she needed anything, brought her water, and offered help.  Pat returned with everything scoped out and
also had some water while the three waited for the walkers to arrive.  
When Pat tried to leave a couple of Euros in appreciation of
the service, the owner said, “Non!” 
Jackie wouldn’t take our money. 
And having learned what we were there to do, she later showed up and
cheered us on at her competitor, the Aloha Bar. 

The story doesn’t end there. 
After the gig, the band decided on dinner at Jackie’s restaurant, El
Sombrero (9, rue Pizay).  The restaurant
has a Mexican chef and Jackie’s husband, the executive chef, is Cordon Bleu
trained. The food was beyond amazing. 
Here are a bunch of food pictures.Enchiladas in mole sauce
Chiles rellenos We retraced our steps back to the apartment and captured
great views of Lyon at night.  This is
one of the most photogenic cities in the world.
The taxi ride back to the apartment for Pat, Uncle, and
Auntie was a little more eventful.  One
way streets required a different route. 
The shortcut of the tunnel was “ferme” – closed – so the taxi headed
over the mountain.  What mountain, one
might ask.  One Pat did.  And they flew down a winding, narrow road, flashing
brights and waiting for oncoming traffic because it was essentially one
lane.  But, according to Pat, the views
were more than spectacular as they entered the Saône Valley from the mountain
top.
We debriefed in the comfort of our very posh flat on the
Saône.
Kanikapila at Claire’s House
Lyon is the home of Claire Point, her husband Sebastian, and
her three sons.  Claire is an important
person in my life and has been for more than a decade.  She arrived in my life as an intern at
Chelsea Group.  During her time in that
role she lived in our home in Itasca, Illinois. 
Many important life stories for Pat and me revolve around Claire.
Claire was so kind as to invite the entire band into her
home the evening we arrived in Lyon.  She
drove to our flat from her home 15 klicks upstream on the Saône in a van
borrowed from a neighbor.  We piled into
the van and felt like we’d gone home. 
Here’s Claire with the van and you’ll quickly see why we were so
comfortable.
A ’68 Ford Econoline, with wood panel interior and signage
offering its origin in Haliewa, Hawaii – a town on the North Shore of Oahu
where big wave surfing is life.  Claire,
you outdid yourself.  But the best was
yet to come.
The drive to Claire’s home took us up the Saône Valley
through beautiful scenery just as the sun was beginning to set.  Here’s a picture of the dashboard hula dancer
with the Saône, a barge, and the Saône Valley in the background.  
We arrived at Claire’s home in Neuville sur Saône as the
bells chimed on the half hour.  She
piloted the enormous van into the tiny back street and parked near her front
door.  The home was built in the late
1800s.  It is built of Saône river rock,
just like the garden wall below, but covered with hard plaster.  Sebastian,
Claire’s husband, has beautifully renovated the kitchen.  Through the kitchen we entered the amazing
courtyard.  
We played for our dinner. 
Claire and Sebastian, friends Oliver and Angela, and Claire’s cat paid
rapt attention as we played song after song. 
Sue danced.  Angela, trained in
classical ballet, tried to learn hula as she went, but finally just let the
music move her.
It was midnight before we landed back at the flat.  Pat had stayed home because of her cold and
deeply saddened to hear what she had missed.
Travel from Geneva to Lyon
Adventure. 
Daring.  Seductive Hawaiian
music.  Confusion.  Error. 
Recovery.  We had it all.
We had arranged to take the train from Geneva to Lyon.  JP, our harmonica player left us in Geneva to
return to Bristol and personal obligations. 
I dropped him at the airport after packing the equipment at the US
Mission and having a great chat with Ambassador Hamamoto.  
Pat and I dropped off the rest of the band at the train
station in downtown Geneva.  We had
difficulty exiting the parking garage because of misdirection about parking
fees.  Next, Pat and I go lost trying to
exit downtown Geneva for the airport.  We
took one wrong turn and entered one way hell. 
We were separated when Pat got caught in a turn lane and I went on to
the next intersection. We were both panicked and running out of time, driving
separate cars and with no communications since her phone was dead.
I wiggled through a new route that took me in an odd way
into the airport.  Pat was trapped in the
lake shore drive but then found her way to the route we knew from our commute
to our house in Segny.  With zero
communication some sort of odd magic happened and we ended up together as we
entered the Budget return gate.  Both of
us were greatly relieved.
But then we were on to the sprint to find the train from the
airport to the railway depot in downtown Geneva.  Signage was unhelpful.  Finally a kind Police Officer pointed us to
the train offices where a very, very sweet woman guided us to our proper
course.  We grabbed the next train and
made it just in time to join the rest of the band in boarding the train to the
French frontier where we were supposed to change trains to catch “Lyon Part
Dieu”.  
We missed the stop at Bellegarde.  Clueless. 
DJ and I ran to find the conductor. 
No English.  Again, magic happened
and two young women, Sisters Mattinson and Baggs, doing their missionary work in France (I am not making this
up there’s a picture of them below) appeared and translated.  Yes, the conductor explained, we could catch
a different Lyon Part Dieu train from the next station and arrive only a few
minutes later.
That left us on the platform at Aix-les-Bains for nearly an
hour.  Pat broke out her ukulele, then
Julia.  Pretty soon the platform was
alive with music, hula, and aloha.  Pat
taught this little girl how to strum the ukulele.
Spread the aloha.
Island Nations
Soundcheck seemed to draw the crowd down from security into
the garden.  The Ambassador spoke briefly
and then we exploded into Tewe Tewe.  The
party was on.  Over 200 representatives
of the smaller island nations gathered to coalesce around the band and the
spirit of aloha.  The Swiss halau was in
top form.  The audience, this time seated
in auditorium format on the well shaded lawn, responded to the energy of the set.

It was grand, dream-like: Wednesday afternoon, five to
seven, back at the garden on the campus of the US Mission in Geneva, the
security and staff treat us as part of the team.  It is a nice feeling.  We can hardly take a step without someone
thanking us for the beautiful music and bringing the spirit of aloha to Geneva
station.
The interaction with the audience was different in
nature.  At the end of the performance we
chatted with folks comfortably.  They were
full of questions and we did our best to answer.  It was clear that the music and hula touched
them with the spirit of aloha.
The band had spent the prior 24 hours recovering from the Tuesday
Independence Day celebration.  The high
temperatures on Tuesday had cooked the band – it turned out to be the hottest
day on record in Geneva, ever, any day, since records have been kept – which is
a long time.  Fortunately the pool at the
house had been cleaned and we were able to cool off a bit, even though the
water was near 90 degrees F.  It helped.
We had grand plans for our “time off” on Wednesday.  Mostly we slept or walked around in a
daze.  My fingers hurt from the long
guitar session the day before.  Bully’s
hand was cramping.  Pat’s voice was
rough.  Auntie was just exhausted.  DJ, somewhat bouncy, kept our spirits
agitated.  We prepared for the long day
ahead.
The day did not end with the performance for the Island
Nations.  Ambassador Hamamoto invited us
to her residence on Lake Geneva for a private dinner – just Pam and the
band.  And in that context, it was Pam,
not “The Ambassador”.  We kicked off our
shoes, talked in Pidgeon, and swapped stories of Hawaii.  
Most important, we got to play with Sandy, Pam’s beautiful
old dog.  Pat and I had met Sandy when we
had visited Pam at her California home a few years ago.  Sweet, sweet dog.  She so reminds me of Rufus.  I rolled on the floor playing with her.  Despite the elegant surroundings, it was a
perfectly comfortable thing to do.  But
then, that’s the tone Pam set.  
The meal was unforgettable. 
Pam’s chef at the residence, Hussein, is originally from Senegal.  Fabulous chef with a touch for flavors and
presentation unparalleled in my experience. 
Each course was a jewel in its own right and the combination sparkled
like a tiara.
We talked long into the night.  It was hard to say goodbye.  Pam is a gracious host and a good
friend.  Like the band, she lives aloha.  Our country is fortunate to have someone with
such talent and substance in our service.



8 July 2015 – We’re all recovering
from a natural high.  Buoyed by a huge
dose of the spirit of aloha, we all stayed up into the night talking through
the excitement and joy of a hugely successful performance for the US Mission to
the United Nations yesterday.  Here's the video
From the Ambassador – Pam Hamamoto: feedback from the
audience was that the gathered 1,200 or so diplomats from over 170 countries had
an overwhelming positive response to the combination of her speech on spreading
the spirit of aloha and the music and dance we brought to the event.  A celebration of the US Independence Day
yielded not the usual jingoism but instead a spirit of global cooperation to
solve the pressing problems we all know from the world news.
This is what Pam had asked us to do and we did it.  
Plus it was a lot of fun. 

We performed in three sets. 
The first set was the welcome.  We
played while the participants in the event passed through the beautifully done
security process and through the reception line.  Four Ambassadors – Pam is head of station –
greeted the guests.  Our music and the
dancing of the Swiss halau brought them into the heart of the event.
Once the guests were all in and security closed the gates,
the ceremony celebrating the birth of the United States was underway.  A Marine Honor Guard presented the
colors.  A quartet of State Department
officials from the Geneva Mission provided a brilliant rendition of the Star
Spangled Banner.  It brought tears to our
eyes – a magical interpretation hauntingly performed in soaring harmonies.
Pam’s speech equally reached the highest levels of
diplomatic presentation.  From the band’s
perspective we were most honored by this: Last year Pam made a commitment to
bring the spirit of aloha to her work with the UN in Geneva; this year she
brought us, as the flesh and blood embodiment of that spirit, as an emblem of
how that spirit is being realized.  Na
Ohana Hoaloha was presented to the world as the living embodiment of the Spirit
of Aloha.
This is a duty we do not take lightly.  And in the second set we demonstrated how, through
international cooperation with a Swiss hula halau, the musical and dance
heritage of Hawaii could be shared with everyone.  Plus we were ON!  
The weather did not make this easy.  The temperature crossed 40 degrees C (100+
degrees F) and there was no wind.  Bully
became dizzy.  Auntie lost her
place.  All of us dripped with
sweat.  But we persisted.  And we performed at the top of our game.  
The coordination with the Swiss began in the fall of
2014.  Their halau sent representatives
to Molokai in early February to coordinate. 
But it was not until July 6th that we were able to practice together.  No one in the audience would have guessed
that.  The flow of the program and
quality of song and dance presented to the audience was nearly flawless.
We opened with a song from our new album, Tewe Tewe.  Our arrangement combines chant, powerful ipu
rhythms, and intense starts of the vocal segments.  There were cheers among the audience.  The Swiss followed that with some beautiful
kahiko (ancient) hula danced to their own chants and ipu.  
We restarted with a song that will be on our next album,
Mokio Sunrise.  That was followed by
Green Rose Hula.  Our arrangement of the
song alternates full band and acapella versions of the verse.  The Swiss danced and played ipu as they did –
the combination through the acapella verses created an impression of a cross
between kahiko and auana that was very compelling.  Again, huge audience response.
We finally took a break after the second set and grabbed a
light lunch from what was left of the buffet. 
Standing in the shade of the trees was a real relief after the stage
heat.
The third set was more of a real party for us.  We kicked it off with teaching a bunch of
very enthusiastic folks how to do the Hukilau, an easy hula taught by DJ with
support from Sue and the Swiss halau. 
That was followed by Hawaiian Hoki-poki. 
We had three ambassadors up dancing – led by Pam.  Laughter filled the grounds.  A childlike joy filled the hearts of all.
Days like this are not just rare.  We have reached the pinnacle of the Kai Moku
Journey.  Now we will wind our way down
the mountain as we spread a little more aloha in Geneva and then on to Lyon to
share some more.
Watch this space…
6 July 2015 – We made it to Geneva.  Thanks to help from JP and his son Michael, the
departure went smoothly from Bristol, England. 
Yesterday, which was Sunday the 5th, we had an early, early
start.  We left JP’s house a little
before 4am.  
The dawn trip through the English countryside was
beautiful.  The farms surrounding Bristol
were just waking up.  The light gave a
gold tint to the crops and windrows shedding precious insight into the spirit
of the land.  Farm homes and out buildings,
many from three, four, and five centuries past, took on a warmth that bespoke
the energy of their people.
JP herded our band of cats through the early morning
crowds.  His experience as a world traveler
shone through – kindness to the harried EasyJet staff was reciprocated with
easy passage for us.  Pat’s arrangement
were again flawless.
Here’s a picture of our row of musicians on the EasyJet
Plane
Martin, our friend from the US Mission in Geneva, met us at
the baggage claim once we landed.  This
was a purely volunteer effort on Martin’s part – he took time away from his
visiting family to greet us.  He took up
JP’s role and used his diplomatic credentials to smooth our way.  Martin, if you recall, is a top notch bass
player.  He and Bully bonded over the
ukulele bass and their preferences in music. 
THANK YOU, Martin!
Soon enough we were rolling through the French countryside
on our way to the home we rented in Segny (“Sig-Knee”).  Sundays are quiet days in rural France.  The only place open for lunch was an American
bistro known throughout the world as McDonalds. 
We munched on French Micky-D food while we waited for the property
manager to open the house.  The food was
good.  I had a goat cheese wrap that was
beyond delicious and the best thing I remember eating at a McDonalds.
The house turned out to be just as amazing as we
imagined.  We quickly divvied up sleeping
space and everyone was comfortable.  The
heat is the only problem.  They had
warned us as we landed that the temperature would be 38.  That’s in degrees C.  Read 99 in degrees F.  Killa.
The view from the house
The temperature came down in the evening, heading for the
mid 20s – 70-ish.  We went out to dinner
at one of the few places open and had a wonderful experience.  With JP speaking French, seemingly fluently,
we had an easy time of picking great menu items and getting great services from
a very friendly staff.  
Here’s a picture of the 282 Bistro
Monday is the start of practice for the BIG DAY.  Weather report says sunny, but HOT, HOT,
HOT.  But it was about 72 at breakfast and we had a beautiful view of the mountains, too.The outdoor event on Tuesday will
likely be in 38+ (100+) degree weather. 
Good thing we’re tough from our hot stage at Paddlers’ Inn on Molokai,
but it sure would have been nice for us to play in typical Geneva summer
weather of 75 and sunny.  Never let a
little thing like that get in the way of a good time, though.

4 July 2015 – Happy Birthday America!  And Happy Birthday Hannah Parsons – JP’s
beautiful granddaughter.  We’re still
staying with Michael and his family in Bristol England.  Here's the house with Pat going in the walk.We have our second gig tonight at the
Victoria Pub.
Here’s a picture of the Victoria Pub, Bully keeping it standing
The owner saw us play at the Duck and almost instantly set
up for us to play the Saturday night crowd at her place.  Here’s the poster she developed (and signed, “with
much love, Rhone”) for us.
Rhona fed us extremely well. 
The food at the Victoria is excellent. 
We had several different entrees among us and everyone loved their
choices.  Here’s a shot of pub food.
Then it was time to play and play we did.  Here’s a shot of DJ, Julia, and Pat getting
settled into the nicely decorated impromptu stage Rhona put together for us.
What a night!  Folks
who had seen us at the Duck started showing up. 
The place packed up.  We already
have Na Ohana Hoaloha groupies in Bristol England!  One couple there was so enthused they invited
us to come back next year to play for their wedding.  Another couple, with the woman due with a
baby girl at any moment, want to visit and consider moving to Hawaii after the
experience.  She even danced the hula
when DJ taught the Hukilau – but threatened to have her baby right then and
there!
4 July 2015 – A day of touring with our intrepid guide, Michael Parsons.  Not only is he an incredible host for our visit to Bristol, he is a brilliant tour guide.  Michael is a highly skilled and qualified buildings expert.  He gave us an amazing perspective on the history of Bristol through its architecture.  
Here is Michael with the Transit Van that JP rented to take us around England



The bridge over the Avon Gorge is truly a wonder.  Designed in 1831, it continues today to link the commercial and residential centers of Bristol.  It is an elegant beauty.  
Here is a picture of the bridge




Michael snapped a shot of us as we posed at the beginning of the bridge walkway.  DJ is on the left, Uncle Herb next, then Pat, Sue, and finally George on the right.At the bridge crossing there is a rock formation that has been worn by use into a very clever slide.  Our host demonstrated his boyish character by sliding down it.  But it was Sue that had requested that we visit it.  We were all stunned as Sue showed the tomboy in her Angel-hula dancer presence and bounced down the rough, rocky slide, worn to shiny by all the little boys’ butts that preceded her.
Here’s a picture of Sue sliding down the cliffs of the Avon Gorge.



We’re off shortly to play our second gig.  I’m excited to be getting ready to head to Geneva, too.
Watch this space!

3 July 2015 – The Black Swan Pub (known to the regulars as
the Dirty Duck, or just the Duck) will never be the same after the hula lesson
and the closing circle.  The Aloha Spirit
was palpable by the end of our performance. 
Here’s video of Sue inspiring the pub crowd to take up hula.
Joining us for the evening was JP’s grandson Joshua.  He got the crowd into sing-along mode with a
hit from the 1960s by the Monkeys called “I’m a Believer”.  Here’s a clip of Joshua leading the crowd in
that song.
The session ended with a request from the audience for two
things – a simple hula that DJ could teach them and for us to sing the song Hukilau.  We combined the two requests and DJ taught
about ten or so folks how to dance the Hukilau while the band played it once
slowly for teaching purposes and then once up to full speed.  What a blast. 
They were quick learners!
The evening ended with a request from the owner of a nearby
pub to play Saturday night at her place. 

More to come…. Watch this space!

2 July 2015 – We’re in England now,
getting ready for our first pub gig.  We
arrived yesterday, about 25 hours from the time we got going on Oahu and more
than 40 hours from the time we left Molokai. 
The whole band was together for the flight across the country and the
Atlantic.  
Here’s our band upon arrival at Heathrow in London



Our Harmonica Player, JP (John Parsons), and his grandson
Joshua (at right in photo above) picked us up in a 14-passenger Transit Van and ferried us to Bristol.  There we were warmly welcomed by Joshua’s
parents, Michael and Natasha, and his sister Hannah.  JP, ever the proud grandpa, shepherded us
around the town.
Here’s the view from the “tower room” at Michael’s home,
where Pat and I found a comfortable bed waiting for our worn and jetlagged
selves.


We spent an hour at the pub where we’ll play tonight.  JP’s friend Chris and a group of pub goers
welcomed us.  The sign out front let
everyone know that tonight (Thursday, July 2) will be Hawaiian night with live
music all the way from the Islands.
Joshua, JP, and Michael fed us a marvelous pasta dinner and
we all retired to sleep off the travel.

30 June 2015 – Aloha Molokai and Hawaii Nei!  





We had a great send off by Shari and the staff of the
Admirals Club in Honolulu.  They are old
friends.  Gotta mention Armie
Pilicara-Woods, who saved our butts on check-in details, but wasn’t there to
see us off.  And to Shari for working her
magic to make seating better than expected.


We’re across the Pacific now, at the LAX Admirals Club.  We took over a corner of the Club and a
friendly French speaking person took a picture of the whole band.



We’re all doing well and in good spirits.

30 June 2015 – We’ll be boarding the plane at Honolulu
International to Heathrow in just a few hours now.  It was an eventful and important day
today.  Pat, Bully, and I left topside
Molokai at about 1:30 pm and began our Kai Moku Journey with a short plane ride
to Kalaupapa, the former Leper Colony and site of the miracles of Saint Damien
and Saint Marianne.  
Kalaupapa comes into
view


The final approach to
the landing strip at Kalaupapa


Here’s a picture of
the three of us at the Kalaupapa airport terminal


The plane from Molokai is a luxurious ride.  We flew Mokulele, one of my favorite airlines
of all time.  Captain Christian and
co-pilot Bonny brought us in on the tiny runway at the edge of the ocean on
this most isolated of peninsulas in the world.

co-pilot Bonny with Pat and Bully in front of their plane

We’re still wrapping up details as I write this.  Bully is resting on the futon in my Kailua
apartment on Oahu – yes, we made it on the first leg of our journey.  


29 June 2015 -- It is official, after our Geneva gigs, we are playing at the Aloha Bar in Lyon, France.  Come join us at 7 pm on 10 July 2015!  It will also be a reception for the American Club of Lyon.  The public is welcome.

28 June 2015 – Frantic, frantic,
frantic.  A million more things to do
before we leave and that is TOMORROW! 
Really, we’re in great shape thanks to Pat’s incredible organizational
skills.  It is more like a million
details to be cleared up, not a million important things to do.  
Pat works here with Julia on tailoring her costume --


The band met again yesterday and went over all of the arrangements.



Everyone flies over to Honolulu tomorrow, Monday, June 29th,
and gets set for the early departure on Tuesday.  We’re all staying with family or friends –
THANK YOU for your continuing support and willingness to get up before dawn to
see us off.  We rendezvous at HNL between
4:45 and 5:00 am on Tuesday morning.  And
then… we’re leaving on a jet plane…
Today is our last regular weekly performance at Paddlers’
Inn before we head into the wild blue yonder. 
We’ve picked out songs from the tour book and we’ll use the performance
as a practice of sorts.  Should be a good
send-off with all of our regulars there to cheer us on.
Bully has been hanging with his other musician friends and
says that they are happy to see us be, as they call it, “ambassadors for
Molokai”.  Thanks, guys, and proud to do
it.
We’re still in pre-release for our CD.  We’ve had some good feedback and I got the CD
into the hands of Derrek Malama, a great DJ who does his “Kanekapila Sunday”
every week on Hawaii Public Radio – great show. 
He’s also the host of Morning Edition on HPR, so you may have heard his
voice if you are an NPR freak like me.  I’m
hoping Derrek likes a few cuts and gives us some air time.  Thanks to Deane Neubauer – regular supporter and
fan of ours – for making the introduction to Derrek.
For you on-line music buyers, we’re up on iTunes now, as
well as CDbaby.  Look for Na
Ohana Hoaloha: LIVE!
Well, time to pull everything together for this
performance.  Aloha no.

22 June 2015 – Things spinning faster
and faster, so many moving parts, but some things are locking down, too.  
Number one best news: the case full of instruments we
shipped to the US Mission in Geneva is there, has passed through customs, and
is now in the trusted hands of Martin The Bass Player (see 17 June entry).  
Number two best news: Na Ohana Hoalaoha: LIVE! is in hand,
including the CD in beautiful DigiPaks, the CDbaby Digital Download Cards for
the diplomats, and our lovely posters.  
Proof that it is real:


We plopped a CD in a few different players and the sound is
GREAT.  Thank you Bully, thank you
DiscMakers.  And for you on-line music
buyers, you’ll be finding the album on Amazon, iTunes, and elsewhere over the
next few days.  
If you want it RIGHT NOW, you can just click over to http://cdbaby.com/cd/naohanahoaloha
We’ve developed our pre-release approach and have a draft of
our launch events in Europe and in the US. 
For those of you who have done this before, we are open to tips on
effective kick-off efforts.
The European launch will, of course, be the July event in
Geneva, were “world-wide distribution” will earn its name.  We will hand CDbaby Digital Download Card of Na Ohana
Hoaloha: LIVE! to representatives
of over 170 nations while they listen to us play.  
The US Launch will take place upon our triumphant return to
Paddlers Inn on Molokai.  We’re
scheduling it for Sunday, July 19th. 
It’s going to be a blast.  We’ll
show videos and photos from our European Tour. 
The State Department will be filming our programs in Geneva and they
have offered to share.  We’ll play a
little of the music, talk story, and soak in the good vibes.
Watch this space!


17 June 2015 – Things are spinning up
pretty fast now.  Our new album, Na
Ohana Hoaloha: LIVE! Launched in digital download form on Sunday and is
available at http://cdbaby.com/cd/naohanahoaloha
and looks great and sounds great.  You can
listen to samplings of the music at that site and buy if you like – one song at
a time or the whole shootin’ match.  
Our instruments shipped from Molokai, headed for Geneva
Switzerland on Tuesday (June 16).  Pat
and George stayed up ‘til past midnight packing the case and doing the shipping
paperwork.  Both talked to Martin in
shipping and receiving at the US Mission to the United Nations in Geneva to
make the arrangements for their receipt. 

So cool, turns out Martin has played bass professionally, so
he was totally understanding of our trepidation at shipping our favorite instruments!  They are slated to arrive in Geneva on June
23rd.  Martin will check them
out and make sure everything is playable. 
We’re much more comfortable having talked to Martin.
Here are two pictures of Martin -- the manager of the shipping and receiving activities at the US Mission in Geneva --  as I said, cool...

            We heard back from our contact at the American Club of Lyon,
France, too.  Lisa, a Vice President of
the Club and an events coordinator, is setting up a reception at the Aloha Bar
in Lyon – can you believe it a Hawaiian themed bar in Lyon France!
Here’s the funny part -- we had checked their Facebook page
and found the Aloha Bar was forced to close on June 9th for
structural repairs to their building.  We
were bummed.  On Sunday the band talked
about offering to do some sort of fundraiser to help them back on their
feet.  But lo, and much to our surprise,
they are already back in business.
So it looks like really cool gigs in three countries – England
(Bristol), Switzerland (Geneva), and France (Lyon).  Still looking for more gigs – retirement center
or something – in Lyon, too.
Watch this space...

14 June 2015 -- The date of the departure from Molokai grows closer.  And closer.   We've locked in virtually all of our travel arrangements now.  Tomorrow we ship our instruments to the US Mission to the UN in Geneva.  The band spent all day yesterday going over progress and plans.


You'll see that ukuleles are in hand.  They are like teddy bears or blankies -- if you remember Linus from the Peanuts gang.  


Virtually every detail of our travel
plans is locked down now – thank you Pat. 
You can see the pages with golden color on them – these are our play
lists for the Geneva performances.  All
of these are locked in now too.
We’ve made a lot of accommodations to reduce the cost of the
trip. One really good example is the
U-bass (an ukulele set up like a bass guitar). We found it costs about ¼ as much to buy Bully
a U-bass than to ship his beautiful Modulus electric bass to and from
Geneva.  Bully is extremely happy with
the new little bass, which sounds just like a stand-up bass when
amplified.  He’s even happier now that we
have installed Aquila “red” strings, like we use on all of our regular
ukuleles.  They have a smooth and gentle
touch.  


Our CD is in the final stages of production at Discmakers
with a ship date of June 16th – this coming Tuesday.  The electronic version of the CD is already
up on CDbaby and will launch on Amazon and iTunes in a week or so.  Check it out -- http://cdbaby.com/cd/naohanahoaloha
and read the album notes on that site.

The Kai Moku Journey Kai Moku means the changing tide in Hawaiian.  With your help, our band, Na Ohana Hoaloha (translation: Family of Friends) will bring a tide of aloha to the international diplomatic community at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland this July.  We are still about $20,000 short of the funds we need to make this a comfortable trip for the band.  Here's how your contribution will help:

Complete the production of our ""Na Ohana Hoaloha: LIVE!"" album to provide a lasting statement of aloha in our songs
Support the logistical needs of the band, which have proven much more costly than estimated
Demonstrate your aloha to the world (and get a PERK if you like)

Please make your contribution on this page -- and you can select a PERK at the same time.

How We Got Here
US Ambassador Pamela Hamamoto in her speech to the US Independence Day celebration last year remarked: ""I thought long and hard about how best to bring the aloha spirit all the way 
from Hawaii, 7,700 miles — or I should say, 12,000 kilometers! – and spread it 
around Geneva, the UN, and all the international organizations. ""  She chose to bring our little band from the island of Molokai, Hawaii, to this year's celebration to do just that.
This is our second campaign to raise funding for Kai Moku.  Our first effort, which closed on May 2nd,  achieved 26% (about $10,000) of our goal of $35,000.  
Over 1,250 people looked at, listened to, and read about Kai Moku  at http://igg.me/at/NOHMKK/x/10072843

  Have a look and find out why they contributed.
We're opening this site to continue our fund raising efforts.  We hope to more than achieve our modest goal, which will allow us to keep the site open into the future.  We plan to share photos, descriptions, and video from the Kai Moku journey as it happens.  But we still need your help.
   Watch the Journey Unfold
 


Recording for the Tour
The band made a commitment to provide a recording of our songs to commemorate the performance for the UN crowd.    Creating and producing that album has been quite an adventure.  For one thing, the CD project has had a name change.  Now it is ""Na Ohana Hoaloha: LIVE!""  We've completed the mixing and mastering, the graphics, and the supporting information and we've reviewed the proofs from our production house: we're on target to deliver the CD in Geneva!
Na
Ohana Hoaloha shifted its CD plan to a set of covers of traditional and
contemporary Hawaiian music.  The new
plan is based on our live program performances recorded every Sunday at Paddler’s
Inn and Restaurant on the island of Molokai.

The Kai Moku Album Notes


Na Ohana Hoaloha: LIVE! … Album Notes on CD Baby:
Take a little trip to
the island of Moloka'i. Na Ohana Hoaloha has drawn well over 10,000 audience
members to its Sunday afternoon performances of Hawaiian music and hula over
the past ten years. Here is your chance to hear some of our great performance
time captured live and in full audio color.
The album opens with a
rousing version of ""Tewe Tewe"", a classic Hawaiian song performed
here in part chant, part chorus. Heavy on the rhythm of the islands, you can
understand, even without knowing the Hawaiian language, that this song about
catching fish isn't just about fishing. Squirming, squirming. Is that about
fish or...
An old song reborn,
the next track is ""Green Rose Hula"". Only Na Ohana Hoaloha can pull
off this combination of rapid guitar work balanced against a cappella runs of
each verse. Harmonies abound.
""Hi'ilawe"",
a classic of the Hawaiian scene, is done here in a version for which beautiful
choreography has been developed by band member and kumu hula (teacher or master
of hula) DJ Pelekai. A warm version or the song, DJ's beautiful voice lets it
paint a picture of the waterfalls at Hi'ilawe while portraying the emotions of
two lovers as they learn of the gossip flying around about them.
""Holoholo""
in Hawaiian is similar to the idea of walkabout in Australia. ""Holoholo
Fun"" is an original song by band member George Benda and was inspired by
his dog Rufus, a Golden Retriever that was the neighborhood dog ambassador.
Rufus had a ""happy dance"" as he walked that is captured in the energy
and bounce of this song.

<br/><b>
What music style do SISTANAGILA play?</b><p>
Our music could be categorised as world music. It is a Fusion of a few<br/>
elements: folk music, improvisation and Jazz.<br/>
We took old Jewish folk music and old Persian folk music and arranged them<br/>
in a modern way. Each musician brought his input to the pieces, so the<br/>
Jewish as well as the Persian pieces are influenced by both cultures- a Fusion.<br/>
In addition we composed new pieces for the ensemble based on Persian and<br/>
Jewish elements.<br/>
<br/><b>
But what do SISTANAGILA need the money for?</b></p>
<p>
We decided not to go for a small home-made production, since we want to<br/>
reach as many people as possible and offer a high level product. <br/>
We chose the 2 time Echo (German Grammy) winner Studio <a href=""http://www.lowswing.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lowswing</a> located in<br/>
Berlin.</p>
<p>
Recording in a professional studio is expensive and then comes the editing<br/>
of the music and  the mixing. After the CD is finished, we will need to create the booklet with a professional graphic artist, print the CDs, send it to you and of course pay indiegogo their percentage.</p>

Sistanagila is a music group consisting of Iranian
and Israeli Musicians
based in Berlin Germany. 
We communicate through music. **** Even though we understand we will not reach our goal, we promise we will record the CD in any case. We will gain more funding through our concerts and make pre-odrering lists for CDs. We will make this happen! Sistanagila*****
The project is a reaction to the negative messages spread by both
governments and demonstrates that there is an alternative to hatred and fear, an authentic voice.

We have been playing concerts all around Germany in the last 2 years and are
now going towards our next goal- recording our first CD.

That's where we need you. If you order a CD now we both get something from
it, we get the funding to record the CD, you get a CD with our music.

If you feel like being a bigger supporter just choose a reward from the
rewards on the right or fill in a free different amount in the donation field.
Any donation is accepted gives us a warm feeling in our heart knowing that
people stand behind this idea. 
Please forward this website to your friends and colleagues. We can not do this alone we need your help!



What music style do SISTANAGILA play?
Our music could be categorised as world music. It is a Fusion of a few
elements: folk music, improvisation and Jazz.
We took old Jewish folk music and old Persian folk music and arranged them
in a modern way. Each musician brought his input to the pieces, so the
Jewish as well as the Persian pieces are influenced by both cultures- a Fusion.
In addition we composed new pieces for the ensemble based on Persian and
Jewish elements.

But what do SISTANAGILA need the money for?

We decided not to go for a small home-made production, since we want to
reach as many people as possible and offer a high level product. 
We chose the 2 time Echo (German Grammy) winner Studio Lowswing located in
Berlin.

Recording in a professional studio is expensive and then comes the editing
of the music and  the mixing. After the CD is finished, we will need to create the booklet with a professional graphic artist, print the CDs, send it to you and of course pay indiegogo their percentage.

For English text click hereSistanagila ist ein iranisch-israelisches Ensemble aus Berlin. Das Projekt ist eine Reaktion auf die feindselige und kriegstreiberische
Rhetorik der Regierungen und möchte damit eine Alternative zu aktuellen von Hass
erfüllten Spannungen präsentieren, eine authentische Stimme auf Grundlage einer
künstlerischen Zusammenarbeit.
Wir sind seit zwei Jahren aktiv und haben in dieser Zeit zahlreiche
Konzerte in ganz Deutschland mit großem Erfolg absolviert. Jetzt stehen wir vor
unserem nächsten Ziel und wollen unsere erste CD aufnehmen.
Und hier brauchen wir EUCH. Wenn IHR eine CD bestellt, haben wir beide
etwas davon: wir können unsere CD aufnehmen und IHR bekommt die CD mit unserer
Musik.
Wenn IHR denkt, dass ihr unser Fan werden und damit auch diese Idee unterstützen
möchtet, wählt einfach eines unserer Dankeschön-Pakete auf der rechten Seite
aus. (hier clicken um die Pakete zu sehen)
Ihr könnt natürlich auch einfach einen Betrag im
Spende-Feld eintragen.
Jede Spende wird gerne angenommen und lässt uns mit einem warmen Gefühl in
unserem Herzen wissen, dass Menschen hinter dieser Idee stehen.
Bitte leitet diese Website an eure Freunde und Kollegen weiter. Wir

Was ist der Musikstil von SISTANAGILA?

Es ist eine Fusion von verschiedenen Elementen aus

Darüber hinaus haben wir zusammen neue Stücke basierend auf Persischen und Jüdischen Elementen für das Ensemble komponiert.
Aber wofür braucht SISTANAGILA das ganze Geld?
Wir haben uns entschieden, keine kleine hausgemachte Produktion zu machen,
weil wir die Menschen auf der ganzen Welt erreichen und denen ein qualitatives
Produkt anbieten wollen.
Deswegen haben wir uns für das Studio Lowswing in Berlin entschieden, das
schon zweimal mit seinen Produktionen den Echo erhalten hat.
Eine Aufnahme in einem hochprofessionellen Studio ist teuer und dann kommt
noch die Bearbeitung der Musik und die Abmischung dazu.Nachdem die CD fertig ist, möchten wir
das Booklet von einem professionellen Grafiker gestalten lassen, die CDs
drucken und den Anteil von Indiegogo bezahlen.

Und dann schicken wir Ihnen
unsere neue CD zu!

<h3>Tell us about the songs!</h3>
<p>The song selections on <strong>Just For Once </strong>range in style from adult contemporary to acoustic, from ""old school"" R&amp;B to ""straight ahead"" jazz. There are well-known songs ""reimagined,"" some performed just as you would expect them, and underexposed songs that are dear to my heart.   There are songs about the many ways we experience love, about intimacy and connection, about reminiscence, and about celebrating what lasts and really matters.</p>
<p>Who better to sing about those things than someone who's been around the block a few times! </p>
<p>All kidding aside, these are songs that I have had a deep desire to sing for a long time and that resonate deeply within me. Your financial support of <strong>Just For Once </strong>will allow me to fulfill my lifelong dream of recording and, in return, give you a captivating musical work that you can enjoy for a lifetime.  </p>
<p>Those of you who know me as a performer have been waiting for me to record for many years, and I can't thank you enough for your continued support and encouragement.  Knowing that I will be able to create this beautiful work for you with such a gifted team is beyond description. </p>
<h3>The Impact of Your Support</h3>
<p>Your financial support of <strong>Just For Once </strong>will allow me to do 5 important things with this recording that I couldn't afford to do on my own:</p>
<p>1.  I'll be able to record in a professional studio with experienced session musicians.</p>
<p>2. I'll be able to have Grammy nominated arranger/pianist John di Martino involved in the entire production and recording process.  John is one of the most sought after accompanists working today, because of his ability to musically ""shapeshift"" to any style required.  We also have a fantastic working chemistry, so having him as the musical director assures that the arrangements and final production will beautifully reflect my artistic vision.</p>
<p>3.  I will be able to continue my coaching relationship with Claude McKnight, founder and lead tenor of  10 time Grammy award winning vocal group Take 6.  Over the summer, Claude has helped me broaden the scope of my vocal interpretation palette. I'm very pleased with the results and his continued input over the course of the recording will be invaluable.</p>
<p>4.  Graphic designer extraordinaire (and dear friend) Robert Wale will be able to fully invest in creating the CD artwork so that it looks as beautiful on the outside as the music inside.</p>
<p>5.  I will have sufficient funds to include special guest musicians to add the perfect nuances to each song.</p>
</div>
<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Bottom Line:</span></h3>
<p><i><strong>I need to raise $3500 to accomplish Phase I of Just For Once</strong></i>.***</p>
<p><u>Phase I</u>  includes writing the arrangements and rehearsing with John di Martino,  and vocal coaching with Claude McKnight in September/October 2016.</p>
<p><i><strong>Next, I'll need $6500 for Phase II!</strong></i></p>
<p><u>Phase II </u>includes rehearsing and recording with John di Martino and session musicians, rehearsal space rental and recording studio costs</p>
<p><strong><i>Later, I will need another $10,000 to proceed to Phase II and complete the album</i></strong></p>
<p><u>Phase II</u> includes adding guest artists and final vocal dubs, getting the album mixed and mastered, cover art and website design, and the printing of the final product!  But that's another campaign :)</p>
<h3>Perks!</h3>
<p>I so enjoyed coming up with special ways to say THANK YOU for enabling me to make this recording,  There's a contribution level for EVERY budget!</p>
<p>I'll write a personal thank you note to each of you for helping to make this dream come true. There are autographed photos and CDs, as well as VIP tickets for the CD Release Parties.  Every contribution of $100 or more will be acknowledged in the release event programs.</p>
<p>Those of you who support at the $5000, $10,000 or $20,000 level become ""Producers"" and receive a very exciting perk! In addition to acknowledgement on the CD cover and a front row table at one of the CD Release Parties, John di Martino and I will come to your home for a private house concert for you and your guests (In CT/NYC area - other locations may require additional travel and/or lodging expenses).</p>
</div><ul></ul><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks and challenges associated with this project are minimal, as we can schedule the recording process around our other commitments and take our time to do it well.  The only challenge is raising sufficient funding to complete the project. </p>

From church toddler's choir at three, to rocking the recorder in 4th grade, and to picking up my first guitar in 6th, music has, and always will be, a staple in my life.  Over the last few years, songwriting has become a serious passion of mine - it is my safe haven. When I am confused, when I am overjoyed, when I am depressed, when I am searching for an answer, or a more clear head about something - I'll start writing. Music helps people heal, and it helps people think - what an amazing thing.</p>
<p>I've compiled fifteen of the dozens of songs I've written over the last couple of years, and it's time to get these recorded, and start making my dreams come to fruition.</p>
<p>The official title of the album is... </p>
<blockquote><b><i>""IN SEARCH OF CERTAINTY""</i></b></blockquote>
<p>...and to make this happen, I certainly need your help.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>I need to raise funds to pay for the recording/production of this album. I have the studio space, the time, and an amazing sound engineer that I will be working with to make everything sound great. This money will also go into not only recording the album, but producing physical copies of the album and the artwork, along with other promotional items. </div>
<div>Listed to the side are perks that come along with your generous donations. Check em' out! </div> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>This is my dream - to record and share the music that I pour my heart, mind, and soul into. With your donations, this will be possible!</p>
<p>This is also an extremely opportune time to record this album. I am a rising senior Acting Major at Webster University's Conservatory of Theatre, and will be graduating in 2016. At the end of the year, I will be traveling to New York City and Los Angeles to audition for and meet with casting/talent agents in two of the most booming entertainment cities in the world. With this album under my belt and ready to present to them, who knows who's hands it could get into, and what leap that could make for my career? It's not an easy lifestyle that I'm getting myself into as an Actor/Singer/Songwriter, but it is undeniably what I feel called to do. It has always been my dream and passion - it's time to chase it full force. Your donations will help me do so.</p>
<p>Also, I plan on performing a concert at which all of the proceeds from ticket sales and album purchases will go towards getting my Senior Performance Class of 2016 to Los Angeles. Having this album available for purchase will make this possible!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I'm a broke college student. The only hurdle to get over in this process is the moolah $$$. The songs are written, the studio is ready, and the time is now. I just have to pay for it! </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help!</p>
<p>Share this page on social media as often as you can throughout the campaign! Forward it to people who you know may be interested!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i><b>Every penny helps, people, and I will be eternally grateful for each and every donation. Also, due to the nature of the PERKS, we could potentially be make some MORE art in the process. That's pretty awesome. </b></i></p>

From church toddler's choir at three, to rocking the recorder in 4th grade, and to picking up my first guitar in 6th, music has, and always will be, a staple in my life.  Over the last few years, songwriting has become a serious passion of mine - it is my safe haven. When I am confused, when I am overjoyed, when I am depressed, when I am searching for an answer, or a more clear head about something - I'll start writing. Music helps people heal, and it helps people think - what an amazing thing.
I've compiled fifteen of the dozens of songs I've written over the last couple of years, and it's time to get these recorded, and start making my dreams come to fruition.
The official title of the album is... 
""IN SEARCH OF CERTAINTY""
...and to make this happen, I certainly need your help.   What I Need & What You Get
I need to raise funds to pay for the recording/production of this album. I have the studio space, the time, and an amazing sound engineer that I will be working with to make everything sound great. This money will also go into not only recording the album, but producing physical copies of the album and the artwork, along with other promotional items. 
Listed to the side are perks that come along with your generous donations. Check em' out!  The Impact
 This is my dream - to record and share the music that I pour my heart, mind, and soul into. With your donations, this will be possible!
This is also an extremely opportune time to record this album. I am a rising senior Acting Major at Webster University's Conservatory of Theatre, and will be graduating in 2016. At the end of the year, I will be traveling to New York City and Los Angeles to audition for and meet with casting/talent agents in two of the most booming entertainment cities in the world. With this album under my belt and ready to present to them, who knows who's hands it could get into, and what leap that could make for my career? It's not an easy lifestyle that I'm getting myself into as an Actor/Singer/Songwriter, but it is undeniably what I feel called to do. It has always been my dream and passion - it's time to chase it full force. Your donations will help me do so.
Also, I plan on performing a concert at which all of the proceeds from ticket sales and album purchases will go towards getting my Senior Performance Class of 2016 to Los Angeles. Having this album available for purchase will make this possible!
    Risks & Challenges I'm a broke college student. The only hurdle to get over in this process is the moolah $$$. The songs are written, the studio is ready, and the time is now. I just have to pay for it! 
    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help!
Share this page on social media as often as you can throughout the campaign! Forward it to people who you know may be interested!

Every penny helps, people, and I will be eternally grateful for each and every donation. Also, due to the nature of the PERKS, we could potentially be make some MORE art in the process. That's pretty awesome. 
I will keep you updated on the process of the funding and the recording. I want you all to feel like you're a part of this - and you are with your donations and support. Let's make an album, y'all!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<p><i>Tenor Nathan Granner, a renowned solo and collaborative artist, has a “vibrant and flexible” voice (The Boston Globe) and “possesses utter control of a ravishing mixed head sound.” (Opera News) Mr. Granner uses his voice in a variety of artistic and expressive styles, ranging from opera to jazz and classical cross-over performances. As an opera singer, Mr. Granner has performed as Nemorino in L'elisir d'amore, Ferrando in Cosí fan tutte, and Rodolfo in La Bohéme in performances with Lyric Opera Kansas City, Opera Theater of St. Louis, Tulsa Opera, Wolf Trap and Glimmerglass Opera. In the crossover realm, he is a founding member of The American Tenors, whose Sony Masterworks album reached top five in the classical crossover charts. </i></p>

<li>work in the field of opera</li>
<li>work in the music industry (Film and Television) in the Los Angeles market</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In order to do that, as an opera singer and as an industry professional I have to work my way (back) in to the these communities<ul>

<li>trade magazine, catalogue and social media promotion</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This campaign begins the ride to getting on the professional opera stage again. It doesn't happen overnight, but it has to begin somewhere. This is a really great opportunity right out of the gate to work with two great companies and great people.</p>
<p>This for me is a really big deal in getting my name out there for the remainder of this audition season on the national scene. </p>
<p>I am needing some help getting from Los Angeles to New York. It's Labor Day pricing on the airlines and with transitioning to the Los Angeles area I am challenged to get enough funds to fly.</p>
</div><div>
<p>This particular request is very much a surprise and something of an artistic emergency. I will do a proper campaign in the next month to dig into some really cool things I have planned. </p>

<li>Individual Recordings</li>
<li>Digital Technology Devices which cannot be mentioned here, but are in prototype stage</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a really important part in my development as an artist. I am at the point where I am singing better than I ever have. If my voice and talent were meant to be on the stage and heard through your speakers and headphones, this would be the time to make it happen.<br/><br/>I've been doing this for a long time now and cannot thank you enough for your previous and your continued support to help my career along in the times when I truly need help the most. Over and over I get people who come up to me or write me and say how much my music has meant to them, or how many times they've played a CD or listened to some of my albums. I truly think there is more and BETTER on the way! I need you now to light that little spark.</p>
</div><div><p>While this is all true, I have to say there is risk here. This proposal is for a couple of auditions. There are no guarantees that an audition will lead to an immediate role. What it will do though is put my voice and talent in front of people who have the power to cast and also who are truly leaders in the larger opera community. Maybe not today, but tomorrow the interest will come to a head. Still, I'm very confident in a great showing and the prospects look REALLY GREAT... for this leg and into the near future.</p></div><div>

<p>Just forward the word along and send folks to the myriad places where my music exists. <a href=""http://nathangranner.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://nathangranner.com</a> for example! :)<br/><br/>Also there is a share button.

<h3>Hello!  </h3>

<h3>Who I Am // Where I Come From</h3>
<p>My name is Batya Levine. I grew up in a Modern Orthodox home, where Shabbos meant sourdough challah on the table and singing <i>nigunim </i>(wordless melodies) into the night. I’m a lover of groove, a student of the heart, and a pun enthusiast. I care about building Jewish community that simultaneously reaches backward and forward in time, and is wide enough for our whole selves. </p> <p>I’ve been coming into my own music practice over the last four years, getting to know my voice and learning to let songs move through me. Many of you have been in it with me along the way, loving and supporting my music, and are the reason I’ve come to this moment. THANK YOU!</p> <h3>Why This Album?</h3>
<p>This album is a collection of the music that has come through this queer Jewish <i>neshama</i> (soul). It’s made of Ashkenazi yearning, heartache, and <i>emunah</i> (trust/faith). There are songs that incoporate liturgy<i>, nigun</i>, dance parties with the divine, and english heart-prayers. <strong>This music weaves together the rooted <i>ruach</i> (spirit) and tradition of my upbringing with the expansive and empowering spaces I currently call home. </strong>It is an offering back to the Jewish musical landscape that has nourished and held me through so much.</p>
<p>Singing and the power of music has been used across cultures for healing and connection throughout time. <strong>And in a world that is burning, we need each other and we need to keep singing: singing the music of our ancestors and the music of right now.</strong></p>
<p>It helps us tune in, so that we can feel into our hope, our grief, our longing, and our celebration. </p> <h3>Where you come in!</h3>
<p>This album will take the work of so many, and I want to honor the labor and care of all those involved. While it feels vulnerable to raise $18,000 (!!) for an album of my original music, what that number actually means is compensating a number of musicians, artists, and engineers in ways that strive to reflect the value of their time, energy, and gifts.</p>
<p>So, this fundraising isn’t just for the music: it goes towards compensating the work of artists who are creating and organizing for a more just and connected world. </p> <h3>Batya’s Album Team:</h3>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who am I?</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Roman Wróblewski and I'm a polish pianist with classical training. I am playing piano since 1991 when I was a 6 years old kid, full of dreams and hopes. Nothing really changed and, as you can see, I am still kind of a dreamer. During my last 15 years of stage presence, I was involved in many different music projects. From punk rock bands, reggae, dub, experimental, pop to electronic music, I was always searching for new ways of self expression. I've recorded 10 studio albums and played hundreds of concerts in Europe and Asia, but I have never recorded an album with my own piano music. Now, after one year of hard work, I hope to finish my debut album with your support.</p>

<p>Every euro generated will go into the album release, no matter what the campaign brings in. The money will not be used for personal needs under any circumstances.  </p>
<p>You can support the release of my album by choosing from many different perks. There is a simple pre-order option where you can choose between digital downloads, CDs, and 180-gram, high-quality crafted vinyl.</p>
<p>Two of my artist friends created very special artworks, inspired by my music. For music lovers, I offer online piano lessons and my 10 years of experience in this field.

Not only for me… I believe that music is much more, something we all need at times and as Pythagoras said: “Music is a harmonization of opposites; reconciliation of the fighting elements ”. This strong faith continues to guide me through my life. On my way, I met many amazing people and spent special moments with the audience.

Skoro to czytacie to chyba za dużo się u mnie nie zmieniło. Podczas moich ostatnich 15 lat obecności na scenie jestem zaangażowany w wiele muzycznych projektów. Od punk rocka, reggae, dub, muzyki eksprymentalnej, popu aż do muzyki elektronicznej, zawsze w poszukiwaniu nowych form ekspresji. Nagrałem 10 płyt studyjnych oraz zagrałem wiele koncertów w Europie i Azji, ale mimo to nigdy nie udało mi się nagrać swojej solowej płyty z muzyką fortepianową. Teraz, po roku ciężkiej pracy, mam nadzieje dokończyć mój debiutancki album, ale potrzebuje do tego waszego wsparcia.</p>

<p>W grudniu 2019, po bardzo długich dwóch dniach w Studiu Radia Gdańsk, skończyłem nagrania wszystkich 8 kompozycji. Wszystkie ślady miałem przyjemność nagrywać na świetnie brzmiącym fortepianie marki Steinway. Następnie, po wielu miesiącach poszukiwań znalazłem wszystkie potrzebne osoby do tego by zrobić ten album czymś więcej niż tylko nagraniami fortepianiu. Cały zespół tych osób składa się z dwóch utalentowanych grup tancerzy i producentów filmowych, z którymi już pracuje nad produkcją dwóch video klipów, zdolnej graficzki, która zajmie się całością okładki i indentyfikacji wizualnej oraz fotografa, który zrobi profesjonalną sesję zdjęciową. Wasze wsparcie jest kluczowe także by móc opłacić koszta związane z marketingiem, PR-em oraz cyfrową dystrybucją, co jest bardzo ważne jeżeli moja muzyka ma dotrzeć do większego grona odbiorców.</p>

<p>Po wielu latach bycia niezależnym artystą, tworzeniu oraz graniu własnej muzyki, muszę powiedzieć jedno: to nie jest łatwe. Cały czas wierzę w muzykę i ostatnie kilka miesięcy były wielkim sprawdzianem dla tej wiary. Nie tylko z resztą dla mnie... Wierzę że muzyka to coś więcej, coś czego wszyscy często potrzebujemy oraz jak powiedział Pitagoras: ""Muzyka jest harmonizacją przeciwieństw; pojednaniem walczących elementów"". Ta silna wiara wciąż prowadzi mnie przez życie. Na mojej drodzę poznałem wiele wspaniałych ludzi oraz dzieliłem wiele wzniosłych momentów z publicznością. Jako artysta staram się zwyczajnie być użytecznym narzędziem, dzielić się z Wami całym swoim talentem oraz szerzyć harmonie wśród innych. Mam nadzieje że przy Twoim wsparciu, uda mi się robić to nadal, z jeszcze większą mocą!</p>

Możesz wesprzeć wydanie tej płyty poprzez zakup jednej z wielu różnych cegiełek (opisy w języku angielskim). Istnieje najprostsza opcja zakupu pre-orderu w trzech różnych wariantach: cyfrowej, płyty CD oraz 180-gramowego, wysokiej jakości winyla.
Ponadto dwójka moich przyjaciół z Lizbony przygotowała specjalne dzieła sztuki w postaci limitowanej edycji obrazu oraz trzech pocztówek z cytatami moich ulubionych pisarzy. Dla pasjonatów muzyki istnieje opcja zakupu lekcji pianina w wersji online i skorzystanie z mojego 10-letniego doświadczenia w nauczaniu. Istnieje też opcja zamówienia utworu fortepianowego, który od zera stworzę dla Ciebie. Poza tym możecie w ramach wsparcia albumu, zamówić prywatny koncert w wersji online lub na żywo.



Gdzie dokładnie idą wasze pieniądze?
W grudniu 2019, po bardzo długich dwóch dniach w Studiu Radia Gdańsk, skończyłem nagrania wszystkich 8 kompozycji. Wszystkie ślady miałem przyjemność nagrywać na świetnie brzmiącym fortepianie marki Steinway. Następnie, po wielu miesiącach poszukiwań znalazłem wszystkie potrzebne osoby do tego by zrobić ten album czymś więcej niż tylko nagraniami fortepianiu. Cały zespół tych osób składa się z dwóch utalentowanych grup tancerzy i producentów filmowych, z którymi już pracuje nad produkcją dwóch video klipów, zdolnej graficzki, która zajmie się całością okładki i indentyfikacji wizualnej oraz fotografa, który zrobi profesjonalną sesję zdjęciową. Wasze wsparcie jest kluczowe także by móc opłacić koszta związane z marketingiem, PR-em oraz cyfrową dystrybucją, co jest bardzo ważne jeżeli moja muzyka ma dotrzeć do większego grona odbiorców.



Zadania, trudności oraz wyzwania...
Po wielu latach bycia niezależnym artystą, tworzeniu oraz graniu własnej muzyki, muszę powiedzieć jedno: to nie jest łatwe. Cały czas wierzę w muzykę i ostatnie kilka miesięcy były wielkim sprawdzianem dla tej wiary. Nie tylko z resztą dla mnie... Wierzę że muzyka to coś więcej, coś czego wszyscy często potrzebujemy oraz jak powiedział Pitagoras: ""Muzyka jest harmonizacją przeciwieństw; pojednaniem walczących elementów"". Ta silna wiara wciąż prowadzi mnie przez życie. Na mojej drodzę poznałem wiele wspaniałych ludzi oraz dzieliłem wiele wzniosłych momentów z publicznością. Jako artysta staram się zwyczajnie być użytecznym narzędziem, dzielić się z Wami całym swoim talentem oraz szerzyć harmonie wśród innych. Mam nadzieje że przy Twoim wsparciu, uda mi się robić to nadal, z jeszcze większą mocą!


Jak inaczej możesz jeszcze pomóc?
Niektórzy ludzie nie mogą udzielić finansowego wsparcia, ale to nie znaczy że nie mogą pomóc. Możesz podzielić się z innymi informacją o tej kampanii i wesprzeć to wydawnictwo w ten sposób. Poprzez post na Twojej stronie social mediów lub zwyczajną rozmowę, możesz wesprzeć mnie i zrealizować razem ze mną moję debiutancką płytę.

<h3>Welcome </h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Erica. I am an improvisational singer and therapist in training. The first time I tried singing what I like to call ""a now song,"" rather than something previously written, my whole being came alive. The feeling of being right on the edge of creation, literally singing alive something fresh and new in real time is what gets me out of bed in the morning. I always prefer singing ""now songs,"" and meeting the moment with my heart and voice. It's no wonder that I am also in the healing arts world. The more I sing, and the more I deepen in my studies of Pre &amp; Perinatal Birth Psychology, I see how therapeutic sound and music truly are. Your contributions will allow me to bring forth the music I carry and share it with the world at large. </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get </h3>
<p>I need $6,500 for recording, mixing, and mastering this 5 track album, traveling to my producers, distributing the album, designing album art, marketing and promoting the album, creating a music video (woop woop!), and accounting for taxes and fees from fundraising platforms. </p>
<p>You, my dear, will get to receive the sweet nectar of the songs that pour forth from my heart to yours; designed to soothe, calm, and bring you ever closer to your essence.♡ </p>
<p>Any and all donations, at any amount mean so much to me and truly make this dream possible! </p>
<h3>My 'Why' </h3>
<p>This project is so important to me because I see that many of us have not learned the tools to self-regulate our nervous systems. If I could help, even just one person feel connected to themselves and sense of calm through the songs that are ready to be born, I would know that I'm living my mission. </p>
<p>I have already received an abundance of incredible feedback from my single, 'Welcome In,' released in February of 2021. People are saying that 'Welcome In' has given them the permission they longed for to be with all the parts of themselves. Go listen to it and see for yourself! </p>

<p>This campaign is intended to raise money to fund the production costs associated with producing my full length album and to help people find hope in their lives.

<ul>
<li>Equipment costs/rentals</li>
<li>Mastering</li>
<li>CD, Vinyl replication</li>
<li>Digital Distribution Fees</li>
<li>Web Hosting</li>
<li>The list goes on!</li>

<h3>What is<i> Job's Trials?</i>
</h3>
<p>This new work explores the powerful and timeless themes from The Book of Job. Job’s questioning of justice and his resolve to rise in resistance while holding on to his faith are essential lessons to all of us as we confront the issues that face our society and the world.  This music aims to bring new audiences to this important story and to give those familiar with it a unique and modern vantage point on an ancient story containing themes that are still vitally important to our time.</p>
<p><i>Job’s Trials</i> uses a unique new format based on a classical song cycle recast using the passionate language of jazz amplified with theatrical narration. The performance examines the most perplexing and powerful themes from the story: the paradox of faith, the ephemeral value of a virtuous life and the injustice of suffering. The narrative is propelled forward by the questions and themes that emerge from the text.</p>
<p>This work aims to leave listeners with a desire to fearlessly examine the difficult questions in their life and perhaps to begin to stand up to them with a deeper sense of courage and faith. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where We Are. And Where We Are Going.</h3>
<p>This project is funded up through the last day of recording. Amazing! ... but of course the production after recording is where most of the cost of album-making lies. We still need the funding to mix, master, design, reproduce, distribute and promote the recording. </p>
<p>We aim to bring this music to spaces of faith to amplify, deepen and challenge the traditional reading of this powerful story. Furthermore this recording will help to bring this universal theme to secular spaces as a potent model for resistance and endurance.</p>
<p>We would love your support as an early adopter. If you have read this far you are interested, right?? Please support by pre-ordering a CD, beautiful vinyl or signing on for a elite supporter package.</p>

<h3>Who We Are? </h3>
<p>A.R.A.P. (Aspiring Rap Artists Program) was created in 2016 to inspire the youth to learn how to express themselves in ways not often available to them. There's a lack of artistic opportunities available in the community. The company provides a comfortable setting and atmosphere for artists as they grow. Within the past year, getting the youth involved in our activities has been an enjoyable experience and many have been impressed on how superb and  contemporary the program has been. This campaign is to raise money for copyrighting the curriculum, contributors will help us achieve our goal in owning our curriculum to teach the youth. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get?</h3>
<p>ARAP's goal is to have $1,000. We are investing it into the copyright's for our curriculum. This is a significant requisition for teaching kids for the workshop. We've piloted our workshop several times, now we need a full curriculum that is copy-written before we launch the full program. Even if we don't reach our $1,000 goal, the curriculum will still be apart of the investment. A reward to whoever donates to the cause will receive a video from Traiquan and Abdul spitting 16 bars, or if we get to teach kids this summer, we will have a video of them saying ""thank you"" and also showing the progress we'll be doing in class.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What makes us stand out the most to our primary consumers is our determined objective in facilitating to the children how to spread substance through the art form of rap. Rap is a form of urban literature that some of us we listen to, can relate to, and can identify with regardless of your background. We have created a comfortable setting for our students to embrace their individuality and expressions through their own lyrics. We build a strong relationship with our students through communication and interaction within the class. Students will learn how to uplift and support one another and respect each other's creativity, in and out of the classroom.</p>
<ul><li>ARAP received 2 grants as well as piloted the workshop at both Edwards Middle School in Charlestown and The Mattapan Teen Center. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With recent art funding cuts of 55% in Massachusetts, it is becoming more difficult for the art community to provide opportunities, such as ARAP, to the youth. </p>

Aspire to Inspire Our four members have been writing and playing music for a long time. Some of us have solo projects, but we have all been looking for a group of passionate and committed musicians to establish a steady band. Lucid City was formed in hopes of creating a lifetime experience that could potentially transcend ourselves and inspire the world around us. We aspire to inspire.    Risks & Challenges Our biggest current challenge is aligning our perspective lives to coincide with our passion of music. The four of us work very hard, some of us are also in school, and we each make it a point to dedicate and allocate time to create. Time presents a challenge for us -- not allowing us to play as many shows as we like, busk, and generate income with our music. Therefore, we turned to crowd funding. We hope our friends and families will give what they can to catalyze the birth of our projects!

<p>Goto80 (Anders Carlsson) is a Swedish old media artist and researcher who works with music and text. His live shows are usally an explosion of genres, seamlessly mixing pop, acid, electro and punk together in his own particular 8-bit style. Catchy, noisy, funky and fearless.</p>
<p>After his 1990's schooling in the demoscene hacker culture, he was one of the first to bring chip music to the stage around 2000. He has performed around the world and released thousands of songs for free download, on C64-cartridge, in cheese burgers, in the wall of the Museum of the Moving Image in New York, etcetera.</p>
<p>As an artist he usually takes a critical look at how humans and computers interact, and has shown his work at Transmediale and Aars Electronica. In his Dataslav-project he creates music live, based on requests from the audience. When he makes ASCII graffiti he turns himself into a cursor who sprays text characters on walls.</p>
<p>As a researcher he has published texts about chip music and the demoscene at Ashgate and Rhizome. Currently he studies collective retro archiving together with associate professor Jörgen Skågeby, and writes books and papers about text graphics. Goto80 also curates t3xtm0de, an archive of text graphics, and blogs at Chipflip. </p>

<p>In the last 9 years I have been recording 5 Cds and realized that this music is touching so many people all over the world. My last album 'Lullabies for the soul' was recorded and produced in England by my dear friend Nick Barber together with Camille Marie a wonderful musician and harp player and got released in 2011.  People have been asking me in the last year when there will be a new one.

<p>Bettina Maureenji has been travelling through Central and South America, Asia, Australia, Israel, England and Europe for the last 14 years.

She worked for many years in the music business being educated in organization management and administration. During a journey to Varanasi (India) in 2003 she decided to devote her life to music and began to study Indian Classical Music with Pandith Shivanat Mishra at Benares Music Academy. She discovered her love for singing and using her voice as her main instrument and developed her own style in contemporary sitar playing.</p>

<p>Bettina Maureenjis encounter with the Brazilian musician Carioca Freitas in 1999 and the studies with her sitar guruji Pandit Shivnat Mishra in India, has influenced her very own musical language.</p>

<i><b>Biography Narayan Dass </b></i><p></p>
<p>Narayan picked up a guitar in 2013 after meeting Bettina in a sacred prayer circle where she was supporting with music.

</div></div>","I have always known that my life is about inner growth, healing and transformation and I have chosen music and song as a  tool to support my self on this path. This journey has been sprinkled with intense challenges but they transformed them selves into gifts. 

www.maureenji.com

Life is constantly gifting me with the pleasure of meeting so many special people and beings. I have been able to travel around the globe sitting and singing in some of the most beautiful places. My devotion to sacred space and song has been inspired by all of you! 
https://maureenji.bandcamp.com/music
In the last 9 years I have been recording 5 Cds and realized that this music is touching so many people all over the world. My last album 'Lullabies for the soul' was recorded and produced in England by my dear friend Nick Barber together with Camille Marie a wonderful musician and harp player and got released in 2011.  People have been asking me in the last year when there will be a new one. I have written and composed for the last 2 years listening to the new vibration within my heart and trying to capture it.
It is a sweet duty to feel to be in service to deliver this music to support people on their path of transformation because this music has been delivered to me to support my own journey. 
I feel very grateful to have met Narayan and that he fell in love with these songs and that he is willing to create this new album together with me. 
Thank you all for participating in this project and co creating this album together. Because I am not a signed musician with a record label in the back it is the community of all of us financing this new CD. You can do this by simply pre ordering the new album for $15 and if you feel to donate more you can do that as well.
My love to all of you.

<p>However, with hard work and despite the distance, we've managed to put together our best work to date. After reuniting for the first time in years to record the songs, we've gotten a hold of <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/david-barbe-mn0000631605/credits"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">David Barbe</a> and <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/harris-newman-mn0000668051/credits"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Harris Newman</a>, two post-producers who have worked with notable bands that have been very influential to us.

<p>While we've covered much of our budget ourselves already, we need help closing the gap and completing this project. Whatever you decide to donate will go towards:</p>

<li>Shipping charges to send the tape to Montreal, CA</li>

<p>The most important result of all of this work is that people listen to the album! So, anybody who contributes any amount to our campaign will be sent a digital copy of the album as soon as it's done.</p>

<p>Since we've already finished recording the album, and have already booked time with both producers, the risks for this project are relatively low.

<h3>     The reason we're so excited is this: The Extreme Tour is not about music. It's not about gaining exposure/building a career, and it's not about making money. In fact, it's only by the grace of God working through generous donors that this cause is even possible. Every year, a staff of 30 or so unpaid volunteers organize tours that take place both in the US and internationally. So what is the Extreme Tour all about? It's about reaching youth who desperately need to hear the message of Christ. The tool used to do that? Music. However, we've been instructed to think of this tour as more of a Mission Trip than a ""music tour"", and that's what it is. Check out theextremetour.com for more information on the tour itself.</h3>
<h3>     The point of this fund raiser is this: we can only do this with additional financial support. Without putting ourselves in debt, we need the help of fellow Christians who believe this to be a worthy cause. Fortunately, a good portion of our food and lodging will be taken care of by the Extreme Tour. Gas will need to be paid for by us. In addition, we won't be making money on the road aside from merchandise sales. So, even in a best case scenario, we'll be going into August having lost significant income that we could have made had we stayed home. From a worldly perspective, a venture like this doesn't make sense. There's little to gain for us. There's no money to be made. But we, along with everyone involved in this cause, aren't just musicians. Like many of you reading this, we are warriors for the kingdom. We are servants of the Lord. We will go where God leads us to serve his people. </h3>
<h3>     With everything accounted for, our goal is $5000. However, if we don't reach our goal, we won't be worried. As He always does, our God will provide. If you feel called to help us out with any gift large or small, please do. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us!<br/>

<p></p>
<p>Why am I recording a CD?</p>
<p>The one consistent activity in my life over the years in all my varied experiences, is creating music.  One of my earliest memories is of writing songs on my swing set with my guardian angels.  On our family dairy farm, I made musical instruments out of anything I could find, and often serenaded our cows and calves.  I think it must have been calming and healing for all concerned, as they would often relax and go to sleep.</p>
<p>When I was 11 years old, my mom asked what I wanted for Christmas, and I still very  clearly remember my response.  I said, “We probably can’t afford it, but more than anything I would love a guitar.”</p>
<p>Lo and behold, that year I received my first guitar!  Woohoo!  My mom said something to the effect of this being a $20 guitar from Walmart and that if I was serious, she would buy a nice guitar later. </p>
<p>I was so thrilled with this little guitar that I could hardly put it down.  Even though I didn’t have song books or know how to read music, I doodled for hours on end.  Then, a couple of my older sister’s friends sketched some chord diagrams and showed me a few things.  That was the launch pad I needed to really get going.</p>
<p>After a year, my mom honored her promise and bought Aria, a full size guitar, for $178.  I was really smitten and continue to play this beautiful guitar today. (Check out the song titled, “Aria” on the <a href=""https://janieworm.bandcamp.com/album/closer-to-home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Closer to Home CD.)</a></p>
<p>Music became part of our gatherings and time with neighbors.  I also began writing original songs and playing them for others.  The first real sharing was an original song I wrote in junior high for the girls basketball team, which I was part of.  </p>
<p>In high school, my twin brother and I sang with a handful of friends.  Soon we were leading a church folk choir for the high school services at the school we attended.  We were also asked to sing at weddings, parties and other events.</p>
<p>I am ever grateful for the amazing communities I have known and shared music with over the years.  Of course, that includes many sweet animals, my very large family, friends, athletic teams, school clubs, and church groups.  In college I continued to sing, performed with a band, and played for Parks &amp; Recreation activities.  I also harmonized with fellow landscapers, and led sing-alongs as a Park Ranger.  </p>
<p>When I moved across the country, I began writing original songs with more focus and learned a lot from fellow musicians, sound engineers, poets and song writers.  In 1995 I recorded my first CD, <i>The Journey</i>, on a shoe string budget with recording engineer, Gary Mula.  It was an amazing experience! </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453675210/ms1oasw7pur4vsjyvmkn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i><b>                                   </b>Janie Worm &amp; Gary Mula, 2015</i><br/><p></p>
<p>Then, I began performing at festivals, coffee houses, spiritual seminars, and other venues on a regular basis.  A few years later, in 2003, I recorded two more CD’s, <i>Closer to Home</i> and <i>Higher Ground</i>.  Common sources of inspiration for my songs are nature, relationships, personal life experiences and spiritual exploration.  </p>
<p>A move to the midwest for a graduate degree in counseling and wilderness work, was also conducive for honing my skills.  While continuing to write and perform, I learned about music therapy and healing.  My internship included music and drumming with seniors, which I thoroughly enjoy.</p>
<p>No matter what I am doing… whether painting, gardening, hiking, or cooking… there is always a song in my heart.  I often whistle or sing through daily activities when alone.  In the morning when I wake up, I usually have a tune on my lips, or a melody lightly coming through.</p>
<p>So, music has been a constant companion throughout my life.  Regardless of what line of work I am in, or however many jobs I am doing, music is present and vital to who I am.  In fact, I like to think that it is the primary gift that I am to share with those around me.  </p>
<p>Now, in 2016, it is time to record another CD called <i>Set Me Free</i>.  Many of you know these tunes, as I have played them over the last few years.  And for those who have gently asked time and again when they will be available, the answer is, “Real soon.”</p>
<p>Thank you so much for supporting my work and who I am.  It  is an ongoing adventure to pursue what I love to do in this world, and an honor to share it.  I appreciate all who have encouraged me, sung with me, and have asked me to write songs for their weddings and worship services.  I am truly blessed and grateful.</p>
<p>In the words of one of my completed songs for this CD, “Shine”, I want to say, “My love is yours, and yours is mine.  Together we shine, shine, shine, shine, shine.”*</p>
<p>May we all support each other in finding a way to do what we love.  Thank you again!  May the blessings be!</p>
<p>Janie</p>

<p>This is the minimum cost estimated for this recording project. There is the possibility for fluctuation in what is needed, but a base goal of $10K will get us in the ballpark of creating a high quality, professional product.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your generous love and support!</p>

My Story

Why am I recording a CD?
The one consistent activity in my life over the years in all my varied experiences, is creating music.  One of my earliest memories is of writing songs on my swing set with my guardian angels.  On our family dairy farm, I made musical instruments out of anything I could find, and often serenaded our cows and calves.  I think it must have been calming and healing for all concerned, as they would often relax and go to sleep.
When I was 11 years old, my mom asked what I wanted for Christmas, and I still very  clearly remember my response.  I said, “We probably can’t afford it, but more than anything I would love a guitar.”
Lo and behold, that year I received my first guitar!  Woohoo!  My mom said something to the effect of this being a $20 guitar from Walmart and that if I was serious, she would buy a nice guitar later. 
I was so thrilled with this little guitar that I could hardly put it down.  Even though I didn’t have song books or know how to read music, I doodled for hours on end.  Then, a couple of my older sister’s friends sketched some chord diagrams and showed me a few things.  That was the launch pad I needed to really get going.
After a year, my mom honored her promise and bought Aria, a full size guitar, for $178.  I was really smitten and continue to play this beautiful guitar today. (Check out the song titled, “Aria” on the Closer to Home CD.)
Music became part of our gatherings and time with neighbors.  I also began writing original songs and playing them for others.  The first real sharing was an original song I wrote in junior high for the girls basketball team, which I was part of.  
In high school, my twin brother and I sang with a handful of friends.  Soon we were leading a church folk choir for the high school services at the school we attended.  We were also asked to sing at weddings, parties and other events.
I am ever grateful for the amazing communities I have known and shared music with over the years.  Of course, that includes many sweet animals, my very large family, friends, athletic teams, school clubs, and church groups.  In college I continued to sing, performed with a band, and played for Parks & Recreation activities.  I also harmonized with fellow landscapers, and led sing-alongs as a Park Ranger.  
When I moved across the country, I began writing original songs with more focus and learned a lot from fellow musicians, sound engineers, poets and song writers.  In 1995 I recorded my first CD, The Journey, on a shoe string budget with recording engineer, Gary Mula.  It was an amazing experience! 


                                   Janie Worm & Gary Mula, 2015
Then, I began performing at festivals, coffee houses, spiritual seminars, and other venues on a regular basis.  A few years later, in 2003, I recorded two more CD’s, Closer to Home and Higher Ground.  Common sources of inspiration for my songs are nature, relationships, personal life experiences and spiritual exploration.  
A move to the midwest for a graduate degree in counseling and wilderness work, was also conducive for honing my skills.  While continuing to write and perform, I learned about music therapy and healing.  My internship included music and drumming with seniors, which I thoroughly enjoy.
No matter what I am doing… whether painting, gardening, hiking, or cooking… there is always a song in my heart.  I often whistle or sing through daily activities when alone.  In the morning when I wake up, I usually have a tune on my lips, or a melody lightly coming through.
So, music has been a constant companion throughout my life.  Regardless of what line of work I am in, or however many jobs I am doing, music is present and vital to who I am.  In fact, I like to think that it is the primary gift that I am to share with those around me.  
Now, in 2016, it is time to record another CD called Set Me Free.  Many of you know these tunes, as I have played them over the last few years.  And for those who have gently asked time and again when they will be available, the answer is, “Real soon.”
Thank you so much for supporting my work and who I am.  It  is an ongoing adventure to pursue what I love to do in this world, and an honor to share it.  I appreciate all who have encouraged me, sung with me, and have asked me to write songs for their weddings and worship services.  I am truly blessed and grateful.
In the words of one of my completed songs for this CD, “Shine”, I want to say, “My love is yours, and yours is mine.  Together we shine, shine, shine, shine, shine.”*
May we all support each other in finding a way to do what we love.  Thank you again!  May the blessings be!
Janie

Cost of the Recording Project
 Below is an image showing the estimated minimum cost of recording this full-length CD.  The nutshell version of the diagrams below:Studio Time ($500 per day X 12 days) = $6,000                                                                                                                                         Mixing $2,500                                                                                                                                      Mastering $500                                                                                           CD Duplication (standard run) $1,000
                                                     Total = $10,000 
   
This is the minimum cost estimated for this recording project. There is the possibility for fluctuation in what is needed, but a base goal of $10K will get us in the ballpark of creating a high quality, professional product.


Thank you so much for your generous love and support!

Chance & Coincidence
 The goal of this IndieGogo campaign is to raise the funds needed to record a full-length CD in a professional recording studio.  It is a possibility that more money is needed than estimated.  In such a case, I have some ideas.  Coming from a ""can do"" farm family, I know that there are many ways to achieve a goal.  So I am prepared to get creative and make this work one way or another.  That may involve some DIY strategies, bartering/ trading, accepting generous offers from professionals in the music field, noticing amazing coincidences and saying ""yes"" to miracles, and other options.  Either way, the show must go on.  I trust that each step of the way will be perfect! As my song says in the video, ""About Janie"", I must ""have a little faith.""

<p>Their recording of Braid's works was completed in November 2015 at the Czech
National TV studio, and mixed and mastered in the United States by multi-grammy award winning

Ever since I was seven, I've always been big into writing novels and short stories and such... but when I finally felt that I was good enough at guitar, I really became serious about the idea of making a full ten track album of my songs. Even though I've written twenty-seven songs, I feel that the ten songs on this debut album fit together perfectly. </p><p> </p><p>Although the album doesn't actually have a song titled, <i>Resilience</i>, the ten songs on this album seem to have a common theme. That, no matter what challenges we may face in our lives, we must power through with resilience. </p><p> </p><p>I won't go too much into my personal life, but I will say that I've already faced some intense challenges and loses. But although this album was made because I wanted to do it, I know that my father would've wanted me to make it as well. So, this album is for him, it's for me, and, of course, it's for you.</p><p> </p><p><i>Resilience</i> is for anyone who loves and appreciates music. I think there's a song for every kind of person on this album, whether it's someone who wants something soft and comforting, maybe something more rock oriented and heavy, or maybe both in the same song! ... No screaming vocals, though... just singing :) But we have one acoustic track (<i>Ups &amp; Downs</i>), a mildly silly song (<i>Mr. Murphy</i>), and the rest are a mixed bag of goodies! Trust me! But, they all fall under the genre of rock... so don't think that this is some reggae-pop album or something.</p><p> </p><p>This album was quite a shot in the dark when I first started pursuing it, but as I said, fans of mine demanded it and I wanted to deliver. So, with the help of Russ, Joshua, Addam, and Ivan, we bring you my very first album, <i>Resilience.</i></p><p> </p><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read all of this. All funds are greatly appreciated and will be used for the production and distribution of my album. </p><p> </p><p>-Henry</p><p> </p><h2><strong>If I meet/exceed my goal...</strong></h2><p> </p><p>As I've looked at other Indiegogo pages and campaigns, I've noticed something... most of them make promises to do other events or awesome things if they meet or exceed their goal!

Ever since I was seven, I've always been big into writing novels and short stories and such... but when I finally felt that I was good enough at guitar, I really became serious about the idea of making a full ten track album of my songs. Even though I've written twenty-seven songs, I feel that the ten songs on this debut album fit together perfectly.  Although the album doesn't actually have a song titled, Resilience, the ten songs on this album seem to have a common theme. That, no matter what challenges we may face in our lives, we must power through with resilience.  I won't go too much into my personal life, but I will say that I've already faced some intense challenges and loses. But although this album was made because I wanted to do it, I know that my father would've wanted me to make it as well. So, this album is for him, it's for me, and, of course, it's for you. Resilience is for anyone who loves and appreciates music. I think there's a song for every kind of person on this album, whether it's someone who wants something soft and comforting, maybe something more rock oriented and heavy, or maybe both in the same song! ... No screaming vocals, though... just singing :) But we have one acoustic track (Ups & Downs), a mildly silly song (Mr. Murphy), and the rest are a mixed bag of goodies! Trust me! But, they all fall under the genre of rock... so don't think that this is some reggae-pop album or something. This album was quite a shot in the dark when I first started pursuing it, but as I said, fans of mine demanded it and I wanted to deliver. So, with the help of Russ, Joshua, Addam, and Ivan, we bring you my very first album, Resilience. Thank you so much for taking the time to read all of this. All funds are greatly appreciated and will be used for the production and distribution of my album.  -Henry If I meet/exceed my goal... As I've looked at other Indiegogo pages and campaigns, I've noticed something... most of them make promises to do other events or awesome things if they meet or exceed their goal! Or even if they just get close to their goal! So, in that case... here we go: $500 raised: I plan on doing this anyway, but I will make sure our promo video (coming soon) is the bees knees. $800 (goal) met: CDs will be put on the fast track to production, and might be available sooner than October 14th (target release date for the album, or maybe the 21st depending on how fast the Indiegogo funds come in. $1,500-$1,600 raised: Not only will we have an awesome promo video, but we will make a music video for one of the other songs on the album! Don't worry, the music video won't be too wacky... unless you'd like that. $2,500 raised: If this happened, I would be pretty blown away! Not that I think it's impossible, however... anyway! If this happens, why not make a second music video, with a professional cast and explosions and such!? (Explosions may be hazardous and not included).

I'll just have to put a band together. Special thanks I meant to put this information the first time around, but I'd like to thank a few people real quick, if I may!

with a symphonic structure. Usually in all my pieces I have been using a string

soundtrack.</p>
<p>All the recording channels are mostly
played by live musicians, and the majority are invited from the Symphonic System

invited the well-known arranger Franco Castellani who currently lives and works

<p>Besides, being the composer of all the music of this CD, I

<p>These projects involve usually many people such as guest
musicians, the recording studio (approximately 120 hours of recording), recording
engineers, the arrangers, the mix engineer, mastering, the designer of the
discs and of course the final print of the CDs. I am setting a goal
to raise $10,000 USD. This money will be used to pay the musicians, the studio time, mixing and mastering the record. Funds will also be

Requesting your valuable

Gustin.
My name is Abraham Gustin

<h3>Keep the Electric (Music) On!</h3>
<p><strong>Electric Berea</strong> exists to promote live local amplified music in the Berea, Kentucky area.  Although our small Appalachian town is best known for its bluegrass, folk, and other acoustic-based musical acts, <i>there's so much more that you can hear here</i>.  In order to bring diverse genres of plugged-in music (country, funk, jazz, reggae, rock, etc.) to our hometown audiences at no cost to the public while still paying fair compensation to local performers, <i>we need your financial help</i>. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Thus far, anonymous donors and private sponsors have enabled us to meet 60% of our fundraising goal for our next event on May 16, 2020.  But <i><strong>we still need $500</strong></i> to be able to pay all of the performers that we hope to bring to you!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><i>All funds raised go directly to the performers</i></strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Donors at the $100 level and above will be recognized publicly</i></strong> through all advertising for the event as well as during onstage announcements at the event!</li>
<li>If we are unable to meet our target amount, whatever amount is raised will be used to fund a reduced version of the event.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why You Should Donate</h3>

</div></div>","Keep the Electric (Music) On!
Electric Berea exists to promote live local amplified music in the Berea, Kentucky area.  Although our small Appalachian town is best known for its bluegrass, folk, and other acoustic-based musical acts, there's so much more that you can hear here.  In order to bring diverse genres of plugged-in music (country, funk, jazz, reggae, rock, etc.) to our hometown audiences at no cost to the public while still paying fair compensation to local performers, we need your financial help. 

What We Need & What You Get
Thus far, anonymous donors and private sponsors have enabled us to meet 60% of our fundraising goal for our next event on May 16, 2020.  But we still need $500 to be able to pay all of the performers that we hope to bring to you!


All funds raised go directly to the performers.

Donors at the $100 level and above will be recognized publicly through all advertising for the event as well as during onstage announcements at the event!
If we are unable to meet our target amount, whatever amount is raised will be used to fund a reduced version of the event.  


 
Why You Should Donate
Back in the 1960s and '70s, many Americans grew up with live music all around them -- and not just celebrity performers, but their next-door neighbors.  It has been estimated that, at one point in the late 1960s, 1 out of 4 young Americans were playing in a garage band.  When kids went to their middle and high school dances, they often were entertained by local musicians. 
These days, most kids grow up seeing live music only on YouTube or some other screen.  Their school dances feature music provided by DJs.   Much of this music is produced electronically using computers, drum machines, and audio samples rather than directly performed on actual musical instruments held in the hands.  All of this music is made by people whom they've never met and who may seem impossibly talented and remote from their own experience and potential.  Many kids today simply don't know how powerful, inspirational, and above all, fun it can be to see folks who are not too much older than they are making live music in a variety of genres on real musical instruments, singing without AutoTune.  If we want there to be next-generation-equivalents of Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Prince, or Kurt Cobain, then we need to show youth in our community that it's possible (and, again, FUN!) to pick up a guitar, a keyboard, or a drum kit and make music in public.
Donating to support Electric Berea performer fees not only helps to bring live, local amplified music to the community free of charge.  Your donation also contributes to fair wages for gigging musicians in our community, many of whom are frequently asked to play ""for exposure"" (i.e., no financial compensation).  In our community, where almost 1 out of 4 residents live below the poverty line (a rate which is more than twice the national average of 13%), arts events must offer free admission in order to attract an audience.

<h3>I need a bit of help to get to the finishing line</h3>
<p>In October 2019 I recorded a few demos in my friends' house while they were on holidays. I then sent these recordings to Stefan Breuer in Bilthoven, the Netherlands. He saw their potential, and I wish I could say the rest is history, but we're quite there yet. So much work has gone into adding instruments, re-recording guitar here and there, and then there was the minor barrier of the global pandemic.</p>
<p>If my music is new to you, allow me to introduce myself -</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm Geri van Essen, living in the east end of London, a folk singer with some soul and blues influences. I do also have a day job but despite this there are not quite enough funds for the last lap of the process to bring my new album into the world.</li>
<li>The working title of the album is Cleaned the Windows</li>
<li>These songs are all new, and written by myself. Main themes: connection, loneliness, distance, home life. The sound is a mix of melancholy and groovy soul.</li>
<li>The first single came out in June 2020: 23/32 (see the video)</li>
<li>My debut album was well received and resulted in a Radio 6 live performance and interview in March 2018</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>I only need £490 </h3>
<p>The break-down is simple -</p>
<ul>
<li>270 euro for the mastering</li>
<li>270 euro for the printing of 200 cds</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The impact</h3>
<p>The direct result of your support for my project will be that I can set the mastering and printing process in motion. Please back my project because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whilst it is a personal document of the last few years, I hope it will speak to others and enable reflection on the themes of the album. Since March 2020 my songs about loneliness, distance and connection have received a new layer of meaning. We've all had to adapt to new ways of connecting to others since March 2020.</li>
<li>Mastering is an important part of the process to release an album and I'm pleased to have selected one of the best for a very reasonable price.</li>
<li>If you back this project, not only will you receive a copy of the album (either digital or physical), you will also enable others to discover, stream and buy my new music.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>There are little to no risks involved in this project because the recording and mixing have been finalised. The person who will carry out the final mastering, is ready to go once I have the funds. Following that there are no obstacles to getting 200 cds printed.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Hi there, my name is Chris Rattie. I’m a songwriter living, working, and creating in Central Pennsylvania. I’ve been a touring musician since my early 20’s; music is my life and I am fortunate to get to do what I love. In 2013 I independently released my debut album <i>All These Things.</i> I put together a band and off we went. We hit the road and met so many great people- curious about a band they’d never heard of and willing to check us out. It’s one of the best parts about playing music.</p>
<p>Around this time I moved into an old farmhouse with my lady and began writing some new songs. For the first time in years I felt at home; I had found my place. The essence of our country home was the front porch. We drank our morning coffee there. It was where friends met on summer nights, music from the record player drifting through our screen door. We talked about our future and argued about politics. We smoked too many cigarettes on that porch. One time, a traveling folk-punk string band used it to put on a show for our neighbors.</p>
<p>I wrote most of these new songs sitting there, eyeballing the occasional car that drove by a little too fast and waving at those that kept it in the friendly speed range. The songs on <i>Porch</i> are direct reflections of what was happening that first summer and winter in our new home. They <strong>are about finding our place, about our joys and worries, and our dubiety at the world we watched changing so quickly from that well worn porch. </strong>The songs are about facets of life that ring true for everyone, no matter where your porch is.</p>
<p>In 2015 the band and I began recording these songs. Some like-minded folks we knew started a label and we decided to make a record with them. It was all quite exciting; unfortunately the record label folded- It happens- Often times our dreams are much bigger than our billfold and we slam hard into brick walls of reality. My band and I are now left with a complete album, but lack the funds to release it. We are so proud of this new music and are excited and eager to share it.</p>
<p><strong>We need you, </strong>the good people we’ve met along the way, and maybe some who we’ve yet to meet, to help us get this record out. It would mean so much to us. We’ve worked so hard and can’t stop now.</p>
<p><u><strong>How It All Breaks Down</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Mastering: $1,000</strong>:</p>
<p>This is the final step in the process. Mastering is often referred to as a “Dark Art”, as it is so difficult to describe what a mastering engineer actually does. Simply put, it’s the final layer of polish. It’s what makes a song jump out of your speakers and rumble your floor.</p>
<p><strong>Printing Vinyl: $2,000</strong></p>
<p>Is there anything better than dropping the needle on a great record? We are really excited about ours and feel that everyone needs to hear it in the best possible way.</p>
<p><strong>CDs and Digital Downloads: $600</strong></p>
<p>Hey, you can’t listen to vinyl in your car…. And we hope you’ll take this record with you everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Design:</strong>  </p>
<p>We are working with H6 Design on our new website as well as artwork for the album and will be setting aside a portion of the funds raised to help pay for this.</p>
<p><strong>Campaign Expense:</strong></p>
<p>We will be setting aside a percentage of the funds raised to pay our good friends Dave Metty and Denis Alan for making an excellent campaign video, and to cover the cost of shipping our pledge packages to you!</p>
<p><strong>Van &amp; Touring Expense:</strong></p>
<p>Touring is our business and livelihood. We are excited to be working with our new booking partner at Blue Moon Management and we have some big release shows planned this fall. We just need a way to get there! Any remaining funds we raise will go towards buying a van and the expenses of hitting the road. We want to come to your town and play for you. Nothing would make us happier!</p>

<p><strong>My name is Auresia and it is my dream to record a Ukrainian Reggae Album in Ukraine!</strong> The album will be called <i><strong>Korinnya</strong></i> (meaning roots in Ukrainian) and I will be mixing traditional Ukrainian instrumentation with roots reggae rhythms. I have already been in contact with some of  the top  World, Jazz and Reggae musicians and studios that Ukraine has to offer and am very excited as they have expressed a lot of interest in working together on this album. I cannot wait to share  the positive vibes of reggae with the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>I plan to record at one of Ukraine's most prestigious recording studios in Kiev- <i><strong>ISTOK </strong></i> under the reknown producer/engineer, <i><strong>Aleksy Krivosheyev</strong></i> (Skay, Jamala, Ivan Dorn, Oleg Skrypka, Bahroma Band, Poshlaya Molly, Dilara &amp; Samra(<strong><i>Eurovision</i></strong>)).</p>
<p><strong><i>Marina Krut</i> </strong>(from my latest music video-Raíces) who was recently a semi- finalist on <i><strong>XFactor </strong></i>is one of the top Ukrainian Bandura  players and will be performing on the album. I have been in touch with <i><strong>Denis Shvets</strong></i> on drums (<i><strong>SunSay</strong></i>), guitarist <i><strong>Roman Kucherenko</strong></i> (<i><strong>SunSay/ 5Nizza</strong></i>), bassist <i><strong>Nikita Astrakhantsev</strong></i> (Antytila, MamaRika), amoungst others who are very interested as well. The goal of the album will be 10 songs with 4 of them to be recorded with these top musicians. The other 6 songs  I will be re-releasing Ukrainian versions translated from some of my favorite songs from my previous albums adding Ukrainian ehancements. Other than the <i><strong>Bandura</strong></i> , I would love to incorporate other Ukrainian traditional instruments such as <i><strong>Sopilka</strong></i> (wooden flute) and <i><strong>Cimbalom</strong></i> (dulcimer). As well I will make space on the album for a couple song tributes to the Ukrainian tradition , including my dad and his wonderful accordion:-)</p> <h3>So...this is where you come in.

<p>Hello there metalheads and headbangers of the world! We are The Silent Wedding from Athens, Greece and we are pleased to meet you. So far we have released an EP and two full length albums ""Livin' Experiments"" and ""Enigma Eternal”. Moreover,  we have, five official video releases: To Them, The Return, A Dream of Choices, Silence, Loneliness. Since 2012 we have participated in four European tours and mini tours with bands such as Threshold, Maiden United and Voodoo Six. We have also shared the stage with Iced Earth, Saxon, Epica, Firewind, Fates Warning, Warrel Dane, Timo Tolkki (ex. Stratovarious), Tygers Of Pan Tang, Caravan, Lizzy Borden.</p>
<p>Touring is obviously our favorite part of playing in this band. Every single show is important to us because there’s no better way to share our music with the world. In 2014 we toured with Threshold across Europe in over 10 countries and 19 shows in total. Now we are getting ready to rock Europe again on our next tour with this amazing band from Oct. 10th till Oct. 21<span style=""font-size: 12px;"">st</span> (tour dates bellow). So far we have made all of this possible with our own efforts, the incomes of our live shows, albums, T-shirts and variable merchandise. As you probably know, things have been difficult in Greece for pretty much everyone and it hasn't been any different for us. For those of you who know us or have seen us perform live, you know we always give 100% of our energy in every show, no matter the difficulties we face. In the case of this tour, we are thrilled to share the stage with Threshold once again but in all honesty, we were also concerned what that means for our budget.</p>
<p>This is why we turn to you, our friends and fans. We've created this page offering a series of perks and some indiegogo exclusives which you can purchase. This will not only help us with our tour alongside Threshold but also with the release of our third album which is already in the process of pre-production. The smallest contribution will be invaluable to us. We hope to see you soon on the nearest gig. Until then, rock on and stay heavy!</p>

<h3>What This Is About</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm Cody!</p>
<p> To put it simply, I make music inspired by my experiences digging in the trenches of the heart and soul with the Father, Son and Spirit. I've been singing all my life, and started writing songs at a young age.  I fell head-over-heels in love with a musician about six years ago, we had two beautiful kids (with one on the way), and now we feel is the time to dive into the process of recording my songs - because we're insane!</p>
<p>This campaign will allow us to record and publish songs that I've been writing and cultivating for years. This music has lifted me out of my darkest times, and I believe it can do the same for anyone who hears it. Partnering with us means you are helping create an album that is meaningful, powerful, and crafted with excellence.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising $12,000 to cover the cost of hiring musicians, studio time, producing, mixing, and publishing the album. We realize this seems lofty, but if we're doing this, we're doing it right!</p>
<p>Each contribution will receive perks such as an EARLY DIGITAL DOWNLOAD of the album, HANDWRITTEN LYRICS of one of the songs, a PERSONALIZED SONG ABOUT YOU, and more awesome stuff!</p>
<p>If the full amount doesn't come in (but it will, because it has to), all funds will still be used for creating the album or an EP of selected songs and fulfilling perks.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When you give toward this project, you are investing in a dream to bring hope, freedom, and truth through every lyric and melody coming out of this record. What amazes me about these songs is that I hadn't the slightest idea what they would mean to me at the time they were written. Some of them are declarative, vertical praise overflowing from heart of gratitude, others are straight from the dialogue that takes place when you start to question why you believe in a God who seems like He couldn't care less. They are real, raw, and honest. I can look back and see how I was interceding for my own heart, as well as the hearts of others, while feeling completely numb to the love that continued to carry me. I have tried to keep these songs to myself and I can't any more. They are begging to be released on the world, and YOU can help them make the greatest impact possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Here's where it gets real:</p>
<p>I am a stay-at-home mom, and my husband runs his own business. This project will not get all our attention every day. HOWEVER, we are committed to making this happen, and our spare time will be focused on arranging songs, consulting with a  producer, and practicing, practicing, practicing! Once the funding goal is reached we will be able to work with musicians and smooth out every detail before recording. We want this music in your ears as soon as possible!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While we definitely need money (duh) we also need to get the word out! Share, share, share this project on social media and utilize the Indiegogo share tools! </p>

<p>It's not a secret that my vocal range changed after an operation in 2014. I never enjoyed my singing voice before then, but now I can sing a few steps deeper and it's got power to it. I want to put a lot of time into the vocals for this album, made possible with more studio hours.</p>

<h3>Join the Christmas Party!</h3>
<p>Hello, I’m Rocky Paterra. I’m a NYC-based songwriter recording an album of original holiday music featuring a different artist singing every track that I’ve written.</p>
<p>We’ve been recording and making this thing since January. I’m working with some amazing producers, musicians, and vocalists to bring my festive musical visions to life!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need In My Stocking</h3>
<p>I’d love your help to make this happen. Here’s a list (check it twice!) of what I’m hoping for:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m trying to crowdfund $2,500 to help support my time in the recording studio, compensate my collaborators, and get my album the marketing and promotion that it deserves.</li>
<li>In addition to festive ‘thank you’ messages and holiday cards and song covers, my perks include merch such as pins and polaroids, exclusive demo files of my songs pre-production, an opportunity to hear yourself on the album, and the opportunity for a songwriting session with me!</li>
<li>This campaign is flex funding, so even if I don’t make my goal, I can keep what we raise. And it will indeed be put to use!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Jingling All The Way</h3>
<p>This album is going to happen no matter what! And your contributions will help it so much towards becoming the fully realized version of what’s been in my head for many months:</p>
<ul>
<li>The holiday season keeps on giving. This project can be something that more and more people can enjoy every year!</li>
<li>Making my last album was an incredible journey, and I’m coming into this project even more focused and prepared.</li>
<li>I have made a commitment to myself that this album is top priority, and I have been recording regularly since the very beginning of the year. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Naughty And The Nice</h3>
<p>Coordinating schedules and availability on such a collaborative project can be difficult. I’m working tirelessly to stay one step ahead. </p>
<ul>
<li>Booking studio time and paying for promotion/distribution is expensive. Hype can be a hefty sum in marketing world. </li>
<li>I plan on making a few music videos for the album and planning for special aspects like some vinyls and various merch items, but the main priority from a financial standpoint is getting the album recorded and promoted.</li>
<li>I have been working steadily throughout the year to plan ahead for the expenses that accompany an album release.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Please Do Put A Penny In The Old Man’s Hat</h3>
<p>Times are hard. Money is tight. I get it! If you can’t donate, here’s what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign on your social medias. Share the link on Facebook. Email some people you know that love the holidays!</li>
<li>Get the word out to those who might be able to donate to independent artists/musicians!</li>
<li>Hook me up with some connections that might be able to help in any way towards making this album experience all that it can be!</li>

<h3>Bakgrund samt vinyl-, cd- och dikttryck</h3>
<p>Jag heter Rickard Eklund. Frontman och låtskrivare i dialektrockbandet Schlagwerk och nu även soloartist. Detta år släpps det efterlängtade studioalbumet ""1. (ätt)"".</p>
<p>Hösten 2016 släpptes låten Finland, en låt om utanförskap och fördomar, som blev röstad till årets finlandssvenska låt. Samma år belönades jag även med första plats i Solveig von Schoultz dikttävling. 2017 fortsatte framgångarna med låtarna Tuva, Adrian och Sömntåg, vilka alla har mottagits positivt. Arbetet med detta album har varit långt och rigoröst. Låtarna på det kommande albumet, som bla. har jämförts med musik av storheter som The Band, Tom Waits och Billy Joel, kommer att innehålla trumpeter, tuba, cello, eufonium, trombon, trummor, piano, flöjt och sång på Närpesdialekt. Min förhoppning, och målet med projektet, är att tillsammans lyckas finansiera ett tryck på 250 vinylskivor och 500 cd-skivor.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Ok! Låter bra, men vad får <u>vi</u> ut av det här?</h3>
<p>Detta kan knappast förklaras enklare än så här:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ni har den unika möjligheten att reservera era egna exemplar av albumet i antingen digitalt, LP och/eller cd-format.</li>
<li>Det finns även specialförmåner med att beställa från denna sida<ul>
<li>Billigare</li>
<li>Unika erbjudanden såsom dikttryck och personliga tack tryckta i LP-fodralet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ni får fungera som en aktiv och viktig del i processen. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kom ihåg</strong> att inga vinylskivor trycks, om inte målet på 3100 € uppfylls.</p>

</div></div>","Bakgrund samt vinyl-, cd- och dikttryck
Jag heter Rickard Eklund. Frontman och låtskrivare i dialektrockbandet Schlagwerk och nu även soloartist. Detta år släpps det efterlängtade studioalbumet ""1. (ätt)"".
Hösten 2016 släpptes låten Finland, en låt om utanförskap och fördomar, som blev röstad till årets finlandssvenska låt. Samma år belönades jag även med första plats i Solveig von Schoultz dikttävling. 2017 fortsatte framgångarna med låtarna Tuva, Adrian och Sömntåg, vilka alla har mottagits positivt. Arbetet med detta album har varit långt och rigoröst. Låtarna på det kommande albumet, som bla. har jämförts med musik av storheter som The Band, Tom Waits och Billy Joel, kommer att innehålla trumpeter, tuba, cello, eufonium, trombon, trummor, piano, flöjt och sång på Närpesdialekt. Min förhoppning, och målet med projektet, är att tillsammans lyckas finansiera ett tryck på 250 vinylskivor och 500 cd-skivor.  
 

Ok! Låter bra, men vad får vi ut av det här?
Detta kan knappast förklaras enklare än så här:

Ni har den unika möjligheten att reservera era egna exemplar av albumet i antingen digitalt, LP och/eller cd-format.
Det finns även specialförmåner med att beställa från denna sida
Billigare
Unika erbjudanden såsom dikttryck och personliga tack tryckta i LP-fodralet


Ni får fungera som en aktiv och viktig del i processen. 

Kom ihåg att inga vinylskivor trycks, om inte målet på 3100 € uppfylls.
 
Men hur?
På denna sida hittar ni bilder på omslaget, där det t.ex. står ""Dubbel-LP + nerladdning 25 €"" eller ""CD-album 20 €"". Om ni trycker på dessa bilder, öppnar det en ny sida där man kan skriva in kontokortsuppgifter. 
Ni kan även trycka på ""Back it"", om ni vill donera en valfri summa.

<p>The long awaited follow up album to Sin Shake Sin's 2014 album ""<i>Lunatics and Slaves</i>"" will be released on March 6th 2020.   What started as a personal project of producer/songwriter Stacy Hogan, has now surpassed 30 Million streams, been featured in multiple movies + TV Shows including ""<i>Vampire Diaries</i>"" and Netflix's ""<i>Little Evil</i>"" , reached #5 on Billboard's Most Added Rock Radio Charts,  featured in rotation on Sirius/XM Octane, chosen as the pick of the week on multiple nationally syndicated FM programs including Lou Brutus's <i>Hard Drive</i> and L.A Lloyd's <i>Top 30 Countdown</i>... all of this while being unsigned.   </p>
<ul>
<li>Now, it is time for chapter 2. <br/>So many ask.. ""What took so long?""  Just after the 1st album came out, I became a father.  My daughter was born extremely premature (weighing 1 pound 15 ounces)..and the next year was full of hell for her including eye surgeries, a hole in her heart, multiple blood transfusions, and more..  Fast forward to 2020, and I have a perfectly healthy amazingly intelligent 4 year old daughter who already knows the words to many of these songs which I can't wait to share with you!<br/> </li>
<li>This campaign is important because this is how it all started.   The 1st album was funded this way.   Now, with your early contributions, I can not only bring you consistent official music videos for the project, but offer new merch never before available - (The new record on  180 GRAM colored VINYL, etc..!)   The new album is already recorded.  Now, it's time to package, print, and deliver.. then, promote, tour, and spread this music as far as I can.  That's where your contributions help the most!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The message is loud and clear.   This is another concept album from start to finish.   Regardless where you side politically, you must know there are systematic powers in place whose sole job is to create division.   This is nothing new.   This corruption effects our daily lives more than you know.    A huge percentage of local news outlets are now owned by one corporation who feed slanted scripts to affect your opinion while you are waiting on tonight's lottery numbers.   The memes shared millions of times...  all created by a company as propaganda so that you feel love towards one side and hate towards another.   This division is highly profitable for a select few.   They use your fear.  They use your religion.  They use pure falsehoods.... all to make us label and hate our fellow countrymen.   Those who profit from this just happen to be the ones who skillfully lobby and pay our politicians to bend things in their favor, not ours... not the citizens.  We must stop taking the low hanging fruit.  We are smarter than that.   Let's work together so that these songs are no longer relevant in any administration. </p>

<p>    Years ago, a friend told me a metaphor that has stuck with me ever since.  It goes like this: <u><i>everything in life is either an anchor or a balloon</i></u>.  Anchors can keep you grounded, humble, calm, and safe; but when they become too heavy, they can be burdensome, weigh you down, and make you feel stuck and unable to continue your journey.  On the other hand, balloons lift your spirits, bring you self-worth, and make you feel joy and even ecstasy; but when they get too full of air, they can give you hubris and bloat your ego until the point that you soar into the sun and get burned up like Icarus.  This is the inspiration for my third studio album, <strong>ANCHORS AND BALLOONS</strong>. </p>
<p>       This album is all about dichotomies: the juxtaposition between light and darkness, hope and despair, love and loss, the cerebral and the emotional, gratitude and yearning, holy and profane, tradition and innovation, memory and dreaming for the future, longing to be heard and remembering to listen.  ANCHORS AND BALLOONS will contain 13 songs, some of them re-imaginations of liturgical gems that have been inspired by my studies in Cantorial school, as well songs that come straight from my imagination and my heart.</p>
<p>    My last album, ONE, was released almost three years ago.  Since then, I have worked on producing records for over a dozen Jewish artists from around the country, helping them to realize their creative visions.  Now, I humbly ask for your help to allow me to achieve my creative vision with this project.  For those of you who supported the creation of my last album, ONE, several years ago, I hope you will continue to join me on my artistic journey.  And for those of you who have come into my life more recently, I would be eternally grateful for your support as well.</p>
<p>    Reading the news lately breaks my heart.  Every week seems to bring more bloodshed and injustice.  But as maestro Leonard Bernstein once said, “This will be our reply to violence: to make music, more intensely, more beautifully, more devotedly than ever before.”  This music is the best way I know how to respond to this broken world.</p>

<h3>I’m Maya Law, a songwriter and solo artist based in Norwich. For the past four years, I’ve been working on and refining the sound that this forthcoming concept EP will convey; ‘Hitchhiking’ will begin acoustic, an homage to where I began, and throughout the five tracks will progressively become full band tunes. The idea - to show where I’ve come from and where I’m heading; but I need your help on my way!</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>In 2016, I released my debut album ‘Her or Him’ and went on to tour around the UK, playing to crowds at the Roundhouse and supporting the likes of Loyle Carner and Connie Constance. This campaign will be the pivotal moment for me as an artist that I’ve been waiting for. With your help, I’ll be able to follow on from these achievements and take more steps forward than ever before. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal is to raise £1500. This money will be going towards the budget of vinyl pressing, merchandise, and pushing this EP to a wider audience by transforming my solo performance into a band set up. Your backing will allow me to work with GearBox Records to press vinyls and work closely with jazz artist and vinyl cutting expert Caspar Sutton-Jones to create the experience I intended the audience to have when listening on a hard copy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>In return for your kind donations, you’ll get an exclusive invitation to a private party in Norwich where you’ll be able to hear the EP on vinyl before anyone else gets to and enjoy a line up of Norwich DJs! Exciting stuff!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>With your help, I’ll be able to give justice to the music and all the wonderful people who have been supporting me and working so hard around me thus far. I’ve been pretty quiet since the release of my debut album back in 2016 and now it’s time for more content, more music, and more steps forward. This can only happen with your help! Any size donations that you guys feel comfortable with will push me towards my goal!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please donate what you can and share this all over!</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hi, I'm Rosco Levee and have been a musician all my life since starting playing guitar at 5 years old. I've been the lead singer, guitarist and song-writer in my own band, Rosco Levee &amp; The Southern Slide for the last 5 years and it's been one hell of a ride, with 2 critically acclaimed albums under our belt plus a live album, headlining festivals and with worldwide radio play and a great fan base and following. Anyway, for one reason and another, we've put the Southern Slide on the shelf for a year and I'm  gonna be concentrating on my own album which takes my own blend of psychedelic blues infused rock n roll and push it further and explore some great new ideas and sounds.... <br/><br/>This campaign is massively important to me because without it, I would be unable to fund the 'SOUL-ROLLER' album. I have poured every single penny I possess into being the player and song-writer I am today and yet... it still ain't quite enough y'know? Everything I have gets re-invested into the music and although it pains me to say it, I kinda need a helping hand to get this album (which I think is some of my best work yet!) out to you. I'm pretty fired up and excited about this Album and once you hear the sounds, I'm certain you will be too.... Pre-production is well underway, the band are rehearsing and the songs are sounding fresh and taking on a life of their own! <br/>Those of you that have heard or watched the Southern Slide will know I like a big fat, round, vibey, vintage kinda sound and this new record will be no different in that, so don’t be scared because I’m not gonna change too much from that!  I intend to use a different group of musicians, some you will have heard before on previous RLSS albums and some guys completely new to you. I’ve got a full horn section coming down to help capture some of the brass sounds in my head, these will be the same guys from the last RLSS album so we know they are world class! Add to that a few choice girl backing singers willing to lend their harmonies and energy...  we really are gonna be creating that big band sound on some of these tracks. I’m inviting a few more guest players down and I fully intend to replicate that Phil Spector 'wall of sound' production kinda vibe, so multiple instruments all playing at the same time on one track! <br/><br/>At heart, I’m a live playing musician, so this album will be recorded 'live' in the studio, by the core musicians and the only overdubs will be added for solos where needed, but I really like to get the raw grooves down as best as possible first without a load of computer trickery, so the studio I propose to use is a fantastic, bespoke vintage kind of place way out in the country so we can really focus. <br/><br/>There will be a video diary most days of recording which we’ll put up here so you can see and hear what goes on and find out how we’re coming along and what goes into making a record! <br/><br/>As much as I believe this is gonna be a proper modern day rock n roll record, I haven’t forgotten my roots in the Blues music I so dearly love so I’m planning on recording one of the more 'traditional' blues songs I've written. I’ve been re-visiting some of my early demos in the run up to this album, and I’m really pleased I did. Again like my previous work, this album will be a fairly eclectic mix of songs and sounds, something for everyone. This is from my soul to yours and I’m so excited to have you guys along with me and being part of it all together. I gotta get these songs out there, you people have gotta hear them....and if you dont like it, (sorry no refunds) well I’m sorry.....but we all know you're gonna fucking love it and just wait until we play it live!! <br/><br/>I’m looking to raise £4000 and this will be split between studio and  production costs, paying the professional musicians and the actual manufacture of the record. I want you to know that EVERY penny raised by this campaign will go into getting 'Soul-Roller' out to you good, good people, that really is my focus and so as well as the usual perks like the album, T-shirts, and signed posters, lyric sheets etc. I’m gonna be offering some very special and exclusive items when we launch the campaign AND adding others during the 40 days we’ve given ourselves! These include a Fender Telecaster body from a guitar I loved, now long retired. I have photos of myself playing her before I stripped her for different parts. She’s white, beaten up, but she would look great on someone’s music room wall and is a piece of my history! I’m also offering a day in the studio with myself and the band, this is one of my favourite perks as the lucky person that grabs it, will get a unique look into the work and effort that go into making a record these days, we'll have a lot of fun, and who knows, you may even get to lay down a part if you can play, or if you add some kind of idea, you could end up with a producer credit!! Either way it’ll be a lot of fun. There are exclusive house concerts on offer and if you club together with some friends, I’ll even come and perform in your garden or your local pub! There’s access all areas passes for our shows, hand written lyric sheets, producer credits and all sorts up for grabs so take a look and see if there's something you'd like!<br/>SOUL-ROLLER is is NOT a generic, run of the mill, safe or polite album; it’s a rock n roll shin-dig captured in time, souped up with a super-charger of cosmic, swirling gusto, top musicianship and limitless imagination. It’s gonna make you wanna dance and move your hips like a crazy loon on a hill – there’ll be no rhythmic foot tapping here, you’re gonna stomp a hole through the bloody wooden floorboards! Whatever happens, however much money we raise.... SOUL-ROLLER is coming so get on-board, spread the word, share like crazy and let’s make it happen! <br/><br/>Stay frosty – Rosco. <br/></p></div>","Hi, I'm Rosco Levee and have been a musician all my life since starting playing guitar at 5 years old. I've been the lead singer, guitarist and song-writer in my own band, Rosco Levee & The Southern Slide for the last 5 years and it's been one hell of a ride, with 2 critically acclaimed albums under our belt plus a live album, headlining festivals and with worldwide radio play and a great fan base and following. Anyway, for one reason and another, we've put the Southern Slide on the shelf for a year and I'm  gonna be concentrating on my own album which takes my own blend of psychedelic blues infused rock n roll and push it further and explore some great new ideas and sounds.... This campaign is massively important to me because without it, I would be unable to fund the 'SOUL-ROLLER' album. I have poured every single penny I possess into being the player and song-writer I am today and yet... it still ain't quite enough y'know? Everything I have gets re-invested into the music and although it pains me to say it, I kinda need a helping hand to get this album (which I think is some of my best work yet!) out to you. I'm pretty fired up and excited about this Album and once you hear the sounds, I'm certain you will be too.... Pre-production is well underway, the band are rehearsing and the songs are sounding fresh and taking on a life of their own! Those of you that have heard or watched the Southern Slide will know I like a big fat, round, vibey, vintage kinda sound and this new record will be no different in that, so don’t be scared because I’m not gonna change too much from that!  I intend to use a different group of musicians, some you will have heard before on previous RLSS albums and some guys completely new to you. I’ve got a full horn section coming down to help capture some of the brass sounds in my head, these will be the same guys from the last RLSS album so we know they are world class! Add to that a few choice girl backing singers willing to lend their harmonies and energy...  we really are gonna be creating that big band sound on some of these tracks.

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>We are Cosmogram, a five member post-hardcore funk band hailing from Riverside, California. We started back in late 2014 as a few friends who got together just to jam and play some good music. Soon after our formation however, we realized that music was our collective passion and that this was something we would all love to do for a living.</li>
<li>We started playing shows in the winter of 2015 and have continuously brought in larger and larger crowds who enjoy and generally relate to our music. It is our hope that we can continue to do that for a very, very long time.</li>
<li>We self-produced and released a 5 track EP back in 2015 and have since gone on to write several more songs. It is our hope that this fundraiser will help raise enough money for us to see those songs professionally produced and released.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3> <p>What we need:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>While the band members are all working tirelessly to raise funds for studio time and post processing, we can only do so much in such a short matter of time. So that's where you guys come in. We're asking for any bit of money you can donate in order to help us accomplish what we've dreamed of our entire lives.</li>
<li>All funds raised with this campaign go directly towards studio time, recording, producing, mixing, and mastering. Funds raised will also go towards printing hard copies of the EP, as well as merchandising and promotion.</li>
</ul>
<div>What you get:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>Sometimes it's difficult to really express how amazing our fans make us feel, and how much you all mean to us. We'd like to take a moment and thank every single one of you who has supported us in this journey so far. Whether it was a simple ""good luck"" to us the day before a show, buying or downloading our first EP, coming to support us during one of our live shows, or even following us on social media, your support means everything to us and we wouldn't have come this far without you all. Now, onto the perks!! </li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Anyone who donates $5 or more will receive a digital download of the EP FOR FREE!</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Anyone who donates $10 or more will receive a hard copy of the EP signed by all of us. Maybe we'll even write a cool story for you on the inside of the cover!</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">And finally, anyone who donates at all will have their name put on the EP's Bandcamp, as well as having it printed on the inside of the hard copies. </span></li>
</ul></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>So why should you contribute?</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>For one, you'd be helping a few up and coming musicians continue doing what they love. We aren't in this for the money, nor are we in it for the fame. We genuinely just love playing music for people and putting on a great show. </li>
<li>This EP will mark a new chapter in our lives as a band. With the release of this EP, we hope to gain even more momentum and maybe even grab the attention of local labels and venues.</li>
<li>Once again we'd like to thank every one of you. We wouldn't even be making this campaign if it wasn't for your continued support and encouragement. Even if this is something that never really takes off or gets us to the big time, we certainly won't forget what a wild ride it's been up to this point. In just a year, something we had all once only dreamed about has become a reality, and we couldn't be more grateful for such an amazing time in our lives.</li>
</ul>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> So what are the challenges?</p> <ul> <li>Well, first and foremost is raising enough funds in order to do this in a timely manner. Right now, we sit at a pivotal point for the band. This is our make it our break it moment. It's our now or never. We're more popular than we've ever been, and we want to do something with that momentum while we still have it.</li>
<li>We understand that funding a band that says ""they're going to make it big one day"" is a huge risk on your part. It's possible that we won't be able to raise the funds in time to record and release this EP. But hopefully, we can show people how dedicated and motivated we are to make this a reality. We hope you can see that and will help us make it to where we want to one day be.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>What if I want to support you guys, but just don't have the funds to do it?</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>We understand not everyone has the funds to hand out money, and that's okay, we get it! But we aren't asking for much. Even a $1 donation means a lot to us. It doesn't have to be a lot. We just ask that you give whatever you can.</li>
<li>If you choose not to donate, however, we ask that you at least give us a chance and check us out on social media. You can find us on the following sites:</li>

<div>Thank you all again for checking out this fundraiser, and for your continued support. Our fans, friends and family are the best and none of this would even be remotely possible if it weren't for all of you. Our Cosmofam is amazing and we wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.</div>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p align=""left"">My name is William Peacock (a.k.a. Tony), a Mississippi-born composer who finished his ungraduated degree at Belhaven University under Dr. Andrew Mark Sauerwein and currently resides in Indiana, finishing his Master’s degree in Music Composition at Butler University under Dr. Frank Felice and Dr. Michael Schelle.</p>
<p align=""left"">I recently applied for and was accepted to take part in the Composition Workshop of the <a href=""http://charlottenewmusic.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Charlotte New Music Festival</a>. The CNMF is a two-week celebration of new music held at various locations across Charlotte, North Carolina, partnering with many fine ensembles and living composers to make new music across the city. The Composition Workshop is held during the festival and includes:</p>
<p align=""left"">- Two professional performances of your music:</p>
<p align=""left"" style=""margin-left:21.0pt;"">1) A commissioned work written for the festival.</p>
<p align=""left"" style=""margin-left:21.0pt;"">2) A speedwriting assignment, written and performed during the festival.</p>
<p align=""left"">- Opportunity to work with guest musicians in rehearsing your music.</p>
<p align=""left"">- High-quality audio and video recording of the performances.</p>
<p align=""left"">- Option to perform an additional piece on our “New Music Open Mic Night.”</p>
<p align=""left"">- Lectures by eminent guest composers and musicians.</p>
<p align=""left"">- Two private lessons with guest composers.</p>
<p align=""left"">- Admission to all festival concerts.</p>
<p align=""left"">- Making new friends and being part of a supportive artistic community.</p>
<p align=""left"">- New professional headshot photos for portfolio/website use.</p>
<p align=""left"">While everything above is wonderful, especially the lessons with the composers and rubbing shoulders with fellow artists, I’m most excited about working with the professional musicians. I have been asked to write for Erin Rodgers (saxophone) and Jay Sorce (classical and electric guitar) of the <a href=""http://www.hypercubemusic.org/home-1.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HYPERCUBE</a> ensemble, creating a new piece to be premiered during the festival. I will also be participating in a speed-writing assignment (creating a new piece in a matter of days) during the festival for performance by the <a href=""http://www.beostringquartet.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Beo String Quartet</a>.</p>
<p align=""left"">Quality recordings of performances by professional musicians are <i>almost</i> priceless for emerging composers like myself. And receiving the feedback and instruction of these and the other two ensembles (the <a href=""https://redclaysaxophonequartet.weebly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Red Clay Saxophone Quartet</a> and the flute duo <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Zonda-Duo-162762633779045/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Duo Zonda</a>) about writing for their instruments is similarly valuable. Last summer, I attended Zae Munn’s Summer Composition Intensive at St. Mary’s College in South Bend Indiana, where I received advice from Dr. Courtney Miller, the guest oboist. She told me that music that <i>looks</i> boring on the page can <i>sound</i> incredible in the hands of a performer, and that tidbit of wisdom has significantly altered my composing for the better.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p align=""left"">While I would, ideally, love to fund opportunities like this myself, I need your help to take part in the Composer’s Workshop. The total cost, including tuition for the Workshop, housing, meals, and travel, is roughly <strong>$2800</strong>.</p>

</div></div>","Summary
My name is William Peacock (a.k.a. Tony), a Mississippi-born composer who finished his ungraduated degree at Belhaven University under Dr. Andrew Mark Sauerwein and currently resides in Indiana, finishing his Master’s degree in Music Composition at Butler University under Dr. Frank Felice and Dr. Michael Schelle.
I recently applied for and was accepted to take part in the Composition Workshop of the Charlotte New Music Festival. The CNMF is a two-week celebration of new music held at various locations across Charlotte, North Carolina, partnering with many fine ensembles and living composers to make new music across the city. The Composition Workshop is held during the festival and includes:
- Two professional performances of your music:
1) A commissioned work written for the festival.
2) A speedwriting assignment, written and performed during the festival.
- Opportunity to work with guest musicians in rehearsing your music.
- High-quality audio and video recording of the performances.
- Option to perform an additional piece on our “New Music Open Mic Night.”
- Lectures by eminent guest composers and musicians.
- Two private lessons with guest composers.
- Admission to all festival concerts.
- Making new friends and being part of a supportive artistic community.
- New professional headshot photos for portfolio/website use.
While everything above is wonderful, especially the lessons with the composers and rubbing shoulders with fellow artists, I’m most excited about working with the professional musicians. I have been asked to write for Erin Rodgers (saxophone) and Jay Sorce (classical and electric guitar) of the HYPERCUBE ensemble, creating a new piece to be premiered during the festival. I will also be participating in a speed-writing assignment (creating a new piece in a matter of days) during the festival for performance by the Beo String Quartet.
Quality recordings of performances by professional musicians are almost priceless for emerging composers like myself. And receiving the feedback and instruction of these and the other two ensembles (the Red Clay Saxophone Quartet and the flute duo Duo Zonda) about writing for their instruments is similarly valuable. Last summer, I attended Zae Munn’s Summer Composition Intensive at St. Mary’s College in South Bend Indiana, where I received advice from Dr. Courtney Miller, the guest oboist. She told me that music that looks boring on the page can sound incredible in the hands of a performer, and that tidbit of wisdom has significantly altered my composing for the better.

What We Need & What You Get
While I would, ideally, love to fund opportunities like this myself, I need your help to take part in the Composer’s Workshop. The total cost, including tuition for the Workshop, housing, meals, and travel, is roughly $2800.
What I will be covering from this total is housing (at UNC Charlotte with a room mate) during the Festival ($600), meals ($200), travel ($100), and the less tangible lack of an income for two weeks.
Ideally, my wife and I would like to raise $2000 to cover the tuition for the Workshop ($1885), taxes, and the cost of using IndyGoGo’s platform. If we do not meet that goal (and do not experience a sudden windfall during the campaign), your contributions will be kept separate from our general finances as a down payment on the next professional development opportunity. Perks (see below) will, if at all possible, be fulfilled regardless of the outcome.  
Perks for Donating
Sarah (my lovely wife) and I would like to offer you rewards for certain amounts of donations; incentives and “thank you’s” for giving. Those are...

-$5+ A Sincere, Handwritten Thank-You Card
Sincerely expressed gratitude for your contribution, and, most likely, some doodling in the margins. Like all good artists do. Every contribution matters!
MUSIC:

-$15+ Score of Guitar and Saxophone Duet for Erin and Jay of HYPERCUBE

You'll receive a signed, well-engraved score of the work I'll be speed-writing during the festival for the Beo String Quartet, as well as a link to its performance.
-$25+ BOTH Scores!
You'll receive BOTH the above scores, signed and with links to their performances! Double the music, double the fun!
-$300+ New Music Written for You!
Commission me! I will write a new piece of music for you, featuring 1-3 instruments, 3-7 minutes in length, and I will arrange its performance! You'll receive a well-engraved score bearing your name (or whoever you'd would like to dedicate the piece to) below the piece's title and receive a digital copy of its performance.
(These will be completed and performed during 2018 and 2019. Instrumental preferences, the use of text(s), etc., we will sort out together beforehand.)

<h2><strong>WHO IS IT?</strong></h2>
<p>We are Von Wildenhaus from Seattle, WA. In the early-mid ‘10s in NYC, I released mostly instrumental records and cassettes as Ben von Wildenhaus and Ben von Wildenhaus with Professional Band. After moving to the Puget Sound I reconnected with my favorite musicians and weirdos from Bellingham, Jon Sampson (saxophone, piano, guitars), Andru Creature (suitcase kit), and Aaron Harmonson (bass, synths). Where the east coast professional band’s sound was crisp, studio, muso, and elegant, the northwest band developed an organic burble, fluid and breathing, burping, dreaming, and sometimes screaming in sleep. Everything changed when the vocalist and performer Amanda Bloom, another creature of Bellingham’s haunts, joined us. We focused on writing songs with Amanda. It was pop noir, broken machinery, pink sunsets, heavy vibes, and life in psychotic litewaves.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>The first six songs we wrote are big ones – life, death, apocalypse, love, and the epic sadness of a walmart parking lot. Each is a fine brew of melody, feeling, and vibe aged in the late hours of dark Seattle bars. We began recording slowly, track by track, at Aaron’s house off Aurora Ave in winter. Amanda stood in the cold wood room and bared their soul. We added new noises to these organic recordings, and kept adding and subtracting until each was done.</p>
<p>Doug Krebs (another Bellingham specter) mastered the record. Two paintings by Matthew F Fisher adorn the front and back of the vinyl jacket. An original metal logo by Christopher Baird states the name. We almost called it:</p>
<p><strong><i>EASY LISTENING FOR DEMONS</i></strong></p>
<p>but we want you to know the songs are meant to bring you hope and love so we call it:</p>
<h3><i>EVERYTHING IN FLOWER</i></h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHY ARE YOU HERE?</h2>
<p>We, the fine people of Von Wildenhaus, humbly ask you, our fan, our friend, our colleague, to help put EVERYTHING IN FLOWER on quality virgin black vinyl. Yes, it will live on the internet most likely until society crumbles. But these 6 songs, 2 sprawling sides, should be held in the hand, the cover art considered, the needle slowly wearing the grooves until it plays like a conversation with an old friend. We want you to love it, not just hear it. This is how we express our love to you. And, in the end, when the data centers in the deserts of northern California are nothing but dead architecture, the guts salvaged and the doors wide open, we want this Von Wildenhaus record to remain as an artifact, its melodies and words, though distorted with time and translation, played to the children and family around a modest bonfire of Ikea furniture and plastic bottles. Can you please help us realize our dream?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>HOW MUCH?</h2>
<p>We would like to press 500 copies of EVERYTHING IN FLOWER and only enough T-shirts to fulfill this pre-order.  Remaining copies of the album will fund our touring efforts in the US and Europe.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHAT ARE THE SONGS?</h2>

<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Sample lyric: “A grown man on a child’s bike…”</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Sample chord change: D° | Fm | Dm | G</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Fun fact: Every August across the great northwest region of the US, forest fires smog the skies for hundreds of miles, creating unsafe air and making the sky turn bright pink.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;""> </p>
<ol><li value=""2"">DRONES</li></ol>
<p>Sample lyric: “Your dick, your chest, your neck, your head / Are lying in the middle of the bed.”</p>
<p>Sample chord change: C| Ab|F| E</p>
<p>Fun fact: “Zenana” is Palestinian slang for Israeli drones. It is an onomatopoeia that describes the omnipresent buzzing sound in the skies over Gaza, as well as a dismissive term for a nagging wife.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol><li value=""3"">FLOWERS</li></ol>
<p>Sample lyric: “The dawn breaks / prepares a bloom / its perfume / is your blood.”</p>
<p>Sample chord change: C|C/Ab|F6|Asus4A</p>
<p>Fun fact: We wrote this song for a Northwest Film Forum grant (which we ultimately lost to Zen Mother) to live score a famous Mexican film that rhymes with “Spicoli fountain.”</p>
<p> </p>
<ol><li value=""4"">SUMMER’S DREAM</li></ol>
<p>Sample lyric: “Take my hand / if I could never dance again / you could never see me fall.”</p>
<p>Sample chord change: Bb|F#maj7|Bb|F#maj7|C#maj7| B|Bbsus4|Bb</p>
<p>Fun Fact: It turns out, when you spend hours learning a melodic phrase backwards on the sax so you can record it, reverse it, and layer on top of the regular melody, the results are underwhelming and hardly worth the effort. A recording of a saxophone played backwards sounds nearly indistinguishable from the instrument being played forward.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol><li value=""5"">FAREWELL</li></ol>
<p>Sample lyric: “You are the morning sun / you are the shepherd’s spring / you are the sound of rain on wheat.”</p>
<p>Sample chord change: Cm|F|Bb|G7</p>
<p>Fun fact: The chorus of this song borrows a translated line from the song Isırgan Otu by the famous Kurdish Alevi singer and songwriter Kıvırcık Ali.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol><li value=""6"">LOW GREY</li></ol>
<p>Sample lyric: “The sirens in red / awash in low grey / and the feet falling slow in a walmart parade.”</p>
<p>Sample chord change:C| Gm| F|C#|Fm</p>
<p>Fun fact: We are ultimately all alone in this world.</p>

Sample lyric: “The dawn breaks / prepares a bloom / its perfume / is your blood.”
Sample chord change: C|C/Ab|F6|Asus4A
Fun fact: We wrote this song for a Northwest Film Forum grant (which we ultimately lost to Zen Mother) to live score a famous Mexican film that rhymes with “Spicoli fountain.”
 
SUMMER’S DREAM
Sample lyric: “Take my hand / if I could never dance again / you could never see me fall.”
Sample chord change: Bb|F#maj7|Bb|F#maj7|C#maj7| B|Bbsus4|Bb
Fun Fact: It turns out, when you spend hours learning a melodic phrase backwards on the sax so you can record it, reverse it, and layer on top of the regular melody, the results are underwhelming and hardly worth the effort. A recording of a saxophone played backwards sounds nearly indistinguishable from the instrument being played forward.
 
FAREWELL
Sample lyric: “You are the morning sun / you are the shepherd’s spring / you are the sound of rain on wheat.”
Sample chord change: Cm|F|Bb|G7
Fun fact: The chorus of this song borrows a translated line from the song Isırgan Otu by the famous Kurdish Alevi singer and songwriter Kıvırcık Ali.
 
LOW GREY
Sample lyric: “The sirens in red / awash in low grey / and the feet falling slow in a walmart parade.”
Sample chord change:C| Gm| F|C#|Fm
Fun fact: We are ultimately all alone in this world.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

If you’re here, you’ve probably seen us play or heard our music or maybe just like Googling different body parts/adjectives. That’s weird of you, but we’re not here to judge—we’re here to ask for some help. </p><p>For the last five years, we’ve been playing music and touring and recording albums. For the last two and a half years, we’ve done so under a record label. We put out our first album as a full-band (called <i>Will This Do?</i>) in January of 2018, and people seemed to like it! From the touring (and merch-slinging) we did on that record we were able to put together some money and go back to the studio to record another batch of songs with our wonderful producer Tom Beaujour. We got them mixed and mastered and then sent them to our label and got set to release them as a new record in the spring of 2020. </p><p>Pretty proud of ourselves—both for how the songs came out and for the fact that we raised the money ourselves by playing an insane amount of shows (which we mostly booked ourselves)—we sat back and looked forward to our impending release date. <a href=""https://www.stereogum.com/2064521/adult-mom-tiny-engines-breach-of-contract/news/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">But then, in the fall of 2019, something happened.</a> We don’t want to rehash anything here, but the upshot is that we found ourselves left with few other options than releasing our new album independently. So that's what we decided to do.</p><p>The only obstacle that stood in our way was the fact that our old label had already pressed 500 copies of the new record. After some negotiating, we worked out an agreement to go our separate ways and purchase back the pressed records at cost. Unfortunately, that many records costs a lot of money—money that none of us have individually. And so, we come to you—friends, fans, folks who Google body parts—to ask you to help us cover the production cost and give this record the last extra push it needs to get out into the world. What does that mean? It’s pretty simple: this fundraiser is essentially an early pre-order for the fully completed, fully pressed new Long Neck record: <i>World’s Strongest Dog</i>, which officially comes out April 10, 2020. Hooray! </p><p><strong>WORLD’S STRONGEST DOG</strong></p><p>In the two years since <i>Will This Do?</i>, we’ve done a lot. We’ve played shows in more than 40 of the 50 states (plus Canada!), toured with some incredible bands (gobbinjr, Field Mouse, and Adult Mom, to name a few), and grown in leaps and bounds as musicians and as people. <i>World’s Strongest Dog</i> is the culmination of that growth. </p><p>It’s an album about learning to accept yourself, holding yourself accountable, and leaving behind bad habits. It’s about realizing that you’re always still growing and that there isn’t any endpoint you’re supposed to reach. It’s about fearing the unknown and finding the strength to explore it. And, at the risk of tooting our own horns (guitars? whatever), the record is chock-full of our most explosive and musically adept playing to date.</p><p>But don’t just take our word for it! Here’s what <i>She Shreds</i> magazine’s Cynthia Schemmer had to say: “[Songwriter Lily Mastrodimos] meditates on the last two years of her life—from friendships and romance, to getting older and changing habits—to craft an elegant reflection of self that poses maturity and awareness, along with an evident evolution in both lyrics and musicianship.” </p><p>And here’s what our producer, Tom, had to say: “It sounds fucking sick, dude!” </p><p>And here’s what Lily had to say: “I think we did an alright job!”</p><p>And if none of that's enough to convince you, take a listen for yourself to the album's first single, ""Campfire"":</p><div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yOZmT96iUo4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div></div><div> </div><p><strong>WHAT DO I GET? AND WHERE’S THE MONEY GOING? </strong></p><p>As we said earlier, this fundraiser is basically pre-order for <i>World’s Strongest Dog</i>. That means that the cost of the perks is what we’d charge at the merch table—plus a few exclusive items we’ll get to later. The money we raise is going to a few things: </p><p>500 Records: $1,814.50</p><p>Test Pressing/Deposit: $549.25</p><p>Imprint Jackets/Inserts: $720</p><p>Packaging: $175 </p><p>Design Work: $100</p><p>Platform Fees: $400</p><p>This brings us to $3,758.75. The remaining $241.25 will go toward things like gas (to go pick up the records from the presser in D.C.) and the upfront cost for manufacturing some of our perks. </p><p>Speaking of perks, we have a few fundraiser exclusives that we’re excited to offer: </p><p>-Items like pins and custom <i>World’s Strongest Dog</i> trophies that will only be offered through this campaign</p><p>-A nice spaghetti dinner (we cook for you!)</p><p>-A private live performance of <i>World’s Strongest Dog</i> PLUS a secret bonus set in which we will “Roll The Dice” (which will mean something to you if you’ve ever seen us at a house show. Otherwise it will remain a secret until you pony up, player—we promise it’s worth it!)</p><p>-Lily writes a song for you! </p><p>-Go birdwatching with us (or just Lily, since she’s the only one in the band who's a member of the NJ Audubon Society)!</p><p><strong>WHAT IF WE DON’T HIT OUR GOAL? </strong></p><p>If we don’t hit our goal, you’ll still get your rewards when the album is released. Like we said, the records have already been pressed and we’re excited for the world to hear them! Fortunately, IndieGoGo allows you to collect whatever you do raise if you fall short of your goal—we’ll just be eating a lot of rice and beans for a while/maybe forever if we don’t make it. So if you’re wary about Long Neck’s ability to make money, you have a lot in common with our families/the record industry in general. But also you have nothing to worry about. </p><p><strong>WHAT IF WE HIT OUR GOAL? </strong></p><p>First off, we’ll be thrilled! It means so much to us all that so many people have supported our music in so many different ways—whether it’s coming to shows or buying records or just not shutting off the algorithmically generated playlist when “Mine/Yours” comes on. If we do hit our goal any additional money raised will go toward the things money always goes toward in a band: paying for the van rental for the next tour, the cost of recording the eventual next album, and maybe staying in a motel or two on the road at some point (AKA the dream). </p><p>Thanks for listening! </p><p>Long Neck</p></div>","Hello! Our names are Lily and Evan and Alex and John, and together we’re a band called Long Neck.

Fortunately, IndieGoGo allows you to collect whatever you do raise if you fall short of your goal—we’ll just be eating a lot of rice and beans for a while/maybe forever if we don’t make it. So if you’re wary about Long Neck’s ability to make money, you have a lot in common with our families/the record industry in general. But also you have nothing to worry about. WHAT IF WE HIT OUR GOAL? First off, we’ll be thrilled! It means so much to us all that so many people have supported our music in so many different ways—whether it’s coming to shows or buying records or just not shutting off the algorithmically generated playlist when “Mine/Yours” comes on. If we do hit our goal any additional money raised will go toward the things money always goes toward in a band: paying for the van rental for the next tour, the cost of recording the eventual next album, and maybe staying in a motel or two on the road at some point (AKA the dream). Thanks for listening! Long Neck",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>WOODEN ELEPHANT records RADIOHEAD</h3>
<p>We are Wooden Elephant and we make totally acoustic versions of classic electronic-based albums.</p>
<p>Aside from the musical material, our acoustic version of <i>Kid A</i> owes itself to Radiohead in another way: Wooden Elephant violist/composer Ian Anderson regularly works with the London Contemporary Orchestra, and from 2014 we collaborated with Jonny Greenwood in a series of projects which culminated in a tour of Europe with Jonny’s string music, and our subsequent appearance on Radiohead’s latest album, <i>A Moon Shaped Pool</i>. Along the way I got to witness Jonny’s constant experimentation with string techniques, some of which — such as detuned strings and Pacay bean shakers — made it into our version of <i>Kid A</i>. But it was more his overall mindset of always asking “but what happens if you do this?”, and “what happens if you hit it with that?”, which really had a big impact on the way that I approach composition and arrangements in general.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE PLAN</h3>
<p>We are asking for your help to fund the recording of our acoustic version of <i>Kid A</i>, for release on Berlin-based label, Backlash Records. We developed our version of <i>Kid A</i> in 2018, and since then have been tweaking and perfecting it. We now feel that we are ready to commit it to record, for release on <i>Kid A</i>'s 20th anniversary next October.</p>
<p>We have scheduled our 5-day recording session for 14-18 January 2020, but in order to go ahead with it we need to raise a certain amount of money. We have already raised funding to cover the fees of our amazing recording engineer and producer, Johann Günther, but we still need to raise money to cover studio hire, travel, accommodation, and a short behind-the-scenes video to document the process.</p>
<p>If we do not manage to reach our entire goal then we will have to cancel the short film, which will be a real shame as it will help enormously with marketing and promotion. But we need to be realistic and we will be incredibly grateful for any help at all.</p>
<p>There are a range of perks you can choose which range from £5 digital downloads of an exclusive recording not available to the general public, through pieces of equipment that we use during the <i>Kid A</i> recording sessions, right up to one-on-one lessons with members of Wooden Elephant! But you are also very welcome to donate without selecting any perk, save for the reward of the warm glow which accompanies a good deed well done.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLANGES</h3>
<p>There are many risks associated with recording and releasing any album, and when you're releasing your own acoustic contemporary classical take on one of the all-time great alternative-rock albums, that is certainly no different! People who know and love <i>Kid A</i> will have their own personal connections and associations with the album, favourite songs, and possibly very strong-held views on what is acceptable to do with the music (we speak as five of these very people!). One of the hardest things we will need to get across to our listeners is our total love and respect for this amazing music. Our intention has never been to 'mess' with the music, but to present it in the totally different (and we hope fascinating) context of the classical music live performance tradition, adapted very specifically for our particular set of instruments.</p>
<p>And then there's the unforgiving nature of the recording studio...! Every little mistake is audible under the microphones, so we will all need to be on the top of our game for the entire 5-day recording period. We have performed <i>Kid A</i> together enough times, and we will make sure that individually we can play our parts perfectly. It will be exhausting and at times infuriating, but ultimately exhilarating and a total honour to bring to our own unique take one of the great albums of all time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>OTHER WAYS TO HELP</h3>
<p>We totally understand if you are a fan of <i>Kid A </i>or Wooden Elephant (or both) and would like to help but are not in a position to spare any money (believe us – as freelance musicians we have all been there many many times!!). Fear not! You can help spread the word about our project by sharing this crowdfunding campaign on social media, or doing it the old-fashioned way of talking to a real human who might also be interested. We appreciate all forms of help and support :)</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Kissing Candice is a masked nu-metal/industrial band based out of New York with members from all around the United States! We released our first full length album through Victory Records and followed up with an EP through Stay Sick Recordings. However, we have decided to go back to our DIY roots and handle everything for our next full length on our own. This album is entirely funded by ourselves and the fans. It will be a true reflection of who we are and what we want to create, not affected by ANY outside sources! We have no label, no management, no team. Just 5 masked madmen trying to put out the best album they possibly can!</p>
<p>However, as you may be aware. Being in an underground band doesn't make you rich by any means. We all work hard to do this and invest most of our time and money into this band to make music for you that we love. Unfortunately, this means we can't possibly fund this album totally on our own (unless we don't eat!). This is a project of passion, and this album will be no different. Since recording and releasing an album is VERY expensive, we would love the help of our devoted fan base who has supported us over our last 7 years as a band! Everyone who contributes to this project will receive very col perks and our eternal gratitude!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Kissing Candice is a hard working band. Whenever we are not touring, we are writing and working on the band, interacting with all of you, and maintaining full time jobs so we can continue to do this! Your money will help us achieve our goal of putting out a FULL album completely independent of the music industry. We are all the weirdos in this world, and we want to show everyone who WE are!</p>

<p>I am a multi-instrumentalist, but my focus is the guitar. Over the years I've played in a wide variety of bands and I've done session work for a variety of local musicians. I've toured Japan and several European countries as a hired musician, and I have contributed songs and guitar parts to a variety of documentaries and student films. I'm also a several time alumnus of Steve Vai's Vai Academy and Joe Satriani's G4 Experience. I eat, sleep, and breathe music.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago in 1998 I bought my first digital audio workstation computer and I started writing and recording my own music. By the end of 1998, I had recorded over a dozen original songs. I took my best 13 songs and called this collection <i>Kosmos</i>, and I burned about 50 copies of the album and I distributed those discs to friends and family. This was my first ""real"" album.</p>
<p>I've come a long way as a musician and home recording engineer in the last 20 years, and in more recent years when I would listen to ""Kosmos"" I couldn't help but cringe a little at the quality of that recording. I was really pushing the limits of my tools and my skills back then, and I had to cut a lot of corners because there was only so much you could do with a 450 MHz Pentium CPU and 9 GB hard drive back then.</p>
<p>This year I decided that in honor of the 20th anniversary of <i>Kosmos</i> I would re-record all of the songs using my modern gear and 20 additional years of studio knowledge. The result has been breath-taking. These songs have never sounded better and they truly deserve an official release: <i>Kosmos XX </i></p>
<h3>
<i>Kosmos XX</i> is a little different...</h3>
<p>My first two released albums, <i>Legacy</i> and <i>Juxtaposition</i> are very much instrumental guitar rock albums. However, <i>Kosmos XX</i> is much more focused on synthesizers. The original <i>Kosmos</i> was my starting point into songwriting, and stylistically it's quite varied because I was still trying to find my voice, instrumentally speaking.</p>
<p>Even though my more recent music is very guitar-centered, on both the original <i>Kosmos</i> and <i>Kosmos XX</i> only 5 of the 13 songs have any guitar at all. My early songs have a strong world-beat influence combined with ambient electronica, but there's also a little industrial and metal influence too. Many of the songs from the original <i>Kosmos</i> were re-imagined into guitar songs on my 2016 album <i>Legacy</i> so if you happen to have that album, the song titles might be the same, but the songs are <u>quite</u> different. On <i>Kosmos XX</i> I strived to stay true to the original songs, only making minor changes. If you like Tangerine Dream, Jan Hammer, or Delerium, I think you'll enjoy <i>Kosmos XX</i>.</p>
<h3>What You Get...</h3>
<p>I've put together some perks packages, and all of them result in you getting some music that I think you'll love. Click on any of the perks for more details about what you get. Remember, even if you have <u><strong>no</strong></u> interest at all in a physical CD, your pre-order of the digital album will help me fund the CD pressing.</p>
<p>If I don't reach the funding goal, contributors will still get access to the digital version of the album, but if you help me meet the funding goal, I will be able to deliver <i>Kosmos XX</i> on CD in a 4-panel full-color eco-wallet.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why a physical CD in this age of streaming?</h3>
<p>I grew up in a time where vinyl LPs were the norm. Then came cassette tapes. Then came CDs. Then came the Internet and physical media started to disappear along with record stores.</p>
<p>I used to spend hours at a time flipping through every single CD in the ""Rock"" and ""Metal"" sections of Tower Records and Borders hoping to find some rare gem to add to my music collection. The browsing itself was part of the experience.</p>
<p>But another part of the music listening experience for me is the album art. Part of my listening ritual has always included admiring the album art and reading through the liner notes as I listen to the album. I would read and re-read every lyric, every songwriting credit, every thank you, every gear endorsement, and every inside joke. I miss that aspect of the listening experience with digital-only albums.</p>
<p>I don't think I'm alone.</p>
<p>I want <i>Kosmos XX</i> to be released on physical CD to continue this experience for myself and for others who feel the same way. </p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div><p>Even if you can't or don't want to pre-order a copy of <i>Kosmos XX</i>, I would be incredibly grateful if you would share this campaign with friends or family that you think might be interested.</p></div></div>","The Quick & Dirty...
My name is Chris Stark and I'm a musician and songwriter from Hawaii. I have just finished recording, mixing, and mastering my third full-length album Kosmos XX. If you can help me reach my funding goal, I will be making the album available on physical CD in addition to the planned digital release.
PLEASE NOTE!!!
Indiegogo doesn't make it super obvious, but if you click on any of the ""perks"" listed in the right hand margin, the little boxes expand to show you a detailed list of what is included in each perk. It's not super obvious, so sorry in advance for any confusion!

<h3>What We're Doing</h3>
<p>I'm partnering with <a href=""https://flourishcreative.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Flourish Creative</a> to record a six-song EP!</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Darion Ryan Roberts, and I'm a singer-songwriter from Wichita Falls, TX.</li>
<li>My wife and I moved back to our hometown almost three years ago, and we've been learning and growing -- these are a few of the songs that have come out of this season.</li>
<li>By partnering with me, you're helping me in an enormous way. It is literally impossible without you.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe songs have power, and songs connect people.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need to raise $4,000 for tracking, production, mixing, mastering, distribution and a couple other cool merch items! </li>
<li>Perks include getting the EP two-weeks early, t-shirt, even a custom song! </li>
<li>If I don't raise all the money, I don't track all of the songs.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The difference you'd be making by supporting me is huge.<br/>This has been on my heart for a couple of years now, and I would take full advantage of the priveledge that comes with getting to release songs. I don't take this lightly, and will give all I have to releasing good art.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is honestly terrifying to me. For years I've struggled with the insecurity that comes from putting yourself out there. Music is a personal. I've always struggled with what people think about how I sing, or play. This is vulnerable. But with encouragement from those around me, I believe it's time. I'm also afraid of not raising the money. But with your help, both of these fears can be overcome.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Three of the members of Mayan Fox are related. We've been racking our brains trying to work out how we can get to Canada to see our beautiful Cousin who has been given only months to live. Then we remembered we have a band. BAND TOUR TO CANADA plan was born. So Mayan Fox have applied to play at NXNE (one of the biggest music conferences in the world) and are in the process of planning the rest of the tour. As we are an independent band everything we do is self, family and friends funded. So far we've released an album, toured NZ and played some incredible slots at festivals.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're hoping to WOW crowds throughout Canada with our infectious music and passion for playing live. We are also excited at the prospect of playing to loads of family and friends in Canada, especially our cousin Roxy.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are engaging in local fundraising for our flights and extras and are hoping to raise enough on indiegogo to get us around while we are in Canada.  We have number crunched, and will need $5000 for our tour vehicle, petrol and accommodation. Anything on top (yes we're being optimistic) will help with flight costs as we are trying to raise this individually instead of as a band! If we don't quite make our goal on indiegogo, we will still go ahead with the tour, but will have to do a lot more work locally, to cover it.</p>
<p>We are happy to sing and write you songs, send you albums, t-shirts and thank you cards for the support you give us :) Not to mention a play by play on all our activities. It's our adventure that you are all invited to be a part of! </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If funds are strapped at the moment we would still love and appreciate your support. You can help us by visiting any of our band sites and listening to our music. Just for reading this far, you have made our day and you can download a free track from the second link below:</p>
