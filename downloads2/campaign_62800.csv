<h2 dir=""ltr""><strong>Mission:</strong></h2>
<p dir=""ltr"">It is our mission to create an online community that offers sports fans the chance to generate a positive impact on the world simply by sharing their input about the sports they love. This is done in a few easy steps:</p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>1)  </strong>  We give sports fans the ability to hold sports figures accountable for their actions on or off the field. This is done by giving users the ability to create online “Fines”, or what we refer to as “Tiks”, represented as a dollar figure. Rarely is only one fan upset about something that happened, so other members of the Fantasy Fines community will be able to view the Tiks that have been created and add (UpTik) or subtract (UnTik) from the total, depending on their opinion of the offense.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>2)</strong>    When a Tik reaches a threshold sufficient to qualify as significant “social pressure”, Fantasy Fines will approach the sports figure (the Tik-E) with our users’ dissatisfaction level and offer them a chance to socially redeem themselves by donating $500.00 to charity. This action closes the Tik with the FF community, and represents the Tik-E acknowledging to the fans that their voice has been heard and that it matters.</p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">We have completed our business plan, marketing research and marketing plan along with the first phase of our website and social media outlets. Now we need your help to raise an additional $50,000 to complete our “Final Road to Launch”, which includes much needed enhancements, such as a comments section for individual Tiks, a forums section, internet and email marketing, charity awareness campaigns, etc.</p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">To thank you for your contribution, we will provide perks such as: free lifetime licenses to use our android/iphone app, free lifetime licenses to create/vote on unlimited Tiks, Fantasy Fines T-shirts, and free $20.00 Yahoo Sports Fantasy league accounts.   </p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Your contribution will help us generate funds for charities that are working toward a brighter future for the world.</p>

<p>Christian and James were watching a World Series game between the Texas Rangers and the San Francisco Giants at the 04 Lounge in Austin Texas when two outfielders were running down a fly ball but they neither collided nor caught the ball.  Essentially, both players failed to communicate while running down the pop fly thereby letting it drop into the field of play and therefore failing to do their job for which they are paid millions of dollars to perform.  Christian became so incensed that he stated that both players should be fined for failing to do their job.  After a bit of back and forth discussion about how to enforce the fines, the conversation stalled and Christian and James went on to other topics. A couple of days later James spoke with Christian about fans being able to create “fantasy fines”.  The company and concept was formed from that point forward.</p>

<p>Hey guys. Thank you all so much for your donations! But I have to admit that this all would not be possible if it wasn't for a great guy I met through Reddit. His name is Chris (Reddit handle Kings_Haven) and if it wasn't for this guy selflessly offering his time to set up a fundraiser for this cause then my family would have never set this one up for me. I respectfully declined his help but it was him who took the initiative and gave us the idea to use this site for our cause. My eternal gratitude goes out to him and he deserves all the credit for this wonderful idea. Thank you, Chris. You are a Saint among the masses!!</p>

<h3>The back story</h3>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>My name is Laura and I created this fundraiser campaign to help out my brother John, who on Sunday, 9/23/12, contracted Necrotizing Fasciitis, more commonly known as Flesh Eating Bacteria. He got this bacteria through a small cut on his right pinky finger after he put his hand in a koi pond to retrieve a football that had landed there.</p>
<p>Less than 36 hours later, John was in the ER with the bacteria quickly eating away his pinky and traveling up his arm. Ever since, he has been in the hospital undergoing blood tests and antibiotic treatments. John has been to the local ER, 2 doctors, a hand specialist, a plastic surgeon and an infectious disease doctor.</p>
<p>Recently he has learned that the tip of his pinky has turned gangrene and he will need a partial amputation. He has documented his experience and has received a lot of online support from the <em>Reddit.com</em> community. His album can be found here (WARNING: some of the images may be disturbing):</p>
<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/a/CuxUZ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/CuxUZ</a></p>
<p>My brother has received tons and tons of support and kind words from other Redditors. He has provided an invaluable service to those that have shared his story, including many microbiology students who will be using his case in their studies and classes.</p>
<p>I have created this campaign in hopes of collecting donations to help pay down some of his medical costs. My brother has only recently elected medical benefits and does not curently have a policy with his insurance company. Therefore, all expenses will be out-of-pocket.</p>
<p>Each and every contribution will go towards the medical bills accrued during his treatment and rehab. My brother works as contractor and makes his money based on the hours he works. This unfortunate event has put my brother out of work while he is in the hospital and therefore has no income. Your contributions will greatly alleviate the financial stress for my brother and my family as a whole once he begins his recovery.</p>

<b><br/></b><p><b>Simple and reliable for a safe ride</b> <br/></p>
<p>
milKit is a new system for measuring and
refilling sealant in tubeless tires. Unlike traditional tires, tubeless tires
don’t use an inner tube. The tire seals directly on the rim. A sealant (milk)
is filled into the tire before installation and seals punctures and leaks. The
main benefit of tubeless systems is being able to ride at low air pressure for
better traction without getting flats, because there is no tube to pinch. Plus you
save weight. The maintenance of tubeless tires was tedious – until now. milKit
allows a precise and easy measurement of the sealant without removing the tire
from the rim and releasing the air pressure. milKit makes riding tubeless systems
reliable, simple and safe – plus no more dirty hands.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The core functionality of
milKit are the patented valves. They are compatible with all standard rim
types. A rubber flap prevents sealant from clogging the valve and allows
super-fast inflation without a valve core. </p>

Sick
of flat tires when biking? Us too. That’s why we invented milKit, the Swiss
made solution for easy measuring and refilling sealant in tubeless tires – which
means you can spend less time fixing tires and more time on the bike.
Our campaign at Indiegogo has successfully ended. We have achieved our goal: milKit is available on the market. Thank you all for your great support! 
Here you find a list of online shops on where to buy milKit: www.milKit.bike/shop


 benefits at a glance

easy to use kit for tubeless systems
no more dirty hands
no more valve clogging
makes tubeless systems reliable


milKit makes tubeless tires maintenance clean, quick and simple. Enjoy a safe ride!

Simple and reliable for a safe ride 

milKit is a new system for measuring and
refilling sealant in tubeless tires. Unlike traditional tires, tubeless tires
don’t use an inner tube. The tire seals directly on the rim. A sealant (milk)
is filled into the tire before installation and seals punctures and leaks. The
main benefit of tubeless systems is being able to ride at low air pressure for
better traction without getting flats, because there is no tube to pinch. Plus you
save weight. The maintenance of tubeless tires was tedious – until now. milKit
allows a precise and easy measurement of the sealant without removing the tire
from the rim and releasing the air pressure. milKit makes riding tubeless systems
reliable, simple and safe – plus no more dirty hands.







The core functionality of
milKit are the patented valves. They are compatible with all standard rim
types. A rubber flap prevents sealant from clogging the valve and allows
super-fast inflation without a valve core. 




















No flats
Better traction
Less weight








   



How to use milKit

Check out our product video
to see how easy tubeless system maintenance is with milKit.




Push the applicator into the valve


Let the sealant flow into the syringe and check remaining sealant


Fill the missing amount of sealant into the tire












Approved by the pros

Christoph Sauser: “The milKit valves are great as they don’t clog anymore.”
World Champion, World Cup Champion, Olympic Medalist
Ralph Näf: “The valves are awesome; I save weight of excess sealant in the race.”
World Champion
We received very positive
feedbacks to our prototypes from the major players of the tubeless industry
including tire manufacturers and sealant producers. Professional mountain
bikers like mountain biking legend Thomas Frischknecht tested and liked our
prototypes. milKit was also tested by champion Christoph Sauser  under very rough conditions at Cape Epic
2015, one of the most prestigious mountain bike races in the world.

Masks</p><p>3.) <strong><u>Washing your hands</u> (95% of people do not properly wash their hands!)</strong></p><p>Only one of those existed prior to the pandemic.

That's when Covid-19 hit and we realized our motivation - Helping Others. Three things capture the attention of public health officials:1.) Social Distancing2.) Masks3.) Washing your hands (95% of people do not properly wash their hands!)Only one of those existed prior to the pandemic. As we did some research, we realized we have a seriously FILTHY problem on our hands! Before coronavirus, up to 1 million people die each year related to poor hand washing. In addition, it's costing our economy roughly $800 billion in sick days and lost productivity, raising the cost of healthcare, and eliminating disposable income, it's a loss for everybody. How we plan to fix it  - We decided to revolutionize the way businesses can motivate and ensure it's staff are properly washing their hands which will save lives, money, and generate new revenue streams and marketing campaigns. Making $$$ for businesses seems a bit insensitive as motivation, but we realize the only way to fix our problem and change our society was to make the solution affordable, marketable, and save money. The cost of the system has to make business sense to pass along the benefits to the folks that matter the most, us!  Why does hand washing need to be revolutionized? It's because of the lack of accountability and assistance. We have two primary groups: folks that don't care to wash their hands and need better accountability than a sign saying ""employees must wash hands"" and folks that don't realize they are not washing their hands properly and need assistance. ​We created a mission to be the leading name in safety and hygiene automation and fix the problem using IoT (Internet of Things). Our physical RFID/WiFi device, the SudHub™, is at the core of the BandIt Bands system. It displays a cycle of vibrant LED icons and a blinking LED circle to engage and assist in proper hand washing. It can also play tunes and chimes to help the visually impaired. The SudHub™ works with our BandIt Bands and a guests' personal devices. Our system then reports back to the company weekly to identify and incentivize top scorers, and check in with those missing the mark. SudHub™​Our flagship, revolutionary device that educates, aids, and ensures proper hand washing. There's a lot to like about the SudHub from the sleek design, energy efficiency, and durable build!BandIt Bands™​RFID bands that work with the SudHub™ used to identify users. They are lightweight, durable, recyclable, reusable, easy to clean, and marketable. Bands come in many colors and custom logos can be added. RFIDs can be pendants, badges, etc. for industries that cannot use bands. The Design -The design is carefully crafted to be installed on both countertops and walls. We have a future design without WiFi using just battery power to be installed virtually anywhere for just consumers aid, including portal hand wash stations, that will work with personal products and integrate into health applications.  The design is a brushed metal side, LED lights, and an engaging light ring to aid in timing. The power source is a low voltage, energy efficient plug. It was built side-by-side with former Apple engineers to ensure premium build, durability, and maximum functionality!  Customization -The SudHub™ itself is versatile with the ability to come in other colors, customizable faceplates, and a selection of chimes and tunes!  Why the name BandIt Bands?  ​We originally thought ""Halo"" sounded cool, since it keeps you safe, but then we realized raccoons make more sense. They constantly wash their hands, their name translates to ""washing bear,"" and they also look like bandits with their adorable faces. Instead of ""Halo"", we decided BandIt Bands™. The name relates to both our iconic raccoon, ""BandIt"", and our simple directions on how to use our system, ""Band It"", as in band your hands!   Risks and challengesOur budgeting constraints remain in manufacturing and marketing.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>With Albio-product we will give paramedics
and ER’s a tool to get accurate information for making live saving decisions in
treatments and medications. Naturally, through fast treatment and right
decisions by professionals, patients will gain the greatest value from Albio.
 </p>
<p>Alcohol is the most used drug in the world.
More than 45 % of the paramedics’ and ER’s patients have been drinking. Alcohol
has also a great influence in treatment methods and medications. Yet, so far
the only reliable way to get information about the blood-alcohol level has been
clinical lab test.  Unfortunately, clinical lab test takes time, is
expensive and requires special instrument and skilled staff.</p>
<p>Albio gives reliable result
in less than 20 seconds, is at least 10 times less expensive, and doesn’t
require special skills nor expensive clinical lab instruments. </p>

<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Q. How Albio is
helping paramedics in patient medication?</p>
<p>A. Several
medicines, typically pain-killers, react with alcohol. Thus it is very
important to know what the blood-alcohol level for dosage is.</p>
<p><span>Q. Why breath analyzers are not good enough?</span></p>
<p>A.  Breath
analyzers are measuring alcohol form air-flow, which is not the same as
blood-level. Breath air-flow is effected by recent drinking and smoking and
even eating though the residues of mouth mucous membrane.</p>
<p><span>Q. Why breath analyzers are often not utilitarian?</span></p>
<p><span>A. Patients who are unconscious or who have a bad
trauma or who are hysterical are not able to blow.</span></p>
<p>Q. Is Albio
usable for police in drunken drive controlling?</p>
<p>A. Technically
yes. That will need some changes in legislation and we have not started that
process yet.</p>
<p>Q. Albio has a
battery, how long does it last and can user change it?</p>
<p>A. With one
battery you can make about 1 500 tests. Albio gives a warning in good time
before the battery is low and user can easily change the standard-type battery.</p>
<p>Q. Albio is
giving the result to the screen. Is the result also stored into memory?</p>
<p>A. Yes, Albio
has a memory for more than 940 test results. The data-exchange can be done by
standard USB-cable connection.</p>
<p>Q. The price of
clinical lab alcohol test is between 25 – 35 USD during the day time. What is
the price of Albio meter and test-strip?</p>
<p>A. The estimated
price for Albio meter is 200 USD and to test-strip 3 USD.</p>
<p>Q. What is the
status of Albio CE and FDA approval?</p>
<p>A. Albio meter
has CE and FDA marking and approval. Test-strips are estimated to have
CE-approval during next coming months. Test-strips FDA approval will be planned
during this campaign.</p>
<p>Q. Is Albio
operating in the same way than glucose meters?</p>
<p>A. Yes it is
just as simple and easy to use. The sample is drawn from the fingertip in same
way than in glucose meters. Albio test-strips are also used in “glucose-meter
way”.</p>
<p>Q. Do I have to
send Albio meter to maintenance for calibration?</p>
<p>A. No, Albio

Who We Are:
We are Marc Dalesandro & Scott MacDonald, two veteran comic-book readers and role-players from Nova Scotia, Canada.
What we have:
Heroics is a Superhero themed Table Top Role Playing Game.
For those of you unfamiliar with this type of game, it is played around a table with a group of friends who want to collaboratively tell a story about Superheroes. Each person creates their own Hero to represent, and one plays the general narrator, guiding the players through the story, using the rule book to help set players boundaries and abilities.  Have a look at this link for a full explanation.
Our game is based on a d100 system, which means that you will always be rolling 2 10 sided dice, or a 100 sided die.  We have created a large variety of superpowers for you to choose from for your character, around 60 to date, but one of the key concepts that we both very strongly push is that the rules are there to support the characters, so if you want to do something that is not in the rules, just ask and the person running the game should create it for you, with you.
One of the things that makes our game different, and better, than others is a very robust Critical and Fumble system, as well as lots of information on how powerful you are, and can become.  Most Superpowers have detailed tables to show you how your powers will scale as you continue to grow stronger.
Why did we create it?
In 2002, we created the first edition of Heroics, a superhero role-playing game that arose from our mutual frustration with the bland, disinteresting, and just plain unfun superhero RPGs out there at the time.
Heroics has evolved through four editions since then (4th edition source book shown above), and has been played by small, dedicated gaming groups in our home province of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Maine.
We have used free software to create and edit the game so far, and low-cost options such as Hero Machine for the artwork in our game manual and on our wiki & weebly, which can be found at http://heroicsuniverse.wikispaces.com/ and http://beheroic.weebly.com/ .
Why the Campaign?
This campaign is to raise money for the 5th edition of Heroics, which will feature original artwork, professional printing and binding, and an initial print run of 500 hardback source books.
By using Indiegogo to fund the book, we can keep the prices very low - aiming for $10-$20 cover price, which is about one-half what similar RPGs sell for.
What you Get:
As a contributor, you can receive our thanks in the source book by name, have a character in our universe named after you, and receive a free copy of the finished Heroics source book.
We have set this Indiegogo campaign up as a flexible-funding project. Should we fail to reach our goal, we will still use funds received to complete and print the Heroics RPG, though we will be forced to scale down our ambitions to some degree. Such a scale-down might include black-and-white printing, softback rather than hardcover source book, and less original artwork. All perks will still be awarded to contributors who meet the funding levels outlined.
Please be assured that the 5th edition of Heroics *is* being completed and printed. You will get to play this game. The only question is what form the final product will take. We'd like to make it as polished and professional as possible.

<p> </p>
<p><span>This may sound like a funny headline, but our mission is very serious.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>We are creating the world's largest condom to draw attention to the HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa. In conjunction with this world record, we will be distributing ONE MILLION condoms and education materials to rural areas of Zambia, where help is needed most!</span></p>
<p><span>Our goal is to break the world record and hold a press conference in Africa to give the world a wake up call! At the same time, our efforts will save lives through our direct involvement and distribution to the people of Africa.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>HOW THIS GOT STARTED</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Hi, My name is Atul Gupta.  I live in California, and am as American as the next guy. One of things that is different about me is that I grew up in Africa, Zambia to be specific.  I love what my life is today, and this would not have been possible without my childhood in Zambia. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>My heart bleeds for the people of Zambia and their suffering. The Global HIV/AIDS crisis has affected Zambia in a huge way. In addition, traditional beliefs make it hard to fight domestic abuse and violence against women &amp; children. The infant mortality rate is at almost 10%, while almost 30% of all people under 18 are affected by HIV/AIDS.  The life expectancy is at a mere 51.  Zambia receives a lot of international aid &amp; support, however, it almost never reaches the people in greatest need.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Now that I am settled in life, and have some clarity on who I am, I want to complete my life circle.  I want to raise awareness of the HIV/AIDS crisis in Zambia, by creating the world’s largest condom for Zambia. At the same time, I want to distribute millions of condoms, educating people about HIV/AIDS prevention, living with HIV/AIDS, and information on available treatment options in Zambia.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>We need your support in the manufacture of the world’s largest condom, and donations of condoms. We also need your financial support for the transport and delivery of these condoms. Each condom that reaches someone, will save someone from potentially contracting HIV. This is a war that only be fought, 1 instance at a time.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Remember that, your gift is going to change the lives of people without means or a voice. People who need and deserve support, but are not able to receive for many reasons.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Each and everyone of us is part of the same fabric of life.  While we may not want to think bout it, but what happens across the globe has an impact on us and our lives.  What does one do when a garment is coming undone or damaged in someway? We repair it.  This is what you will be doing, repairing some of the rips in this garment we call humanity.</span></p>

<p><br/>Most people know someone who has been sexually assaulted.  Whether it was your parent, your friend, your teacher, your sibling, your classmate, you teammate, or yourself. Sexual assault has touched all of us.  Slutwalk is an opportunity to stand, walk, chant, and shout our powerful opposition to the practice of sexual harassment and assault and its commonplace appearance in our society.  It's a place to stand strongly and unconditionally with all survivors of sexual assault. It is a time to say that it is never, under, any circumstances, the fault of the victim, and to show solidarity to all who have experienced sexual assault. It is a place to express our demand for control over our own bodies, physical and sexual space.  It is a place to condemn the policies that embolden and condone a rape culture and to call out their disproportionate impact on the LGBTQ community, poor and working class people, people of color, immigrants, incarcerated individuals, soldiers, people who engage in sex work, and individuals with physical or mental disabilities.  Slutwalk is a place to demand a world free from sexual assault, a place to discuss, think, and debate about what type of women’s rights, gay rights, and gender equality movement we want, and decide what direction we as a community want to walk in.</p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am a registered nurse working on my master's degree, and I am excited you are here to read more about the work I will do in Myanmar. My goal is to raise $2,240, so I may volunteer to address any health concerns and supply any basic neccessities in small community in Myanmar.</p>
<p>My belief as an active citizen is to serve locally as well as globally. I became involved internationally when I studied abroad and when I visited my roots in Vietnam. It opened my eyes to many issues that we take for granted here in the United States. I have since dedicatd myself through my career to live a life of service.</p>
<h3>The Opportunity</h3>
<p>This coming April, with your help, I will have the opportunity to join fellow volunteers, health professionals, and anthropologists in Myanmar, a country located in Southeast Asia. For 10 days, we will work in a local village providing comprehensive health services and assisting in obtaining health, educational, and agricultural resources for the community.</p>
<h3>How can you be involved?</h3>
<p>You can do all the following: donate, share the link via Facebook, tweets, email, blogsites to allow more supportors and donors to contribute to this cause. Your dedication and involvement are not only important to me, but very important to the people, the children, and families in Myanmar.  A person can make a world of difference.</p>
<h3>Donations, where do they go?</h3>
<p>Your donations will provide basic meals, transportation, and housing for me. In addition, donations will help purchase the following items: government school tuition and weekend English classes, medicinal herbs and drugs, reading books, and agricultural supplies.  Everything will strictly go directly for this cause and only this cause.</p>

</h1>
<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>The filter features ionic absorption depth filtration technology that 
reduces up to 99% of contaminants in municipally supplied water. The Evo
 Eau filter has your back where others fall short; providing you with 
water that tastes great and gives you peace of mind. In order to bring you the 
cleanest water, our filtering process happens at a molecular level. <br/></p>

<p><br/>The filters is comprised of an activated carbon base with its true filtration power residing in its special blend of ingredients. Making the perfect filters is all about balancing blended media to achieve optimal reduction rates. In order to remove contaminants the filter must strike a balance of opposites. Every contaminant targeted has specific molecular properties that attract them. By utilizing specific media contaminants have a high affinity for we can selectively filter water for dangerous contaminants while leaving behind healthy trace minerals. <br/><br/><i><b>Dual Seal Technology</b></i></p>
<p><br/>This structural feature keeps water from getting into the drinking straw without going through the filter first. The dual seals force water to go through the filter rather than around it. Bonding the filter to the housing ensures the efficacy of the filter throughout its life. <br/><br/><i><b>Controlled Porosity</b></i></p>
<p><br/>The pore size of the filter is integral to its overall performance. The pores in this filter are absolute 5 microns. We have found this is the optimum size for municipally supplied water at is allows more volume to flow through the filter while simultaneously increasing intimacy time between contaminants and media. <br/><br/><i><b>Longevity</b></i></p>
<p><br/>The filter will clean at least 25  gallons of water. That's equal to 266 single use plastic bottles - saving you money and the environment the burden of more plastic water bottles. On average each filter will last 3 months. <br/></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p><span class=""notranlsate""></span></p>

with my bike racing team through the San Joaquin Valley of California, I
noticed something funny how water was treated there. 

</p>
<p>In the places we would stay, I noticed that the hosts
would always boil their water before using it. I was informed that the San
Joaquin Valley had become host to numerous contaminants in their public water.
I had also learned that many of the children in the valley had become stricken
with Leukemia because of the Chromium 6 (and other heavy metal) contamination
found in the water that - in reality could <i>not
</i>simply be boiled out. During that trip all I could think about was clean
water not just being a problem in third world countries, but a problem in my
own state. People were and still are being poisoned by their tap water.
When I got home, I began taking steps to find a way for people like those in
the San Joaquin Valley to drink clean water anytime, anywhere, from any tap
water source.</p>

Most water filtering bottles don't remove much from your water. The majority comply with NSF 42 standards which legally means they only have to reduce 50% of Chlorine in your water - that's it. They don't remove things like lead or mercury or filter out oil products like Benzene and PCB's. And they certainly don't address dangerous carcinogens like Chromium-6. 


We’ve created a reusable water bottle that will filter up to 99% of the contaminants listed above and hundreds of others. This is the Evo Eau bottle and it can change the world. We are committed to creating a culture where safe, pure water exists wherever people need it.That's why 5% of all our profits will go towards providing relief-grade filters in less developed and in-need areas around the world.   About the Filter

The filter features ionic absorption depth filtration technology that 
reduces up to 99% of contaminants in municipally supplied water. The Evo
 Eau filter has your back where others fall short; providing you with 
water that tastes great and gives you peace of mind. In order to bring you the 
cleanest water, our filtering process happens at a molecular level. 
Special Blend
The filters is comprised of an activated carbon base with its true filtration power residing in its special blend of ingredients. Making the perfect filters is all about balancing blended media to achieve optimal reduction rates. In order to remove contaminants the filter must strike a balance of opposites. Every contaminant targeted has specific molecular properties that attract them. By utilizing specific media contaminants have a high affinity for we can selectively filter water for dangerous contaminants while leaving behind healthy trace minerals. Dual Seal Technology
This structural feature keeps water from getting into the drinking straw without going through the filter first. The dual seals force water to go through the filter rather than around it. Bonding the filter to the housing ensures the efficacy of the filter throughout its life. Controlled Porosity
The pore size of the filter is integral to its overall performance. The pores in this filter are absolute 5 microns. We have found this is the optimum size for municipally supplied water at is allows more volume to flow through the filter while simultaneously increasing intimacy time between contaminants and media. Longevity
The filter will clean at least 25  gallons of water. That's equal to 266 single use plastic bottles - saving you money and the environment the burden of more plastic water bottles. On average each filter will last 3 months. 

Break the Bottled Water Cycle Now!

Laboratory Images
Taken with an electron microscope, these before and after images display our filter's efficacy. Filled with millions of interconnected pathways its easy to see how we can remove up to 99% of contaminants from your tap water. 


This 100X magnification shows how the filter removes dangerous things that you can’t see. The used filter shows high concentration of contaminants as well as one large organic particle. As water travels through the outer walls of the filter it encounters millions of interconnected pathways - all designed to remove up to 99% of contaminants from the water.

The surface of the filter is the first area to encounter contaminants. This image shows how contaminants smooth over the jagged edges of the filter as they build up.  Highlights in the used filter show heavy concentrations of contaminants that are permanently attached to the filter. Bacteriostatic ions keep any potential living bacteria from leaving the filter - ensuring only clean water enters the drinking straw.

This cross section image displays the complex structure of the 
filter. The used filter  image shows how contaminants smooth over the 
jagged edges of the filter as they continually build up during use. 
Contaminants go through a process called ‘chelation’ that results in a  
permanent bond between the contaminant and filter; trapping them indefinitely. 

At 400X magnification, this image captures the depth of one of the millions of interconnected pores in the Evo Eau filter. You’ll notice in this image that contaminants appear to be less vibrant than the ones on the Outer Surface images. This shows that most of the contaminants are being removed almost immediately as they enter the filter. 
Contaminants Removed: The Short List
Basic Needs Initiative
The Basic Needs Initiative is  purpose driven program formed to provide relief quality filters to those who need them most. Whether the need falls in a developing nation or here at home, we are pledging 5% of our profits our Basic Needs Initiative. These filters require no tools, are powered by gravity and surpass government purification standards. They will play a key role in preventing water borne bacteria and virus from ever being consumed. 

Why not build wells like everyone else?    
Building wells has become a very popular philanthropic trend. While we are 100% behind those that build wells we know from experience in our own backyard that wells do not guarantee clean water. By supplying these relief grade filters - people will not have to rely on wells; rather any well or fresh water source can be used with confidence. 
Filter Drops     
Inspired by Blake from Toms shoes. We too see the need to meet those who we are helping. There is no better way to empathize with those in need than to see and experience their strife first hand. Come along with us on a filter drop! We believe in culture of responsibility - experience philanthropy first hand with Evo Eau's Basic Needs Initiative filter drops. 


Filter In Your Favorite Color!



Inspiration

During college on a trip
with my bike racing team through the San Joaquin Valley of California, I
noticed something funny how water was treated there. 


In the places we would stay, I noticed that the hosts
would always boil their water before using it. I was informed that the San
Joaquin Valley had become host to numerous contaminants in their public water.
I had also learned that many of the children in the valley had become stricken
with Leukemia because of the Chromium 6 (and other heavy metal) contamination
found in the water that - in reality could not
simply be boiled out. During that trip all I could think about was clean
water not just being a problem in third world countries, but a problem in my
own state. People were and still are being poisoned by their tap water.
When I got home, I began taking steps to find a way for people like those in
the San Joaquin Valley to drink clean water anytime, anywhere, from any tap
water source.

</div></div>","New Year is right
around the corner…time to GET IN SHAPE! You join a gym, workout and after go to the closest fast food place. You wait in line for 10 minutes, eat a highly processed high fat meal and proceed to
put back on what you just worked off. It’s a vicious cycle…and after a couple
of months with few results, you give up.
Or...you go to your gym
but on the way call, text or hit your app to Fit & Fast
Foods. You place an order for a healthy, organic, tasty, high protein, low calorie meal.
You usually have your workout timed, so you know when you’ll be done & when
you walk out the door, your order is ready for pick up! Better yet, its waiting
right there in the gym parking lot. The food tastes amazing! It’s hot, it’s healthy and it’s convenient.
You achieve your weight loss goals 75% sooner and in time for spring. 


                                  Background






I've been in the fitness and health industry for 36 years. After achieving my own personal goals, I discovered helping others achieve theirs was just as rewarding. 

The fact is, when it comes time to feeling good, looking good and all out health, 75% of the equation is Nutrition. How many people do you know that workout harder that anyone yet never make significant changes. Does that sound familiar? Is it you?   (For more information) Which is more important; Nutrition Verses Exercise.






  

                           Mission

When asked why those that worked out didn't follow a nutrition program, there were three main answers:  tastes bad, too expense, and it is inconvenient. Our mission at Fit & Fast Foods is to solves all of these problems...


                            Taste


Many of the items have been put together with secret recipes of my full-blooded Italian great-great grandmother.  Others have been created, and all have been taste tested by our partner who was a Master Chef (Barry), and have simply been changed to fit specific health and fitness goals. They will mostly mimic the fast food items we have grown to love...to include multiple breakfast items, burgers and wraps, tacos, hot dogs, non-fried french fries made from both regular and sweet potatoes, salads, pizza, non-traditional items like spaghetti and meatballs (glutton free) and assorted combinations of organic vegetables made with or without sauces, or in soup. It will also include a vegetarian menu.


                          Expense



Fit & Fast Foods will be run out of food trucks/trailers and will be located in front of major gym chains. We have already been in contact with and have an agreement on our first location. Our placement will be an asset to their clientele and therefore once we've proven our worth we will be included in the marketing they've already established (radio and local TV), etc.  They have agreed to place our menus, phone applications, and all promotions in this first location. Since this is direct marketing that is inexpensive for us and no additional cost to them, these savings will be reflected in the prices. 


                        Convenience


One advantage people that already workout have is that they usually know when they will be done. Besides the walk up service, the main order process utilizes pre-orders via online, phone, app to text, or call. You tell us what you would like to eat and when you want to pick it up.  You can pre-pay for your order or pay when you pick it up. It will be ready when you arrive. There are also several pending patents on the wrapping of the foods we will  serve.  Most items will involve peal-and-eat wrappers.



                     
                    What We Need & What You Get
                     



With the teams years of experience in health and weight loss, organic natural health food companies, regular and fast food restaurants, we've put together a detailed business plan. The first step is to develop the prototype to prove production


We have the placement and cooperation of the first fitness facility and all menu items tested. The company we wish to purchase the unit, its wrap, and the inventory for the food plus accessories has been decided on:  


Sales Tax Bond, inspections, insurance, permits, rental fees, costs for running the trailer, and all the marketing tools. We won't bore you with all the details, but the total cost for the first step will be $32,000. Here is the rough breakdown:

Smart watches are even more well known and popular. Vivograph is a combination of smart watch and fitness bracelet with such a unique “cherry on the top” as a polygraph, AKA lie detector.</p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477720407/bqxkdv8mnfiec0irzazl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Enjoy your life responsibly and Vivograph will notify you in advance about any emotional or physical changes in your body on the basis of the data from the built-in sensors.</p><p>IDPP is unique software that was developed especially for the Vivograph. IDPP allows the built-in sensors to control your psychological state. IDPP makes the Vivograph adjust to your body and identifies deviations in chosen sensors readings, it registers the data on the memory card together with time and location coordinates. Then it allows you to analyze these data.</p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vivograph.com/animation/animationipdd.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><p>In the course of development of this gadget, an idea to check the psycho-physiological state of not only the person who is being tested but also the person who is conducting the test has come to us.</p><p>Unlike checking the source, checking the owner's emotional reaction to external stimuli, both passive and active, can be carried out continuously and thus monitor her/his psycho-physiological state by adding more sensors.</p><p>However, continuous readout of the sensors overloaded the processor and the battery discharged too fast. Therefore, a special program called IDPP was created. With that, the owner can track only the sensors that are most relevant.</p><p>IDPP can be set up directly through the Vivograph menu or on the smartphone with help from the mobile app.</p><p><strong> <strong>VIVOGRAPH</strong> </strong>has five basic functions which work using data from different sensors. With IDPP, you can choose sensors that will be activated to employ the function you need. You can choose how often the sensors are read, they can be read continuously or with a given periodicity. You can specify at what value of readings deviation the frequency of sensors reading will increase.

These are all direct indicators of someone's emotional state. Different emotions are matched to biometric signal patterns detected over time, which are then correlated with other types of data such as activity levels, calendar events, and location. This information is all processed by the Intellectual Data Processing Program to give you personalized and actual guidance regarding your physical and emotional state.</p><p><strong><i><strong>Q: What is IDPP?</strong></i></strong></p><p><strong><strong>A: </strong></strong>Intellectual Data Processing Program allows you to adjust your Vivograph to take in consideration your particular physical peculiarities and then inform you of any emotional or physical stresses in the most precise way. IDPP gathers data from the sensors and performs processing and comparison of the data against the adjusted settings. Thus, IDPP makes your Vivograph personalized.</p><p><strong><i><strong>Q: How and where I can adjust the IDPP?</strong></i></strong></p><p><strong><strong>A: </strong></strong>You have several options. IDPP may automatically tune itself for your body's specific characteristics. You can also choose and adjust any function from Vivograph menu and adjust as you wish. You can use the Vivograph mobile app and adjust the IDPP from your smartphone, or you can directly connect your Vivograph to a PC, or a laptop, and make the necessary adjustments with the help of Vivograph application.</p><p><strong><i><strong>Q: How long does it take to adjust my Vivograph's IDPP?</strong></i></strong></p><p><strong><strong>A: </strong></strong>Under normal circumstances, with no emotional or physical stress, adjustments will take no longer than twenty minutes. Then you will have to confirm sensors' readings. You can return to the manufacturers' settings at any time and repeat the sensors adjustments for IDPP.</p><p><strong><i><strong>Q: How often the sensors readings are taken?</strong></i></strong></p><p><strong><strong>A: </strong></strong>The smaller the deviation of actual reading from the average-set value, the less the readings frequency will be. Reading's frequency is determined by the IDPP, according to an actuated function. You can also set the frequency manually or decide over specific sensors readings you want to track.</p><p><strong><i><strong>Q: Can I track readings of a certain sensor?</strong></i></strong></p><p><strong><strong>A: </strong></strong>Yes, with help from IDPP you can select one or several certain sensors and their readings will be taken at a frequency set by you.</p><p><strong><strong><i>Q: Can I use the Vivograph only as a Smart Watch?</i></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>A: </strong></strong>Of course, you can.

Smart watches are even more well known and popular. Vivograph is a combination of smart watch and fitness bracelet with such a unique “cherry on the top” as a polygraph, AKA lie detector. Enjoy your life responsibly and Vivograph will notify you in advance about any emotional or physical changes in your body on the basis of the data from the built-in sensors.IDPP is unique software that was developed especially for the Vivograph. IDPP allows the built-in sensors to control your psychological state. IDPP makes the Vivograph adjust to your body and identifies deviations in chosen sensors readings, it registers the data on the memory card together with time and location coordinates. Then it allows you to analyze these data.In the course of development of this gadget, an idea to check the psycho-physiological state of not only the person who is being tested but also the person who is conducting the test has come to us.Unlike checking the source, checking the owner's emotional reaction to external stimuli, both passive and active, can be carried out continuously and thus monitor her/his psycho-physiological state by adding more sensors.However, continuous readout of the sensors overloaded the processor and the battery discharged too fast. Therefore, a special program called IDPP was created. With that, the owner can track only the sensors that are most relevant.IDPP can be set up directly through the Vivograph menu or on the smartphone with help from the mobile app. VIVOGRAPH has five basic functions which work using data from different sensors. With IDPP, you can choose sensors that will be activated to employ the function you need. You can choose how often the sensors are read, they can be read continuously or with a given periodicity. You can specify at what value of readings deviation the frequency of sensors reading will increase. You can set up the maximum deviations of the sensors readings at which VIVOGRAPH will give you a warning. Most important, the IDDP allows you creating new unique functions taking into account your body’s unique features. You can choose certain sensors and readings which you want to track during a given interval or in relation to physical or psychological load. While you’re watching a movie, reading a book, listening to a lecture, just pick the sensors which determine your emotional state so you can see the subconscious response of your body to the information you get.When doing physical activity, you can track the basic indications of your body in real time via certain sensors: heart beat rate and its changes in time, changes in blood pressure, how much oxygen is in your blood and the temperature of the body etc.   SENSORS & COMPONENTS VIVOGRAPH APP  You can use the VIVOGRAPH just like a smartphone  Recharging VIVOGRAPH is easy and simple    ​Besides, we offer an optional VIVOGRAPH KIT which you can use to check the honesty of a person you’re talking with  Main features of the VIVOGRAPH Modeling the VIVOGRAPH prototype   COMPARE WEARABLES We offer Three Sizes to choose from​

To get on board, applicants design a project to advance across the communities where our train stops and then race to be among the first 15 applicants on their selected train journey to reach their $5,000 crowdfunding goal. To learn more about the 2016 journeys click here. The applicant's project is described below.

 

Through a 10-day cross-country trip, our project will unify multiple stakeholders in the water sector to determine the economic, political, and technical requirements needed to commercialize this technology in developed and underdeveloped communities across the world. 
We are making this:



It's a plant-based water filter that removes over 99.99% of harmful microbes, lead, the taste of chlorine, and other things you don't want to drink.


WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO US: 
783 million people drink water that looks like this: 

 
Contaminated water is responsible for 3.4 million deaths, mostly children, each year and it claims more lives than malaria, AIDS, and measles combined: more than 15,000 per day. 
No one should die from drinking dirty water. 
Our most recent test showed this:


Our filter uses a plant that grows in almost all the places that lack clean water, meaning this will be BIG.

   The Impact Our 10-day campaign is designed to accomplish the following: 





Identify the perceived
risks, needs, unexpected benefits, and incentives of each
stakeholder—politicians, investors, private utilities, customers,
environmentalists, researchers, etc.—associated with the commercialization of
plant-based water treatment technology in the developed and underdeveloped
world


Spread the awareness of
plant-based water treatment technology and its advantages of use in the developed
and underdeveloped world for water treatment to approximately 10,000+
individuals


Spread the awareness of
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the desire to provide the
rest of the world access to clean water


Speak to at least 2,500
Millennials, or 500 per University visited at each MTP stop, whom are enrolled
at a University, about the global water crisis and plant-based water treatment
technology with the goal of encouraging more students to pursue social
entrepreneurship

Connect to potential Venture
Capital firms interested in water treatment technology interested in investing
in our company, Everwaters.
Identify the business
models of large scale water treatment facilities to determine the operational
costs of switching to a plant-based water treatment technique
Design a business model
for a municipal water treatment facility using plant-based chemicals
Identify the legislative and
technical requirements of using plant-based chemicals by meeting with Water
Councils and local politicians

 Unite stakeholders under
the mission of pursuing sustainable water treatment practices in the developed
and underdeveloped world

Determine a plan to fund
and operate the first-ever plant-based municipal water treatment facility in
underdeveloped communities
Identify the public health
risks of using aluminum sulfate, lime, and chlorine in industrial water
treatment practices


Below is the short itinerary as to what Adrian will be doing at each stop of the MTP journey. Some of the plans are bold, but that's the whole point of the journey!


In Los Angeles, Adrian will survey locals about current water treatment practices and spread awareness of using plants to clean water. Adrian will speak at UCLA and at the California State University about the water crisis, in both developed and underdeveloped communities, and the potential of using plants to solve these problems; he will also request to meet with Arnold Schwarzenegger, if possible, to spread awareness of our sustainable water treatment technology.



In San Francisco, Adrian will request to meet with Public Health Professionals and Water Researchers at Stanford and Berkeley to discuss the health concerns of current water treatment practices and outline the technical requirements associated with plant-based water treatment technology. Adrian will also schedule meetings with local investors to pitch the project idea. If possible, he will reach out to Elon Musk, with the goal championing sustainable technology for the future.  



In Denver, Adrian will visit the Colorado River Basin to work with local politicians and researchers to understand the risks associated with the use of chemicals and contamination of the aquifer and the policies associated with its usage; he will present at the University of Denver.



In Milwaukee Adrian will visit: Veolia, The Water Council, Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, BREW Water Business Accelerator, and present about plant-based water treatment and the need for sustainable practices for the future; he will present at the University of Wisconsin.



In Detroit, Adrian will visit the Detroit River and Lake Huron to learn about the Institute of Water Research.; he would like to assemble a conference, inviting local water nonprofits, politicians, investors, and give a culminating speech on the potential for plant-based water treatment technology for both the developed and underdeveloped world. He will then present at the University of Detroit Mercy.

Let me echo what a wise man once said, “If you do not put all of your effort to create innovation, it is not a real innovation.” Even if you have as much as 20 years experience in product design and manufacturing like I do. Six years ago, my child got a toothache. The dentist advised us to use a better toothbrush, so I searched the electric toothbrush market. After trying a few high-end products, I still felt none of them were good enough for my child. It took 5 years of dental research, user studies, and product designing until I finally invented a more effective oscillating-rotating technology for our sonic toothbrush. Our users loved it! Soon after, my wife asked, “This is an amazing product you’ve created for our child with so much love! Now, how about you create something that innovative for me?” Suddenly, it hit me; I could add two more options for women’s facial care that will make my wife and many women out there extremely happy! I immediately started up our own business with a dedicated team of professionals under the name,3Deep Inc. in Saratoga, CA and our website (3deepcare.com) was booming! I also strongly believe in the words of Steve Jobs when he said, “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” The 3D-SONIC TOOTHBRUSH uses sonic, circular vibrations to thoroughly clean and buff your teeth. It’s far more effective at removing plaque by forcing toothpaste between your teeth than any other toothbrush on the market. In a world where the majority of cavities are caused by poor brushing, you need this kind of precision in a toothbrush! And as a bonus, the two additional heads for the 3D-Sonic are great for facial cleansing and massage. This multifaceted tool is the perfect gift for the whole family. And there is no need for batteries! You can recharge it over and over. Now, of course, 3D-Sonic can’t happen without your support. We need you to back our campaign today so we can produce the first run of this amazing product and spread the gift of beautiful smiles all over the world! So take control of your oral and facial health and pre-order your 3D-Sonic Toothbrush today!  </div><div> </div><div><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/73fbd986"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487409531/x5wlvsw0tfkmigkdgx2r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></div><div> </div><div> </div><div>

<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p>Frequently Asked Questions</p>
<p> 1. How does 3Deep's 3D-SONIC Toothbrush differ from other Sonic Toothbrushes?</p>
<p>3Deep's 3D-SONIC Toothbrush cleans teeth fully in a three-dimensional way, while other Sonic Toothbrushes clean teeth as if they're a flat surface, and are especially weak in cleaning between teeth.</p>
<p>2.  What are 3Deep's 3D-SONIC Toothbrush capabilities?</p>
<p>Firstly, 3Deep 3-in-1 multifunction can clean not only teeth but also faces, and can even massage faces---in fact, its oscillating-rotating 3D-Sonic technology is highly effective in facial care. Secondly, 3Deep is far more effective at removing plaque than other products being sold. It’s a worthwhile investment because it not only helps reduce gum recession but also performs better at blasting away debris between gaps, thereby removing stains and polishing ""pearly whites"" for a healthier, happier mouth. Sonic toothbrushes use intense vibration to literally buff teeth while forcing toothpaste between teeth, which results in an impressively-polished feel.</p>
<p>3.  What are 3Deep's cleansing brush's and massaging head's capabilities?</p>
<p>Firstly, you can pamper yourself with an at-home spa treatment using 3Deep's added cleansing brush attachment that leaves your skin feeling clean, clear, fresh, and healthy. Secondly, you may finish your beauty routine with 3Deep's soft massaging head attachment, which may help relieve soreness and discomfort and may also help apply your favorite cream to better penetrate your skin to keep it both nourished and hydrated.</p>
<p>4. What are the main advantages of 3Deep's 3D-SONIC Toothbrush？</p>
<p>3Deep's 3D-SONIC Toothbrush represents a new generation of teeth-cleaning in three-dimensional way, which has cleansing advantages both in oscillating-rotating and sonic techniques.</p>
<p>5. How long can my teeth be whitened by using 3Deep?</p>

<p>6. Does 3Deep's metal handle safely avoid causing electric shocks?</p>
<p>3Deep's highest voltage is 4.2 volts, which is absolutely safe.</p>
<p>7. How many modes are available for 3Deep? How do I use it?</p>
<p>3Deep has two modes. When you are first press its button to turn it on, its gentle mode will continue for two minutes, after which you can activate its powerful mode by pressing its button twice more.</p>
<p>8. Does 3Deep include any automated functions?</p>
<p>Yes, 3Deep will automatically turn itself off after 2 minutes of disuse. It also automatically prompts users every 30 seconds to consider scrubbing another part of their teeth or face.</p>
<p>9. How many times can 3Deep be used on a single charge?</p>
<p>After being fully charged, 3Deep can be used 40 times (for 2 minutes each time) before needing to be recharged.</p>
<p>10. How can I know 3Deep is fully charged?</p>
<p>When 3Deep's green light stops flashing, it is fully charged.</p>
<p>11. How often should 3Deep's heads be changed?</p>

<p>14. Is 3Deep waterproof？</p>
<p>3Deep is designed to be water-resistant enough (with an IPX6 rating) that it may be washed.</p>
<p>15. How durable is 3Deep?</p>
<p>3Deep can normally be used for at least 2 years.</p>
<p>16. Will 3Deep's metal handles’ colors fade?</p>
<p>3Deep's handles will never fade.</p>
<p>17. Is 3Deep's charger usable worldwide?</p>
<p>Yes, 3Deep may be charged with voltage from 100V to 240V and with AC frequency from 50Hz to 60Hz, which renders it compatible with nearly all electrical systems worldwide. It uses two kinds of chargers, which are both the American Standard Charger (ASC) and the EU Standard Charger (ESC).</p>
<p>18. Will 3Deep become available in additional colors?</p>
<p>Perhaps; 3Deep Inc. would like to offer both grey and black, as well.</p>
<p>19. I am with the Early bird. How can I add more toothbrush head?</p>
<p>Add $11 to your current pledge, to show you want a pack of 4 additional toothbrush heads. Then at the end of the project, when we do our survey, we will get the details.</p>
<p>20. where can I buy extra heads in the future? If I want to order more heads here now, how can I make a pledge?</p>
<p>3Deep will start global marketing network for sales on Ebay and Amazon after the campaign is completed. So you can buy all kinds of heads you need over there. <br/>If you want to order more heads here now, just Add $11 to your current pledge, to show you want a pack of 4 additional toothbrush heads.

Simply plug and charge your 3Deep Sonic Toothbrush for countless uses that will leave you smiling every time! Functional PrototypeA prototype that demonstrates the functionality of the final product but has a different appearance. Love our product? Share it with your friends! :)        Hello, my name is Jack Cui, inventor of the 3Deep toothbrush. Let me echo what a wise man once said, “If you do not put all of your effort to create innovation, it is not a real innovation.” Even if you have as much as 20 years experience in product design and manufacturing like I do. Six years ago, my child got a toothache. The dentist advised us to use a better toothbrush, so I searched the electric toothbrush market. After trying a few high-end products, I still felt none of them were good enough for my child. It took 5 years of dental research, user studies, and product designing until I finally invented a more effective oscillating-rotating technology for our sonic toothbrush. Our users loved it! Soon after, my wife asked, “This is an amazing product you’ve created for our child with so much love! Now, how about you create something that innovative for me?” Suddenly, it hit me; I could add two more options for women’s facial care that will make my wife and many women out there extremely happy! I immediately started up our own business with a dedicated team of professionals under the name,3Deep Inc. in Saratoga, CA and our website (3deepcare.com) was booming! I also strongly believe in the words of Steve Jobs when he said, “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” The 3D-SONIC TOOTHBRUSH uses sonic, circular vibrations to thoroughly clean and buff your teeth. It’s far more effective at removing plaque by forcing toothpaste between your teeth than any other toothbrush on the market. In a world where the majority of cavities are caused by poor brushing, you need this kind of precision in a toothbrush! And as a bonus, the two additional heads for the 3D-Sonic are great for facial cleansing and massage. This multifaceted tool is the perfect gift for the whole family. And there is no need for batteries! You can recharge it over and over. Now, of course, 3D-Sonic can’t happen without your support. We need you to back our campaign today so we can produce the first run of this amazing product and spread the gift of beautiful smiles all over the world! So take control of your oral and facial health and pre-order your 3D-Sonic Toothbrush today!     
Risks and challenges
We have been preparing for the past year to minimize any possible risks. We have some product in stock and our manufacturing plant is poised to run smoothly. Our delivery times are expected to meet all set deadlines.

FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions
 1. How does 3Deep's 3D-SONIC Toothbrush differ from other Sonic Toothbrushes?
3Deep's 3D-SONIC Toothbrush cleans teeth fully in a three-dimensional way, while other Sonic Toothbrushes clean teeth as if they're a flat surface, and are especially weak in cleaning between teeth.
2.  What are 3Deep's 3D-SONIC Toothbrush capabilities?
Firstly, 3Deep 3-in-1 multifunction can clean not only teeth but also faces, and can even massage faces---in fact, its oscillating-rotating 3D-Sonic technology is highly effective in facial care. Secondly, 3Deep is far more effective at removing plaque than other products being sold. It’s a worthwhile investment because it not only helps reduce gum recession but also performs better at blasting away debris between gaps, thereby removing stains and polishing ""pearly whites"" for a healthier, happier mouth. Sonic toothbrushes use intense vibration to literally buff teeth while forcing toothpaste between teeth, which results in an impressively-polished feel.
3.  What are 3Deep's cleansing brush's and massaging head's capabilities?
Firstly, you can pamper yourself with an at-home spa treatment using 3Deep's added cleansing brush attachment that leaves your skin feeling clean, clear, fresh, and healthy. Secondly, you may finish your beauty routine with 3Deep's soft massaging head attachment, which may help relieve soreness and discomfort and may also help apply your favorite cream to better penetrate your skin to keep it both nourished and hydrated.
4. What are the main advantages of 3Deep's 3D-SONIC Toothbrush？
3Deep's 3D-SONIC Toothbrush represents a new generation of teeth-cleaning in three-dimensional way, which has cleansing advantages both in oscillating-rotating and sonic techniques.

<h3><strong><em>This campaign is being started to raise money for the Colon Cancer foundation we started in Spartanburg, SC (A Miracle For Mom Foundation <a href=""http://www.sos.sc.gov/index.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sos.sc.gov/index.asp</a>) .  The focus of our foundation is to raise money for my mother who has stage 4 colon cancer and others faced with battling colon cancer without adequate health insurance.  This serious condition plagues hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. My goal is to raise money for my mom's chemotherapy treatments which cost close to $125k yearly and continue to raise money to fund our foundation which will assist others with their medical expenses associated with this deadly disease.  We are Americans; and no honest, hard working, tax paying American should not have to die because they have little-to-no medical coverage. Who better to tell my mother's story than my mother herself, Dr. Betty Staggs.  Please read..Story below....</em></strong></h3>
<p>I was born on Groundhog Day some fifty or so years ago.  Daughter to two teenage parents not equipped to raise a new baby.  Lewis (Pop) and Aline Rice raised me from the time I came home from the hospital.  From that time own they were my parents and treated me as such.  I received very limited visits from my birth mother, however; she would send me boxes of clothes to ease her guilty conscience and try to soothe the emptiness I felt about being abandoned.  My birth fathers identity was an open secret to everyone.  He never claimed me publicly but his family, (brothers, sisters, etc.), embraced me with open arms.</p>
<p>I was a gifted child. (Yes I am bragging on myself here!) A Majorette in the marching band, head cheerleader for basketball, I could (and can) draw anything just by looking at it.   I was in a sense a classic overachiever. </p>
<p>Being given away gave my self esteem a blow, no matter how many accomplishments I made in school, I still could not shake feelings of inadequacy that haunt me to this day.  It is, I am told the burden that many children given away face.  Why was I not good enough to keep? What made my own father deny me? At the age of 16 I tried to take my life because I felt myself a burden on everyone.  I took 100 aspirin.  God is good!  It was not my time.  Over the years I have had many near death experiences.  I believe nothing happens by accident.  My life is my testimony.  As you read on, you will see I am a survivor.  I made it. </p>
<p>I entered an ill fated marriage at the age of 18 that gave me the greatest gifts in my life, my three children.</p>
<p>An artist at heart, I moved to Connecticut to finish school.  I moved in with my birth mother and her husband.   I worked and taught art.  My husband at the time had no job so I was the provider of our family.</p>
<p>I moved back to SC after a time to pursue my love of cutting hair.  My dad taught me everything about clippers.  I loved (and still do) making people look good! ""A New You""! I used to go to the ladies home and do hair at no charge.  I would also go to the homebound and do their hair.  The nursing home had many patients whose families forgot about them, not me!  I loved to go there and do both men and women hair.  It gave me comfort to help and the people were so grateful it gave my heart a lift to do the little I could to help out.</p>
<p>I finished Cosmetology School and received both licenses, barber and cosmetology.  Shortly thereafter I joined the State Association of Cosmetologists, SCSCA.  From there, I became involved in and a member of the NBCL, Inc. The NBCL was fundamental in allowing me to obtain all of my advanced degrees.  I worked hard for and received my BA, MA, and a Doctorate from Chicago State University.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile my business was booming.  At one time I had upwards to 30 + clients per day.  I would get out of my shop at 10:30 to 11 at night.  Half of my clients could not pay me.  Maybe they were ill or they were laid off or their husband was.  I did not allow that to stop me from blessing them.  Sometimes a nice hair cut or ""do"" is all a person has to make them feel good.  I trained over 65 barbers at no cost and most opened up their own shops.  I have traveled all over the US and Bahamas teaching styling techniques and hair cutting techniques to various   I am still training people.  I love to see people do well, and having your own business is the American dream.  </p>
<p>I was approached to do a campaign/contest in Upstate South Carolina to encourage people to get screened for Colon Cancer.  From that campaign I received over 100 promise cards from people to get colonoscopy screenings.  I was not able to have one at that time because being self employed; I did not have health insurance. </p>
<p>About a year later I started having stomach pains.  I thought I was gassy or maybe had indigestion.  I went in to the doctor and was then referred to an Oncology surgeon to have a possible cyst removed from my ovary.  Unknown to me cancer was suspected all along.  I underwent surgery on, January 5, 2011.  The diagnosis was shocking.  Cancer had started in my appendix and the organ exploded!  The surgeon took out the affected organ and some surrounding organs for good measure.  He also took out lymph nodes for testing.  Upon getting the results for those tests I learned that I had stage 3C colon cancer. Devastated is not the word for how I felt when I heard that news.  I felt my life was on hold.  The strength from my children was all I had to hold on to.  I was not informing anyone of my status.  I did not want pity or bad wishes.  I only wanted to deal with this privately, and live.  Chemo was something I could not avoid but the doctor did give me hope, a 60/40 chance that the cancer would not come back. </p>
<p>I went on to live and thrive thinking that the worst of that ordeal was behind me.  I have given speeches about the effects of Colon Cancer on individuals with no insurance to the SC legislature. I even attained a license to become a licensed clown so I can continue to put smiles on peoples faces.  My stage  name is ""Blinky the Clown"".  My favorite quote; ""Smiles are contagious"".</p>
<p>Meanwhile my father, Lewis""Pop"" Rice became homebound.  I now became responsible for his care as well.  The situation with him became such that he needed full-time care.  The caregivers hired took more than his check could cover so long story short, I had to move in.  He took me in an orphan when I was unwanted, loved me and asked for nothing in return.  This was the least I could do for him.  It is ironic, he pinned diapers on me, now it was my turn to return the favor.  He always said, ""always treat people well, you never know who is going to bring you your last cup of water"".  Sadly, after being blessed and blessing others for 97 years, my dad passed away November 8, 2012.</p>
<p>As a part of my treatment I entered a case study for people with colon cancer.  As a part of this study I was given medication every week and CT screenings every three months.  Three weeks ago, I found out that my cancer came back.  It grew from invisible to very large in a three month time span.  The prognosis is very grim.  The doctor gave me a life expectancy of 1.5 to 2 years.  I looked him in his eyes and asked about other options such as Cancer Centers of America.  He said, sure those are options but you have no insurance!  Imagine being told that in front of your children.  You have no hope because even though you have worked all your life, helped people all your life, you have no insurance so you can take this treatment or die.  That might not be what he said but that was certainly what I heard.  Not telling my children, I made up in my mind that I would not take the chemo that was the next course of treatment.  I was sure that it will take me out of this world.  They fought back.  ""You are taking this treatment""!  I relented and agreed to begin the second course of chemo. </p>
<p>Speaking to the Colon Cancer advocate gave me hope.  There is no expiration date on me.  I can live! There are people out there right now living with this disease that beat it and better!  I am going to be one of those people.  This is my testimony.  Just when I begin to get down about my circumstances, I realize that there is hope.  My children, friends, and family are helping out with different ideas of raising money so that I can afford to get a second opinion at another hospital and maybe alternative treatment.  This will not be an easy task but it is a very attainable one.  I am sharing this with all of the people who read this to say: I am one of you.  I could even be you.  I was told I am going to die.  I say NO!  I am going to live.  I have much more to do in this life.  I have more to give to others, more to teach, more to do.  I am not finished.  With everyone’s help my life and this fight will not be in vain. Your participation in this fundraiser will help me reach my goal. </p>
<p>Millions of people live right now with no health insurance.  They make too much to qualify for state medical insurance and private insurance is priced out of their range.  Something has to change.</p>
<p>I now ask you to challenge yourself. Even if you can not afford to give to my fund, please forward my campaign and website to others in your circle. We are thriving to make national headlines with my story to make an impact in the fight against colon cancer and the uninsured.  Thanks for reading my story and I truly appreciate your support.</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Betsy and Harold Cunningham are just the greatest people.  Everything for them is about their family and their community--Harold fought for our country in Vietnam, they rescue abandoned and abused animals, they've volunteered in their church community--they have given and given and given to all of us who know them.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Betsy's totally devoted to her family.  The only reason she went back to work was to pay for their health insurance, and even then she made sure she left for work after the kids got off to school, and she got home just in time to meet the bus.  Just this past January, the money coming in couldn't offset the premium anymore--they had to let the coverage lapse.</p>

This is Betsy Cunningham and her grandbaby, J.W.
Betsy and Harold Cunningham are just the greatest people.  Everything for them is about their family and their community--Harold fought for our country in Vietnam, they rescue abandoned and abused animals, they've volunteered in their church community--they have given and given and given to all of us who know them.
Betsy's totally devoted to her family.  The only reason she went back to work was to pay for their health insurance, and even then she made sure she left for work after the kids got off to school, and she got home just in time to meet the bus.  Just this past January, the money coming in couldn't offset the premium anymore--they had to let the coverage lapse.

What happened to them?

The bills, though...they are coming in fast.  Harold is doing everything he can to balance what's coming in with what has to go out to pay for Betsy's neurologist and time in the hospital, but he and Betsy need help.

<p><strong>Lanney’s Story</strong></p>
<p>Born on November 23<sup>rd</sup>, 1999, Lanney Phillips was barely out of her mother’s womb when she was diagnosed with Bilateral Retino Blastoma at just 6 months of age. Retino Blastoma is a rapidly developing cancer that develops in the eye’s retina (the light-detecting tissue). Lanney spent the next four months undergoing chemo treatments to fight the cancer, but doctors determined that her left eye needed to be surgically removed because the retina had detached as a result of the cancerous tumor.</p>
<p>After the surgery, Lanney went through laser treatment every month until she was two and a half, at which point she was sent to Philadelphia for radiation treatment.</p>
<p>At 3 years old, and after having completed 25 radiation treatments, she was pronounced cancer free!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite having beaten the cancer, her remaining eye required cataract surgery and a lens implant.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 years and Lanney, now 13, is a 7<sup>th</sup> grader who, like many of her peers, needed braces. Unlike her peers, however, the radiation treatments she underwent as a child had deteriorated her jaw bones to the point that standard orthodontia treatment would be impossible.</p>
<p>No one realized that Lanney had spent her entire life eating on only the left side of her mouth. If doctors don’t act now, she will likely continue to lose bone mass in her jaws as she gets older.</p>
<p>In order to prevent this from happening, Lanney will need 3 implants, screws to hold her bottom jaw in place, bone graphs and further testing of the deteriorating bone. Doctors will also begin her on hyperbaric oxygen therapy to try to regenerate some of the healthy cells that the radiation treatment destroyed in the process of killing off the cancerous cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can you help?</strong></p>
<p>Despite having medical insurance, her parents Tommy and Lindsay Phillips must come up with $20,000 up front before the doctors or insurance will do anything to help Lanney. This is what led us to start this campaign. Lanney is a trooper to have gone through so much at such a young age, and we are humbly asking for your support.</p>
<p>We want to thank you in advance for any and all support you can contribute to Lanney.</p>

Due to our largest funder, the Soros Moldova Foundation, closing its palliative care program in Moldova, we have been diligently searching for other funding opportunities. While the organization is scheduled to receive more funding in March 2015, it is currently without funding. 
To give you some context, cancer is the second leading cause of death in Moldova, and many people do not get early detection screenings. Thus, they are often diagnosed with cancer when it is too late to reverse the disease’s damage, and people often suffer in a great deal of pain without proper care and medications. In order to solve this dire issue, Angelus Taraclia began operations in 2009 with the introduction of a free home palliative care program. 
Angelus Taraclia is scheduled to sign a new contract with the National Health Insurance Company (CNAM) in March 2015, but until then, the organization is without funding.

Our goal of $2,000 will cover a month and a half of Angelus Taraclia's expenses.   What We Need & Your Impact
Notably, in January 2014, the WHO adopted a resolution stating that governments should integrate palliative care into health systems and provide palliative care as a human right for those with terminal illnesses. Unfortunately, in the Republic of Moldova, there is little support from the government or CNAM to finance Angelus Taraclia’s expenses, including staff salaries, gasoline for home visits, and the free medical services and care that Angelus Taraclia provides to its patients and their families. 
Your contribution will keep the hospice running and give patients the ability to die with dignity, peacefully and surrounded by loved ones in the least amount of pain possible. Unfortunately, since Angelus Taraclia is not a registered 501(c)(3) in the United States, donations will not be tax deductible. That being said, whether we do not reach our fundraising goal or whether we surpass it, all of the money raised will go to benefit Angelus Taraclia and its beneficiaries. 

    Other Ways You Can Help Although we do not know the exact amount of support we will receive from CNAM or other long-term donors in 2015, your contributions will bridge gap funding for Angelus Taraclia's ongoing expenses. Every donation helps us over the next few months while we continue to search for other sources of support.

<p></p>
<p></p><p>My name is Maria Barnes.  I am energetic, fun-loving, positive, full of life and passionate about living a healthy lifestyle.  I live this passion as a naturopath doctor and fitness trainer and love helping others realize their full health potential.  I also happen to be fighting breast cancer.</p><p>Many people have been touched by the misfortune of cancer, either directly or indirectly.  The disease brings the obvious health issues, but also causes stressful situations that are not so apparent.  Cancer patients undergoing treatment are often unable to work and even with insurance, face overwhelming medical bills.  The stress associated with an inability to cover mounting expenses can have a negative impact on one's ability to heal. I have faced these challenges personally and want to offer a helping hand to others.</p>
<p>My desire to raise money is
primarily for two reasons. The first is to help with my living expenses. Secondly, it’s to
provide a small token of financial support to others fighting cancer and
in need of assistance.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What

My name is Maria Barnes.  I am energetic, fun-loving, positive, full of life and passionate about living a healthy lifestyle.  I live this passion as a naturopath doctor and fitness trainer and love helping others realize their full health potential.  I also happen to be fighting breast cancer.Many people have been touched by the misfortune of cancer, either directly or indirectly.  The disease brings the obvious health issues, but also causes stressful situations that are not so apparent.  Cancer patients undergoing treatment are often unable to work and even with insurance, face overwhelming medical bills.  The stress associated with an inability to cover mounting expenses can have a negative impact on one's ability to heal. I have faced these challenges personally and want to offer a helping hand to others.
My desire to raise money is
primarily for two reasons. The first is to help with my living expenses. Secondly, it’s to
provide a small token of financial support to others fighting cancer and
in need of assistance.

He has epilepsy as well as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition, Mark suffers from repeated traumatic brain injuries sustained in (1) a car accident while he served in the armed forces, (2) a jailhouse assault when Bowles resisted rape by another inmate, and (3) a fall while dizzy and weak, possibly because he was overly medicated in Anoka County Jail. Mark's injuries are so severe that his brain is now in irreversible atrophy, which is expected to be fatal.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">2.  During the week ending June 28, 2014, Mark Bowles was wrongly convicted of the ""crime"" of having brain injuries. Mark experienced epileptic seizures that frightened a hospital employee after he emerged from a coma caused by an assault against him in Anoka County Jail. The woman was attempted to move away from Mark during his epileptic episode; she fell and bumped her own head. Unfortunately, Mark was falsely accused of assaulting the timid woman, who obviously should not be working with people who have epilepsy or traumatic brain injuries. Mark was allowed to present NO defense whatsoever during his trial. Mark's only possible defense was his diminished capacity caused by (1) traumatic brain injury and (2) his overdose on time-released psychotropic medications by the jail and/or the hospital. The jury was NOT allowed to hear either defense.</span></p>
</div><p>3.  Naturally, Mark's case must be appealed. That is why your help is needed to save Mark from wrongful incarceration. His sentencing date will be in August 2014.

See both men pictured below (Lewis, the accused assailant is on the left, and Mark is in a coma on the right). All GLBTQ people who love justice are as appalled by this senseless assault and Mark's catastrophic injuries as you must be. He was a college student who enjoyed the outdoors before his attack. Now he suffers excruciating headaches and has to use a wheel chair and colostomy bag. His eyes are very sensitive to light, and he must wear shades indoors.

<b>5.  It may seem incredible, </b>but some of our fellow citizens, even veterans like Mark, were actually railroaded into prisons and jails throughout America. Two Pennsylvania judges were convicted and sentenced for channeling hundreds of innocent children into their co-conspirators' juvenile detention facilities in exchange for $2.6 million. At least one child committed suicide. Former Judge Ken Anderson of Texas was disbarred and arrested when it was revealed that he deliberately withheld evidence of Michael Morton's innocence. As a prosecutor, Anderson caused Morton, an innocent, grieving widow and father, to be wrongly convicted and sentenced to prison. Morton suffered there for 25 years while Anderson's career accelerated. Anderson became a judge partly because of Morton's wrongful conviction. Not only was Morton cheated of the opportunity to raise his young, motherless son, but taxpayers were cheated of over $800,000 they paid to conduct Morton's criminal trial and incarcerate the innocent, young widow who remained imprisoned until he was middle age. There are many more examples of unjust jury verdicts that occurred because information was deliberately withheld that would have led to acquittals for innocent defendants like Mark Bowles. <p></p>
<p><b>6.  After a trial during which U.S. veteran Mark Bowles was allowed to give no defense whatsoever and was therefore wrongfully convicted, he attempted suicide. </b>Diana Sprouse sent an urgent message: ""He slit his throat! Please pray!"" Mark was convicted by a jury that was denied hearing any defense he could have given for allegedly assaulting a nurse in his hospital room. Defenses related to Mark's diminished capacity were reportedly squashed by Judge Frank Kundrat. The jury sent questions to the court, including: <b>(1) Was Mark Bowles mentally ill? <br/>(2) Was Mark Bowles on medication that may have contributed to his offense? </b><br/></p>
<p>7.  The correct answer to each question was yes, but Judge Kundrat refused answers for the jury's questions. He cautioned the jury about considering anything that was not presented at trial, which was zero defense for the defendant. Mark is presently hospitalized under an armed guard like an animal following his unsuccessful suicide attempt. He was wrongly convicted of attacking medical personnel when the truth is he had an epileptic seizure that frightened a nurse who fell and bumped her own head. </p>
<p>8.  Mark fears dying in prison from (a) his present brain injuries, (b) another overdose of prescription medications distributed by uninterested, unskilled prison personnel, or (c) while fighting off more jailhouse rapists. Mark said he would rather die now than suffer torture and brutality possibly for years and then die anyway of his brain atrophy. It is incredible that a U.S. veteran with traumatic head injuries and just out of a coma, would be so harshly punished for having epileptic seizures -- unless one realizes that such injustices happen often since many American prisons and jails were privatized and must be kept at a certain occupancy level.</p>
<p><b>9.  America presently has more than 1.25 million mentally ill inmates</b> who comprise over 60 percent of the nation's prisoners in solitary confinement -- a cruel practice that the United Nations has labeled as torture. The wrongful conviction of Mark Bowles, a U.S. veteran and PTSD and epileptic patient, helps explain how that happened. The nurse who fell and bumped her head should hold the hospital responsible for sending her into a situation she was untrained to handle. She fully recovered, but unless you help Mark Bowles have a competent appellate lawyer, he and his mother may never recover from the horrors that they suffer in the Minnesota justice system.

Why Goat Milk is best?</h1><p>Consumers of goat milk frequently report beneficial health 
outcomes after switching from cow's milk to goat milk.  Some benefits 
include:  improved digestion and gut health, reduced mucus production, 
and resolution of chronic skin problems.</p><p>Goat Milk is the most 
commonly consumed milk in the world and most like human breast milk. It 
has a much lower allergenic potential compared to cow milk.  Unlike cow 
milk, the protein structure of human milk and goat milk are very 
similar.  It is naturally homogenized, contains smaller fat particles, 
less lactose,and 89% less Alpha-s1 casein than cow milk. Alpha-s1 Casein
 is a common allergen in cow milk.  Lastly, Goat milk contains Medium 
Chain Triglycerides (MCT's) and Prebiotics.  For these reasons, goat 
milk is less allergenic than cow milk and tolerated by most people.</p><h1>Pasture-Raised Goats</h1><p>The
 Goat Milk products are from healthy, grass fed, free-range goats that 
graze on pesticide free and chemical free pasture 365 days of the year. 
 They are offered hydroponically sprouted barley only during milking

had spread to my liver.Later that month (after I had a port put in) I 
started on chemo,I had every bad side effect that comes with it.In 
Sept.my family drove from Colorado to Austin Texas and convinced my wife
 and I to move so that they could help care for me.So we moved to a 
small town in Colorado (where I grew up). My new doctors wanted to go 
with surgery so I got off chemo and in Jan 2012 I went into surgery.They
 removed 9 inches of colon and half of my liver.While I was recovering 
in ICU my colon burst and I went into septic shock (they thought they 
lost me twice). I went back into surgery where they had to put me on a 
colostomy bag.I spent 4 weeks in the hospital.I had to go back numerous 
times with complications.In May 2012 I had another scan and it showed a 
spot on my liver and one on my colon.So back on chemo for the liver with
 radiation for the colon.In Sept. I was back in the ER with stomach 
pains,they had to take out 12 inches of lower bowel (the radiation had 
fried it along with part of my bladder). He tried to reverse my 
colostomy while he had me opened up but couldn't because the scar tissue
 was too hard,he also noticed that the spot on my colon was scar tissue 
(26 days of radiation for nothing). In Jan.this year I was back on chemo
 for 6 treatments,in May another scan showed the spot on my liver had 
grown.So chemo wasn't working radiation or surgery wasn't an option and I
 was given about 1 year to live (AGAIN). My doctor sent all my info to a
 doctor in Denver for a procedure called SIR-Sphere's but he didn't 
think I was a candidate for it.A couple weeks later I get a call from 
Denver and I was a candidate but for a procedure called 
Chemo-Embolization.I had this done in July and had a scan last 
month.With that scan and blood work (Including genetic testing) they 
think I might be in remission.So I figured since I might be around for a
 while more let's see if we can have my colostomy bag reversed.After 
talking to my doctor he thinks it's a very good possibility and I go in 
for surgery next week OCT.24th.<br/>Now the reason for the money is when 
we left Austin we left my wives daughters (who have been mine for the 
last 18 years),granddaughters,grandson,brothers,sister and her mom,not 
to mention both of our jobs (witch we both still have when we get back).
 We moved here to get me well and now that I am it's time to go back.As 
you can probably guess we've blown through our savings and can't afford 
to move back on our own.We don't like asking for help but sometimes life
 leaves you no choice.I know remission may last years or months so if it
 does come back and take me I just want to make sure my wife is back 
with her family.<br/>Well that's my story.It's been a rough couple of years but I'm looking forward to the future.<br/></p></div>","In Aug. 2011 at age 48 I was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer that

</div><div>EDMOND, Oklahoma -<p>A former Edmond school teacher battling Multiple Sclerosis went to Chicago for a life-saving stem cell transplant. She's back in town now with her results.</p>
<p>Pamela Gooch says she's the first person with Progressive Relapsing MS to have this particular procedure done. And since the transplant, she's never felt better.</p>
<p>""That just terrible tiredness is gone,"" said Pamela.</p>
<p>Back to her old, playful self, Pamela says her recent stem cell transplant has given her a new life.</p>
<p>""I can take a nap when I tire and I feel rested, however before, I couldn't get out of bed,"" Pamela said.</p>
<p>For two years since her MS diagnosis, Pamela always felt drained as her immune system was attacking itself. She even chopped off all her hair before chemotherapy beat her to it.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href=""http://www.news9.com/story/25422577/ok-woman-shaves-head-to-prepare-for-ms-treatment"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">5/3/2014 Related Story: OK Woman Shaves Head To Prepare For MS Treatment</a></em></strong></p>
<p>And in a 20 minute operation only offered in Chicago, she got new stem cells placed in her body. It was a success, until she got a letter from her insurance company backing out of covering the $150,000 procedure and instead opting to pay only a 1/10 of it.</p>
<p>""Pay for the rest of our lives for it, this is what we're going to do.""</p>
<p>Pamela proceeded on despite the high cost and seven weeks later, she's back home in Edmond. She got her pay-off in time spent with her two sons.</p>
<p>""I'm very excited to be home with my boys, and I have energy now that I can give to them in playing with them and cooking for them,"" said Pamela. ""And my main concern is being here for my family and trying to make up for the two years where I wasn't always available because of the MS.""</p>
<p>Due to the MS, Pamela had to quit her job as a Pre-K teacher.</p>

<b>THE INSURANCE COMPANY PULLED THEIR PLUG ON MY PRE-APPROVED STEM CELL TRANSPLANT BY PLAYING THE “TECHNICALITY” TRUMP CARD.</b> </h3>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</p><h4><b>DEVASTATION.  LITERALLY. </b></h4>
<p>I’m working with an attorney and going after the insurance company but that will take time, which is sadly, something I don’t have at the moment. In April, five new active lesions were discovered on my brain and I began to have difficulty walking. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to keep the stem cell transplant on schedule, the hospital needed $125,000 by May 15. Property was liquidated, extreme sacrifices were made BUT my family came up with the money. </p>

Posted: Jun 22, 2014 9:42 PM CDTUpdated: Jun 22, 2014 9:42 PM CDTBy Heather Hope, News 9
EDMOND, Oklahoma -A former Edmond school teacher battling Multiple Sclerosis went to Chicago for a life-saving stem cell transplant. She's back in town now with her results.
Pamela Gooch says she's the first person with Progressive Relapsing MS to have this particular procedure done. And since the transplant, she's never felt better.
""That just terrible tiredness is gone,"" said Pamela.
Back to her old, playful self, Pamela says her recent stem cell transplant has given her a new life.
""I can take a nap when I tire and I feel rested, however before, I couldn't get out of bed,"" Pamela said.
For two years since her MS diagnosis, Pamela always felt drained as her immune system was attacking itself. She even chopped off all her hair before chemotherapy beat her to it.

And in a 20 minute operation only offered in Chicago, she got new stem cells placed in her body. It was a success, until she got a letter from her insurance company backing out of covering the $150,000 procedure and instead opting to pay only a 1/10 of it.
""Pay for the rest of our lives for it, this is what we're going to do.""
Pamela proceeded on despite the high cost and seven weeks later, she's back home in Edmond. She got her pay-off in time spent with her two sons.
""I'm very excited to be home with my boys, and I have energy now that I can give to them in playing with them and cooking for them,"" said Pamela. ""And my main concern is being here for my family and trying to make up for the two years where I wasn't always available because of the MS.""
Due to the MS, Pamela had to quit her job as a Pre-K teacher.

NEW STRETCH GOAL: $40,000

Thanks to you, I’ve reached my original goal in just 12 days!

As it turns out, we found out the top of the mountain was not quite where previously thought…

On Tuesday, May 6, the day after beginning chemo treatments and three days after shaving my head…


THE INSURANCE COMPANY PULLED THEIR PLUG ON MY PRE-APPROVED STEM CELL TRANSPLANT BY PLAYING THE “TECHNICALITY” TRUMP CARD. 

The Impact

DEVASTATION.  LITERALLY. 
I’m working with an attorney and going after the insurance company but that will take time, which is sadly, something I don’t have at the moment. In April, five new active lesions were discovered on my brain and I began to have difficulty walking. 

In order to keep the stem cell transplant on schedule, the hospital needed $125,000 by May 15. Property was liquidated, extreme sacrifices were made BUT my family came up with the money. 

NEEDLESS TO SAY…

I HAVE A NEW STRETCH GOAL: $40,000

As promised, Dr. Lenny Henderson of Oklahoma City has graciously matched the first $5,000 donated to my Indiegogo campaign. We are off to great start and I'm in the process of sending out perks. 

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.  I PROMISE TO MAKE YOU PROUD.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p style=""font-size: 14px;"">Hi! My name is Kat and sometime in 2009 I was bitten by a tick. I would soon find that ticks are very powerful parasites: They have the ability to make you forget your name or phone number, say ""lettuce"" instead of ""gasoline"", cause debilitating pain and fatigue, make your facial muscles twitch uncontrollably, isolate you from your friends and family and leave you depressed, alone and broke. The cost of treatment for this highly controversial disease is in the tens of thousands...if you're lucky enough to be insured. </p>
<p style=""font-size: 14px;""><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p style=""font-size: 14px;"">By helping raise the money I need to pay for the treatments for Late Stage Chronic/Neurological Lyme Disease, you're helping a 28 year old girl have a shot at a normal life again. You're helping a girl go back to her life of adventure and activism. I want to inspire the world to be active in their life and the world around them whether it be philanthropic, social activism, socially responsible media or creative business ventures like TOM's Shoes. Since I've gotten sick, I haven't been able to volunteer, fund-raise or pursue any other avenue of social responsibility. My wish is that I will soon be able to return to this. </p>
<p style=""font-size: 14px;""><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Can Do</h3>
<div>The funds raised will go towards the cost of medical treatment for Late Stage Chronic Lyme Disease. Current treatments cost upwards of $1800 per month. My Dr has warned me of the possible necessity of a Port or PICC Line in order to administer daily IV infusions of Rocephin, which will increase the monthly cost of treatment by $1000. There is also roughly $5000 in lab bills, which I will scan copies of. The money I raise through this will go to medical expenses ONLY, NOT personal living expenses. </div>

Hi! My name is Kat and sometime in 2009 I was bitten by a tick. I would soon find that ticks are very powerful parasites: They have the ability to make you forget your name or phone number, say ""lettuce"" instead of ""gasoline"", cause debilitating pain and fatigue, make your facial muscles twitch uncontrollably, isolate you from your friends and family and leave you depressed, alone and broke. The cost of treatment for this highly controversial disease is in the tens of thousands...if you're lucky enough to be insured. 


The Impact
By helping raise the money I need to pay for the treatments for Late Stage Chronic/Neurological Lyme Disease, you're helping a 28 year old girl have a shot at a normal life again. You're helping a girl go back to her life of adventure and activism. I want to inspire the world to be active in their life and the world around them whether it be philanthropic, social activism, socially responsible media or creative business ventures like TOM's Shoes. Since I've gotten sick, I haven't been able to volunteer, fund-raise or pursue any other avenue of social responsibility. My wish is that I will soon be able to return to this. 


What You Can Do
The funds raised will go towards the cost of medical treatment for Late Stage Chronic Lyme Disease. Current treatments cost upwards of $1800 per month. My Dr has warned me of the possible necessity of a Port or PICC Line in order to administer daily IV infusions of Rocephin, which will increase the monthly cost of treatment by $1000. There is also roughly $5000 in lab bills, which I will scan copies of. The money I raise through this will go to medical expenses ONLY, NOT personal living expenses.

<p>Thanks so much for stopping by. On November 3rd, 2013 I will run
the Auckland Marathon (42.2km). In addition to testing my own physical
limitations, I hope to raise awareness and funds for an organization that I
strongly believe in called the Tony McClean Nepal Trust.</p>
<p>Tony McClean, a vibrant and much-loved teacher was tragically
killed in a 2008 canyoning disaster in the Central North Island that also
claimed the lives of six students. Tony had travelled extensively in Nepal and
had an incredible passion to address the poverty and injustice in the region.
He died leaving behind big, ambitious dreams for the Nepalese people and,
amazingly, his family and close friends were inspired to continue his work.
This materialised in the form of the Tony McClean Nepal Trust (TNT).</p>
<p>The birth of the trust is a remarkable example of a

gone from strength to strength and is actively making a difference in a place
of need.</p>
<p>The work of the charitable trust is centralised in the Lamjung
district, which is comprised mainly of Shudra communities. One of TNT's main
drives has been to improve the water supply in the region through the provision
of water filters. For <b>$65 NZD</b> a household in the Lamjung district can receive a
water filtration system that will last for more than ten years and avoid the dire consequences brought about by

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> My name is Christopher Feyrer. Like the infant above, I was born with esotropia, which means my eyes were out of alignment. For me, this lead to binocular suppression -- I can only see with one eye at a time. Both eyes, but never at the same time.   Throughout my life I've had faith in technology to figure out how to fix this issue, and I'm not stopping now. I've researched things like Brock strings, which help people with mine and similar disorders track objects in space to improve their vision and ability to see 3D.</p>
<p>I entered -- and won -- the #ifihadglass contest to begin developing these apps using Glass -- which will be a widely available consumer product with the technology to make these apps happen.  For some, it could mean strengthening a weaker eye through vision exercises.  For others, it could mean accessibilty to things in their peripheral vision. For still others,  it could mean seeing in 3D for the first time using exercises similar to the Brock string.</p>
<p>Four percent of people are born with an eye disorder like esotropia.  Most of us go on to leave functional lives, but why stop with functional? Why not push the envelope to make real 3D vision happen using technology; or at the very least improve ocular acuity and the ability of the eyes to follow one another, increasing self confidence? I feel this could make a huge difference in many people's lives. Tentatively, this app would be called Strong Eyes for Glass.</p>
<p>I also want to go this route so I can meet the Glass team at a pickup location and reiterate how important it is for them to make Glass accessible to people with eye disorders or one eye -- it could change their lives with the right applications, for the better. </p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> $2000 in 2 weeks.  Google was kind enough to extend my purchase window to the 22nd. So it's by then or bust.</p>
<p>The monies will cover the cost of Glass plus travel exepnses to go to the pickup location from my home in the midwest to the East or West coast (whichever has the cheapest flight) to pick up Glass and meet the Google team.</p>
<p>See the exciting list of perks to the right -- be involved with Strong Eyes development, get an eye education seminar, and more!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>Just a few days ago my husband and I were enjoying a sledding adventure with mother nature when Ken lost control of his inner tube and slid into a tree at a rather fast pace.  The impact resulted in Ken's neck being broken and surgery.  The doctors say that he will need time to recover so at least 3 months before he will be able to work.  The medical bills are piling up and our insurance refuses to pay for a majority of it. We need your help and support. Anything you can do will be appreciated!<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ken is the bread-winner of our home and without your help we will not be able to pay our rent, his medical bills, buy food, pay or utilities, and so forth.  I work but my income is truly not even close to enough for us to make it through this rough patch.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need help paying for the medical bills and some extra funds to add to my income to pay for our cost of living. If you help us you will know that your contribution won't go unforgotten or unappreciated and that your help made the difference between bankrupt and a quality of life.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there! We, S. (age 39, sperm in great condition) and J. (age 43, eggs old) have been trying for quite some time, both on our own, and with limited, low-tech, medical intervention to bring our baby into the world. We have recently had two biochemical pregnancies (very early miscarriages) and were told that this was actually a good sign! J. can get pregnant, but we just have to find a decent healthy egg.  A good egg.  We're both good eggs, you'd think we could manage to fertilize and implant a few, or one.</p>
<p>We've exhausted our available insurance, which doesn't cover IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) and are going to pay for treatment out of pocket through a well known local fertility clinic. We're going to do this through a combination of indiegogo, savings, acquisition of debts, and a loan against our retirement savings.  We consider ourselves very blessed and very lucky to have found love so late in life because we both dated some real doozies before finding each other. (The humorless vegan, the fake Secret Agent, and the last minute can-you-buy-me-dinner-woman always make us laugh. In retrospect.)</p>
<p>We want to have a baby together and raise it with values like: <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Knowing the difference between: you're and your; there, they're, and their; and too, two, and to.</li>
<li>Hate is not a family value; respect others.</li>
<li>Love your neighbor, even if they seem to suck sometimes (especially then.) Our faith is important to us.</li>
<li>Take responsibility for your community, and work toward awareness of critical issues affecting other communities beyond your own.</li>
<li>Vegetables are good for you; so is ice cream.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing is, we're not guaranteed success at this pregnancy thing, but given J's ""advanced maternal age"" time is running out to try. (And by the way, as you can see, she takes excellent care of herself. She has excellent egg reserve so the odds are better for us than for most geriatric senior potential mommies of her age.)  And we want to try everything we can before giving up, even if it means paying back debts for a few years.  That said, we'd like to reduce the debt we're acquiring which is how your supportive gifts will help.</p>
<p>We're asking for your help funding a single round of IVF medications which will cost between $5000-$7000. And our goal is on the low side of that amount. That seems to be a totally achievable goal, don't you think?</p>

<p>The whole treatment shebang (see what we did there?) is going to cost around $32,000 for IVF, ICSI, Assisted Hatching, and medications. We're participating in the multi-cycle discount program which gets us two IVF attempts. Medications are separate from the base cost of $18,000 so there are two separate 5-7K rounds to budget and consider.</p>
<p>Between taxes, fees from indiegogo, paypal, and credit cards from your lovely and very much appreciated gifts, even if we reach our goal, we won't get the full amount of one round of medication, so of course, we're hoping to go above and beyond! A number of friends, however, expressed their heartfelt desire to contribute to the opportunity to help us try to bring a little person into the world.</p>
<p>The kicker is... we have to pay the full amount up front... before we start the treatment (in early September). There will be no opportunity to gradually acquire medical bills and pay them off with our incomes. Up front payment, all at once, required. Ouch.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE: Note to all of our incredibly generous friends, supporters, anonymous contributors from here to Bangalore: If we happen to reach our goal before the end of the campaign, we will, of course, continue to fundraise and plug anything over and above into the other ridiculously expensive treatment costs if you don't mind.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm Jane Stewart Townsend. Since August 2009, I have been a Certified Reiki Master. Almost as soon as I received my certification, however, I felt that traditional methods of conveying the healing energy of Reiki as practiced in the United States were not conveying the level of healing energy in the way they were originally discovered and perfected by Dr. Mikao Usui in Japan. It soon came to me that I could use something else about which I knew--ironically, an old Japanese art form--the Temari ball, as a method of conveying a stronger, purer form of Reiki energy to my clients in exactly the places they needed it. Modern Temari balls are made from a Styrofoam base, similar to the Styrofoam balls people attached to old-style car radio antennae to strengthen radio reception. If those balls ""pulled in"" radio frequencies stronger, I thought, why would balls of the same material not serve to more effectively channel the healing energy of Reiki to the body's energy centers? I then developed a set of Temari balls corresponding to each of the body's energy centers, or Chakras. By placing each ball over its corresponding Chakra, I can convey a more direct, more intense form of Reiki energy to my clients without ever directly laying my hands upon their bodies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Shortly after my article ""Temari Reiki: A new hands-off approach to traditional Reiki"" was published in the International Journal of Nursing Practice, I was invited to a conference on cancer research in San Francisco by the OMICS Group, scheduled to take place October 19-23. Soon after that I was invited to present my article at that conference. I currently do not have the funds available to attend that conference, nor do I have funds available to do the kind of subsequent research into the way Temari Reiki affects clients with different forms of cancer, or other severe and chronic illnesses, including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In order for me to best apply--and to allow others to effectively apply--the healing effectiveness of Temari Reiki in the broadest ways possible, I need to be able to tell the medical community, directly, about what I have discovered, and to effectively conduct further research into its healing properties. To do this, quite frankly, I need money. And that is why I have turned to Indiegogo and its fund-raising forum for  help. And why I've turned to you, my potential funders, for the help I need.</p>
<p>You, as a funder, will help me attend a conference that is vital to getting the message about Temari Reiki out to the international medical community. But more importantly, it is vital to get word out of the successful results I and my clients have had with this new form of Reiki, and to allow it to help the largest number of people possible.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to raise $12000 by October 7, 2013. A portion of these funds will go towards my attending the OMICS Group Cancer Conference in San Francisco October 19-23, 2013. At that conference I'm scheduled to present and discuss my article ""Temari Reiki: A Hands-Off Approach To Energy Healing"" to the conference's attendees from around the world. The remainder of the funding will go towards further research into the effects of Temari Reiki in people with severe and chronic illness, including different forms of cancer and other severe and chronic illnesses, including those diagnosed with PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder).<br/></p>
<p>My ""perk"" offerings include:</p>
<p>--A custom-made Temari ball and a three-session Temari Reiki gift certificate for a contribution of $1000 or more;</p>
<p>--A three-session Temari Reiki gift certificate for a contribution of $750; </p>
<p>---A two-session Temari Reiki gift certificate for a contribution of $500, and</p>
<p>--A single-session Temari Reiki gift certificate for a contribution of $250.</p>
<p>The funds I do raise will still help me to make the trip to the conference (if possible) and will make a big difference in my ability to do more crucial research into the effectiveness of Temari Reiki.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm asking for your help because I need it to allow me to attend this conference, and to do subsequent research. Temari Reiki has helped many people by conveying energy to them to allow them to heal from many different ailments, from the chronic to the severe to the terminal. The OMICS Cancer Conference is bringing together dozens of physicians, scientists and researchers from around the world to discuss and share their findings of effective ways to treat cancer, and they feel that Temari Reiki, based upon my experiences and those of my clients, is a successful, non-traditional means of doing so. <br/></p>
<p>Your contribution will help not only me, but those who can  be helped by treatment of their illnesses through the healing powers of Temari Reiki. What you give to my efforts will not only allow me to attend this conference and to spread the word about Temari Reiki and its successes to an international medical audience, it will allow my to conduct more research into the healing properties of this new form of Reiki, and to work with thos who have a variety of medical conditions which Temari Reiki has the potential to help. This new form of Reiki, and those who will provide it, has the potential for a wide impact in healing those with chronic and severe illnesses.<br/></p>

<h1>Geared Wheels Help Wheelchair Users Regain Independence </h1>
<h3>Reinventing the Wheel.</h3>
<p>Just over five years ago a young, bright mechanical engineering student at the University of Illinois was sitting on the campus quad watching students race to get across the large sprawling campus to get from class to class in time. As he watched students walk and run and bike across the quad he noticed students in wheelchairs struggle as they pushed themselves to make it to class in time. In that moment Scott Daigle thought, ""I bet I could design some way of making wheelchairs easier to push and more efficient"".</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/12574/files/20130814160716-Scott_and_Chike_EP_2.jpg?1376521636"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>Over many busy days and long nights of hard work and innovation the IntelliWheels Easy Push geared wheels were created! The Easy Push wheels are a light-weight, low profile geared wheel that use a simple gearing design that makes pushing twice as easy! </p>

In that moment Scott Daigle thought, ""I bet I could design some way of making wheelchairs easier to push and more efficient"".



Over many busy days and long nights of hard work and innovation the IntelliWheels Easy Push geared wheels were created! The Easy Push wheels are a light-weight, low profile geared wheel that use a simple gearing design that makes pushing twice as easy! 
The IntelliWheels Easy Push












Introducing the Intelli-team.



The lean and innovative Intelli-team of mechanical engineer Scott Daigle, disability and community health expert Marissa Siebel, international wheelchair athlete and motivational speaker Joshua George have taken Scott's idea of geared wheels and are ready to introduce them to the World! 
Get to know the Intelli-Team!
The Intelli-team has worked together over the past three and a half years incorporating, securing funding, prototyping, testing, manufacturing, assembling, and are now ready to introduce the IntelliWheels Easy Push to the World!



IntelliWheels Launches Easy Push Wheel
""Our goal is to create technology that makes a positive impact in a person's life. By consistently using client feedback during development of the IntelliWheels Easy Push wheels we are confident that we have accomplished that goal and are excited to get our wheels into the hands of the people who need them."" - Marissa Siebel, Co-founder of IntelliWheels.
We Need Your Help to Keep IntelliWheels Rolling!
IntelliWheels needs your support to take Scott's idea from the middle of the cornfields of Champaign, Illinois into the homes and hands of wheelchair users over the world. 
$50,000.00 will go towards spreading the word and delivering the Easy Push wheels to those who need it worldwide.



The $50,000.00 will specifically go towards educating healthcare providers, durable medical professionals, and end users about the Easy Push wheels as well as provide the Intelli-team the means to travel to important trade shows worldwide. We believe that in order to successfully reach individuals in need and provide them with a more independent lifestyle we need to reach healthcare providers and professionals in the durable medical industry worldwide.




$20,000.00 directly funds a worldwide education campaign for healthcare providers, wheelchair users, and durable medical professionals to show how the Easy Push geared wheel keeps wheelchair users active and allows them to live a more independent lifestyle.

$30,000.00 will go toward funding the Intelli-team as they attend important durable medical trade shows, disability expos, and meet with individuals and organizations worldwide promoting and delivering more independence for wheelchair users through the IntelliWheels Easy Push. 









Helping The World Go Round.
The world population in 2008 was 6.7 billion. With 1% of the world population estimated to be wheelchair users, we could effectively estimate there are  67 million wheelchair users worldwide.  
Your contributions will help IntelliWheels reach more users and successfully introduce more wheelchair users to a greater sense of independence.






$25.00 - IntelliWheels with thank you for your support providing you with an IntelliWheels decal and T-Shirt to help you spread the word about independent mobility along with updates from the Intelli-team as they bring independence to people of all ages and abilities.  

$50.00 -  You will receive the IntelliWheels decal, T-shirt, and your name on the IntelliWheels website as a sponsor. You will receive a certificate of appreciation from the Intelli-team and a signed photo of IntelliWheels partner and international wheelchair racer Joshua George.
$75.00 -  For every 10 of these gifts, we will donate 1 set of IntelliWheels Easy Push wheels to a nursing home, children's hospital, or a veteran's hospital in need.  By pooling your resources with other sponsors, you can provide independent mobility to someone in need.
If desired, your name will appear on our website and to whom wheels were donated.
$300.00 -  Along with the gifts associated with the previous dollar amounts you get to choose an item of your choice to be featured in the video blog ""What can Josh George pull with the IntelliWheels Easy Push?!?"", items include and are not limited to; a car, a line of shopping carts, a boat on a trailer, a baby stroller, your uncle in his recliner...
$1,000.00 - Along with previous gifts you will also receive a set of IntelliWheels Easy Push wheels to keep or gift to a person, charity, Veterans Hospital or facility of your choice. If desired, your name will appear on our website and to whom the wheels were donated.
$10,000.00 - Along with the previous gifts you will also receive 12 sets of IntelliWheels Easy Push wheels to keep or gift to a person, charity, Veterans Hospital or facility of your choice.
If desired, your name will appear on our website and to whom wheels were donated.




Please Help IntelliWheels provide mobility options for aging individuals, pediatric wheelchair users, individuals with disease progression, or others that simply need a little help regaining their independence.

<p>If you are a mum, chances are you’ve experienced this: You go to a restaurant that was listed as child-friendly on Yelp or TripAdvisor. Turns out that they haven’t got a baby changing station, have never heard of baby bottle warming, oh wait -  you can’t even get the pushchair through the door!</p>
<p><strong>WowMum™ sets out to re-define the term <em>child-friendly</em>.</strong></p>
<p>We have devised a <strong>FREE</strong> app (yes you read it right, <strong>free</strong>) and a <a href=""http://www.wowmum.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> for parents to search for the right places to go when they're out and about. So whether they're looking for buggy-friendly cafés, emergency diaper changing, soft-padded play areas for toddlers, WowMum's got it covered.</p>

<p>It all happened on a particularly fine spring day.</p>
<p>We were out with a friend, pushing her newborn baby girl Sophie around London Bridge. All of a sudden, little Sophie started to get, well, a bit unhappy. It took 20 minutes of our peeking into random restaurants, interrogating waiters, crossing the Thames, to finally locate a café that was buggy-friendly, had a baby changing station, with a comfortable enough atmosphere for Sophie’s mum to breastfeed.</p>
<p>That was when we thought: There’s got to be an easier way.</p>
<p>The fundamental idea for WowMum™ was conceived in that café that afternoon. We want to help all the little Sophies and their mums find child-friendly places<i> easily, swiftly, elegantly</i> (the exact opposite of our exasperated state that day) when they are out and about.  </p>

<p>Fatima is a woman in sub-Saharan Africa who lost her baby because she couldn't get an emergency C-section.  Her remote village was 20 miles walking from the nearest health facility.  But the time she reached the hospital, the baby was in distress and there was no surgeon available to provide the emergency surgery.  Now, she can't have more children because of all the birth trauma she endured</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em><strong>What if you could impact the life of a mother and child today?</strong></em>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Cesarean sections are not available in many countries worldwide.  In fact, in some very poor countries, a mother in need of a C-Section may only have a 1 in 12 chance of having access to one! And her risk of death during child birth may be as high a 1 in 8</li>
<li>But C-Sections are only one type of surgery that is necessary in developing countries.</li>
<li>Trauma is a neglected epidemic in developing countries,causing more than five million deaths each year, roughly equal to the number of deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined!</li>
<li>GSC is working to change this by cataloging the availability of surgical and pain services in low income countries</li>

<li>At GSC, we envision <em>a world without barriers to safe surgery and anesthesia</em>. The GSC Vision is to provide the data and improvement measures to insure safe and cost-effective emergency and essential surgical care to all who need it.</li>
<li>It costs approximately $10,000 to survey one low-income country for our database.  Costs for database creation will exceed $100,000 over the next year and then at least $500,000 to create an internet-based open-source platform over the next five years.</li>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This database is the first of its kind.   It is valuable to the world, global organizations and donors because it pinpoints the needs and creates awareness for the importance of surgery and the live’s lost when emergency surgery is not available.  We have successfully collected data in 7 countries, providing the information in an open source format to assist global organizations in targeting their programs.  YOU can impact lives donating to this project allowing us to continue the data collection needed <em>today</em> to provide surgery in the <em>future</em>. </p>

<h3>The Story of Adopt One Village</h3>
<p><strong>Emmanuel Anim-Sackey</strong> left his village in <strong>Abetifi-Kwahu, Ghana</strong> in search of a better life. He achieved success as a U.S. postal worker in West Orange, NJ. But he longed to help support the village he left behind. So he founded <strong>Adopt One Village</strong>, a nonprofit organization that provides U.S. donations to this desperately poor village.</p>
<p><img alt=""Emmanuel"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.adoptonevillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/baba.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Adopt One Village Founder""/></p>
<p>For his efforts, Emmanuel was recognized as West Orange, NJ Citizen of the Year in January 2009. Later, he was recognized as Humanitarian of the Year by the U.S. Postal Service at a ceremony in Washington DC. Emmanuel is grateful for the recognition but he knows there is much more to do in his beautiful village home.</p>
<p>Emmanuel collects donations of used clothes and other supplies at the <strong>Adopt One Village</strong> warehouse in West Orange, NJ. He and his wife, Angela, are there daily collecting, sorting and preparing goods to be shipped to this impoverished region in Ghana. In addition, Emmanuel travels at least twice a year with volunteers from <strong>Adopt One Village</strong> to bring supplies and aid to Abetifi Kwahu. As the President of the Board, Emmanuel ensures that his vision for bringing sustainability to this region is always the main focus.</p>
<p><strong>Adopt one Village</strong> is 100% run by volunteers. We have no full time staff and we do not generally pay for services.  We rely on volunteers to perform many of the most critical steps towards the success of our efforts.  Your support goes <em>directly</em> to the place of need - whether that be to transport medical supplies or fund the trip of a doctor or dentist to the area.</p>
<p><strong>More information about the goals and efforts of Adopt One Village can be found at <a href=""http://www.AdoptOneVillage.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.AdoptOneVillage.org</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need to raise approximately $10,000 before the January, 2013 trip so we can arrange these items during our next trip,  Our volunteers on the ground in Ghana work on this project almost daily, but it takes a visit to insure that funds are properly distributed and that services are actually rendered.</p>
<p><em>(Any additional funds donated will help maintain the project well into the future)</em></p>
</div>
<div>We have already acquired a building in the center of the village, but it needs to be retrofitted to receive supplies and equipment.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have already performed a vast majority of the physical transformation of the building that has become ""The Life Clinic."" We still need to do the following:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Stock the building full of simple but essential medical supplies. (taking place in July, 2012)</li>
<li>Fund local medical professionals so they can make regular visits from the hospital in Abetifi to the rural village medical center. This medical center will serve hundreds of adults and children within the rural village and surrounding area.</li>
<li>Fund medical professionals and other projects to enhance the center as needed: We have a number of medical volunteers and professionals who have gone over and served. However, we would like to hold simple training sessions so that the local people can learn how to take care of minor wounds and issues on their own using the stock of supplies we will help maintain.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact is Great...</h3>
<p>One of our board members visited the rural village with Emmanuel in January 2010. At that time, many of the children had never even seen a Band Aid before.</p>
<p>A good number of the children had festering wounds on their legs and feet from infections. An impromptu medical mission was performed by the four volunteers who traveled over with Emmanuel using only their travel kits and some local supplies purchased as needed. Some of the children that were met during that trip have since passed away due to easily preventible causes. A number of the adults and parents have also passed prematurely because simple medical care is not available in the area.</p>
<p>Since then, we have acquired a building located at the center of the village, directly between two school buildings that is easily accessible by all of the children and their families. We have sent over three teams to work on the building (as well as the schoolhouse) and have added a new roof, security features to keep supplies safe, a new concrete pad around the building to help control erosion and more. </p>
<p>During the July 2012 trip, we will be installing cabinets within The Life Clinic. Critical supplies are arriving in late June via container shipment and will be distributed to the clinic as well as some of the impoverished local hospitals. A team of administrative and medical professionals will be on hand to organize the clinic and set it up so a local team of doctors can regularly visit.</p>
<p>The 2012 team is not just made up of the professionals mentioned above but also includes a group of teens from the USA who will deliver customized ""care packages"" to the local kids including hand written letters and other items to help encourage continued education.</p>
<p>A small donation today could literally save a life tomorrow...  And that is why we are doing much of what we do.</p>

<p>THE FACTS</p>
<p class=""Body1"">Over 2 billion people in the world suffer from biologically polluted water. Their drinking sources are often wells or rivers contaminated with biological parasites, germs and viruses. These issues keep them in a constant state of Gastrointestinal distress often causing diarrhea and illness. They simply cannot keep food down and get little nutrition out of what they do eat. They are literally starving to death because of the poor quality of their water.</p>
<p class=""Body1""> The lack of fresh water can be an insurmountable obstacle to living a good life. Without it people can't stay healthy, they can't stay in school or keep working. Without clean fresh water, the possibility of breaking out of the cycle of poverty is incredibly slim.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">Here is where 5 Minute Water comes into play. Our self-contained unit creates 32 oz. of biologically fresh water in under five minutes with <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">no</span></strong> chemicals, using totally natural UVC light. This simple to use product can create enough fresh water for a family of 4 in less then 15 minutes. It uses either a solar recharger/battery, 4 AA batteries or AC current and can be used anywhere in the world were fresh water is needed.</p>
<div>HOW IT WORKS -<strong> (watch the video above)</strong>
</div>
<p class=""Body1"">To use 5 Minute Water, you first clarify the contaminated water through a filter device or a T-shirt to remove rocks, sand and debris. (This is not necessary when water comes from the tap or well without debris but is still contaminated) Fill the 32 oz jar with the contaminated and clarified water. The 5 Minute Water UVL is then screwed onto the jar and plugged in for 5 minutes. The ultraviolet light then kills <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ALL</span> the parasites, germs and viruses. Our certified lab tests prove that just 2 minutes of UVC exposure creates biologically fresh water. It is a simple yet effective <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">non-chemical </span>all natural way to deliver life saving water to families around the world. With the 5 Minute Water system people with biologically infected wells and rivers can dramatically improve their health and nutrition.</p>
<p class=""Body1""><strong>CHECK OUT OUR LAB RESULTS AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR GALLERY PAGE</strong></p>
<p class=""Body1""> WHY WE NEED FUNDING</p>
<p class=""Body1"">With funding we can tool up to mass production and reduce the cost of each unit. Our goal is to sell a complete system, which includes a storage bottle, UVL unit and its jar, battery, and solar recharger/battery for just $129.00. We can then sell the complete system wholesale for just $99.00. The wholesale price will also be available to qualified mission programs and philanthropic groups. <br/> Imagine changing the lives of an entire family for just $99! We are hoping to raise $150,000, to reduce the cost of each unit, and get 5 minute water out into the world.  The lab tests are done, and our first model designs are now being tested and used in the real world.  With your help, we can tool up and bring biologically fresh water to those in need.  </p>
<p class=""Body1""><strong>For every $50,000 additional dollars we raise, we will donate 250 units ($25,000 worth of systems) to mission organizations. We have begun a relationship with Mission Volunteer Partners and other organizations, which will help us distribute systems to families in need.

Our goal is to sell a complete system, which includes a storage bottle, UVL unit and its jar, battery, and solar recharger/battery for just $129.00. We can then sell the complete system wholesale for just $99.00. The wholesale price will also be available to qualified mission programs and philanthropic groups.  Imagine changing the lives of an entire family for just $99! We are hoping to raise $150,000, to reduce the cost of each unit, and get 5 minute water out into the world.  The lab tests are done, and our first model designs are now being tested and used in the real world.  With your help, we can tool up and bring biologically fresh water to those in need.  
For every $50,000 additional dollars we raise, we will donate 250 units ($25,000 worth of systems) to mission organizations. We have begun a relationship with Mission Volunteer Partners and other organizations, which will help us distribute systems to families in need.

<p dir=""ltr"">Camp Out is the ONLY camp for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer<span>, sex 
and/or gender diverse and questioning teens</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> in the whole of Australia</span>! <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">
 Pretty incredible huh? We sure think so, that's why we, the 12 people 
who form the Camp Out crew, volunteer countless hours over the year to 
make Camp Out happen. All of us in the crew needed a camp like this when
 we were teenagers, a place to talk openly and honestly about our 
emerging identities and to be around other LGBTIQ teens with out the 
fear of being bullied or discriminated against, but we can't time travel,
 so we are doing the next best thing, making our dream a reality for the
 younger generation. We believe in, and have
 already witnessed the potential of Camp Out to deeply change young 
LGBTIQ youth's lives for the better! We are doing it for the love!!!<br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Last year saw our first ever camp, and the impact it had on the teens who came was truly phenomenal.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As some of you know I develop mostly KDE stuff, but last year I had a <a href=""http://dantti.wordpress.com/2011/04/17/there-is-still-hope/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">loss</a>. So when I moved to Argentina I sold a bunch of things and had to buy them again when I came back to Brazil, there are two still that I couldn't afford: A printer and a monitor.</p>
<p>Stuff I develop: Apper, colord-kde, print-manager, libdebconf-kde, packagekit-qt2 and aptcc</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The monitor is really important so I can use my desktop PC wich is far more powerfull than my work laptop, using my desktop allows me to run several VMs to test the different PackageKit backends and make sure Apper runs fine.</p>
<p>The printer is also important because as you know I also develop print-manager which got some real cool improvements but still misses some stuff, though it's not completly required to have a printer and do this development (which most of the time was done without real printers), I'm now in the adding a new printer phase, so yes I need a printer.</p>
<p><em>In short:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The monitor helps me mostly with testing my stuff on different distros and different setups.</li>
<li>In order to complete print support in KDE I need a printer to test adding new printers, checking if it's pluged, and so on..</li>

<p>To understand the values:</p>
<p><a href=""http://accessories.la.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=br&amp;l=pt&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=brdhs1&amp;sku=320-2807&amp;~ck=baynoteSearch&amp;baynote_bnrank=2&amp;baynote_irrank=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Monitor Dell 23""</a> costs R$ 799,00 -&gt; ~400,00 US$ (the same one is 250$ in US, Brazil and it's abusive taxes..)</p>
<p>Samsung SCX-3005w costs ~ R$ 450,00 -&gt; ~225,00 US$</p>
<p>I'm completely happy if I just reach the goal, so I can be more productive in my codings, if the goal is reached I'll consider your donnation as a personal help (which of course will help me keep coding in KDE).</p>

<p>If you can't help by donating that's ok, I still need people to test, code and even write docs.</p>
<p>print-manager and colord-kde need especial testing since it doesn't have much users.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Cory.  My Fiancee was hospitalized for multiple Pulmonary Embolisms and will have to be on blood thinners the rest of her life as we don't have any <em>solid</em> answers on what caused them. (For those unfamiliar a Pulmonary Embolism is a blood clot in your lungs, which is often fatal as they can travel to your heart or brain, causing a heart attack or stroke).  Luckily it was caught in time to hopefully prevent any further danger.</p>
<p>At first they said no go on the honeymoon and she was crushed.  She had been saving to take a trip to Paris for many years and has never been on a major trip... let alone the fact that it is our honeymoon.  But the doctors have now approved her to go.  However medical expenses, and related expenses, are threatening our ability to pay for it now.  Deposits have been made and contracts signed, so if it all falls through we also lose some of that money.</p>
<p>We've been trying to keep the wedding modest (it will be at our own home) to keep costs down.  It's hard to cut corners on such an important event.  She has had a bit of a rough life and I want to make sure the start of our marriage is remembered as one of the better times of her life.</p>
<p>Medical expenses are expected to be in the $15k-$20k range.  I've set the goal for $15k as I am hopeful we'll be able to cover the remainder with the amount of credit we have available to us.  If you cannot contribute, but would like to, please just spread the word.</p>
<p>All donations will go towards paying for medical and/or wedding and honeymoon expenses.  If we actually raise enough that all the debts are paid for we plan on contributing to other worthy causes here (we just found this site and there are a lot of deserving people out there).</p>
<p>Contributions of $25 or more will be able to look through a photography web site we jointly run (it's really just more of a storage site for our photography, but you can order prints from it) and select any single photograph which we will send you a high quality digital image of suitable for large scale printing (most of the files can be printed at poster size and still retain good quality).  I've intentionally not set perks for more than $25 as if you have that much to contribute there are many others here that can use your help.</p>

Here are the six most important components of this Indiegogo campaign for matters relevant to you, the customer:<p><b><i>1. Shipping Service: </i></b><br/><br/>Shipping charges are unfortunately unnavoidable, but we are absorbing a portion of these fees anticipating potential volume discounts.  listed in the Perks Section of the campaign, one must be included with every bike order. They will be arranged through USPS or UPS depending on your location. When your order is to be dispatched, you will be provided with a tracking number. As per our standards, all of our shipments are insured for their full value.  If there is an issue upon receipt or if, for some reason, the bike is damaged during shipping, we will work out a solution with you in a quick and efficient manner.</p>
<p>We have done it in the past with other products so we know what we're doing! Our logistics are in place and very tight...We have your back. </p>
<p><b><i>2. Shipping Delays:</i></b></p>
<p>After manufacture, your CHUB will be shipped by ground service to all orders located in continental USA or via air delivery for all oversees orders.  Therefore, depending on where you are located shipping should take between 3-15 days once it is out of our hands.  Please note that the shipment can be delayed based on issues out of our hands as this is an early stage startup. These delays may be due to 3rd party manufacturing and fulfillment delays, also additional delays while going through customs inbound or outbound for our global clients. Our team will be available to monitor your orders and answer your question during transit.</p>
<p><b><i>3. Shipping Charges: </i></b></p>

<p><b><i>4. Warranty:</i></b> </p>
<p>Unlike many other Indiegogo projects, we are already an incorporated company, this means we are fully accountable to our customers for any manufacturing defects and we hold customer service in the highest regard!  Each of our Chub fat tire bikes carry a lifetime warranty on the frame...Thats right LIFETIME!   Every other component carries a one year warranty. We will work with you as best we can in any situation that may arise, these are VERY durable performance machines, over engineered by design...Satisfaction guaranteed.</p>
<p><b><i>5. Assembly:</i></b></p>
<p>The bikes will be shipped 85% assembled. The wheels, handlebar, seat post as well as other minor components must be assembled upon receipt. Certain other minor adjustments might be required after assembly, such as the derailleur and the brakes. If you are not familiar with bicycle mechanics, we suggest you have it assembled by a professional in a local bike shop, or just give us a call we would be happy to talk you through basic adjustments!</p>
<p><b><i>6. General Feasibility:</i></b></p>
<p>Having previously launched multiple successful startups, we have had our share of trials and tribulations: that is the reality of all entrepreneurs. As a result, we had to work hard to execute solutions and successful action plans so we have a firm understanding of the road ahead.  It doesn’t mean that we expect a cake walk but we are ready and willing to face this challenge and follow-through with what we promise.</p>

<p>My mom lives in Casper, Wyoming. She has worked for the past twenty years as a nurse at Wyoming Medical Center. On August 4, 2013, she was working a night shift on the pediatrics wing when she began to feel ill. Less than five hours later, she was in critical condition and was rushed into emergency surgery. As we later found out, she had become infected with neisseria meningitidis, a highly fatal bacterium that can cause death in a matter of hours. In Lori’s case, the infection made her septic, sent her into multi-system organ failure, and put her in the hospital for over a month. As a result of this infection, Lori had several minor strokes, lost a portion of several toes, and has suffered permanent kidney failure. <br/><br/>Despite her otherwise remarkable recovery from the meningitidis infection, Lori has been on hemodialysis since mid-August 2013. She currently goes to dialysis at the Wyoming Kidney Center three times a week for about four hours each time. She takes multiple medications and has to limit fluid intake and follow a strict diet. She’s had three different catheters and a fistula implanted in her right arm to facilitate dialysis, and is currently awaiting further surgery on her arm. <br/><br/>Lori is currently listed on the national organ-sharing waitlist, but it can take many years to be matched with an organ, depending on the patient.<br/><br/>We are starting this page to help Lori in her search for a kidney donor, as well as starting this fundraiser to help with her medical costs. <br/><br/>For more info about being tested to match Lori please call Neshiyqah Nash - the Living Donor Coordinator Assistant at the University of Colorado Hospital - (720) 848 -0855 - tell her the patient is Lori Gutierrez.

She is blood type O+. <br/><br/>A living donor candidate is a person who is healthy, well-informed and makes a voluntary decision to donate one of their kidneys. Living donors must be over 18 and usually under 70 years of age. They must be in good general health, have a Body Mass Index (BMI) of less than 30, a non-smoker, with no evidence of significant high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, heart disease, or hepatitis. <br/><br/>A donor can live in any state and it is important to know that all medicals costs are covered by the recipient’s health insurance.

<h3>Do PoofPads really work?</h3>
<p>I came up with the idea for PoofPads
 when a friend of mine told me

 after he'd just let one go. He described how embarrassing and

 night I mocked up the first PoofPad prototype and asked him to be 
my first beta tester...and it worked! Since then I have tested it myself
 and had a couple other friends test it out as well. They all say the 
same thing: ""It may take a few practice poofs to make sure you direct 
the gas directly into the pad, but when you do PoofPad works every 
time!""<br/></p>
<br/><h3>How do PoofPads work?</h3>
<p>Each PoofPad contains 175 grams of activated charcoal and
has the absorbent surface area of over 75,000 square meters (150 basketball courts)! PoofPads not only
absorb flatulence (farts), but also other odors and gases, heavy metal ions,
carcinogens and even bacteria! PoofPads can also be used as a fragrance-free
deodorizer, or even a desiccant to pull excess moisture out of the air. </p>

<h3>How long do PoofPads last?</h3>
<p>We recommend you replace PoofPads every 4 months regardless of how often you use it. Once you open the outer bag, PoofPad begins absorbing odors, gases, water vapor, heavy metal ions,
carcinogens and even bacteria! Eventually, those 75,000 square meters of activated charcoal are going to bond with something and become less effective at bonding with your malodorousness.</p>

<p><b>How to do this: </b>any yogi who signs up for a training program or retreat offered as a perk in this campaign will automatically be enrolled in Indiegogo’s referral program, and YogaTrail will pay you back 50% of all the contributions made by your friends, family, or other people that you invite.

<p>These events are <i>exclusives:</i> attendance is limited to just 1 spot per event. We’ll be updating the descriptions daily about which events are still up for grabs. </p>
<p><b>Important:</b> once you decide which program you'd like to attend, simply purchase the perk on our Indiegogo page and leave us a comment letting us know which training or retreat you've just booked (so we can remove it from the eligible perks).</p>

<p>This App will solve a very common problem for yoga students everywhere, namely: <b>How to keep track of the class schedules of your favorite teachers and studios.</b></p>
<p>Why is it a problem? Because most people have <i>several</i> favorite teachers, and they like to take classes in more than one studio, too. But since the typical yoga instructor teaches classes in no less than 3 locations, it's a challenge to keep track of everyone’s schedule. Planning <i>your own</i> schedule usually means sifting through lots of studio websites and Facebook pages, and it can be very tedious just to figure out when and where you’ll be taking your next class.</p>
<p><b>The YogaTrail Mobile App will fix this and make it a breeze for yogis to keep up with their own personal yoga world (and with the larger yoga community as a whole). <i>Anywhere and anytime.</i></b></p>
<p>You’ll simply ‘follow’ your favorite teachers and studios to get everyone’s classes into one place (we call it the “Class Guru”). Planning your own practice will be easy!</p>
<p>The App will also keep you in the loop with what’s happening: <b>new classes, upcoming events, class changes and cancellations - you’ll be instantly notified on your phone. </b>And from the point of view of yoga providers, that’s a lot easier than sending newsletters, text messages, or trying to use Facebook to communicate!</p>
<p>Just like the YogaTrail website, our mobile app will be completely free, for everyone. Teachers and studios don’t have to pay to be a part of things, and that's in contrast to any other app out there (like 'MindBody Connect' for example, which only includes the paying client studios of MindBody Software ).</p>
<p><b>What’s also different: the YogaTrail mobile app will provide awesome coverage throughout the world, not just in the larger US yoga hubs. </b>So, you'll actually be able to use your phone to find and track your yoga when you need it most, like when you’re traveling.</p>

<p>With the exception of the teacher training and retreat events mentioned above, we’re also running a super-simple referral program:<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Get paid 20% on contributions by everyone you invite to this page.</b></p>
<p>Huh? Yes, really. No limits, and we’re not talking about “credit towards perks” — this is real cash that you can use to buy stuff, like food at the market. Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Sign into Indiegogo. If don't have an account, <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/accounts/sign_up"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">create one here.</a> You don’t even need to support the campaign (although that’d be wonderful too) — but you <i>must</i> be logged in to receive credit for your referrals. </p></li>
<li><p>Re-visit the YogaTrail Indiegogo campaign page, where you’ll now <a href=""http://help.yogatrail.com/article/119-how-to-use-indiegogos-referral-system"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">find your unique sharing link</a> to the left of our campaign video. Use that link to share the YogaTrail campaign on social media, email your friends and contacts, write a blog post, whatever you can think of.</p></li>
<li><p>All the contributions from people who come in via your link are meticulously recorded by Indiegogo (and you can <a href=""http://help.yogatrail.com/article/119-how-to-use-indiegogos-referral-system"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">keep track on your own personal dashboard</a> too). Then, at the end of the campaign, we’ll pay you using Paypal. </p></li>

<p>Like so many other yogis, we experienced first-hand the frustration that’s involved in finding the “right” yoga classes, teachers, and places.</p>
<p>And online, there wasn’t anything useful for the yoga community at all — despite the fact that there are over 100 million yoga practitioners worldwide, it's the 21st century, and Google has self-driving cars! Tools like Yelp and Google really don’t work for yoga, and it became obvious (to us at least) that the yoga world needed its own network.</p>
<p>So, we decided to make it happen and got to work in 2012. What started off as just a small project has now become something really big... and hundreds of lovely emails from users tell us every day that we were right: the yoga community <i>does</i> need its own network.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432013991/mtpp0atb7c5ynzhsszum.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>

<p>We have big plans for YogaTrail — but we’re also determined to keep the platform free. We’d rather not plaster the website with ads from clothing companies or other corporates, so we’re turning to the crowd.</p>
<p>It also seems to us as though the crowdfunding route is the best way to collaborate with our users and with the yoga community!</p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432054746/sksgkodqptxey0xrx1ku.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

But the reality is very different: we’re just 7 people (see below) who work way too much. YogaTrail consists of 3 developers and 4 people who do ‘all the rest’, from research and planning to design, testing, social media, writing newsletters, checking and editing all of the listings in the database and answering hundreds of daily support emails.</p>
<p>The success of this campaign will determine what we’ll be able to do. Various levels of funding will unlock the following:</p>
<br/><ul>
<li><p>$50,000: we build and release the YogaTrail mobile app in August</p></li>
<li><p>$90,000:  we upgrade our hosting (to make YogaTrail faster)!</p></li>

Now, for the most amazing perks in this campaign: 

Crowdfund Your Yoga Teacher Training or Retreat

No less than 40 exclusive spots in some of the most renowned yoga teacher training programs in the world are up for grabs – and a dozen deliciously exotic yoga retreats, too! We want you to live your dream, so here's the best part: we'll help you to crowdfund your program right here, as part of the campaign. You can earn 100% cash back simply by helping to get the word out(see below).
Browse the Teacher Training Courses here: http://asan.as/training


Browse the Selection of Retreats here: http://asan.as/retreats


How to do this: any yogi who signs up for a training program or retreat offered as a perk in this campaign will automatically be enrolled in Indiegogo’s referral program, and YogaTrail will pay you back 50% of all the contributions made by your friends, family, or other people that you invite. We'll make no profit on contributions from your referrals, full details here.
These events are exclusives: attendance is limited to just 1 spot per event. We’ll be updating the descriptions daily about which events are still up for grabs. 
Important: once you decide which program you'd like to attend, simply purchase the perk on our Indiegogo page and leave us a comment letting us know which training or retreat you've just booked (so we can remove it from the eligible perks).
So: don't let this opportunity pass you by! Learn more about how to crowd-fund your teacher training or retreat here.
This App will solve a very common problem for yoga students everywhere, namely: How to keep track of the class schedules of your favorite teachers and studios.
Why is it a problem? Because most people have several favorite teachers, and they like to take classes in more than one studio, too. But since the typical yoga instructor teaches classes in no less than 3 locations, it's a challenge to keep track of everyone’s schedule. Planning your own schedule usually means sifting through lots of studio websites and Facebook pages, and it can be very tedious just to figure out when and where you’ll be taking your next class.
The YogaTrail Mobile App will fix this and make it a breeze for yogis to keep up with their own personal yoga world (and with the larger yoga community as a whole). Anywhere and anytime.
You’ll simply ‘follow’ your favorite teachers and studios to get everyone’s classes into one place (we call it the “Class Guru”). Planning your own practice will be easy!
The App will also keep you in the loop with what’s happening: new classes, upcoming events, class changes and cancellations - you’ll be instantly notified on your phone. And from the point of view of yoga providers, that’s a lot easier than sending newsletters, text messages, or trying to use Facebook to communicate!
Just like the YogaTrail website, our mobile app will be completely free, for everyone. Teachers and studios don’t have to pay to be a part of things, and that's in contrast to any other app out there (like 'MindBody Connect' for example, which only includes the paying client studios of MindBody Software ).
What’s also different: the YogaTrail mobile app will provide awesome coverage throughout the world, not just in the larger US yoga hubs. So, you'll actually be able to use your phone to find and track your yoga when you need it most, like when you’re traveling.







With the exception of the teacher training and retreat events mentioned above, we’re also running a super-simple referral program:
Get paid 20% on contributions by everyone you invite to this page.
Huh? Yes, really. No limits, and we’re not talking about “credit towards perks” — this is real cash that you can use to buy stuff, like food at the market. Here's how it works:

Sign into Indiegogo. If don't have an account, create one here. You don’t even need to support the campaign (although that’d be wonderful too) — but you must be logged in to receive credit for your referrals. 
Re-visit the YogaTrail Indiegogo campaign page, where you’ll now find your unique sharing link to the left of our campaign video. Use that link to share the YogaTrail campaign on social media, email your friends and contacts, write a blog post, whatever you can think of.
All the contributions from people who come in via your link are meticulously recorded by Indiegogo (and you can keep track on your own personal dashboard too). Then, at the end of the campaign, we’ll pay you using Paypal. 

Told you it's simple - share our campaign and get paid. Seems like the best way we can show you our appreciation!


Like so many other yogis, we experienced first-hand the frustration that’s involved in finding the “right” yoga classes, teachers, and places.
And online, there wasn’t anything useful for the yoga community at all — despite the fact that there are over 100 million yoga practitioners worldwide, it's the 21st century, and Google has self-driving cars! Tools like Yelp and Google really don’t work for yoga, and it became obvious (to us at least) that the yoga world needed its own network.
So, we decided to make it happen and got to work in 2012. What started off as just a small project has now become something really big... and hundreds of lovely emails from users tell us every day that we were right: the yoga community does need its own network.


We have big plans for YogaTrail — but we’re also determined to keep the platform free. We’d rather not plaster the website with ads from clothing companies or other corporates, so we’re turning to the crowd.
It also seems to us as though the crowdfunding route is the best way to collaborate with our users and with the yoga community!


Visitors to yogatrail.com might imagine a large team with lots of resources behind the scenes to make it all happen. But the reality is very different: we’re just 7 people (see below) who work way too much. YogaTrail consists of 3 developers and 4 people who do ‘all the rest’, from research and planning to design, testing, social media, writing newsletters, checking and editing all of the listings in the database and answering hundreds of daily support emails.
The success of this campaign will determine what we’ll be able to do. Various levels of funding will unlock the following:

$50,000: we build and release the YogaTrail mobile app in August
$90,000:  we upgrade our hosting (to make YogaTrail faster)!
$135,000: we build a suite of tools for yoga providers (""YogaTrail Pro"")
$190,000: we build a booking platform for classes and events
$240,000: we make YogaTrail.com fully responsive for tablets and mobiles
$300,000: we translate YogaTrail into Spanish, French, and German
$350,000: we launch YogaTrail in Chinese and Japanese, too!
$500,000: we build the world's first yoga studio in Antarctica (just kidding, but we will do some really great stuff)",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>A New Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>In 2012, with help from Morocco's <a href=""http://www.indh.gov.ma/fr/index.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""National Initiative of Human Development"">National Human Development Initiative</a>, we opened our town's only public weight lifting gym.  The new gym has been a big success, and allowed us to serve our community in new ways.  One of the outcomes however, has been a large demand for handicap and injury rehabilitation services.  There is a large disabled population in our town and its five surrounding villages (Tounfit, Agbalou, Itzer, Tanwardi, and Tizit Lghashor), but there is no place for them to receive affordable treatment and in a convenient location.  This issue is close to our heart as our own founder, Silame Sidiali, who was confined to a wheel-chair after a work-related injury, suffers from this same problem.  Our campaign is about our new opportunity to meet this need, which we are prepared to do with the help of local trainers and the space in our new gym. </p>
<p><strong>What we are asking</strong></p>
<p>We lack the resources to purchase the remaining equipment for this project which is why we look to you for help.  Our athletic gym is equipped with great weight-lifting material.  To launch a program for Physical Therapy though, we need more specialized material designed for rehabilitation. </p>
<p>After consulting with local trainers and a doctor in Fes, we created a list of needed items and then contacted vendors in the city of Rabat to make a budget.  We highlighted the most important items to produce a realistic wish-list and budget that might go the furthest for a first-year physical therapy effort.  Our final list is made up of smaller, inexpensive items as well as a few larger ones grouped together for extremity (Arm, Leg, Hand, Finger, etc...) strengthening which many people in the community need.  These include:</p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This project is for the benefit of the community we live in.  Since the opening of our gym, we have been approached by many community members hoping to find rehabilitation services within.  Our town Boumia is small, rural, and too far from bigger cities where physical therapy is offered.  People live modest lives here and cannot afford large travel or medical fees.  Although we had not planned on offering physical therapy, we see this problem, recognize this need, and have been preparing ourselves to address it.</p>
<p>We have made a plan.  Along with our President Hamid Moussaoui who holds a degree in Sports Training, our friend Jileli Dadoosh who holds a degree in Physical Sciences, and a local nurse Hamid Risee have been hired to be our trainers.  Each is to receive further training with the equipment from a doctor based in Fes, who has pledged to visit our association upon purchase of the materials. </p>
<p>People here suffering from disability needs are prevented from receiving therapy due to distance and price.  With our location and our new gym, we are able to solve both of these problems.  Those from our town of Boumia, and from towns surrounding it - Tounfit, Agbalou, Tizit Lhagshore, Tanwardi, and Itzer - will be able to cut their travel time in half to nothing by us offering this service.  On top of these savings, we are able to reduce the price of therapy to nearly 25% to 50% per session of what it would cost in the city.  Rent and other overhead fees are much lower here because of our rural locale.  Plus, as a registered association with the Moroccan government, we make no more than we need to operate - the equivalent of an American non-profit.</p>
<p>While we had not anticipated this project, we are approaching it with the same passion and commitment that we do toward all our track and field related work.  Our responsible track record in this area earned us the rank of 36 out of 460 registered associations by the Moroccan Federation of Athleticism in 2012.  We support the pursuit of Health and Fitness through whatever means possible and for whatever population possible.  For us though, addressing physical disability is especially important as our founder, Silame Sidiali, became disabled years ago while working to harvest apples (<a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/PTmilouya/x/2114365?c=gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Silame Sidiali"">Hear his story on our gallery page</a>).  His energy and passion for athleticism created this association and to him we are dedicating the successful completion of this project. </p>
<p>A contribution to our campaign will help us fulfill this dedication.  It will also help us provide a unique opportunity for an underprivileged and deprived population.  We ask that you help us put these friends of ours back on their feet and feeling stronger!  No contribution, big or small, will go underappreciated. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

<p>Well, once upon a time in the tiny village of Jafre, just outside of Gerona in Spain, there was a spring with drinking water that was discovered to have healing powers. Around the spring were other springs with thermal water, also rumored to be healing. Modern science confirmed many, many years later that thermal baths and certain mineral content in water can indeed be healing for the body.</p>
<p>Just outside of Jafre someone bought up some land a few years back and started building a spa resort. Then recession hit and the resort was left 60% complete.</p>
<p><img alt=""The site"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://projectillum.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/VENUE-JAFRE.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The site as it is now - beautiful, but unfinished !""/></p>
<p>Now, a few years later the land is up for sale and many people want to turn it into commercial developments, whereas we would love to ensure that Jafre once again becomes a healing centre and that the natural beauty of the land isn’t destroyed. So we want to create <a href=""http://www.projectillum.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Project ILLUM"">Illum</a> – a wellness centre and Eco-retreat where different holistic therapies come together with natural beauty and gastronomy. Below are images of the Illum we envision – complete with an auditorium, labyrinth, meditation pavilion, thermal baths, tree of life and of course, charming eco suites for our visitors.</p>
<p> <img alt=""The future !"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://projectillum.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/fgwpBeMCxGd339nPE9k-Y5Zq_JyRt38tWUP01AAyoW9usDKiY9UaqyPMRNj3eDnMQcuWyJAXTUP8QZ7clAB2ZPyWD4GU8okkendG7tFZ7owzM7Mfr828PxZd6FwPYg-Ev9LM8iTQHUtAYB3hJbZxUQ1.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The future !""/></p>
<p>Because of the economical crisis it is also very important for the village and the entire province where it is situated that job opportunities are created and that people start spending money in the area. Therefore the Mayor of Jafre is very excited about Illum and not only because of jobs being created, but also because of the cultural exchange that will be made available and for visitors to experience the healing benefits of the springs. (You can read an interview with the Mayor <a href=""http://projectillum.com/interview-with-joan-bonany-rocas-the-mayor-of-jafre/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Interview Joan Bonany"">here</a>.)</p>
<h3>So what do we need our funds for ?</h3>
<p>Currently it's difficult to get seed money from banks in Spain as there's an ongoing recession. We need the seed money to do the leg work to prove to investors why <a href=""http://www.projectillum.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Project Illum"">Illum</a> is a feasible plan. To do this we first of all need to hire a company like HVS (<a href=""http://www.hvs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.hvs.com</a>) whom will provide us with a complete feasibility and economical report of our project. This costs around $50,000. Then we have to pay for a number of architectural and engineering plans, research of the water, legal and financial advice and so on. That will cost another $600,000(!!!). However, the most important thing is to raise the initial $50,000. From then on it will be easier to get investors to invest the remainder of the seed money, although of course it would be nice to raise the remaining $600,000 by ourselves. (You can read a summary of what that sum of money will be used for <a href=""http://projectillum.com/campaigns/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Campaign info"">here</a>.)</p>
<p>We are already talking to investors and they are watching this campaign as we speak. Therefore it’s important for us to raise as much money as possible to prove that there is a demand from the public for Illum.</p>
<p><img alt=""The future !"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://projectillum.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/KmeYbqQERXRCqwk-gejuYhMRObMZ5XzjE1-Nb36IFMMEt5FLkWcu3iDKFmPYB0HIdBwNPaBs-9IhtkAuuqaf3IesRFFbelZb4J88foUp77AE8Gk48XCgLlBFrhN0_RjUc11.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The future !""/></p>
<p>If we don’t reach the necessary amount of money we will continue fundraising through our website. Also, the more we raise, the more we can do, even if it’s not $50,000 – then we just have to start with a smaller report, or find other ways to raise the rest of the money. For example we can potentially convince someone to invest in us to breach the gap between what we have and what we need for the initial report from HVS. Every little step helps.</p>

<p>I am an “Atmospheric-Architect” and the owner of Mind:Style. Mind:Style conceptualizes architectural design solutions and sustainable environments for a number of different kinds of businesses. I am a storyteller who from beginning to end provide guidance to architects, landscapers, interior designers, consultants and other creative specialists.</p>

<p>As a storyteller, sometimes I encounter the first seeds of a story that I truly want to be the author of. Project Illum is one such story.</p>
<p>Growing up I used to visit the tiny village of Jafre, in Spain just outside of Gerona rather frequently. My parents later moved there for a good couple of years, so I would continue to visit it as an adult.</p>
<p>Jafre is a beautiful medieval village with a mere 452 inhabitants, but what makes it so extraordinary is that it has an ancient spring, known for its healing properties. Already back in the 1400’s people gave testimonials in court that they had been cured, or watched someone cured by the spring.</p>
<p>One day a farmer in Jafre met a man who was crossing his fields. The man stopped to tell the farmer that the spring with its medicinal powers should be protected by a shrine. The farmer asked the man how he would know that it was the truth? The man said that a baby would die in the village and then left the farmer. The farmer set off to the village to tell the villagers what had happened and was welcomed by the church bells announcing the death of a baby. Consequently, the villagers built a shrine for the spring.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Fuente Santa Jafre"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://projectillum.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-06-11.46.14.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Fuente Santa Jafre""/></p>
<p>Today, around 600 years later I am trying to do what the man did – protect the spring by building a shrine of sorts. Because of my association with the village of Jafre, which I love, and because how much the villagers truly need more sources of income, as well as an ability to protect the land they love, this project means a lot to me. I have talked a lot to the Mayor of Jafre about this and you can read our interview with him here.</p>
<p>Of course I am also passionate about it because of the vision we have – the vision of building a wellness centre that heals you from the inside out. The different therapies, the beauty of the land, the food, the gardens, the spring and our thermal baths…it will create an extraordinary experience for anyone who visits.</p>

<p> </p></div>","What are we trying to do and why?
Well, once upon a time in the tiny village of Jafre, just outside of Gerona in Spain, there was a spring with drinking water that was discovered to have healing powers. Around the spring were other springs with thermal water, also rumored to be healing. Modern science confirmed many, many years later that thermal baths and certain mineral content in water can indeed be healing for the body.
Just outside of Jafre someone bought up some land a few years back and started building a spa resort. Then recession hit and the resort was left 60% complete.

Now, a few years later the land is up for sale and many people want to turn it into commercial developments, whereas we would love to ensure that Jafre once again becomes a healing centre and that the natural beauty of the land isn’t destroyed. So we want to create Illum – a wellness centre and Eco-retreat where different holistic therapies come together with natural beauty and gastronomy. Below are images of the Illum we envision – complete with an auditorium, labyrinth, meditation pavilion, thermal baths, tree of life and of course, charming eco suites for our visitors.
 
Because of the economical crisis it is also very important for the village and the entire province where it is situated that job opportunities are created and that people start spending money in the area. Therefore the Mayor of Jafre is very excited about Illum and not only because of jobs being created, but also because of the cultural exchange that will be made available and for visitors to experience the healing benefits of the springs. (You can read an interview with the Mayor here.)
So what do we need our funds for ?
Currently it's difficult to get seed money from banks in Spain as there's an ongoing recession. We need the seed money to do the leg work to prove to investors why Illum is a feasible plan. To do this we first of all need to hire a company like HVS (www.hvs.com) whom will provide us with a complete feasibility and economical report of our project. This costs around $50,000. Then we have to pay for a number of architectural and engineering plans, research of the water, legal and financial advice and so on. That will cost another $600,000(!!!). However, the most important thing is to raise the initial $50,000. From then on it will be easier to get investors to invest the remainder of the seed money, although of course it would be nice to raise the remaining $600,000 by ourselves. (You can read a summary of what that sum of money will be used for here.)
We are already talking to investors and they are watching this campaign as we speak. Therefore it’s important for us to raise as much money as possible to prove that there is a demand from the public for Illum.

If we don’t reach the necessary amount of money we will continue fundraising through our website. Also, the more we raise, the more we can do, even if it’s not $50,000 – then we just have to start with a smaller report, or find other ways to raise the rest of the money. For example we can potentially convince someone to invest in us to breach the gap between what we have and what we need for the initial report from HVS. Every little step helps.

Who is Stan Colders, the man behind Illum?
I am an “Atmospheric-Architect” and the owner of Mind:Style. Mind:Style conceptualizes architectural design solutions and sustainable environments for a number of different kinds of businesses. I am a storyteller who from beginning to end provide guidance to architects, landscapers, interior designers, consultants and other creative specialists.
 
As a storyteller, sometimes I encounter the first seeds of a story that I truly want to be the author of. Project Illum is one such story.
Growing up I used to visit the tiny village of Jafre, in Spain just outside of Gerona rather frequently. My parents later moved there for a good couple of years, so I would continue to visit it as an adult.
Jafre is a beautiful medieval village with a mere 452 inhabitants, but what makes it so extraordinary is that it has an ancient spring, known for its healing properties. Already back in the 1400’s people gave testimonials in court that they had been cured, or watched someone cured by the spring.
One day a farmer in Jafre met a man who was crossing his fields. The man stopped to tell the farmer that the spring with its medicinal powers should be protected by a shrine. The farmer asked the man how he would know that it was the truth? The man said that a baby would die in the village and then left the farmer. The farmer set off to the village to tell the villagers what had happened and was welcomed by the church bells announcing the death of a baby. Consequently, the villagers built a shrine for the spring.
 
Today, around 600 years later I am trying to do what the man did – protect the spring by building a shrine of sorts. Because of my association with the village of Jafre, which I love, and because how much the villagers truly need more sources of income, as well as an ability to protect the land they love, this project means a lot to me. I have talked a lot to the Mayor of Jafre about this and you can read our interview with him here.
Of course I am also passionate about it because of the vision we have – the vision of building a wellness centre that heals you from the inside out. The different therapies, the beauty of the land, the food, the gardens, the spring and our thermal baths…it will create an extraordinary experience for anyone who visits.

When I was a baby, she fell while holding me and twisted her right ankle, so she has a 4 inch screw in that ankle. She survived a blood clot in her brain, the left side of her skull is a plate. She sliced off her right thumb in a factory, it was stitched back on. She then slight her left hand index finger down to the first digit, which could not be reattached. And 3.5 years ago she was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer that had already spread to her ovaries. She had a hysterectomy and bowel resection. In 2010 the cancer spread to liver and she had her right lobe resected. In Dec. 2011 the cancer is back, with a spoton her lung and a small tumor pushing on her right ureter which was inhibiting urine from her kidney to her bladder. Every three months she would go in to the urologist and get a stent replaced to allow urine to flow. Two weeks ago, the tumor had become so big that it twisted her bowels and she need emergency surgery to untwist her bowel. The tumor is on a major artery and could not be removed. We are currently seeking alternative treatments and will be going to Toronto's Medicor Cancer Center.</p>
<p>Back in her hay day, my mother had a red convertible that she loved dearly. For the past 30 years all she has ever wanted was a red convertible. My goal is to get her a used red convertible and let her drive with her top down and hair blowing before she becomes bedridden.

<li>My name is Curt McLean and I am a born Jamaican,but I live in Canada now. For the past years I have been going Back to my country to referee basketball games and there are a lot of kids that are in the community,some of them don't even have shoes on their feet,shirt on their backs and some have torn clothes on. I was so upset to see all these kids looking like they have no parents as I did my game. After the game was over I sat with some of them and bought them some food and asked where their parents are and and when they told me they don't no,it mad me cry.</li>
<li>So at that point I said to my self,what can i do to help these poor kids who have nothing in life to look forward to?So as I see that they love the game of basketball why not go back and teach them the basic skills of the sport and show them some love that they can not get at home. All these kids want is some attention and love and that is what we are going to try to do.</li>
<li>Just imagine how a child feels getting a gum or candy,with your help these kids can look forward to another day as we go into the community and have a camp for about 400 of them, clothes them,feed them and even supply shoes for them.I can just imagine how they would feel so loved and appreciative,I think that this will for sure make a life difference for the parents and the community it self would gladly embrace us for doing what we have done for their child and the life we have just changed. </li>
</ul><p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p><ul><li>The funding that is needed will pay for the following: we need 2 back boards and rims which is about $500 USD each,we would love to put some bleachers in so the parents and community can watch the games,there is not enough light there for night games so we would like to put one more light pole in,we also would like to re do the courts with  new lines and rubber  surface area as the bad weather really takes a toll on the concrete which is not good for the kids if the fall down. So in total for this court it will be around $50,000 or so. If we do not reach our goal we would fix what we can with what we get and continue to raise funds until goal is reached.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:</p><ul>
<li>I think this project is  very valuable because of what you are doing to help keep the youth off the streets as if there is no basketball court means that they will have to roam the streets and get them selves in trouble with the law,so you are showing the kids that you care about their well being. I have been working in Toronto in the same kids of communities for many years now and I can say that I have changed many lives.</li>
<li>Make it real for people and build trust.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>for all those that want to help but they cant ,we need t-shirts,running shoes,socks,clothes,basketballs,basketball uniforms and what ever else you can come up with,what ever is provided to us is much appreciated as the families will be so great full. So please spread the word about the inner city basketball camps to all your friend,co workers,family and employer and let them know to go to Indiegogo and pledge,thank you.</p></div>","Short SummaryContributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust.

</p><p><b>What about ring
sizes? When do backers get to choose their ring size?</b> <br/><br/>
ThumbTrack™ fits small and large fingers alike due to the detachable back-section
of ThumbTrack™ being made from a flexible rubber-like material. <br/><br/>
We provide all backers with 3 differently sized back-flaps (S, M, L) to
guarantee a 100% snug fit. <br/><br/><br/><b>Is ThumbTrack™ available for left-handers?</b> <br/><br/>
The device can be worn either on your left or right hand without restrictions
in usability. <br/><br/><br/><b>What material is ThumbTrack™ made of?</b> <br/><br/>
The surface part and some inner structural parts of the thick section are made
from ABS plastic. The thinner section is made from a rubber-like material and
the whole inner lining as well as the sides are rubberized. <br/><br/><br/><b>Is ThumbTrack™ waterproof?</b> <br/><br/>
The device is resistant to sweat and the occasional splash. <br/><br/><br/><b>What colors does the ThumbTrack™ come in?</b> <br/><br/>
The device is available in Pitch Black and Pure White. <br/><br/><br/><b>What kind of warranty do you offer?</b> <br/><br/>
We offer a one year limited international warranty against manufacturing
defects for the main unit, the Nano USB
Dongle and rubber back-flaps.</p>
<p>We offer a 6 month limited
international warranty against manufacturing defects for the inbuilt battery
and a 1-month exchange warranty for the charging cable.<span>  </span></p>
<p>In all warranty cases, you will need to
pay for shipping to the nearest service center. <br/><br/>
Service center partners who provide repair or exchange services will be based
in the United States, Europe and Hong Kong. <br/><br/><br/><b>How long does the battery last?</b> <br/><br/>
The End-of-Life span of the Li-ion battery will occur in approximately three
years. <br/><br/>
On a daily basis the device works for approximately 15 continuous hours without
needing to recharge, depending on your usage and charging scenario. <br/><br/>
Battery re-charge time from empty to full will take approximately 2 hours. <br/><br/><br/><b>Can I replace the battery myself?</b> <br/><br/>
We advice against replacing the battery yourself. The custom manufactured Li-on
battery is not commercially available and is encased in the ring. <br/><br/>
Once the battery is worn down, you can send us your ThumbTrack™ and we’ll
replace the battery for a small fee. <br/><br/><br/><b>Is ThumbTrack™ an HID Device?</b> <br/><br/>
Yes, ThumbTrack™ and the RF receiver are HID compliant. <br/><br/><br/><b>Do I have to install the provided software to make ThumbTrack™ work?</b> <br/><br/>
No, the software only adds extended features. As soon as you plug in the tiny
wireless USB receiver / dongle into your Windows, Linux PC or Mac -  your
ThumbTrack™ is instantly functional. <br/><br/><br/><b>Which devices and Operating Systems will ThumbTrack™ work on?</b> <br/><br/>
ThumbTrack™ devices and software is compatible with OSX 10.6.8 and upwards as
well as Windows XP, Win 7, Win 8 upwards and Linux. <br/></p><p><span><br/><b>Does ThumbTrack™ work on Android and iOS?</b> <br/><br/>
ThumbTrack™ is not supported on Android and iOS. <br/><br/><br/><b>Is ThumbTrack™ based on Bluetooth Technology? </b><br/><br/>
ThumbTrack™ operates on a 2.4 GHz Radio Frequency similar to Bluetooth and runs
a custom-written protocol for communication between the wireless USB
dongle/receiver and ThumbTrack™. <br/><br/>
We have opted for this alternative hardware and software solution because: <br/><br/>
- Our protocol is more device specific than the general Bluetooth protocol <br/>
- It provides superior battery life<br/>
- It provides better connectivity (less disconnect issues and no pairing
issues)<br/>
- It allows us to offer ThumbTrack™ at a more affordable rate to you as we
won't need to license Bluetooth technology<br/><br/>
For the same reasons, established computer peripheral manufacturers such as
Microsoft and Logitech use their own proprietary 2.4 GHz protocols instead of
Bluetooth, for most of their computer mice. <br/><br/><br/><b>Who can order?</b> <br/><br/>
ThumbTrack™ is available worldwide to all countries excluding residents of
countries that fall under US embargo and residents of Belize due to local laws.
<br/><br/><br/><b>Can I get multiple perks?</b> <br/><br/>

runners. With 100% all natural ingredients, it's a cool, healthy snack 
after a run!


In the battle of runners against sugary sports drinks, only one brand can save the running community!
Runners NEED to hydrate, so they pick up those commercial sports 
drinks that are packed with artificial flavors and sugars because there 
is no other option on the market for them. Introducing... RUNNER POPS!
 Runner Pops are the world's first Sports Hydration Ice Pop 
made for runners! Made with 100% all natural ingredients, Runner Pops 
are a refreshing, HEALTHY, and of course, a DELICIOUS way to hydrate 
after a run!





""As a runner, I always want to perform my best! In order to do so, I 
need to fuel my body with ONLY the best to KEEP ON RUNNING!""




The Goal of the Runner Pops Campaign
If I'm able to 
raise the necessary funds, I intend to use the money to get all the 
necessary permits, rent a commercial kitchen, and start making inventory
 to approach stores and races so that they can stock Runner Pops, and 
make it easy for you to get them for your next run!
In the 
beginning, I plan to approach specialty running shops, local grocers, 
etc. Once I receive the constant support of the Runner Pops fan base, I 
will then try to get it into bigger markets.

There are tears, sweat and blood in this project.We are an Industrial Design Company and we focus on the balance between beauty and function. My name is Jose Antonio Viladoms and I am a passionate diver who always found  problems with my diving equipment, so as a designer I took on the task to resolve on how to free my vision under water;  after all, diving its about sight seeing.  And that is how Aak Diving was created, with an incredible and passionate group, that wants to create better equipment, for better diving. We took this amazing ride to create the first single lens peripheral vision diving mask.  At this point, we are thrilled, happy, and scared all at once. And in need of your help to finally take the AAK 180 Diving Mask to production.THE AAK 180 DIVING MASKThe 180 Aak Diving Mask is designed to give greater vision.
