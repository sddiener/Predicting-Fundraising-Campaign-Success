<p>In support of poets and independent publishing, I’m asking for your help in producing my fist volume of poetry. This collection of poems represents a culmination of writing and exploration, deepening primarily over the course of the last ten years. I have secured publishing through Mercury Heartlink, a respected small press in New Mexico, with a publishing goal of early November, 2016. The success of my campaign will allow for editing and publishing of this volume of poems, and continuing my writing, as well as sustaining me during the balance of this process, and for promotion of the book – not included in publishing cost. It will also allow me to focus on completing and shipping the accompanying artwork for the campaign rewards, and for the book itself. Additionally, I plan to create a neighborhood offering of a small poetry library in front of my home on the very busy street where I live in Santa Fe, NM.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473619631/video_overlay_qeedpm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>I am relying on social media and word of mouth to make this campaign and project known to a broader audience. Please ask your friends to visit, and share this opportunity on your social channels.<span>  Thanks for your support!</span></p>
<p>My goal is to raise $5500. This will help pay for an initial print run of Hair on Fire from the printer, and will cover shipping to my home for storage and distribution as rewards to donors. This amount will also cover the creation of any ancillary perks claimed by contributors and the shipping of these items.</p>

<p><strong>All IndieGoGo orders will be sent out in early June 2017</strong></p>
<p>Sophie McKeand is an award-winning poet from north Wales with a love for exploring different ways to create poetry. This crowdfunder is to raise funds to cover production costs through pre-orders for a beautifully produced hardback first edition of Sophie's first full collection <i>Rebel Sun</i> with additional perks from arty postcards to live recordings or a spoken word gig in your own house! </p>
<p><strong>Young People's Laureate Wales April 2016 – 2018<br/>Winner of the Out Spoken award for Innovation in Poetry 2015<br/>Longlisted for the Poetry Society's National Poetry Competition in 2014</strong></p>
<p><strong>What they say about the <i>Rebel Sun</i> poems:</strong></p>
<p>'<i>Sophie McKeand is a force. Her 'heart is anchored' in the nature and topography of North Wales. She is intimately engaged with the elements and agents which form landscape.  Sophie 'speaks hurricanes' and lakes, rain and rocks. In performance and on the page she understands rhythms and controls tides of feelings. Sometimes her images are as sharp and exact as cut slate; other times she glides on experimentation. She has a deep concern for people in danger of alienation and animals threatened with extinction. And she loves lurchers!' </i><strong>– Chris Kinsey</strong></p>
<p><b>'</b><i>Sophie joined us on stage at The Good Life Experience in 2016, where she captivated the audience with her profound, mythological, musical poems that not only crossed borders but seemed to dismantle them entirely, collapsing time and space and merging visions of the past with narratives of the personal.' <strong>–</strong></i><strong> Caught by the River</strong></p>
<p>'<i>A firecracker of a collection. Ideas explode off the page, words pop and fizzle, language and form are ignited and illuminated with the ingenuity of McKeand's searingly bright imagination.'' <strong>–</strong></i><strong> Kaite O’Reilly</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sophie says:</strong></p>
<p>'This is the first time I will work with a publisher and I approached <a href=""http://www.parthianbooks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Parthian Books</a> because they understand the artistic vision and because I have a lot of respect for their editorial team as well as the artists they’ve supported and publications they’ve created over the years.</p>
<p>'The previous pamphlets (<i>Prophecy</i> and <i>Hanes</i>) and the album (<i>DRKMTR</i>) were limited-edition and hand-crafted but after a combined total of nearly 1000 units my fingers are sore so I felt it was time to upgrade, while still finding a way to make the publication memorable. This is why I’m delighted that Andy Garside is again making the work look gorgeous – I love the cover artwork and it’s had some really positive response already.'</p>

<p>'If you’ve dropped by and don’t fancy buying anything but like the idea of this please share the page on social media and with your friends. This collection is experimental in parts and more lyrical in others because that’s the way I see the world and I hope you enjoy experiencing life through my eyes for a time.'</p>

'Sophie joined us on stage at The Good Life Experience in 2016, where she captivated the audience with her profound, mythological, musical poems that not only crossed borders but seemed to dismantle them entirely, collapsing time and space and merging visions of the past with narratives of the personal.' – Caught by the River
'A firecracker of a collection. Ideas explode off the page, words pop and fizzle, language and form are ignited and illuminated with the ingenuity of McKeand's searingly bright imagination.'' – Kaite O’Reilly
Sophie says:
'This is the first time I will work with a publisher and I approached Parthian Books because they understand the artistic vision and because I have a lot of respect for their editorial team as well as the artists they’ve supported and publications they’ve created over the years.
'The previous pamphlets (Prophecy and Hanes) and the album (DRKMTR) were limited-edition and hand-crafted but after a combined total of nearly 1000 units my fingers are sore so I felt it was time to upgrade, while still finding a way to make the publication memorable. This is why I’m delighted that Andy Garside is again making the work look gorgeous – I love the cover artwork and it’s had some really positive response already.'

'We’re selling up to live in a van within the next 12 months and this collection is an exploration of why this is, with a strong socialist/Marxist undercurrent. It would be great to have a lovely book to take on tour across the UK and Europe to promote Welsh poetry and my work.'
'If you’ve dropped by and don’t fancy buying anything but like the idea of this please share the page on social media and with your friends. This collection is experimental in parts and more lyrical in others because that’s the way I see the world and I hope you enjoy experiencing life through my eyes for a time.'

<p>There are only 30 days left until my 30th birthday. These last few years of my 20’s have been a very trying time for me. I have dealt with loss in many forms. I lost a lover with whom I thought I would spend a majority of my life. I lost a mother who I never really knew. And most recently I lost my job in part due to medical circumstances beyond my control. Despite all of this, I try to live happily and freely, I continue to create and persevere and I am actually very happy right now in my life. Having experienced all of this loss has only brought clarity to me about what decisions I need to make in my life to make it bloom into everything it should be—everything I want it to be. Right now, I am being drawn toward creation. Many of you, if not all, know that I have written poetry all of my life. Poetry is my art, my outlet, the full expression of my internal being, but I have before now never treated it like anything more than a hobby. It’s no longer right for me to deny the fact that my form of creation needs to manifest into something tangible. It is for these reasons that I am asking for a very specific birthday gift this year. My wish-list involves giving you something in return. I want to self-publish a book of my own work. I have a working title right now, “Twelve Dozen Roses” and my book will include 144 pieces of my own original work. A very dear friend has offered to design my cover. I have come so close to making this dream of mine a reality but because I am surviving on a very tight budget right now, I need your help. I have created this Indiegogo campaign to help make the dreams of publishing my book and several copies of it a reality and it would mean so much to me if as a 30th birthday gift to me you would donate to my campaign and in turn, you would receive a book of my work. This is probably the most intimate way to get to know me, family and friends, and I want to share myself and my art with all of you who I love very much. </p>
<p>If you love poetry as art, I know you will not be disappointed in my work.</p>

<p>“Finding Starlight” is the true story of my life as told through the lens of a past-life regression session. My childhood was riddled with tragedy, abuse, and poverty; but this story is told from a magical, fantastical perspective. It begins at the crossroads of mental illness and spirituality and takes us beyond the farthest reaches of the universe – to when I was an actual star in the sky – to discover what is so special about being a human in the first place.</p>
<p>What does it mean - for all of us - that a person like me can grow up the way I did and still view the world as a magical place? It’s not about the ending; that, I’ve already given away. This is about the journey.</p>
<h3>“If it’s true that we choose certain aspects of our lives before we are born,” I muse early on in the book, “then why would I have chosen to be born into the life I had? Why would I willingly subject myself to the horror of my childhood – and my mother?”</h3>
<p>Anyone on the spiritual path (which is everyone, really, isn’t it?) has wondered if they’re crazy. We’ve wondered how we got here, what the hell we are doing, and why we even bother. Is there a deeper meaning behind the madness? Is madness even “real?” And how do we find our way through the weight of our own darkness?</p>
<p>I didn’t start out to answer these questions for anyone but myself. When the journey unfolded, though, I sensed it was about more than “just” me. I found that there was power in the asking, universal truth in the knowing, and humanity all along the way.</p>
<p>“Finding Starlight” is more than the story of my life. It’s about how we . . . become.</p>
<p>Read on for a synopsis, the story of how my past-life regression session became a manuscript, how I intend to get it into the hands of readers, and – at the very end – an excerpt from the current version.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554858665/wzxlfj8rdyf6wauq2xfz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>At the crossroads of mental illness &amp; spirituality, Brittany seeks answers. Though she fears her “darkness” will consume her, she finds the courage to delve deeply into her subconscious mind. In this fantastical (but true) journey, time is nonlinear. Villains are parents and vampires; heroes are witches and trees. A whimsical fairy leads a past-life regression session to help Brittany discover who she really is.</p>
<p>Her own life story unfolds from a magical perspective. Aided by an enchanted cloud, Brittany revisits her memories of trauma, abuse, and addiction. Through early childhood, into a disturbing adolescence, and beyond a crushing, life-changing manipulation, the odyssey of self-discovery intensifies.</p>
<p>Sanity is called into question after an explosion of sex, drugs, and self-loathing. In a pivotal moment of depravity, Brittany surrenders her freedom to the psychiatric ward, where she meets the first of many spiritual healers to inspire her to carry on. She follows her heart, and the sun, across the sea to the island-oasis of St. Croix, where her defenses begin to crumble.</p>
<p>An inexplicably magnetic affair at the end of her time in the Caribbean then launches Brittany into a series of past-lives beginning in eighteenth-century France. Alternate realities, spirit guides, and even the gods present themselves to offer profound healing and unbelievable insight. In an emotional crescendo, the question of sanity becomes irrelevant. She returns to wakefulness in the present time aware of her true celestial nature and unafraid of the dark.</p>

<p>My name is Brittany Boles, and I’ve been writing since I was nine years old. I finished the 80,000-word manuscript of “Finding Starlight” in the Spring of 2018, after a series of test-reads and edits.</p>
<p>The creative process was cathartic and healing: a ritual in forgiveness and acceptance. Writing it changed me, and I know reading it will do the same for others.</p>
<p>One of the book’s first readers said:</p>
<h3>“’Empowered’ instantly jumps to mind, and behind it is, ‘healed,’ as if I too, have walked this journey of self-discovery, healing and triumph and remembered bits of my own story, my own light. It broke my heart in places and mended the pieces back together with light. I never felt hopeless, only deep compassion and empathy. A resolve to keep going. The book brought tears to my eyes.”</h3>
<p>This. This is why it matters. People need to remember what the world looks like through the lens of magic.</p>
<p>When did we stop believing in the impossible?</p>
<p>“Finding Starlight” is about ascension, about waking up and rising up to meet our own glorious potential. It’s a groundbreaking debut novel that challenges the way we think about reincarnation, soul-contracts, magic, consciousness, and the origin of humanity. Simply put, this is a movement.</p>
<p>I am a woman driven by intuition. I read the signs of the universe and walk the path wherever it leads. My path has led me to follow in the footsteps of self-published books like “The Celestine Prophecy,” “Fifty Shades of Grey,” and “Legally Blonde.” Self-publishing means I have creative control, which means I get to ensure that the story remains:</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">True,</h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Inspiring,</h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Magical, and</h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Authentic.</h3>
<p>This book is a huge part of my life purpose; and, it is the first of many that I will write as the foundation of a career revolving around inspiring, teaching, and helping others. Through writing, speaking, yoga, reiki, and the intuitive arts, I am dedicated to a life of service. I came here to help wake people up to their own potential, in my own way, by sharing the story of my own continuous awakening.</p>
<p>“A book is a dream you hold in your hand.” – Neil Gaiman</p>
<p>I’ve been literally dreaming this book since I was nine years old. Take my hand, and I will give you my dream.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554859037/kgs8s5zratnt0bsagzru.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Your contribution will make “Finding Starlight” accessible to the entire world.</h3>
<p>Self-publishing is an avenue to massive distribution, and we are taking every opportunity available. With your help, this book will be in libraries, bookstores, on Amazon, Kindle, iBooks, and even recorded, with special bonus features, in my own voice, as an audio book on Audible.</p>
<p>Specifically, I have chosen to work with a company called <a href=""http://www.lulu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lulu</a>, which, as the one of the oldest and most established self-publishing aggregates, has over 20-years of experience and a reputation for success.</p>
<p>I am requesting a total of $6,500 to cover the entire publishing process that any manuscript requires in order to become a great book:</p>
<p>$3,700 – thorough, professional content and copy editing</p>
<p>$2,400 – e-book and print layout, cover design, copyright, ISBN assignment, editorial assessment, e-book features for Amazon, Kindle, and Barnes &amp; Noble, and global distribution including print-on-demand for both hardcover and paperback editions</p>
<p>$400 - fees associated with this campaign</p>
<h3>In return for your generous support, I am offering a variety of “perks” at different giving levels! Donations in the following amounts will receive:</h3>
<p>$20 – your name in the acknowledgements at the end of the book for all the world to appreciate</p>
<p>$25 - a signed paperback copy of “Finding Starlight”</p>
<p>$40 –a high-quality print of the original cover art by intuitive artist Nic DePamphilis</p>
<p>$50 – an oracle card and a written intuitive message, from me, about your life purpose</p>
<p>$100 – a signed hardcover copy of “Finding Starlight”</p>
<p>$250 – an original poem, handwritten for you by me</p>
<p>What will happen if I don’t raise all $6,500 over the next sixty days, you ask? A couple things. First, I’ll keep moving forward. Once I hit that $3,700 mark, I will start the editing process. Then, I’ll work really really hard to make the extra money I need to publish, no matter how long it takes! Indiegogo is cool enough to let us try again, for another sixty days, so if I’m close and feeling inspired, you might see me around again.</p>
<p>And if I raise MORE than $6,500 (yippeeeeeeee!), I will put it toward recording and distributing the audio book (another $500-$2500), PRINTING more books and GIVING them to libraries and schools, marketing the published works (we all know that can get spendy), and starting the sequel.</p>
<p>These are “stretch goals” now, but certainly on the horizon as soon and as earnestly as I can manage.</p>

<p>If you’ve been watching my journey, you know I have a heart and mind for big projects.</p>
<p>I co-founded and directed the nonprofit RAIN, completing a massive clean water + art + community re-empowerment project on the remote island of Ti Palmiste in Haiti. I’ve inspired and connected hundreds of students in local schools first through RAIN and then as a yoga teacher. I opened the beautiful Magical Yoga studio in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, where I personally touched and taught over a thousand people.</p>
<h3>As a reiki master and intuitive, I have helped countless people understand and heal from their traumas and discover their own light.</h3>
<p>I show up for my community as a volunteer, in women’s groups, as a friend, and as a community organizer (the Taste of Winnipesaukee, the RAIN Dance, and the Wolfeboro Arts Festival, for example).</p>
<p>I don’t know how to dream small, and I don’t believe in failing . . . only in learning how to be better.</p>
<p>Publishing this book is the first step toward taking my ideas to a global audience. Once it's ""out there,"" I will tour the philosophy at speaking engagements, in schools, in the press (hello, Ellen!), on social media, at yoga studios, at music and art festivals, and wherever else people want to be inspired to shine. It's another pillar in a career of empowerment, another way to talk about mental illness and spirituality, and a new language of human connection.</p>
<p>“Finding Starlight” has been a massive undertaking. Already, a dozen people have read and critiqued the manuscript. I’ve edited it half that many times. The book spans hundreds, if not thousands, of years of time and space, unearths stories that are guaranteed to get me into … uncomfortable situations … and unabashedly declares reality a permeable construct. It’s big.</p>
<h3>It’s like if Paulo Cohelo’s “The Alchemist” was true. What would that mean for the world?</h3>
<p>Let’s find out together. YOU have the power to change the language of spirituality, to spark a wildfire of inspiration that touches the non-believers, the too-big-believers, the bohemian idealists, and the am-I-really-this-crazies.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554859566/jbfmgdt2ttxn4swmnecx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I’ve already faced rejection. In the year since “Finding Starlight” has been “finished,” I have submitted queries to eighteen literary agencies, nine of which have outright rejected me (the other nine just never responded – ouch). My biggest challenge was getting published.</p>
<p>And, together, we are overcoming that hurdle. The “industry” doesn’t get it, and they are changing. Self-published books account for about 40% of the market today! I’m not a super-famous guru, I don’t have a reality TV show, and I didn’t go to an impressive college. I’m “nobody” to them.</p>
<h3>I’m just a human, who used to be a star, that wants you to read my story in hopes that you might remember what kind of human you can be, too.</h3>
<p>The biggest risk I have today is owning my story. There’s a lot of sensitive material between the pages, and I am certain some of the “characters” in it are not going to be pleased about my honesty. I’ve grappled with how important it is to share these details and how to respond when and if they are challenged.</p>
<p>Maybe that will be in Book Two.</p>
<p>Fear has never stopped me before, nor has poverty, shame, or rejection. The fact that I am alive today, and healthy, is evidence of my resilience. My desire to share it with you is proof of my courage.</p>
<p>Today, I ask you to believe in my story. Believe in the readers who came before you and the promise of the ones who will follow. Believe in the magic of new beginnings.</p>

<p>We sat and watched the beach in amiable silence. “May I wash your hair?” Paul suddenly asked. It was startling and strange and stirred something inside of me.</p>
<p>“I made this hair wash from the flower of a cactus that only grows on the eastern mountains,” he explained. “I hiked up there and harvested them under the light of the moon. They are powerful flowers, and the wash I made from them will purify you.” He was earnest and intense. The air grew hotter.</p>
<p>“Purify you,” he had said. Not “purify your hair.” My friends had stopped talking and were now openly staring at the dreadlocked man sitting close to me, talking about magical flowers.</p>
<p>I couldn’t fight it. I was curious!</p>
<p>“You want to wash my hair right now?” I asked. Everything started to feel magical, like a dream.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said, and would not let me look away. My intuition flared inside of me, responding to what felt like the tide pulling at my heart.</p>
<p>“Let’s do it,” I said, before I could change my mind. I was ignoring the other voice inside my head saying, <i>don’t just wander off with some strange man!</i></p>
<p>I stood and walked down the beach, trailing just behind my mysterious friend. Past the open sands, tourists, and locals, we walked into a mangrove patch. I noticed a bucket of liquid on the beach next to an old stone wall that jutted into the sea.</p>
<p>Paul led me into the water and bent my head back, wetting my hair. He ran his fingers through, gently combing out the many tangles, until it felt like silk. His lips formed the words, “follow me” as he turned and walked toward the bucket of cactus-water.</p>
<p>At the tip of the beach, just where tiny waves were touching the sand, he met me with the hair wash. I kneeled before him. He cupped a handful of slippery, fragrant liquid and poured it over my head. I closed my eyes, feeling rather than seeing him walk in a circle around my body as he slowly, rhythmically, soaked my hair.</p>
<p>“Stand and face me,” he said. Now he looked more like an old and weathered shaman than a twenty-something white rasta.</p>
<p>“Do you know why I chose you?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No,” I said as the warmth of the sun dripped over my head in the silken fragrance of the wash.</p>
<p>“You were glowing. Not as brightly as you could have been, though!” he admonished. “I almost did not see your shine, in fact. There were others who seemed much brighter. I walked past you once already, but you did not notice me either.</p>
<p>“The great Jah, the Spirit in the Sky, made me turn around to see you. In that moment, as you smiled and laughed, a bright golden light burst around you. It only lasted for a second before fading into a glow, but it drew me to you nonetheless.” He had been speaking quickly and urgently, but now he stopped and peered through intense eyes at something that was me but was not my body.</p>
<p>“Now that you have been soaked with this wash, the magic of the flower will purify your spirit. You are already shining now more brightly than anyone I have ever seen. You will walk along the beach touching both sea and earth. Walk in your own light. Walk until you feel and see what I see now. Others may notice your brilliance; ignore them and continue walking. You will know then to find me.”</p>
<p>I was under his spell, which felt amazingly calm and expansive. I turned and walked as he had said. I did feel lighter, like I was floating rather than walking. Each pebble of sand seemed to be a different, equally vivid color, and the sound of the waves was like fairy breaths.</p>
<p>The warmth of the sun encased my body, reflecting both from the clear blue water and the peak of the sky. I turned and closed my eyes, facing the bright white light and breathing a long, deep, satisfying breath. I spread my arms wide and embraced the sky, feeling a golden light within my chest leap forth to meet the sunlight.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and saw, indeed, a brilliant sheen surrounding everything. I could look at nothing directly; my eyes glowed from within and every tree, person, rock, and wave had the quality of a mirage.</p>
<p>Following my instincts, a delicate pull like butterfly to flower, I arrived again at the clearing in the mangrove trees and Rasta Paul, sitting cross-legged on the sand, waiting for me.</p>
<p>He stood and led me wordlessly back into the water until my feet no longer touched the sea floor. He supported my body and bent my head backward, submerging me and lifting me in the same motion so that my hair streamed away from my eyes and our faces were inches apart just above the surface.</p>
<p>“You are a Queen, but you do not act as a Queen should,” he said, dunking me again. “You are loose, going through your life totally unaware of everything around you! You run around with all sorts of worthless men, demanding from them nothing, giving yourself away.” Once more, I was under, and then back up. “I see you, with a beautiful smile on your face and wise eyes blurred and closed to the world around you.” He was speaking harshly, like he was angry with me. His grip on my arm got firmer so that he was both supporting me and drawing me closer.</p>
<p>The water seemed to ripple with heat, and a flicker of fear ran through me.</p>
<p>In one powerful, hard motion, he pulled my back into his chest so close that his head was over my shoulder, next to my ear. “Do not give yourself away to these people,” he growled. He turned so that we were facing the crowded beach. ‘These people’ meant a lot more than just the lovers I had taken.</p>
<p>“Today, I see that you are not that woman I saw before. You truly are a Queen, and you have been washed clean so that your light can shine brightly forth!” He roughly pushed away from me then, swimming back to the beach, where he began to fuss with rocks and a stump, building a makeshift chair.</p>
<p>I took a few deep breaths, steadying myself.</p>
<p>A little bit afraid, I was nonetheless still caught in his spell and curious about what would happen next. I swam back to the shore. He gestured for me to sit. I closed my eyes and sat. He again began to run his fingers through my hair, combing out the long, sun-kissed locks. Silent music seemed to play, capturing the two of us in a smooth vibrational rhythm.</p>
<p>I peeked through lowered eyelids to see that he was now moving farther from me, circling my body and combing out invisible threads as though they flowed from my stomach. I closed my eyes once more and saw brilliant golden strands of light streaming through his fingers. He wove, combed, and stroked a thousand individual strands away from my body in every direction until I was encased in a sphere of shining threads.</p>
<p>When he was finished, he sat cross-legged on the sand watching me. For a few moments, I stayed still and silent with my eyes closed, enjoying the image of the golden strands of energy. Then, I opened them and looked directly into Paul’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said.</p>
</div><p>“You will not forget me,” he replied. “And I expect you will not forget to honor yourself as Queen, either.”</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554860250/gpkgvi3yzhkm4urcboll.png"" src=""""/></p></div>","“Finding Starlight” is the true story of my life as told through the lens of a past-life regression session. My childhood was riddled with tragedy, abuse, and poverty; but this story is told from a magical, fantastical perspective. It begins at the crossroads of mental illness and spirituality and takes us beyond the farthest reaches of the universe – to when I was an actual star in the sky – to discover what is so special about being a human in the first place.
What does it mean - for all of us - that a person like me can grow up the way I did and still view the world as a magical place? It’s not about the ending; that, I’ve already given away. This is about the journey.
“If it’s true that we choose certain aspects of our lives before we are born,” I muse early on in the book, “then why would I have chosen to be born into the life I had? Why would I willingly subject myself to the horror of my childhood – and my mother?”
Anyone on the spiritual path (which is everyone, really, isn’t it?) has wondered if they’re crazy. We’ve wondered how we got here, what the hell we are doing, and why we even bother. Is there a deeper meaning behind the madness? Is madness even “real?” And how do we find our way through the weight of our own darkness?
I didn’t start out to answer these questions for anyone but myself. When the journey unfolded, though, I sensed it was about more than “just” me. I found that there was power in the asking, universal truth in the knowing, and humanity all along the way.
“Finding Starlight” is more than the story of my life. It’s about how we . . . become.
Read on for a synopsis, the story of how my past-life regression session became a manuscript, how I intend to get it into the hands of readers, and – at the very end – an excerpt from the current version.

At the crossroads of mental illness & spirituality, Brittany seeks answers. Though she fears her “darkness” will consume her, she finds the courage to delve deeply into her subconscious mind. In this fantastical (but true) journey, time is nonlinear. Villains are parents and vampires; heroes are witches and trees. A whimsical fairy leads a past-life regression session to help Brittany discover who she really is.
Her own life story unfolds from a magical perspective. Aided by an enchanted cloud, Brittany revisits her memories of trauma, abuse, and addiction. Through early childhood, into a disturbing adolescence, and beyond a crushing, life-changing manipulation, the odyssey of self-discovery intensifies.
Sanity is called into question after an explosion of sex, drugs, and self-loathing. In a pivotal moment of depravity, Brittany surrenders her freedom to the psychiatric ward, where she meets the first of many spiritual healers to inspire her to carry on. She follows her heart, and the sun, across the sea to the island-oasis of St. Croix, where her defenses begin to crumble.
An inexplicably magnetic affair at the end of her time in the Caribbean then launches Brittany into a series of past-lives beginning in eighteenth-century France. Alternate realities, spirit guides, and even the gods present themselves to offer profound healing and unbelievable insight. In an emotional crescendo, the question of sanity becomes irrelevant. She returns to wakefulness in the present time aware of her true celestial nature and unafraid of the dark.

My name is Brittany Boles, and I’ve been writing since I was nine years old. I finished the 80,000-word manuscript of “Finding Starlight” in the Spring of 2018, after a series of test-reads and edits.
The creative process was cathartic and healing: a ritual in forgiveness and acceptance. Writing it changed me, and I know reading it will do the same for others.
One of the book’s first readers said:
“’Empowered’ instantly jumps to mind, and behind it is, ‘healed,’ as if I too, have walked this journey of self-discovery, healing and triumph and remembered bits of my own story, my own light. It broke my heart in places and mended the pieces back together with light. I never felt hopeless, only deep compassion and empathy. A resolve to keep going. The book brought tears to my eyes.”
This. This is why it matters. People need to remember what the world looks like through the lens of magic.
When did we stop believing in the impossible?
“Finding Starlight” is about ascension, about waking up and rising up to meet our own glorious potential. It’s a groundbreaking debut novel that challenges the way we think about reincarnation, soul-contracts, magic, consciousness, and the origin of humanity. Simply put, this is a movement.
I am a woman driven by intuition. I read the signs of the universe and walk the path wherever it leads. My path has led me to follow in the footsteps of self-published books like “The Celestine Prophecy,” “Fifty Shades of Grey,” and “Legally Blonde.” Self-publishing means I have creative control, which means I get to ensure that the story remains:
True,
Inspiring,
Magical, and
Authentic.
This book is a huge part of my life purpose; and, it is the first of many that I will write as the foundation of a career revolving around inspiring, teaching, and helping others. Through writing, speaking, yoga, reiki, and the intuitive arts, I am dedicated to a life of service. I came here to help wake people up to their own potential, in my own way, by sharing the story of my own continuous awakening.
“A book is a dream you hold in your hand.” – Neil Gaiman
I’ve been literally dreaming this book since I was nine years old. Take my hand, and I will give you my dream.

Your contribution will make “Finding Starlight” accessible to the entire world.
Self-publishing is an avenue to massive distribution, and we are taking every opportunity available. With your help, this book will be in libraries, bookstores, on Amazon, Kindle, iBooks, and even recorded, with special bonus features, in my own voice, as an audio book on Audible.
Specifically, I have chosen to work with a company called Lulu, which, as the one of the oldest and most established self-publishing aggregates, has over 20-years of experience and a reputation for success.
I am requesting a total of $6,500 to cover the entire publishing process that any manuscript requires in order to become a great book:
$3,700 – thorough, professional content and copy editing
$2,400 – e-book and print layout, cover design, copyright, ISBN assignment, editorial assessment, e-book features for Amazon, Kindle, and Barnes & Noble, and global distribution including print-on-demand for both hardcover and paperback editions
$400 - fees associated with this campaign
In return for your generous support, I am offering a variety of “perks” at different giving levels! Donations in the following amounts will receive:
$20 – your name in the acknowledgements at the end of the book for all the world to appreciate
$25 - a signed paperback copy of “Finding Starlight”
$40 –a high-quality print of the original cover art by intuitive artist Nic DePamphilis
$50 – an oracle card and a written intuitive message, from me, about your life purpose
$100 – a signed hardcover copy of “Finding Starlight”
$250 – an original poem, handwritten for you by me
What will happen if I don’t raise all $6,500 over the next sixty days, you ask? A couple things. First, I’ll keep moving forward. Once I hit that $3,700 mark, I will start the editing process. Then, I’ll work really really hard to make the extra money I need to publish, no matter how long it takes! Indiegogo is cool enough to let us try again, for another sixty days, so if I’m close and feeling inspired, you might see me around again.
And if I raise MORE than $6,500 (yippeeeeeeee!), I will put it toward recording and distributing the audio book (another $500-$2500), PRINTING more books and GIVING them to libraries and schools, marketing the published works (we all know that can get spendy), and starting the sequel.
These are “stretch goals” now, but certainly on the horizon as soon and as earnestly as I can manage.

If you’ve been watching my journey, you know I have a heart and mind for big projects.
I co-founded and directed the nonprofit RAIN, completing a massive clean water + art + community re-empowerment project on the remote island of Ti Palmiste in Haiti. I’ve inspired and connected hundreds of students in local schools first through RAIN and then as a yoga teacher. I opened the beautiful Magical Yoga studio in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, where I personally touched and taught over a thousand people.
As a reiki master and intuitive, I have helped countless people understand and heal from their traumas and discover their own light.
I show up for my community as a volunteer, in women’s groups, as a friend, and as a community organizer (the Taste of Winnipesaukee, the RAIN Dance, and the Wolfeboro Arts Festival, for example).
I don’t know how to dream small, and I don’t believe in failing . . . only in learning how to be better.
Publishing this book is the first step toward taking my ideas to a global audience. Once it's ""out there,"" I will tour the philosophy at speaking engagements, in schools, in the press (hello, Ellen!), on social media, at yoga studios, at music and art festivals, and wherever else people want to be inspired to shine. It's another pillar in a career of empowerment, another way to talk about mental illness and spirituality, and a new language of human connection.
“Finding Starlight” has been a massive undertaking. Already, a dozen people have read and critiqued the manuscript. I’ve edited it half that many times. The book spans hundreds, if not thousands, of years of time and space, unearths stories that are guaranteed to get me into … uncomfortable situations … and unabashedly declares reality a permeable construct. It’s big.
It’s like if Paulo Cohelo’s “The Alchemist” was true. What would that mean for the world?
Let’s find out together. YOU have the power to change the language of spirituality, to spark a wildfire of inspiration that touches the non-believers, the too-big-believers, the bohemian idealists, and the am-I-really-this-crazies.

I’ve already faced rejection. In the year since “Finding Starlight” has been “finished,” I have submitted queries to eighteen literary agencies, nine of which have outright rejected me (the other nine just never responded – ouch). My biggest challenge was getting published.
And, together, we are overcoming that hurdle. The “industry” doesn’t get it, and they are changing. Self-published books account for about 40% of the market today! I’m not a super-famous guru, I don’t have a reality TV show, and I didn’t go to an impressive college. I’m “nobody” to them.
I’m just a human, who used to be a star, that wants you to read my story in hopes that you might remember what kind of human you can be, too.
The biggest risk I have today is owning my story. There’s a lot of sensitive material between the pages, and I am certain some of the “characters” in it are not going to be pleased about my honesty. I’ve grappled with how important it is to share these details and how to respond when and if they are challenged.
Maybe that will be in Book Two.
Fear has never stopped me before, nor has poverty, shame, or rejection. The fact that I am alive today, and healthy, is evidence of my resilience. My desire to share it with you is proof of my courage.
Today, I ask you to believe in my story. Believe in the readers who came before you and the promise of the ones who will follow. Believe in the magic of new beginnings.
“I continue to be amazed at what humans can endure and still be kind and loving and desirous of evolution of self. It’s easy to say, “fuck it” but so many times people do not, and you did not.”

 About the Editor
My name is Michael S. Alter, and I am a life-long sci-fi fan.  I grew up reading Asimov's and Analog, Heinlein and Clarke.  I love the stories, although editing errors would always throw me.A few years back I started writing my own stories, and then decided to try my hand at publishing.  I launched issue #1 with several key ideas in mind:No form letters to authors submitting a story.  I'll always give you at least some personalized feedback.Sharing the profits with the authors.  All authors receive a share of the proceeds according to a formula.Authors retain the rights to their work, even after my edits.  I only keep the right to continue publishing the story as part of the issue of the magazine.Low-priced, high-quality stories, lucky 13 per issue.  I'm a strong editor, I'll work with my authors to put out only the best stories.  I have additional reviewers/editors keeping me honest, too.  (Thanks again to Louise Sorensen!)I'm not trying to make big money out of this, only enough to take my wife out for a nice dinner! ;-) 
What you get
Sci-fi!  It'll make you think, and maybe open your eyes a little to the future coming at us.  There'll be 13 (unless I miscount!) sci-fi stories, maybe 30,000 to 50,000 words total, plus an article from the editor (that's me!) about the future in the real world. 
Risks & ChallengesNo risks at all.  I already have a number of good stories. Submitting a StoryIf you'd like to submit a story for this or future issues, send it (as text in the body of the email, please!) to:michael.s.alter.author@gmail.comRules for submission:4,000 words or less (I'm not super-strict about that one)PG-13 or tamer (a bit more strict on that account, but there is a gray area)Has to be a work where you own all the rightsScience fiction, or maybe tales of the weird.  No swords and sorcery, please!  Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:Post about the campaign on Twitter......or Facebook...or any other social media platform...or just tell your friends about it!Thanks again for checking out our campaign!",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<p><a href=""http://sistories.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SISTORIES LITMAG</a> is our humble attempt at contributing to the body politic Tressie McMillian Cottom speaks of in the aforementioned quote. </p>
<p>We are centering the stories of Southern Black women/femmes, specifically those in and from Charlotte, NC, by publishing their work in print and digitally.  We aim to continue the tradition that has led our foremothers into self-awareness, power, and freedom, by providing a platform for Black women/femmes to read, share, and reflect on the stories that bind us</p>
<p>Our magazine is interactive, meaning we’re working with Black women scholars from Charlotte to develop a curriculum around the themes in the fiction, nonfiction, poetry, photography, and visual art submissions featured in the first issue. The curriculum will include writing prompts, reflection questions, and reading guides.</p>
<p>Using the magazine, we’ll be hosting community workshops that nurture the creative and holistic spirits of Black women. The intent is to cultivate a space that supports deep analysis of self through story, while also exploring the historical, political, social, and economic factors that influence Black women's lives. </p>

<h3><strong>The Why</strong></h3>
<p>We believe Black feminism is a powerful political framework to achieve individual and collective freedom. We know that we can consistently look to the stories of Southern Black women and femmes to develop practices of equity and freedom.

<p>I started SISTORIES in 2018 after a deep dive into Black women’s history turned into a deep dive of self, which ultimately led to personal liberation. It was prompted by the release of Candice Benbow’s <a href=""https://issuu.com/candicebenbow/docs/lemonade_syllabus_2016"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lemonade Syllabus</a> in 2016  when I realized how few of the works I’d neither heard of or read despite my English degree and teaching credentials. </p>
<p>When I began that journey, I saw for the first time how connected my life was to all the Black women’s lives who had come before me.

Short Summary
SISTORIES LITMAG is our humble attempt at contributing to the body politic Tressie McMillian Cottom speaks of in the aforementioned quote.

What We Need

We’ve already been awarded a Cultural Vision Grant from the ASC towards printing and distributing 400 copies of SISTORIES LITMAG, but we're expected to match those grant funds, and we also believe that Black women/femmes deserve to be paid for their work, so in order to bring this project completion we’ll need to raise a bit more money.

<h3>Résumé du projet</h3>
<p>Bonjour, ici Philippe Cigna, membre du duo légendaire Sèxe Illégal et du podcast Tu Me Niaises. Soyons honnêtes, je n’ai pas réellement besoin de votre aide pour écrire un livre, je peux m’en charger tout seul. Par contre, j’ai définitivement besoin de votre aide pour rembourser mes dettes et m’éviter la faillite (again).</p>
<p>Pour la modeste somme de 10$, vous avez la chance de participer à ma libération du joug de l’État, en plus de recevoir un recueil de nouvelles que je suis en train d’écrire. Si je réussis à atteindre mon objectif, je pourrai enfin dormir tranquille et commencer à m’acheter des choses le fun (comme une machine à crème glacée et un chapeau de cow-boy) ET EN PLUS j’aurai écrit un livre. Tout ça grâce à vous. </p>
<p>Finalement, j’aimerais remercier JF et Mathieu de croire en moi (et vous) et de me pousser à chercher des solutions au lieu de noyer ma peine en écoutant Véro et les Fantastiques. Je vous souhaite tous d’avoir des amis aussi gentils. <br/> </p>

<p>Moon Tide Press is an independent publisher located in Southern California established in 2006. Eric Morago in 2017 took over the press and made a commitment to expand its focus on new, diverse, and daring voices—voices that can often be overlooked, but shouldn’t. </p>
<p>Eric continued Moon Tide’s tradition of publishing poetry anthologies but began concentrating on more themed content beginning with its <i>Dark Ink: A Poetry Anthology Inspired by Horror</i> in 2018. </p>
<p>Following the success of that release, Eric wondered what Moon Tide’s next themed anthology should be. One day, when Moon Tide author Dania Alkhouli remarked during the reading of one of her poems that she could write a book dedicated to all the sh!t men have said to her, folks in the audience chimed in that <i>that</i> should be the next anthology. It didn't really take any convincing.</p>

<p><strong><i>Sh!t Men Say to Me: A Poetry Anthology in Response to Toxic Masculinity</i></strong> features the work of over 70 poets from across the country (and some even beyond it) who have all been struck by the sharp tongue of toxic masculinity, and have something necessary to say about it. Poets of different backgrounds, genders, sexualities, creeds, and colors unpack deeply personal stories about weaponized power, engrained misogyny  and finding your complete personhood in a system that tries to make you less.</p>
<p>This is their book. </p>
<p>We believe in the importance of this collection and want to see it in the hands of as many people as possible; however, due to the pandemic keeping us from safely doing in-person events where we could promote and sell copies of the book thus recouping the upfront publishing expenses, we are looking for other avenues to ensure the book’s overall success and print run.</p>
<p>We also just wanted to reach out to our community in a fun and interactive way. </p>
<p>The moneys we raise through this crowdfunding effort will go towards the design and production cost of the book, including printing and shipping contributor copies to each of the poets published in it.

<p>As a way to show our gratitude we have come up with some exciting and unique rewards for those who support our campaign to raise the funds we need. Besides getting a copy of the anthology at every tier level of support, you can also enjoy perks like curated literary-themed gift boxes, enrollment in master class workshops facilitated by the anthologies three editors, one-on-one manuscript consultation with Moon Tide Editor-in-Chief, original art, and much more!

</div></div>","Moon Tide Press is an independent publisher located in Southern California established in 2006. Eric Morago in 2017 took over the press and made a commitment to expand its focus on new, diverse, and daring voices—voices that can often be overlooked, but shouldn’t. 
Eric continued Moon Tide’s tradition of publishing poetry anthologies but began concentrating on more themed content beginning with its Dark Ink: A Poetry Anthology Inspired by Horror in 2018. 
Following the success of that release, Eric wondered what Moon Tide’s next themed anthology should be. One day, when Moon Tide author Dania Alkhouli remarked during the reading of one of her poems that she could write a book dedicated to all the sh!t men have said to her, folks in the audience chimed in that that should be the next anthology. It didn't really take any convincing.
Dania may have meant for what she said to be a humorous aside, but the truth of the matter is that it really isn’t funny, and it needs to be responded to.

and Life of Female Entrepreneurs: A Book About Relationships and Success in the
Time of Millennials </u></b></h2><div><b><u><br/></u></b></div>
<p><i><b>In the
midst of pursuing the most difficult journey I’ve ever embarked on, I had my
heart ripped out and trampled on</b>.</i> I picked it up, put it back where it
belonged, and then continued on with the feeling of a thousand knives stabbing
into it. I thought that breaking up with him would heal the pain I
felt, but all it did was worsen it. </p>
<p><i>I lost the man I loved, my best
friend, and my favorite advisor. </i></p>
<p>Despite
the agony, I still had to suit up and show up to continue building my very
first startup. For the first time in my life, I had more than just my own
wellbeing at stake. My decisions impacted the livelihood of an entire company,
and more than just my own future. </p>
<p>How did
other women do it? Is it even possible to be successful in a romantic
relationship while running a business? I wondered if Sarah Blakely went through
heartbreak while she started SPANX. I wondered if Melinda Gates ever had
problems with Bill, and how she handled them. Building a company required me to
be leader-like, single-focused, and decisive, whereas, building a romantic
relationship required me to be receptive, adaptable, and multi-focused. I
wondered how many other women dealt with these opposing demands? So, I started
asking around my own network of high-powered women, and found that many of them
are facing similar challenges…</p><p><br/></p>

elephant in the room.</span>
</h2><p><br/></p>
<h3>This is why I will
be spending the next 6-12 months interviewing entrepreneurial women from all
walks of life, to reveal their stories, their challenges, their successes, and
their opinions about love and relationships in the world of a female entrepreneur
in the 21st century. Then, I will compile them into a book: <b><i><u>The
Love and Life of Female Entrepreneurs</u></i></b>*</h3><div><br/></div>
<p></p>
<p>The idea came to me
when I attended an event where there was a panel of two entrepreneurs talking
about their businesses and lives as female entrepreneurs. I noticed that
neither of them talked about their romantic relationships, so, when the Q&amp;A
was opened up to the audience, I asked “<i>How did starting your businesses impact
your personal relationships?</i>” Clearly, this made them feel uncomfortable, and the
tone of the entire room shifted. I couldn’t believe how taboo the subject was.
After the panel, I had a series of women thank me for asking them that
question. It became clear that there’s a need for these topics to be talked
about more freely.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>In this book, we’ll be tackling some questions like…</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>What kind of
challenges do women face in their relationships and dating lives, while
starting a business?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>With more women starting companies, how
are we dealing with this shift of gender roles in our relationships?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>How do relationship
disasters, such as divorce and adultery, affect our businesses?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>How do successful
business owners cope with emotional pain?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>What do female
entrepreneurs think about alternative relationship styles, like polyamory?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>What, if anything,
can we do to ensure success in both our relationships AND our businesses?</i></b></p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>
<p>As a<b> Certified Relationship Coach</b> and <b>Sexuality Educator</b>, romantic
relationships are always on my mind. As I meet more and more successful
entrepreneurs, I’m learning how taboo it is to talk about personal
relationships. Being a millennial female entrepreneur is hard enough, but tack
on some trouble with a husband, boyfriend or dating life, and it’s a whirlwind
of impact. </p><p><b><i>As women, we have an obligation to band together and provide
concrete stories and information for other female entrepreneurs who may be going
through similar struggles, in order to set up future female entrepreneurs for
success in all of their relationships. This information could also be useful to
men that are dating female entrepreneurs (or want to), as well as the people
that work around them.</i></b></p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>

<p>As many of you know, I am on this incredible journey in the
startup world. I've founded a tech startup, called The Panty Drawer, and I have
never been more fulfilled in my life! </p>
<p>At this point in my
journey, I have worked long and hard to bring together a team of 4 incredible
people, create a product that fulfills a need, build a plan of execution, and
found a way to use this as a vehicle to give back and empower women.</p>
<p>By selling copies of this book now, I will be
able to dedicate enough time and energy into The Panty Drawer, while writing
this book, to keep it moving forward while we still have momentum!</p>
<p>Please help me help women around the world. Your contribution will
impact all the female entrepreneurs that will be interviewed in this book, all
the readers that find inspiration of this book, all the women that will
eventually be treated and pampered with our panty boxes, all the women and
children that The Panty Drawer will be donating to, as well as this woman right
here, by allowing me to freely pursue my dream.</p>

<p></p></div>","Love
and Life of Female Entrepreneurs: A Book About Relationships and Success in the
Time of Millennials 
In the
midst of pursuing the most difficult journey I’ve ever embarked on, I had my
heart ripped out and trampled on. I picked it up, put it back where it
belonged, and then continued on with the feeling of a thousand knives stabbing
into it. I thought that breaking up with him would heal the pain I
felt, but all it did was worsen it. 
I lost the man I loved, my best
friend, and my favorite advisor. 
Despite
the agony, I still had to suit up and show up to continue building my very
first startup. For the first time in my life, I had more than just my own
wellbeing at stake. My decisions impacted the livelihood of an entire company,
and more than just my own future. 
How did
other women do it? Is it even possible to be successful in a romantic
relationship while running a business? I wondered if Sarah Blakely went through
heartbreak while she started SPANX. I wondered if Melinda Gates ever had
problems with Bill, and how she handled them. Building a company required me to
be leader-like, single-focused, and decisive, whereas, building a romantic
relationship required me to be receptive, adaptable, and multi-focused. I
wondered how many other women dealt with these opposing demands? So, I started
asking around my own network of high-powered women, and found that many of them
are facing similar challenges…
In an article titled Female Entrepreneurs Are Happier Than Male Entrepreneurs, Forbes
wrote:
“Maria Seidman, CEO of simple app-maker, Yapp, says
she’s definitely more fulfilled as an entrepreneur. Of course, there are
trade-offs. “There is a lot of uncertainty and failures in the day to day,
in addition to the successes and wins, and the emotional roller-coaster can
take a toll on you and your relationships if not managed,” she says.
“Entrepreneurship can also be lonely – even if you have a great partner, team,
and mentors – because ultimately the buck stops with you and some days you
really feel the weight of that responsibility to make it all work.”
---An article on Inc.com said:
“Wendi Goldsmith, the CEO of Bioengineering Group, in
Salem, Massachusetts, didn't get a single bite when she tried online dating
after her divorce in 2003. Then she made one change to her profile, and the
responses streamed in.
The one change? She stopped referring to herself as an
entrepreneur.”---
In the article called 6 Challenges Women Entrepreneurs Face, Businessnewsdaily.com wrote:
“Entrepreneurship was once considered a man's
territory, but each year, more and more women set out on the journey to launch
and lead their own companies. “---

With more and more
women entering the entrepreneurial world, we’re seeing a shift from women
competing with each other, to supporting one another. Networking events have
shifted from a “what can you do for me?” to a “what can I do for you?” mentality, but with our personal lives and relationships still taboo, there’s a major
elephant in the room.

This is why I will
be spending the next 6-12 months interviewing entrepreneurial women from all
walks of life, to reveal their stories, their challenges, their successes, and
their opinions about love and relationships in the world of a female entrepreneur
in the 21st century. Then, I will compile them into a book: The
Love and Life of Female Entrepreneurs*

The idea came to me
when I attended an event where there was a panel of two entrepreneurs talking
about their businesses and lives as female entrepreneurs. I noticed that
neither of them talked about their romantic relationships, so, when the Q&A
was opened up to the audience, I asked “How did starting your businesses impact
your personal relationships?” Clearly, this made them feel uncomfortable, and the
tone of the entire room shifted. I couldn’t believe how taboo the subject was.
After the panel, I had a series of women thank me for asking them that
question. It became clear that there’s a need for these topics to be talked
about more freely.

In this book, we’ll be tackling some questions like…

What kind of
challenges do women face in their relationships and dating lives, while
starting a business?
With more women starting companies, how
are we dealing with this shift of gender roles in our relationships?
How do relationship
disasters, such as divorce and adultery, affect our businesses?
How do successful
business owners cope with emotional pain?
What do female
entrepreneurs think about alternative relationship styles, like polyamory?
What, if anything,
can we do to ensure success in both our relationships AND our businesses?
As a Certified Relationship Coach and Sexuality Educator, romantic
relationships are always on my mind. As I meet more and more successful
entrepreneurs, I’m learning how taboo it is to talk about personal
relationships. Being a millennial female entrepreneur is hard enough, but tack
on some trouble with a husband, boyfriend or dating life, and it’s a whirlwind
of impact. As women, we have an obligation to band together and provide
concrete stories and information for other female entrepreneurs who may be going
through similar struggles, in order to set up future female entrepreneurs for
success in all of their relationships. This information could also be useful to
men that are dating female entrepreneurs (or want to), as well as the people
that work around them.
---Who's Being Interviewed---Here's a list of Entrepreneurial Women who I have already interviewed, or has already agreed to be interviewed:Chantelle Baxter, Co-founder of One Girl, Speaker, & Blogger (author of this incredibly inspiring blog post: ""7 Surprising Lessons I Learnt From My Recent Breakup"" )  Pocket Sun, Founder of SoGal: a platform, and community, for millennial female entrepreneurs, on a mission to close the gender gap in entrepreneurship

This book will be
published through Amazon, and print copies will be available! It will also be available as an ebook!
Once $20K is

I will include
interviews from the people (men and women) who are dating female entrepreneurs,

environments

A note from the
author…
As many of you know, I am on this incredible journey in the
startup world. I've founded a tech startup, called The Panty Drawer, and I have
never been more fulfilled in my life! 
At this point in my
journey, I have worked long and hard to bring together a team of 4 incredible
people, create a product that fulfills a need, build a plan of execution, and
found a way to use this as a vehicle to give back and empower women.
By selling copies of this book now, I will be
able to dedicate enough time and energy into The Panty Drawer, while writing
this book, to keep it moving forward while we still have momentum!
Please help me help women around the world. Your contribution will
impact all the female entrepreneurs that will be interviewed in this book, all
the readers that find inspiration of this book, all the women that will
eventually be treated and pampered with our panty boxes, all the women and
children that The Panty Drawer will be donating to, as well as this woman right
here, by allowing me to freely pursue my dream.

away from my hair and my head. My short pants slid down to my knees. I used one

<h2></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">  Why The Campaign </h2>
<p>I believe in family. I wanted to do something unique and make my family proud, so I wrote a book focusing on a brother's bond. </p>
<p>A family's bond is strong - stronger than anything. A father protecting his daughter, a mother caring for her young, a brother standing up for his sibling, and a sister advising her's. Protection, care, wisdom, and love. That's what makes up a family and that's what makes the bond so powerful. Family is the most important aspect in life. </p>
<p>There are so many broken families nowadays, children who never got the opportunity to meet their father or mother. They feel alone in this great big world, they feel abandoned, forgotten. Which often pushes them away from the family they have and end up traveling down a dark, wicked path. </p>
<p>We all face challenges in life, but when we do face these challenges; it's our decision on what path we choose. Will we press on through the fog and reach our goal or turn back and give up? </p>
<p>Life is never simple enough to just choose a yes or no option, we often choose to take a leap of faith, but why not turn to family? They want what's best for you and they love you. They are the greatest guidance you can receive. </p>
<p>The world needs to know how strong a family's bond can be for one another and that no one is alone in this world. </p>

The year is 1204 - the 4th Crusade. Two brothers, Marcus and Alexander, uncover a myth in the depths of Constantinople. What seems like a mere coincidence develops into an all out war of good versus evil.
When Marcus is bitten by a monstrous creature and transforms into the beast itself, he is forced to flee. Since the bond between the brothers is so overpowering, Alexander will stop at nothing and risk everything in order to bring his brother back into the light.
A dark truth waits to be discovered regarding their father's death, and Marcus and Alexander become entangled in a battle of life or death. Once discovered, the secret will change their lives forever. 



  Why The Campaign 
I believe in family. I wanted to do something unique and make my family proud, so I wrote a book focusing on a brother's bond. 
A family's bond is strong - stronger than anything. A father protecting his daughter, a mother caring for her young, a brother standing up for his sibling, and a sister advising her's. Protection, care, wisdom, and love. That's what makes up a family and that's what makes the bond so powerful. Family is the most important aspect in life. 
There are so many broken families nowadays, children who never got the opportunity to meet their father or mother. They feel alone in this great big world, they feel abandoned, forgotten. Which often pushes them away from the family they have and end up traveling down a dark, wicked path. 
We all face challenges in life, but when we do face these challenges; it's our decision on what path we choose. Will we press on through the fog and reach our goal or turn back and give up? 
Life is never simple enough to just choose a yes or no option, we often choose to take a leap of faith, but why not turn to family? They want what's best for you and they love you. They are the greatest guidance you can receive. 
The world needs to know how strong a family's bond can be for one another and that no one is alone in this world. 




Meet the Author
Hi, I'm Tim Routledge. I'm an author from Chicago, Illinois and I've spent a lot of my life traveling to new places. I've been all around the country - I love learning the history of each new place I visit, as well as enjoying the scenery. I'm 22 years old and I love writing stories. Stories full of exciting action between heroes and villains. The classic good versus evil. Immortal is a new and engaging story that focuses on relationships between likable characters having to endure trials which will either make or break them. I am very knowledgeable in history - world, U.S., mythology, etc.. With all my traveling and interest in history, I've created an imaginative new story where two brothers find that they have been living in a world where the supernatural exists.  This story is more than just another story. This story is about family. Two brothers, who had lost both parents, out on their own. These brothers are extremely close and will risk their lives for each other without hesitation. I based the main character's personality off my own: Alexander, the younger brother. There are also a few similarities between my brother and Alexander's brother, Marcus. But the brother's bond throughout the book is exactly like the bond I share with my brother. This isn't just another book. It's my life. At least it's my life if it took place in the 13th century and there were mythological creatures roaming about, but that's where my imagination kicks in.  
The GoalThe goal is to raise enough money to have this book edited and published on kindle/ebook and softcover for the world to read. It would be a dream come true for me to see this book on the shelves.What Your Money Will Pay For$2,900 - Proofreading and line editing through CreateSpace (An Amazon.com Company)$300 - Published through CreateSpace as a softcover print and an ebook. I know my goal is set at $2,000, but after contacting CreateSpace - I've decided to go through them to have the book edited instead of the independent author through Fiverr.com. Total to have IMMORTAL published - $3,200. Excerpt From Immortal""I hesitate to aid any man in becoming immortal, because it is rare that it ends well."" Jal said this with an unmistakable bitterness in his tone.""Risk, pain, and daunting tasks I must go through to achieve immortality pale in comparison to what my brother would have to face alone the remainder of his days, Jal."" Alexander replied, confidently.

<p>My name is Stutisheel Lebedev, and I am a 9-time finisher of the world’s longest race - the  3100-Mile Self-Transcendence Race, that takes place annually in Queens, New York. For my best performance, it took me 48 days to complete the distance, averaging 64.3 miles per day. </p>
<p>I take it as a natural quality to share the best you have. My participation in the 3100-Mile Race changed my life dramatically - I saw and became aware of many things that block or delay the movement towards my goals. For me, this extraordinary race is the best school of life (and also - concentrated life - when everything happens with great intensity and speed), where I can test and verify many approaches and discoveries in nutrition, equipment, but first of all - in the natural unfoldment of your hidden unlimited potential. </p>
<p>I would like to summarise my experiences and findings in a beautiful book for you to use in your daily striving for not giving up, going forward, and for your life’s eternal pursuit for happiness. I believe that we are truly happy only when we exercise our maximum capacities in sport, creativity, career, and family - in all aspects of life.</p>

</div></div>","Short SummaryHello everybody!
My name is Stutisheel Lebedev, and I am a 9-time finisher of the world’s longest race - the  3100-Mile Self-Transcendence Race, that takes place annually in Queens, New York. For my best performance, it took me 48 days to complete the distance, averaging 64.3 miles per day. 
I take it as a natural quality to share the best you have. My participation in the 3100-Mile Race changed my life dramatically - I saw and became aware of many things that block or delay the movement towards my goals. For me, this extraordinary race is the best school of life (and also - concentrated life - when everything happens with great intensity and speed), where I can test and verify many approaches and discoveries in nutrition, equipment, but first of all - in the natural unfoldment of your hidden unlimited potential. 
I would like to summarise my experiences and findings in a beautiful book for you to use in your daily striving for not giving up, going forward, and for your life’s eternal pursuit for happiness. I believe that we are truly happy only when we exercise our maximum capacities in sport, creativity, career, and family - in all aspects of life.

Inside the Book
These are the chapters I would like to include in my book as of today: 

DisciplineYour own styleEnjoying each momentDeterminationInner cryFollowing your heartHumorFullness of lifeBeyond the boundariesBest friendsSearching for the solutionsAn Effective Relaxation Best personal exampleGratitudeOne PowerRevealing secretsGlobal picture of lifeMystery of the Big Race
With your sincere help of funding the publishing of my book, I will be able to spread the spirit of the 3100-Mile Self-Transcendence Race and inspire people to have faith in themselves and to believe that nothing is impossible. I see it as a BIG positive creative impact in everybody’s daily life. 
I request you not only to contribute the money-power, but to BE a part of this impact, spreading the message by personal example.
What Is Needed & What You Get



My goal is to have  two books of the same content -  one in English and the other - in Russian simultaneously. I will self-publish the books through Create Space. But my desire is to make it as professional and beautiful as possible. Therefore I will need to cover the following expenses:
•Editing, proof reading, and cover design work•Translation•Printing layout and e-book formatting•Printing of the paper book itself•Sales description, marketing campaigns and promotions
I strongly believe that the book will be usefull not only to runners, but to many people who are seek  achieving their goals in life harmoniously. In case the main fundraising goal is not met, I will still try my best in accomplishing my goals in order given above. I promise to deliver the books for you under all circumstances.


The Impact


There are only 38 runners in the world who successfully finished the 3100-Mile Race since its inception in 1997. Together with Grahak, my friend from Australia, we try to convey our first-hand experiences of this unimaginably tough race outwardly, but extremely joyful and even delightful inwardly. We are the two runners-writers, who try to rise the curtain about what happens during the Big Race. The secrets of never giving up and doing the best you can under all conditions are universal secrets that work in achieving every challenging goal in life.

YOUR HELP IS NEEDED!

    Why Are We Right for this Project? The Crime Report has a history of groundbreaking investigations that examine the murkiest corners of the U.S. criminal justice system. Our stories have shed light on tens of thousands of wrongful convictions, financially shady prisoner re-entry and substance abuse programs and failures to prosecute environmental crimes.
These are risky, long-term projects, that require hard-nosed reporting, but our reporters have a history of taking on big challenges and returning fearless journalism that challenges authorities.
    Risks & Challenges We're hoping to complete this project this spring, but deadlines are finicky in journalism, especially when you're seeking access to information the government would often not prefer see the light of day. That said, we won't stop working on this until we can present a clear picture of what exactly is the line between acceptable and outrageous government conduct.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Below you will find a more detailed breakdown of the ways in which we plan to use these vehicles to ensure that Burning Bridges will sustain itself long after this fundraiser ends.    </p>
<p><b>Ads: </b> </p>

<p>Though set monthly donations will earn those who choose to donate access to this special content, the content on the network’s blogs will remain frequent and accessible to all visitors. </p>
<p><b>Merchandise: </b></p>
<p>Several of our contributors are talented artists and crafters and they already have a variety of plans for Burning Bridges specific merchandise in the works. This merchandise may be sold through a Burning Bridges Store, flash sales or promotional auctions, with proceeds going towards the network. </p>

<p>Balboa Park fue nombrado por Vasco Núñez de Balboa, el primer explorador europeo en cruzar el Istmo de Panamá hasta el Océano Pacífico en 1513.  En 1915-1916, el Parque Balboa en San Diego sirvió como sede de la Exposición Panamá-California, una monumental feria mundial que conmemora la terminación del Canal de Panamá. La Exposición estableció el escenario para que el Parque Balboa se convertirá en el centro cultural de San Diego para los visitantes de todo el mundo para las generaciones por venir. En 1935-1936, el Parque Balboa fue sede de la Exposición Internacional Califomia-Pacífico, la segunda feria mundial que incluyó la construcción significativa en el parque, incluyendo las Casas Internacionales del Pacífico. Las Casas internacionales situado en el interior del Parque Balboa, eran los dormitorios originales para acoger el Capitán y Almirante de los primeros barcos que venían por el Canal de Panamá en 1914.</p><p>                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1404513/files/20150421203823-28-THANKYOU_SPANISH.png?1429673903"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>MUCHAS GRACIAS</p>

Ayúdenos a alcanzar los 220,000 dólares necesarios para construir un museo dedicado a Panamá en los EE.UU.; una institución que va a durar para siempre en los corazones y las mentes de los visitantes.
El museo de Casa de Panamá será construida en el corazón de los 1,200 acres en el Parque Balboa de San Diego; un tesoro cultural que debutó para la Exposición Panamá-California en 1915 para celebrar la apertura de nuestra maravilla de la ingeniería, el Canal de Panamá.
Es tiempo, 100 años después, para construir la Casa de Panamá para mostrar la rica y larga historia entre Panamá y San Diego ... y más ... a los 10 millones de visitantes cada año al Parque Balboa.
Considere hacer una donación deducible de impuestos hoy...y visitar nuestro museo de mañana! Tiene previsto iniciar construcción a finales de 2015/principios de 2016, gracias a su contribución! Estamos muy contentos de que te unas a nosotros para hacer posible la construcción!La Casa de Panamá será un museo panameño sin fines de lucro que se construirá fuera del Istmo de Panamá. La nueva construcción será 590 pies cuadrados.  La construcción cumplirá con las restricciones arquitectónicas históricas del Parque Balboa de acuerdo a la época del renacimiento español. La planta baja será el museo y la cocina, y el sótano se utilizará como depósito. La Casa de Panamá va a compartir un baño y la escalera con la Casa de Colombia como se ve en el plan a continuación:Los visitantes de la Casa de Panamá podrán disfrutar del sabor del espíritu vibrante y el sabor de Panamá, desde lo histórico a lo moderno de hoy en día. Más información sobre los profundos vínculos históricos entre San Diego y Panamá; particularmente el debut simultánea del Canal de Panamá y el Parque Balboa para la Exposición Panamá-California de 1915. Descubre la maravilla de la ingeniería del Canal de Panamá, una de las Siete Maravillas del Mundo Moderno, en el proceso de su expansión actual; cinco sitios del Patrimonio Mundial de la UNESCO (Casco Viejo/Panamá Viejo, Portobelo/San Lorenzo, Parque Nacional Coiba, el Parque Nacional del Darién y el Parque Nacional La Amistad), el patrimonio cultural de siete grupos indígenas; el semillero de la biodiversidad; el Biomuseo moderno diseñado por Frank Gehry; y las artesanías intrincadas creados por talentosos artesanos. La Casa de Panamá contará con más de 590 pies cuadrados de artefactos.
DENTRO DE LAS PAREDES DE LA CASA DE PANAMÁ SERÁ:
• Un modelo interactivo del Canal de Panamá
• Manualidades para niños
• Múltiples pantallas y video de la cultura panameña, arte, historia, biodiversidad, destino de jubilación / turistica / negocios y gastronomía
• Rotación de exposiciones con artistas talentosos, músicos, autores y atletas de Panamá, entre otros
• Talleres y conciertos musicales de talentosos músicos locales y de Panamá
• Degustaciones culinarias
• Libros de autores panameños
• Presentaciones folclóricas de la Casa de Panamá Sonares de mi Tierra y el Grupo Juvenil
• Biblioteca de libros que muestran Panamá
• Programación Pública, incluyendo alojamiento de profesores invitados, excursiones privadas, viajes de estudio / clases, y web-casting de eventos
Desarrollar una apreciación de un país que, en palabras del libertador Simón Bolívar, es “Panamá ... Puente del Mundo, Corazón del Universo”.  Sólo se tarda una hora en llegar desde el Océano Atlántico hasta el Océano Pacífico en carro. Así acariciado es Panamá, que en 2014, International Living clasificó Panamá el mejor destino en el mundo para jubilarse, siete veces seguidas (http://internationalliving.com/2014/01/panama-worlds-best-retirement-haven-2014/).
Te llevaremos al corazón de este istmo de Panamá ...
Quién sabe, puede que desee visitar pronto! No podemos esperar traer Panamá a San Diego!                  La Casa de Panamá necesita $220,000 para diseñar y construir el museo. Hasta la fecha, la Casa de Panamá ha recaudado $45,000 y ha recibido compromisos por un total de $40,000. La Casa de Panamá ha pagado $10,000 para los planos arquitectónicos y el proceso de permisos. Ahora necesitamos el suelo restantes $135,000 para iniciar la construcción, el objetivo de esta campaña IndieGoGo.
Hay un gran impulso en este momento, ya que 2015 también marca el año en que los alcaldes de las ciudades de Panamá y San Diego firmarán un acuerdo para convertirse Ciudades Hermanas; el 25 aniversario de la Casa de Panamá y las continuas celebraciones del Centenario del Parque Balboa.                           Beneficios
Todas las donaciones para financiar el costo de diseño y construcción serán reconocidas prominente dentro la nueva Casa de Panamá. Los patrocinadores serán reconocidos en un libro “Legado Patrocinio” con su nombre inscrito o en las paredes de la Casa de Panamá.Realmente será un legado duradero. Su respaldo de este museo ayudará a asegurar a largo plazo viabilidad de una institución cultural importante.  Usted puede ayudar donando ahora a la Casa de Panamá a través de esta página Indiegogo; en línea a través de PayPal en www.houseofpanama.org; o mediante el envío de un cheque a: Casa de Panamá, PO Box 16146, San Diego, CA 92176.
Como una organización 501(c)(3) sin fines de lucro, las donaciones a la Casa de Panamá son deducibles de impuestos, con Tax ID # 71-0954067.                      La historia del Parque Balboa en San Diego está directamente relacionada con Panamá desde hace 100 años en 1914; cuando el Parque Balboa abrió sus puertas a celebrar la apertura del Canal de Panamá durante su Exposición Panamá-California de 1915.  La construcción de una Casa de Panamá en el Parque Balboa cimentará la importancia histórica de la construcción del Canal de Panamá para la Ciudad de San Diego.  La transmisión de la herencia de la rica cultura de Panamá será duradera.  El Parque Balboa ha existido por alrededor de 100 años y estará aquí para muchas generaciones por venir.Los 10 millones de visitantes que visitan el Parque Balboa anualmente tendrán acceso a la Casa de Panamá y sus numerosas actividades en el Parque Balboa.  Durante 25 años, la Casa de Panamá no ha tenido un espacio suficiente grande en el que exponer el Parque Balboa los visitantes de su rica cultura e historia. Se ha limitado a asistir a eventos organizados celebrado al aire libre, espacios de las Casas Internacionales del Pacífico, y otros museos que nos han prestado su espacio.  Tenemos una pequeña vitrina 3 pies cúbicos junto a otros 33 naciones en el Salón de las Naciones. El Salón de las Naciones esta pasando por una renovación a largo plazo y se encuentra actualmente cerrado al público, y la vitrina de la Casa de Panamá esta inaccesible al público.                                                            Con un museo propio, la Casa de Panamá tiene como objetivo informar a los visitantes de la riqueza de la historia y el enlace a San Diego, así como inspirar a millones de visitantes para viajar a Panamá. Hay un gran impulso en este momento, ya que 2015 también marca el año en que los alcaldes de la ciudades de Panamá y San Diego firmarán un acuerdo para convertirse en Ciudades Hermanas; el 25 aniversario de la Casa de Panamá y las continuas celebraciones del Centenario por todas partes del Parque Balboa.
La Casa de Panamá es un participante activo en el Comité Directivo de San Diego-Panamá Hermana Ciudades. La construcción de una Casa de Panamá puede ayudar a facilitar el intercambio de actividades culturales, el desarrollo de un programa de intercambio de estudiantes, y ayudar a consolidar las asociaciones económicas entre las ciudades hermanas.MÁS HISTORIA:
Balboa Park fue nombrado por Vasco Núñez de Balboa, el primer explorador europeo en cruzar el Istmo de Panamá hasta el Océano Pacífico en 1513.  En 1915-1916, el Parque Balboa en San Diego sirvió como sede de la Exposición Panamá-California, una monumental feria mundial que conmemora la terminación del Canal de Panamá. La Exposición estableció el escenario para que el Parque Balboa se convertirá en el centro cultural de San Diego para los visitantes de todo el mundo para las generaciones por venir. En 1935-1936, el Parque Balboa fue sede de la Exposición Internacional Califomia-Pacífico, la segunda feria mundial que incluyó la construcción significativa en el parque, incluyendo las Casas Internacionales del Pacífico. Las Casas internacionales situado en el interior del Parque Balboa, eran los dormitorios originales para acoger el Capitán y Almirante de los primeros barcos que venían por el Canal de Panamá en 1914.                  MUCHAS GRACIAS
Gracias por tomarse el tiempo de leer esto y ver nuestro video; y teniendo en cuenta lo que su donación podrá hacer. Todo esto es un trabajo de amor, que seguimos dando mientras buscamos maneras de compartir nuestro amor por Panamá. Usted no tiene que ser de Panamá para apreciar el entusiasmo y dedicación de nuestros voluntarios.  Este museo es posible.  Pero para hacerlo - y para que sea un espacio fantástico - necesitamos tu ayuda!Riesgos y Desafíos
La Casa de Panamá será construida. Es una de las nueve casas que ha ido a través de un proceso formal de obtener la aprobación de varios comités históricos y de la ciudad; y tiene el apoyo de su alcalde Kevin L. Faulconer; que quiere inaugurar la construcción a finales de 2015. Con sus 25 años de historia como organización, los profundos vínculos históricos entre San Diego y Panamá, la colaboración como un equipo con otros ocho museos artesanales que se construirá, y la unidad de sus voluntarios, la Casa de Panamá avanzara con éxito.
Al igual que con cualquier tipo de construcción puede haber retrasos debido a los acontecimientos que ocurren en el Parque Balboa, sin embargo los arquitectos tienen un plan para minimizar el impacto en el flujo de tráfico y peatones en el Parque Balboa, y ha sido aprobado por el Ayuntamiento de la Comisión de Planificación de San Diego.

self-image, I decided to believe in myself and my capacity to grow, to not
fear the journey, and to take a leap of faith into the unknown. </p>

About Beautifully Shaken 



The Beginning
of an Inner Journey. There are
moments when our inner voice encourages us to go deep within to gain a better
understanding of our life experiences. If
we follow this encouragement, many of us soon learn that we’ve been conditioned to believe that we are
somehow less than the true wonder of our authentic self. Through examining the choices we’ve made in the past, we
can see that this deeply ingrained belief triggers our self-doubts and alters our
life’s path in significant ways.




Change. This stark and sudden awareness will likely
astound us. We now know that we’re much more
deserving and worthy than we’ve believed ourselves to be.  We also now know that we and we alone are responsible
for what we do with our gift of life. This awakening is our second chance. It’s what
we’ve been longing for: the arrival of the inner clarity, support, and motivation to help
make the difficult choices necessary for true and lasting change.  

Change is
rarely easy. It involves facing the inner
challenges of accepting truth, acknowledging our hurt and pain, asking
ourselves big questions, altering old beliefs, forgiving ourselves and others, letting
go, and so much more.



My Story
of Change. I’ve just described the
pivotal point in my life when I decided to find my way back to my true
self. Five years ago, I came to understand that my life had been significantly
influenced by unresolved issues resulting from the difficult relationship I had
with my mother. Deeply disappointed in myself for having allowed my past to influence my choices and
self-image, I decided to believe in myself and my capacity to grow, to not
fear the journey, and to take a leap of faith into the unknown. 





Applying Neuroscience. Once I had
done the necessary inner work, it was from this newly transformed self that I
would begin to evolve into my greater potential. I soon came across the world of neuroscience
and its relationship to what makes us who we are. 




Neuroscience is currently in
the midst of an exciting and unprecedented era of research breakthroughs.
Through neuroscience, I now understand that the desire to change our lives is achievable and supported by the way our
brains function. Change occurs from within – our thoughts, beliefs, and our inner narratives create our reality. Through paying attention and feeling the wonder of thinking deliberately,
we can begin to create new neuropatterns and ultimately change our beliefs, our
state of being, and our very reality. We can change even lifelong thoughts
and beliefs. Just imagine: What would your life be like if you could begin to remove your self doubts?  
I’ve learned how to use the basics of neuroscience
as a tool for mastering my thoughts and for more clearly understanding my past,
present, and the greater potential of my future. This has been an awesome journey, and I would now like to share it with you in Beautifully Shaken. 
The Need 
When I began writing Beautifully Shaken, I
didn’t realize just how expensive this endeavor would be! I had no idea how
much writing and research time would be required. I was also surprised to learn about the many facets of industry expertise needed not only to create a quality product, but also to help with marketing and promotions.   

In order to make the dream of Beautifully Shaken a reality, $13,600 is needed. 
This will pay for the following expenses:
1 - Pre-publishing: includes content and line editing, revisions, proofreading, and the book's back cover
copy.
2 - Publishing: includes cover design, digital
formatting, print interior layout, and book registrations.  
3 - Marketing: includes a book website, social
media and technical support, and print media marketing. 
4 - Other expenses include campaign
support, Indiegogo and PayPal fees, and shipping costs.  

Your generous
financial support will be used to publish e-book and print editions of Beautifully Shaken.

What You Will Receive


Perks
include a personal Thank You email from the author, e-book and print copies of the book, shipment
of books to individuals as gifts in your name, 90-minute phone calls with the
author, a personal tribute, a list of five to eight of your inner strengths and guidance
on how you can begin to master them, an Authentic Life Path plan, and your name
included in the Acknowledgements section of the book.
Risks & Challenges
 

After
months of writing, I've written my first draft. I now have a product! While I’m ecstatic about the manuscript and the early positive feedback that I've received, it’s now time to work with my editors
and a self-publishing house to create a polished, quality book. Your donation will
contribute towards meeting my funding goal, which in turn will help get this book into readers' hands. 
Other Ways You Can Help1 - By recognizing that every
contribution is important! Together, we can reach the goal of $13,600 in 30
days!

Industrial Hemp</b></h2><p><b>
</b></p><p>Most of the world—including now a majority of these united
states—understands industrial hemp to be a valuable plant that can be grown
sustainably for oil, seed and fiber and is useful in the manufacture of food, body care, textiles, paper and construction and other products.

<p>Unfortunately, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) irrationally conflates industrial hemp with marijuana. The scientific
literatures of biology, chemistry and medicine all agree: <i>industrial hemp is
not marijuana</i>. The evidence is compelling and it’s time to compel DEA to
heed such evidence.</p>

<p><b>Industrial Hemp is Not Marijuana</b></p>
<p>Industrial hemp and marijuana are different varieties of <i>Cannabis
sativa</i> L. The former has a long history as a raw material for a variety of
useful products (rope, canvass, etc.), while the latter is favored for its
intoxicating properties. Industrial hemp is not intoxicating, so it cannot be
“abused” as a drug—because industrial hemp is not a drug.</p>
<p>It all comes down to the cannabinoid ratio of the
intoxicating THC (∆-9 tetrahydrocannabinol) and the non-intoxicating CBD
(cannabidiol) in a C. sativa plant. If the THC:CBD ratio is &lt;1, it is
industrial hemp; if &gt;1, it is marijuana.</p>

There are many lines of evidence that industrial

<p>The THC and CBD levels in 157 accessions of cannabis are
plotted above. It’s clear that selective breeding for marijuana has produced
strains high in THC (x symbols on chart) and low in CBD (the antidote to THC).
Selective breeding for industrial hemp has produced just the opposite (black
box symbols on chart). In between are intermediates (the remaining symbol on
chart) that approach THC:CBD ratios of 1.</p>
<p>When ingested, CBD acts as an antidote to THC, so it’s
obvious why marijuana growers select for not only high THC, but low CBD. It’s
also obvious that industrial hemp isn’t marijuana.</p>
<p><b>A Very Brief Legal History</b></p>
<p>In 1937, Congress enacted the Marihuana Tax Act. It placed a
prohibitively high tax on marihuana that was a crime not to pay. At the time,
Congress didn’t know as much about industrial hemp not being marijuana, but it
knew that what we now call industrial hemp was useful and the tax was reduced
to a very low amount for licensed “marihuana” (pronounced “industrial hemp”)
growers. Over the decades, it became increasingly difficult for farmers to get
licenses, save for World War II when the Japanese cut off our supplies of
Manila hemp (not a true hemp). Until 2014, the last legal industrial hemp crop
was grown in Wisconsin in 1957.</p>

<blockquote><i>As there was a war on, the federal government actively
promoted industrial hemp cultivation during World War II. Source: Internal
Revenue Service, US Department of the Treasury available from Wikipedia.</i></blockquote>
<p>In 1970, Congress enacted the Controlled Substances Act and
any distinction federal law made in regard to what was increasingly called
industrial hemp was lost to the statute books.</p>
<p><b>While Much Policy and Political Progress Has Occurred,
It’s Still Generally Illegal to Cultivate Industrial Hemp in the United States</b></p>
<p>While there has been much political progress to relegalize
industrial hemp, it is not enough to sustain the ecologically, economically and
socially viable domestic cultivation of industrial hemp. In the United States,
while it is generally legal to possess industrial hemp and products made from
it, it is generally not legal to grow industrial hemp.</p>
<p>The good news is that 27 of these united states have
reformed their drug laws so as to no longer treat industrial hemp as marijuana
(some other states may soon follow). Some states have even enacted laws to
promote industrial hemp cultivation. In the <a href=""http://www.votehemp.com/2014_farm_bill_section_7606.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2014 farm bill,
Congress allowed for the limited cultivation of industrial hemp for research
purposes</a>. However, U.S. industrial hemp cultivation is limited <i>solely</i>:</p>
<p>• 
(a) to states that have legalized industrial
hemp;</p>
<p>• 
(b) by state or academic institutions; and</p>
<p>• 
(c) for research purposes.</p>
<p>That means that industrial hemp cultivation is still illegal
in 23 states and cannot be freely grown in any state.</p>
<p>In the U.S. House of Representatives, 66 Members (including
23 Republicans) have signed on to the Industrial Hemp Farming Act (<a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/525?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hemp%22%5D%7D&amp;resultIndex=2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">H.R.
525</a>), sponsored by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) that would fully legalize
industrial hemp cultivation. In the U.S. Senate, 11 senators have cosponsored
companion legislation (<a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/134?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hemp%22%5D%7D&amp;resultIndex=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">S.134</a>)
sponsored by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
(R-KY) and presidential candidates Rand Paul (R-KY) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
Alas, neither bill has been given a hearing. You can find the latest
information on political actions to relegalize industrial hemp on the <a href=""http://www.votehemp.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vote Hemp</a> website.  </p>

<p><b>Petitioning the Government for Redress of Grievances</b></p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">First Amendment</a>
of the United States Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to “petition
the government for a redress of grievances.” One way this right has been
operationalized is through the <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/part-I/chapter-5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Administrative
Procedure Act of 1946 </a>(APA), which provides for citizens to file formal
administrative rulemaking petitions, in this case to change the rules that say
industrial hemp is marijuana.</p>
<p>Under the law, a government rule must be based on “<a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">substantial evidence</a>.”
Industrial hemp is, as a matter of fact, not marijuana. Most other industrial
democracies distinguish the two varieties of <i>C. sativa </i>as now do the majority
of U.S. states. It’s not rational for DEA to continue to conflate industrial
hemp and marijuana. If accepted, the formal petition will end the near eight
decades of inappropriate illegality for a very useful plant.</p>
<p><b>The Relegalizing Industrial Hemp Formal Administrative
Rulemaking Petition</b></p>
<p>First, we file the petition. It will be fully documented and
fully cited and be at least 100 pages.</p>
<p>Then, it is likely that DEA will sit on the petition and not
do what is required by its own regulations and by the APA. After a reasonable
amount of time (around a year), if DEA hasn’t told the petitioners that it is
actually considering the petition, petitioners will file a procedural lawsuit
in federal court to compel DEA to act. The judge would likely put DEA on a
timeline such that if DEA failed to adhere, the agency or its officials could
be held in contempt of court.</p>
<p>Eventually, DEA will decide on the petition. But before
that, under its own <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f0ed0e886c321c9efe15e44477c980fb&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt21.9.1308&amp;rgn=div5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">regulations</a>
to carry out the <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/chapter-13/subchapter-I"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Controlled
Substances Act</a> (CSA), DEA must refer our petition to the Secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for an expert scientific opinion
on whether industrial hemp is marijuana.</p>
<p>If HHS agrees that industrial hemp is not marijuana, then
DEA must accept that finding and change its rules meaning industrial hemp would
be removed from the Controlled Substances Schedule! While the scientific and medical
evidence is overwhelming that industrial hemp is not marijuana, it is likely
that HHS and DEA will not change their contention.</p>
<p>Petitioners will seek an evidentiary hearing and an
opportunity to cross-examine the HHS official who prepares the recommendation
report to DEA. We will build the administrative record to prepare for
substantive litigation to ask a federal judge to find DEA’s decision on the
petition, if contrary to the requested result, arbitrary and capricious and
without substantial evidence.</p>
<p><b>If DEA Says Yes</b></p>
<p>If DEA <i>accepts</i> our formal administrative rulemaking
petition, then the Relgalizing Industrial Hemp Project was a <i>stunning</i>
success. It’s farming time!</p>
<p><b>If DEA Says No</b></p>
<p>If DEA <i>rejects</i> our formal administrative rulemaking
petition, then the Relegalizing Industrial Hemp Project was a <i>qualified</i>
success. It’s litigation time!</p>
<p>A Relegalizing Industrial Hemp Project—Phase II will be launched
to fund the substantive litigation over the denial of the official petition
submitted under this Relegalizing Industrial Hemp Project—Phase I.</p>
<p><b>How About Those Perks?!</b></p>
<p>We’re not making a great new device or creating a work of

<p>Progressively larger contributions result in progressively
more prominent visibility of your name. If you make a $10,000 contribution
(yay!!), alas we can’t add any visual prominence to your name in the petition,
as it will be on the cover page along with other official petitioners!</p>
<p>While the legend that the 18th Century Massachusetts
merchant, smuggler, statesman, and prominent patriot of the American Revolution
John Hancock signed his name so large on the Declaration of Independence was
that so King George III could see it without his spectacles is apocryphal,
here’s your chance to not require the DEA Administrator to reach for their
glasses.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>To fully relegalize industrial hemp in the United States,
either the:</p>
<p>• Congress must amend the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to
redefine “marihuana” to not include industrial hemp; or </p>
<p>• the Drug Enforcement Administration must do the same thing by
amending its regulations, using authority to do so granted by Congress in the
CSA.</p>
<p>While we believe the votes would be there in both houses of
Congress to enact the Industrial Hemp Farming Act into law—if the bills were
allowed to receive a floor vote—the general dysfunction of Congress these days
mean that such events are highly unlikely. When Congress enacted the CSA, it
provided for the DEA to add to, delete from, or move within the official drug
schedules, based on new information. In regard to industrial hemp, DEA has
failed to do its job. Congress doesn’t have to act on legislation, but DEA has
to act upon a formal administrative rulemaking petition. There is no doubt as
to whether industrial hemp will be fully relegalized in the United States; the
only question is when. The formal administrative rulemaking petition is to
ensure timely relegalization. Industrial hemp advocates must continue to exert
political pressure on Congress. The formal administrative rulemaking petition
will exert political pressure on the Administration and if it doesn’t work, legal
pressure will also be applied. </p>
<p><b>What If We Exceed the Indiegogo Project Goal?</b></p>
<p>The $40,000 goal was chosen to meet the minimum
<i>bare-bones</i> project budget. $40,000 is enough to get the project done (and we
will!), but it doesn’t actually cover all the legitimate costs that should be
covered.</p>
<p>A proper and fair budget for the project is $207,000 and we
are also trying to raise funds from sources outside of Indiegogo. As
$167,000 is quite a difference, just what would we do with the “extra” money?</p>
<p>First and foremost, the chief petitioners would be
compensated equitably. Under the $40,000 budget, we’ll be working for far less than
minimum wage. If we raise more than $40,000—either in Indiegogo and/or
outside of Indiegogo—we’ll pay ourselves closer to what we make per hour
working for other clients. We wouldn’t have to sleep on people’s floors, we
could avoid red-eye plane flights and we wouldn’t have to reach into our own

<p>If we were merely soulless economic actors, we’d simply do an Indiegogo campaign for $207,000 and if not enough of you stepped up, we’d step out
and go back to making our livings doing other work. However, we are in a very
poor bargaining position, because our passion is relegalizing industrial hemp
for the benefit of this and future generations. This twin curses of caring and commitment means
that to do this project for $40,000 (and we will!), we’re sacrificing money

for retirement.</p>

track for historic change. The policy, political, social, economic and
environmental stars are aligning. This alignment is a convergence of outside
forces unrelated (but beneficial to this effort) and the great past and

This formal rulemaking petition can be what bumps that most important star into

Industrial Hemp
Most of the world—including now a majority of these united
states—understands industrial hemp to be a valuable plant that can be grown
sustainably for oil, seed and fiber and is useful in the manufacture of food, body care, textiles, paper and construction and other products. (See Hemp Industries Association and North American Industrial Hemp Council
websites for more information.)
From the seeds and the stalks of industrial hemp
can be made many useful products. Source: Congressional Research Service,
adapted from d. G. Kraenzel et al. “Industrial Hemp as an Alternative Crop in
North Dakota. North Dakota State University. 1998.
Unfortunately, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) irrationally conflates industrial hemp with marijuana. The scientific
literatures of biology, chemistry and medicine all agree: industrial hemp is
not marijuana. The evidence is compelling and it’s time to compel DEA to
heed such evidence.

Industrial Hemp is Not Marijuana
Industrial hemp and marijuana are different varieties of Cannabis
sativa L. The former has a long history as a raw material for a variety of
useful products (rope, canvass, etc.), while the latter is favored for its
intoxicating properties. Industrial hemp is not intoxicating, so it cannot be
“abused” as a drug—because industrial hemp is not a drug.
It all comes down to the cannabinoid ratio of the
intoxicating THC (∆-9 tetrahydrocannabinol) and the non-intoxicating CBD
(cannabidiol) in a C. sativa plant. If the THC:CBD ratio is <1, it is
industrial hemp; if >1, it is marijuana.

The Drug Enforcement Administration is the only entity
that conflates industrial hemp and marijuana. Source: Andy Kerr, The Larch
Company, Ashland, OR and Washington, DC. 2015 (Source for each entity will be cited in the
formal administrative rulemaking petition).


There are many lines of evidence that industrial
hemp is not marijuana. Here’s one of them. 




Industrial Industrial hemp and marijuana are distinguished by widely
different THC:CBD ratios. Source: Hillig, Karl W. and Paul G. Mahlberg. 2004 A
Chemotaxonomic Analysis of Cannabinoid Variation in Cannabis (Cannabaceae).
American Journal of Botany 91(6): 966-975.

The THC and CBD levels in 157 accessions of cannabis are
plotted above. It’s clear that selective breeding for marijuana has produced
strains high in THC (x symbols on chart) and low in CBD (the antidote to THC).
Selective breeding for industrial hemp has produced just the opposite (black
box symbols on chart). In between are intermediates (the remaining symbol on
chart) that approach THC:CBD ratios of 1.
When ingested, CBD acts as an antidote to THC, so it’s
obvious why marijuana growers select for not only high THC, but low CBD. It’s
also obvious that industrial hemp isn’t marijuana.
A Very Brief Legal History
In 1937, Congress enacted the Marihuana Tax Act. It placed a
prohibitively high tax on marihuana that was a crime not to pay. At the time,
Congress didn’t know as much about industrial hemp not being marijuana, but it
knew that what we now call industrial hemp was useful and the tax was reduced
to a very low amount for licensed “marihuana” (pronounced “industrial hemp”)
growers. Over the decades, it became increasingly difficult for farmers to get
licenses, save for World War II when the Japanese cut off our supplies of
Manila hemp (not a true hemp). Until 2014, the last legal industrial hemp crop
was grown in Wisconsin in 1957.

As there was a war on, the federal government actively
promoted industrial hemp cultivation during World War II. Source: Internal
Revenue Service, US Department of the Treasury available from Wikipedia.
In 1970, Congress enacted the Controlled Substances Act and
any distinction federal law made in regard to what was increasingly called
industrial hemp was lost to the statute books.
While Much Policy and Political Progress Has Occurred,
It’s Still Generally Illegal to Cultivate Industrial Hemp in the United States
While there has been much political progress to relegalize
industrial hemp, it is not enough to sustain the ecologically, economically and
socially viable domestic cultivation of industrial hemp. In the United States,
while it is generally legal to possess industrial hemp and products made from
it, it is generally not legal to grow industrial hemp.
The good news is that 27 of these united states have
reformed their drug laws so as to no longer treat industrial hemp as marijuana
(some other states may soon follow). Some states have even enacted laws to
promote industrial hemp cultivation. In the 2014 farm bill,
Congress allowed for the limited cultivation of industrial hemp for research
purposes. However, U.S. industrial hemp cultivation is limited solely:
• 
(a) to states that have legalized industrial
hemp;
• 
(b) by state or academic institutions; and
• 
(c) for research purposes.
That means that industrial hemp cultivation is still illegal
in 23 states and cannot be freely grown in any state.
In the U.S. House of Representatives, 66 Members (including
23 Republicans) have signed on to the Industrial Hemp Farming Act (H.R.
525), sponsored by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) that would fully legalize
industrial hemp cultivation. In the U.S. Senate, 11 senators have cosponsored
companion legislation (S.134)
sponsored by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
(R-KY) and presidential candidates Rand Paul (R-KY) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
Alas, neither bill has been given a hearing. You can find the latest
information on political actions to relegalize industrial hemp on the Vote Hemp website.

Petitioning the Government for Redress of Grievances
The First Amendment
of the United States Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to “petition
the government for a redress of grievances.” One way this right has been
operationalized is through the Administrative
Procedure Act of 1946 (APA), which provides for citizens to file formal
administrative rulemaking petitions, in this case to change the rules that say
industrial hemp is marijuana.
Under the law, a government rule must be based on “substantial evidence.”
Industrial hemp is, as a matter of fact, not marijuana. Most other industrial
democracies distinguish the two varieties of C. sativa as now do the majority
of U.S. states. It’s not rational for DEA to continue to conflate industrial
hemp and marijuana. If accepted, the formal petition will end the near eight
decades of inappropriate illegality for a very useful plant.
The Relegalizing Industrial Hemp Formal Administrative
Rulemaking Petition
First, we file the petition. It will be fully documented and
fully cited and be at least 100 pages.
Then, it is likely that DEA will sit on the petition and not
do what is required by its own regulations and by the APA. After a reasonable
amount of time (around a year), if DEA hasn’t told the petitioners that it is
actually considering the petition, petitioners will file a procedural lawsuit
in federal court to compel DEA to act. The judge would likely put DEA on a
timeline such that if DEA failed to adhere, the agency or its officials could
be held in contempt of court.
Eventually, DEA will decide on the petition. But before
that, under its own regulations
to carry out the Controlled
Substances Act (CSA), DEA must refer our petition to the Secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for an expert scientific opinion
on whether industrial hemp is marijuana.
If HHS agrees that industrial hemp is not marijuana, then
DEA must accept that finding and change its rules meaning industrial hemp would
be removed from the Controlled Substances Schedule! While the scientific and medical
evidence is overwhelming that industrial hemp is not marijuana, it is likely
that HHS and DEA will not change their contention.
Petitioners will seek an evidentiary hearing and an
opportunity to cross-examine the HHS official who prepares the recommendation
report to DEA. We will build the administrative record to prepare for
substantive litigation to ask a federal judge to find DEA’s decision on the
petition, if contrary to the requested result, arbitrary and capricious and
without substantial evidence.
If DEA Says Yes
If DEA accepts our formal administrative rulemaking
petition, then the Relgalizing Industrial Hemp Project was a stunning
success. It’s farming time!
If DEA Says No
If DEA rejects our formal administrative rulemaking
petition, then the Relegalizing Industrial Hemp Project was a qualified
success. It’s litigation time!
A Relegalizing Industrial Hemp Project—Phase II will be launched
to fund the substantive litigation over the denial of the official petition
submitted under this Relegalizing Industrial Hemp Project—Phase I.
How About Those Perks?!
We’re not making a great new device or creating a work of
art. We’re seeking to change public policy for the benefit of this and future
generations. This all makes offering rewards more challenging. We cannot
provide you a new and useful device or a book or a DVD or a streaming
opportunity and other tangible items. We cannot offer you the opportunity to
see a play or a film or any other sensory experience. Fundamentally, your
reward will be knowing that you helped fund the relegalization of industrial
hemp in the United States after nearly eight decades of irrational illegality.
What we are offering as rewards is an opportunity to let the
Drug Enforcement Administration know directly that you believe they are wrong
about industrial hemp and are putting some money where your mouth is. In an
appendix to the formal administrative rulemaking petition we’ll be submitting
to DEA, we’ll include a list of the Relegalizing Industrial Hemp Project
supporters (if you don’t want on that list, but still want to contribute, just
let us know after you donate).
The larger the donation, the more prominent the listing.
Here’s what we mean:

Progressively larger contributions result in progressively
more prominent visibility of your name. If you make a $10,000 contribution
(yay!!), alas we can’t add any visual prominence to your name in the petition,
as it will be on the cover page along with other official petitioners!
While the legend that the 18th Century Massachusetts
merchant, smuggler, statesman, and prominent patriot of the American Revolution
John Hancock signed his name so large on the Declaration of Independence was
that so King George III could see it without his spectacles is apocryphal,
here’s your chance to not require the DEA Administrator to reach for their
glasses.
Conclusion
To fully relegalize industrial hemp in the United States,
either the:
• Congress must amend the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to
redefine “marihuana” to not include industrial hemp; or 
• the Drug Enforcement Administration must do the same thing by
amending its regulations, using authority to do so granted by Congress in the
CSA.
While we believe the votes would be there in both houses of
Congress to enact the Industrial Hemp Farming Act into law—if the bills were
allowed to receive a floor vote—the general dysfunction of Congress these days
mean that such events are highly unlikely. When Congress enacted the CSA, it
provided for the DEA to add to, delete from, or move within the official drug
schedules, based on new information. In regard to industrial hemp, DEA has
failed to do its job. Congress doesn’t have to act on legislation, but DEA has
to act upon a formal administrative rulemaking petition. There is no doubt as
to whether industrial hemp will be fully relegalized in the United States; the
only question is when. The formal administrative rulemaking petition is to
ensure timely relegalization. Industrial hemp advocates must continue to exert
political pressure on Congress. The formal administrative rulemaking petition
will exert political pressure on the Administration and if it doesn’t work, legal
pressure will also be applied. 
What If We Exceed the Indiegogo Project Goal?
The $40,000 goal was chosen to meet the minimum
bare-bones project budget. $40,000 is enough to get the project done (and we
will!), but it doesn’t actually cover all the legitimate costs that should be
covered.
A proper and fair budget for the project is $207,000 and we
are also trying to raise funds from sources outside of Indiegogo. As
$167,000 is quite a difference, just what would we do with the “extra” money?
First and foremost, the chief petitioners would be
compensated equitably. Under the $40,000 budget, we’ll be working for far less than
minimum wage. If we raise more than $40,000—either in Indiegogo and/or
outside of Indiegogo—we’ll pay ourselves closer to what we make per hour
working for other clients. We wouldn’t have to sleep on people’s floors, we
could avoid red-eye plane flights and we wouldn’t have to reach into our own
pockets to cover legitimate project expenses. We could compensate the outside
experts the project needs at a level they deserve and are worth.
If we were merely soulless economic actors, we’d simply do an Indiegogo campaign for $207,000 and if not enough of you stepped up, we’d step out
and go back to making our livings doing other work. However, we are in a very
poor bargaining position, because our passion is relegalizing industrial hemp
for the benefit of this and future generations. This twin curses of caring and commitment means
that to do this project for $40,000 (and we will!), we’re sacrificing money
that we could be making elsewhere, at the cost of having less money today and
for retirement.
If we exceed our total fundraising goals, any funds will be
reserved for the Relegalizing Industrial Hemp Project—Phase II—litigation in
federal court to overturn a negative decision by the Drug Enforcement
Administration (see “Risks and Challenges” below). 
This Indiegogo campaign will fund the creation and filing
and pursuit of a formal administrative rulemaking petition, including a final
decision by DEA.
If again true to form, DEA will continue to stonewall by
incorrectly conflating industrial hemp and marijuana and the agency will deny
the administrative rulemaking petition. This will be the end this Relegalizing
Industrial Hemp Project: Phase I and we would launch another Indiegogo Campaign
entitled Regalizing Industrial Hemp Protect: Phase II to raise funds for the
litigation (perhaps we’ll subtitle it “Suing the Bastards”).
Conclusion
The evidence is overwhelming and there is no substantial
evidence for DEA to continue to conflate industrial hemp and marijuana in the
federal drug schedules. Therefore, DEA would be acting in an arbitrary and
capricious manner and that is illegal under federal law. The continued legal
entwining of industrial hemp and marijuana is not based on substantial evidence

A federal court judge is unlikely to tell DEA what to do,
but only that what it did is illegal. The case will be remanded by the court to

excuses before we run out of Indiegogo projects.
The wheels of justice may grind slowly, but they grind
exceedingly fine. We’ll all have a fine time grinding away.

that our present civilisation is built on the exploitation of animals, just
as past civilisations were built on the exploitation of slaves, and we believe the
spiritual destiny of men is such that in time he will view with abhorrence the
idea that men once fed on the products of animals’ bodies.""
  
Risks and Challenges  I have the determination, dedication and insight but need your help to make an impact.  I realise I can't do this on my own.  This is why I need your help.  
Having sat on the board of trustees at The Vegan Society and having ran my own businesses - I have grown and taken knocks yet overcoming these obstacles I have been able to venture forth to achieve my goals.  Where I lack skills I turn to others who can aid me on my journey.  I recognise that I need to rely on others and on you. 
I need your help to kickstart this venture to set me on the road - to pioneer, set and bring about change in the world - we can do this.

and support in assisting you in every stage of writing to publish and archive
your life story.<b>
<br/></b></p><p><b>Why
The LifeStory Lighthouse?</b></p>
<p>My name is Rus VanWestervelt,
and I have been helping people share their stories for over 30 years for two
distinct reasons; first, to provide them the courage and the navigation to
transform their experiences into publishable letters, memorials, essays, and
even book-length works; second, to provide them the opportunity to write about
tragedy, violence, depression, and injustice so that their stories might
provide a light of hope to others in need. </p>
<p>My projects have been diverse,
from giving a voice to Marylanders after the attacks on America in 2001, to
providing teens throughout Maryland to share their life stories in a
professional publication that ran for 8 years, to offering lines of love and
hope to those struggling with depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. With the greatest care, I
have shared the power of writing therapy with victims of domestic violence, rape, racism, and gender
discrimination. Every single time, my goal has been to empower, provide courage
and support, and -- for some -- navigate them and their work to publication and share with a
larger audience. I have accomplished this through workshops, conferences, and
one-to-one sessions.</p>
<p>The time has come to strengthen
this light and reach more individuals, through more opportunities, so that
their life stories can be heard and even provide hope to others across the
country. 

</p><p>This has always been my calling
to serve others in helping them find their voice and share it with a larger audience.
Besides providing love and support for my family, it is the single most
important role in my life to fulfill. I’m asking you to help me help others
find – and share – their voices.</p>
<p>With your help, we can celebrate
the lives of the elderly and the terminally ill, capture the blessings in our
present experiences, and bring to life the struggles some face with mental
illness, victimization, abuse, and discrimination. </p>
<p>There has never been a greater
need for our voices to be heard. Help me build this LifeStory Lighthouse that
will serve as the bright navigation beacon of courage, hope, and guidance
toward publication. </p>
<p><b>Getting
Behind The Light To Help Others</b></p>
<p>The LifeStory Lighthouse is not
a single project, or a call to action; it’s a full-service organization that
offers workshops, conferences, one-to-one mentoring, writing strategies,
editing services, and publishing opportunities. I’m opening this business with
the call for an initial $5,000 to cover marketing and technology costs, initial
conference and workshop set-up fees, and publication costs to share the words
of others. </p>
<p>Every contribution made has an immediate 100% return on your investment. In fact, for those
who donate between $5 and $250, your return on your investment is 200%; all
contributions have benefits and perks that can be used for yourself or for
others. It’s your choice. </p>
<p>Here’s how it works. For
contributions between $5 and $250, I will double the value of your
contribution toward consulting, workshop or conference registration fees, or
publication products. For example, if you contribute $100, I issue you a $200 credit toward
any of the services provided. It’s that simple. </p>
<p>And, there are other special and
unique perks for those who contribute $250 or higher! I value your support, and
I am grateful for your contributions in helping others share their life
stories. Even if we don’t reach our full goal, you still get your double credit
for your contribution between $5 and $250, and your full perks for higher
contributions. This is not an all-or-nothing organization. The LifeStory
Lighthouse is here to stay. </p>
<p><b>Our
Stories Must Be Shared</b></p>
<p>In every single project that I
have initiated, I hear the same from my contributors and our readers: Thank you
for finally giving us the chance to share our story. </p>
<p>I have had the experience of
working with reluctant writers and storytellers all my life, and I know how to
empower them to find the courage within to share their stories – first with
themselves and then eventually with a larger audience. </p>
<p>I have had the experience of
working with victims and individuals struggling with mental illness or facing
discrimination who have not been able to articulate their challenges, or who
have been suppressed by others to share their authentic stories.<span>  </span></p>
<p>I have had the experience of
working with the elderly and the terminally ill to help them share their
stories, their message to the world. </p>
<p>As well, I have had the
experience of composing many memorials, eulogies, and tributes to and for
loved ones who have passed on. </p>
<p>We need to reach more people,
empower more individuals, provide more opportunities to share the stories that
have defined who we are. In this age of instant and miraculous communication,
it is terribly ironic that our true and authentic voices still cannot be heard.
</p>
<p>Help me change that. Help me build
a lighthouse for our parents, our brothers, our friends, and even ourselves to
let the world know that we were here, and we have made a difference. </p>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>In addition to your financial
support, I need help in spreading the word to the world about The LifeStory

ourselves): I have a story to tell; I just don’t know how to tell it. </p>

<h3>Dear Friends,</h3>
<p>It's been a wonderful journey so far, and I'm excited to embark on the last stage of my book tour! This campaign is crucial in covering the costs of my spring book tour where I will be traveling throughout the country to  share my work with gracious readers, students, and all-around terrific people.  </p>
<p>I’ll be coming to city near you to present and sign copies of my debut literary novel, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Juventud-Vanessa-Blakeslee/dp/1940430585/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JUVENTUD</a>,  now available from Curbside Splendor (Oct 2015). The above video features my exciting new book trailer: a delightful peek at my earliest beginnings, writing stories at age ten in my parents' diner office, along with highlights from the fall tour, including the official launch party hosted by Bookmark It in Orlando. I hope you find it inspiring!</p>
<p>Here’s a brief summary of the novel, the “story behind the story,” and why I need your support:</p>

<h3>Story Summary</h3>
<p><i>Juventud </i>explores the idealism of youth, the complexities of a ravaged country, and the stories we tell ourselves in order to survive. Growing up as the only daughter of a wealthy landowner in Santiago de Cali, Colombia, teenaged Mercedes Martinez knows a world of maids, armed guards, and private drivers. When she falls in love with Manuel, a fiery young activist with a passion for his faith and his country, she begins to understand the suffering of the <i>desplazados </i>who share her land. </p>
<p>A startling discovery about her father forces Mercedes to doubt everything she thought she knew about her life, and she and Manuel make plans to run away together. But before they can, tragedy strikes in a single violent night. Mercedes flees Colombia for the United States and a life she never could have imagined. Fifteen years later, she returns to Colombia seeking the truth, but discovers that only more questions await.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>My Journey  </h3>
<p>This riveting story, part sociopolitical thriller and part love story, lyrically told, marks the culmination of the copious research and drafting which I began in 2009, and relied on the support of several writers’ colonies to complete, including Yaddo, Ragdale, the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, and others. </p>
<p>After so many years of working on the project, I am ecstatic that <i>Juventud </i>has found a home with the Chicago-based independent press, Curbside Splendor Publishing, and I am committed to bringing the novel to the widest audience possible upon its release last fall.  This spring I am scheduled to present at the Tucson Festival of Books, the Virginia Festival of the Book, then will head to launch events in LA at the annual AWP conference, with more events pending for late spring/summer.  </p>

<h3>Why I Need Your Support</h3>
<p>I need your help and support to cover travel expenses, lodging, and meals from when the spring launch kicks off in March through June. I will be on leave from my part-time job at Bookmark It in Orlando, FL to promote the book. While the publisher is arranging the tour, they are not funding it. My only source of income during the spring will be the online writing workshop I’m teaching for UCF, which will allow me to maintain flexibility but will amount to a small paycheck that will just cover monthly essentials. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<div>Your support will make all the difference. <i>Juventud  </i>is a story I truly believe in, and audiences have been overwhelmingly captivated and moved by it so far. I can't wait to continue on the journey ahead, and bring the book to even more readers. I've been fortunate enough to have this novel, my first major literary work, published to a much critical acclaim from <i>Publisher's Weekly, Rain Taxi Review of Books, Washington Independent Review of Books, </i>the Jewish Book Council, the<i> Rumpus,</i> among many others. Just this week came the exciting news that it is on the long-list for the SIBA Pat Conroy Southern Book Prize and the Montaigne Medal for ""the year's most thought-provoking books."" Launching <i>Juventud </i>last fall has taught me a lot about the publishing world, but this next phase will be the most challenging yet.

a brief synopsis of the book from John:</p>
<p>""I intend to write a book about how we
process our feelings and/or emotions.  I want to take a look at what they
mean, how do we value or devalue them, what we do in allowing ourselves to be
with them and to really feel them as a way to leverage them to manifest what we
really want or desire in life. Above all how our feelings/emotions are the way
to a form of deeper listening and discernment of our most vulnerable and
authentic Self.  In coming home to who I really I am, I began with a
conversation with my inner child.  This engaging conversation helped me
discover my voice as an individual, healing through forgiveness of others and
myself and a deeper form of listening that is helping me to leverage my power
in speaking my truth.""</p>

<h3>It's been a rough week.  </h3>
<p>One of the things that’s kept me going however, was the outpouring of emotion and solidarity on Facebook this week from my friends and loved ones. I was so impressed and comforted that I had to capture it before the algorithms sucked it back into the void, buried underneath the cat videos and advertisements.  </p>
<p>So, on Wednesday afternoon, still reeling from the election, I conceived of this booklet: a collection of the most heart wrenching, life affirming and future looking posts from my Facebook news feed and beyond. </p>
<p><strong>After tragedy, life can too quickly turn back to normal. </strong></p>
<p>Daily routines take over - but, remember, as long as that racist pervert is in the Oval Office, there will be no safe normal for too many people in this country. As long as he spews ignorant climate-denying bullshit, the entire planet is in danger. </p>
<p>But, as long as we remember this great well of empathy and tap deep within out hearts, love will show us the way to resist. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>Our passion</strong> is to positively develop the Caribbean &amp; Latin America region. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>I lived in London, England for a few years. While London has pockets of Caribbean culture I was still missing being updated on things from my home country Trinidad and Tobago. Even with Social Media and the efficiency of the internet, there are several things pertaining to the Caribbean and Latin American daily lifestyle that is not easily available online. Much positive news gets lost in the clutter and the people within the region do not get many opportunities to tell their own stories.  These concerns are similar for migrants to the US, Asia, Europe and Africa. </p>
<p>I decided to create a solution, which is Country Vibes Magazine. At 1st, it was designed for persons from Trinidad and Tobago; both local and within the global diaspora. When we launched in Miami, at the Chamber of Commerce, people from the other English speaking countries wanted to be part of the magazine. With a small team, we redesign and connected to writers from various countries to ensure a uniquely authentic experience for the readers. At our 2nd launch in New York, Latinos and Haitians were requesting to be included, their culture is also Caribbean and the challenge for their migrants to be connected with back home is the same. So for the 3rd and final time, we have redesigned the publication and are connecting with writers and photographers from Cuba, Costa Rica, Panama and Haiti, as we also seek to expand outside of the region.  </p>
<p><br/><strong>These experiences have greatly educated us about the needs and have inspired us to create a quality lifestyle magazine that really appeals to all customers globally. </strong></p>

<h3>What's inside Country Vibes Magazine?</h3>
<p>The Caribbean and Latin America is so much more than just sun, sea and sand - though we have some of the most beautiful beaches and coral reefs in the world. While we are classified as developing countries, our rich history has caused us to really showcase diversity in harmony. Our rich cultures experienced through our food, music and vibes is reflected within our dynamic people, usually with warm smiles.  Country Vibes Magazine captures this and more within the following topic areas:</p>

<h3>Why is Country Vibes Magazine important?</h3>
<p>With a history which almost caused the extinction of the Carib people - from whom the region gain its name, followed by African slavery and then indentured labour, we progressed to hospitality and tourism. Now with the global transformation of tourism and growing poverty among various island states, in addition to weakening customer service and instability with many governments, we need to create avenues to inspire ourselves and to evolve as a region.</p>
<p>While Country Vibes is an amazing magazine, it is the start of a new revolution within the Caribbean &amp; Latin America. A movement where we the people are taking charge of our own and learning to harness our dynamic cultures and rhythms to lead our positive development and chart our future success. We will tell our stories from our eyes and we want to share this sacred sight and sounds with you as well as with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>We invite you to come with us on this exciting and adventurous journey. <strong>We have only just begun!!!</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Journey &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This has been a challenging journey, but creating a stable regional system is worth it. We have custom designed structures within a region with 33 different countries and hundreds of islands, with almost 630 million people separated by the sea and jungles. Over 10 different financial currencies. Over 6 formal languages. With poor and extremely costly transportation between the countries. As a multicultural, diverse people, we share a common beauty and rhythm, though in many ways we are strangers to each other with plantation remnants: still not heeding the call for emancipation sung by Bob Marley.</p>
<p><strong>With your support we can achieve</strong> several things that require high costs outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Have Country Vibes Magazine translated into several languages.</strong> This will allow the almost 630 million people within this region to experience this magazine in their own language.</li>
<li>
<strong>Complete a fulfilment &amp; logistics system</strong> whereby we can ship printed copies of Country Vibes Magazine throughout the region and any part of the world. The people have requested print more than e-magazines.</li>
<li>
<strong>Provide inspiration to the 630 million throughout the region</strong>, so they can use their creativity to solve the issues within the region and to design new paths for success.</li>
<li>
<strong>Introduce you, your friends, family and millions globally to Country Vibes </strong>- Be part of the beautiful and harmonising vibrations of the Caribbean &amp; Latin America.</li>

A modern story full of romance, drama, action, mind games and plot twists.<br/></p><h3><b>The story</b></h3><p><b>Odysseus </b>is a lonely, young guy that most people think is weird. His parents mistreat him as everybody else does, so the only company he has is his brother <b>Sam</b>. One day he meets a girl called Ithaki and he instantly falls in love with her. He is too shy to express his feelings though. All he does is going everyday to the kiosk she works just to be able to see her. Things move on from there, he saves her life a couple of times without <b>Ithaki </b>knowing who her saviour is and then he loses her for some years. </p><p>When he accidentally finds her again, always together with his brother, she gets kidnapped by a ruthless tycoon and a corrupted politician after she threatens to expose their illegal operations. Odysseus is following the traces of Ithaki trying to save her once again while being hunted by gangsters. With the help of Antigoni, a lawyer and old friend of Ithaki, he finds where she is being kept, but then things take a twist. </p><p><br/></p><h3>About us<br/>
</h3><p>We are <b>Alex Michelidakis</b> and <b>Chris Christopoulos</b>, from Athens, Greece. We work together in a supermarket while at the same time we write at various online magazines and blogs. We came up with the story for the book while at work. We created two fictional characters, Odysseus and Ithaki, one thing led to another and before we know it we had the whole plot ready in a few days! So then we started writing. Chris has already seen some of his stories published in various literature magazines, another one, ""Our Own"" was accompanying the cd release of George Alkaios under the same name, while he has won a short film script contest with ""A Fine Day For The End Of The World"" and very recently won the <b>award </b>for best novelette in the Larry Niven Fantasy awards with his story ""The Fairytale"". <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">For Alex it was the first attempt, but writing the book together worked out really well. </span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><h3>What we need and what you get</h3><p></p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Every little help from you counts and will bring us closer to our goal. Together we can make it happen as you can see at the end of the trailer we shot, showing one characteristic scene of the book.</span></p><p><br/></p><h4>A small sample</h4><p><i><b>Prologue</b></i><br/></p><p></p><p>He ran until his injured body sent his brain a clear 
mesage that it was pointless to go on. He only had moved a few blocks 
away from 
the appartment he was shot, standing now in a small square fortunately 
alone. That was good. He didn't want
 to be seen like this, covered in blood, what would he 
say? He sat on a bench to regain his power and to put his messy 
thoughts in some kind of order. He took a deep breath, filling his 
nostrils with the aroma of the trees and flowers surrounding him, and 
that made him feel a little better. It was that time again, the magic hour before day gave place to night that always fascinated him. The sky was covered with
 a purple, dreamy color that filled Odysseus with hope. Hope
 that anything could happen. And so much had happened lately, 
especially in the last few hours, that it was hard for him to handle. 
Everything that so far was defining his reality proved an illusion, forcing 
him to review his whole life as he knew it.</p><p>His head was still aching like hell, both internally (even if the fading was gone) and externally. The first bullet found him on the surface, right besides his 
right ear, but still was causing him an intolerant, unpleasant dizziness. 
The second one had hit him on his left side where the bleeding may had 
eased, but was draining the remaining energy left on his body. He
 tried to stand on his feet but felt so weak.
</p><p>There wasn't a place he could go, a shelter to hide until 
he could recover. His appartment was being watched and in a hospital he 
should give some good answers about his situation, something that 
would cause him further troubles. He knew he should keep running but 
that seemed a huge task to achieve, so he just leaned on the bench. 
Maybe that was it he thought. Besides, he had fulfilled his mission, 
getting a reward that all these years he could only dream of. So if this
 was supposed to be the end, let it be, he wouldn't mind.</p><b><i>..and in greek..</i></b><p><i></i>
</p><p>Έτρεξε
μέχρι το ταλαιπωρημένο κορμί του να δώσει εντολή στον εγκέφαλό του πως δεν
αντέχει άλλο. Δεν είχε απομακρυνθεί παρά μόλις μερικά τετράγωνα, όμως ένοιωθε
ότι ήταν μάταιο να συνεχίσει. Είχε φτάσει σε μια μικρή πλατεία, άδεια από
κόσμο. Ευτυχώς. Δεν ήθελε να τον δουν σε αυτή την κατάσταση, γεμάτο αίματα, τι
θα έλεγε; Έκατσε σε ένα παγκάκι να ανακτήσει λίγο τις δυνάμεις του και να βάλει
σε μια σειρά τις μπερδεμένες σκέψεις του.</p>
<p>Πήρε
μια βαθιά ανάσα, γεμίζοντας τα ρουθούνια του με τις ευωδίες των δέντρων που τον
περιτριγύριζαν, κάτι που τον έκανε να αισθανθεί λίγο καλύτερα. Ήταν εκείνη η
μαγική ώρα λίγο πριν η μέρα δώσει τη θέση της στη νύχτα που ανέκαθεν τον
γοήτευε. Ο ουρανός είχε πάρει μία παραμυθένια, μενεξεδιά απόχρωση που τον
γέμιζε ελπίδες πως όλα μπορούν να συμβούν. Κι είχαν γίνει τόσα πολλά τον
τελευταίο καιρό, ειδικά τις τελευταίες ώρες, που του ήταν δύσκολο να τα
διαχειριστεί. Είχαν ανατραπεί όλα όσα μέχρι τότε προσδιόριζαν την πραγματικότητά
του, κάνοντάς τον να αναθεωρήσει τη ζωή του όπως τη γνώριζε ως τώρα.</p>

Το κεφάλι του εξακολουθούσε να τον πονάει, τόσο
εσωτερικά (αν και οι διαλείψεις είχαν σταματήσει) όσο και εξωτερικά. Η σφαίρα
τον είχε τραυματίσει επιφανειακά, ακριβώς δίπλα στο αυτί, δεν έπαυε όμως να του
προκαλεί μία ανυπόφορα δυσάρεστη ζαλάδα, ενώ και η αιμορραγία στο πλευρό του

A modern story full of romance, drama, action, mind games and plot twists.The storyOdysseus is a lonely, young guy that most people think is weird. His parents mistreat him as everybody else does, so the only company he has is his brother Sam. One day he meets a girl called Ithaki and he instantly falls in love with her. He is too shy to express his feelings though. All he does is going everyday to the kiosk she works just to be able to see her. Things move on from there, he saves her life a couple of times without Ithaki knowing who her saviour is and then he loses her for some years. When he accidentally finds her again, always together with his brother, she gets kidnapped by a ruthless tycoon and a corrupted politician after she threatens to expose their illegal operations. Odysseus is following the traces of Ithaki trying to save her once again while being hunted by gangsters. With the help of Antigoni, a lawyer and old friend of Ithaki, he finds where she is being kept, but then things take a twist. About us
We are Alex Michelidakis and Chris Christopoulos, from Athens, Greece. We work together in a supermarket while at the same time we write at various online magazines and blogs. We came up with the story for the book while at work. We created two fictional characters, Odysseus and Ithaki, one thing led to another and before we know it we had the whole plot ready in a few days! So then we started writing. Chris has already seen some of his stories published in various literature magazines, another one, ""Our Own"" was accompanying the cd release of George Alkaios under the same name, while he has won a short film script contest with ""A Fine Day For The End Of The World"" and very recently won the award for best novelette in the Larry Niven Fantasy awards with his story ""The Fairytale"". For Alex it was the first attempt, but writing the book together worked out really well. What we need and what you getEvery little help from you counts and will bring us closer to our goal. Together we can make it happen as you can see at the end of the trailer we shot, showing one characteristic scene of the book.A small samplePrologueHe ran until his injured body sent his brain a clear 
mesage that it was pointless to go on. He only had moved a few blocks 
away from 
the appartment he was shot, standing now in a small square fortunately 
alone. That was good. He didn't want
 to be seen like this, covered in blood, what would he 
say? He sat on a bench to regain his power and to put his messy 
thoughts in some kind of order. He took a deep breath, filling his 
nostrils with the aroma of the trees and flowers surrounding him, and 
that made him feel a little better. It was that time again, the magic hour before day gave place to night that always fascinated him. The sky was covered with
 a purple, dreamy color that filled Odysseus with hope. Hope
 that anything could happen. And so much had happened lately, 
especially in the last few hours, that it was hard for him to handle. 
Everything that so far was defining his reality proved an illusion, forcing 
him to review his whole life as he knew it.His head was still aching like hell, both internally (even if the fading was gone) and externally. The first bullet found him on the surface, right besides his 
right ear, but still was causing him an intolerant, unpleasant dizziness. 
The second one had hit him on his left side where the bleeding may had 
eased, but was draining the remaining energy left on his body. He
 tried to stand on his feet but felt so weak.
There wasn't a place he could go, a shelter to hide until 
he could recover. His appartment was being watched and in a hospital he 
should give some good answers about his situation, something that 
would cause him further troubles. He knew he should keep running but 
that seemed a huge task to achieve, so he just leaned on the bench. 
Maybe that was it he thought. Besides, he had fulfilled his mission, 
getting a reward that all these years he could only dream of. So if this
 was supposed to be the end, let it be, he wouldn't mind...and in greek..
Έτρεξε
μέχρι το ταλαιπωρημένο κορμί του να δώσει εντολή στον εγκέφαλό του πως δεν
αντέχει άλλο. Δεν είχε απομακρυνθεί παρά μόλις μερικά τετράγωνα, όμως ένοιωθε
ότι ήταν μάταιο να συνεχίσει. Είχε φτάσει σε μια μικρή πλατεία, άδεια από
κόσμο. Ευτυχώς. Δεν ήθελε να τον δουν σε αυτή την κατάσταση, γεμάτο αίματα, τι
θα έλεγε; Έκατσε σε ένα παγκάκι να ανακτήσει λίγο τις δυνάμεις του και να βάλει
σε μια σειρά τις μπερδεμένες σκέψεις του.
Πήρε
μια βαθιά ανάσα, γεμίζοντας τα ρουθούνια του με τις ευωδίες των δέντρων που τον
περιτριγύριζαν, κάτι που τον έκανε να αισθανθεί λίγο καλύτερα. Ήταν εκείνη η
μαγική ώρα λίγο πριν η μέρα δώσει τη θέση της στη νύχτα που ανέκαθεν τον
γοήτευε. Ο ουρανός είχε πάρει μία παραμυθένια, μενεξεδιά απόχρωση που τον
γέμιζε ελπίδες πως όλα μπορούν να συμβούν. Κι είχαν γίνει τόσα πολλά τον
τελευταίο καιρό, ειδικά τις τελευταίες ώρες, που του ήταν δύσκολο να τα
διαχειριστεί. Είχαν ανατραπεί όλα όσα μέχρι τότε προσδιόριζαν την πραγματικότητά
του, κάνοντάς τον να αναθεωρήσει τη ζωή του όπως τη γνώριζε ως τώρα.

Το κεφάλι του εξακολουθούσε να τον πονάει, τόσο
εσωτερικά (αν και οι διαλείψεις είχαν σταματήσει) όσο και εξωτερικά. Η σφαίρα
τον είχε τραυματίσει επιφανειακά, ακριβώς δίπλα στο αυτί, δεν έπαυε όμως να του
προκαλεί μία ανυπόφορα δυσάρεστη ζαλάδα, ενώ και η αιμορραγία στο πλευρό του
από τη δεύτερη σφαίρα είχε κοπάσει κάπως, του αφαιρούσε όμως και τις τελευταίες
ικμάδες ενέργειας που του είχαν απομείνει. Έκανε μία προσπάθεια να σηκωθεί,
όμως ένοιωθε τόσο αδύναμος. Δεν είχε άλλωστε κάπου να πάει, ένα καταφύγιο για
να προστατευτεί μέχρι να αναρρώσει. Το σπίτι του το παρακολουθούσαν, ενώ στο
νοσοκομείο θα έπρεπε να δώσει εξηγήσεις για την κατάστασή του, κάτι που θα του

</h3> <p></p>
<p>Established
in 1970, Glad Day Bookshop is the world’s oldest LGBTQ bookstore and Toronto’s
oldest surviving bookstore. In 2012, a group of 23 community members pooled
their funds and bought Glad Day Bookshop to save it from closing. <br/>
<br/>
Since 2012, Glad Day Bookshop book sales have increased by 30% (bucking the North
American trend that saw book sales drop 25% in the same period). However,
revenue streams like DVDs, erotic photo books and magazines have still been
dropping while the cost of doing business continues to rise. We have been going
into debt every year, so our choice is clear:

</p>
<p><b><span>We need to
move it or lose it!</span></b></p>
<p>Our best
strategy for survival is adding new revenues streams like food and drink –
which means a larger space. We’ve picked out a great spot on Church Street that
would allow us to be a bookstore &amp; coffee shop during the day and a bar at
night. It is wheelchair accessible, with an accessible washroom. It has a cute
patio, a small space for performances and walls for art. </p>
<p>We will be a
space where everyone feels welcome, sexy and celebrated. We will be a queer-owned, indie place on
Church Street. We will amplify the love, creativity, sexuality, diversity &amp;
liberation that Glad Day Bookshop is known for.</p>
<p>It’s not
going to be easy – but it’s going to be fabulous.<br/><i>And we can
do it together.<br/><br/></i>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465451243/more_about_Glad_Day_gtc5wj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>In the last
4 years, Glad Day Bookshop has hosted over 700 author &amp; performer
appearances at over 160 events. We’ve been able to pay over $27,000 to authors
&amp; artists for their participation at events. We have had over 125
volunteers log in over 14,000 hours making us an important cultural and
community hub; with more funds and more space we can expand the vital role we
play in many people’s lives.</span></p>
<p>In 2013, we
launched an online bookstore, which has over 1800 titles, including eBooks.</p>In 2015, we launched the Naked Heart Festival, which is already the largest and
most diverse LGBTQ literary festival in the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465451414/faq_yij5v6.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<br/><i>How much money do you actually need?</i><br/>We actually need over $200,000 for this move. It will cost over $120,000 for the equipment, materials, supplies, renos and licensing to set up this coffee shop and bar. It will cost over $30,000 for first and last month's rent. The other $50,000 would be needed for other set-up costs, paying off some bookstore debt and having a prudent fiscal buffer. <br/><br/><i>Are there other ways to help financially?</i><br/><b>Yes! We are also looking for 'Angel Investors'.</b> An Angel Investor is someone who is willing to lend us money at low or no interest rate.

</div></div>","The Big Move
 
Established
in 1970, Glad Day Bookshop is the world’s oldest LGBTQ bookstore and Toronto’s
oldest surviving bookstore. In 2012, a group of 23 community members pooled
their funds and bought Glad Day Bookshop to save it from closing. 

Since 2012, Glad Day Bookshop book sales have increased by 30% (bucking the North
American trend that saw book sales drop 25% in the same period). However,
revenue streams like DVDs, erotic photo books and magazines have still been
dropping while the cost of doing business continues to rise. We have been going
into debt every year, so our choice is clear:


We need to
move it or lose it!
Our best
strategy for survival is adding new revenues streams like food and drink –
which means a larger space. We’ve picked out a great spot on Church Street that
would allow us to be a bookstore & coffee shop during the day and a bar at
night. It is wheelchair accessible, with an accessible washroom. It has a cute
patio, a small space for performances and walls for art. 
We will be a
space where everyone feels welcome, sexy and celebrated. We will be a queer-owned, indie place on
Church Street. We will amplify the love, creativity, sexuality, diversity &
liberation that Glad Day Bookshop is known for.
It’s not
going to be easy – but it’s going to be fabulous.And we can
do it together.



In the last
4 years, Glad Day Bookshop has hosted over 700 author & performer
appearances at over 160 events. We’ve been able to pay over $27,000 to authors
& artists for their participation at events. We have had over 125
volunteers log in over 14,000 hours making us an important cultural and
community hub; with more funds and more space we can expand the vital role we
play in many people’s lives.
In 2013, we
launched an online bookstore, which has over 1800 titles, including eBooks.In 2015, we launched the Naked Heart Festival, which is already the largest and
most diverse LGBTQ literary festival in the world.
How much money do you actually need?We actually need over $200,000 for this move. It will cost over $120,000 for the equipment, materials, supplies, renos and licensing to set up this coffee shop and bar. It will cost over $30,000 for first and last month's rent. The other $50,000 would be needed for other set-up costs, paying off some bookstore debt and having a prudent fiscal buffer. Are there other ways to help financially?Yes! We are also looking for 'Angel Investors'. An Angel Investor is someone who is willing to lend us money at low or no interest rate. You can email erickson@gladdaybookshop.com for more information.How does the names-on-things work?You choose what name gets put on something. They need to be the names of people. Some people might want to choose names that are important to them, as a gift for someone or as a way for our community to remember someone. The reason we can't guarantee the names on tables will be there for more than two years is because we might change our set-up by then but the names will stay on the tables until the tables change.How does this move fit with what the community has asked for?Over 350 people filled out our survey on moving.

<p><b>An
excerpt...</b></p>
<p><i>Is there a right way to react to a diagnosis such as MND?</i></p>
<p><i>All I can say is it is not like it is in the stories.
 I'm no hero; I don't have some magic way of knowing how to do everything
right in the worst of situations.  The shock produces so many effects on
you and you are not in full control of yourself.  I often had the eerie
feeling of watching myself going through it all from a slight distance as
though it was happening to someone else or like I was watching it as a movie or
as though I had ceased to exist and was a just a shadow amongst a world that no
longer made sense.  I knew it was really happening to me, but it is an
overwhelming situation, so many emotions all clamouring to have first place in
line, including that demon denial that still wants to convince you that it will
all go away if you just refuse to accept it and hide your head in the sand.</i></p>

<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>I have always believed that if there is a problem, there
is a solution.  If there is no solution,
then you don't have a problem, you have a fact. 
I desperately wanted my husband’s health issue to be a problem!  But what I had to face was that his disease
was a fact, and the only problems we would be able to find solutions to were how
to live the rest of our time together to the fullest and how we could make the
most of whatever we have on every day we have it, and try to keep him as
comfortable as possible as it progressed.</i></p>

</li>
<li>I have been self-employed for 25 years with experience in being responsible for my goals and objectives</li>
<li>I hold qualifications in project management</li>
<li>I have chosen a professional editor I feel I can trust</li>
<li>I will update every backer on milestones as the editing
     process unfolds so all who back this campaign will be aware of any hurdles
     being encountered</li>

longer made sense.  I knew it was really happening to me, but it is an
overwhelming situation, so many emotions all clamouring to have first place in
line, including that demon denial that still wants to convince you that it will
all go away if you just refuse to accept it and hide your head in the sand.





I have always believed that if there is a problem, there
is a solution.  If there is no solution,
then you don't have a problem, you have a fact. 
I desperately wanted my husband’s health issue to be a problem!  But what I had to face was that his disease
was a fact, and the only problems we would be able to find solutions to were how
to live the rest of our time together to the fullest and how we could make the
most of whatever we have on every day we have it, and try to keep him as
comfortable as possible as it progressed.




YOU can allow this book to get through the expensive editing process so that everyone can benefit!

After interviewing prospective editors I have secured
     one that understands and is in tune with my writing goals
A trial edit has been conducted and an estimate of
     costs delivered allowing me to create a budget. (see below for budget
     challenges)


A
little about the monster
MND (Motor Neurone Disease) is known
as ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) and Lou Gehrig’s disease in the US.


In Australia two people are diagnosed
with this disease every day and two people die from the disease every day.  

In the US a person is diagnosed every 90
minutes.


Diagnosis is a family-wide situation
as everyone close to the person who has the disease is going to be affected for
the rest of their lives. 



MND occurs in all countries of the world. It does not
     discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity or demographic. 
Over 350,000 of the world’s people are living with MND
     and over 100,000 people die from MND every year. 
MND is not a disease of ageing and can affect adults at
     any age, although the peak age of onset is during the fifties and sixties.

In 2015 there is still no known cause
for this disease and no cure.



Just what would I get if I choose a perk?

EARLY BIRD eBOOK.  
Receive the very first release of
the eBook, hot off the virtual press and be the first person in the world to
read this story.  Published in all formats so you can receive the format of your choice to suit your eReader, including PDF.


SOFT COVER COPY OF THE BOOK – A personally signed copy with hand written message of
thanks.  Only purchases here in this campaign will be hand numbered and
signed by me.  If this is being purchased
as a gift I will be very happy to hand write a message of your choice to the
recipient.  Why is the book worth this much?  The book currently sits at around 470 pages

message and signature, makes this book a collectors edition and helps ensure
the book will be published out to support many thousands of people in the
future.

Sample postcard




MENTOR SUPPORT. (Australia)  Using
either Skype or phone I will provide a mentoring session to discuss any caring
issue you choose.  The topic of
these sessions is totally up to yourself.   Could you help someone in need by providing this support?  Sessions can be conducted ANY TIME after the campaign ends, you don't have to wait for the book to be published!


GOLD SPONSOR.  You will
receive a full page in the book including your name and a personal message of
your own experience with terminal illness and the value of support to carers
and family will be printed in the book. PURE GOLD!
Risks
& Challenges
The biggest challenge relates to how long the editing
process may take until the book is ready to publish.  Absolute commitment has gotten me this far
and I believe the following points minimise the risk to an acceptable level.


The best way to overcome the risk that I miss my target is for you to choose a perk that suits you NOW

I have been self-employed for 25 years with experience in being responsible for my goals and objectives
I hold qualifications in project management
I have chosen a professional editor I feel I can trust
I will update every backer on milestones as the editing
     process unfolds so all who back this campaign will be aware of any hurdles
     being encountered

COST BREAKDOWN



Indiegogo charges 4% of the total IF my
campaign reaches its target.


If it doesn’t reach the target, then I pay 9%
of the total


PayPal will charge a 4% fee for every perk
claim they process, but at least 8% of the
total is fees.


The postcards (check perks) need to be printed
professionally and posted.


The soft cover book has fees for printing and
postage.


I’ve worked long
and hard to ensure that I could receive a maximum margin to pay for the editing whilst offering great
perks.  Hopefully I found this balance
with my perk offering and you understand that you are not just buying a book
off the shelf, but you are providing the means for this book to be available
for others who need this support right now.

<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This is my paraphrase of a quote by <b>Tom Peters, the New York Times Best Selling Co-Author of ""In Search of Excellence"", ""The Circle of Innovation""</b> and other bestsellers. It's from a PBS special commenting on the <b>research done by Professors Robert and Michele Root-Bernstein</b>.  I don't remember the exact wording; but this is the heart of it:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>""The history of innovation, discovery and great projects is that they come from the wrong people, at the wrong time, from the wrong industry, with the wrong credentials doing the wrong thing, for the wrong reason with little to no credibility, woefully short on funding, who ask the wrong questions, keep asking until they get some right answers, then do whatever it takes to do the impossible... And that is the heart and source of almost all progress...""</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Wow! Are you and I qualified or what???</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Join with us today to discover what we can do... </b></p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><br/></p>
<div>My task is to make certain I'm not needed. </div>
<div>Let's <b>create new teams</b>: </div>
<div>* Achieve based on what we know...</div>
<div><b>* Explore based on what we learn...</b></div>
<div>* Innovate based on our mistakes...</div>
<div><b>* Network to discover what we don't know...</b></div>
<div>* Network to reach others and their talents, experience, and networks...</div>
<div><b>* Create Wisdom of Crowd WiKi's and other tools to tap into the magic of our combined wisdom, skills, experience, and imagination...</b></div>
<div><b><br/><br/>I read James Suroweicki's ""The Wisdom of Crowds"" to discover where he had gone wrong in his thinking that crowds were a source of wisdom... Whoops! I was wrong again... </b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>That doesn't mean that committees, bureaucrazies, and politics work. They don't work.</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>The Free Market is the only example of democracy that has lived up to its promise in history. <b>The Free Market</b> is based on Individual Freedom which is a necessary condition to access collective wisdom. </b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>All other democracies have attempted to replace individual freedom with a ruling elite who create monopolies, disaster, and wars.</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b><b>Suroweicki's</b> book reveals effective ways to tap into the Skills, Experiences, Knowledge, and Wisdom of Crowds that can produce incredibly accurate &amp; beneficial results. </b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>We can create X-prizes and freedom to help those whose visions we do not, cannot, or will not see nor understand...<br/><br/>(X-prizes are effective prize offers that allow our individual genius to run without a central planning authority or arrogant boss micromanaging brilliance to death. See wikipedia or do a search to learn more about x-prizes.)</b></div>

<div><b>And we need teachers, video creators, writers, bloggers, an inner wisdom council experiment, public speakers, healers, researchers, and - of course - heroes, heretics, and mavericks. </b></div>

<p><b>Politics don’t work. Are you looking for solutions better than begging politicians to quit running, ruling, and ruining our world?</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As you’ve probably realized, it’s the politicians and political elite who profit from wars and get us into them. Their method of getting out is generally destroying another country or losing so much they can no longer get people to tolerate their continuing stupidity of killing others and destroying their communities.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Politicians use the wealth we created peacefully to fund madness, mayhem, and wars.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The only way</b> <b>wealth is created is peacefully. Once created it is stolen, extorted and conned from its creators by a ruling elite and used to keep us all in chains. </b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Politicians, monopolies, and the ruling elite will never be the best solution to problems they cause.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We must find better strategies and tactics than begging for Freedom.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Let’s do a quick look at the bad news about EMF… Later we’ll explore:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>There is Good EMF as well as Bad EMF…</strong></li>
<li>The benefits of our EMF protection…</li>
<li><strong>Can we reduce Bad EMF or convert it to Good EMF?</strong></li>

<div><b>As founder, it's my responsibility to find the support we need to expand our World Healing Circles World Peace &amp; Healing project. </b></div>
<div><b><b><br/></b></b></div>
<div><b><b>No matter what, we will keep going. We will learn from mistakes, ask questions, and test different options. </b><br/></b></div>
<div><b><b><br/></b></b></div>
<div><b><b>We work with whatever we have. We'll tap into our group wisdom. </b></b></div>

<div><b><b>I have successfully generated millions of dollars for an energy healing company using live and recorded seminars over the phone and online. </b></b></div>
<div><b><b><br/></b></b></div>
<div><b><b>I have produced live seminars successfully as well and a few flops.</b></b></div>
<div><b><b><br/></b></b></div>
<div><b><b>That's why we will start with phone, online seminars, and DVD recordings. They work really well without the expenses and financial risks of live programs in hotels. </b></b></div>
<div><b><b><br/></b></b></div>
<div><b><b>We will share the power of Energy Healing Technologies to help people release stress (Which typically allows the body to more effectively deal with pain and many types of illness).

<div><b>Aside from the ruling elite and their lapdogs, who is going to ignore our need to create world peace without more violence? </b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Who is against our World Peace &amp; Healing Project?</b></div>
<div><b>*  Obviously those who refuse to look through our telescopes and/or think we're nuts... </b></div>
<div><b>* Those who benefit from wars or monopolies... </b></div>
<div><b>* Politicians addicted and corrupted by Power Over Others... </b></div>
<div><b>* A Political Elite whose ignorance is exceeded only by their arrogance...</b></div>
<div><b>* The 1% ruling elites who thrive on unearned wealth... (There are those in the 1% who will likely help us. Some are not afraid of a level playing field with a higher standard of living and opportunity for all.) </b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>We can help the power addicted discover better ways to feel good about themselves than destroying the lives of everyone else... </b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>We help victims who have swallowed propaganda that everyone should rule the lives of those they don't know and that no one should rule themselves.</b></div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<div><b>Our project starts with what we know. </b></div>
<div>Not everyone will agree with us. But for those willing to look through telescopes, we will find things others never will. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We will question, investigate, and test what we learn. </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>We can discover and reach a tipping point to change our worlds. </b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Imagine changing our worlds by innovating with and testing weird and wonderful technologies to explore the many worlds of possibility that await us.</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Imagine our WHC Member Cards as being quantum cell phones... A cell phone is connected to almost anyone in the world once we learn how to turn it on, dial, and the correct contact code.</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Our WHC Member Cards and other tools are always on and connect us to each other through our Power of Imagination ""In and Through All the Names for Love.""</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We are creating a Morphic Field for Healing and Peace which people can contribute to and use with any Energy Healing Technology. </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>The more benefits we reveal, discover and use, the more we can accomplish. </b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We each and all benefit from each person linking through World Healing Circles to <b>Send and Accept Love In and Through All the Names for Love... </b>
</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Our WHC technology is a tool to link us together with <b>energy healing technologies, </b>member cards, pendants, and lights, while they protect us from harmful EMF. </b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Anyone can demonstrate harmful EMF effects for themselves by following our Do It Yourself EMF Testing Videos. </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Can we counteract the negative effects that microwaves have on our food? </b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Can we prove it?</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Can we provide demonstrations of the beneficial effects of treating our water and food with Love?</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>The short answer is ""Yes."" </b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>How do we know? Because others have successfully used identical or similar technologies and demonstrated testable results. </b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We're not alone in using the discoveries we're talking about. We are exploring how we can be the most effective. Whether we're most effective or not, we all win if someone succeeds.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The meditation project is seeking <b>Another One Billion Dollars</b> to support 40,000 meditators, to have at least 8,000 meditators meditating nonstop in shifts in a temple to be built in India.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If they succeed... Wonderful. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We still continue to provide the other benefits that goes with our technology as we explore the many ways we can help each other and our worlds.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>WHC will expose the concept of government by gun as lunacy. </b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b style=""background-color: initial;"">People instinctively yearn for freedom even if they don't understand why freedom works.</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Today few people understand that abundance, health, unfettered opportunity, innovation, justice, inner peace, and world peace are created best by individual freedom and its core of personal responsibility. </b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Individual Freedom means an end to slavery, and the unearned transfer of the wealth and innovations we create as we are bled to feed the 1% uber rich maniacs.  </b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>WE can show people that they can reduce or transform negative emotions, memories, and sources of stress in just a few minutes a day through the weird and wonderful worlds of quantum entanglement, morphic resonance, and love; by helping others do the same.  </b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>We have tools that can help people heal hurt, fear, and hate. </b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>We succeed to the extent we can help each other.</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>This project is about us... Those who volunteer to actively participate and those who help us get started by choosing their Heroes, Heretics, and Mavericks Perk Package, like us &amp; share us with others.</b></div>

<b><div><b><br/></b></div>WHC Reveals ""How To</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b> Do It Yourself EMF Testing"" </b>to verify that EMF Harms you and our WHC Technology Protects You from ElectroMagnetic Fields:</span>
</div>
<div><b>* EMF Decreases your strength by 30%, </b></div>
<div><b>* EMF Decreases your flexibility by 30%,</b></div>
<div><b>* EMF Sabotages your sense of balance...</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Your WHC Member Card, Pedant, or Laser will protect you from these and other harmful effects... Research the problems with EMF for yourself...</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<h3>You Filter Your Air For House Dust... What About Dangerous EMF/ELF Electromagnetic Radiation?</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>We have a limited supply of the crystal pendants left. When we run out, we will switch to circular medallions made of stone that works well with our technology.</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Our WHC Member Cards provide the same EMF protection and quantum linking for world healing. Each of our tools has slightly different <b>levels of benefit, </b>characteristics, and ways to use them; but, they all work.</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>A small percentage of people appear to be immune to the effects of EMF; just like there were some people with natural immunity to other plagues. </b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<b>If you take this next step to test what EMF does to you, you are a leader... It's that simple. Leaders go first. </b>

<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p>Wars make incredible amounts of money for our ruling elites, monopolies &amp; cartels.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Wars provide opportunity to accumulate more power for those addicted to power and its perversions. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The ruling elite can use a pittance of their vast resources to create propaganda and reward the cults of critics and skeptics who protect the status quo from voices of dissent, unbridled competition, innovators, heroes, heretics, and mavericks. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We all live in police states. A police state is any country with the power to take your property, take away your choices, create public and private monopolies that they protect from competition and liability... And these governments will send men with guns if we don't do as instructed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The ruling elite claim: ""Rulers are righteous and those who don't honor them are evil."" </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The ruling elite are Not righteous. We, the dissenters, are not evil. We (Heroes, Heretics, &amp; Mavericks) are a Cure without violence, hate, and tyranny.</p>

Hi. My name is Don Winfield for World Healing Circles World Peace Project & Thank You so much for looking through our telescopes. We'll explain what telescopes have to say about you in our videos. 
World Healing Circles - How & Why We Can Create World Peace - Explore Our Show & Tell Videos 

Why so much information? 
Because, we all have different personality types…
* Some just want the big picture and that’s enough to make a decision…
* Some just want to decide if I have done my homework to decide whether or not to participate… They don't want to know what I know. They just want a feeling of whether or not I know what I'm talking about and how passionate I am for our project...
* Some look at the recommendations of who is endorsing WHC; family, friends, and others… This isn't a perfect method. But it serves people very well; because, we don't have time to decide everything for ourselves. 
* And some want to recreate my discovery process to make their own decision or to explore other possible uses or ways to improve on what we're doing…Explore the amount of information that's right for you... So, who else wants peace, tolerance, & freedom without seeking global tyranny as the cure? Review as much information as you need to decide to join us to promote world peace, receive EMF protection, and increase our ability to heal ourselves & each other... Pick a Perk Pack, Join, Like Us, Share...We want: Contributors, Promoters, Participants, Participants, Participants, and those who want to help us along by getting their hands on some of our goodies. Contributors get lifetime memberships with technology that:* Protects from All Sources of EMF (ElectroMagnetic Fields)...* Protects our members And their loved ones from EMF...* Marketers can offer these EMF Protecting Lifetime Memberships with EMF Protecting Member Cards as free bonuses to their new clients or sell them to their existing members... WHC offers our Memberships with EMF Protecting Member Cards at deep discounts to other organizations as a major part of our outreach strategy & tactics... See our Nicola Tesla Perk Pack  * Lifetime World Peace Promoting Memberships with EMF protecting Member Cards provides great gifts for your loved ones... * Equal to or outperforms all other devices costing hundred$ to thousand$... * Affordability... 10 Lifetime Memberships with EMF Protecting Member Card(s) for $55. Similar technology sells for $99 to $1,209 each that protect just one person... * And it links participants to our World Healing Circles to discover, explore & learn ways to counteract stress to activate your body's natural healing systems...Your WHC Pendant, Medallion, or your humble WHC Membership Card helps protect you from all sources of EMF radiation... See our Do It Yourself training video to test any device for yourself.First explore how and why we can create World Peace and Heal Each Other... Benefit today while reducing the senseless violence on our planet when you Pick Your Heroes, Heretics, & Mavericks Perk Pack. World Peace - Why We're HereI stumbled across an announcement - that I thought was wonderful... but could be another internet hoax - about an experiment to reduce local violence. This experiment has now been successfully replicated in 50 different cities and 2 different wars. 
Experiments and results have been published in 28 peer reviewed scientific journals.
One project with lead researcher Dr. John Hagelin (Harvard Trained 
Quantum Physicist) in 1993 was overseen by a review board of 27 scientists and public leaders. The spokesman for the District of Columbia Police Department verified the surprising results in DC and appeared as a co-author to the study.

Please watch our videos to discover how I explored the results for myself and how we can reduce violence and create a tipping point for world peace that's more effective, easier, and cheaper than other methods... Plus we promote the missing ingredient...    

How can we create peace and lower violence when politicians can't? (Do wars & violence increase political power, perks, prestige and personal profits? Do beneficiaries of war scheme for more wars?)

How can we outperform the DC Peace Project using untrained volunteers? 
Won't we be criticized by all those expecting the political elite, police, armies, spying on everyone, and monopolies (who profit from war) to stop wars, terrorism, and violence? Probably.   
""If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."" Isaac Newton

To paraphrase Pogo, ""We have met the solution and it is us!""
We can view our worlds from the shoulders of many, many giants who are exploring undiscovered possibilities... 

Please watch our videos, share and join.  
If you and I aren’t willing to challenge our beliefs of
what’s possible, we are doomed to live in a reality of
our own self created limitations... 
Can we change our worlds for the better without wasting time with politics or trying to use violence to reduce violence? 
World Healing Circles Part 1 - Create World PeaceWorld Healing Circles Part 2 - Create World Peace
World Healing Circles Part 3 - Create World Peace
World Healing Circles Part 4 - Create World Peace
You, me and a small crowd of volunteers have the power to change the world. We have at least 3 non-violent approaches we can use until one works...Read on to discover more about your power and our power together... I've forgotten the exact wording for this quote. 



This is my paraphrase of a quote by Tom Peters, the New York Times Best Selling Co-Author of ""In Search of Excellence"", ""The Circle of Innovation"" and other bestsellers. It's from a PBS special commenting on the research done by Professors Robert and Michele Root-Bernstein.  I don't remember the exact wording; but this is the heart of it:



""The history of innovation, discovery and great projects is that they come from the wrong people, at the wrong time, from the wrong industry, with the wrong credentials doing the wrong thing, for the wrong reason with little to no credibility, woefully short on funding, who ask the wrong questions, keep asking until they get some right answers, then do whatever it takes to do the impossible... And that is the heart and source of almost all progress...""



Wow! Are you and I qualified or what???

Join with us today to discover what we can do... 
   What We Need & What You Get 
My task is to make certain I'm not needed. 
Let's create new teams: 
* Achieve based on what we know...
* Explore based on what we learn...
* Innovate based on our mistakes...
* Network to discover what we don't know...
* Network to reach others and their talents, experience, and networks...
* Create Wisdom of Crowd WiKi's and other tools to tap into the magic of our combined wisdom, skills, experience, and imagination...
I read James Suroweicki's ""The Wisdom of Crowds"" to discover where he had gone wrong in his thinking that crowds were a source of wisdom... Whoops! I was wrong again... 

That doesn't mean that committees, bureaucrazies, and politics work. They don't work.

The Free Market is the only example of democracy that has lived up to its promise in history. The Free Market is based on Individual Freedom which is a necessary condition to access collective wisdom. 

All other democracies have attempted to replace individual freedom with a ruling elite who create monopolies, disaster, and wars.

Suroweicki's book reveals effective ways to tap into the Skills, Experiences, Knowledge, and Wisdom of Crowds that can produce incredibly accurate & beneficial results. 

We can create X-prizes and freedom to help those whose visions we do not, cannot, or will not see nor understand...(X-prizes are effective prize offers that allow our individual genius to run without a central planning authority or arrogant boss micromanaging brilliance to death. See wikipedia or do a search to learn more about x-prizes.)

And we need teachers, video creators, writers, bloggers, an inner wisdom council experiment, public speakers, healers, researchers, and - of course - heroes, heretics, and mavericks. 


Heroes, Heretics & Mavericks Perk Packs Provide Tools to Help Us Heal Each Other While Creating World Peace


WHC provides benefits to you and other volunteers who take time each day to help themselves by helping others...

Imagine the possible consequences of living in an energetic world where EMF (ElectroMagnetic Field) is growing by leaps and bounds...


Almost everything harmful is dose dependent. Our bodies can handle some amount of almost anything. But too much can be deadly; either quickly or over time.

On our website you will find research results on the harm from EMF Radiation from the US Air Force, US Navy, NASA, videos examining EMF problems in depth, Dr. Magda Havas and many others. WHC provides do it yourself demonstrations so you can test yourself, and more. 

World Healing Circles Part 5 - Create World Peace



Politics don’t work. Are you looking for solutions better than begging politicians to quit running, ruling, and ruining our world?

As you’ve probably realized, it’s the politicians and political elite who profit from wars and get us into them. Their method of getting out is generally destroying another country or losing so much they can no longer get people to tolerate their continuing stupidity of killing others and destroying their communities.

Politicians use the wealth we created peacefully to fund madness, mayhem, and wars.

The only way wealth is created is peacefully. Once created it is stolen, extorted and conned from its creators by a ruling elite and used to keep us all in chains. 

Politicians, monopolies, and the ruling elite will never be the best solution to problems they cause.

We must find better strategies and tactics than begging for Freedom.

Let’s do a quick look at the bad news about EMF… Later we’ll explore:

There is Good EMF as well as Bad EMF…
The benefits of our EMF protection…
Can we reduce Bad EMF or convert it to Good EMF?
How we can use EMF to Heal Each Other…
How can we use EMF as another tool to create Lasting World Peace…


Meet Dr. Magda Havas - 



These studies aren't new. Many of the US Military studies documenting the harm from device created EMF were competed in the 1970's before we had: 
Wifi HotSpots, 
More Cell Phone Towers than you can count,
Helpful in home EMF broadcasting wifi products to remove the clutter of too many cables and cords, 
So-called smart meters, 
Ipads, 
A world with 6.8 billion mobile phone service contracts in a world of 7.3 billion people... (Many people have more than 1 contract)
TV's, 
Computer screens, 
Hair dryers, 
Fluorescent lights 
And too much else to mention...



Did you know that; Your mind and heart broadcast good EMF Radiation?


Not All EMF Radiation Is Bad!  

EMF Radiation can be Good!

Our Featured World Healing Circles Indiegogo Heroes, Heretics, & Mavericks Dr. Royal Rife perk package offers: WHC LifeTime Tier 1 Membership with a Member Card, a Crystal Pendant, and a Heart Light LED Laser, and any of these help counteract BAD EMF Radiation from all sources... 

These tools help us link to each other where we share our imagination, intention, and heart fields to release stress. Stress release can kickstart our natural healing abilities. 

We can transform fear and hate which are 2 of the necessary foundational building blocks politicians need to create wars, unearned profits, monopolies, and more power.

What if we don't reach our goal?

All perks packs get delivered... Whatever amounts we receive will go first into advertising, promotions, and contests to promote our blog - WorldHealingCircles.com - and WHC membership packages.  

Our WHC blog is foundational; because, 

An effective blog can fund our growth, 
Our WHC Blog provides posts, articles, & surveys to attract new participants, 
Our WHC Blog provides a location for training,
Our WHC Blog can host our open source PIPS training to Heal Each Other,

Our WHC Blog provides an opportunity to receive feedback, 

Our WHC Blog is our home to tap into The Wisdom of Crowds,
WHC starts with whatever we have to learn & build...


We Stretch Fund to launch additional projects using our weird & wonderful technology which increases participation.

We promote as many reasons as possible for people to use our technology multiple times each day; because, growth of users & frequency of use helps all of us.  

If we only get partial funding, it will support, promote, & advertise our World Healing Circles blog... Pay for perk fulfillment... Begin online seminars...

We need a steady stream of blog posts, videos, contests, quotes, and interviews to help our site create viral traffic.

This is a video from our hosting company. We are following their training:



A successful blog creates cash flow for expenses... We seek talent with passion... We sponsor contests and x-prizes to continue our growth... We contract research and experiments. 

As founder, it's my responsibility to find the support we need to expand our World Healing Circles World Peace & Healing project. 

No matter what, we will keep going. We will learn from mistakes, ask questions, and test different options. 

We work with whatever we have. We'll tap into our group wisdom. 

I have successfully generated millions of dollars for an energy healing company using live and recorded seminars over the phone and online. 

I have produced live seminars successfully as well and a few flops.

That's why we will start with phone, online seminars, and DVD recordings. They work really well without the expenses and financial risks of live programs in hotels. 

We will share the power of Energy Healing Technologies to help people release stress (Which typically allows the body to more effectively deal with pain and many types of illness). We will introduce energy healing programs like PIPS, EFT, THC, Matrix Energetics, Quantum Touch, Body Code, & others.

We provide support that others can use to outperform what we've done.

There are many groups who will work with us.

Aside from the ruling elite and their lapdogs, who is going to ignore our need to create world peace without more violence? 

Who is against our World Peace & Healing Project?
*  Obviously those who refuse to look through our telescopes and/or think we're nuts... 
* Those who benefit from wars or monopolies... 
* Politicians addicted and corrupted by Power Over Others... 
* A Political Elite whose ignorance is exceeded only by their arrogance...
* The 1% ruling elites who thrive on unearned wealth... (There are those in the 1% who will likely help us. Some are not afraid of a level playing field with a higher standard of living and opportunity for all.) 

We can help the power addicted discover better ways to feel good about themselves than destroying the lives of everyone else... 

We help victims who have swallowed propaganda that everyone should rule the lives of those they don't know and that no one should rule themselves.

We are reaching a tipping point for World Peace with Individual Freedom by refusing to support violence, tyranny, monopolies, cartels, and wars.


If you're like me, you once believed in the systems of power over others until time and circumstance awoke each of us. Most of our opposition are just not as far on their educational path... And we don't need them. It's not our task to educate. 


We are surrounded by incredible abilities, skills, and experiences of others which can create miracles for us all if we can help them get started and remove the stumbling blocks created by the control freaks, monopolies, and political elite.

WHC is a tool to create World Peace, Healing, & Miracles...

WHC provides you tools to protect you & your loved ones from EMF... But these same tools can be used to link us and do far more than simple EMF protection.

We repeat, what we are doing is weird and wonderful, and may appear a bit magical; but, we have the ability to demonstrate for ourselves whether or not our results are all in our heads or are having an impact on our worlds, our stress levels, our health and inner peace.

We want to thank H. Kopp-Delaney for allowing WHC to use his wonderful creation the ""Art of Healing"" above. 
To me the boy is pointing to the Heart of Our World... The Heart is surrounded by an energy field that links us all...

The Impact


Our project starts with what we know. 
Not everyone will agree with us. But for those willing to look through telescopes, we will find things others never will. 

We will question, investigate, and test what we learn. 

We can discover and reach a tipping point to change our worlds. 

Imagine changing our worlds by innovating with and testing weird and wonderful technologies to explore the many worlds of possibility that await us.

Imagine our WHC Member Cards as being quantum cell phones... A cell phone is connected to almost anyone in the world once we learn how to turn it on, dial, and the correct contact code.

Our WHC Member Cards and other tools are always on and connect us to each other through our Power of Imagination ""In and Through All the Names for Love.""

We are creating a Morphic Field for Healing and Peace which people can contribute to and use with any Energy Healing Technology. 

The more benefits we reveal, discover and use, the more we can accomplish. 

We each and all benefit from each person linking through World Healing Circles to Send and Accept Love In and Through All the Names for Love... 


Our WHC technology is a tool to link us together with energy healing technologies, member cards, pendants, and lights, while they protect us from harmful EMF. 

Anyone can demonstrate harmful EMF effects for themselves by following our Do It Yourself EMF Testing Videos. 

Can we counteract the negative effects that microwaves have on our food? 

Can we prove it?

Can we provide demonstrations of the beneficial effects of treating our water and food with Love?

The short answer is ""Yes."" 

How do we know? Because others have successfully used identical or similar technologies and demonstrated testable results. 

We're not alone in using the discoveries we're talking about. We are exploring how we can be the most effective. Whether we're most effective or not, we all win if someone succeeds.

The meditation project is seeking Another One Billion Dollars to support 40,000 meditators, to have at least 8,000 meditators meditating nonstop in shifts in a temple to be built in India.  

If they succeed... Wonderful. 

We still continue to provide the other benefits that goes with our technology as we explore the many ways we can help each other and our worlds.

WHC will expose the concept of government by gun as lunacy. 

People instinctively yearn for freedom even if they don't understand why freedom works.

Today few people understand that abundance, health, unfettered opportunity, innovation, justice, inner peace, and world peace are created best by individual freedom and its core of personal responsibility. 

Individual Freedom means an end to slavery, and the unearned transfer of the wealth and innovations we create as we are bled to feed the 1% uber rich maniacs.  

WE can show people that they can reduce or transform negative emotions, memories, and sources of stress in just a few minutes a day through the weird and wonderful worlds of quantum entanglement, morphic resonance, and love; by helping others do the same.  

We have tools that can help people heal hurt, fear, and hate. 

We succeed to the extent we can help each other.

This project is about us... Those who volunteer to actively participate and those who help us get started by choosing their Heroes, Heretics, and Mavericks Perk Package, like us & share us with others.


Here's a bit more about projects I've worked on.

""Don has great vision for marketing projects; both the physical product and the affiliated advertising that that goes with it. 

Don is always looking to appeal to the customer and looks for novel approaches that combine excellent product and good value. 


I worked with Don to put together a start-up program that eventually sold to thousands of customers.""

""Don's scientific approach to our joint venture campaigns was refreshing, as not many self-professed 'marketing gurus' actually practice what they preach, and take the time and focus to analyze what works and what doesn't. 

Of the many large databases my company at the time, LiveOutLoud, partnered with to market to, Don's had the highest conversion ratio, as his science pays off, as did his realistic portrayal upfront of what he had to offer. 


I highly recommend Don to anybody looking for a marketing strategy and subsequent campaigns that will produce measurable and predictable results.""

""I did the demonstration tests myself and also with others to prove to myself and to others, that I gifted this crystal to, that it actually works.  It proved that electromagnetics, such as my cell phone, affected my balance, strength and flexibility in a negative way.


I even sleep with my Shield.

Thank you, Don for such a beautiful crystal and for making me feel safer in this vast world of electronics!!""

To the extent anything is done that you like, it is because of those I have learned from. Anything you don't like is probably because I'm still learning.

EMF Electromagnetic Fields, Can we use them to help us?
WHC Reveals ""How To Do It Yourself EMF Testing"" to verify that EMF Harms you and our WHC Technology Protects You from ElectroMagnetic Fields:

* EMF Decreases your strength by 30%, 
* EMF Decreases your flexibility by 30%,
* EMF Sabotages your sense of balance...

Your WHC Member Card, Pedant, or Laser will protect you from these and other harmful effects... Research the problems with EMF for yourself...


You Filter Your Air For House Dust... What About Dangerous EMF/ELF Electromagnetic Radiation?

We have a limited supply of the crystal pendants left. When we run out, we will switch to circular medallions made of stone that works well with our technology.

Our WHC Member Cards provide the same EMF protection and quantum linking for world healing. Each of our tools has slightly different levels of benefit, characteristics, and ways to use them; but, they all work.

A small percentage of people appear to be immune to the effects of EMF; just like there were some people with natural immunity to other plagues. 

If you take this next step to test what EMF does to you, you are a leader... It's that simple. Leaders go first. 


Frequency Shield is a name for one of the same products we use. We also call them WHC Pendants & Medallions. You can do the Twister Test by yourself and do the other two demonstrations with a friend.  (Note - On the toy soldier test, best testing is done with feet together.)



You are taking steps to create a legacy of peace, abundance and freedom for your children's children. Let's replace today's unending war, tyranny, violence, fear, hate, and protected monopolies. Politicians are selling our children's children into debt slavery. Our children and generations to come are being stuck with the bill to pay for the insanity of our ruling elites.  

You are one of the creators of our World Healing Circles and an end to an insane political elite.

   Risks & Challenges

Wars make incredible amounts of money for our ruling elites, monopolies & cartels.

Wars provide opportunity to accumulate more power for those addicted to power and its perversions. 

The ruling elite can use a pittance of their vast resources to create propaganda and reward the cults of critics and skeptics who protect the status quo from voices of dissent, unbridled competition, innovators, heroes, heretics, and mavericks. 

We all live in police states. A police state is any country with the power to take your property, take away your choices, create public and private monopolies that they protect from competition and liability... And these governments will send men with guns if we don't do as instructed.

The ruling elite claim: ""Rulers are righteous and those who don't honor them are evil."" 

The ruling elite are Not righteous. We, the dissenters, are not evil. We (Heroes, Heretics, & Mavericks) are a Cure without violence, hate, and tyranny.

We win anyway...

We are choosing to open source PIPS (Power of Imagination Paradigm Shift) 

The ruling elite have created hamster cages for anyone who wants to create a better world for all... Hamster cages protect the power and unearned riches of the elite by exhausting our time, money, and creativity pursuing dead ends until our voices fade in the distance. 

We (you, me, & our circles) are letting people out of their hamster cages... 

Even the elite will benefit from individual freedom for all... I suspect a world without wars, monopolies, and power over others terrifies them.

Through WHC, we use both open source and off-the-shelf energy healing technologies. There are many other existing healing energy organizations for us to work with... 

We are exploring the many ways to improve how we use science to expand our abilities. 

We are tapping into the Wisdom of Crowds with surveys, Wisdom of Crowd WiKi's, X-Prizes, Contests, and opportunities for others to get involved however they wish.

We are networking with others and creating our own competition as we go.   

WHC is a Child of Individual Freedom, Personal Responsibility for our worlds, and the Magic that comes from Freedom, Curiosity, and Opportunity combined with our willingness to explore beyond other people's boundaries... And our own limitations! 


   Other Ways You Can Help 
I have been in situations where I wanted to help financially and could not. Your situation and your commitments may limit your choices. Help by liking our website and sharing us with your networks.

Indiegogo provides sharing tools... Use them. 

Get on our mailing lists to explore the ways you can help create world peace, and help us all help and heal each other. Like us and share...  And that's all there is to it...We are building web pages about our Heroes, Heretics, & Mavericks. Pick a perk pack... Funding Priorities -First Dollars of funding will focus on creating traffic to our blog; because,* With sufficient traffic the blog becomes self-sustaining... We expect to spend up to $100 a day on average to buy traffic for 120 days until the campaign generates enough to increase our budget.  ($12,000.)Why 120 days? It takes several weeks to discover which ads work best, and ramp up to $100 daily then beyond. Revenues could come from advertisements for alternative healing, organic foods, filters, etc., WHC is paid 3 weeks after the previous month closes...Our Indiegogo campaign pays 15 days after after our first 30 day stage is completed. So it will take 45 days before we can promote using combined strategies & tactics.Therefore, we're planning for 120 days as a conservative date to begin to receive cash flow from our blog campaigns...* We need our blog for outreach, teaching, and communicating with our participants...* Our blog site provides us opportunities for videos, quotes, articles, surveys, contests and more. Some will create different levels of viral traffic and eventually a few viral home runs...* We will spend money for writers, videographers, presentation creators for the blog... $10,000 over 120 days... Plus initial Contests or X-prizes of $1,500... WHC will contract a virtual assistant... $4,000 for 120 days...Money is needed for infrastructure, hosting, online seminars & training, online services, software, hardware, ect. We need to add to our current inventory, prepackage with identification (SKU's), and setup with Amazon to handle our fulfillment... $7,000... We have initial and monthly expenses for website, support services, & training... WHC is an activity... Our Blog Website Tech Team and Hosting is $2,000 front end and $97 per month... Plus we may need to add 1 or 2 separate sites for a membership sites ($500) and our WiKi ($1,600). We have $2,700 allowed for unexpected & expensive, and $3,175 for tech support, seminar hosting tools, and other support technologies or training. And we pay Indiegogo & PayPal a percentage for providing this opportunity.Our stretch goals will accelerate our growth, then switch to specific projects for life extension, healing our honey bees, and other programs where our technology, wisdom of crowds, open source projects, and morphic field creation may be beneficial to all...

Our PayPal account is ""Liberty Marketing Network, Trust, Don Winfield, Trustee"" PayPal requires a notice.

""When offering rewards you must:List the type of rewards you’re offering in exchange for each donation amount.Include a disclaimer on your campaign site and marketing material that you will make a best effort to provide the reward but delivery is not guaranteed.""... PayPal


I think this is new. I don't recall seeing the statement in other campaigns.

 Tell
me why you seek by going to places.                                                                                      Tell
me why peace is not painted on your walls.
  Tell
me why people die in segregated zones.                                                              Tell me why peace does not fill your homes.

Part 1 - DLT
  Maybe
they do not know or have not yet discovered.                                                      The magic is in you and it surrounds you.                                                                                   I invite you to my party if you want to attend.                                                                         Just take off the blindfold and be transported.                                                               Write the script of your life, it is time to film it.                                                                 Because
you are the star of your life.                                                                                           And

 The
peace is within you. Looking costs nothing.                                                       Take
off the mask. Race and social class are not admitted here.                               To
be happy you don’t need material things.                                                                  It

in the end we are all equal.                          We

effort we overcome the problems.

Calle Paz y Respeto - a story of transformation 
(Peace and Respect Street)

 






October, 2012 - Ibarra, Ecuador - Barrio Alpachaca 


Rival gangs each lose a friend to violence. The gang leaders have learned that exacting revenge traps them in the brutal cycle of fear, pain and tragedy. It is no longer an option. 
I am working in the prison of Ibarra, Ecuador with the successful Peace Education Program (PEP). A special meeting is arranged with gang leaders to introduce these videos about the peace process.  Something clicks and we begin to meet weekly to watch more video and talk things over. 
Inspired gang members march in the local Alpachaca civic parade for the first time. Their self-elected banner reads ""Peace is not only possible, it is inevitable"". Local authorities stand and clap to see such a vital statement coming from these notorious youth.






2013 -To facilitate their transformation process, five leaders are hired part-time through the foundation I direct. An initial project develops antidrug/bullying/self-esteem programs that are presented in twenty regional high schools. These upbeat, multimedia, interactive presentations come from the personal experience of the gang leaders. It is youth to youth and the students really listen.








  '13 - CPR sponsors a major event for World Peace Day, Sept. 21st. Over 2,200 area students march and enjoy a followup music festival.



   


 

2014 - Now with an office and gaining credibility, the Calle Paz y Respeto (CPR) team wins $10,000 from the Ecuadorian Ministry of Culture in a national contest to design and promote a cultural festival.  CPR stages a successful event - ""Hip Hop for Peace"" - in their tough neighborhood Alpachaca that features live music, graffiti and dance, all with messages of peace and well-being.



   


   '14 - CPR team members maintain their gang leader status and work from within the organization. A Peace Accord is reached and signed between rival gangs. This courageous and effective pact is honored and holds to this day, serving as a model for other gangs to follow.




    '14 - An international film crew spends two weeks with the CPR team and local gang members gathering material for a film documentary about the personal transformations of these marginalized youth. Entitled ""Peace is Inevitable"", the one hour film is slated to open in Film Festivals and for 2016 it is planned to be a feature on Discovery Channel Latin America.

                            
    '14 - CPR begin to write and record ""consciousness"" hip hop songs.


                            



2015 - An audio recording studio is installed in the CPR office.     


    '15  -  Calle Paz y Respeto team writes, edits and produces a 1/2 hour radio program broadcast weekly over National Public Radio, RPE. It is the first national ""urban sound"" program dedicated to peace and well-being. 
    '15  - This weekly broadcast ""REACCIONA"" has a growing national audience of est. 160,000. The CPR team receive specialized training in radio production from the audio technicians at Radio Publico Ecuador.


   '15 - CPR coordinates a first-ever Summer Arts Camp for children of their tough neighborhood Alpachaca.


Transformation           
Each Calle Paz y Respeto  team member has embraced a new optimistic perspective. They continue to serve as gang leaders, but now as role models for their peers in choosing a positive path for life. 
The message of peace that these young people promote via their national radio broadcast, their in-school programs, public events, community outreach and children's arts activities has generated a significant impact in Alpachaca, Ibarra and in Ecuador.


The Impact


Their active and courageous choice to stop the violence and to practice peace has positively affected members of their local gang and other challenged youth in nearby cities.
Their weekly urban-vibe radio show reaches thousands of marginalized youth throughout Ecuador with a positive message of well-being.
Their in-school presentations have inspired students, school psychologists, teachers and authorities to learn more about youth challenges and how to support positive change.
Their personal success, dedication and ongoing training is a model of transformation for Latin American youth.



 







The PEACE IS INEVITABLE 
Indiegogo campaign is about keeping this model project alive and growing thru 2016 and beyond.


It's about sharing with challenged youth a working example of productive choice. 
It's about taking off the mask and embracing one's innate inner resources.
It's about accepting the possibility of peace.


As a co-sponsor you are part of an innovative initiative that will reach thousands of youth in Ecuador, the Americas and the world. 

Plans for 2016 are in motion......

Strategy for 2016



CPR's successful national radio program will expand to a one-hour weekly broadcast. 
The ground-breaking, hour-long documentary ""Peace is Inevitable"" about personal transformation to peace will be released in Latin America, the US and internationally. Its impact is expected to generate major interest in the peace process for challenged youth.
A digital ""how-to"" package  about the unique peace process will be prepared and provided to all those wanting to know more; whether  responding to the documentary film, the radio show or any other CPR initiative. 

A national tour targeting youth in Ecuador's cities and impoverished zones will feature the ""Peace is Inevitable"" documentary plus Grupo Calle Paz y Respeto live onstage with their hip-hop songs, messages of peace and inspired interactions with the audience.

Job training and the creation of a productive micro-enterprise for other members of the gang (association).
The purchase of additional audio gear for CPR's in-office recording studio.
The first stages towards developing a Cultural Arts Center in Alpachaca to offer dance, music, theater and creative arts workshops to disregarded children and youth.

Basic salaries, office supplies, rent, materials and mobility expenses.

Recent meetings with the regional Ministry of Culture, the Board of Education, both the Senator and Governor of Imbabura Province and local NGO's have generated additional support for CPR program logistics, materials and technical assistance.

If we don't reach the campaign goal, we will apply all funds raised to keep Calle Paz y Respeto alive and well for as long as possible. 
And this campaign will continue thru 2016 via Indiegogo's generous ""in-demand"" option. 
It's time to invest in human dignity, in human potential, in the power to choose clarity and peace.


Risks & Challenges

Grupo Calle Paz y Respeto will continue technical training to constantly improve the quality of their national radio broadcasts,  in-school presentations and administrative capabilities.

The fact that funds are channeled to a third world country via a private US account may deter investment, even though the credibility of the staff, the program and the donation process are reliable, proven and endorsed.


 Indiegogo's ""in-demand"" status will enable ongoing donations as the project progresses and expands.


It is vital to train other young people in radio production and the logistics of developing and delivering social assistance.

2008-'15 - Director, Fundacion Montanas de Esperanza, Ecuador 
2011- present - Director, Vibrant Village Foundation -Ecuador
2012 - present - Project Coordinator for Grupo Calle Paz y Respeto

As Director of two foundations in northern Ecuador, I have been the legal representative and fiscally accountable for over 6 years, effectively managing and investing over 1.2 million dollars into specific social service projects. I have successfully worked with grants from Rotary International, the Prem Rawat Foundation and the Vibrant Village Foundation. Our model initiatives to improve quality of life for Andean families and youth have garnered accolades from many regional social service organizations and the Ecuadorian government.
 
The Peace is Inevitable project is an innovative and vital program for supporting marginalized youth in self-discovery and recovery. Thank you for recognizing and reacting.

<h3></h3>
<p><b>Origine du projet</b></p>
<p>Il y a dans
ce pays des églises qui se réunissent dans des lieux non conformes à ce que le
monde pourrait accepter. Le lieu de culte d'Ampanataovana à Antsirabe en
est un de ceux-là.</p>
<p>Le toit en
tôle ondulé est rouillé.<br/>
Les portes et fenêtre en bois sont souvent vandalisées pour voler le matériel à
l'intérieur car il n’y a pas de volets de sécurité.<br/>
La sonorisation est inexistante.<br/>
Les bancs sont sans dossier en planches de coffrage.<br/>
Le sol n'est pas carrelé.<br/>
Il n'y a pas de terrasse pour que les membres s'abritent du soleil et de la
pluie à la sortie.<br/>
Il n'y a pas de toilettes.<br/>
Il n'y a pas d'eau courante.<br/>
Etc. . .Etc. . ..La liste est longue. . .. <br/>
<br/>
Ce lieu de culte a un grand besoin de rénovation car, encore le mois dernier,
un tremblement de terre est venu agrandir les craquements des murs et du sol.<br/>
Le mur du côté gauche est sur le point de tomber, comme vous pouvez le
voir sur les photos dans la galerie.</p>
<p>Chaque euro que vous allez donner, sera pour eux d'une grande importance.<br/>
<br/>
Si vous êtes ici, c'est parce que le sort de nos frères et sœur vous intéresse,
donc ne ressortez pas de cette page sans faire un geste pour eux.

<br/><br/></p>
<p><b><span>Nos besoins</span></b></p>
<p>Pour la
reconstruction, nous avons besoin d'un peu d'argent.</p>
<p>Ne vous y
trompez pas, si nous demandons 7500€, c'est le montant total pour la
reconstruction et l'aménagement nouveau de ce lieu.</p>
<p>Le coût de
la construction n'est pas très élevé.<br/>
1€ = 3200MGA (Ariary Malagasy)<br/>
Donc les 7500€ = 24 000 000 000MGA <br/>
Le salaire d'un ouvrier du BTP est de 180 000MGA<br/>
<br/>
Un bâtiment comme celui qui est souhaité nous prendra environ 3mois de
construction avec 4 ouvriers du BTP et des membres d'église qui vont pouvoir
aider à côté. Soit un coût de : 2 160 000MGA<br/>
C'est très important que les membres puissent aider dans ce projet. Car ce lieu
sera le leur.</p>
<p>
Une brique à un coût de 80MGA <br/>
L'ensemble du bâtiment c'est environ 20 000 briques soit : 1 600 000MGA<br/>
Un moellon à un coüt de 150MGA<br/>
Il faut de 750 moellons soit : 112 500MGA.<br/>
<br/>
Les plus importants coûts seront : </p>

Tout cela en plus du bâtiment lui-même et la construction des toilettes.</p>
<p>C'est donc
pour cela que nous avons pris un montant un peu plus important que ce que vous
pensez que nous aurons besoin vu le coût.</p>
<p>Nous
reconstruirons totalement l'édifice et l'aménagerons de façon moderne et
sécurisé. </p>
<p>Le début des travaux est prévu pour le début du mois de Juin de 2016. A cette période c'est l'hiver Austral et donc la saison sèche. La meilleure saison pour la construction.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Fin de programme</b><br/></p>
<p>En fin de
programme, s'il reste de l'argent sur ce qui a été reçu, nous l'utiliserons pour
aider d'autres églises dans le besoin, car il y en a beaucoup dans ce cas.<br/>Il y existe dans la ville, une association d'aide aux enfants et jeunes en difficultés tenu par le pasteur de l'église francophone qui a des besoins financiers permanents.<br/><br/></p>
<p><b><span>Utilisation de l’argent </span></b></p>
<p>Afin d’améliorer
la vie de cette congrégation, nous ne reconstruirons pas à l’identique le lieu
de culte, mais nous ferons un vrai bâtiment à deux niveaux.<br/><br/>
Au rez-de-chaussée nous disposerons des salles pour l’école du Sabbat des
enfants, une grande salle de réunion des JA et les toilettes.</p>
<p>Au niveau 1, accessible à toutes personnes, y compris celle à mobilités réduites, il y aura
une salle de préparation du culte et de réunion pour les officiants, un wc pour
personnes à mobilités réduites, et la grande salle de réunion des membres d’église
capable de recevoir 120 personnes environ.</p>
<p>Dans les
salles du bas, nous y placerons des chaises pour les enfants selon leurs âges.</p>
<p>Dans la grande
salle de l’étage, nous ferons fabriquer des bancs dignes du lieu où Dieu lui-même
vient à la rencontre de son peuple.<br/>
Dans la salle de réunion, il y aura aussi des chaises et une table afin de
réunir le comité et autre réunion de la direction de l’église.</p>

Kristen has been teaching art to young people for over a decade and leading fundraising campaigns for young people and students in developing nations.

You can read more about the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books 2016 and what you will help fund, here:Los Angeles Times Festival of Books 2016 - Exhibitor SalesBeyond reaching our $2500 goal, we would like to use excess funds to
Donate 1 copy of the book to the main public library in the 
capital of each of the 50 states in the USA so that it is available in 
the library system for any child who wishes to borrow it to read. We 
will donate alphabetically by state.
Give free copies of the book to girls ages 6-12 at book signings and other events
Finally, if there are enough funds, we (Barrett and Kristen) could use them to reduce our transportation costs (airfare) to Los Angeles for the fair

The perks we are offering will be many, such as a handwritten note of thanks, a signed PDF, an autographed illustration, coupons for free enrollment in online writing or art courses.If we do not reach our basic goal, all that we do get will still be put towards renting a booth at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books 2016.The Impact

 Both Kristen Palana and I have spent many years opening our hearts to people and giving of ourselves. We live out the motto ""be the change you want to see in the world"". I have been active in children and youth organizations for decades (Campfire Boys and Girls and YMCA) and teaching various subjects like English and culture in countries such as Guatemala, Dominica and Denmark. Kristen has been teaching art to young people for over a decade and leading fundraising campaigns for young people and students in developing nations. ""Service"" is both our middle names!Now you can be a part of this collaborative creative project with Kristen and me and make a significant impact in the lives of girls.    Risks & Challenges  The risk we face is that we will not get the money to go to the book fair. In that case we will need to fund it ourselves.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Imagine yourself as a passenger in an airplane.  And, in a split second, all hell breaks loose and the airplane crashes to the ground.  And, through the drama and breathlessness of it, you realized that you are the only survivor.  People say that walking away from an airplane crash is surviving it.  That's just the beginning.  You can be spared physical.  But the emotional paralysis is the psychological trauma of it.  Escaping death is one thing.  Getting your life back is quite another. <br/><br/>As a survivor of child abuse, I was barely hanging on to life with the effects of post traumatic stress dominating my life.  Then, at the age of 23, a miracle happened.  I was nearly killed in a single engine airplane crash in which the other two on board were killed.  I've  written my story of life and tragedy to show why this airplane crash, that I was in, was a miraculous event for reclaiming my life. </p>

<p>I have created this book editing campaign to raise funds to pay for comprehensive book line editing for my forthcoming autobiography, <i><strong>Crash And Turn</strong></i>.  It is about the drama and breathlessness of the airplane crash, the trials and tribulations that led me to that tragic point, and it is about how I broke the psychological shackles that had prevented me from going after her dreams.  It is a story of true grit. . . . a romantic and spiritual journey. . . great soul, gut-wrenching stuff to hold onto.  I've learned a lot of valuable life lessons through my traumatic experiences and I am passionate about teaching other trauma survivors how they can survive life too.</p>
<p>I have written a manuscript about my turbulent life of child abuse, my young adult life of turmoil, and my survival of a deadly airplane crash.  With the help of your contribution to my book editing campaign fund, I will be able to pay for the professional comprehensive book line-editing of my manuscript and continue on this awesome journey of telling my story.   With a published book, I will be able to teach the principals of Having A Survivor Instinct to a wider audience.  I want to make a difference in other people's lives at my online business at: <b><i>Survivor Instinct Unlimited, LLC</i></b>  <a href=""http://www.survivorinstinct.com/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.survivorinstinct.com/home.html</a> . </p>
<p>I have been working long and hard on my autobiography book project as well as my Survivor Instinct eBook series and my Survivor Instinct audio book series.  This has become my life's passion to share my story of surviving my own life's adversities and to give other trauma survivors some tools that they can use to develop a Survivor Instinct.  God has given me life and has given me a powerful story to reach out to other people who are looking for a solution to heal the wounded human spirit. </p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>My Reach-out For Inspiration</strong>
</h3>
<p>I am so passionate about my airplane crash book project that I have reached out to America's ""Hero on the Hudson"", Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who saved all 155 passengers and crew members aboard a disabled airplane that he crash-landed onto the waters of the Hudson River.  At a San Francisco author luncheon and speaking event, I described to Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, my own harrowing airplane crash survival.  I told  Captain ""Sully"" of the miracle that happened when I was nearly killed in a single engine airplane crash in which the other two on board were killed.  And I thanked Captain ""Sully"" for saving all of those people on board his airplane.  I told Captain ""Sully"" that just by the fact that I saw him save all of those people, on board his airplane, made me feel that he saved me. <br/> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are millions of people, around the world who are living a life of quiet desperation.  They are looking for an answer to heal the wounded human spirit.  I've started this campaign to help me to continue with my life's purpose of reaching a wide audience with my message of hope.  I want to teach the principles of <i><b>Having A Survivor Instinct</b></i>  to other trauma survivors of life's adversities.  I would like to achieve this through my forthcoming autobiography and through my trauma survivor products at:<br/><a href=""http://www.survivorinstinct.com/products.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.survivorinstinct.com/products.html</a><br/><br/>I feel that we all have worth.  We all have value.  Each one of us has something to offer this world.  And when you know that, you will be a better person for it.<br/> </p>
<p><b>These are some of the ways your contribution will help make a difference in other people's lives:</b><br/><br/>I feel that my airplane crash book project is valuable to many of the contributors of my autobiography book editing fund because they will be helping me to make a positive difference in many trauma survivors' lives.  With the help of my contributors, my ultimate goal of having my autobiography published will help many trauma survivors to live again.  These awesome survivors can learn, through my autobiography, about my break through events that had helped me to achieve success, happiness, and the personal creativity that I wanted.  The many readers, of my Survivor Instinct products , can also learn that they are in control of what goes into their minds.  They can learn to tap into motivational material to help them to clear their minds of negative ideas.  This can help them to start making lasting positive changes in their own lives after their traumatic experiences.  With a published book under my belt, it will give me the credentials that I need.  These credentials will afford me many more speaking opportunities where I can reach out to a wider audience with my message of becoming a <strong><i>""Survivor""</i></strong>.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have come a long way since I've started my book project.  Even though I've had physical and financial challenges along the way toward my ultimate goal of having my autobiography published, I have built, within me, the determination that has gotten me to a position closer to publication. <br/><br/>Through my classical music training in childhood and as a young adult, I've learned some very important qualities and life virtues that I'm drawing upon to keep me driving forward with my book project (focus, challenge, integrity, responsibility, confidence, dedication, and determination).  My brilliant music professors, at the University of California at Berkeley, and my fellow music classmates, friends, and colleges have greatly supported me along the way toward the publication of my autobiography.  My experience in classical music has formed, fashioned, and shaped my engagement in my writing.  It has strengthened my self-discipline in my writing and in my determination to be a published author.</p>

<br/><br/><br/>During the emotional pain that I was suffering, as an abused child and as an emotionally wounded young adult, I was able to channel all of my emotions through the music and it saved my life.  My strong classical music background has helped me to build inner strength.  Through my 14 years of music study, my 7 years of playing my violin in the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra ( age 17 to age 23), and my four years of music teaching experience has helped me to survive some of life's adversities. I've  learned the importance of focus, challenge, integrity, responsibility, confidence, dedication, and determination.  These qualities of moral excellence, that I've learned through my classical music training, have helped me to survive the many years of child abuse and also the aftermath of my tragic airplane crash accident.   These qualities of moral excellence, that I've learned, will also help me to succeed as a published author of my autobiography.  The undertakings that I have previously had <i>(some temporary physical mobility challenges and some unfortunate financial betrayals by loved ones after my airplane crash accident) </i>has just made me more determined to publish my autobiography, to share my survivor story, and to teach my survivor instinct principals to other trauma survivors.   I want to help guide other trauma survivors who feel that they have no hope.  The determination that I've built within me, as an abused child and as a violinist, has given me inner strength and has helped me to survive the aftermath of my traumatic airplane crash accident.  As they say,<b><i>""That which does not kill me, makes me stronger."" </i></b> <i><b>(Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche)</b></i>. <br/><br/>My plan for solving these physical challenges is, to not only draw energy from the beneficial qualities of my inner strength and from the encouragement from my family and friends, but to also reach out to the skilled technicians, in the literary profession, who can help me to get over the editing, publishing, and promotion hurtles that stand in the way of many writers' publishing goals.     With your financial support, I can have a wider reach of literary technicians.  These professional  experts can help me to achieve my life's purpose by editing and publishing my autobiography and by helping me to promote my autobiography to the masses.<br/> <ul>
<li>What qualifies me to overcome these hurdles is my strong determination to show other trauma survivors that they have it within them to build a survivor instinct.  By showing other people of traumatic mishaps, my own survival story, they can also become stronger, smarter, and more skillful at handling life's adversities.  I will teach these survivor instinct principles through my trauma survivor business (<i><b>Survivor Instinct Unlimited, LLC</b></i>).  And with a published book under my belt, I can open more doors to speak about developing a <i><b>Survivor Instinct</b></i>.<br/> </li>
<li>My  plan for solving these challenges is to hire skilled literary professionals to help me with the challenging steps that I face toward getting my autobiography edited and  published.  And with your contribution to my book campaign, I can achieve this.  I invite you to go on this awesome journey with me.</li>

Imagine yourself as a passenger in an airplane.  And, in a split second, all hell breaks loose and the airplane crashes to the ground.  And, through the drama and breathlessness of it, you realized that you are the only survivor.  People say that walking away from an airplane crash is surviving it.  That's just the beginning.  You can be spared physical.  But the emotional paralysis is the psychological trauma of it.  Escaping death is one thing.  Getting your life back is quite another. As a survivor of child abuse, I was barely hanging on to life with the effects of post traumatic stress dominating my life.  Then, at the age of 23, a miracle happened.  I was nearly killed in a single engine airplane crash in which the other two on board were killed.  I've  written my story of life and tragedy to show why this airplane crash, that I was in, was a miraculous event for reclaiming my life.

I have created this book editing campaign to raise funds to pay for comprehensive book line editing for my forthcoming autobiography, Crash And Turn.  It is about the drama and breathlessness of the airplane crash, the trials and tribulations that led me to that tragic point, and it is about how I broke the psychological shackles that had prevented me from going after her dreams.  It is a story of true grit. . . . a romantic and spiritual journey. . . great soul, gut-wrenching stuff to hold onto.  I've learned a lot of valuable life lessons through my traumatic experiences and I am passionate about teaching other trauma survivors how they can survive life too.
I have written a manuscript about my turbulent life of child abuse, my young adult life of turmoil, and my survival of a deadly airplane crash.  With the help of your contribution to my book editing campaign fund, I will be able to pay for the professional comprehensive book line-editing of my manuscript and continue on this awesome journey of telling my story.   With a published book, I will be able to teach the principals of Having A Survivor Instinct to a wider audience.  I want to make a difference in other people's lives at my online business at: Survivor Instinct Unlimited, LLC  http://www.survivorinstinct.com/home.html . 
I have been working long and hard on my autobiography book project as well as my Survivor Instinct eBook series and my Survivor Instinct audio book series.  This has become my life's passion to share my story of surviving my own life's adversities and to give other trauma survivors some tools that they can use to develop a Survivor Instinct.  God has given me life and has given me a powerful story to reach out to other people who are looking for a solution to heal the wounded human spirit. 

My Reach-out For Inspiration

I am so passionate about my airplane crash book project that I have reached out to America's ""Hero on the Hudson"", Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who saved all 155 passengers and crew members aboard a disabled airplane that he crash-landed onto the waters of the Hudson River.  At a San Francisco author luncheon and speaking event, I described to Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, my own harrowing airplane crash survival.  I told  Captain ""Sully"" of the miracle that happened when I was nearly killed in a single engine airplane crash in which the other two on board were killed.  And I thanked Captain ""Sully"" for saving all of those people on board his airplane.  I told Captain ""Sully"" that just by the fact that I saw him save all of those people, on board his airplane, made me feel that he saved me.

 Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger saved all 155 passengers and crew members aboard a disabled airplane that ""Sully"" was forced to crash-landed onto the waters of the Hudson River.After my own harrowing airplane crash survival, I have become very passionate about my life's purpose and about the gifts that God has given to me.  I would like to raise these book editing funds as soon as possible   I will then be able to get the professional book line-editing completed.  Then I will be able to send my manuscript back to the major literary agent who is interested in my book.  I want to reach out to other survivors of trauma and be able to make a difference in their lives through my autobiography, my eBooks, my audio-books, and through my public speaking.I hope that, through my writing, I can help other trauma survivors to be able to use new coping tools and personal growth tools to develop a Survivor Instinct.  I want to help trauma survivors to turn their lives around.

The Impact
There are millions of people, around the world who are living a life of quiet desperation.  They are looking for an answer to heal the wounded human spirit.  I've started this campaign to help me to continue with my life's purpose of reaching a wide audience with my message of hope.  I want to teach the principles of Having A Survivor Instinct  to other trauma survivors of life's adversities.  I would like to achieve this through my forthcoming autobiography and through my trauma survivor products at:http://www.survivorinstinct.com/products.htmlI feel that we all have worth.  We all have value.  Each one of us has something to offer this world.  And when you know that, you will be a better person for it. 
These are some of the ways your contribution will help make a difference in other people's lives:I feel that my airplane crash book project is valuable to many of the contributors of my autobiography book editing fund because they will be helping me to make a positive difference in many trauma survivors' lives.  With the help of my contributors, my ultimate goal of having my autobiography published will help many trauma survivors to live again.  These awesome survivors can learn, through my autobiography, about my break through events that had helped me to achieve success, happiness, and the personal creativity that I wanted.  The many readers, of my Survivor Instinct products , can also learn that they are in control of what goes into their minds.  They can learn to tap into motivational material to help them to clear their minds of negative ideas.  This can help them to start making lasting positive changes in their own lives after their traumatic experiences.  With a published book under my belt, it will give me the credentials that I need.  These credentials will afford me many more speaking opportunities where I can reach out to a wider audience with my message of becoming a ""Survivor"".

I was interviewed on the Conversations LIVE Radio Show.I discussed with radio show personality, Cyrus Webb, how I have been able to survive not only child abuse but how surviving a plane crash has changed my life as well.http://www.blogtalkradio  .com/middayconversation...              Host, Cyrus Webb 

Because I have strong focus, dedication, and determination, in sharing my message of survival, I want to show you trust in me.  I am showing you trust by demonstrating my purposefulness in my television/radio media work, in my author-speaker projects, and in my published writings. 


Risks & Challenges
I have come a long way since I've started my book project.  Even though I've had physical and financial challenges along the way toward my ultimate goal of having my autobiography published, I have built, within me, the determination that has gotten me to a position closer to publication. Through my classical music training in childhood and as a young adult, I've learned some very important qualities and life virtues that I'm drawing upon to keep me driving forward with my book project (focus, challenge, integrity, responsibility, confidence, dedication, and determination).  My brilliant music professors, at the University of California at Berkeley, and my fellow music classmates, friends, and colleges have greatly supported me along the way toward the publication of my autobiography.  My experience in classical music has formed, fashioned, and shaped my engagement in my writing.  It has strengthened my self-discipline in my writing and in my determination to be a published author.
 
Scenes From the Important Classical Music Training That Shaped My Will to Survive and That Strengthened My Writing and Speaking Skills to Lead

During the emotional pain that I was suffering, as an abused child and as an emotionally wounded young adult, I was able to channel all of my emotions through the music and it saved my life.  My strong classical music background has helped me to build inner strength.  Through my 14 years of music study, my 7 years of playing my violin in the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra ( age 17 to age 23), and my four years of music teaching experience has helped me to survive some of life's adversities. I've  learned the importance of focus, challenge, integrity, responsibility, confidence, dedication, and determination.  These qualities of moral excellence, that I've learned through my classical music training, have helped me to survive the many years of child abuse and also the aftermath of my tragic airplane crash accident.   These qualities of moral excellence, that I've learned, will also help me to succeed as a published author of my autobiography.  The undertakings that I have previously had (some temporary physical mobility challenges and some unfortunate financial betrayals by loved ones after my airplane crash accident) has just made me more determined to publish my autobiography, to share my survivor story, and to teach my survivor instinct principals to other trauma survivors.   I want to help guide other trauma survivors who feel that they have no hope.  The determination that I've built within me, as an abused child and as a violinist, has given me inner strength and has helped me to survive the aftermath of my traumatic airplane crash accident.  As they say,""That which does not kill me, makes me stronger.""  (Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche). My plan for solving these physical challenges is, to not only draw energy from the beneficial qualities of my inner strength and from the encouragement from my family and friends, but to also reach out to the skilled technicians, in the literary profession, who can help me to get over the editing, publishing, and promotion hurtles that stand in the way of many writers' publishing goals.     With your financial support, I can have a wider reach of literary technicians.  These professional  experts can help me to achieve my life's purpose by editing and publishing my autobiography and by helping me to promote my autobiography to the masses. 
What qualifies me to overcome these hurdles is my strong determination to show other trauma survivors that they have it within them to build a survivor instinct.  By showing other people of traumatic mishaps, my own survival story, they can also become stronger, smarter, and more skillful at handling life's adversities.  I will teach these survivor instinct principles through my trauma survivor business (Survivor Instinct Unlimited, LLC).  And with a published book under my belt, I can open more doors to speak about developing a Survivor Instinct. 
My  plan for solving these challenges is to hire skilled literary professionals to help me with the challenging steps that I face toward getting my autobiography edited and  published.  And with your contribution to my book campaign, I can achieve this.  I invite you to go on this awesome journey with me.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>C.L. Young aka Krazybwoy is currently incarcerated in Kentucky. Since writing him through Black &amp; Pink's pen pal program, he's also become a dear friend of mine. He and I quickly realized we had a lot in common, including a passion for activist work (Krazybwoy works tirelessly to learn about legal rights and organize for himself and his fellow prisoners) and a love of all things witchy and occult-related. About a year ago, I started sending him images from the Major Arcana (the first 22 cards of a tarot deck) and he wrote me back with his interpretations and stories about the card. In an effort to get Krazybwoy commissary money to help bring his life inside a bit more comfort and to help support his spiritual and political organizing, we decided to turn this into The Prison Arcana Tarot Zine. </p>
<p>Krazybwoy has experienced intense violence and discrimination based on his race, sexuality, and spiritual beliefs. He's been locked up in solitary three times since we've been writing (two and a half years) and more before that.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The bulk of the writing for the zine is done. I (Raechel) have also been chosen for an (unpaid) residency at The Future in Minneapolis where I will have access to a Risso printer to make the zines. We're asking for $3,000 for the initial printing and $300 to cover Indiegogo's cut from our fundraising. The money will be used to buy paper and other materials for the zines, cover postage for mailing zines, website fees, and my time at the residency. The rest of the money will go to Krazybwoy.<br/><br/>Here's the estimated breakdown: </p>
<p>$1,000: directly to Krazybwoy's commissary for his labor writing the bulk of the zine contents; he requests commissary money for basic comforts inside prison (warm socks, clean sheets, snacks, etc) and also ordering legal and spiritual resources for his organizing work (currently he has to order directly from the prison and books cannot be sent to him) </p>
<p>$1,000: Raechel's 8-day residency at The Future (where she will perform the labor to edit, write the preface, design, print, and assemble the zine). This averages to ~$15/hour during these 8 days only and does not include work prior to the residency, such as finding and recruiting an artist, building a website, etc. </p>
<p>$1,000: printing and postage supplies, initial mailings, website fees (postage and envelopes cost a ton and good paper isn't cheap either!)</p>
<p>$300: to cover Indiegogo's 5% fees + 3% credit card fees</p>
<p><br/>OTHER THINGS ABOUT MONEY DISTRIBUTION/TRANSPARENCY: <br/><br/>*We received a grant from the History Design Studio at Harvard to pay an incarcerated or formerly incarcerated artist for images for the zine. That money will go directly to the artist. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>*If we don't reach the $3,300 goal: Krazybwoy will get $1,000 no matter what, and any additional money will go to cover mailing and supply costs. Raechel will get paid last, if any money remains after supplies and postage.</span></p>
<p>*If we exceed the $3,300 goal: 70% will go directly to Krazybwoy, 20% will be donated to Black &amp; Pink, and 10% will be reserved to continue to pay the artists. Black &amp; Pink is an abolition organization that supports LGBTQIA and HIV+ incarcerated people (and the organization that first linked Raechel to Krazybwoy). </p>
<p>*After the campaign ends, money from additional sales of the zine ($20 each) will be used in the following way: to cover supplies and postage (estimated $2-3/zine),  B&amp;P donation at $1/zine, and all remaining profits directly to Krazybwoy and the artists. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will not just make a difference to Krazybwoy, but it will also positively impact all of the incarcerated people Krazybwoy aims to help through political organizing and spiritual community-building. In addition, this zine will reach any incarcerated person who is interested in using tarot as a method of healing and coping (which both Krazybwoy and I do in our own life). ""Free world"" people who read the zine will also get a better sense of the struggles experienced by incarcerated people and ideally will have a heightened sense of empathy for their struggles. Additionally, anyone who practices tarot will be able to expand their understanding of the deck through the interpretation of a marginalized person whose voice is not generally heard in the (overwhelmingly white) public witch world.</p>
<p>If you are invested in a world without prisons, we invite you to consider this project as a small step in that magical direction. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know money is tight for so many of us, so if donating isn't it the cards, we totally get it! That said, there are other (free!) ways to help support this campaign. </p>

<li>Share this on your social media and with your local community groups! </li>

C.L. Young aka Krazybwoy is currently incarcerated in Kentucky. Since writing him through Black & Pink's pen pal program, he's also become a dear friend of mine. He and I quickly realized we had a lot in common, including a passion for activist work (Krazybwoy works tirelessly to learn about legal rights and organize for himself and his fellow prisoners) and a love of all things witchy and occult-related. About a year ago, I started sending him images from the Major Arcana (the first 22 cards of a tarot deck) and he wrote me back with his interpretations and stories about the card. In an effort to get Krazybwoy commissary money to help bring his life inside a bit more comfort and to help support his spiritual and political organizing, we decided to turn this into The Prison Arcana Tarot Zine. 
Krazybwoy has experienced intense violence and discrimination based on his race, sexuality, and spiritual beliefs. He's been locked up in solitary three times since we've been writing (two and a half years) and more before that. He has made numerous attempts to gain more rights for his fellow prisoners using the legal library and attempting to get books and other organizing materials from the outside. It has proven deeply difficult. The money from this zine won't solve all of these obstacles (prisons are designed to make organizing near-impossible), but it will help a little, and for an incarcerated person, a little goes a long way. 
This zine will be completed during an unpaid eight-day residency that I've been selected for at The Future in Minneapolis, where I will have access to to a Risso printer. Part of this campaign is to raise money to support my time at the residency, but the majority of the money - and anything collected in sales after the campaign has ended - will go to Krazybwoy.

<p>We all know that childhood is a time for exploration and
adventure, but no one adheres to this sentiment more than Ellie. She may be
small. She may be the younger of the two siblings, but she has an iron will and
a persistent nature that inevitably gets her and her older brother Tom into
trouble. But what's a little trouble when you're about to do something
incredibly awesome?</p>
<p><i>Ellie and Tom:
The Secret Tree House Committee</i>, is the story of a great
summer-holiday plan to build the 'Most-Top-Notch-Secret-Tree-House ever built
on the surface of this planet’ (Ellie's words not mine!). But how will the kids
get the materials? How will they assemble it? How will they hide the plans from
those who seek to stop them, and, most importantly, how can Ellie's older and
wiser brother Tom ensure he doesn't get the blame for everything that goes
wrong, like always? So many obstacles to overcome but as always, I'm sure Ellie
has the solution—maybe not the safest or the best solution—but a solution all
the same!</p>
<p>Filled with comedy, fun and
memorable characters, this children’s story evokes a time of practical
learning, innocent fun, and youthful optimism that we all once possessed.</p>
<p><b>What
Do I Need To Make it Happen?</b></p>
<p>Why do I need help getting
additional funds? Well, here is what the items on my spectacular shopping list
are: </p>
<ul>
<li>The manuscript still needs to go through the final edit,
     done by the critical eye of my wonderful and patient, editor Dustin Schwindt . Legend!</li>
<li>Beautiful illustrations and internal design must be paid
     for to fully bring the reader’s experience to heavenly highs—and yes,
     these are proving to be more expensive than expected—but what wouldn’t I
     do for you, my lovely future reader.? :)  </li>
<li>I will also need to pay for an ISBN number (Oh, these
     administration necessities are so uncreative!);</li>
</ul>
<p>and finally… </p>

We all know that childhood is a time for exploration and
adventure, but no one adheres to this sentiment more than Ellie. She may be
small. She may be the younger of the two siblings, but she has an iron will and
a persistent nature that inevitably gets her and her older brother Tom into
trouble. But what's a little trouble when you're about to do something
incredibly awesome?
Ellie and Tom:
The Secret Tree House Committee, is the story of a great
summer-holiday plan to build the 'Most-Top-Notch-Secret-Tree-House ever built
on the surface of this planet’ (Ellie's words not mine!). But how will the kids
get the materials? How will they assemble it? How will they hide the plans from
those who seek to stop them, and, most importantly, how can Ellie's older and
wiser brother Tom ensure he doesn't get the blame for everything that goes
wrong, like always? So many obstacles to overcome but as always, I'm sure Ellie
has the solution—maybe not the safest or the best solution—but a solution all
the same!
Filled with comedy, fun and
memorable characters, this children’s story evokes a time of practical
learning, innocent fun, and youthful optimism that we all once possessed.
What
Do I Need To Make it Happen?
Why do I need help getting
additional funds? Well, here is what the items on my spectacular shopping list
are: 

The manuscript still needs to go through the final edit,
     done by the critical eye of my wonderful and patient, editor Dustin Schwindt . Legend!
Beautiful illustrations and internal design must be paid
     for to fully bring the reader’s experience to heavenly highs—and yes,
     these are proving to be more expensive than expected—but what wouldn’t I
     do for you, my lovely future reader.? :)  
I will also need to pay for an ISBN number (Oh, these
     administration necessities are so uncreative!);

and finally… 

The series’ website and all the distribution and printing
     channels must be set-up in order for this project to reach you all.

<h3>Santa's Superhero</h3> <p>Many years back in those tender days when my son was still 3, he came up with this story concept. I have been in amazement ever since. More so was what intrigued this mental creativity. </p>
<p>I am an entrepreneur and owner of <a href=""http://anythingonaclock.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anything on a Clock</a>. I have passion for helping people. This has zeroed me to this organisation, and to charity. My son Nathan, sees me as his hero and shares my life passion. This made him come up with the idea. This idea has since then captivated me and turned into a goal and ambition. We got started on the book project, but found it it was much more than just writing a book. </p>
<h3>Before the Book - Background Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Ever since Nathan was born, we would go to the CityTV Breakfast Television FoodBank Friday in Vancouver.  The first time we went, we were interviewed by host Dawn Chubai.  Shortly after Nathan was born I started a company called <a href=""http://anythingonaclock.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Anything on a Clock</a>.   After that, whenever we went to FoodBank Friday, we would donate part proceeds of our November sales to the Food Bank.</p>
<p>On December 4th, 2009, we went to the FoodBank Friday broadcast as we always had.  But this time was different.  Shortly after we arrived, a firetruck rolled in. Generally, Nathan is a bit groggy when we go to these events.  They start at 6:00 am and because we like to be there near the beginning, and then hang out for a bit, we usually leave the house around 5:00 am.  But when the fire truck arrived, Nathan got really excited.  Off camera, before our interview, Dawn Chubai asked Nathan why he was so excited.  Nathan being 3 1/2 years old at the time pointed to the firetruck and said “Super Heroes”.</p>
<p>During our interview, Dawn asked Nathan again about the firefighters and he told Dawn that they were Super Heroes.  After our spot, they cut to Riaz Meghji who did an interview about the upcoming Santa Clause Parade.  Then it was the firefighter’s turn.  While Riaz was doling his thing, host Greg Harper asked if Nathan would like to join him at the firetruck for his segment.</p>

<h3>...and so it all began</h3>
</div><div>That was the first time that Nathan connected his Super Heroes (firefighters) to Santa.  That evening when I tucked him into bed, I asked him for ideas for his bedtime story.  </div><div>He asked me “<i><b>What would happen if Santa got stuck in a chimney?  Do you think firefighters would help them?</b></i>”  </div><div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">As Christmas grew closer, he would give suggestions about how Santa got stuck in a chimney and how a firefighter came to his rescue.  Each night he would begin by giving a different scenario.  After a few nights I saw a pattern in our story telling so after he fell asleep each night, I would go to my computer and write down the story that we just made up.</span><br/></p>
<p>By Christmas, we had a lot of different adventures that Santa and his Super Hero would go on.  They would all begin the same way; Santa would get caught in a chimney and a firefighter, his Super Hero, would pluck him out of the chimney. Later that year, I found the stories on my computer and thought that I would put it into a story book for Nathan.  I wrote out the story similar to what we have today and the next year I would read it to Nathan as we got closer to Christmas instead of making up the stories.</p>
<p>Jump forward to the winter of 2014.  Christmas was approaching once again and Nathan asked me “<b><i>When are we going to make this a real book</i></b>?” I have been talking about it for the last few years but nothing came of it.  So I told him it was time we get it into print.</p>
<p>I went to my favourite online book publishing site, <a href=""http://www.blurb.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blurb</a>, and ordered my first book.  This one has no illustrations, just the story.  I did this book because I had arranged for Santa to come to my house to read the book to a bunch of kids and I wanted him to have a real book in his hands.</p>

<p>When Santa gets stuck in a chimney, a firefighter named Nathan helps to get him out.  Santa is so thankful, he asks Nathan to help them for the rest of the night.  And it’s a good thing they did.</p>

...and so it all began
That was the first time that Nathan connected his Super Heroes (firefighters) to Santa.  That evening when I tucked him into bed, I asked him for ideas for his bedtime story.  He asked me “What would happen if Santa got stuck in a chimney?  Do you think firefighters would help them?”

I went to my favourite online book publishing site, Blurb, and ordered my first book.  This one has no illustrations, just the story.  I did this book because I had arranged for Santa to come to my house to read the book to a bunch of kids and I wanted him to have a real book in his hands.
So, that is how we came up with a story about how a firefighter helped Santa when he got stuck in a Chimney.  



The Book - the story

The malls were crowded with last minute shoppers.  A blanket of snow covered the ground as the echoes of children carolling were heard through the silence of the evening.


Up at the North Pole, the reindeer were harnessed to Santa’s sleigh. The gifts were all loaded and Zippy, Santa’s head elf was waiting to help Santa with his deliveries.  It was a Christmas Eve like every other, so they thought.
When Santa gets stuck in a chimney, a firefighter named Nathan helps to get him out.  Santa is so thankful, he asks Nathan to help them for the rest of the night.  And it’s a good thing they did.
In Santa and His Super Hero, you will read about Santa’s misadventures that Christmas evening and how his Super Hero, a fire fighter named Nathan helped him out.



The Book - not just a Book
When we decided we were going to publish the book, we thought that we would like to help people with the sales of Santa and His Super Hero.  Since a fire fighter was so helpful to Santa that night, we thought that we would help the fire fighters.
Proceeds of the sale of our book will be given to the BC Professional Fire Fighters’ Burn Fund (BCPFFABF).  The Burn Fund not only helps the survivors of fires across British Columbia, they are also big on the education and prevention of fires and injuries due to fire.  Another thing the BCPFFABF does is in the summer they run a camp for children who are burn survivors.
Their new project is the Burn Fund Center.  A brand new building at main Street and East 23rd Avenue in Vancouver will be an affordable place for caregivers to stay as their loved ones are being treated for their injuries at either Children’s Hospital of the Trauma and Plastics Unit at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH).

There are a couple reasons we picked the BC Professional Fire Fighters Burn Fund.

The story is about Santa getting stuck in a chimney and a fire fighter saves him.
Later in the book they come across a chimney fire and the fire fighter puts out the fire so that Santa can safely deliver his presents.
Getting burned in a fire is often a devastating and life changing experience.  The BC Professional Burn fund does great work with burn survivors of all ages.  Please check out their website at burnfund.org for more information about the BC Professional Fire Fighters Burn Fund.

In order to be able to donate as much money as possible, we decided to do this crowd-funding.

<p>The nation needs more journalism that is written, edited, and published outside the ""coastal media bubble.” By funding <i>Belt Magazine</i>, not only will you be able to read stories about this all-important region, but you will be creating much-needed opportunities. According to a recent article in the<i> Columbia Journalism Review</i>, ""One out of every five media jobs was located in New York City, Washington DC, or Los Angeles in 2014, up from one in eight ten years prior."" We need more opportunities for journalists living in this region as badly as we need better journalism written about it. </p>
<p>And that’s what we’ve been doing. At <i>Belt</i>, local Rust Belt journalists are the ones asking the questions and writing the stories.</p>
<p>Since our launch in 2013, <i>Belt Magazine</i> has been dedicated to providing quality regional reporting and long-form journalism—and that has never been more important than it is now. The 2016 presidential election proved the importance of the Rust Belt—not just to those who live here, but to all Americans. So we’re relaunching our magazine with a stronger, more focused mission to provide the in-depth and insightful reporting and writing that the Rust Belt—and the rest of the country—deserves. </p>

<p>And when one of those major coastal media outlets said the Rust Belt merely “shrugged” during the women’s march, <a href=""http://beltmag.com/southwest-michigan-many-arent-shrugging-off-march/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">we took that on, too</a>.</p>
<p>Going forward, we’re committed to continuing that kind of coverage. And in this uncertain political era—during a time when we know that the Rust Belt is the canary in all our political, social, and economic coalmines—we're doing even more.</p>
<p>We’re going to publish long-form, in-depth articles with an even stronger focus on electoral politics, “resistance” efforts, and policies affecting the Rust Belt—including the rifts between urban and rural areas, unions, the roles of immigrants and refugees who populate the region, and lead abatement and clean water issues. (Read about that water crisis in Flint lately? Guess what—it’s not over.)</p>
<p>But to do that, <a href=""http://www.refinery29.com/2016/11/130147/rust-belt-trump-voters-election-media-issues"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">we need you on the team</a>.</p>

<p>So please, help us keep doing what we do: damn good journalism.</p>
<p>If we meet our $15,000 goal, we will be able to publish one in-depth feature per month as well as weekly coverage of Rust Belt stories and issues for the next six months. If we exceed our goal, we can get to work hiring more freelancers and planning expanded coverage.</p>

<p><u><strong>Das wichtigste im Überblick</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Wofür sammle ich Geld? </strong><br/>Mein Buch wird in einigen Monaten veröffentlicht. Der Verlagsvertrag ist unterzeichnet. Das bedeutet Ihr bekommt die <strong>Perks und Vorbestellungen in jedem Fall.</strong> Auch kann ich die gesammelten Mittel behalten. Der Erlös fliesst in das Pre-Marketing welches professionell erstellt wird. In Kombination mit dem Verlagsmarketing möchte ich so ein möglichst breites Publikum ansprechen. Ich möchte mich von der Masse hervorheben.</p>
<p><strong>Erhalte ich die Perks und Vorbestellungen in jedem Fall? </strong><br/>Ja, dass verspreche ich Dir. </p>
<p><strong>Wann wird das Buch veröffentlicht?</strong><br/>Das Datum steht noch nicht genau fest, es wird aber zwischen April und Juni 2017</p>
<p><strong>Warum soll ich helfen? </strong><br/>Weil ich mit Deiner Hilfe das Buch richtig bekannt machen kann und Du teil der Story werden kannst. </p>
<p><strong>Warum sollte ich ein Buchprojekt unterstützen, es gibt doch bereits tausende davon?</strong><br/>So einzigartig und speziell ich und meine Aktivitäten sind, so ist es auch das Buch. <br/>Nachdem Du es gelesen hast, wirst Du verstehen was ich meine.</p>
<p><strong>Ich habe leider kein Geld, kann ich Dir anders helfen?</strong><br/>Ja natürlich, teile es in Deinen Sozial-Medien, sprich darüber. </p>
<p><strong>Leider habe ich kein Pay-Pal und keine Kreditkarte, wie kann ich Dir einen Obolus geben?</strong><br/>Sende mir eine eMail, dann können wir darüber sprechen. </p>
<p><strong>Gibt es eine Leseprobe?</strong><br/>Es ist noch keine öffentlich verfügbar. Das Lektorat arbeitet daran. </p>
<p><strong><u>Und nun alles im Detail</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Wer bin ich? </strong><br/><br/>Man sagt mir nach ich sei ein Visionär und Querdenker. <br/>weiteres findet ihr in meiner Biografie: <a href=""http://www.steveschild.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.steveschild.ch</a></p>
<p>Ein Buch zu verfassen ist nicht einfach, als Familienvater und<a href=""http://www.mars-one.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Mars100 (Mars-ONE) </a>Bewerber mit einem Vollzeitjob braucht es sehr viel Energie und Zeit alles unter einen Hut zu bringen. </p>
<p>Dieses Buch entstand im Laufe von mehreren Jahren und das Manuskript ist fast vollständig überarbeitet und fertig. Ein Verlag wurde gefunden und das Buch kommt in den nächsten Monaten auf den Markt. Obschon der Verlag mein Buch verlegen und Werbung und PR machen wird, so bleibt es doch für den Verlag ein Buch unter vielen. Das soll nicht so bleiben. </p>
<p><strong>Warum?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Der Hacken an der Sache ist leider, dass der Verlag einen Druckkostenzuschuss von über 9000.- Euro verlangt welches ich nun auch bezahlen konnte. Manche mögen das kritisieren, aber ein Kollege von mir hat mehrere Bücher erfolgreich über diesen Verlag verkauft. <br/>Ich bin überzeugt das er gute Arbeit leisten wird, aber es wird nicht genug sein. Denn man muss aus der Masse herausragen. <br/><br/><strong>Wofür brauche ich denn noch eure Hilfe?</strong>
</li>
<li>

Das wichtigste im Überblick
Wofür sammle ich Geld? Mein Buch wird in einigen Monaten veröffentlicht. Der Verlagsvertrag ist unterzeichnet. Das bedeutet Ihr bekommt die Perks und Vorbestellungen in jedem Fall. Auch kann ich die gesammelten Mittel behalten. Der Erlös fliesst in das Pre-Marketing welches professionell erstellt wird. In Kombination mit dem Verlagsmarketing möchte ich so ein möglichst breites Publikum ansprechen. Ich möchte mich von der Masse hervorheben.
Erhalte ich die Perks und Vorbestellungen in jedem Fall? Ja, dass verspreche ich Dir. 
Wann wird das Buch veröffentlicht?Das Datum steht noch nicht genau fest, es wird aber zwischen April und Juni 2017
Warum soll ich helfen? Weil ich mit Deiner Hilfe das Buch richtig bekannt machen kann und Du teil der Story werden kannst. 
Warum sollte ich ein Buchprojekt unterstützen, es gibt doch bereits tausende davon?So einzigartig und speziell ich und meine Aktivitäten sind, so ist es auch das Buch. Nachdem Du es gelesen hast, wirst Du verstehen was ich meine.
Ich habe leider kein Geld, kann ich Dir anders helfen?Ja natürlich, teile es in Deinen Sozial-Medien, sprich darüber. 
Leider habe ich kein Pay-Pal und keine Kreditkarte, wie kann ich Dir einen Obolus geben?Sende mir eine eMail, dann können wir darüber sprechen. 
Gibt es eine Leseprobe?Es ist noch keine öffentlich verfügbar. Das Lektorat arbeitet daran. 
Und nun alles im Detail
Wer bin ich? Man sagt mir nach ich sei ein Visionär und Querdenker. weiteres findet ihr in meiner Biografie: http://www.steveschild.ch
Ein Buch zu verfassen ist nicht einfach, als Familienvater und Mars100 (Mars-ONE) Bewerber mit einem Vollzeitjob braucht es sehr viel Energie und Zeit alles unter einen Hut zu bringen. 
Dieses Buch entstand im Laufe von mehreren Jahren und das Manuskript ist fast vollständig überarbeitet und fertig. Ein Verlag wurde gefunden und das Buch kommt in den nächsten Monaten auf den Markt. Obschon der Verlag mein Buch verlegen und Werbung und PR machen wird, so bleibt es doch für den Verlag ein Buch unter vielen. Das soll nicht so bleiben. 
Warum?

Der Hacken an der Sache ist leider, dass der Verlag einen Druckkostenzuschuss von über 9000.- Euro verlangt welches ich nun auch bezahlen konnte. Manche mögen das kritisieren, aber ein Kollege von mir hat mehrere Bücher erfolgreich über diesen Verlag verkauft. Ich bin überzeugt das er gute Arbeit leisten wird, aber es wird nicht genug sein. Denn man muss aus der Masse herausragen. Wofür brauche ich denn noch eure Hilfe?


VISUALISIERUNG des Buches. Ich möchte euch mit Bildern und Videos zeigen, um was es in dem Buch geht. (Das meine ich mit Werbung und Marketing)
Leider ist nun mein Konto leergeräumt und als frischgebackener Vater hat meine Familie keine Freude. Damit nun das Buch auch unter die Leute kommt Bedarf es viel Werbung und Marketing das ebenfalls sehr teuer und aufwendig ist, umgerechnet 20.000 Euro fehlen mir dafür. Daher ersuche ich um eure Hilfe, ermöglicht mir mein Buch unter die Leute zu bringen, Werbung zu machen und vielleicht wird aus meinem Buch ein Bestseller?Ich habe meinen Teil gemacht, viel Geld und Zeit investiert und das Werk erscheint in ca. 4-5 Monaten überall im Handel. Helft mir, dass mein Buch kein Ladenhüter wird. Werdet Teil der Story und unterstützt mich. Meine kleine Tochter und meine Freundin sind euch dankbar. 

Ich wünsche mir das meine Tochter eines Tages sagen kann, mein Papa hat erfolgreich ein Buch geschrieben und es hat sich gut verkauft. Ich wünsche mir, dass Sie und meine Freundin stolz auf mich sind. Der Erlös der verkauften Bücher kommt zum grössten Teil meiner Familie zu Gute.

Und Sie haben einen uralten Plan.Sie wissen alles, Sie sehen alles und sie sind stark. Es hat begonnen…2017

Ein Kopf-Kino der besonderen Art. Ich versichere euch, ihr werdet das Buch mögen und die Geschichte wird euch zum Nachdenken bringen. Vielleicht verliert Ihr dabei sogar eine Träne oder habt Albträume danach.  
Mit dem Betrag den Ihr mir spendet, kann ich Werbung und Marketing finanzieren. Es ermöglicht mir das Buch optimal zu vermarkten und unter die Leute zu bringen. 
Ihr habt die Möglichkeit, eure Ideen und Wünsche im Zweiten Teil mit einzubringen.Vielleicht kann das eine oder andere in die Story eingebaut werden. Vielleicht entdeckt ihr aber auch Fehler oder habt Ideen wie es weitergehen kann.  
Du bekommst ein Buch, dass von einem Mars-One Bewerber geschrieben wurde, wer weiss was die Zukunft bringt, vielleicht gehöre ich zu den auserwählten welche den Mars besiedeln dürfen. Wenn es soweit ist, hat mein Buch unschätzbaren Wert.  

Du bekommst Motivation und Inspiration, ich bin Weltrekordhalter im Guinnes-Buch der Rekorde. Hast Du auch einen Traum? Worauf warte noch. Träume nicht Dein Leben, lebe Deinen Traum. Mein Motto: ""not even the sky is the limit"" soll Dich inspirieren.

<p>Hi! My name is Sofia Sunden. I have a background in International Politics, however I’m living in Rio de Janeiro since three years, where I teach Swedish, English and capoeira to children for a living and regularly write for the magazine Yeah Brasil.</p>
<p>I am about to embark on a great adventure – putting my faith in and all my efforts into making a dream come true. I have been working on a book since a year and a half now, about me and my life. My dream is to finish and  eventually publish my book. I believe we all have a story to tell, and I want to share mine with you!</p>
</div><div>
<p>This book spans over three continents and eight countries where I lived since I left Sweden as 18-year-old. The book is about my life and my adventures from the favelas in Rio de Janeiro to the rooftops of Dublin, via  the political corridors of the Scottish Government and the EU to becoming a Swedish, English, Capoeira teacher in Rio. </p>
<p>I began this project in 2015, however, recently  I realized I needed to do Something to get it Off the ground! So earlier this year I applied to Mastin Kipp’s MasterMind Writing retreat in Bali. (Mastin Kipp, known from Oprah Winfrey’s Super Soul Sunday, is a bestselling author, inspirational writer and  the man behind the popular Daily Love website and runs the Power and Purpose podcast). Mastin Kipp takes a number of professional writers and editors to Bali with a group of aspirational writers. With the guidance of the professional writers and inspiration by Mastin, the participants has to complete the first draft of their book within a month! The event takes place in Bali in order for the writers to exclude themselves from their normal social life and without distraction focus on their project and FINISH the draft within a month!</p>
<p>It was a lengthy application and after a long interview, I was selected to participate! I was really excited about the prospect of going to Bali and to have No Excuse but to Sit Down and Do it and FINISH MY BOOK!!</p>
<p>..only that.. I turned the offer down..!</p>
<p>WHAT!?</p>
<p>Why!?</p>
<p>Well.. as much as I felt it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, I was also concerned about my jobs here in Rio, and the financial aspects of the participation fees..  It was with a very heavy heart I turned the offer DOWN!</p>
<p>But, the whole process really lit something in me, and it made me realise how BADLY I want to Do This! Dedicate myself fulltime and whole heartedly to the project, and with help from professionals make this book as good as it possible could be!</p>
<p>And being selected, and hearing that Mastin Kipp and his team believed in me and this project, gave me confidence ..</p>
<p>So, now, I have decided to Do It Anyway!</p>
<p>I’ve heard that you don’t have to quit your job just to write a book, but it might help, right!?</p>
<p>So THAT is what I am doing! I am leaving my work in Rio for an unpaid sabbatical in Ubud,  a traditional artistic village in Bali. There I am giving myself 6 months to dedicate myself to this Project and Finish my book!</p>
<p>I am turning to you all and raising funds in order to be able to contract professional editors to work with me as soon as I have finished the first draft of the book. I am asking for your support in reaching my dream to finish my book, and with professional help make it as good as it possible could be. Even if you are unable to support me financially, feel free to think of me and send me positive vibes over in Bali, that will be very welcomed too! :)</p>
<p>I am taking a huge leap of faith here, to dedicate myself to a dream that I have had for a very long time, but why not? Perhaps we sometimes need to undertake extraordinary measures in order to receive extra ordinary results!?</p>
<p>I wish to see this fundraising as a Wishing Well, do you remember them from the fairy tales!? Where you through in a penny at the top and make a wish! Through a penny at me and my dream, and at the same time, take a moment to think about YOUR dream and what is stopping you from pursuing it..? Perhaps, that way, we can make them Both Come true!</p>

<p>In Malaysia, we often speak of the importance of racial harmony but that monologue refers mainly to the Malays, Chinese and Indians who populate the Malay peninsula. The plight of the indigenous people officially called Orang Asli hardly figures. Perhaps the fact that they make up less than 200,000 of the country’s population of 32 million means less interest in who they are. And yet, that is the tragedy. The Orang Asli in Malay means ‘The Original People’. Just like indigenous people in many other countries, they have been marginalised.</p>
<p>My project aims to document the story of the Orang Asli in Malaysia. There are many misconceptions about these people and one of the worst is that being indigenous means being primitive, and lazy. We hope to inform, alleviate misunderstanding and describe the issues facing these people.</p>
<p>Subject matter in the book will include their belief system, sustainability of their way of life, heritage loss, problems they face, and most importantly, to capture the present for posterity.</p>
<p>I plan to cover between 12 - 15 locations where the Orang Asli live throughout the Malay peninsula, which is one part of Malaysia.</p>
<p>I will be working with a team, their names I have included at the end of this section.</p>
<p>I want to challenge current stereotypes of the Orang Asli.</p>
<p>When I travelled throughout Malaysia for my first book, Book in Malaysia, in 2013, I did not have a good understanding of the Orang Asli. Like many other Malaysians, what I knew about these people were not necessarily accurate. Since then, I have been involved with a civil society organisation in Malaysia who build dormitories for Orang Asli children to facilitate their education.</p>
<p>Being in close contact with the Orang Asli, I knew then that their story had to be told. Perhaps with greater awareness of their plight, more Malaysians will take up their cause. We need people to be interested in helping and ensuring the survival of the Orang Asli.</p>
<p>Specifically, I want to show the Orang Asli to be individuals and not just numbers.</p>
<p>The book will be divided according to themes as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Diversity of the various tribes including their way of life.</li>
<li>The Orang Asli's belief system or religion.</li>
<li>Sustainability of their way of life. Traditional knowledge as a way of life.</li>
<li>Capturing the present for posterity.</li>
<li>Heritage loss.</li>
<li>How the Orang Asli were sold into slavery in the past.</li>
<li>Changing the stereotypes that exist of the Orang Asli.</li>
<li>Interview with activists, NGOs and the government body assigned to look after their rights.</li>
<li>Their future in Malaysia.</li>
<li>See the people. Not the stereotypes.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The people involved in producing this project</h3>
<p><strong>Kenny Loh</strong>, author of the book, <i>Born In Malaysia</i>, which is the result of a three-year journey through every state of Malaysia. It highlights a nation in transition and celebrates the individuals from all walks of life who have played their part in building this country. Kenny has a passion for the people of Malaysia and has spent almost ten years traveling throughout Malaysia documenting their stories for his books and website. During his travels, he has repeatedly come across the <i>Orang Asli </i>and in the majority of cases, he has found them marginalised and taken advantage of and is determined to tell their story. He currently volunteers with a civil society group which has built a dormitory for <i>Orang Asli</i> children to stay for free near schools.</p>
<p><strong>Jahabar Sadiq</strong>, founder of the online news website, <i>The Malaysian Insight</i>. His previous projects includes <i>The Malaysian Insider</i>; a highly regarded news website. He has been a journalist for nearly 30 years, of which 12 was spent as a TV news producer with Reuters Television. He has reported from a number of countries from Afghanistan in the west to East Timor in the east.</p>
<p><strong>Kamal Solhaimi Fadzil</strong> is an anthropologist with the Department of Anthropology and Sociology, University of Malaya. His research interest includes a broad range of issues dealing with minority communities, marginalization, and social inclusion. Over the last eighteen years, he has worked on several topics ranging from adolescent sexuality, stigma and discrimination towards people living HIV/AIDS, situational analysis of children in Sabah, expressions of refugees/undocumented children as residence without formal documentation, as well as with issues related to the <i>Orang Asli</i> living in protected areas.</p>
<p><strong>Allie Hill</strong> is a graphic designer and illustrator. Over the past 25 years, she has had opportunities to practice her craft in four beautiful cities: Kuala Lumpur, London, Bangkok and Singapore. Late in 2016, her work experience came full circle when her family moved back home to Kuala Lumpur. Allie’s work includes branding and communications pieces, design for packaging, books, exhibitions, typography and illustration. Allie loves art initiatives that benefit communities and strives to serve with her specific skillset. She also enjoys telling tales, and have just completed her second children’s storybook.</p>
<p><strong>Woon King Chai </strong>is a journalist based in Kuala Lumpur. He has covered some of the biggest stories in Southeast Asia for international broadcasters such as the Associated Press (AP), British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Sky News and Channel NewsAsia. His passion in telling stories of extraordinary people, cultures and places has driven him to pick up a camera and document them before they’re lost to time and memory. </p>
<p>King Chai first came across the story of the Orang Asli community when the Temiar people in Gua Musang, the largest district in the eastern state of Kelantan, were forced to build blockades on roads leading to their homes deep within the state’s rainforest reserve to put a temporary stop to logging activities. The blockades fell when state forest authorities tore down the blockades earlier this year.</p>
<p>We may bring in an additional documentary filmmaker to work on the videos.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding of USD 80,000. The funding will be used for the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>At least 10 trips to the Orang Asli villages. Funds will be used to fund transportation and accommodation costs.</li>
<li>A book will be produced and this book will require design, editing and distribution. We expect to print 3,000 copies of the book.</li>
<li>A website as we want to ensure that we reach as many people as possible.</li>
<li>This project has 6 contributors who will be photographing, interviewing, writing, editing and designing the book.</li>
<li>Funding will also be used to produce 4 thematic videos covering various aspects of the lives of the Orang Asli.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If the entire funding goal is not reached, the project will still go ahead. We may then need to revise the extent of our project or explore other sponsorship.</strong></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In Malaysia, much of what is happening to the <i>Orang Asli </i>remains unreported. Except for the news of the death of 5 <i>Orang Asli</i> children who were so afraid of being punished and bullied that the ran into the forest or the on-going case of logging on their land, there is not a general sense of apathy for their plight.</p>
<p>But just who are the <i>Orang Asli.</i> This book will attempt to answer many of these questions. I cannot stress enough how important it is that we humanise them instead of making them mere statistics. Creating this awareness will make it less easy to ignore their plight. Giving them a voice that is joined by other Malaysians will make it more difficult to silence them.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am uniquely qualified to deliver this book and the videos as I have a track record of doing so. This is not my first time publishing a book. Moreover, the contributors who will work on this project are also seasoned professionals. Their names and credentials have been listed above.</p>
<p>My track record includes the book, <i>Born In Malaysia</i>, a book about the people of Malaysia, published in 2013. The book was awarded the National Book Award by Malaysia's National Book Foundation. The book and project is now online at <a href=""http://www.born-in-malaysia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.born-in-malaysia.com/</a></p>
<p>In 2016, I photographed a book titled, <i>Seberang Perai - Stories from Across the Sea</i>.</p>
<p>In August 2017, the Malay edition of <i>Born in Malaysia</i> will be published.</p>
<p>In November 2017, I will be publishing a book titled, <i>Rags to Riches - A Story of Kuala Lumpur.</i></p>
<p>Reputations are at stake here and that is why such an accomplished team have been selected to work on this project. We do not see any major obstacles in the book being published. We are already immersed in other projects with the Orang Asli and have intimate knowledge of the locations of their villages. We have a publisher who is ready to work with us on the design and distribution of the book.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We would appreciate it if you could share this project with your friends.</p>

<h3>The 21 day challenge</h3>
<p>Historian and elusive authoress Anne O Nomis researched the Dominatrix's history over four years, and wrote the first ever work on the subject  - 'The History &amp; Arts of the Dominatrix' (2013). The book has gone on to be positively reviewed by DDI Magazine, Massad Magazine, Library Journal Review, Leatherati USA, and has become the training curriculum for Mistresses around the world.</p>
<p>Anne O Nomis is well-educated, with a Masters degree in Comparative Art and Archaeology from UCL (University College London). She hosts the ""Forbidden Book Club"" at Passionfruit, and gives talks on archaeology and history, particularly pertaining to the field of sexuality.</p>
<p>She has wanted for some time to produce a work of erotic fiction. What's stopped her is that in the last 2 years she had a baby girl, a cancer diagnosis and surgery, and lives in a country of which she is not a national and so is not entitled to any government benefits or support. As a result, she is busy working, paying for childcare and earning money for rent and expenses. When she's not busy working, she's busy looking after her daughter and doing domestic chores, leaving her very little free time. </p>
<p>She wants <strong>21 days</strong> to write a work of erotic literature.</p>
<p><strong>21 days</strong> of having a babysitter to look after her toddler daughter. </p>
<p><strong>21 days</strong> of charging up on caffeine in her favourite mocha coffee. </p>
<p><strong>21 days</strong> of a morning jog followed by solid hours of writing.</p>
<p><strong>21 days</strong> of shutting out distractions, turning her phone on silent, ignoring her email during the period of solid writing hours to solely focus on it. </p>
<p>She wants to get this work out to her fans and supporters, and to the world. She hopes to then follow the fictional erotica work with the release of her non-fiction work which has been four years in the process, on the ancient sex Goddesses of Mesopotamia, Levant and Cyprus and literature and art spanning 3000 years.</p>
<p>She has calculated that the cost to cover babysitting and coffee for 21 days to write will be AUD $185 a day x 21 days = $3885</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What her patrons and supporters will get</h3>
<p>- Confidential manuscript draft updates of her erotic literary manuscript for all supporters, and get to read her work as it progresses over 21 days. They'll also be acknowledged in her book acknowledgments if the work gets published, and receive a first edition book.</p>
<p>In addition to this...</p>
<p>- Sponsors of 1 day of her work (@ $185) will be able to have a 50 minute meeting with Anne O Nomis after she's finished her 21 days, for coffee and chat, and enable her to express her gratitude for their support. If the supporter is overseas, Anne is happy to arrange a Skype and tea if desired. </p>
<p>- Sponsors of 2.5 days of her work (@ $462) will be able to have a long lunch with Anne O Nomis after she's finished her 21 days, and enable her to express her gratitude for their support. If the supporter is overseas, Anne is happy to arrange a Skype if desired. </p>
<p>- Sponsors of 1 week of her work (@ $925) will be able to have a long dinner and chat with Anne O Nomis, or a personalised tour of an art exhibition or museum collection such as the NGV in Melbourne. Anne is happy to alternative solutions to suit people living in other locations overseas to acknowledge their support.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Managing expectations &amp; reality-check</h3>
<p>Naturally it's going to be a challenge to try and write an erotic work within 21 days.</p>
<p>Anne used to write fictional work as a high school student, and won a poetry writing contest, as well as the Auckland University legal history writing prize. She is also a published non-fiction author, and her skills as a wordsmith are evident.</p>
<p>She has a strong concept of what she wants to write, but is not sure herself how it will go with the plot tracking, character development, erotic content, and so on. Only time will tell...</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why she thinks she can do it</h3>
<p>1) Marquis de Sade wrote the novella 'Justine' <i>(Les Malheurs de la vertu)</i> reportedly in two weeks in 1787, while imprisoned in the Bastille. It was 187 pages long. (He later produced an extended version in 1791, and a further extended version in 1901 which with the sister-work 'Juliette' amounted to 4000 pages.

</div></div>","The 21 day challenge
Historian and elusive authoress Anne O Nomis researched the Dominatrix's history over four years, and wrote the first ever work on the subject  - 'The History & Arts of the Dominatrix' (2013). The book has gone on to be positively reviewed by DDI Magazine, Massad Magazine, Library Journal Review, Leatherati USA, and has become the training curriculum for Mistresses around the world.
Anne O Nomis is well-educated, with a Masters degree in Comparative Art and Archaeology from UCL (University College London). She hosts the ""Forbidden Book Club"" at Passionfruit, and gives talks on archaeology and history, particularly pertaining to the field of sexuality.
She has wanted for some time to produce a work of erotic fiction. What's stopped her is that in the last 2 years she had a baby girl, a cancer diagnosis and surgery, and lives in a country of which she is not a national and so is not entitled to any government benefits or support. As a result, she is busy working, paying for childcare and earning money for rent and expenses. When she's not busy working, she's busy looking after her daughter and doing domestic chores, leaving her very little free time. 
She wants 21 days to write a work of erotic literature.
21 days of having a babysitter to look after her toddler daughter. 
21 days of charging up on caffeine in her favourite mocha coffee. 
21 days of a morning jog followed by solid hours of writing.
21 days of shutting out distractions, turning her phone on silent, ignoring her email during the period of solid writing hours to solely focus on it. 
She wants to get this work out to her fans and supporters, and to the world. She hopes to then follow the fictional erotica work with the release of her non-fiction work which has been four years in the process, on the ancient sex Goddesses of Mesopotamia, Levant and Cyprus and literature and art spanning 3000 years.
She has calculated that the cost to cover babysitting and coffee for 21 days to write will be AUD $185 a day x 21 days = $3885
 

What her patrons and supporters will get
- Confidential manuscript draft updates of her erotic literary manuscript for all supporters, and get to read her work as it progresses over 21 days. They'll also be acknowledged in her book acknowledgments if the work gets published, and receive a first edition book.
In addition to this...
- Sponsors of 1 day of her work (@ $185) will be able to have a 50 minute meeting with Anne O Nomis after she's finished her 21 days, for coffee and chat, and enable her to express her gratitude for their support. If the supporter is overseas, Anne is happy to arrange a Skype and tea if desired. 
- Sponsors of 2.5 days of her work (@ $462) will be able to have a long lunch with Anne O Nomis after she's finished her 21 days, and enable her to express her gratitude for their support. If the supporter is overseas, Anne is happy to arrange a Skype if desired. 
- Sponsors of 1 week of her work (@ $925) will be able to have a long dinner and chat with Anne O Nomis, or a personalised tour of an art exhibition or museum collection such as the NGV in Melbourne. Anne is happy to alternative solutions to suit people living in other locations overseas to acknowledge their support.
 

Managing expectations & reality-check
Naturally it's going to be a challenge to try and write an erotic work within 21 days.
Anne used to write fictional work as a high school student, and won a poetry writing contest, as well as the Auckland University legal history writing prize. She is also a published non-fiction author, and her skills as a wordsmith are evident.
She has a strong concept of what she wants to write, but is not sure herself how it will go with the plot tracking, character development, erotic content, and so on. Only time will tell...
 

Why she thinks she can do it
1) Marquis de Sade wrote the novella 'Justine' (Les Malheurs de la vertu) reportedly in two weeks in 1787, while imprisoned in the Bastille. It was 187 pages long. (He later produced an extended version in 1791, and a further extended version in 1901 which with the sister-work 'Juliette' amounted to 4000 pages. However the initial work was what kick-started Marquis de Sade's erotic literature.)
2) Anne O Nomis wrote 'The History & Arts of the Dominatrix' in a dedicated 3 month period in Hanoi, Vietnam where she'd gone with the express intention to write it. This was the culmination of approximately 4 years of research. However the experience of writing daily for extended periods of time with a specific deadline and intention was what drove her to get the book finished. She expects she could do a literary fictional work of erotica in the shorter period of 21 days.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Enigma Front: ONWARD!</h3>
<p>We're living in troubling times, and it's hard not to let the headlines get you down. Political figures bickering like schoolchildren on Twitter. Unprecedented natural disasters. Persistent grim economic forecasts. Avocado toast. We could use some stories that turn a hopeful eye to the future right about now.</p>
<p><strong>Enigma Front: ONWARD</strong> will bring together optimistic speculative fiction stories from members of IFWA, the Imaginative Fiction Writers Association. Our members range from hobbyists and beginners to internationally-renowned best-selling writers from across Canada and around the globe, with several Hugo, Nebula, and Aurora Award winners among our ranks!</p>
<p><strong>ONWARD</strong> will be the fourth volume in the Enigma Front anthology series, and the first published by ExitZero Books. We are planning to release the book in August 2018.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>We're setting a Flexible Funding goal of $1500 to get the anthology into print. At least half of whatever we raise through this campaign will be put toward paying the writers for their stories. Put simply, the more we raise here, the more the writers get paid.</p>
<p>We also need to, y'know... <i>print the book</i>. Print on demand publishing has made this easier and more cost effective than ever for small presses, but there are still upfront costs which must be covered. If we don't meet our $1500 goal, we will still be producing the anthology with whatever we do raise.</p>
<p>As for what you get, <strong>Enigma Front: ONWARD</strong> will be an important collection of optimistic speculative fiction. IFWA is a pretty diverse crowd of writers, so you're looking at a book with science fiction, fantasy, horror, slipstream, all of the _____punk genres, and likely a few stories that defy categorization. The writers are working on their stories right now, and we're hoping to cram around 20 pieces into the finished book when we release in August 2018.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>Since 2015, the Enigma Front anthology series has been a stepping stone for new authors and editors to dip their toes into the murky waters of the publishing business. A number of promising writers have seen their first stories show up in past Enigma Front books alongside seasoned veterans and a few big names.</p>
<p>For a beginning writer, seeing a story you've worked on in print is an incredibly encouraging thing to see for the first time, and having that credit to your name opens doors further down the road. Your support on this campaign ensures the continuance of the Enigma Front anthology series, allowing us to offer this opportunity to more new and upcoming writers for years to come.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks are minimal. We have a good team of editors at the ready, most of whom have worked on projects like this before. We have a talented pool of writers already working on their stories, and ample time to put the book together before our release date of August 2018.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Pollyanna is a new comics and graphic works publisher based out of St. Petersburg, FL. Pollyanna was born out of a desire to create and share the thing that makes life worth living--art! We believe art should be accessible to everyone, but for many the art world appears to be completely closed off; even with the growth of social media as a marketing platform, it’s hard for emerging creators to stand out against a sea of competitors. Here at Pollyanna Publishing, we are dedicated to giving independent artists, writers, comics, and creatives from all walks of life the ability to produce and profit off their work.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Surf Blurb connects individuals who live in different countries. International shipping is always expensive. As this project gets fully funded, the Surf Blurb will look for partnership with international shipping companies to reduce shipping costs.</p>
<p>The Surf Blurb is a high quality website and is a bit slow. I will work on this issue, as full support will help me to get the proper image optimizer software.</p>

Risks & Challenges
The Surf Blurb connects individuals who live in different countries. International shipping is always expensive. As this project gets fully funded, the Surf Blurb will look for partnership with international shipping companies to reduce shipping costs.
The Surf Blurb is a high quality website and is a bit slow. I will work on this issue, as full support will help me to get the proper image optimizer software.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The unexplained is scary, intriguing, and just darn fascinating! Tales of the Unexplained will take the reader on 4 adventures! Allow your mind to expand and bask in the unknown, securing your copy before publication. However, this is not my first publication.</p>
<p> In the Fall of 2017, I published book 1 (Joshua: Life After Theos) in a YA Sci Fi Romance Trilogy. In 2018, book 2 (Joshua: Breaking Free) was published. Next Year (2020) book 3 will be published. But before that happens, this anthology needs to emerge. This anthology will be a collection of mysterious tales of the paranormal and other forms of the unexplained. It will consist of 1 mystery novella (approx 30,000 words), and 3 short stories (each under 10,000 words) in the mystery, paranormal and magic realism genres. Basically, tales of the unexplained! These stories will entertain readers from 10/12 on up through adult.</p>
<p>And you can be a part of this journey!!! Read on!!!!</p>
<p>**The above picture (which will be on the front cover) was drawn for me 14 years ago when I was writing the novella which will be the first story in this anthology. The illustrator is Justin Montan. Inside this anthology there will be additional sketches by local art students (Dover and/or New Philadelphia High Schools) specifically chosen to represent scenes from each of the 3 short stories.</p>

<li>As many of you know, I was a theatre professional for over 25 years, mostly writing plays but also acting and producing.</li>
<li>Seven years ago I retired from theatre in order to pursue other forms of writing and story-telling.</li>
<li>In that time I have:<ul>
<li>Founded a monthly literary series called <strong>Loud Mouth Lit</strong>.</li>
<li>Written a wild, weird quasi-memoir called The Starting Gate (available as an e-book, paperback and audio book <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Gate-Cocktail-Working-Drinking/dp/B01BMRBSNW"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.)</li>
<li>Generated countless poems and essays.</li>
<li>Written a novel inspired by my time working as the only male executive assistant in the senior executive suite of Washington Mutual Bank during the run up to the Great Recession. (I was planning on self-publishing this book in the spring until this current pandemic crisis changed everything.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>So yeah, I’ve been trying to stay busy in my retirement, but I have never lost touch with my fellow theatre practitioners, and I can tell you that right now they are hurting right along with every other person who makes their living by being in close personal contact with other people, especially in large groups.</p><p>I feel like this crisis is hitting local theatre artists especially hard. It is difficult for them to ply their trade on-line when their performances are in direct competition with Hollywood offerings on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and Disney +.</p><p>My short stories would provide some original content for them to work their performance muscles on, and this crowd funding campaign would allow me to pay them a viable wage to do it.</p><p>The impact of this project, if fully successful, could result in the opening of a whole new channel for local actors to help develop local authors’ material, regardless if that writing was ultimately intended for the stage. </p><p>In other words, this could be the start of something big.</p><p>But for now, even just a small contribution from you can go a long way.</p><p><strong>How It Will Work</strong></p><p>I have set a goal of raising $7,000 dollars. For every thousand dollars I raise, I will record one of my short stories employing a Seattle-area stage actor to do it, and paying them at least $500 for the job. The remaining funds will go to paying for the audio recording studio time, the director and sound technicians, and miscellaneous promotion and administrative fees. (For instance, Indiegogo charges a 5% fee for the use of this platform.)</p><p><strong>What You Get in Return</strong></p><p><strong>Give $10</strong> and you will receive a professionally recorded audio short story, performed by a Pacific Northwest actor.</p><p><strong>Give $25</strong> and you will receive the collection of all seven of the stories we record.</p><p><strong>Give $50</strong> and get all seven stories, <strong><i>plus</i></strong> a free copy of the paperback edition of my book <strong><i>The Starting Gate</i></strong> (a 15$ value.)</p><p><strong>Give $100</strong> and you will receive all seven stories, <strong><i>plus</i></strong> a free copy of the <strong>limited first edition</strong> hardback version of my book <strong><i>The Starting Gate</i></strong> (a 25$ value and there are only 20 of them left), <strong><i>plus</i></strong> I will record a sonnet of your choosing by William Shakespeare, written back during a similar epidemic which closed all of the theaters in England.</p><p><strong>Give $500</strong> and you’ll get all the perks offered for $100 and <i>also</i> receive the option of nominating the professional Pacific Northwest actor whom you wish to record one of my stories.</p><p><strong>Give $1,000</strong> and you’ll get all the perks offered for $100 and <i>also</i> receive the option of commissioning a brand new, original story written by me based on initiating parameters that you provide. And I’ll let you cast the actor, too, if you want.</p><p>We will fund this project as we go. The risk of not raising the entire amount is limited because I will only record as many stories as I can afford to pay actors to read.</p><p><strong>My Track Record</strong></p><p>I have done this sort of thing. Not only did I produce several original productions while I was still working in the theatre, I also crowd funded the publishing of my book <i><strong><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Gate-Cocktail-Working-Drinking/dp/B01BMRBSNW"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Starting Gate</a> </strong></i>using this platform, Indiegogo.  I raised $7,125 from 163 backers, which allowed me to publish the book in hardcopy, paperback, electronic version for Kindle as well as an audio book, recorded at Cedar House Audio. We can do this because we have already.</p><p>Make no mistake, this isn’t so much a charity as it is a brand-new possibility born out of crisis. With your support and a lot of hard work on the part of actors, and other recording professionals, we might be able to crack open an entirely new market, matching local writers to local actors, giving people work now while we are waiting for the theaters to reopen, but also offering new work in the future if we should discover that there is a market for these kinds of stories.</p><p><strong>So Many Ways to Help Make this Happen</strong></p><p>For as little as $10 you can help make a new audio recording of an original story happen, but I understand money is extremely tight right now, and the future is uncertain. If you cannot spare the cash but are still interested in the outcome of <strong>Crowd Mouth Lit</strong>, then please let me know. It could well be that your voice spreading the word about this project will go further to bringing it to fruition than any monetary donation.</p><p>So give money if you can, but spread the word in any case. I earnestly believe that it will be lots of modest projects like this that will make the difference in people’s lives as we move forward out of these difficult times.</p><p>And we <strong><i>will </i></strong>move forward.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Paul</p></div>","The Gist I plan to pay local, professional stage actors, currently and indefinitely out of work, to record the sizable collection of short stories, which I’ve written since retiring from playwriting and theatre a few years ago.

 So yeah, I’ve been trying to stay busy in my retirement, but I have never lost touch with my fellow theatre practitioners, and I can tell you that right now they are hurting right along with every other person who makes their living by being in close personal contact with other people, especially in large groups.I feel like this crisis is hitting local theatre artists especially hard. It is difficult for them to ply their trade on-line when their performances are in direct competition with Hollywood offerings on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and Disney +.My short stories would provide some original content for them to work their performance muscles on, and this crowd funding campaign would allow me to pay them a viable wage to do it.The impact of this project, if fully successful, could result in the opening of a whole new channel for local actors to help develop local authors’ material, regardless if that writing was ultimately intended for the stage. In other words, this could be the start of something big.But for now, even just a small contribution from you can go a long way.How It Will WorkI have set a goal of raising $7,000 dollars. For every thousand dollars I raise, I will record one of my short stories employing a Seattle-area stage actor to do it, and paying them at least $500 for the job. The remaining funds will go to paying for the audio recording studio time, the director and sound technicians, and miscellaneous promotion and administrative fees. (For instance, Indiegogo charges a 5% fee for the use of this platform.)What You Get in ReturnGive $10 and you will receive a professionally recorded audio short story, performed by a Pacific Northwest actor.Give $25 and you will receive the collection of all seven of the stories we record.Give $50 and get all seven stories, plus a free copy of the paperback edition of my book The Starting Gate (a 15$ value.)Give $100 and you will receive all seven stories, plus a free copy of the limited first edition hardback version of my book The Starting Gate (a 25$ value and there are only 20 of them left), plus I will record a sonnet of your choosing by William Shakespeare, written back during a similar epidemic which closed all of the theaters in England.Give $500 and you’ll get all the perks offered for $100 and also receive the option of nominating the professional Pacific Northwest actor whom you wish to record one of my stories.Give $1,000 and you’ll get all the perks offered for $100 and also receive the option of commissioning a brand new, original story written by me based on initiating parameters that you provide. And I’ll let you cast the actor, too, if you want.We will fund this project as we go. The risk of not raising the entire amount is limited because I will only record as many stories as I can afford to pay actors to read.My Track RecordI have done this sort of thing. Not only did I produce several original productions while I was still working in the theatre, I also crowd funded the publishing of my book The Starting Gate using this platform, Indiegogo.  I raised $7,125 from 163 backers, which allowed me to publish the book in hardcopy, paperback, electronic version for Kindle as well as an audio book, recorded at Cedar House Audio. We can do this because we have already.Make no mistake, this isn’t so much a charity as it is a brand-new possibility born out of crisis. With your support and a lot of hard work on the part of actors, and other recording professionals, we might be able to crack open an entirely new market, matching local writers to local actors, giving people work now while we are waiting for the theaters to reopen, but also offering new work in the future if we should discover that there is a market for these kinds of stories.So Many Ways to Help Make this HappenFor as little as $10 you can help make a new audio recording of an original story happen, but I understand money is extremely tight right now, and the future is uncertain. If you cannot spare the cash but are still interested in the outcome of Crowd Mouth Lit, then please let me know. It could well be that your voice spreading the word about this project will go further to bringing it to fruition than any monetary donation.So give money if you can, but spread the word in any case. I earnestly believe that it will be lots of modest projects like this that will make the difference in people’s lives as we move forward out of these difficult times.And we will move forward.Love,Paul",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>Greetings friends and fellow artists. My name is James Lawson Moore, and I hope to have just a moment of your time. It concerns a project I care about very much. By the end of my little spiel I hope that you will care about it too.</p>
<p>            See, I am a writer, and while I write all kinds of things—from essays to film scripts to the occasional novel—it is in poetry that I take my primary form. Between studying various forms of literature in college, hitting up the open mic circuit, and engaging with my fellow artists in roundtable conversations (where much coffee and soda is consumed), I have amassed a sizable collection of words over the years. It is with a sampling of those words that I seek to publish a series of poetry collections, to be billed under the title of Renegade Poetry. The series will comprise of at least three or four books, and they will be issued in ebook and paperback formats.</p>
<p>            I’ve done a fair bit in indie publishing, releasing a few small collections and even a crime novel through Amazon’s KDP. And I’ve enjoyed going the indie poetry route. But for all the love I have for KDP I want to be able to do more with my art. Which is why I plan on moving over to IngramSpark with this next series of books. With IngramSpark I’ll be able to get my work into actual brick and mortar stores. And getting into brick and mortar stores is what every writer dreams of.</p>
<p>            In order to do this I’ll need some help. There are some upfront costs to publishing through IngramSpark, the largest cost being the purchase of ISBN numbers so that I can establish my own publishing imprint. Services like CreateSpace and KDP offer ISBNs for free, but you don’t get to name the imprint with them and it makes for a harder time getting distributed anywhere other than on Amazon.</p>
<p>            Which brings me to what I am now asking of you, which is some help with the cost of ISBN numbers, as well as to offset some of the print costs for the first batch of paperbacks I’ll be ordering of the first book in the series, <i>Word Pictures Etched in My Head</i>. This book comprises some of my best writing, and will soon be followed by a book that is even better.</p>
<p>            For those of you who are wondering what I’m getting at here, it’s this. I am asking for 750 dollars to go towards the bulk purchase of 10 ISN numbers, as well as the initial setup fee through Ingram and printing a run of the first book. I also hope to have some funds to help with various promotional and advertising needs.</p>
<p>            Those of you who would like to contribute to my goal will receive great perks, such as ebook downloads of the book, signed and numbered limited broadsides of single poems, signed copies of paperbacks and even personalized videos where I do an “open mic” style reading of a poem written specifically for the person who chooses that option (and it’s an awesome option if I do say so myself). Every little bit helps, and you’d be giving to a guy who gives his all to create the best possible art.</p>
<p>            That pretty much sums up what I was hoping to say. I want to thank each of you who’ve taken the time to check out my crowdfunding campaign. If you would like to contribute the perks are on the right side of the page. And if you think your Facebook and Twitter friends would be interested please share the page so that they can find out about it. Word of mouth exposure from friends is among the best forms of publicity for an artist, no matter the medium in which they work.</p>

            See, I am a writer, and while I write all kinds of things—from essays to film scripts to the occasional novel—it is in poetry that I take my primary form. Between studying various forms of literature in college, hitting up the open mic circuit, and engaging with my fellow artists in roundtable conversations (where much coffee and soda is consumed), I have amassed a sizable collection of words over the years. It is with a sampling of those words that I seek to publish a series of poetry collections, to be billed under the title of Renegade Poetry. The series will comprise of at least three or four books, and they will be issued in ebook and paperback formats.
            I’ve done a fair bit in indie publishing, releasing a few small collections and even a crime novel through Amazon’s KDP. And I’ve enjoyed going the indie poetry route. But for all the love I have for KDP I want to be able to do more with my art. Which is why I plan on moving over to IngramSpark with this next series of books. With IngramSpark I’ll be able to get my work into actual brick and mortar stores. And getting into brick and mortar stores is what every writer dreams of.
            In order to do this I’ll need some help. There are some upfront costs to publishing through IngramSpark, the largest cost being the purchase of ISBN numbers so that I can establish my own publishing imprint. Services like CreateSpace and KDP offer ISBNs for free, but you don’t get to name the imprint with them and it makes for a harder time getting distributed anywhere other than on Amazon.
            Which brings me to what I am now asking of you, which is some help with the cost of ISBN numbers, as well as to offset some of the print costs for the first batch of paperbacks I’ll be ordering of the first book in the series, Word Pictures Etched in My Head. This book comprises some of my best writing, and will soon be followed by a book that is even better.
            For those of you who are wondering what I’m getting at here, it’s this. I am asking for 750 dollars to go towards the bulk purchase of 10 ISN numbers, as well as the initial setup fee through Ingram and printing a run of the first book. I also hope to have some funds to help with various promotional and advertising needs.
            Those of you who would like to contribute to my goal will receive great perks, such as ebook downloads of the book, signed and numbered limited broadsides of single poems, signed copies of paperbacks and even personalized videos where I do an “open mic” style reading of a poem written specifically for the person who chooses that option (and it’s an awesome option if I do say so myself). Every little bit helps, and you’d be giving to a guy who gives his all to create the best possible art.
            That pretty much sums up what I was hoping to say. I want to thank each of you who’ve taken the time to check out my crowdfunding campaign. If you would like to contribute the perks are on the right side of the page. And if you think your Facebook and Twitter friends would be interested please share the page so that they can find out about it.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I've struggled with my mental health for years, but over the course of lockdown, it went seriously downhill. In the past 12 months, I've been forced to quit two jobs because of it. After quitting the second one, I knew I had to change, but I didn't know exactly how. I started on antidepressants in December and it's been a rough ride since.</p>
<p><br/><strong>I've always wanted to help people, but I didn't know how.</strong> I always thought my anxiety would get in the way. But then, one day last week, a thought crossed my mind. I don't really know where it came from - I wasn't even reading a book at the time. I thought - I should open a bookstore. So I looked into it. I was up all night, and by the next morning, I knew this was what I had to do.</p>
<p><br/>I don't have many passions, and my depression, along with the pandemic, stopped me from doing any of the few I did have. Last month I bought a bunch of books and since then it's been my main pastime. <strong>Books transfer you to a different world</strong> - all the struggles disappear from your mind. You're in a new world. Or a different part of the world. Books allow you to escape from reality in a way that film &amp; tv can't do. Video games come close - but your brain is still only comprehending the images that somebody else has made. With a book, you have to think about the words and create your own picture in your mind - no two people interpret what they read in the same way and THAT is what makes books so special. The words are the same, but the images you see are unique to you.</p>

</div><div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>There are a number of things we need to pay for before we get access to our main funding. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accountants &amp; Solicitors fees</li>
<li>Chartered Surveyor fees</li>
<li>Industry-specific subscriptions</li>
<li>Research for my business plan</li>
<li>Buying 'test' stock from suppliers to evaluate quality</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't worry, you can receive awesome rewards for your support! These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>5% Founders discount</li>
<li>10% VIP discount</li>
<li>Trial subscriptions</li>
<li>Premium MVP discount!</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are any other rewards you would like, please let me know and I'll see what I can do!</p>
<h2>How Your Support Helps Others</h2>
<p><strong>Outside of selling books, the main aim of our store is to create a community hub and help as many people as possible. </strong>This is what I am most passionate about! I want the store to be a centrepiece of the community. I want every single person who enters to feel safe &amp; loved &amp; appreciated. Even if you’re not buying a book, I want you to come by and say hello and browse and talk to other like-minded members of the community. Every independent bookstore I have researched is invested in its local community. That is why I think a bookshop works so well as a hub to help as many people as possible. The two go hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the organisations I plan to help or partner with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schools &amp; Nurseries (including special schools)</li>
<li>Hospitals, GP Surgeries &amp; Dentists (so you have something to do while you wait)</li>
<li>A host of different local charities (please let me know which charities may benefit from our help)</li>
<li>Other local businesses (Again, let me know of any who may benefit from partnering with us)</li>
<li>Stafford Borough Council &amp; Staffordshire County Council</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are any other organisations with who you think we could work well and who share our values, please tell me!</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Don't worry if you can't contribute any money to this campaign. Here are some other ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Spread the word!</strong> The most valuable way you can help is by telling your friends and family about the project. The more people who know about it, the better.</li>
<li>
<strong>Donate your used books! </strong>Used books will be much cheaper for those who cannot afford new books, so every donation helps the people who need it most. If you donate a large amount of books, we may even pay you for them! <i>Note: Used books must be in sellable condition to receive compensation, e.g. no missing or ripped pages. We also want a variety, so please don't donate your whole Stephen King collection of 50 books!</i>

<h3>Telling Gulfport's stories, one Thursday at a time.</h3>
<p>The Gabber is a free weekly paper, distributed every Thursday, but it’s more than that — it’s the voice of Gulfport and the surrounding communities in South Pinellas County. The Gabber shows up when no other news can or will. Without the Gabber, no one’s writing about what’s happening in downtown Gulfport, or at the Gulfport History Museum, or at the Community Garden. No one’s writing about what makes Jimmy Oswain so special (you may know him as “Mr. Gulfport” on the green bicycle), or <a href=""https://thegabber.com/gulfport-helping-businesses-helping-people/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">how Gulfportians help one another throughout the pandemic</a>, where <a href=""https://thegabber.com/follow-the-money-gulfport-elections-2020/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">city council candidates get their money</a>, or what’s happening with <a href=""https://thegabber.com/new-hub-for-the-arts-set-to-open/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gulfport’s arts hub</a>. Since 1968, the Gabber has been the voice of our community and the people who love it.</p>
<p>Gabber reporters sit through city council meetings, show up at every event in the city, and highlight all the good things — <a href=""https://thegabber.com/operation-santa-brightens-holiday/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">little</a>, <a href=""https://thegabber.com/heroes-on-beach-save-boys-life/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">large</a>, and <a href=""https://thegabber.com/gulfport-firefighters-save-cat-from-fire/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">heartwarming</a> — happening in our community.

<p>The Gabber is a vital resource for clubs and organizations throughout the community. The paper’s a digital and print bulletin board — and sounding board — for not only the community, but local government, charitable organizations, and small businesses. </p>
<p>For more than half-century, the Gabber Newspaper has served Gulfport and South Pinellas County. It is one of the last family-owned papers in Florida, and it needs your help to come back stronger than ever. The Gabber ceased publishing in print and online in March, and Gulfport and the South Pinellas communities it serves weekly are anxious for it to return. </p>

WHY Support Souled?

Souled is an important book in this technological world. As all of us are inundated by screens and devices, tech appears to consume us all more and more. 
See my talk with Dave D'Aoust on You Tube!  


In addition to being a teacher and an author, I'm also a mom of a 15-year-old boy. Even with everything I know about tech, I wasn't able to stop the pull video games have on him. 
As an author, I'm often inspired by those around me. As a teacher, I see many of my students feel the same pull to a video game. 
Since I love to teach through stories, a middle-grade story formed about a boy who gets trapped inside a video game. There's one scene that battles the constant distraction our screens have on us. In this scene, Ethan has to force himself to pull away from the distraction in order to complete the mission and be successful. 

 
What is SOULED?
Souled is an upper middle-grade fantasy novel about friendship, family and loyalty. Oh - and gaming!
When Ethan and his friends play the much anticipated new game Seeker, they are thrown into a new world where the lines of reality and gaming are blurred. As people close to Ethan, including his sister, start to disappear, Ethan and his team must free the trapped souls, defeat the dark wizard and stop the destruction before he and his friends are trapped forever.
THE PULL OF THE GAME...

Ever play a video game and wonder where the past 6 hours went...
Ever feel like it was time to pull away, but you had to play just one more level... 
Ever think, ""Just one more try...""

Ethan and his friends discover what's behind that pull in Seeker.


 
What would you do if you were playing your favorite video game and became trapped there? That's the question that started it all with SOULED.
 
As a parent and a teacher, I see the pull that technology has on our children. In fact, my own son plays more than he should. That got me thinking that it's almost like someone is inside these games entrapping them and making it hard to leave them. From there the story of SOULED was born.

Our writer, Jason, has written a crime novel set in California that forms the first part in a series of books. A San Francisco banker cut to pieces in Yosemite; a diamond edged slaughter knife; a tech billionaire as suspect and the Stanford University Crime Writing Club with secrets worth dying for. Detective Abrahams hoped for a new life in the mountains to escape a death wish. Now he wants answers before his wish comes true.In his way is the person closest to him: Raven. She’s his partner in the case, an ex-army officer and veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  He dreams about the Torah and oblivion; she has nightmares of corpses piled high in village streets. She wants a second chance; he wants her off the case. Because she’s a liability.Because she’s his sister.As the investigation moves into the underworld of San Francisco and Silicon Valley  they uncover what they really need: clues to the unsolved murder of their own mother. But as the city descends into a bloodbath they realise the price of justice comes at a deadly cost.It is a revenge story but ultimately its central theme is loss. Just how far would you go to heal the pain of losing someone you loved?The beauty of the digital medium is not only can you follow the story in a linear fashion but you get the option to explore other dynamic  and immersive elements that a stand alone published or ebook book simply can't provide. By entering the website you can explore the locations, crime scenes, murder weapons, characters backgrounds as well as alternate story lines, short stories, maps, biographies, and loads of stunning art work and design. We really focussed on customising the reader experience such as size of text and font, background colours, choice of avatar etc.  We are totally committed to accessibility and again this medium allows us to provide  those with reading difficulties the ability to adapt the text to meet their needs. Add to that our goal of audio options for as many aspects of the story as possible and we hope to provide as an inclusive story world as possible to our readers and listeners.Not only all this but we are building into the project a networking capability too! You can chat with other readers of the story, post your comments directly next to the text, link in to the rest of the internet and social media, and contact the writers directly. Add in writer interviews and videos with experts such as forensic specialists, historians, etc then we have something truly original and game changing for the world of crime fiction. You can see here some of the features we have developed so far and we have so much more waiting in the wings. Indeed,  we want to listen to what readers want and to keep innovating.Dashboard - Once you enter the story you will have your own personalised dashboard to give you complete control over your experience while in the crime universe. Work your way through an interactive crime board with access to great features.You can also use the website to find links to further research material and a whole host of additional material such as short stories, diary entries, alternate storylines.Interactive map - Use an interactive map to find locations in the story and more content on the places, characters, events in the story.Comment with your friends on the story - As well as interactive and immersive digital content we want you to enjoy experiencing the crime universe with your friends and fellow readers with features such as sharing comments on the story.SCReeeM - The main suspects in the murder are members of the Stanford University Crime Writing Club. Their magazine SCReeeM (Stanford Crime wRitErs Magazine) provides clues to the case and the various editions are online and the individual stories are ready for you to read in addition to the main story.

Artwork - more clues and important parts of the storyline are conveyed in these illustrations also.
 The initial release of  our digital crime universe is scheduled for Autumn/Winter 2021. FWe will release chapters and additional content on a monthly basis and keep developing and improving the crime universe we have created. We want to continue working with our talented team of designers and software developers. The funds we are looking to raise will go directly towards salaries for these staff and into software development to enable us to keep innovating.In return for your support, we can offer a host of perks from signed exclusive artwork, to discounted subscription rates to the digital crime universe to even having a character named after you in the story!

Cara enjoys creating digital illustration and concept art and has previously worked at XR games. Working on the digital story universe has been a great opportunity for Cara to push her creativity and think outside the box! Riya - Graphic DesignerI’m Riya, a second year student at University of Reading, specialising in graphic communication and Typography, with a passion for art direction and illustration.Sam - Application DeveloperI am Sam Kinloch Large a 3rd year Mechanical Engineering who also specialises in software design and user experiences. I have a business in web and app design. When creating the DigitalCrimeUniverse, I focussed on making a game like user experience where people can be immersed in the story.Overall we believe that storytelling can be greatly enhanced through using the technology we all use in our day to day lives. Through combining great literature with digital content such as video, animation, gamification and interactive features our mission is to bring a new medium to the way we enjoy storytelling. We believe crime fiction is the perfect genre for this as it allows us to present the reader with a vast range of engaging clues or events that lead up to a crime, readers can then inspect these clues from multiple perspectives.The ideas we are offering in Digital Crime Universe have not been put to market previously. Although we have carried out significant market research before launching, there is a risk that we will need to spend more time than anticipated evolving the features we initially launch  particularly in response to feedback from our customers. From the outset we have built our business on listening to crime readers and our team is committed to delivering a unique and enriching crime fiction reading experience.",17.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>Step right up and meet the Werewolf Of Bedburg, the furry-faced star of a great new novel that has 150 pages of monstrous chills, laughs, suspense ... and the occasional “awwww” moment to put that proverbial lump in your throat.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Hello, readers! My name is Olena Yacoboski.</strong></h3>
<p>I am a Ukrainian writer and poet. I hope you adore New Year’s and Christmas as much as I do. These magical winter holidays inspired me to write this book. Those transformations taking place as each season changes are real miracles. The Fairies of the Four Seasons work very hard to make you see the wonders of nature all around us.</p>
<p>This book,<strong> ""Fairies of the Four Seasons""</strong> is the first of four Children's books I will publish.<strong> I write my books in Ukrainian and then have them translated to English. Both languages are in this book.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My goal is to inspire children with love and a deep appreciation of nature.</strong> In this book, there are four long poems about each season. All my poems have the central theme of how the beauty of the Earth encompasses all things.  </p>
<p>I worked closely with my <strong>illustrator Svetlana Navrotska </strong>for two years to prepare all the original, hand-painted illustrations for this gift edition book. The illustrations are essential to my poems. They elaborate through color and detail, and carefully integrate images with my poetry to amplify emotions. </p>
<p><strong>The superb translations to English are by Steve Komarnyckyj.</strong> His literary translations and poems have appeared in Index on Censorship, Modern Poetry in Translation and many other journals. He is the holder of two PEN awards and is also a highly regarded English language poet. </p>
<p>I seek to educate, entertain, and capture the imagination of my young readers– to encourage a lifetime of reading enrichment and enjoyment. <strong>My dream is to be a writer and publisher of exquisite literature for children.</strong> I hope I can attain that more quickly with your generous help.</p>
<p><strong>The book measures 30 cm (11.8 inches) by 30 cm (11.8 inches) and is 80 pages long. Now it is ready to be printed and published. I have displayed some of its pages below including the first verses of each poem.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Stretch Goal- </strong></h3>
<p>If I raise at least <strong>$20,000,</strong> I will, as quickly as possible, complete my next children's book called<strong> ""The Golden Bird""</strong> which is a fairy-tale telling the myth of a bird with golden wings. It is about deep family love in nature.</p>
<p>This beautiful tale is set in the times of an ancient continent and concerns a Golden Bird who is held, along with other gold birds, captive in a mythical kingdom ruled by an evil Queen. One day the bird strays beyond the Sequoia marking the edge of where they may fly into the magic forest. The creatures there are eventually moved to rescue the Golden Bird and the other captives, because one of their number, a peacock was also held prisoner by the evil Queen and cast out when he had lost too many feathers to be beautiful in her eyes. They rescue the birds at a point when the enchantment over the evil magic kingdom is weak because the moon is eclipsed by the earth.</p>
<p>The book will be printed entirely in English. The text has already been completed and the incredible illustrations for the book are now being worked on. Any backers of the <strong>""Fairies of the Four Seasons""</strong> campaign will be be added to my mailing list and I will inform them directly when my new book is finished. They will also receive a substantial discount on<strong> ""The Golden Bird""</strong> and have the opportunity to obtain signed and dedicated copies. </p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>There is so much suffering in our world these days. We have COVID 19 , seemingly endless wars, societal conflicts, and perilous times for nature and our environment. I hope my book can, in some small way, help children understand what the love of nature is in relationship to the nature of love. I do recognize these vital truths. When you love, everything will come right. Love has its own action. Love, and you will know the blessings of it. Love, and there will be understanding.  </p>
<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>The book is now ready to print so the creative risks do not exist.</p>
<p>I have already found the right printer in Ukraine. I've looked at samples they have printed and I'm confident that they will do very good work.</p>

Hello, readers! My name is Olena Yacoboski.
I am a Ukrainian writer and poet. I hope you adore New Year’s and Christmas as much as I do. These magical winter holidays inspired me to write this book. Those transformations taking place as each season changes are real miracles. The Fairies of the Four Seasons work very hard to make you see the wonders of nature all around us.
This book, ""Fairies of the Four Seasons"" is the first of four Children's books I will publish. I write my books in Ukrainian and then have them translated to English. Both languages are in this book.
My goal is to inspire children with love and a deep appreciation of nature. In this book, there are four long poems about each season. All my poems have the central theme of how the beauty of the Earth encompasses all things.  
I worked closely with my illustrator Svetlana Navrotska for two years to prepare all the original, hand-painted illustrations for this gift edition book. The illustrations are essential to my poems. They elaborate through color and detail, and carefully integrate images with my poetry to amplify emotions. 
The superb translations to English are by Steve Komarnyckyj. His literary translations and poems have appeared in Index on Censorship, Modern Poetry in Translation and many other journals. He is the holder of two PEN awards and is also a highly regarded English language poet. 
I seek to educate, entertain, and capture the imagination of my young readers– to encourage a lifetime of reading enrichment and enjoyment. My dream is to be a writer and publisher of exquisite literature for children. I hope I can attain that more quickly with your generous help.
The book measures 30 cm (11.8 inches) by 30 cm (11.8 inches) and is 80 pages long. Now it is ready to be printed and published. I have displayed some of its pages below including the first verses of each poem.

Crystalline Fairies in the Kingdom of Winter
Fairies of Rosy Splendour

  Fairies of Summer Sunbeams

 Fairies of the Golden Time

What We Need & What You Get
This hardcover, gift edition book will be of the highest quality possible. It will be a wonderful gift for avid fairy lovers or a keepsake for your children to cherish as they grow older. I’m asking for your support to help fund the printing, publication, and distribution of the book. By doing so, you will be helping me to realize my dream of inspiring children with literature about the love of nature.
I’m targeting raising $10,000 for this project. 
The costs are distributed across four main categories:
Printing and shipping costs for 500 books: $4,500
Marketing budget for the book post-publishing: $2,500
Money for creating my online book store: $2,500
Indiegogo's platform fee: 5%
We have included 5 perks of the hardcover books and 13 perks of posters of some of the book's illustrations. 
Children will love ""Fairies of the Four Seasons"" when you read to them at night while they gaze at the beautiful  posters adorning their bedroom walls.
There is a Special Perk for six contributors of $500 to our campaign.

PERK NINETEEN- ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FOREVER 
FOR SIX CONTRIBUTORS OF $500.  
Be a big part of my journey. Your name will appear in my Acknowledgements with a big Thank You! for the as long as the book is in print. 
Our Splendid Moose represents this perk.

 
Even if the fundraising goal is not met with this project, I will still put the funds towards  printing at least 300 copies- all eligible backers will receive a copy and have their book perks fulfilled. All the poster perks will be 100% fulfilled. We will start shipping the posters during our campaign.
Stretch Goal- 
If I raise at least $20,000, I will, as quickly as possible, complete my next children's book called ""The Golden Bird"" which is a fairy-tale telling the myth of a bird with golden wings. It is about deep family love in nature.
This beautiful tale is set in the times of an ancient continent and concerns a Golden Bird who is held, along with other gold birds, captive in a mythical kingdom ruled by an evil Queen. One day the bird strays beyond the Sequoia marking the edge of where they may fly into the magic forest. The creatures there are eventually moved to rescue the Golden Bird and the other captives, because one of their number, a peacock was also held prisoner by the evil Queen and cast out when he had lost too many feathers to be beautiful in her eyes. They rescue the birds at a point when the enchantment over the evil magic kingdom is weak because the moon is eclipsed by the earth.
The book will be printed entirely in English. The text has already been completed and the incredible illustrations for the book are now being worked on. Any backers of the ""Fairies of the Four Seasons"" campaign will be be added to my mailing list and I will inform them directly when my new book is finished. They will also receive a substantial discount on ""The Golden Bird"" and have the opportunity to obtain signed and dedicated copies. 
The Impact

There is so much suffering in our world these days. We have COVID 19 , seemingly endless wars, societal conflicts, and perilous times for nature and our environment. I hope my book can, in some small way, help children understand what the love of nature is in relationship to the nature of love. I do recognize these vital truths. When you love, everything will come right. Love has its own action. Love, and you will know the blessings of it. Love, and there will be understanding.  
Risks & Challenges

The book is now ready to print so the creative risks do not exist.
I have already found the right printer in Ukraine. I've looked at samples they have printed and I'm confident that they will do very good work.

Shipping Logistics and Timing
Depending on how much money is raised, it may impact the shipping logistics of the book and I will have to manage that wisely as I am planning on shipping all over the world.  
Due to the pandemic, the global supply chain may be experiencing delays across production industries. As I have selected a printer in Ukraine this could cause delays.  However I do not anticipate that these delays would be substantial.

Other Ways You Can Help
Thank you for reading this, and thank you for contributing whatever you are able to. 
If you aren’t able to contribute any money to this project,  don't feel bad about it. I hope you will share my campaign with others and spread the word about it. If you can, please share my book with 5 friends, family members or co-workers whom you think would enjoy it. Please do this as a text message or direct message on social media. The more people the campaign reaches, the more people who will be able to experience the fruits of my endeavors.
