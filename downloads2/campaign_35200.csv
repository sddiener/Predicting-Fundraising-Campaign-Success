<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>We're members of the Center for Investment and Wealth Management at UC Irvine's Paul Merage School of Business and are creators of the Financial Literacy Summer Residential Program to provide deserving teens with an academic foundation in money and investment management.</p>
<p>More than 100 underserved youth in Orange, Los Angeles, and Riverside counties apply for the program each year. Students learn about basic budgeting, banking, credit, financial market comprehension along with career paths, educational options, networking and self-confidence enhancement - essential life skills not typically taught in school to most youth. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our goal this year is to start setting up an endowment for the Financial Literacy Summer Residential Program at UC Irvine, and double the size of the program from 30 8th and 9th graders to over 60 next year. We need $25,000 to help us get started and support next year's program. </p>
<h3>Why do we need this money? </h3>
<div>We've built a fantastic program that students love, but we need your help to bring this program to more students. Our program is made possible by generous private donors and corporate
sponsors. The program receives no UC or Merage School financial support. Your support will help give students an opportunity to experience a program that provides real-world context for learning and helps students connect their education with their future goals. For all of you supporting us through this campaign, we've got some exciting perks lined up for you on the right! <br/><br/>

Who we are
We're members of the Center for Investment and Wealth Management at UC Irvine's Paul Merage School of Business and are creators of the Financial Literacy Summer Residential Program to provide deserving teens with an academic foundation in money and investment management.
More than 100 underserved youth in Orange, Los Angeles, and Riverside counties apply for the program each year. Students learn about basic budgeting, banking, credit, financial market comprehension along with career paths, educational options, networking and self-confidence enhancement - essential life skills not typically taught in school to most youth. 
   
What We Need
Our goal this year is to start setting up an endowment for the Financial Literacy Summer Residential Program at UC Irvine, and double the size of the program from 30 8th and 9th graders to over 60 next year. We need $25,000 to help us get started and support next year's program. 
Why do we need this money? 
We've built a fantastic program that students love, but we need your help to bring this program to more students. Our program is made possible by generous private donors and corporate
sponsors. The program receives no UC or Merage School financial support. Your support will help give students an opportunity to experience a program that provides real-world context for learning and helps students connect their education with their future goals. For all of you supporting us through this campaign, we've got some exciting perks lined up for you on the right!

<h3>What I Need </h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>Last year – out
of curiosity – I tried to sew something, I started with ascots and bow tie, and
then tried with waistcoats: I found a passion which led me to completely change
the path I was following. I left the faculty of Physics and began to spend time
with some professional tailors, who soon became dear friends of mine. Now, as I
say in the vid, I am able to realise skirts, trousers, waistcoats for him and for
her, dresses and a few accessories.<b> Now I want 
to become a professional tailor: in order to realise my dream, I need a
degree in Fashion Design. </b></p>
<p>Although the
Italian handicraft is well-know worldwide, here it is not considered to
important, and it doesn’t get valued; in fact the State and the Politics do not
promote artisans, causing people to ignore it and let it die. Therefore there
are not many universities that launch faculties/courses consistent with any
type of handicraft. Luckily I live near Milan, which offers a great variety of
courses and among these there is Fashion Design. <b>But again, the State does not
help students with this kind of passion: this course is provided by a private
academy, whose tuition is very high, at least for me. </b><br/>
The academy I would like to attend is the NABA (an abbreviation which stays for
“new academy of fine arts”) that offers scholarships for particularly worthy
students. I took part to the competition announcement and won one of the
scholarships: unfortunately it is not high enough to really help me and my
family pay the tuition, since it covers only one tenth of it. <br/>
Here is what and how much I have to pay: </p>

<p>Chuatroj has made impressive strides to
reduce poverty and improve literacy and health in the past 10 years.  We began working directly with Chuatroj’s
leaders and schools 7 years ago after we were drawn by their desire to take
their community’s poverty into their own hands and not wait on others to do it
for them.</p>
<p>El Pueblo Iluminado is a fruit of that labor and is based on the premise of <b>""a hand-up, not a hand-out."" </b>Together we<b> </b>dream of a village that it 100% illuminated, where no one is left behind and no one goes it alone. In September 2014, Chuatroj’s
elementary, middle, and high schools administrations came together to form the
“Pro-Maya Education Inter-institutional Education Committee” with the belief
that secondary education is key to sustainably transform the
quality of life of the most excluded Mayan-K’iche families in Guatemala’s
Western Highlands.  </p>
<p>The <b>27 students selected for the scholarship program represent 134 family members who live on an average of $0.34 per day</b>.  With secondary school being privatized, in January they won't be able afford to continue school.  We can't let that happen.  Each family member sacrifices when school
tuition is paid although food is scarce or when someone is sick.  They have made this sacrifice because they believe that education is the solution.  And it's true.  If these students don't graduate, they will repeat the same cycle as adults... and so will their children... and their grandchildren... </p>
<p><b>How can one student in secondary school be the change agent that pulls their family out of poverty? Isn't that kind of solution expensive? </b></p>

And it's not just about keeping them in school.  We have a plan to do more.




El Pueblo Iluminado (Brightening the Barrio) works with
the 26 most impoverished families the Maya-K’iche village of Chuatroj located
in the mountains of Western Guatemala. Together with Chuatroj’s education
administrators, we are turning the school into a hub for actions that empower
students and families to transform their livelihoods.
** Thank you to the Honorary Consul of Guatemala in West Palm Beach, Florida for continually supporting El Pueblo Iluminado! ** 
Chuatroj has made impressive strides to
reduce poverty and improve literacy and health in the past 10 years.  We began working directly with Chuatroj’s
leaders and schools 7 years ago after we were drawn by their desire to take
their community’s poverty into their own hands and not wait on others to do it
for them.
El Pueblo Iluminado is a fruit of that labor and is based on the premise of ""a hand-up, not a hand-out."" Together we dream of a village that it 100% illuminated, where no one is left behind and no one goes it alone. In September 2014, Chuatroj’s

“Pro-Maya Education Inter-institutional Education Committee” with the belief
that secondary education is key to sustainably transform the
quality of life of the most excluded Mayan-K’iche families in Guatemala’s

How can one student in secondary school be the change agent that pulls their family out of poverty? Isn't that kind of solution expensive? 

   




The solution is a Conditioned Scholarship Program that will:



Increase the number of Maya-K’iche’ youth whose education qualifies them for the national job market;
Increase the number of Maya-K’iche’ children who have access to healthcare during their critical growth period.
Contribute to immediate improvements in nutrition, medical care, and housing conditions for the most excluded families .
Guarantee that these youth have a financial cushion available upon reaching adulthood which can be used to pursue university studies, pursue job interests, etc.

Here's how it works. 


Each of the 27 students receives an annual scholarship, to cover school-related expenses and contribute to improving
nutrition and healthcare by allowing the family to diversify their spending. 

The
scholarship will be awarded as a monthly stipend deposited to the
head-of-household.

A percentage of the
scholarship must be deposited in a savings account for the child. 










We need 27 student sponsors by January. Those students who are not sponsored will drop out of school in when the 2015 school year begins in January. 
An annual sponsorship costs $365 or $1 per day.  It may seem cliché, but that's really how the budget breaks down. 
We would be honored for you to sponsor a student in honor or memory of a loved one, and we thank you for considering giving sponsorships as Christmas gifts this year.

Risks & Challenges
 With youth who live in such precarious circumstances there's always the risk that they may be forced to put their studies on hold despite our support.  We take a preventive approach to overcoming this risk by regularly monitoring each student's situation. This way we can anticipate possible threats and take steps to avoid them.

Our monitoring team holds families and students accountable for properly using the scholarship. Students will be evaluated quarterly.

Regular school attendance is non-negotiable. 
Students who are found to be working during school hours will be dismissed from the program.
Families must show that the costs this scholarship has offset have been used to improve their most immediate needs.

Our motto of ""community united, no family left behind"" means that no one goes the road alone.

<ul> <li> The garden will be used to educate students at a middle school in a
 small village in central Senegal about proper gardening techniques, and
 the vegetables grown will be given for the students at lunch. Many of 
the teachers are interested in working at the garden, and the teachers 
have proposed that  each of seven takes responsibility for the garden 
for one day per week. So far the students have shown initiative by 
clearing out the field, have been following instruction, and have been watering the seedbeds under teacher supervision.</li> </ul>

</ul> </div> </div>","Who We Are:
  I am a 25-year old peace corps volunteer from Boulder, Colorado.  I've been in Kaffrine, Senegal for 2 years, teaching health practices focusing on children's nutrition and malaria prevention.  Kaffrine is a region in central Senegal, with a dry hot climate and a population about 500,000. 






  The garden will be used to educate students at a middle school in a
 small village in central Senegal about proper gardening techniques, and
 the vegetables grown will be given for the students at lunch. Many of 
the teachers are interested in working at the garden, and the teachers 
have proposed that  each of seven takes responsibility for the garden 
for one day per week. So far the students have shown initiative by 
clearing out the field, have been following instruction, and have been watering the seedbeds under teacher supervision. 
What We Need & What You Get
  

 The money will be used to purchase supplies including a fence, hoses, 
watering cans, fertilizer, seeds, labor in preparing seed beds, and 
water barrels. 
We need a minimum of $360 for the project, with any extra going to future supplies including seeds.

   The Impact 
With proper instruction in nutrition and the vegetables from this 
garden, students are learning to be self sufficient.  The Kaffrine 
region is the most malnourished in Senegal, with a significant number of
 small children suffering from all stages of malnutrition.
Risks & Challenges    Ensuring that the ground is well taken of after I depart Senegal will require good training of both the teachers and the students.
I will transfer knowledge of the garden to the Peace Corps volunteer taking over after me in this town.  The teachers are very motivated and I'll make sure that they are well trained an know what to do.

Travel and accommodations for our visiting authors. We want to show Oakland off to a world of writers—and to feed and house them while they are visiting us.


A children’s stage at the Festival. Dedicated entirely to young people and their interests, the OBF Children’s Stage will feature readings, events, games, and crafts in partnership with the Oakland Public Library, Children’s Fairyland, MOCHA, Kidquake, and Chapter 510 & the Dept. of Make Believe.

More than a literary trade show or a series of readings, the Festival asks authors to discuss ideas, to bring their expertise to bear, to share their experience: to challenge, elevate, and inspire one another and those in attendance. 


All events at 2015’s OBF were free and open to the public. Attendees were not asked to make reservations or purchase tickets in advance. The Oakland Book Festival is a community event. We aim to keep it that way, and we need your help to do so. Please give now.

</div><div> <p>Do you know people who have a passionate commitment to education and are continually thwarted?  How can you support them in fulfilling their aspirations?</p>
<p>Every day talented, resourceful people face seemingly insurmountable obstacles to making a real and lasting difference with students.  When standard solutions are ineffective, over time these people whittle down their aspirations, become overwhelmed, cynical and resigned.</p>
<p><b>The Education Network </b>delivers a unique methodology that has enabled thousands of people to consistently achieve and sustain results in education that previously seemed unimaginable, impossible, or too time-consuming to attempt.  We are seeking $5000 to develop the internet capacity to make our methodology and its benefits widely available to people who would otherwise not have access to it.</p>
<p>We will use the funds to create and maintain a new website with components where people can engage in enlivening, thought-provoking discussions that generate innovations, rather than rehash and rearrange old formulas.  And they can discover how to create the kind of environment where learning takes place in the most profound sense of the word - with less struggle and frustration, and more joy and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Daily thousands of individuals and groups, from classroom teachers to national government agencies, grapple with the challenges of redesigning education to meet the needs of all students while simultaneously educating the most complex generation in history.  But with all of the intelligent thinking, purposeful effort, and best intentions, in far too many instances these people are only able to make incremental improvements, or at best periodically produce extraordinary results that can't be sustained.  In short, there is very little real change.  Over time these dedicated, talented people become overwhelmed, cynical, resigned, whittle down their aspirations, and in some cases, leave the profession.</p>
<p><b>THE EDUCATION NETWORK</b>, a national nonprofit 501(c)3 organization, exists to fulfill two objectives.  One, to empower people to realize their fundamental commitment to education - to make a real and lasting difference with each and every student on a day-to-day basis.  Two, to alter the conversations that shape educational reform in this country such that truly substantive changes can be invented and successfully implemented, leading to education reaching its full potential.</p>
<p>To achieve these objectives, The Education Network does not offer a prescribed model or a set of strategies for taking action.  Instead, we have developed a unique methodology to thinking, speaking and listening that allows people to approach issues from a new perspective.  As a result, they have the ability to make what they envision a reality - with less struggle and frustration, and more joy and satisfaction.</p>
<p>We are inviting you to partner with us by providing the funds necessary to make this methodology more widely available.  For over thirty years, The Education Network has offered training programs in a distinctive set of skills that directly impact people's ability to bring a spirit of brilliance and creativity to the complex challenges that exist in classrooms, and to sustain their energy as they navigate the education system.  Thousands of participants in our programs have been able to apply these skills swiftly and naturally to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create learning environments that cultivate student participation and responsibility for their own education, resulting in remarkable gains in achievement.</li>
<li>Provide leadership and inspiration in initiatives resulting in effective collaboration with colleagues, higher quality solutions to instructional problems, and successful implementation of school and district-wide projects.</li>

<p>     A first-year intern in an elementary school:<i> By December I wanted to leave the school.  I hated my students.  I hated my mentor.  I hated everything.  I especially hated staying at school until seven o'clock every night.  I felt like I was working so hard and that nothing ever changed.  When I started ....

When I met Stephanie Waisler, the head of the Unatti Foundation, and visited the home I knew that this was an opportunity that was extremely important. I immediately wanted to help raise money for this foundation. This Spring I am going back to the home. I want to bring the girls money and hope, so they are inspired to strive for their dreams.</li>
<li>This<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> home raises 21 girls, ages 4 to 19 years old. Unatti is soon taking in 4 more girls.

</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">One of the main things that attracted me to this foundation is that the girls are given an incredible chance to get an education. Nepal is a male dominated world, and educating these girls while taking them out of poverty is the next step to fixing issues this country has. </span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
<p>While I was at Unatti the girls got
in a line and told us their aspirations.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My aspiration is to be a cardiovascular
doctor.</span></p>
<p>My aspiration is to be a pilot.</p>
<p>My aspiration is to be a nurse.</p>
<p>My aspiration is to be an air hostess.</p>
<p>This foundation provides a great home
for these girls. We need to help these girls acheive their dreams and they need money to be educated.</p></span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Unatti Home also has an Arts and Music Center, where the homeless children of 
Bhaktapur, Nepal are able to have a creative outlet. 
Children who are trapped in the cycle of extreme
poverty and limited opportunity nevertheless are encouraged to express
themselves honestly, fearlessly, and happily, incorporating both local and
Western artistic approaches and traditions. </span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In addition the Foundation provides jobs and 
free English and Nepali literacy classes to
adult women living in Bhaktapur.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Unatti Foundation lifts up the community through education. It uses this powerful tool to help a poverty stricken community. The foundation is not investing in multiple areas, so it is focused on helping this one important place. It furthers the lives of specific girls, while improving the area. By contributing you can be a main cause in the advancement of this community and these girls lives. You will be able to see the affects and change in 18 girls lives.

Some of which are common necessities, and others are for the new home that Unatti is moving to. (This new place will allow 10 more girls to live at the home). By raising $2000 dollars we will be able to give money to a combination of these needs.</li>

I immediately wanted to help raise money for this foundation. This Spring I am going back to the home. I want to bring the girls money and hope, so they are inspired to strive for their dreams.
This home raises 21 girls, ages 4 to 19 years old. Unatti is soon taking in 4 more girls. Unlike the abusive situations these girls once lived in, this home creates a long-term, loving family. They are provided with a safe and supportive environment to eat, sleep, learn, play and
live. 

One of the main things that attracted me to this foundation is that the girls are given an incredible chance to get an education. Nepal is a male dominated world, and educating these girls while taking them out of poverty is the next step to fixing issues this country has. 

While I was at Unatti the girls got
in a line and told us their aspirations.
My aspiration is to be a cardiovascular

My aspiration is to be a pilot.
My aspiration is to be a nurse.
My aspiration is to be an air hostess.
This foundation provides a great home
for these girls. We need to help these girls acheive their dreams and they need money to be educated.
The Unatti Home also has an Arts and Music Center, where the homeless children of 
Bhaktapur, Nepal are able to have a creative outlet. 
Children who are trapped in the cycle of extreme
poverty and limited opportunity nevertheless are encouraged to express
themselves honestly, fearlessly, and happily, incorporating both local and
Western artistic approaches and traditions. 
In addition the Foundation provides jobs and 
free English and Nepali literacy classes to
adult women living in Bhaktapur.

The Unatti Foundation lifts up the community through education. It uses this powerful tool to help a poverty stricken community. The foundation is not investing in multiple areas, so it is focused on helping this one important place. It furthers the lives of specific girls, while improving the area. By contributing you can be a main cause in the advancement of this community and these girls lives. You will be able to see the affects and change in 18 girls lives. You will contribute to furthering and altering the situation that these girls were born into.
  Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?   What We Need Break it down for folks in more detail:  I hope to raise at least $2000 dollars, because this can pay for a multitude of important supplies for the foundation. Some of which are common necessities, and others are for the new home that Unatti is moving to. (This new place will allow 10 more girls to live at the home). By raising $2000 dollars we will be able to give money to a combination of these needs.
$25.00 feeds a child 3 meals
a day for a month
$40.00 affords nutritious
snacks for 50 students at Unatti Art & Music Center
$100.00 buys water for an
entire year for our Unatti Group Home for Girls
$225.00 buys a new dresser
$300.00 buys a new double bed
$550.00 affords our college
bound girls school supplies, books and food for an entire year.
$1450.00 affords one year sponsorship for a girl in the
Unatti Group Home for Girls. 
$1800.00 buys office furniture for the new Unatti office

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Every year countless undocumented students continue their higher education. Some are privileged to live in states that offer in-state tuition rates or even financial aid to attend college, others have none of that available. Regardless, it is a great challenge to receive a higher education while living undocumented in America. </p>
<p>For this reason the Orange County Dream Team fundraises every year to provide scholarships to undocumented students. Last year OCDT awarded $5000 to undocumented students: eight $500 scholarships to continuing college students, and five $200 scholarships to graduating students. This year we hope to match last year's efforts and continue helping students continue their education as much as we can.</p>

<h3>I need YOU to help me achieve my dream.</h3>
<p>I have been interested in Game Dev and Design since I was just a little kid. I learned to read playing titles like Banjo Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. I spent every minute I could playing every game I could get my hands on. Growing up, I never had a lot of money to throw around for video games, and I believe I've beaten most of the games I do own around 10 times each. As I grew older, I began to see different pieces of gameplay that made them unique, or challenging, or interesting, or addictive. I was repeatedly told by my mother and teachers ""stop playing games, they'll get you nowhere in life. I want you to help me prove them wrong.</p>
<p>The discovery of Full Sail University was one of the best things to happen to me. I still have around 3 or 4 of the tour booklets as I kept asking them to send me information. Full Sail is a driven, direct program that gives you exactly the information you need and provides you with the tools to make your way in the game industry without all the added baggage of traditional college. It's also quite a bit cheaper than traditional college. Unfortunately, even with Government aid and whatever money I can scrape together working minimum wage jobs isn't going to be enough. If I can get together enough money, maybe not even my full goal, I will be able to get my education and move forward in my life. One can only work in Fast Food for so long before you realize it's time to move on up.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where your money will go, and what you'll get for it.</h3>
<p>100% of the money raised here will go towards my tuition and living expenses at Full Sail University. Tuition runs 15,000 a semester, for 5 semesters total to get a bachelors degree. If I go without stopping (they run all summer) I can get my degree in around 2 years. Full Sail has an 80% hiring rate immediately upon graduating, with programs to improve your chances, so I will be working in the game industry in less than 3 years from now.</p>
<p>This means anyone who gets my perks will be able to have an inside man in the gaming industry, someone who will certainly try his best to give you all sorts of delightful information.</p>
<p>Plus, come on, who doesn't want a wish of good fortune?</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Hard Truth</h3>
<p>If I'm honest, without the money this campaign could raise, chances are I'm not going to college. I'm not in a place financially to fund myself and no bank will take me due to my family's unsavory credit history and unfortunate circumstances.</p>
<p>Any amount of money will help me reach my goal.</p>

act as an outlet for the wide and varied influences that have inspired him
throughout his life, drawing in part from Dada collage and classic pop art to
his time as a skateboarder and the bold graphics and artworks he encountered during
this time. His work is a raw presentation of nostalgic imagery blended with contemporary
fragments, resulting in ambiguities and incongruities that reflect the
absurdities of popular culture and a consumer driven society.</p><p>//.<br/></p><p align=""center""><b>A.CE PERK NO.1</b></p><p><b>4x A3 1988 RISO PRINTS, by - A.CE  </b><br/></p><p>

***** STAR PERKS FROM LONDON STREET ARTIST - A.CE *****
A.CE is a London based artist. He has been an active part of the UK street
art scene for over 10 years. In that time his wheat-pasted images have featured
prominently across the urban landscape. Born in London in 1980, A.CE’s works
act as an outlet for the wide and varied influences that have inspired him
throughout his life, drawing in part from Dada collage and classic pop art to
his time as a skateboarder and the bold graphics and artworks he encountered during
this time. His work is a raw presentation of nostalgic imagery blended with contemporary
fragments, resulting in ambiguities and incongruities that reflect the
absurdities of popular culture and a consumer driven society.//.A.CE PERK NO.14x A3 1988 RISO PRINTS, by - A.CE

<span style="""">What is this project</span><span style="""">?</span>
</h2><p>My name is Piia Wirsu and last Saturday I was in Kathmandu for the 7.6 magnitude earthquake which hit Nepal. Since that time I have spoken to many people, all of which have a story to tell which involves some tragedy. In the rural districts of Nepal many villages have been completely wiped out and there is a desperate need for food, clothing, medicine and, in time, rebuilding. This project is designed to raise funds to address these needs. There are so many districts of Nepal which need help and the wish to be able to provide funds to everyone, though sincere, is not realistic so this project is focusing on one or two remote villages in Gorkha district. I have a friend who's family is from this area and that is why I have chosen to direct these efforts here. </p><p>Initially donations will go towards ensuring all basic needs are met, that locals have food, water, clothing and shelter. Once this is achieved funds will be directed towards clean up and rebuilding. Food, water and clothing will be purchased and transported to this village to ensure all donations go directly towards helping those in the village and no money is lost in administration fees or is misdirected. All work for this project is being conducted voluntarily. Materials for building homes can be sourced locally and for free in the district, however money is needed to employ labourers to source the materials and then build. </p><p><br/></p><h2><b style="""">Why donate here? </b></h2><p>A story I have heard again and again speaking to locals while in Nepal is that countries keep promising aid but it never seems to reach those who need it most. As one person put it, ""it feeds the stomach of the government here"". Any donation made to this project will go 100% towards helping those who need it, there are no administration costs or bureaucracy which can absorb the funds. </p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Why am I doing this?</b></h2><p>After the earthquake I was overwhelmed by the generosity and caring of those around me, although many people have lost houses, family and friends the Nepalese people that I interacted with always ensured I had food, water and a place to take shelter. I slept alongside locals for three nights in the open following the earthquake and was made to feel like an adopted relative of those families around me. I would like to return the goodwill which was shown to me and my contacts in the Ghorka region allow me to provide aid relief there. Your donation will help me do this. </p><p><br/></p><h2><b>How will your donation be managed?</b></h2><p>Your donation will be managed and budgeted to ensure the maximum can be pulled from each dollar. Funds in Nepal will be managed by Sandesh Tamang who has experience in working within budgets and accounting for spending. Sandesh has worked as an expedition sirdar in charge of trip finances for many years and is a trusted friend who can act as the Nepal link to ensure assistance is given to those who most need it. </p><p><br/></p><h2><b>How much do we need?</b></h2><p>I aim to raise $1000 dollars, although any more would only help to provide ongoing support. My concern is that once the news dies down and people forget about what happened the people of Nepal will find that aid falls away also. This is a time when they will need just as much if not more as they struggle with food shortages and the mammoth effort of cleaning up and rebuilding. I would love you to help me continue to provide support after the memories have faded by donating anything you can to help me reach or exceed this target. If the target is not reached the money will still be directed as detailed above. </p><p><br/></p><h2><b>What do you get for your donation? </b></h2><p>A personal thank you card so you know your donation is appreciated and you can follow the progress of the project on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/tasnepalrebuild"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/tasnepalrebuild</a></p><p><br/></p><h2><b>A final note</b></h2><p>Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated, not just by me but by those who receive the support from it. Giving is all the more rewarding when given to those who expect nothing. Even if you can only spare a dollar, please donate, it takes us a step closer to our goal.</p><p>If you are unable to give that is okay, we all have expenses, but please pass on this project to others who may be able to donate, share and help to build the momentum through which great things can happen! I have been shown in the 72 hours since the earthquake that disaster also provides the opportunity for great humanity and generosity of spirit to surface, please help to return this spirit, any help is met with gratitude. </p><p><br/></p></div>","What is this project?

There are so many districts of Nepal which need help and the wish to be able to provide funds to everyone, though sincere, is not realistic so this project is focusing on one or two remote villages in Gorkha district. I have a friend who's family is from this area and that is why I have chosen to direct these efforts here. Initially donations will go towards ensuring all basic needs are met, that locals have food, water, clothing and shelter. Once this is achieved funds will be directed towards clean up and rebuilding. Food, water and clothing will be purchased and transported to this village to ensure all donations go directly towards helping those in the village and no money is lost in administration fees or is misdirected. All work for this project is being conducted voluntarily. Materials for building homes can be sourced locally and for free in the district, however money is needed to employ labourers to source the materials and then build. Why donate here? A story I have heard again and again speaking to locals while in Nepal is that countries keep promising aid but it never seems to reach those who need it most. As one person put it, ""it feeds the stomach of the government here"". Any donation made to this project will go 100% towards helping those who need it, there are no administration costs or bureaucracy which can absorb the funds. Why am I doing this?After the earthquake I was overwhelmed by the generosity and caring of those around me, although many people have lost houses, family and friends the Nepalese people that I interacted with always ensured I had food, water and a place to take shelter. I slept alongside locals for three nights in the open following the earthquake and was made to feel like an adopted relative of those families around me. I would like to return the goodwill which was shown to me and my contacts in the Ghorka region allow me to provide aid relief there. Your donation will help me do this. How will your donation be managed?Your donation will be managed and budgeted to ensure the maximum can be pulled from each dollar. Funds in Nepal will be managed by Sandesh Tamang who has experience in working within budgets and accounting for spending. Sandesh has worked as an expedition sirdar in charge of trip finances for many years and is a trusted friend who can act as the Nepal link to ensure assistance is given to those who most need it. How much do we need?I aim to raise $1000 dollars, although any more would only help to provide ongoing support. My concern is that once the news dies down and people forget about what happened the people of Nepal will find that aid falls away also. This is a time when they will need just as much if not more as they struggle with food shortages and the mammoth effort of cleaning up and rebuilding. I would love you to help me continue to provide support after the memories have faded by donating anything you can to help me reach or exceed this target. If the target is not reached the money will still be directed as detailed above. What do you get for your donation? A personal thank you card so you know your donation is appreciated and you can follow the progress of the project on www.facebook.com/tasnepalrebuildA final noteAny assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated, not just by me but by those who receive the support from it. Giving is all the more rewarding when given to those who expect nothing. Even if you can only spare a dollar, please donate, it takes us a step closer to our goal.If you are unable to give that is okay, we all have expenses, but please pass on this project to others who may be able to donate, share and help to build the momentum through which great things can happen! I have been shown in the 72 hours since the earthquake that disaster also provides the opportunity for great humanity and generosity of spirit to surface, please help to return this spirit, any help is met with gratitude.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<div><h3>Our Campaign</h3></div>
<p>Hi friends, family and the community as a whole! Meals that Matter is made up of 4 college students that attend the University of Tennessee. We are working together with the Boys and Girls Clubs of the Tennessee Valley, BGCTNV, to raise money for meals for the students that are a part of this organization.This is important to us because not only do we care about bettering our community, but we want to give these kids successful futures and healthy lifestyles. The money donated goes directly to the kids and it will make a much bigger impact on them than it will to give up 3 of your dollar bills!</p>
</div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3><p>It takes about $3 a day for them to feed a child at their club. Our starting goal is to raise $1000, totaling to feeding 333 kids per day. BGCTNV serve around 1500 kids a day, so going over the goal of $1000 will just mean that extra money will go toward feeding even more kids. A simple $3 donation can feed a kid for an entire day-and imagine how much we can grow on that. </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>If we do not reach our goal of $1000, all the money donated will still go to feeding the kids-so really it’s just the more the merrier!

We aim to allow you to see exactly where your money is going and who it is affecting.

<p>
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p>
<p>What I remember
most about my childhood is the patina of fear that hung over every experience.
Under former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Egyptians were not allowed to
question the government, let alone criticize it. An opaque system of governance
built on fear; we never knew what could get us thrown in jail or branded
as enemies of the state. Such fear permeated every childhood experience so much so
that I think my interest in journalism was born out of an outrage about that fear
and a deep desire to break it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Indeed of my five
siblings, I, the second born, was considered the family rebel. Where my parents
urged us to keep quiet, I insisted on pushing the limits of both family and my
country. I would express my frustration with the daily ills of Egypt, and the
government’s unwillingness to address them. Yet when I so much as  mentioned the name
of Mubarak, my father would bounce from his seat, grab all the phones and hide
them under the cushions.  Looking at all of us, he would whisper, “Even
if the phones are switched off, they can hear us.”</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This was my
Egypt, a nation full of rules and bureaucracy that didn’t make sense, that
didn’t advance the lives of Egyptians. Throughout Mubarak’s tenure, where the
quality of life improved for an elite few, for the majority life around them
was deteriorating – in the schools, public health, housing, the roads and the
like.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>That one could not
even acknowledge the decay before us was unacceptable to me, so much so I used
to protest in school against government practices for years, leading to my suspension.
I didn’t realize it at the time but even then I was a journalist, confident in
the power of speaking out and reporting the truth.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Egypt that only
provided for a few played out on a national stage and in my everyday
experiences. “You are a girl, you can’t do this,” I frequently heard. At
schools, the boys played on the bigger playground and took better school trips.
At home, my father often rejected my pleas to try something new, saying, “My
girls don’t do such things. When you get married, your husband can decide.”</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My first story in 2008 was covering a strike led by government opponents trying to seek change. I had to sneak out of the house to bypass my parents who urged me not to attend.  I came back that night and told them what I had done and seen, in the hopes that it would break the wall of fear that had defined their generation.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Given such experiences, I wonder if it was not inevitable that my generation would no longer
accept such norms. Through the Internet we were exposed to a world very different from that which our parents knew. Upon the 2011 uprising that led to Mubarak’s
fall, the old Egypt was confronted with a new reality.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>To break the
shackles of fear is itself a form of liberation, I believe. No longer
in fear of what the switched off phones may capture, I now ask the questions

What I Need 





Tourism has collapsed in Egypt due to
our three-year turmoil, hurting my family’s shop in a tourist market. I also
live in a society where people do not pay that much for college, and I have little
savings that would allow me to cover my living expenses.
I need a total of $14,000;  $2000 for
     books, $2780 for transportation, $6000 for Other expenses ( food,
     utilities, equipment, cell..etc), $3100  for heath insurance
      and $290 for activity fee.

My Story 





What I remember
most about my childhood is the patina of fear that hung over every experience.
Under former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Egyptians were not allowed to
question the government, let alone criticize it. An opaque system of governance
built on fear; we never knew what could get us thrown in jail or branded
as enemies of the state. Such fear permeated every childhood experience so much so
that I think my interest in journalism was born out of an outrage about that fear
and a deep desire to break it.


Indeed of my five
siblings, I, the second born, was considered the family rebel. Where my parents
urged us to keep quiet, I insisted on pushing the limits of both family and my
country. I would express my frustration with the daily ills of Egypt, and the
government’s unwillingness to address them. Yet when I so much as  mentioned the name
of Mubarak, my father would bounce from his seat, grab all the phones and hide
them under the cushions.  Looking at all of us, he would whisper, “Even
if the phones are switched off, they can hear us.”


This was my
Egypt, a nation full of rules and bureaucracy that didn’t make sense, that
didn’t advance the lives of Egyptians. Throughout Mubarak’s tenure, where the
quality of life improved for an elite few, for the majority life around them
was deteriorating – in the schools, public health, housing, the roads and the
like.


That one could not
even acknowledge the decay before us was unacceptable to me, so much so I used
to protest in school against government practices for years, leading to my suspension.
I didn’t realize it at the time but even then I was a journalist, confident in
the power of speaking out and reporting the truth.


The Egypt that only
provided for a few played out on a national stage and in my everyday
experiences. “You are a girl, you can’t do this,” I frequently heard. At
schools, the boys played on the bigger playground and took better school trips.
At home, my father often rejected my pleas to try something new, saying, “My
girls don’t do such things. When you get married, your husband can decide.”


My first story in 2008 was covering a strike led by government opponents trying to seek change. I had to sneak out of the house to bypass my parents who urged me not to attend.  I came back that night and told them what I had done and seen, in the hopes that it would break the wall of fear that had defined their generation.


Given such experiences, I wonder if it was not inevitable that my generation would no longer
accept such norms. Through the Internet we were exposed to a world very different from that which our parents knew. Upon the 2011 uprising that led to Mubarak’s
fall, the old Egypt was confronted with a new reality.


To break the
shackles of fear is itself a form of liberation, I believe. No longer
in fear of what the switched off phones may capture, I now ask the questions
that once lingered in my mind to both Egyptians and Americans
alike. In April 2013, I attended a White House briefing just days after the Boston
bombing. As press spokesman Jay Carney repeatedly dodged journalists’
questions, one kept coming up in my mind. The White House called what happened
at the end of the Boston marathon an act of terror, citing that a child was among
the dead. But what about the death of children in places like Afghanistan at
the hands of U.S. drone operators? Was that too a form of terrorism, I
wondered.


So I asked Carney,
and our exchange caused a national stir. For me, the girl of parents who spent
their lives in fear, the experience was ultimately a breakthrough. I am part of
a new generation that knows that only through speaking out, whether at home or on the street or at the White House, can a life of fear subside.

As part of the leadership team at Makarios Community School, I am most excited to create a haven where every member has the room and space to breathe freely. In this space, students will be able to grow to be strong adaptable individuals capable of being self-driven towards what ever goal they desire.

In January 2011 I heard a NPR program about Brooklyn Free School and I was intrigued.  I wished I could have gone to a school like that and wanted to ensure that my children had the opportunity to enjoy interested directed learning. I began reading about various free and democratic schools, visiting campuses and talking to others that are interested in alternative methods of education. Over the past year, my children and I have participated in a democratic free learning co-op with other home education families.  It has been a fun and rewarding experience.  I am really looking forward to having a campus where students may enjoy this style of learning on a daily basis!  
Makarios Community School is sponsored by Makarios Ministries, Inc. a non-profit advocacy organization that exist to support the community through programs and partnerships.  Makarios Community School has no religious affiliation and will be open to all students and their families that value alternative democratic education.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
<p>We are a group of Singaporean undergraduates, who lead Hall 10 (a university's residential hall) Overseas Community Involvement Programme, and are passionate about contributing to the global community. We have been working with HOPE Worldwide for the past 6 years in an effort to raise the level of education and help the needy children in Indonesia.</p>
<p>This year, we want to do more! We will be going to Indonesia from 3rd to 16th June 2013 to not only teach the kids basic English, but to refurbish their schools as well. We have noticed that not all the children have a full set of stationary and are looking at providing them with their own sets too. We are now trying to raise funds to better help the children that we will be visiting in the villages and English Training Centres (ETCs) of Hope.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>We believe that everyone, no matter how young, has a part to play. </p>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>You may question, how can we help the children in just 2 weeks?</p>
<p>In the 2 weeks, we aim to inspire and help the children to learn English by showing them that it can be fun to learn. When they are able to grasp this language, their chances of employment greatly increase, and over time, this helps with the country's economic advancement. </p>
<p>We will also help them refurbish their schools to cultivate a better, more conducive, learning environment. We will also be building recycling bins to inculcate a sense of environmental awareness. By instilling this attitude in the young, we hope that they will grow up to lead the country in a more socially responsible way.</p>
<p>Although 2 weeks is not long, this is ultimately a long-term project that that we will continue with for years to come. </p>
<h3>What do we need?</h3>
<p>Your help! Every little bit counts. The money that we are campaigning for will go directly into funding programme materials and construction materials for our 2 weeks in Indonesia. The breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p>Construction materials: $500</p>
<p>Stationary for 500 children: $1000</p>
<p>Art and craft materials: $800</p>
<p>Recycle Bin materials: $400</p>
<p>English worksheets: $300</p>
<p> </p>
<p>TOTAL: $3000</p>
<p>Through this platform, we are hoping to raise at least $1500 to give the children the opportunities they deserve. With every dollar you give, you help to make their lives a little better. Everyone deserves a chance to dream and grow. Only education can help the children to be so much more. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What do you stand to gain?</h3>
<p>We don't have much we can offer but if you donate more than $10, we will send you a handmade Thank You card from the children themselves!</p>

This year, we want to do more! We will be going to Indonesia from 3rd to 16th June 2013 to not only teach the kids basic English, but to refurbish their schools as well. We have noticed that not all the children have a full set of stationary and are looking at providing them with their own sets too. We are now trying to raise funds to better help the children that we will be visiting in the villages and English Training Centres (ETCs) of Hope.
Why?
We believe that everyone, no matter how young, has a part to play. 
How?
You may question, how can we help the children in just 2 weeks?
In the 2 weeks, we aim to inspire and help the children to learn English by showing them that it can be fun to learn. When they are able to grasp this language, their chances of employment greatly increase, and over time, this helps with the country's economic advancement. 
We will also help them refurbish their schools to cultivate a better, more conducive, learning environment. We will also be building recycling bins to inculcate a sense of environmental awareness. By instilling this attitude in the young, we hope that they will grow up to lead the country in a more socially responsible way.
Although 2 weeks is not long, this is ultimately a long-term project that that we will continue with for years to come. 
What do we need?
Your help! Every little bit counts. The money that we are campaigning for will go directly into funding programme materials and construction materials for our 2 weeks in Indonesia. The breakdown is as follows:
Construction materials: $500
Stationary for 500 children: $1000
Art and craft materials: $800
Recycle Bin materials: $400
English worksheets: $300
 
TOTAL: $3000
Through this platform, we are hoping to raise at least $1500 to give the children the opportunities they deserve. With every dollar you give, you help to make their lives a little better. Everyone deserves a chance to dream and grow. Only education can help the children to be so much more. 
 
What do you stand to gain?
We don't have much we can offer but if you donate more than $10, we will send you a handmade Thank You card from the children themselves!

(Please note that all donations are in USD as this site doesn't accept SGD.)

Help us in other ways too!

<h3><br/></h3>
<p>My name is Coach Chris Glasgow. I have been coaching these special group of young men since they were seven and eight years old. They are now 12 and 13 years old. In the neighborhood that these young men come from their is a lot of gang violence and recruitment for gang members. I have been amazed that our team has mostly stayed together with the limited funding we have for our football program. Before my son wanted to play football I had no idea how to coach or any desire to be a Coach. Like any other parent I use to take my son and stand on the side watching them practice. One evening one of the Coaches asked me if I wanted to volunteer as a Coach, since I was always at practice. I saw this as an opportunity to spend time with my sons, each on a different team for the organization. </p>
<p>At first I was just your basic helping out dad but after awhile I really started getting into  coaching the kids and realized it was my responsibility as a coach and father figure, to some of them, to  impact how these kids grew into young men. I am a firm believer that ""it takes A Village to Raise a Child"". I have watched these young men mature and gain confidence in themselves as well as learning how to work with others for a common goal. These young men had endured years of losing until they turned the corner about 5 years ago and began a winning tradition in our Bronx based community sports organization.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">For the last 4 years our team has been invited to the National Youth Football Championships held in Florida. The same youth championship games that have been recently featured on ESPN. We would be the first team in our Organizations 10 years of existence to make the trip to Florida and represent our community in the Bronx. We have lost many of our players who played for our organization to the allure of street life. Even with our success we have not been able to translate the wins into large group of kids playing football and leaving the gang and street life alone. I believe with this kind of exposure on a National stage giving us a chance to tell our story, we can get many more children and their parents involved in our community based organizations. That would give our kids some of the tools needed to be a success in any arena whether it be in school, business or life in general.</span></p>
<p>With your contributions you would be fulfilling these 16 young men dreams as well as helping a community realize that through sports and community based organizations that children can develop the confidence and self assurance to rely on positive influences then the glamorization of gangs and street life. For these 16 young men the memory of going to the National Youth Football Championships in Florida would last a life time. Thank You for your help in Making Their Dream Come True........</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have a total of 16 young men that would make the trip to Florida for the National Youth Football Championship. Though our organization has been fundraising all year long much of the funds generated were to keep up with the organization expenses. This team would be the first team to go to Florida to represent our organization as well as our community. So far, the combined efforts of the parents/children selling candies and the selling of our tee shirts we have raised 55% of the monies needed to make our children and the organizations Dream Come True! </p>
<p>Here is a Breakdown of Cost per Child for 7 days (December 9-15) :</p>
<p>Airfare (round-trip) per child - $197 + $32(taxes) = $229</p>
<p>Hotel Accommodations per Child (4 in a room)  - $175</p>
<p>Food allotment per child - $120 </p>
<p>Ground Transportation per child - $100</p>
<p>Total per child for 7 days - $624</p>
<p>Grand Total for 16 members of the Team - $9984</p>
<p>We have raised approx. $5300</p>
<p>If we fall short of our campaign goal all of the proceeds that have been raised will go towards the expenses for the trip. Any amount of money would help in reducing the young men expenses.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to our cause you will not only make the dreams of 16 young men, our organization and the community we represent come true but you will help in the reshaping of the ideology within the community to not accept things as status quo involving the gang violence, obesity and lack of programs for our youth. We have launched similar projects before for the betterment of our community. So far, we have seen success in gaining the trust of our community and gaining the ear of our political representation. But we all know that you need funding to get any project really going and that is where we have hit a brick wall. Hopefully, through the success of this campaign we can begin to put some monies behind the ideas we have developed that would help the youth in our area develop into successful young men and women. Their is nothing better then seeing young men and women feel good about their accomplishments and a community that rallied around them. For that we want to THANK YOU.</p>

<p><span><strong>Akamai means intelligence or common sense in Hawaiian.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Akamai Learning will have a nourishing home-base where students can strengthen their nature-based studies with modern technology.<strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><span>I am Felicia Cowden, the school director of Akamai Learning, which is essentially alternative middle school supporting families that identify as home schoolers. My longer-term background has been in business, engineering and public policy. My experience of running a group home-school program for four years, is that students learn the most vibrantly when they are engaged in applied science, math and social studies. They learn WHY and WHEN they need the skills that straight academic study generally only demonstrates the WHAT and HOW of a math or science application. Modern financial and civic literacy is entwined with nature-based and Hawaiian cultural learning from the mountain to the ocean.</span></p>
<p><span>Many students are physical learners and can become frustrated by being trapped in a desk with a necessary strong set of rules five days a week. Akamai Learning has evolved to placing an emphasis in nature, grounding the students in food production and directly managing the aspects of nature around them. We go on field trips to understand the relationship of the modern world, the natural world, the subjects we study and our responsibility for building a resilient future.</span></p>
<p><span>Akamai Learning has been a smaller program based out of my home, often learning traditional skills at Waipa which is a 1600-acre Hawaiian culturally-based learning center. This year, we are taking the leap from having an Akamai Backyard to having an Akamai Ahupua`a (watershed valley) by moving from my house to Waipa’s campus. This year we have 25 students who will be experiencing traditional, more vocational practices with Waipa’s staff in their farming and wilderness areas. This learning will be complimented with more core academics, modern technology and direct instruction in the new building. Fresh food from our growing area will be available for the students to graze on in our kitchenette. In order to service families of all economic ranges, we have a minimal tuition. We need help furnishing the new learning center.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The Waipa Community has been blessed with a beautiful new building funded by Kamehameha Schools. It now needs to be furnished and Akamai Learning is its first regular user. This will be a community classroom as well as our own.</span></p>
<p>We need about $2,500 to set the room up with communication technology. This includes the internet cable, a large, wall-mounted television/computer screen, an interfacing laptop computer, modems and routers. Another $2,500 is for the basic furnishings of large whiteboards for different walls in the room, tables, chairs, wall-mounted maps, locking storage cabinet for student work, cooking equipment for the kitchenette, yoga balls, some hand-crafted furnishings like big bean bag chairs, a recycled palette couch, and a whiteboard-surfaced table.</p>
<p>The rooms will be flexible, comfortable and have a number of multi-directional learning areas which can be almost swept aside to empty the room for a hula halau and other open space uses. The video screen will assist many users in making robust group presentations.</p>
<p>The $5000 amount represents a collective furnishing cost. If there is more money, we can invest in more quality equipment. If there is less money, we still have moved in the direction of having what we need.</p>
<p>This community building is available to other organizations through making reservations with Waipa Foundation. <a href=""http://www.waipafoundation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.waipafoundation.org</a></p>
<p><strong>Setting an example for culturally appropriate empowered learning</strong></p>
<p><span>First and foremost, we want to make a difference for any student that is directly in our program to learn in a direction that inspires their passion and sense of purpose. Their education embraces much more than what they experience directly on campus and inclusively respects their family and life circumstances. We work to not only help them to build their dreams but also to identify them. There is a lot of freedom and self-direction in this program as students begin to recognize that all of their life is their school. </span></p>
<p><span>Student-directed learning is the natural trend for education away from teacher-centered schools. It is more effective, affordable and relevant. Learning from experience in the real world that is tied to academics is retained. The educational standards set in the urban settings of Washington D.C. or even Honolulu have a serious disconnect to what matters to a child in a rural island environment. Ask any surfer how much they are learning when they are out in the water and are those lessons of value.</span></p>

Comic books and Superheroes have the magic of captivating any kid's undivided attention. With Marvel and DC churning out blockbusters year after year, it is no surprise to know the impact they have on the young minds. Cinemics is an attempt to tap the potentials of comic books and superheroes and use them to make learning a fun filled experience.Cinemics has a three point system:Motivation: Each course will have a comic strip in it taking the member on a superhero adventure journey. The comic strip will stop at a suspense juncture and you can proceed further only if you watch a educational (Science, Math or Coding) tutorial video and successfully pass the assignment quiz. So, if you want to know what happens next in the comic book, you better pass the assignment!Accountability: Superhero power points are assigned to member with completion of different sections of the course. Superhero board will display the weekly, monthly and yearly leader in the board. The more frequently you work towards the completion of your course, the more points you earn taking you to the top of the board. Compare your superhero power points with others, compete in the arena and become a leader of the superhero team!Creativity:With each important section of course completion you unlock the potential to build your own superhero. It begins with selecting the power of your superhero, selecting the costume, side kick and many more. Explore the creative part of your brain while learning to code.We are a team of dedicated technologists and creative artists working towards making learning fun. We have worked towards designing our own superhero characters with complete storyboard and character design. Find below some of our exciting characters:
Name: RUDRA
Power: Concentrated Infrared Radiation from his eyes can burst things to ashes. He is the commander in chief and strategist of the team.Name: AGNIPower:He is well trained in martial arts based on animal style. He can manifest himself through fire i.e. he can move from one place to another fast through fire (just like how forest fire spreads).Name: VAYUPower:He can run as fast as the wind due to his ability to harness wave power.Name: JALPower:

<h3>Who I am..</h3>
<p>My name is Pete Marchica, and I am the founding festival Director of the Rose Park Bluegrass Festival. For the last 10 years I've worked as a bartender here in Long Beach, CA, and loved doing it for mainly two reasons: 1) I seemed to be pretty good at it. 2) I loved that the main component of my job was meeting and working with new people. Although as much as I was attached to that line of work, and loved doing it, I wanted something more. I realized that as much as I enjoyed meeting new people and seeing smiles on their faces when I poured them a libation, I knew that the job had it's limits. I wanted to travel, I wanted to be creative, and I wanted to use the ideas that constantly ran through my head to help increase the level of happiness for people in this world. Basically, I had outgrown my job, and knew that the act of pouring somebody an alcoholic beverage was only a temporary fix, for improving the level of happiness of others around me. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Here's what I want to do</h3>
<p>This Campaign will directly fund the production of the 2nd Annual Rose Park Bluegrass Festival. The event is a collaberation with the Rose Park Neighborhood Association (RPNA), which is committed to maintaining and improving the quality of life for the residents of the Rose Park community. It's a free festival, directly in the middle of a densely populated area of Long Beach, CA. </p>

<div>The festival itself is more than just bluegrass music, arts &amp; crafts, delicious food, games, and prizes; it's a living entity that draws people out of their homes, and into the presence of their neighbors. It's a conversation starter. The Festival is a place where friendships begin, and relationships blossom under a common, shared experience. It's not about bluegrass music. It's not about good food. It's not about contests and prizes. The Rose Park Bluegrass Festival is about enjoying the company of your fellow neighbor, and being happy.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p>Through funding the production of this festival, your contribution will ultimately yield:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 solid hours of Free Bluegrass music</li>
<li>Free arts, crafts and activities for children</li>
<li>A measurable level of gross domestic happiness for the residents of Long Beach, California.</li>

<h3>What We Need..</h3>
<p>In order for an event of this magnitude to continue to be free, we need your help to pay for the much needed infrastructure and the highly skilled talent of those who help organize it. Here are some of the things that your contribution will specifically fund:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bluegrass Bands (you gotta pay the musicians)</li>
<li>The staging, soundboard and electrical power generator</li>
<li>Street Closures (so people can roam freely, without having to worry about cars)</li>
<li>The Free Bike Valet (So folks can park their bikes - worry free)</li>
<li>Porta Pottys (so folks have somewhere to use the restroom)</li>
<li>The countless Permits required (as much as these are needed for the safety of attendees, they are very, very expensive)</li>
<li>The organizing staff (web designers, graphic designers, adminstrative assistants, interns, etc.)</li>
<li>Advertising (both online &amp; in-print)</li>
<li>Office supplies: paper clips, file folders, ink cartidges, etc. (not everything can be done by email)</li>
<li>Food and refreshments for the volunteers on the day of the event</li>
<li>And tons more....</li>

<div>In addition to the banjo/fiddle contest that takes place on stage, the pie-eating contest, and the make-your-own instrument workshop for kids, this festival pays homage to what is now a very special tradition. Before the final band performs, 4 outstanding residents of the Rose Park community will be recognized during the ""Distinguished Roses"" designation. All recipients are nominated because of their undeniable committment to the neighborhood, and will receive a long stem rose, a framed award certificate, and a commemorative brick with their name engraved, to be placed on the walkway in Rose Park. The bricks will be purchased from the Rose Park Neighborhood Association (RPNA) a recognized non-profit 501(c)3.</div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Chace Topperwien was diagnosed with AML (Acute Myeloid Leukaemia), a rare and agressive form of leukemia, on the 14th of March 2011, just 3 days before his second birthday.</p>
<p>He has been battling the disease for 12 months, undergoing months of brutal chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant in July last year. However, just days after Christmas, the Topperwien's learnt Chace's leukemia had returned and were told there was nothing more doctors could do (and that Chace likely had only weeks to live).</p>
<p>His parents, Keri and Ryan, desperately searched the internet for anything that could help their only son, and just when Chace was at his worst they discovered a promosing new drug trial in Britain. The drug blocks the activity of a group of proteins called aurora kinases that control cell growth, inhibiting the growth of cancer cells.</p>
<p>After spending his third birthday in Auckland's Starship Hospital (tha makes it 2/3) Chace and his parents have flown halfway around the world, away from the support of their whanau, to join the hugely costly experimental drug trial which is the last desperate hope to prolong his life long enough for a second transplant to be attempted.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The trial is going to cost the Topperwien's up to $423,000. They have flown to the UK with just $69,000 (raised for just such an opportunity in 2011), less than a quarter of the amount required.</p>
<p>The family are facing a bill of at least £13,470 (approx $27,000 NZD) for just the first 10 days of the trial (this covers the cost of the hospital bed, 2 Echo tests, 2 chest x-rays, an ECG, plasma, 1 unit of platelets every 2-3 days, haematology, chemistry, cross match x 2, BMA x 2, 2 histograms, HA7). And that does not include Keri and Ryan's own living expenses or unexpected hiccups like the recently discovered kink in his port, which needs to be replaced at additional time and expense.</p>
<p>All of the funds raised go straight to the Topperwien's and will be used to cover the expenses of his trial and their living costs in the UK.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Treatment on this trial is Chace's only hope of survival. Chace is adorable, adventurous and life without him in it is unimaginable. Keri and Ryan are beautiful, intellegent, and amazingly positive people who have touched the lives of many, both before and after this saga began. This is just the kind of whanau we want to support and foster in Aotearoa.</p>

The Right to Learn accomplishes this mission primarily through its funding of School of Louise’s Dreams, where over 200 pre-elementary and elementary students are provided with everything they need to effectively receive an education.</h4><h4 style=""font-weight: normal;"">Over seventeen years ago, our school began as a simple dream of one woman. During Louise Brunberg’s first visit to the town of Nagarote, she witnessed the poverty suffered by many of the children. As a retired teacher, she was especially saddened when she learned that many of the children could not attend the public schools because they were unable to afford basic necessities like school supplies, shoes, or even breakfast. It was then that Louise decided that she would dedicate the rest of her life to ensuring that those same children would be able to attend school, regardless of their circumstances. Today, The Right to Learn works to continue our founder’s dream.</h4><h4 style=""font-weight: normal;"">Inspired by the ideals of the organization, I began working as a Development Intern for The Right to Learn in April of 2011. Using Social Media, I have been helping to bolster The Right to Learn's internet identity, gaining the organization as much positive awareness as possible. At the end of the summer, I will journey to Nagarote with Louise Brunberg herself, to begin a Teaching Internship. After many months of working on the business side of this non-profit, it will be incredibly rewarding to experience The Right to Learn's work first hand.</h4><h2 style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</h2><h4 style=""font-weight: normal;"">Providing free education for an entire student body is no mean feat, so we are not always able to provide the students of The School of Louise's Dreams with everything they deserve. We hope to increase the presence of the Montessori method in our classrooms, in order to enhance the students' overall educational experience. After all, these pupils, with their well rounded academic careers, will soon be the leaders of their communities and country. </h4><h2 style=""font-weight: bold;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2><h4 style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our campaign goal is to enhance the implementation of the Montessori Method in our classrooms. When I visit Nagarote, I hope to bring interactive, advanced materials for the students, such as craft supplies, books, building materials, games, and outdoor play equipment.</h4><h4 style=""font-weight: normal;"">To demonstrate our appreciation of generous donors, givers of $25.00 or more will receive a colorful photo collage of the students of The School of Louse's Dreams.</h4><div><br/></div><div>

During Louise Brunberg’s first visit to the town of Nagarote, she witnessed the poverty suffered by many of the children. As a retired teacher, she was especially saddened when she learned that many of the children could not attend the public schools because they were unable to afford basic necessities like school supplies, shoes, or even breakfast. It was then that Louise decided that she would dedicate the rest of her life to ensuring that those same children would be able to attend school, regardless of their circumstances. Today, The Right to Learn works to continue our founder’s dream.Inspired by the ideals of the organization, I began working as a Development Intern for The Right to Learn in April of 2011. Using Social Media, I have been helping to bolster The Right to Learn's internet identity, gaining the organization as much positive awareness as possible. At the end of the summer, I will journey to Nagarote with Louise Brunberg herself, to begin a Teaching Internship. After many months of working on the business side of this non-profit, it will be incredibly rewarding to experience The Right to Learn's work first hand.The ImpactProviding free education for an entire student body is no mean feat, so we are not always able to provide the students of The School of Louise's Dreams with everything they deserve. We hope to increase the presence of the Montessori method in our classrooms, in order to enhance the students' overall educational experience. After all, these pupils, with their well rounded academic careers, will soon be the leaders of their communities and country. What We Need & What You GetOur campaign goal is to enhance the implementation of the Montessori Method in our classrooms. When I visit Nagarote, I hope to bring interactive, advanced materials for the students, such as craft supplies, books, building materials, games, and outdoor play equipment.To demonstrate our appreciation of generous donors, givers of $25.00 or more will receive a colorful photo collage of the students of The School of Louse's Dreams.
How Else You Can Help
One of the many terrific outcomes of this campaign will be increased publicity for The Right to Learn. The more people know about our mission, the more sustainable we become.

<p><strong>FALLEN NOT FORGOTTEN</strong></p>
<p>Fallen Not Forgotten, Inc. was founded in October of 2012.  Since that
time we have been able to successfully raise enough funds to establish three
small college scholarships:  Our first was given to Macae, the son of USMC
Sergeant Joseph Wrightsman that was killed in action (KIA) in Afghanistan on 18
July 2010. Our second was established for the three-year-old daughter of
Sergeant Enrique Mondragon (USA) who was KIA on Christmas Eve, 24 December 2012
while conducting dismounted patrols in Baraki Barak, Afghanistan.
 And our third one, established for the now 7-year-old daughter of 1<sup>st</sup>
Lieutenant Jason Mann who died while serving in Afghanistan 17 July 2008 as
part of the 24<sup>th</sup> MEU.  At this
time, Fallen Not Forgotten asks for your continued support in celebration of
our service members and their families who have paid the ultimate sacrifice on
our behalf.  </p>
<p><strong>A CALL TO ARMS</strong></p>
<p>In July 2008, after laying a friend to rest that was killed in action while
conducting combat operations in support of Operation IRAQ FREEDOM, I was
discussing with a mutual friend about various programs available to the
families of service members that were wounded or killed in action
(WIA/KIA).  It was during this conversation that his mother innocently
offered the statement “Well I always thought you all took care of your
own!”  For the past few years the loss of that friend and unfortunately
additional ones since then has fueled Fallen Not Forgotten to take action and
attempt to do just that!</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Defense reports as of May 2, 2014 there were 3, 481
KIA and 31,941 WIA in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, 38 KIA and 297 WIA in
support of Operation NEW DAWN and 1,805 KIA and 19,551 WIA in support of
Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. </p>
<p><strong>COLLEGE FOR CALI</strong></p>
<p>As some of you may recall, this past winter during our “mini Goal” Fallen
Not Forgotten was able to raise funds for several iPad mini’s!  It was at that time that we were introduced
to the Baldwin Family and a gold star child – Cali.  Cali is the daughter of Chief Baldwin who was a Sea Bee in the US Navy.  In speaking with her mother, I was informed
that Cali would be graduating from high school this year with the intent on
attending college next year! </p>
<p>Given a computer, some time to think while baking in the 100 degree
Djiboutian hot sun, and a wifi connection…FNF felt compelled to see what we
could do to assist in paying for Cali’s first year of college (though we always
welcome more).  In doing a quick review
of Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College Summary of Per Semester Expenses
for full time students, I quickly realized just how attainable this goal is.</p>

<h3>Who am I.</h3>
<p>My name is Gabrielle Morbitzer. I am a recent college graduate from The Ohio State University where I graduated cum laude with a dual degree in International Studies and Spanish. After finishing college, I knew for certain that I had certain passions, but I had no idea how I would combine these seemingly different concepts together to create a cohesive vision and course of action for my future. I delayed applying for graduate school and dedicated myself to finding a way to connect the dots. </p>
<p>I have known for some time now, that yoga teacher training ambiguously fit somewhere into the life I had a lways dreamed for myself. For many, many months after practice, I would sit in a forward fold with my eyes closed and think, someday I will do my training. Usually, this is when thoughts would creep into my consciousness. Thoughts of inadequacy, mostly. I would think about how I need a few more difficult poses before considering this seriously. I would think about how I needed to be able to do standing splits without wanting to scream my head off. I would think about how I need to get to a point where trying to kick up into a handstand wasn't the worst feeling in the world. </p>
<p>However, I recently spent a weekend in New York where I had the opportunity to practice with some truly powerful souls who wiped all of my own insecurities off the board, and turned them into laughter mostly. The thought of studying and journeying within this community has been such a motivating force for me to fund my teacher training in any way possible. I also knew that New York was where I absolutely had to be in order to experience my training. I wanted to be exposed to all that New York has to offer, to be a sponge to the diversity of knowledge that certainly exists within this community.</p>
<p>The studio that caused this fundamental shift of my perspective is called Strala Yoga and they offer a teacher training program in March and April. My goal is to be there. </p>
<p>At Strala Yoga, I experienced an authentic expression of self, perhaps more powerful than anything that I have ever shared with the universe. And so I believe within my core that I cannot ignore what my inner spirit is gravitating toward.</p>
<h3>What I am asking for.</h3>
<p>I decided on crowd sourcing for a few reasons. Primarily, I believe so deeply in the power of community. All of my most powerful experiences in life have come from community building and I feel as though this initiative will only fortify that. I have had a number of people ask me how they can help me reach my goals, and so making the opportunity available will be mutually beneficial. I can imagine that it would be unique and special for my friends and family to understand that they have been directly responsible in my success in following through with what my heart is set on. </p>
<p>I currently have a goal to raise 1,500 dollars and I have given myself one month to meet this goal. This amount will cover the deposit and will give me time to continue to build savings in order to pay the remainder by March. I set this goal because I believe that it is very much attainable. Any contribution will help me get where I need to be. </p>
<p>Yoga is my future. But it is not mine alone. By contributing to my cause, you will also be contributing to exposing people all over the world to this practice. I truly feel as though my practice will go global in the future and I want you to be a part of making that happen. I cannot say for sure how this will manifest exactly, but think empowerment, strength, awareness and appreciation of self. Think of how these emotions can cross borders, can overcome language barriers, should be accessible to all human beings. And think of how it would feel to be a contributor to this. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What else you can do.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>If you cannot financially contribute, or want to know how you can help me otherwise, consider how far support can go. Sharing my campaign with others. And even if they are not able to contribute either, perhaps they will understand the essence of why I am so passionate about this cause. That holds a whole lot of power for me in itself. </p>
<p>Additionally, you can ask me to lead a practice or meditation for you or for a group. I have some experience of doing this and would actually appreciate more practice and growth as I work on developing my own personal practice. I would be happy to do this and I will never ask for anything in return. This will help me more than you know.</p>
<p>Please consider how a small community of us can make a large scale difference. For me, it is not necessarily about a bottom line dollar amount and I believe that is what will ultimately make this project successful. However, the reality of the matter is that I do need financial help to get there. And I'm not afraid of that. </p>

play new instruments, explore technology used to create music, make instruments and so
much more.

I'm passionate about storytelling and creating amazing experiences for kids disguised as author/illustrator Bear James. I'm currently working on two children's books and organizing a kid's festival... and, uh.. making spin-art machines!
Why Oversized Spin art machines? 
We have several festivals coming up, and this project will allow kids to quickly create a gigantic, immersive, and meaningful piece of art to hang in their home. The finished work is up to 3 feet! I can tell you firsthand the satisfaction kids have making and completing a project of this size in minutes, and hanging it in their home.  
What is Spin Art? 
Glad you asked. Check out this Wikipedia Article. Also, here's a cool video (go to the 2 minute mark) and an example of some Spin-Art by artist Damien Hirst that sold at auction for roughly 6 million dollars!
This project is cool because there's also an Art + Tech + Science angle. Having a tactile activity is proven to be an effective learning technique. During the making of the art we'll discuss the science of centrifugal force, the Big Bang theory, and the mechanics of the spinning engine. Trying to predict how the color will mix is also an interesting topic.
These machines will also help contribute to fundraising at elementary and middle schools so help me get this thing funded!   

What We Need & What You Get
What we need:

$500 is the minimum for two oversized spin-art structures, including box materials, the electrical work, the engines, clips, etc. 
$300 for an initial round of paint, paper, canvases, and containers. 
Any extra goes towards drying racks, wheel castors, step stools and other small items like clips, tape, etc that will further enhance the experience. We'll always be able to buy more paint, canvas, and paper. Someone just mentioned using a black light and fluorescent paint. Fun!  
What you get:
 Photos of the process and results will be on the Bear James website 
If for some reason we don't reach our goal, the funds will offset the costs of one of the boxes that's currently being built.      The Impact Art is facing endless challenges in our public schools.There's a need to create opportunities that help strengthen our children's artistic, creative, and critical thinking skills that spans all subjects and disciplines.  Risks & Challenges  Making the spin-art machines is simple in theory but requires woodworking and electrical skills, testing, refining, and craftsmanship to actually make it go well. We're building two machines to have a backup so there's no immediate disappointment at an event with breakage, and to share with other festivals.    Other Ways You Can Help Get the word out.

<p>
</p><p>We started with a very ambitious goal; Bring the job search for coaches out of the stone age and into the electronic age. We thought word of mouth and a 3x5 card posted on a high school bulletin board or on a district website was not a sufficient way to hire a schools next coach and role model to our student athletes. We thought the job responsibilities deserved more, we thought you deserved more so we started iCoachConnect.com. Our next goal is to provide
coaches with the most current training tools, videos, live clinics, interviews, certification
opportunities, and personal branding webinars. All the tools needed to win at your present position, add credentials to your resume and keep being a positive role model. </p>
<p><b>We Win as a Team.</b></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Our research tells us there are approximately 6-7 million coaches in the United States and more entering the profession every year. There are more coaches than jobs so it's becoming harder and harder to land a coaching job. We have made the process much easier for you by creating iCoachConnect. We also believe proving the latest training techniques is the next important service we want to provide you to help you win now or help you secure a new coaching position. </span></p><p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></span></p><p>Here are some of the benefits and services we want to add to iCoachConnect,</p>
<p>· <b>Provide On-line live interactive clinics:</b> so you don’t have to pay hundreds of $$ to advance your personal off season training </p>
<p>· <b>Teach You Personal Branding</b>: To really get those head coaching jobs schools now want to see your Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. They want to see if you have a personal blog with original ideas and evidence of having an online following. It’s really easy and we have lined up some of the best in the business to show you how.</p>
<p>· <b>Coaching Certification training</b> that leads to more opportunities and higher pay</p><p></p><p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>However, to become the Premiere Site for Jobs and Coaches Training Tools well, we can't do it alone.
We need your help. We need to win as a team. We need to raise the necessary funds to hire programmers,
more researchers, a social media professional and an advertising sales
person. We don't believe
coaches should have to pay for essential training to coach our kids.</span><br/></p>
<p>We are connected with
lots of coaches on LinkedIn and Twitter and I have read all your profiles and I
tell you honestly, We're just like you. I want to say thanks to all the coaches
and schools who have tweeted and emailed me thanking us for finding them jobs
and helping them hire coaches.</p>
<p>I’m particularly proud
of the email I received from Lisa Johnson from Monticello High School, MN who
thanked us for helping them find a head swimming coach. If they didn’t find one
soon, the sport would be dropped.</p>
<p>Your emails inspire us
to do more. And we can with your help. Our mission has always been to create a
nationwide<b>“Fraternity of Coaches”</b> where coaches not only find
jobs but also training videos, interviews, clinics, and certifications at no charge. </p>
<p><b style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'><strong>The role you play in our student-athletes lives are just to important.</strong></b><br/></p><p>We Want Coaches to
Focus on Coaching and Teaching Kid’s Right from Wrong. Not pay for the training

<p>I'm passionate about the role coaches play in the lives of our student athletes. Thousands of kids might have taken a different road in their lives if not for the guidance and support provided by their coach.</p>
<p>I was one of them.</p>
<p>I was coming off a great junior year and the expectations for a great senior<br/>season was sky high. I even had thoughts of playing basketball in college but<br/>everything came to a screeching halt. I had lost touch with my dad for the<br/>first time in my life, as he practically fell off the face of the earth.<br/>Instead of talking to him on the phone every night to see how my practice went<br/>and how life is going, I hadn’t heard from him in weeks. </p>
<p>I was about to quit playing until my coach, Coach Heinz sat me down before<br/>practice one day. He could sense something was wrong. I explained to him how my<br/>dad’s abrupt disappearance had been occupying my thoughts all season, which<br/>made basketball nothing more than an afterthought. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry to hear about your dad,” Coach explained, who didn’t quite know what to<br/>say yet. “Maybe you could use basketball as an outlet to forget about what’s<br/>going on in your life.”</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/841602/files/20140907233225-youth-16.jpg?1410157945"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It was sound advice, however, he continued on with a suggestion that would alter<br/>how I lived the rest of my life. “It would make your dad proud as hell if you<br/>kept playing basketball and turned this season around,” Coach Heinz said.<br/>“Maybe you keep your dad in mind for the rest of the year and play for him.”</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/841609/files/20140907233902-Coaches_3.jpg?1410158342"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Coach Heinz was there for me. He was more than my coach. He was my mentor, my role model. He taught me lessons that go far beyond the basketball court. He taught me that what goes on off the court is just as important as what goes on, on the court. Coach Heinz did not just teach the skills, technique and strategy within<br/>the narrow confines of basketball. No, instead he looked for opportunities<br/>where the more important life lessons can be taught such as mastering hardship,<br/>handling and rebounding from failures and setbacks, trusting your teammates,<br/>sacrificing individual needs for the benefit of the team, emotionally dealing<br/>with winning and losing, good sportsmanship, fair play, honesty, and integrity.</p>
<p>What coach taught me stayed with me and it got me thinking of how many other kids were influenced by their coaches, and how many more kids could benefit from a good coach. </p>

iCoachConnect 

We started with a very ambitious goal; Bring the job search for coaches out of the stone age and into the electronic age. We thought word of mouth and a 3x5 card posted on a high school bulletin board or on a district website was not a sufficient way to hire a schools next coach and role model to our student athletes. We thought the job responsibilities deserved more, we thought you deserved more so we started iCoachConnect.com. Our next goal is to provide
coaches with the most current training tools, videos, live clinics, interviews, certification
opportunities, and personal branding webinars. All the tools needed to win at your present position, add credentials to your resume and keep being a positive role model. 
We Win as a Team.
Our research tells us there are approximately 6-7 million coaches in the United States and more entering the profession every year. There are more coaches than jobs so it's becoming harder and harder to land a coaching job. We have made the process much easier for you by creating iCoachConnect. We also believe proving the latest training techniques is the next important service we want to provide you to help you win now or help you secure a new coaching position. Here are some of the benefits and services we want to add to iCoachConnect,
· Provide On-line live interactive clinics: so you don’t have to pay hundreds of $$ to advance your personal off season training 
· Teach You Personal Branding: To really get those head coaching jobs schools now want to see your Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. They want to see if you have a personal blog with original ideas and evidence of having an online following. It’s really easy and we have lined up some of the best in the business to show you how.
· Coaching Certification training that leads to more opportunities and higher payHowever, to become the Premiere Site for Jobs and Coaches Training Tools well, we can't do it alone.
We need your help. We need to win as a team. We need to raise the necessary funds to hire programmers,
more researchers, a social media professional and an advertising sales
person. We don't believe
coaches should have to pay for essential training to coach our kids.
We are connected with
lots of coaches on LinkedIn and Twitter and I have read all your profiles and I
tell you honestly, We're just like you. I want to say thanks to all the coaches
and schools who have tweeted and emailed me thanking us for finding them jobs
and helping them hire coaches.
I’m particularly proud
of the email I received from Lisa Johnson from Monticello High School, MN who
thanked us for helping them find a head swimming coach. If they didn’t find one
soon, the sport would be dropped.
Your emails inspire us
to do more. And we can with your help. Our mission has always been to create a
nationwide“Fraternity of Coaches” where coaches not only find
jobs but also training videos, interviews, clinics, and certifications at no charge. 
The role you play in our student-athletes lives are just to important.We Want Coaches to
Focus on Coaching and Teaching Kid’s Right from Wrong. Not pay for the training
tools to be better coaches. Your
donations add more services and benefits for all the coaches who make a huge
difference daily with our student-athletes.

<p>Gathered in our customary circle on the floor of our rehearsal space, I
asked the cast of 11-14 year old actors a simple question: “Is <i>Macbeth</i> appropriate for you?”  I had allotted ten minutes of
discussion in that night’s rehearsal schedule— I would review the email that I
had sent their parents the night before (in which I relayed the plot of the gruesome
tragedy and assured parents that we would handle the
material sensitively and with respect for children’s unique needs), and we
would quickly, as a group, discuss the merits and challenges of working through
such controversial material.  That
discussion lasted nearly two hours. 
</p>
<p>As I expected, students
agreed—unanimously and immediately—that they could tackle <i>Macbeth</i>.  Hands flew in the air
as our conversation jumped from their familiarity with political violence to
experiences with familial pressure and bullies at school.  The young actors observed that, like
Macbeth as king, bullies are often insecure about their position on the social
ladder.  They brought up the frequency
of addiction and mental illness among celebrities as we talked about the
pressures and perils of fame. “Macbeth can never be happy with what he has,”
one student observed, “and so his ambition becomes like an addiction.”  We delved into gender roles, comparing
the pressure boys often feel to be less sensitive and emotional as they enter
adolescence to Lady Macbeth’s demand that Macbeth prove his masculinity by
killing King Duncan.  When I
brought our conversation to a close, the students groaned. After nearly two
hours of focused, energetic, and entirely student-driven text analysis, these
11-14 year olds still had more to say. 
As I left our circle to prepare for snack time, I listened to the
students’ giddy debriefings.  “That
was amazing!” I heard, “I feel so grown up talking like that about
Shakespeare!”   </p>

If you believe in theater as an exercise in empathy and you believe in the power of the arts to transform young lives, please do what you can to help keep OCSP financially accessible to all who find us.

Development Program (YDP) is an independent volunteer-based youth center, which
brings positive impacts to Cambodian society by creating charity events and
sharing information regarding to scholarship and job opportunities on our
official Facebook page. We are currently holding one project called “My Book, My Future!”, which we
have to build <b>4m x 4m square meters</b> library which <b>costs $2,500</b>  for O Chrey’s students living in O Chrey
village, Barang Tlak commune, Phnom Prek district, Battambang province. Our
objective toward this project is to give them their own library and enhance
their reading skills as it is important for them in the future, and so do
society as a whole. </p>
<p>We
do this campaign in order to raise more funds for our project since we lack of
financial resource to pursue our mission. This campaign is really precious to
us, YDP, to reach our mission and vision and to help those poor children who
desperately need new library and books. Without your help, our YDP team may not
be able to provide a complete library for those students, and we may not do any
changes to our society as a whole. Studying is the right path to get rid of
illiteracy, and it is worth to those who want to grab this opportunities;
therefore, if we do not help them – who? And if we do not start from now –
when? Your contribution and donation is really meaningful to us to give hope to
those rural students. </p>
<p>To
say the truth, we solely <b>need $1,000 </b>more to build a suitable library
for O Chrey’s students in Battambang province, Cambodia. At the very first
time, YDP had much sympathy to those children after visiting them and known
their ambitious to learn, yet they do not have enough material and study areas.
Therefore, we conducted Shine of Hope charity concert last year on the purpose
of giving hope to them to learn. Admittedly, we got <b>$1,500 </b>fromour
charity concertwe organized; unfortunately, it is not enough to help
those children. Hence, I want you to help us to with your kind donation and
contribution to our project because without your help we are hard to reach this
mission. However, if we cannot reach this entire goal or we cannot get fund
from you, we still do not give it up; we determine to pursue this project for a
while and try our best to seek for more funds in any means.</p>
<p>This
project is really extremely crucial and valuable to us, YDP, O Chrey’s
students, the Cambodian society and the world as a whole. Without our help,
those children surely do not have opportunities to learn or even how to read
and write; this makes them blind of knowledge – knowing nothing and becoming
poorer and poorer. Cambodia, which is a developing country, will lose many
potential generations to build up society in the future. More importantly, the
art of helping, sharing and giving hope to each other will make this world
become shrinking world that people can turn to each other. Hence, if you help
us by funding, we will use them for good way – building the library for those
rural children and and providing them various kinds of books. </p><p>Here is the link to our video: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3aWmqhHMnk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3aWmqhHMnk</a></p>

</p>
<p>Greetings Friends!</p>
<p>Nassolo, Nina and Took became dear friends to me when I
lived and worked in Uganda as a Peace Corps Volunteer from September 2006
through November 2008. In 2009 I learned that their mother, Mama Nina, was
sick with AIDS. She was no longer able to keep her daughters in school due to
her illness and insufficient income. I am reaching out to you to ask for a
contribution of any size toward the education of Nassolo and Nina. </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The goal of this
fundraising campaign is to raise $2,700 to pay for the last year of high school
for Nina (the campaign video says two years, however one year has been paid for since making the video) and to contribute towards Nassolo’s second to last year of university.
Nassolo is committed to working part-time to help pay for her education. If we
are able to raise a total of $5,500, the extra funds will be used to pay for
Nassolo’s last year of university and contribute towards Nina’s first year of
university. Thanks to the generous contributions of my friends and family, Took
graduated from high school last year with teaching credentials, Nina completed
her second year of high school, and Nassolo started University. Your
contributions to this campaign will help these motivated young women complete
their educations. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>All<b> </b>donations made to this campaign are tax-deductible through my partnership with the non-profit With God's Little Ones. Additionally, in appreciation for your contribution to Nassolo and Nina’s educations, I am
pleased to offer you a gift with a touch of East African flavor. People who
contribute at all levels will receive twice-yearly updates from Nassolo and
Nina about how they are doing in school.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>By
contributing to this campaign you make an investment not just in these young
ladies lives but also in their family and community. Your contribution will
ripple out as it empowers these young women to find meaningful work that pays
a living wage, allows them to support their mother’s health care and living
costs and reinvest their earnings back into their community.  </p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, in sub-Saharan
Africa fewer than one in five girls make it to secondary school.  Girls who are able to go to secondary
school are more likely to earn a higher income and invest in their community
and family. An extra year of secondary school adds 15-25% to a woman’s
eventual income.  The World Food
Program found that women who earn an income invest approximately 90% of their
earnings back into their community through their purchases. Education
strengthens women’s ability to meet the basic needs of thier families while
boosting thier health, sense of self-worth and independence.</p>
<p>In Uganda public education is not an option past primary
school. The limited primary public schools don’t have room for all the
students, and they still ask families to pay a fee for attendance, uniforms and
supplies, which is prohibitive to many families. Public primary school teachers
are frequently not paid or underpaid and are frequently themselves
undereducated. By secondary school there are no public education options.</p>
<p>The HIV/AIDS epidemic has heavily impacted many families,
leaving parents unable to work and children orphaned. Other families don’t have
the benefit of education themselves so their work options are mostly limited to
subsistence farming, which does not provide them with income sufficient to send
their children to school.</p>
<p>Your investment in the education of Nassolo and Nina will
help these young ladies access competitive jobs that pay a living wage and
support the long-term well-being of their families. </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Ugandan students take rigorous qualifying exams to pass from one grade level to the next. Some students don't pass these exams and are held back a year. There is a potential risk that Nassolo or Nina won't pass her exams and will be held back a year. Thankfully, Nassolo and Nina have done well in their studies to date. 
They have passed all of their exams with good marks. Their dedication to
 their studies will help them avoid being held back in school. </p>
<p>Another potential risk is illness or family emergencies. It is common that students in Uganda are not able to complete school without interruption due to personal illness or family emergencies. However, Nassolo and Nina are part of a strong community that supports their family's well-being. In times when Mama Nina has been sick her extended family and friends have done what they can to take care of her. The same goes for her daughters. Nassolo and Nina have the best support possible from their community to stay in school when hardships arrive. <br/></p>

There is a potential risk that Nassolo or Nina won't pass her exams and will be held back a year. Thankfully, Nassolo and Nina have done well in their studies to date. 
They have passed all of their exams with good marks. Their dedication to
 their studies will help them avoid being held back in school. 
Another potential risk is illness or family emergencies. It is common that students in Uganda are not able to complete school without interruption due to personal illness or family emergencies. However, Nassolo and Nina are part of a strong community that supports their family's well-being. In times when Mama Nina has been sick her extended family and friends have done what they can to take care of her. The same goes for her daughters. Nassolo and Nina have the best support possible from their community to stay in school when hardships arrive.

<p><b>Yasini “Yacn” Biggo of Tanzania is currently studying law at The University of Dar Es Salaam.</b> In his fourth semester at the university, a forward and innovative thinker, Yacn is studying in hopes of becoming a successful lawyer who can help the woman and children of Tanzania, and of his village who are isolated in society. His time at the university has been funded by generous crowdfunding that has allowed him to continue his education without taking loans from his already impoverished village.</p>
<p>Yacn’s original goal was to provide for his family. He is the only son of five children and feels responsible for providing for his mother and four sisters. His parents rely on unreliable small business ventures, and Yacn wanted to give them a comfortable life. It was after he left his village in Tanzania, when he realized that he could also help his community.<b> It started with his family, but now he aspires to help the women and children of Tanzania who are neglected. He hopes to help those who are denied their rights of owning property, inheritance, work and live in liberty but instead live in extreme poverty.</b></p>
<p><b>Our mission is to help fund his education.</b> With the drive and ambition he has shown thus far, he will achieve amazing things in his community. The first step for Yacn is to finish his degree, so he can then turn his focus towards helping others. Every year has been a struggle to fund his education and other expenses. We hope to provide enough that the financial burden is lifted so he can better focus on his studies. Tuition, fees, books, and a laptop—we hope to cover as much as we can. We would hate to see Yacn’s potential wasted because of the costly price of an invaluable education. </p>
<p><b>We believe in his ability to effect and promote progress within his community.</b> If it were not for the donations received through Aura’s House and other generous individuals, he would not have completed the first four semesters. He has come so far, and with your help we can assure he finishes what we all started together. With your donations we can help a great mind finish the first step in making a difference in the world. </p>
<p><b>What we need and what you get:</b></p>
</div><div> <ul> <li>We aim to raise a total of $1,500 to fund the following elements of Yacn’s education: tuition, fees, books, and a laptop.   The first three will cover Yacn's 5th semester of law school, and the last will help him with his studies - what student today can survive without a computer?!</li> <li>In return for your contribution, you will have the most amazing feeling of having helped not just Yacn, but also every one of the people he intends to assist in his future efforts as a lawyer.  (Ahhh, feel that lovely karma!)  And if that weren't enough, Yacn will send out personal thank you notes via email!  In addition, depending on your donation, further perks include a <a href=""http://aurashouse.com/2015/04/enter-our-11th-birthday-raffle-and-help-fund-bright-young-minds/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">raffle</a>, recipes for Yacn's favorite food and paintings by AUR Fine Arts students - check out our perks section for how to get these very special gifts.  </li> <li>If we don't make our entire goal, all funds raised will still be wired to Yacn's university for his tuition.  We'll post the receipts here once we get them.</li>

</div><div> <p><b>Your contribution will have tremendous impact!</b></p> <ul> <li>For one, Yacn is working all the harder at University, because he knows he's got so many people rooting for his success.  Just the fact that we're all trying has given him all the more renewed energy and determination to succeed as a lawyer. </li>

We wanted an event that was a celebration of our culturally and religiously diverse community. A celebration of the human race! We formed the group, Newcastle: Unity in Diversity, and have teamed up with Refugee Action Network Newcastle to plan this festival as part of National Refugee Week. <br/></p>
<p>Our group came together in response to the racism and bigotry of the Reclaim Australia movement. We felt we couldn't stand by and do nothing in the face of the lies and myths being spread about Muslim people. We believe in the old saying that 'for evil to prevail, all it takes is for good men (and women) to do nothing'. So we are doing something!<br/></p>
<p>The festival starts at the Newcastle Museum at 11am on Saturday 13 June 2015.  We then walk to Civic Park, Newcastle where we start with an Awabakal smoking ceremony and Welcome to Country.  Following this there will be speakers from the Christian (Fr Rod Bower from the Gosford Anglican Church), Muslim, and Jewish congregations.  We have food stalls, bands and dancers. Face painting, hair braiding and much more! It will be a family day so bring your picnic rugs and settle in for an afternoon of multicultural entertainment. <br/></p>
<p>We feel this festival is incredibly important. It creates the opportunity for all those people who want to contribute to making our world a better place, to stand together. The festival will be a celebration but it is also a 'push back' against the racism, hate and bigotry. <br/></p>

Support Buket in her Acting MFA at The Actors Studio Drama School in New York!


Hello! I'm Buket.




I have been chasing my dream despite of all the things I have been through in life and I recently received acceptance from The Actors Studio Drama School for a MFA in Acting. Finally, I am moving one step closer to my dream!

It was my goal to receive a decent education and I have prepared for auditions by myself. I read lots of plays and chose one monologue from among them. I shot a one-minute video which I submitted to apply to The Actors Studio Drama School. It is an inexpressible feeling for me to be accepted to this unique school as the only Turkish student this year, which has many notable alumni like Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, Al Pacino, and Bradley Cooper. Also, I have been offered the President's Graduate Scholarship which is equal to one fourth of the tuition. However, I am not able to cover the rest of the expenses. 

Unfortunately, it is difficult to find support for art and arts education in Turkey. Everybody I consult about scholarships says it is better not to lay hopes on Turkey in this regard. First, I thought this was just a case of prejudice and I applied to every foundation and company that offers scholarships for graduate education. But in the end I have learned is that though there are several scholarships in existence, these are allocated to students who will have “convenient vocations” after their education. In other words, if I were to get a diploma to work in a company after my graduate study, I could find a scholarship. Still, there are some foundations which claim that they offer a scholarship for education in the arts but most of them exclude acting or they decline my application because I am not graduated from a conservatory. Since this is the case, I decided to take action by using my personal experience to draw attention to this issue. I am trying to make this problem visible both for myself and other students who will receive an arts education abroad. My goal is to convince some foundations or institutions to offer an ongoing arts scholarship. The reason this scholarship is necessary for education in the arts abroad, specifically, is that work permits for foreign students, especially in The United States are not possible.

I do not want to give up hope when I am this close to my dream. If you help me to share the word through my campaign, I believe this will show that there are people who are sensitive to this issue. Thank you in advance.


Educational Background 
I am a graduate from a well known high school, Bornova Anatolian High School, in Izmir. I started to study Mathematics in Bogazici University in 2009. My dream has always been my dream, but I have always aimed to be a well-educated actress who can feed her artistic endeavours through various subject matters. I realized my interest in philosophy and began to study Philosophy at Bogazici University in 2012. I have completed my major in three years and in June I will graduate with high honors.

Women in Council - Bogazici University Players, Istanbul (2010)
Pinocchio - Studententheater De Koffer, Tilburg University, Holland (2013):
Through this project, I had the opportunity to work in an international theatre play. Rudolf van Bree, Dutch theatre director, adapted the well-known story of Pinocchio as a musical theatre play and it was performed in the theatre building De NWE Vorst in the city center.

We are excited to use our newly acquired knowledge in the field of bioinformatics for a hands-on project with the guidance of our well-experienced advisors. You can meet our advisors and rest of us here.Wish us luck! Other Ways You Can Help If you are unable to donate to our project, please help us out to spread the message around!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Thank you for stopping by! I'll be embarking on my second study abroad journey in just 3 short weeks to Växjö, Sweden. There, I will be studying design at Linnæus University. Of course I am WAY excited, and I have been working hard to get to this point! While working 3 jobs and going to school full time, I have been saving my pennies for this huge adventure ( after all, Sweden is a pretty dang expensive place ).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> I've had a few family members / friends from out of town ask if I had a fundraiser page for this trip ( like I did my last ), so this a a place where they can support me if they choose!</p>

<h3>OUR PERKS</h3>
<p>​In addition to guitar pics, stickers, teeshirts, and hoodies, we have a special perk for the David Bowie fans out there. Scout Bookham is a 9-year old guitarist who has been taking lessons at MCMA for 4 years. Her idol is David Bowie, and when he passed away, Scout decided to raise $1,500 in his honor for a memorial scholarship. Scout has a number of Bowie inspired posters that she has designed this fall, and in exchange for a $50 donation to her scholarship fund, she will send you a signed poster. For those of you in the area, come to our winter student recital on January 29th at the Strand Theater to hear Scout play ""Space Oddity"" and announce the results of her fundraising effort. </p>

To learn more about the 2016 journeys click here. The applicant's project is described below. The What 
What is the purpose of school in the 21st century?

Teachers and students lack a proper platform to dissect this essential question within their communities, as well as online. The Millennial Teacher in Motion (that's me!) will kickstart these conversations in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, Milwaukee and Detroit. My project will examine the dynamic lives of Millennial teachers and their students through in-person interviews which ask them a variety of questions, namely: 
- What initially attracted you to the teaching profession? 
 
- What is making you stay in the classroom?And the most essential question:  
- What do you believe is the purpose of school in the 21st century?
There is a sense of urgency to my project because if the United States wants to recruit the best and brightest minds to enter and stay in the classroom, I believe it must reimagine how it incentivizes future would-be career teachers to join the field of education and how it equips students with the 21st century skills needed to succeed in a globalized idea economy.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, let's back up a bit and start at the beginning. My journey to the classroom is a bit of an alternative one. After realizing I enjoyed volunteering to teach English to adult immigrants in the District way more than working at my salaried day job, I hightailed it down to South America where I fell in love with the beauty and spirit of Colombia. While there, I worked in support of the National Ministry of Education's bilingualism initiative. Upon my return to the States, I applied to an alternative teacher certification program which placed me in the high school I now work. I teach high school English and am grateful for the fact that no day in the classroom is ever the same. Ever.

</div></div>","Wilderness Inquiry’s Canoemobile is on a mission to change lives of youth – one paddle at a time.
On September
15, we’re rolling into Michigan City, IN as a stop on our
national Canoemobile tour. In five days, we plan to take over 500 local kids on
paddling and outdoor educational adventures, and we need
just $5,000 to make it happen. 
Your support
will… 
   • Provide opportunities for youth to experience their local waterway.
   • Connect participants
to the outdoors.
   • Inspire a passion for
outdoor recreation.
   • Combat issues
such as Nature Deficit Disorder, obesity, & the achievement gap.
   • Offer a MEMORABLE experience! 




We are fortunate to work with many generous partners and donors, but we need your help to reach our final goal and make the Michigan City Canoemobile a success! We seek to raise $5,000 to support Canoemobile programming in Michigan City. This money will go towards costs associated with travel, staff, lodging, equipment, permits, and ULTIMATELY, will support Michigan City youth to participate in this valuable experience.



We are creating the next generation of environmental stewards. As more youth grow up in urban areas, their
opportunities for outdoor experiences are dwindling. We need to reverse
the trend of today’s youth being disconnected from the natural world. 
Studies have
shown that direct experiences in the outdoors have the potential to increase
community engagement, develop personal skills, increase health, and boost academic achievement. 






With the Canoemobile comes one van, a trailer holding six 24' Voyageur canoes, all gear and equipment, and a crew of dedicated outdoor educators. We are traveling across America bringing dynamic outdoor learning experiences to communities, challenging the notion that outdoor adventure can only happen outside our modern cities. The outdoors is all around us! 





On September 14, the Canoemobile will travel 471 miles from Minneapolis, MN to Michigan City, IN for five days of outdoor adventures on Trail Creek, a tributary of Lake Michigan. In those five days, we will: 
   • Discuss the importance of preserving local waterways.
   • Expose over 500 people to the wilderness of Trail Creek and Lake Michigan.
   • Teach basic paddling and water safety skills.
   • Discuss native and invasive species.
   • Initiate team-building.
   • Canoe, of course!
We have teamed up with local partners to take youth outside for applied learning experiences throughout the week. Not only will youth learn something new, but they will challenge themselves, step out of their comfort zones, and have a blast while doing it! Our trip to Michigan City culminates with a day of paddling open to all members of the community. 






Share our fundraising effort with your friends
     on social media, through word of mouth, rally a
     community group, or any way you can spread the word.

<p>50% of the school age going children in Tudor can’t get education because most of their families are poor and are unable to pay since the schools around are too expensive and the other affordable schools are distance away especially for the nursery pupils.

<p>Tudor is one of the slum settlements that existed in Mombasa, Kenya. There are around 2,000 households and residents’ main occupation is house help of high-end residential next to the slum area. Large part of the residents lives below one dollar a day. </p>

 Education will benefit from hip-hop music in the following ways: Hip-hop culture is engaging through music and the elements. Hip-hop teaches a variety of subject matter through its music. Hip-hop is currently utilized in both educational and even therapeutic settings. Hip-hop is a versatile form of creative expression. We have personally witnessed the power of hip-hop in educational settings. Hip-hop teaches people about life, is a motivator to learn, and is an advocate of seeking knowledge.

  Risks & Challenges At this stage of the game, there really aren't any risks. We are so close to our budget goal that we just need a little help to get the project started. If we can surpass our goal and raise an extra $7600, we can take the project from great to INCREDIBLE.

  Other Ways You Can Help Any dollar amount will help us reach our goal. You can also help by sharing this campaign with others. Post about it on Facebook, tweet to your followers, share with your favorite charitable organization. Then, come play with us when the construction is complete!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>The Avalon Academy (<a href=""http://www.theavalonacademy.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.theavalonacademy.org</a>)
is a special school for children and young adults who are severely physically
disabled. Most of our students depend on wheelchairs because they have a
condition called cerebral palsy, a form of brain damage which impairs movement
and posture.</p>
<p>Currently our students rely on public transportation for community
outings. Public buses are time-consuming and inefficient as they can only
accommodate two people in wheelchairs at one time. They are also unreliable so
trips need to be cancelled if the weather is unfavorable. We have to rely on
parent volunteers for trips with more than two students or if destinations
aren’t convenient for public transportation.</p>
<p>The students love being out in the community. Typical
activities include:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Educational visits to local museums</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Volunteering at the local SPCA</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Running errands to stores, farmers market, and
the post office</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Social events at local coffee shops</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Swimming </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Seasonal trips eg pumpkin patch, ice-skating</p>
<p>Avalon has struggled with issues surrounding public
transportation for students for the last ten years. Our students need a better
solution. They should have access to the greater community just like all school aged students. Please help us expand the horizons and brighten up the lives of these
very deserving young people.</p>
<p><b>What We Need </b></p>
<p>$60,000 would buy a 2015 RAM ProMaster 2500 with a high
roof, long wheelbase, and Mobility Package. The Mobility Package includes a
side or rear ADA lift plus SmartFloor technology which provides moveable
seating and layouts that can be readily changed to accommodate different numbers
of wheelchairs. </p>
<p><b>What An Adapted Van Will Allow Us To Do </b></p>
<p>All of our students depend on wheelchairs to access their world. A wheelchair-accessible van will allow more students more
access to more places. We will no longer be limited by the constraints of
public transport. An adapted van will enable us to:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Visit places not easily accessible by public
transport</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Visit a variety of far off destinations as
transportation will be less time-consuming</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Go on trips when parents aren’t able to
volunteer</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Travel when the weather isn’t good</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Travel as a school community in a larger group</p>

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>A dedicated van that has been adapted for students in
wheelchairs will open up a wealth of possibilities for a group of young people
for whom access to the community is extremely difficult. Easier access to the
local community also increases the visibility of our students who are coping
with severe challenges, thereby promoting greater acceptance and integration
into society.</p>
<p><b>About Our School</b></p>
<p>The Avalon Academy is an innovative model school for
children and young adults aged 5-22 years with severe physical disabilities
caused by cerebral palsy. We have a <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">unique emphasis on integrating movement education into all
aspects of the school curriculum. The school opened in 2005 and is located in
Burlingame, California and serves students from throughout the Bay Area. We are
accredited by the California Department of Education.</span></p>
<p>Avalon currently serves 16 students. In addition to physical
disabilities, all students also experience other complications associated with
cerebral palsy. Students are non-verbal and rely on specialized devices to
communicate. Many students have feeding difficulties and several must be
tube-fed. All students have some degree of cognitive impairment and about half
experience seizures. Vision impairment is also common.</p>
<p>Avalon prides itself on the quality of education and
services it provides for students with very significant needs.  In addition to 4 highly qualified special
education teachers, we employ physical therapists, speech and language
pathologists, and a teacher for the visually impaired. A team of dedicated
instructional assistants ensure that the student: staff ratio is close to 1:1. Avalon
is a happy, innovative, respectful, and enriching community.</p>
<p><b>About Cerebral Palsy</b></p>
<p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is the term used for a group of non-progressive
disorders of movement and posture caused by abnormal development of, or damage
to, motor control centers of the brain. CP is caused by events that affect the
developing brain before, during, or after birth. Examples of risk factors for
CP include premature birth, asphyxia during birth, and meningitis during early
childhood. </p>
<p>The abnormalities of muscle control that define CP are often accompanied
by other disorders caused by more extensive damage to the developing brain.
These include cognitive impairment, communication disorders, feeding problems,
seizures, and vision impairment.</p>
<p>Approximately 500,000 children and adults in the United States have CP, and
it is newly diagnosed in about 6,000 infants and young children each year.</p>
<p><b>How Cerebral Palsy Affects Our Students’ Lives</b></p>
<p>Avalon specializes in the education and well-being of young people with
the most challenging disabilities caused by CP. Our students are dependent on
family, friends, and caregivers for all aspects of their lives. All of the
students at Avalon need assistance with mobility as they are dependent on
wheelchairs. Some students require assistance while utilizing other
equipment such as walkers. Our students are non-verbal and use specialized programmable devices
to communicate, often via a head-switch if arm control is affected. Eating and
drinking is challenging for our students with some relying on tube-feeding. </p>
<p>Our students are remarkably resilient and remain happy and sociable in
spite of the many challenges that life has thrown at them.</p>
<p><b>Please Share our Story</b></p>
<p>We cannot do this alone, it needs to be a community effort. Please share
our story with your friends and contacts.</p>

trips need to be cancelled if the weather is unfavorable. We have to rely on
parent volunteers for trips with more than two students or if destinations
aren’t convenient for public transportation.
The students love being out in the community. Typical
activities include:
· 
Educational visits to local museums
· 
Volunteering at the local SPCA
· 
Running errands to stores, farmers market, and
the post office
· 
Social events at local coffee shops
· 
Swimming 
· 
Seasonal trips eg pumpkin patch, ice-skating
Avalon has struggled with issues surrounding public
transportation for students for the last ten years. Our students need a better
solution. They should have access to the greater community just like all school aged students. Please help us expand the horizons and brighten up the lives of these
very deserving young people.
What We Need 
$60,000 would buy a 2015 RAM ProMaster 2500 with a high
roof, long wheelbase, and Mobility Package. The Mobility Package includes a
side or rear ADA lift plus SmartFloor technology which provides moveable
seating and layouts that can be readily changed to accommodate different numbers
of wheelchairs. 
What An Adapted Van Will Allow Us To Do 
All of our students depend on wheelchairs to access their world. A wheelchair-accessible van will allow more students more
access to more places. We will no longer be limited by the constraints of
public transport. An adapted van will enable us to:
· 
Visit places not easily accessible by public
transport
· 
Visit a variety of far off destinations as
transportation will be less time-consuming
· 
Go on trips when parents aren’t able to
volunteer
· 
Travel when the weather isn’t good
· 
Travel as a school community in a larger group

The Impact
A dedicated van that has been adapted for students in
wheelchairs will open up a wealth of possibilities for a group of young people
for whom access to the community is extremely difficult. Easier access to the
local community also increases the visibility of our students who are coping
with severe challenges, thereby promoting greater acceptance and integration
into society.
About Our School
The Avalon Academy is an innovative model school for
children and young adults aged 5-22 years with severe physical disabilities
caused by cerebral palsy. We have a unique emphasis on integrating movement education into all
aspects of the school curriculum. The school opened in 2005 and is located in
Burlingame, California and serves students from throughout the Bay Area. We are
accredited by the California Department of Education.
Avalon currently serves 16 students. In addition to physical
disabilities, all students also experience other complications associated with
cerebral palsy. Students are non-verbal and rely on specialized devices to
communicate. Many students have feeding difficulties and several must be
tube-fed. All students have some degree of cognitive impairment and about half
experience seizures. Vision impairment is also common.
Avalon prides itself on the quality of education and
services it provides for students with very significant needs.  In addition to 4 highly qualified special
education teachers, we employ physical therapists, speech and language
pathologists, and a teacher for the visually impaired. A team of dedicated
instructional assistants ensure that the student: staff ratio is close to 1:1. Avalon
is a happy, innovative, respectful, and enriching community.
About Cerebral Palsy
Cerebral palsy (CP) is the term used for a group of non-progressive
disorders of movement and posture caused by abnormal development of, or damage
to, motor control centers of the brain. CP is caused by events that affect the
developing brain before, during, or after birth. Examples of risk factors for
CP include premature birth, asphyxia during birth, and meningitis during early
childhood. 
The abnormalities of muscle control that define CP are often accompanied
by other disorders caused by more extensive damage to the developing brain.
These include cognitive impairment, communication disorders, feeding problems,
seizures, and vision impairment.
Approximately 500,000 children and adults in the United States have CP, and
it is newly diagnosed in about 6,000 infants and young children each year.
How Cerebral Palsy Affects Our Students’ Lives
Avalon specializes in the education and well-being of young people with
the most challenging disabilities caused by CP. Our students are dependent on
family, friends, and caregivers for all aspects of their lives. All of the
students at Avalon need assistance with mobility as they are dependent on
wheelchairs. Some students require assistance while utilizing other
equipment such as walkers. Our students are non-verbal and use specialized programmable devices
to communicate, often via a head-switch if arm control is affected. Eating and
drinking is challenging for our students with some relying on tube-feeding. 
Our students are remarkably resilient and remain happy and sociable in
spite of the many challenges that life has thrown at them.
Please Share our Story
We cannot do this alone, it needs to be a community effort. Please share
our story with your friends and contacts.

After meeting these students it sunk in that they will not have the funds to have any of their pictures printed. How great would it be to give each student a gift card for professional printing along with their CD?

<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">If $500 is raised, each student will get a $100 gift card which will enable them to print several of their favorites for their friends and family.

Several of </span><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">these students work during the school year to help their families. One of the students I met told me her mother has two jobs.

</div></div>","My name is Nova Moisa and I am taking senior portraits for five students chosen by Park Rose High School's Homeless Advocate. I am asking for your help to pay for Pro Photo Supply gift cards enabling each student to print their favorite pictures.

I was shocked and saddened to learn that local high schools have the need for a full-time Homeless Advocate. By the time these kids reach high school the average student has attended eight different schools. I recently met a former student who attended fourteen different schools between kindergarden and 12th grade. 

   What We Need
On Tuesday, November 18th, I took pictures for two of these students. After the pictures have been edited, each student will get a CD of their images. After meeting these students it sunk in that they will not have the funds to have any of their pictures printed. How great would it be to give each student a gift card for professional printing along with their CD? This would allow them to share wallet sizes with their friends and give larger pictures to their relatives. 
If $500 is raised, each student will get a $100 gift card which will enable them to print several of their favorites for their friends and family. Any amount less than $500 will be split equally between the five students.
These are great kids! Several of these students work during the school year to help their families. One of the students I met told me her mother has two jobs. Paying for prints on their own is simply out of their grasp. 
By donating to this cause, you are making an impact on the lives of these five students! You're letting them know that they have supporters who want them to succeed.

    Other Ways You Can Help I realize not everyone can help out financially, here are two other ways you can help:

Youth was created in October, 2008 by a group of volunteers and professionals
with experience working with homeless LGBT youth in various shelter and
transitional housing settings. The mission of the organization is to increase
the self-sufficiency of homeless LGBT youth to enable them to “go beyond” the
shelter system and transition into stable adult lives. We do this by providing
services such as case management, education services, life skills training,
community-building recreational activities, opportunities for self-expression,
and support services for HIV+ youth. Our guiding principles are those of harm
reduction, youth development, and empowerment.</span></p>

Arts in the Woods 2014July 13th to July 18thA SUMMER ARTS CAMP FOR  HOMELESS LGBTQ YOUNG  ADULTS





Nestled in the rolling hills of upstate New York, Arts in The Woods is a summer arts retreat designed to empower young queer artists and build an intergenerational community of visual artists, musicians, dancers, writers and performers. From Sunday July 13th to Friday July 18th, young people ages 18-24 who have survived NYC and Boston's queer youth shelters will attend a collective arts residency at Easton Mountain Retreat Center and be nurtured by more established queer artists and performers. Arts in the Woods creates space for all participants to heal together from the misogyny, transphobia, racism, inadequate housing, and economic injustice so pervasive in our cities. The beautiful land at Easton Mountain offers artistic inspiration and a perfect backdrop for creativity.
Our goal for 2014 is to develop the creativity and leadership of 40 young people and 8 teaching artists at this summer's Arts in the Woods.  WE NEED YOUR HELP to make this incredible experience financially possible.
Workshops were made in art, theater, music, fashion, crafts, and dance movement.  Intergenerational sharing circles provided a safe and loving environment for participants to process their experiences and build community.  Help us create this Arts in the Woods 2014 by making a donation today!




We are pleased to announce the return of Greg Cassin. Greg is a powerful charismatic group leader working with at risk youth. He will be leading the group healing circles and guiding the youth campers with love and care.                           Announcing our esteemed  2014 Senior Mentors!   Mark Allan Davis                    Roberto Juarez                       Julie Tolentino  Dance & Theater                    Painting & Drawing             Performance ArtOur 2014 Artist TeachersWil Fisher          Maia Cruz Palileo     Ethan Shoshan      Darin Chase       Freddy Freeman

Youth was created in October, 2008 by a group of volunteers and professionals
with experience working with homeless LGBT youth in various shelter and
transitional housing settings. The mission of the organization is to increase
the self-sufficiency of homeless LGBT youth to enable them to “go beyond” the
shelter system and transition into stable adult lives. We do this by providing
services such as case management, education services, life skills training,
community-building recreational activities, opportunities for self-expression,
and support services for HIV+ youth. Our guiding principles are those of harm
reduction, youth development, and empowerment.
GLASS Boston:  Boston Gay & Lesbian Adolescent Social Services opened in 1995, as New England’s first (and the country’s fourth) community center serving young people in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community. An average of 25-30 youth a night come to GLASS to meet friends, talk to staff or participate in formal programming.   Boston GLASS provides counseling, advocacy and referrals for health care services and housing to Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Questioning (GLBTQ) teens and young adults, many of whom are youth of color. Sylvia's Place: MCCNY Homeless Youth Services: Sylvia’s Place is the starting
point for New York City’s LGBTQI youth in crisis. Integrating case management
with mental health services while stressing the unique strengths and potential
of each youth, MCCNY Homeless Youth Services has developed a proven method for
serving LGBTQI youth in crisis. This method has been modeled by service
providers across the country and around the world.THE ALI FORNEY CENTER  The Ali Forney Center is the largest and most comprehensive program in the nation dedicated to meeting the needs of homeless LGBTQ youth.

<h3>Our Current Situation<br/>
</h3> <p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>Wilderland has always managed to sustain itself financially through selling honey, produce and crafts at local markets and a modest roadside shop. However, the council has demanded that a retrospective development  fee that Wilderland has been paying off in $50 weekly installments be paid within the month. Wilderland has attempted to negotiate a feasible payment plan but the council no longer wants to communicate. They have threatened a forced sale of the land if the remaining $30000 is not paid by the end of the month. Without your help this irreplaceable learning institute may be lost forever.</div><div>//See update above//<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
</div><p></p><p> Wilderland has
been going through a strong re-visioning process over the last year,
reassessing our intentions and perspectives and ensuring our practices are in
line with the specifics set out in the trust deed. We aim to improve facilities
for the volunteers who come here every day from all over the world. This will
take the form of a new visitor house with integrated facilities for accommodation
and workshops.</p>
<p>We are also always continuing
to develop new ways to decrease our footprint, increase self-sufficiency and
work towards creating a truly sustainable space for the benefit of all and are
keen to share this knowledge with everyone.</p><p>Make a donation now to guarantee Wilderland for future generations. </p><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our greatest challenge
to resolve this threat is the time frame in which we have recently been ordered
to pay the remainder of this fee.<br/>
Wilderland's economic sustainability would be at jeopardy should we need to
enter into a mortgage agreement with a financial institution to cover these
council fees. Even so, our bank has advised that the risk to their public image
is too high should they have to foreclose on a loan to Wilderland, so they are
unwilling to give us a loan.</p>
<p>Donate now to stop the forced sale of this land.</p>
<p>For more information you can watch the short video on our situation or please feel free to ask any questions you may have.</p>
<p>Note - The council is demanding that we pay $30,203.63. We are trying to raise $32,000 in order to be able to pay this and cover costs of the fundraising campaign.</p>

As of today we have had sufficient private donations through our bank accounts to top up our total high enough to clear the debt! We are incredibly grateful to all who have contributed to the campaign and are happy to announce that through the efforts and generosity of our supporters all over the world Wilderland is now safe from the councils demands and can continue to push forward.

This doesn't mean the fundraising has to stop though. As discussed in the updates section we are going to put any excess funds generated during the remainder of the crowd funding campaign towards building our new visitor house. This is the next step in turning Wilderland into a truly world class education center and hive of sustainability. So if you believe in this goal by all means continue to donate and watch Wilderland grow and change the world.




Sustainability in Action. 

Wilderland is a charitable Trust dedicated to empowering individuals to enhance the global environment and personal health of everyone. A unique education centre where sustainable living is a reality, Wilderland offers people just like you the chance to come and learn about living in a way that will preserve the environment for future generations. 

^$






Our Current Situation
 

Wilderland has always managed to sustain itself financially through selling honey, produce and crafts at local markets and a modest roadside shop. However, the council has demanded that a retrospective development  fee that Wilderland has been paying off in $50 weekly installments be paid within the month. Wilderland has attempted to negotiate a feasible payment plan but the council no longer wants to communicate. They have threatened a forced sale of the land if the remaining $30000 is not paid by the end of the month. Without your help this irreplaceable learning institute may be lost forever.//See update above//
Please donate now to ensure a sustainable future
for all!


The Future of Wilderland


 Wilderland has
been going through a strong re-visioning process over the last year,
reassessing our intentions and perspectives and ensuring our practices are in
line with the specifics set out in the trust deed. We aim to improve facilities
for the volunteers who come here every day from all over the world. This will
take the form of a new visitor house with integrated facilities for accommodation
and workshops.
We are also always continuing
to develop new ways to decrease our footprint, increase self-sufficiency and
work towards creating a truly sustainable space for the benefit of all and are
keen to share this knowledge with everyone.Make a donation now to guarantee Wilderland for future generations. 
Risks & Challenges
Our greatest challenge
to resolve this threat is the time frame in which we have recently been ordered
to pay the remainder of this fee.
Wilderland's economic sustainability would be at jeopardy should we need to
enter into a mortgage agreement with a financial institution to cover these
council fees. Even so, our bank has advised that the risk to their public image
is too high should they have to foreclose on a loan to Wilderland, so they are
unwilling to give us a loan.
Donate now to stop the forced sale of this land.
For more information you can watch the short video on our situation or please feel free to ask any questions you may have.
Note - The council is demanding that we pay $30,203.63. We are trying to raise $32,000 in order to be able to pay this and cover costs of the fundraising campaign.

Other Ways You Can Help
Please get the word out to your friends, networks and make some noise about our situation! 

All your help and generosity is greatly appreciated.

</p><p><b>Our Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Who are
we? And why are we asking for your help?</p>
<p>Hello,
my name is Creighton Jones, and I am the founder of Jones Music Media Inc. and
The Young Musicians Foundation, a 501 (c)3 non-profit organization, that seeks
to fund the music education of low-income children. I established this
organization as a way for a myself and other musicians alike, to connect
with each other and give back to the community. We
provide an outlet and resource for children looking to learn music, and gain
potential scholarships for music lessons or schools, and to connect with
musicians in the community as a source of encouragement.</p>
<p>JMM
Inc., was created with the hopes of giving EVERY child the means to learn
music, and not just those who come from families that are financially secure. Our
organization works to give these
children the chance that we didn’t have, as our
members also come from low-income families and couldn’t afford music lessons
outside of school.  This community has given
us so much, and as an organization we seek to give back to that as much as
possible.</p>
<p>We
are a community based organization, that gives back to the community that’s
given us so much. As a nonprofit, our hope for success would not
be possible without you. We
now ask that you help us give back to those that were like us, and didn’t have
a chance, or an opportunity to
expand their education.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>JMM
Inc., with your help, is seeking to raise $10,000. Half of this amount will go
directly into The Young Musicians Foundation to cover
the costs of scholarships and music lessons through the end
of the year. The remainder will
help pay for the facility, utilities, and
office supplies. We are also planning to
purchase musical instruments that children involved in the
after school youth programs we work with, can play with, and learn to use.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>By contributing a few dollars, the cost
of a cup of coffee, you ensure a child’s education. You provide another
engaging outlet for him or her, and help keep them out of the street. No good deed should go unrecognized, and therefore through
your generosity, you are investing in a child’s future to pay it forward to the
same community, that did so for them.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>As
there is always a risk of not raising enough money to support a cause, many
nonprofits fade and are forgotten.
In the end, it comes down to the one who created the organization, how
passionate he or she is about their cause, and to what end they’ll go to seeing
it succeed.</p>
<p>As a
former educator and musician, my passion has always been teaching, and
performing music; giving back to those that truly need help. Music, no matter
the genre, has always been uplifting to the listener, and is the one art that
can bring any different culture, gender, or socioeconomic background together.</p>
<p>While
we understand the risks, we also believe that there will always be interest in
our cause as we keep our focus on children, education, music, and community. We
compensate for this risk, by creating community events and fundraisers. We team with
other non-profits by having fundraisers or collaborative meetings that
share and give advice. We
work with musicians that we’ve promoted and recorded at our studio, and look to
them to give voice or instrumental music lessons.</p>
<p>Our
organization is our passion, our day to day work that we live, breath and have
fun with, and because of that, we will always find a way for it to succeed.</p>

That information is then used by response, rescue and relief workers to deploy their support more effectively – whether it is shelter, food, medicine or evacuation.</p><p>We are also providing response teams with physical and digital maps updated in real time via our <a href=""http://kathmandulivinglabs.github.io/quake-maps/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">QuakeRelief.info</a> platform. They use our maps for navigation, to identify the location of damaged buildings, and even to find landing sites for helicopters.</p><p>The most amazing thing about our maps is that they are created thanks to the power of the crowd. The underlying data we use to create the maps is sourced from thousands of volunteers, both inside and outside of Nepal. Since the day of the earthquake, almost 5,000 volunteers from the <a href=""http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=10/27.7704/85.2910"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OpenStreetMap</a> community have helped us create maps for this crisis. The <a href=""http://hotosm.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)</a> has been coordinating this effort from abroad, and we coordinate from Nepal, directing the volunteers to the areas that are in most need of mapping based on the situation on the ground.</p><p>For example, after the second major earthquake on May 12th, we received an <a href=""http://quakemap.org/reports/view/1868"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">urgent call for medical help</a> from Sunkhani, Dolakha. We immediately sent out alerts to all the rescue and relief operators That very same day, the Nepal Army evacuated the four people who were reported to be wounded in Sunkhani, including a child.</p><p><b>Who we are</b></p><p>Kathmandu Living Labs (KLL) is a non-profit organization working on open mapping and civic technology in Nepal. Over the past few years, our team has developed detailed hazard maps of Kathmandu using the OpenStreetMap platform. In the aftermath of the April earthquake our maps have proved to be crucial in supporting the relief effort. As the government of Nepal and the humanitarian and development organizations present on the field are starting to plan the reconstruction process, our maps will be used to identify and prioritize needs.</p><p>We are partnering with Udhyami Nepali, which is a 501(c)(3) registered non-profit in the United States, in this campaign. <br/></p><p><b>How we will use the funding</b></p><p>The scale of the disaster is seriously straining our capacity. KLL has been working out of <a href=""http://www.biruwa.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.biruwa.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Biruwa Ventures</a>’ coworking space since its inception. The building suffered structural damage due to the first quake and the conditions worsened after the major aftershock on May 12th. Biruwa has generously supported us for the last two years and helped us scale our operations after the earthquake. However, to continue to support the relief efforts and the reconstruction planning, we need to relocate, get more staff on board and purchase additional equipment.</p><p>Our work relies on the power of the crowd – staff and volunteers in Nepal and across the world who come together to create maps that provide a crucially important information in this time of crisis. We believe in the power of the crowd, and that is why we are asking for your help to continue doing our work.

There was already enough medical supplies in Sankhu, and we ended up having to bring the supplies back to Kathmandu.At that moment I realized that to help the survivors it is essential to know what is needed where. And to know that you need reliable information.”This is where the work we do at Kathmandu Living Labs comes in.What we doOur Quakemap.org platform enables people who are in the field to report in real time what and where needs are. That information is then used by response, rescue and relief workers to deploy their support more effectively – whether it is shelter, food, medicine or evacuation.We are also providing response teams with physical and digital maps updated in real time via our QuakeRelief.info platform. They use our maps for navigation, to identify the location of damaged buildings, and even to find landing sites for helicopters.The most amazing thing about our maps is that they are created thanks to the power of the crowd. The underlying data we use to create the maps is sourced from thousands of volunteers, both inside and outside of Nepal. Since the day of the earthquake, almost 5,000 volunteers from the OpenStreetMap community have helped us create maps for this crisis. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) has been coordinating this effort from abroad, and we coordinate from Nepal, directing the volunteers to the areas that are in most need of mapping based on the situation on the ground.For example, after the second major earthquake on May 12th, we received an urgent call for medical help from Sunkhani, Dolakha. We immediately sent out alerts to all the rescue and relief operators That very same day, the Nepal Army evacuated the four people who were reported to be wounded in Sunkhani, including a child.Who we areKathmandu Living Labs (KLL) is a non-profit organization working on open mapping and civic technology in Nepal. Over the past few years, our team has developed detailed hazard maps of Kathmandu using the OpenStreetMap platform. In the aftermath of the April earthquake our maps have proved to be crucial in supporting the relief effort. As the government of Nepal and the humanitarian and development organizations present on the field are starting to plan the reconstruction process, our maps will be used to identify and prioritize needs.We are partnering with Udhyami Nepali, which is a 501(c)(3) registered non-profit in the United States, in this campaign. How we will use the fundingThe scale of the disaster is seriously straining our capacity. KLL has been working out of Biruwa Ventures’ coworking space since its inception. The building suffered structural damage due to the first quake and the conditions worsened after the major aftershock on May 12th. Biruwa has generously supported us for the last two years and helped us scale our operations after the earthquake. However, to continue to support the relief efforts and the reconstruction planning, we need to relocate, get more staff on board and purchase additional equipment.Our work relies on the power of the crowd – staff and volunteers in Nepal and across the world who come together to create maps that provide a crucially important information in this time of crisis. We believe in the power of the crowd, and that is why we are asking for your help to continue doing our work. All of the funding provided will be used to provide better mapping and bridging the information gap in Nepal’s relief and rebuilding.Our work has received coverage in both local and international press, including:·  The New York Times,·  BBC,·  Wired,·  Nepali Times,·  Setopati,·  My Republica,·  Canadian Forces portal",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

They take charge of their experience by choosing their own topics on a broad theme -- this year’s theme is “Rights and Responsibilities.” Then, they  conduct first-hand historical research and produce their projects in a format they choose to match their passions -- documentary, exhibit, essay, performance, or website.  </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""326"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DvxpLSH8NPaw&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=326&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><i>View this student-produced documentary on Loving vs Virginia -- a winner at the 2013 statewide competition!</i></p><br/><p>National History Day introduces both students and their teachers to important cultural and art assets in their communities, where they engage curators at museums, libraries and archives as fellow researchers.

Their project received a first place award at the regional competition and superior and excellent scores at the PA State Finals.  Here’s what they learned: </p><p>“The government that the United States had placed in power (in Puerto Rico) opened fire on over 1,000 unarmed women, children, and many young and old men who dared to protest the jailing of 9 of their fellow countrymen. One hundred fifty adults and children were wounded, 19 killed. Remembering The Ponce Massacre and the spirit of Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos gives all of us the courage, strength, and hope to continue our fight to do what is right. He tried his best, spending his entire life trying to help the people of Puerto Rico. He gave the people hope for their future. He never gave up and he never gave in.  He did the right thing. He set a great example and his words remind all of us to stand up for freedom everywhere.” </p><p>The accomplishment of these students is all the more remarkable, given the odds they faced at school.</p><p>Julia de Burgos Middle School, now closed, was located in one of the most impoverished and dangerous areas of Philadelphia. Over 90% of its students received free lunches. The school did not have evening events due to the level of violence in the community -- mostly shoot-outs and rapes. Drug selling was rampant; crack houses and prostitution were commonplace. Lockdowns were sometimes needed to protect the students from murders just outside the building. At least half of the students are fatherless -- losing their fathers to death, abandonment, or incarceration.</p><p>In this inhospitable learning environment, NHD taught valuable lessons to these students. Said one parent of her son, ""He learned how to be more responsible. It's the first time he put his focus on something. He learned that if you put your effort into something you can get far.""</p><p>""This process, this historical journey, at least in the case of my students, has transformed them into more confident human beings. They have become historical storytellers and learned that there are people in the world that are interested in their interpretation and presentation,"" explained teacher Francine Gold. </p><p>Your gift can help a team like this one to succeed and go on to experience campus life at the statewide competition, as they did.</p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>In a school district where 84% of students are from low-income families and where the high school graduation rate is only 61%, NHDPhilly introduces participants to a pathway for success and untold future opportunities.  Assessment data shows that National History Day students consistently outperform their peers on state standardized tests, not only in social studies but in science and math as well.  They also outperform students who primarily focus in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math).</p><p>Students who demonstrate capabilities in critical thinking, creative problem-solving and communication have a far greater chance of being employed in the workforce than their counterparts without those skills. Consequently, participation in NHDPhilly gives Philadelphia students the skills to be workplace-ready and to compete in the global economy.</p><p>In addition to a path to academic and career success, students get to represent their city as “official ambassadors” and build strong connections to the cultural and arts community. Each year the Mayor honors the students at City Hall and recognizes their accomplishments. The relationships that students develop among themselves and with the broader community, as they do their project work, have led to internships at community organizations.  </p><p>Many NHDPhilly students also get their first exposure to a higher education setting through their residency at higher education institutions along the way. This is especially critical for low-income, at-risk students, whose experiences outside their neighborhoods are so limited.</p><br/><h3>Give the Gift of History -- And Get a Chance at a History Grab Bag</h3><p>When you make a contribution to the campaign, the best gift you get is the knowledge that you are making it possible for students to produce high-quality projects. But you also get a chance to get a little history yourself! Our supporters will be entered in a drawing to receive one of the history baskets listed at the right, with valuable books, DVDs, and history experiences donated by our partners.</p><p></p><h4>What happens to the money if we don’t meet our goal?<br/>What happens to additional money if we exceed our goal? <br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">(and what about those history grab bags???)</span>
</h4><p></p><p>If this campaign falls short of its goal, NHDPhilly will still be able to support student requests for supplies, but may not be able to meet all needs. And we’ll still be drawing names from our donors and awarding the history grab bags.</p><p>If we exceed our goal, the additional funding will allow us to be more generous in our support for supply requests, and can help to fund these other program activities:</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>
<b>Transportation</b>: The cost of providing a school bus to get students from their schools to the Philadelphia competition: $200 per bus (estimated need, 15 buses). Cost of providing transportation for students and their chaperones to the state competition: $2,500 per bus round trip, for a total of $7,500-$10,000 depending on delegation size.</li></ul><ul><li>
<b>Student Competition Participation Assistance</b>: There is no charge to participate in the Philadelphia competition. The cost of participation in the statewide competition is $150 per student for registration fees, lodging, and meals. Many of our students come from families with limited means and would not be able to attend the statewide competition without financial assistance. NHDPhilly is proud that it has always been able to shoulder the cost of participation in the statewide competition for its students.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Spread the Word!</h3><p>You can help us reach an audience of givers. Share the campaign with your friends -- on Facebook or Twitter, or via email.

Total needed --- at least 200 three-panel presentation boards (as many as we can get!), plus a fund for paper, markers, glue, and photocopies at cultural institutions, together with writable CDs and DVDs for websites and documentaries = $6,000There are other program needs (see below). Any surplus funds will help with other program costs, including competition supplies, student transportation, and registration and lodging support for students who advance to the statewide or national competitions.Case Study: From Bullets to Bullet PointsExploring the Ponce Massacre, March 1923 Norma Serrano, Crystal Lugo, Eilsaul Davila, Noemays Figueroa, Yessenia CorderoJulia de Burgos Middle School Pictured here:  the Julia de Burgos students and their projectA few years ago, five six-graders at de Burgos Middle School explored an aspect of history from their families’ region using Spanish language archives. Their project received a first place award at the regional competition and superior and excellent scores at the PA State Finals.  Here’s what they learned: “The government that the United States had placed in power (in Puerto Rico) opened fire on over 1,000 unarmed women, children, and many young and old men who dared to protest the jailing of 9 of their fellow countrymen. One hundred fifty adults and children were wounded, 19 killed. Remembering The Ponce Massacre and the spirit of Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos gives all of us the courage, strength, and hope to continue our fight to do what is right. He tried his best, spending his entire life trying to help the people of Puerto Rico. He gave the people hope for their future. He never gave up and he never gave in.  He did the right thing. He set a great example and his words remind all of us to stand up for freedom everywhere.” The accomplishment of these students is all the more remarkable, given the odds they faced at school.Julia de Burgos Middle School, now closed, was located in one of the most impoverished and dangerous areas of Philadelphia. Over 90% of its students received free lunches. The school did not have evening events due to the level of violence in the community -- mostly shoot-outs and rapes. Drug selling was rampant; crack houses and prostitution were commonplace. Lockdowns were sometimes needed to protect the students from murders just outside the building. At least half of the students are fatherless -- losing their fathers to death, abandonment, or incarceration.In this inhospitable learning environment, NHD taught valuable lessons to these students. Said one parent of her son, ""He learned how to be more responsible. It's the first time he put his focus on something. He learned that if you put your effort into something you can get far.""""This process, this historical journey, at least in the case of my students, has transformed them into more confident human beings. They have become historical storytellers and learned that there are people in the world that are interested in their interpretation and presentation,"" explained teacher Francine Gold. Your gift can help a team like this one to succeed and go on to experience campus life at the statewide competition, as they did.The ImpactIn a school district where 84% of students are from low-income families and where the high school graduation rate is only 61%, NHDPhilly introduces participants to a pathway for success and untold future opportunities.  Assessment data shows that National History Day students consistently outperform their peers on state standardized tests, not only in social studies but in science and math as well.  They also outperform students who primarily focus in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math).Students who demonstrate capabilities in critical thinking, creative problem-solving and communication have a far greater chance of being employed in the workforce than their counterparts without those skills. Consequently, participation in NHDPhilly gives Philadelphia students the skills to be workplace-ready and to compete in the global economy.In addition to a path to academic and career success, students get to represent their city as “official ambassadors” and build strong connections to the cultural and arts community. Each year the Mayor honors the students at City Hall and recognizes their accomplishments. The relationships that students develop among themselves and with the broader community, as they do their project work, have led to internships at community organizations.  Many NHDPhilly students also get their first exposure to a higher education setting through their residency at higher education institutions along the way. This is especially critical for low-income, at-risk students, whose experiences outside their neighborhoods are so limited.Give the Gift of History -- And Get a Chance at a History Grab BagWhen you make a contribution to the campaign, the best gift you get is the knowledge that you are making it possible for students to produce high-quality projects. But you also get a chance to get a little history yourself! Our supporters will be entered in a drawing to receive one of the history baskets listed at the right, with valuable books, DVDs, and history experiences donated by our partners.What happens to the money if we don’t meet our goal?What happens to additional money if we exceed our goal? (and what about those history grab bags???)
If this campaign falls short of its goal, NHDPhilly will still be able to support student requests for supplies, but may not be able to meet all needs. And we’ll still be drawing names from our donors and awarding the history grab bags.If we exceed our goal, the additional funding will allow us to be more generous in our support for supply requests, and can help to fund these other program activities:
Transportation: The cost of providing a school bus to get students from their schools to the Philadelphia competition: $200 per bus (estimated need, 15 buses). Cost of providing transportation for students and their chaperones to the state competition: $2,500 per bus round trip, for a total of $7,500-$10,000 depending on delegation size.
Student Competition Participation Assistance: There is no charge to participate in the Philadelphia competition. The cost of participation in the statewide competition is $150 per student for registration fees, lodging, and meals. Many of our students come from families with limited means and would not be able to attend the statewide competition without financial assistance. NHDPhilly is proud that it has always been able to shoulder the cost of participation in the statewide competition for its students.Spread the Word!You can help us reach an audience of givers. Share the campaign with your friends -- on Facebook or Twitter, or via email. Together we can make sure that NHDPhilly remains a bright spot in the academic year for Philadelphia-area students.REMINDER: Funds are being collected on our behalf by our partner, THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN FOUNDATION OF THE UNION LEAGUE, a verified nonprofit, and your gift acknowledgment will list the Foundation as the recipient.
