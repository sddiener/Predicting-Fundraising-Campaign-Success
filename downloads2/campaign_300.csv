<p>I have come up
with an idea to publish a book of flyers when I was sorting old things, like
books, notebooks etc., out  and found a collection of flyers for
electronic music events that took place in Latvia. All of them had a very
distinct design and reminded of the events they were created for. At that
moment I have realised that flyers were playing inalienable part in every

90s - 00s. They also serve as a reference to Latvian electronic music
culture of that period. </p>
<p>Flyers are not

by now.</p>
<p>The goal of this fundraising campaign is to collect the remaining 298 euro for the digital preparation

</p><p>ABOUT</p>
<p>My name is Linda Storm.  I paint with Pablo Perea; we paint together on the same
canvases. He is Cuban, I am American. Together we have created more than 200 works of  surreal, magical art, We have gallery exhibits scheduled for NY,NY, and Havana, Cuba. We want to trade you art for your donation and use the money for travel, lodging, and insurance expenses to our July 2015 solo exhibit in NY,NY and for art supplies, travel and insurance expenses for our large exhibit in the National Gallery in Havana, Cuba. Any amount is welcome, and for a minimum donation of $75.00 you will have a choice of a work of art.<br/></p>
<p>WHEN WE MET AND BEGAN PAINTING TOGETHER</p>
<p>Five years ago
Pablo moved to rural New Mexico, into the house next-door to me and we became friends.
Our artistic collaboration began during my grief over the loss of my beloved dog. Pablo invited me to paint with him, he promised it would
make me feel better. We titled the painting Fate Up Against Her Will.</p>
<p>WHERE WE PAINT AND HOW</p>
<p>Our Santa Fe, New Mexico. It houses an ever-growing
collection of provocative
paintings: oil wells rooted to dinosaur bones, blue corn ascending, dancing
trees with giant flowers, a child swinging above earthbound spirits. Some of our work is intuitive, some is carefully planned.
We always paint together with respect, confidence and humility. </p>
<p>WHY</p>
<p>Our art proves that people of different cultures can communicate creatively and peacefully. It is more important
than we are as individuals. We are currently painting for our NY,NY exhibit, where we will reveal 100 surreal,
symbolic paintings about the impact of humans on this planet.”<span>  “Linda and I are amazed by the ingeniousness
of humans and threatened by the risks.” says
Pablo. We are also astounded by the process of nature, how it revives after
catastrophes. </span></p>
<p>AWARDS AND RECOGNITION</p>
<p>Since our first all collaborative art exhibit in March, 2014, we won first place in a New York,
New York juried exhibit; and one of our paintings was selected as the cover of
a scholarly book dedicated to renowned scientist Lynn Margulis. We have been invited to exhibit in New York, New York, twice; Havana, Cuba, and Chicago, Illinois. Our
confirmed dates for our solo New York, New York exhibit at New Century Artists
are from June 29th through July 11, 2015 and for Havana, Cuba, in January 2017.<br/>
</p><p>Here is a link to a review of our last exhibit at New Century Artists, during
a group show in 2014: “Their art <a href=""http://artefuse.com/2014/08/13/a-new-century-begins-in-chelsea-123496/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">most
certainly has opened a new window on the horizon indeed for this century in

<p>After 7 years of growth and creativity I feel called to go back home, where the roots of my Heart and the inspiration of my art are present.  I have 3 grown-up kids whom I love and miss, and an 86 years old mother whom I want to support and care for.</p>
<p>I have deep trust that my art will be more easily celebrated, appreciated and bought in my homeland, and I long to sustain myself and give away my gifts, where they are needed and fully received.</p>
<p>I decided to reach out for support because I don't have the funds to move back to Israel with my art. Although I got a lot of recognition to my art and my diverse talents during the years I live here, I wasn't able to sell enough of it on a regular basis to care for my basic needs.</p>
<p>I need money for the flying ticket to Israel, for shipping my art and my studio, which is very costly and for the first months of settling down in Israel. Since I love win-win situations I'd like to offer you the possibility to enjoy my exclusive original art, my Heartwork, commissions and prints while contributing to me.</p>

with pastels, crayons or acrylic after you tape the two parts of the fish together. Tyvek is known to act as a strong light fabric and will decorate
your room or outside, whirling in the wind for a long time.

</div></div>","My name is Yanna Bat Adam  and I have been Arting for the last 30 years of my life.My art is a reflection of my evolutionary path and I love sharing it with people, inspiring and supporting them on their own path.7 years ago, I was invited  to come to California, to perform as a musician in an intentional community focused on developing consciousness through art. In the past year and a half I was here on a Special Artist visa (O-1) and now that the visa is expiring I am asking for your support in helping me move back to my county, Israel and continue to share the message of my art from there.
I am known to most of you as The Heartist - An artist committed to share the wisdom of Higher Worlds in times of crisis and a change to a new paradigm of Loving our neighbors as we love our Self. www.TheHeartist.com www.TheSpiritualHeartist.com




After 7 years of growth and creativity I feel called to go back home, where the roots of my Heart and the inspiration of my art are present.  I have 3 grown-up kids whom I love and miss, and an 86 years old mother whom I want to support and care for.
I have deep trust that my art will be more easily celebrated, appreciated and bought in my homeland, and I long to sustain myself and give away my gifts, where they are needed and fully received.
I decided to reach out for support because I don't have the funds to move back to Israel with my art. Although I got a lot of recognition to my art and my diverse talents during the years I live here, I wasn't able to sell enough of it on a regular basis to care for my basic needs.
I need money for the flying ticket to Israel, for shipping my art and my studio, which is very costly and for the first months of settling down in Israel. Since I love win-win situations I'd like to offer you the possibility to enjoy my exclusive original art, my Heartwork, commissions and prints while contributing to me.


I see this campaign as an opportunity to widen the Heartists on our little planet.As I see it, Heartists are people who prioritize their Heart, are courageous enough to follow it and to act upon it.                                

I'm asking for $9050 to cover my move and build back up my funds. Here's a breakdown:

Fees from IndieGogo (9% if we don't meet my goal, 4% if we do) Paypal and Credit Cards (3%) 
Cost of fulfilling rewards (perks in Indiegogo language)  (prints, shipping, packaging, paint, Swarovsky Crystals etc.) 

Last month's rent in CA

Door to Door moving expenses of my art studio and about 60 paintings: packing, shipping, crating, insurance, papers, etc.

Taxes 

Applying for a B-2 visa that will bridge my status in USA until I'll leave to Israel toward the end of June




If I meet my goal, anything extra will be used to quickly settle in Israel and start immediately to create more of my art that is so needed in times of separation and change                                      





As time is a factor for this campaign ( I need to leave U.S on June) It will definitely create ease for me if you’ll let me intuitively
choose a MiniPrint or MiniHeart for you.



Choosing MiniPrint:  If you still want to choose your own MiniPrint by yourself –
Please look at my websites www.Theheartist.com
and/or www.ThespiritualHeartist.com
and give me 3 options of paintings you wish to receive as your MiniPrint. Leave a message here and send me the links and the name of the paintings.



Choosing Original
MiniHeart: as soon as I’ll finish the MiniHearts miniatures, [Which I’ve
already started to paint] I will gradually add their images to the campaign page.I will number them and you can just let me know which one you prefer. First come, first choose.
  
                          

5”x7”hand made MiniPrints are mostly framed by people who buy them.Embellished, signed Giclee print, glued gently on a white card, with an envelope in a clear
bag, ready to be given to you or your loved ones. 
I'll choose randomly the best match for you.Want a special one? look at my website www.Theheartist.com
and/or www.ThespiritualHeartist.com and let me know which 3 of my paintings you want to be on your MiniPrint. I'll choose one and will send it to you

This fish windsocks are from my Kiting days. It belongs to the category of wind games. It is an easy to make kit that you can paint
with pastels, crayons or acrylic after you tape the two parts of the fish together. Tyvek is known to act as a strong light fabric and will decorate
your room or outside, whirling in the wind for a long time.


Great for family/children gathering activity.  Instructions included.

 are no risks for you even if I don't hit my goal. You will get your perks no matter what. 


I'll will keep you updated every step along the way

Shipping is included if you are in the U.S.  For those outside of 
the U.S., please see the specific perk for how much you need to add to 
your reward. Some of the shipping will be from Israel. 

If you want multiple rewards, you will have to complete the process 
for each reward you want, as IndieGogo doesn't let you combine them.  


I'll follow up with everyone for specifying MiniPrint or MiniHeart you 
want,  (You can also trust the universe and let me choose for you :) commission info, etc., As soon as I'll come to Israel, after settling down I will contact you for scheduling HeartWork as preparation to your HeartArt commission.

Thank you for your contribution and participation as we raise <b>$21,000 </b>to get<i> SOUL Food</i> into Print.   Contribute any amount, as every dollar counts, and SHARE.  Every action you take within the campaign raises our GoGoFactor (the algorithm used to raise our visibility).  <b>The Intention is to have a FULLY FUNDED campaign and Togehter,</b><b> WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN</b><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello, I am Nadine, the creator of this
body of work called <i>SOUL Food.</i>   After surviving cervical
cancer in 2004, I became seriously committed to creating a healthy
life.   I learned the effect negative thoughts and emotions,
as well as certain foods, had on my body and my being well.  
During this process, I dropped 74 pounds from my frame and became an
ambassador for health and well-being by becoming a <i>Naturopath</i>
and <i>Holistic Nutrition Specialist</i>.   I have continued to grow in the past
ten years, including embracing my role as an <i>Intuitive</i>
<i>Healer</i>.   I work with a team of Archangels and Ascended Masters
and bring them forth in <i>Healing/Clairvoyant</i> <i>Sessions</i>.  Browse the <b>Perks </b>to see if something catches your
awareness.  <i>Please feel free to contribute any amount, regardless of what perks are offered</i>. Now, let me introduce you to <i>SOUL Food.</i></p><p>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1377962/files/20150412212301-protogrp3_640.jpg?1428898981"" src="""" style=""width: 561.702px; height: 376px;""/></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>SOUL Food Deck One</i>
is a result of my journey.  The deck is comprised of <i><b>66 cards </b>of
Soulful Nourishment for the Body, Mind, Emotions &amp; Spirit</i>.  
Each <i>SOUL Food</i> card is designed to Inspire, Uplift and
Motivate you, so that you can stay FOCUSED on your Goal.  When you
select a card, you have an opportunity to STOP, Realign with your
Inner Truth, Regain your Focus, and step Forward with Clarity and
Courage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each card allows you to create <i>Balance</i>, take
<i>Ownership of self,</i> take <i>Responsibility for self,</i>
and provide <i>opportunities to LOVE your Self. </i> The reverse
side contains a full description or action step
supporting the inspirational thought on the front of the card.</p>
<p>Each day upon awakening, or anytime you need guidance or
inspiration, shuffle the deck and pull one card on which to focus for that
day. With each new card, you may be <i>Challenged to Grow</i>,
<i>Inspired to Achieve Excellence</i> or <i>Motivated to reach a New
Goal</i>.<br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FnCuTuvgV72Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DnCuTuvgV72Q&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FnCuTuvgV72Q%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>

<p>I believe we are each here to <i><b>Make A Difference</b></i> in
the world, and that difference <i><b>begins within each of us.</b></i>
 When I like myself, I open the door for the person next to me to
like themselves.  When I appreciate myself, I provide a mirror so the
person next to me can discover their self-appreciation.  Likewise,
when I LOVE myself, there is an ""allowing"" that happens for the person
next to me, to find LOVE within themselves.  <i><b>Together WE Make
The Difference</b></i>.  
</p>
<p>My intention is that <i>everyone </i>who sees, touches, handles,
prints, delivers or shares <i>SOUL
Food</i><i><b>, will receive a Healing on some level
</b></i><span>(physically,
mentally, emotionally, spiritually)</span><i><b>.  </b></i><span>As
we share S</span><i>OUL Food</i><span>
and this campaign, we will be sharing an Abundance of Happy, an
Abundance of JOY, an Abundance of Well-being.  By Giving, someone
gets to Receive.  By Receiving, someone gets to Give.  We all make
the difference.  <span><b>Every click, comment, contribution, and share goes into an 
algorithm to raise our GoGoFactor.  </b>You can help to raise this 
GoGoFactor. </span><br/></span></p><p><span>With each and every contribution you make, with each

<p>I need this to be a FULLY FUNDED campaign.  That is the major
hurdle.  Once I know we have reached the $21,000 goal, I will give
the green light to the print team. <i>The entire process will take
three months,</i><br/></p><p> I anticipate I will be able to ship (within the United States) the cards and
companion books to you in September.  Additional time will need to be factored in for all
International shipping. <br/></p>
<p>I stated above that the <i>SOUL Food Deck One app</i> has been
downloaded in 20 countries.  That means folks want to Feel GOOD about
themselves.  I want to reach a larger audience.  I want to reach people who do not have a iphone or ipad.  I want to reach the folks

Thank you for your contribution and participation as we raise $21,000 to get SOUL Food into Print.   Contribute any amount, as every dollar counts, and SHARE.  Every action you take within the campaign raises our GoGoFactor (the algorithm used to raise our visibility).  The Intention is to have a FULLY FUNDED campaign and Togehter, WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN

Hello, I am Nadine, the creator of this
body of work called SOUL Food.   After surviving cervical
cancer in 2004, I became seriously committed to creating a healthy
life.   I learned the effect negative thoughts and emotions,
as well as certain foods, had on my body and my being well.  
During this process, I dropped 74 pounds from my frame and became an
ambassador for health and well-being by becoming a Naturopath
and Holistic Nutrition Specialist.   I have continued to grow in the past
ten years, including embracing my role as an Intuitive
Healer.   I work with a team of Archangels and Ascended Masters
and bring them forth in Healing/Clairvoyant Sessions.  Browse the Perks to see if something catches your
awareness.  Please feel free to contribute any amount, regardless of what perks are offered. Now, let me introduce you to SOUL Food.    

SOUL Food Deck One
is a result of my journey.  The deck is comprised of 66 cards of
Soulful Nourishment for the Body, Mind, Emotions & Spirit.  
Each SOUL Food card is designed to Inspire, Uplift and
Motivate you, so that you can stay FOCUSED on your Goal.  When you
select a card, you have an opportunity to STOP, Realign with your
Inner Truth, Regain your Focus, and step Forward with Clarity and
Courage.

Each card allows you to create Balance, take
Ownership of self, take Responsibility for self,
and provide opportunities to LOVE your Self.  The reverse
side contains a full description or action step
supporting the inspirational thought on the front of the card.
Each day upon awakening, or anytime you need guidance or
inspiration, shuffle the deck and pull one card on which to focus for that
day. With each new card, you may be Challenged to Grow,
Inspired to Achieve Excellence or Motivated to reach a New
Goal.



The prototypes for the
cards have arrived.
The prototypes were created on the actual press,
with our ink and paper weight.  The printer took the first 5 cards in
the deck and made 10 copies of each card.  I used those to create the
bigger picture so you can see many of them all together (remember
there are 66 cards in the deck).            The cards measure 3 x 6 to fit
nicely in your hand.  They will have a layer of laminate on the card
front with a UV coating on the back, to ensure they are tear
resistant.  The deck will retail for $15.95 USD.                                             
This campaign is to raise the $21,000
needed to get SOUL Food into PRINT.  I created the deck in 2005.  At that time, the price quote to
print 1,000 units was simply out of reach.  So my dream was put on the back burner.  

                                
I thought I would never see this body

launched on iTunes in May 2011, and has been downloaded in 20
countries.   Any funds that come in from over-funding of this campaign
will be used toward creating an app for android devices.                                                      Your Willingness to Help raise these
funds is a MIRACLE.   To see this Dream come to life after all these
years brings me PURE JOY.   I would love to see the actual SOUL
Food cards in people's hands, used as conversation starters, see
them in purses, hung in office work space, etc...
all around the world.   It would be kewl to have SOUL Food
on the #1 Best Sellers' List!!!! .  Thank
you for helping me make my Dream come to life.I NEED $21,000 to make this Dream a REALITY.  It is going to take a FULLY FUNDED  campaign. The monies will be
used for:


Box Design the deck of cards will live within 

Print set up (digital proof, printing plates)

PRINT 2,000 units of Soul
	Food deck one  (decks of cards - laminated, cut, collated,
	boxed and shrink wrapped)

	Companion Book Design and Layout 



	Companion Book Print Set up (digital Proofs)


PRINT 1,000 copies of the Soul

I believe we are each here to Make A Difference in
the world, and that difference begins within each of us.
 When I like myself, I open the door for the person next to me to
like themselves.  When I appreciate myself, I provide a mirror so the
person next to me can discover their self-appreciation.  Likewise,
when I LOVE myself, there is an ""allowing"" that happens for the person
next to me, to find LOVE within themselves.  Together WE Make
The Difference.  

My intention is that everyone who sees, touches, handles,
prints, delivers or shares SOUL
Food, will receive a Healing on some level
(physically,
mentally, emotionally, spiritually).  As
we share SOUL Food
and this campaign, we will be sharing an Abundance of Happy, an
Abundance of JOY, an Abundance of Well-being.  By Giving, someone
gets to Receive.  By Receiving, someone gets to Give.  We all make
the difference.  Every click, comment, contribution, and share goes into an 
algorithm to raise our GoGoFactor.  You can help to raise this 
GoGoFactor. With each and every contribution you make, with each
and every share you do, we co-create our world with an Abundance of
HAPPINESS, JOY, and WELL-BEING.

I need this to be a FULLY FUNDED campaign.  That is the major
hurdle.  Once I know we have reached the $21,000 goal, I will give
the green light to the print team. The entire process will take
three months, I anticipate I will be able to ship (within the United States) the cards and
companion books to you in September.  Additional time will need to be factored in for all
International shipping. 
I stated above that the SOUL Food Deck One app has been
downloaded in 20 countries.  That means folks want to Feel GOOD about
themselves.  I want to reach a larger audience.  I want to reach people who do not have a iphone or ipad.  I want to reach the folks
who love having a tangible deck of cards to shuffle and play with.it is going to take a fully funded campaign, so LET'S GO FOR IT!!!! 
If you are unable to contribute to this campaign financially, you
can still help in so many ways.  Here are a few ideas:


Add your Energy.  My
	intention is that this Campaign will be fully funded. 
	Visualize this happening with me, SEE SOUL Food in PRINT. 
	Visualize SOUL
	Food on the #1 Best Sellers' list.


Help me get the word out. 
	Share the campaign link http://igg.me/at/soulfood
	on your social media platforms, mailing lists, websites.  Please add a bit about how you know me, or your experience with the cards.  Let's get folks
	exCiTed about this campaign.


Use the share
	tools provided by Indiegogo.  Every click, comment, contribution, and share goes into an 
algorithm to raise our GoGoFactor.  When our GoGoFactor is HIGH, IndieGoGo will see this campaign and move us into a more visible position

If you are willing to have a
	banner on your website, please let me know.  I will provide
	you with two banner options and the campaign URL.  You can then link
	the banner directly to this campaign. 

Provide a Video or Audio
	Testimonial.  As mentioned above, many of you have been using
	the SOUL Food app on your iphone or ipad.  I would LOVE to
	share your experiences with the world.  Send me a video or
	audio clip on how YOU  use the cards, how they are allowing you
	to shift and stay focused on your goals.  I will combine all of your
	testimonials into a video and add it to a campaign update.

Talk to me about selling the  SOUL Food  cards and companion book in your store or place of business.  Let's discuss retail rates.

Invite me on a Radio Show, Podcast, etc ~
	we can discuss how LOVE is the Path to Conscious Healing and
	highlight SOUL Food and this campaign.

Let
	me know if you have other ideas on how to share SOUL Food
	with the world and THANK YOU
	for helping me get folks
	exCiTed about this campaign





Each color within the artwork on the SOUL Food cards has meaning.  Violet represents the transformation and transmutation of 
Energy.  For those of you who follow Energy, St Germain holds this Violet Flame.  Pink represents the Sacred Heart where we reconnect to our Higher 
Self.  In the center of the image you see a Golden Column of Light; this is the Column of Light we each stand within as we become the
 connection to Heaven and Earth.  I presented my 'conceptual' ideas to Amy Laner of ANJO Designs, and she is the heart of the visual design of these cards.  As a talented and versatile graphic designer, Amy adds the spark to SOUL Food with her flare for color, shape and style.  I LOVE what Amy has created for all of us to share.   Amy can be
contacted at amy.n.laner@gmail.commore to come about WHY there are 66 cards.Ways the deck of SOUL Food cards can
be used:* Pick a card a day, a week, an hour* Pick a card
to start a conversation* Pick a card when you are ready for a
SHIFT* Pick a card when you are ready for a CHALLENGE* Pick a
card when you need SUPPORT
The deck was Joyfully created with lots of Permission for you to
Explore new options that will open doors and Allow Harmony into your
life.

I want to thank EVERYONE who contributed to making this dream come true.
Your edits, feedback and LOVE have allowed this project to come to
fruition. From the bottom of my heart, a Huge THANK YOU !!!! ~ Nadine",25.0,6,"1 Campaign

<b></b><p><b>The Dream.</b></p>
<p>It starts with a dream. </p>
<p>To make them come true it takes a lot of hard work, dedication, perseverance and seizing of opportunities. </p>
<p>My name is Kat.  I’m a Los Angeles based fine artist and I’ve been pursuing painting for the past five years.  I do the best I can in order to push my creations forward, but I've come to realize that my lack of academic ability is preventing me from successfully translating my ideas onto the canvas. </p>
<p>I decided to go back to school and found that the Repin Academy in St.Petersburg, Russia was where I wanted to study.  Through a long and arduous process I finally got the approval and invitation to attend and my next step was to finalize my Visa. </p>
<p>That's when I got robbed. </p>
<p>All the money I was saving for my education, practically my life savings, jewelry and my legal documents were gone in one sweep.  This changed many things in my life. </p>
<p>I'm not ready to give up yet.</p>
<p> I set out to expand my education, and I’m giving it one more shot... but I need your help. </p>
<p> This time I’ve decided to stay in Los Angeles.  </p>
<p>If you can donate to help me fund my studies in any amount I will be forever grateful.  In exchange for your kindness I have devised a reward system. Please feel free to check it out and reach out if you have any questions. </p>
<p>If you can't donate and would like to help in some other way, that will, of course, be very appreciated as well.  </p>
<p>Please spread the word.</p>

<p><b>The Art.</b></p>
<p>My art is my the ultimate outlet.  My paintings, photographs, and journals are more than simple stills and scribbles of my surroundings.  To me, they convey with fidelity moments of my life story and the people I was with.  They are meticulous compositions narrating my goals, views, observations, philosophy and psychology.</p>
<p><b>The Goal.</b></p>
<p>What I intend to gain from my education is broader understanding and ability to execute fundamental basic and advanced artistic concepts allowing me to create with confidence.</p>
<p>Ultimately I would like my fine art to develop its own distinct visual language and to gain the ability to translate personal moments and modern concepts of the intricacies of society into my developing body of work which will hopefully transcend my own time.</p>
<p><b>My Career.</b></p>
<p>So far in my professional, fine art career I've been featured in multiple gallery and museum shows, won some awards and have been included for three consecutive years in the highly selective California Art Club Gold Medal Show. In addition, I’ve been interviewed and published in various art books and magazines.  Currently, I'm being represented by Abend Gallery in Denver, Colorado, Preferred Plants in Rochester, NY and work extensively with California Art Club in Los Angeles. </p>

<p>I've chosen the L.A. studio, Safehouse Atelier founded by Carl Dobsky to continue my education.  He is very prominent within the entertainment and fine art industry, as well as having the reputation of an excellent educator.  My goal is study there for the full suggested enrollment time of two years. </p>
<p>The funds I am requesting will cover a single year of my education, the materials necessary for the course, specialty artist workshops and transportation.

<p><b>The Art Materials.</b></p>
<p>My medium of choice for my sketches is pen and ink.  This work is very time consuming since it's based on precisely placed, tiny lines.  One small project can easily run over the course of a week.  I do take advantage of exploring pencil, charcoal, watercolor and gouache as well. </p>
<p>Sculpting is my favorite hobby.  So you’ll see me working on something from time to time.  I enjoy working with soft and medium hardness oil based clay. </p>
<p>My paintings are done on board or on linen which are hand stretched and primed. I use oil paints and work from both life and photographs.  My paintings are also labor intensive as I do sketches, small value studies and small color studies as I prepare for the final piece.  There have been times when a patron has not only kept the final product but requested to purchase the studies as well.  In such cases, I have obliged.  </p>

<div>
<p>We are Changing Face Collective; a visual arts and theatre collective of like-minded individuals who find art a valuable and resourceful way of expressing political perspectives. We create art to reflect the changes happening within the
communities we live and work in. </p>
<p>Our Collective is ever-growing; we are always
interested in collaborating with other Lambeth-based artists. Specialising in theatre, film, illustration and photography, we are interested in showcasing them in unusual spaces. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432656402/zwstvgb0copzreswdwz7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div> <p></p>
<p>We have embarked on our next Project, ’Changing Face’,
which responds to Brixton's and, indeed, Lambeth's changing face as a community, specifically reacting
to the mass evictions of social housing tenants and shop-owners. Across
Lambeth, six housing estates are threatened with demolition and thousands of people
face eviction along with hundreds of independent businesses that define
Brixton’s multiculturalism.</p>
<p></p>
<div>A documentation and celebration of Brixton’s past, present and future, this project combines photography with film and verbatim theatre. We want to create an immersive experience taking the audience on a journey, virtually and theatrically, to meet the people directly affected by these changes. </div>
<p>The Collective is conducting in-depth interviews with over 100 people and organisations and a resulting
verbatim script will be an authentic account of the interviewees’ experience of
eviction through ‘neighbourhood improvement’, delivered in a simple yet
theatrically-compelling way.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Where will it be...</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This piece will be delivered in a mixture of locations, from unusual spaces to theatres, to attract a new public. A few of our venues include:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">An evicted shop on Brixton Station Road -once an independent store, is now an empty shell waiting to be turned into a chain store earning
high rents for its evicting landlord, Network Rail. </span></li>

</ol>
<div>
<p>Our project will be taken on tour to areas such as Hackney, Peckham, Camden and Stokes Croft, Bristol. </p>
<p>We need your help to make this project a success and for it to be taken on tour around London and other cities. This is so that Lambeth's voice is heard along with areas where similar changes can be seen and to highlight to these communities that they are not alone. </p>

</div></div>","Who are we...

We are Changing Face Collective; a visual arts and theatre collective of like-minded individuals who find art a valuable and resourceful way of expressing political perspectives. We create art to reflect the changes happening within the
communities we live and work in. 
Our Collective is ever-growing; we are always
interested in collaborating with other Lambeth-based artists. Specialising in theatre, film, illustration and photography, we are interested in showcasing them in unusual spaces. 


Our next project...
 
We have embarked on our next Project, ’Changing Face’,
which responds to Brixton's and, indeed, Lambeth's changing face as a community, specifically reacting
to the mass evictions of social housing tenants and shop-owners. Across
Lambeth, six housing estates are threatened with demolition and thousands of people
face eviction along with hundreds of independent businesses that define
Brixton’s multiculturalism.

A documentation and celebration of Brixton’s past, present and future, this project combines photography with film and verbatim theatre. We want to create an immersive experience taking the audience on a journey, virtually and theatrically, to meet the people directly affected by these changes. 
The Collective is conducting in-depth interviews with over 100 people and organisations and a resulting
verbatim script will be an authentic account of the interviewees’ experience of
eviction through ‘neighbourhood improvement’, delivered in a simple yet
theatrically-compelling way.  


Where will it be...

This piece will be delivered in a mixture of locations, from unusual spaces to theatres, to attract a new public. A few of our venues include:


An evicted shop on Brixton Station Road -once an independent store, is now an empty shell waiting to be turned into a chain store earning
high rents for its evicting landlord, Network Rail. 
A social
housing flat on Cressingham Gardens which hasn’t been lived in for years
despite a housing shortage.
A car-park in Peckham
Bussey Buildings
PRSC, a multi-purpose art venue in Stokes Croft, Bristol


Our project will be taken on tour to areas such as Hackney, Peckham, Camden and Stokes Croft, Bristol. 
We need your help to make this project a success and for it to be taken on tour around London and other cities. This is so that Lambeth's voice is heard along with areas where similar changes can be seen and to highlight to these communities that they are not alone. 

We need your help...
Your contribution, small or large, will go towards:
- Rehearsal Spaces
- Venue Hire
- Leaflets
- Programmes
- Photography film
- Lighting and filming equipment
- Script-publishing and more 
We want our work to be available online and in libraries - as a form of documentation so those in the future can learn from - and we want the information we have gathered to be easily accessible. 
Please give what you can as we really appreciate your support.

<p>Greetings, friend! We are Dark Labyrinth Entertainment: a company established in the Buffalo, NY region that brings together artists, creators, students and passionate entertainers to create personal, theatrical, awe-inspiring experiences for our patrons. We forge these experiences on the unique, spirited energy of the Halloween season. With Halloween as our foundation, it gives us unparalleled creative license; the possibilities are endless!</p>
<p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>With over 14 years of experience in the haunt industry, celebrating Halloween is just the beginning. It’s the people that really make the vision of Dark Labyrinth come to life. Dark Labyrinth Entertainment was founded by owner, lead organizer and Halloween aficionado Mike Raisch. At 13, Mike began to successfully organize annual charity haunts in his backyard. He took this passion on to college at the State University of New York at Fredonia by creating a self-designed Bachelors Degree in Halloween Entertainment Business. Since then, Dark Labyrinth Entertainment has been put on the map during the past two Halloween seasons by creating a revolutionary, immersive 4D-theatre-style audio experience. These past projects have all been diverse in their subject matter and appearance, yet they all have one thing in common: bringing people together!</p>
<p>And that’s what Dark Labyrinth is all about: community, creativity, education and entertainment. We are here to offer something different. As our culture shifts, we understand that experience-based entertainment is the next generation of fun. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1288396/files/20150311201254-Haunted_Backyard_Article_1.jpg?1426129974"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $10,000 with IndieGogo, although the entire haunted house project will take about $88,000 to make happen. $10,000 will get us started and give us the capital needed to take out a loan for the grand total. Even in the event that the goal is not reached, the project will still move forward! The greater the contribution, however, the greater the final product will be. No matter what the end result, every single dollar and dime will go toward making our haunt the most detailed, high quality, immersive experience for everyone! </p>
<p>The funds will be broken down as follows:</p>
<p>$13,000 for Marketing: used to spread the word about our haunt in unique, intriguing and professional ways.</p>
<p>$20,000 for Leasing and building expenses: used to land the perfect space for our construction needs to give you, our patrons, the safest and best possible experience. </p>
<p>$30,000 for Materials: used to obtain raw materials for set building, props, costumes, technical effects and even proper equipment to ensure everyone’s safety.</p>
<p>$25,000 for Employees: used to properly compensate our talented builders, actors, designers and hardworking helpers.</p>

<p>You can also become part of the story by becoming one of our serial killer’s victims! People are just <i>dying</i> to play a role!<br/></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>We have been running successful haunts since 2001 when we raised money for 9/11 relief efforts through the Haunted Backyard project. Until now, these projects have been on a relatively small scale. We’ve contributed to charities like Make-A-Wish and other smaller local charities. But even while small, we’ve been able to achieve over $13,000 for charity within 5 years! This means that with your help, we can make an even bigger impact on the local demographic that will drive support for even greater charity efforts in the future.</p>
<p>Education and creativity are fundamental to our company. That’s why, in an effort to spread the power of creativity, this coming Halloween season’s event will be the result of a Master’s Project in conjunction with the Creative Studies program at Buffalo State College. That being said, we also believe education and creativity are fundamental to the community and the world. We want to continue to support the ideals of education and creativity as much as possible! One of the ways we plan to do this as a company is to establish scholarships that we can award to students  who are using their education to follow their dreams. </p>
<p>Our vision is about something more than just a Haunted House. Dark Labyrinth Entertainment is setting out to be a beacon for creativity, education and self-expression. Sometimes the best place to find the light of self-expression is in the creative, haunted darkness! And we’re here to prove that this creative journey is a fun one. It’s all about helping individuals find their light in a world that can sometimes overshadow them.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>There is always risk in creative endeavors because inherently we are trying something totally new. The biggest challenge will be changing the way Buffalo perceives Halloween Entertainment. In our area, people have been accustomed to going to a haunted attraction that has the most haunted houses because you feel you get the best bang for your buck. It has been this way for as long as haunted houses have been in the area. Our job is to show Buffalo that more does not mean better. You generally wouldn’t go to the movie theatre to watch as many short films as possible. A single epic movie is more effective and gives you more to think and talk about. It’s the overall quality of the experience that matters! Additionally, our experience will take the same amount of time that it would take to go through four or five shorter ones. It will take some adjustment for the Buffalo patrons to buy into this concept, but we are confident that once people start to experience our novel haunt, the word will spread like wildfire.</p>

<p>Up to this point, all of our haunts have been on real estate that did not require a lease because it was in our backyard or on a school campus.

</div></div>","What is Dark Labyrinth Entertainment?
Greetings, friend! We are Dark Labyrinth Entertainment: a company established in the Buffalo, NY region that brings together artists, creators, students and passionate entertainers to create personal, theatrical, awe-inspiring experiences for our patrons. We forge these experiences on the unique, spirited energy of the Halloween season. With Halloween as our foundation, it gives us unparalleled creative license; the possibilities are endless!
Who are we?
With over 14 years of experience in the haunt industry, celebrating Halloween is just the beginning. It’s the people that really make the vision of Dark Labyrinth come to life. Dark Labyrinth Entertainment was founded by owner, lead organizer and Halloween aficionado Mike Raisch. At 13, Mike began to successfully organize annual charity haunts in his backyard. He took this passion on to college at the State University of New York at Fredonia by creating a self-designed Bachelors Degree in Halloween Entertainment Business. Since then, Dark Labyrinth Entertainment has been put on the map during the past two Halloween seasons by creating a revolutionary, immersive 4D-theatre-style audio experience. These past projects have all been diverse in their subject matter and appearance, yet they all have one thing in common: bringing people together!
And that’s what Dark Labyrinth is all about: community, creativity, education and entertainment. We are here to offer something different. As our culture shifts, we understand that experience-based entertainment is the next generation of fun. 
What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise $10,000 with IndieGogo, although the entire haunted house project will take about $88,000 to make happen. $10,000 will get us started and give us the capital needed to take out a loan for the grand total. Even in the event that the goal is not reached, the project will still move forward! The greater the contribution, however, the greater the final product will be. No matter what the end result, every single dollar and dime will go toward making our haunt the most detailed, high quality, immersive experience for everyone! 
The funds will be broken down as follows:
$13,000 for Marketing: used to spread the word about our haunt in unique, intriguing and professional ways.
$20,000 for Leasing and building expenses: used to land the perfect space for our construction needs to give you, our patrons, the safest and best possible experience. 
$30,000 for Materials: used to obtain raw materials for set building, props, costumes, technical effects and even proper equipment to ensure everyone’s safety.
$25,000 for Employees: used to properly compensate our talented builders, actors, designers and hardworking helpers.
$88,000 Total
There are so many ways you can help!
Pledging now will get you admission tickets at a discounted rate ($20 value for single admission).
You can receive a t-shirt with the face of our most admired character, Jasper Von Lure:Or a Dark Labyrinth Novelty Keyring Bottle Opener:

You can also become part of the story by becoming one of our serial killer’s victims! People are just dying to play a role!
The Impact
We have been running successful haunts since 2001 when we raised money for 9/11 relief efforts through the Haunted Backyard project. Until now, these projects have been on a relatively small scale. We’ve contributed to charities like Make-A-Wish and other smaller local charities. But even while small, we’ve been able to achieve over $13,000 for charity within 5 years! This means that with your help, we can make an even bigger impact on the local demographic that will drive support for even greater charity efforts in the future.
Education and creativity are fundamental to our company. That’s why, in an effort to spread the power of creativity, this coming Halloween season’s event will be the result of a Master’s Project in conjunction with the Creative Studies program at Buffalo State College. That being said, we also believe education and creativity are fundamental to the community and the world. We want to continue to support the ideals of education and creativity as much as possible! One of the ways we plan to do this as a company is to establish scholarships that we can award to students  who are using their education to follow their dreams. 
Our vision is about something more than just a Haunted House. Dark Labyrinth Entertainment is setting out to be a beacon for creativity, education and self-expression. Sometimes the best place to find the light of self-expression is in the creative, haunted darkness! And we’re here to prove that this creative journey is a fun one. It’s all about helping individuals find their light in a world that can sometimes overshadow them.
Risks & Challenges
There is always risk in creative endeavors because inherently we are trying something totally new. The biggest challenge will be changing the way Buffalo perceives Halloween Entertainment. In our area, people have been accustomed to going to a haunted attraction that has the most haunted houses because you feel you get the best bang for your buck. It has been this way for as long as haunted houses have been in the area. Our job is to show Buffalo that more does not mean better. You generally wouldn’t go to the movie theatre to watch as many short films as possible. A single epic movie is more effective and gives you more to think and talk about. It’s the overall quality of the experience that matters! Additionally, our experience will take the same amount of time that it would take to go through four or five shorter ones. It will take some adjustment for the Buffalo patrons to buy into this concept, but we are confident that once people start to experience our novel haunt, the word will spread like wildfire.

Up to this point, all of our haunts have been on real estate that did not require a lease because it was in our backyard or on a school campus. This time we will be in a building all on our own and there will be many learning experiences along the way (i.e. building permits and safety requirements, etc.). We are working closely with the Small Business Development Center on the Buffalo State campus to ensure we cross our t’s and dot our i’s.

<p></p>RIKKI KASSO b. 1979, New York City. Currently residing in 
Byron Bay, Australia, the self taught art director, photographer and 
multi disciplinary visual artist left his native New York City for Tokyo
 in 2003 on an invite from VOGUE JAPAN to host a retrospective of his 
works from 1999-2002 at the Rocket Gallery, Omotesando. The next 9 years
 were spent in Tokyo (Shibuya) immersed in the unique and ancient 
Japanese culture which not only influenced his art making practices but 
permeated it’s way through his entire being. Kasso’s artistic virtuosity
 is effortlessly translated through a variety of mediums and expressions
 from photography and film to paintings, drawings, and installations. 
His remarkable vision is presented through juxtaposed images of feminine
 sexuality, timeless landscapes and heavenly realities. The artist is 
remarkable in his ability to maintain eroticism in his work without ever
 losing delicacy or resorting to crudity, to express a gesture that 
suggests an entire erotic narrative, sometimes dreamlike and sometimes 
suggestively sadistic, but always in a language of love.

<p>The photographs were taken in the heart of Byron Bay, more 
specifically on a beach and in a Tea tree lake just behind Rikki’s 
studio. The meaning behind the location is particularly notable for this
 project . These Tea Tree lakes were ancient aboriginal spas in order to fight
 the inevitable influence of time .</p>

Byron Bay, Australia, the self taught art director, photographer and 
multi disciplinary visual artist left his native New York City for Tokyo
 in 2003 on an invite from VOGUE JAPAN to host a retrospective of his

Japanese culture which not only influenced his art making practices but 
permeated it’s way through his entire being. Kasso’s artistic virtuosity
 is effortlessly translated through a variety of mediums and expressions
 from photography and film to paintings, drawings, and installations. 
His remarkable vision is presented through juxtaposed images of feminine
 sexuality, timeless landscapes and heavenly realities. The artist is 
remarkable in his ability to maintain eroticism in his work without ever
 losing delicacy or resorting to crudity, to express a gesture that 
suggests an entire erotic narrative, sometimes dreamlike and sometimes 
suggestively sadistic, but always in a language of love.

SOME OF THE ARTWORKS:“Art also is entertainment for the voyeuristic, a peek inside the mind of the creative force, a perverse analysis of an everyday activity of creating beauty. Idolising timeless preservation where mind meets matter. So in its complete reflection, my works are of an observance of the unseen, a voyeur to my own existence.“ - Rikki Kasso

SOME OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS:
The photographs were taken in the heart of Byron Bay, more 
specifically on a beach and in a Tea tree lake just behind Rikki’s 
studio. The meaning behind the location is particularly notable for this
 project . These Tea Tree lakes were ancient aboriginal spas in order to fight
 the inevitable influence of time .












-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE VIDEO INSTALLATION:
Under the naturally golden tea tree waters in Tallow Creek, a woman is reborn. Breathless and alive. This video installation produced in the mystical waters of Byron Bay and projected in to the mysterious caverns of the Rotterdam Vaults with original music by J. Hats 








-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

September 24- November 5, 2015, the second Jerusalem Biennale of Contemporary Jewish Art will host nine different shows throughout Jerusalem. We are proud to announce our exhibit ""Ima Iyla'a/The Supernal Mother"" was selected by an eminent jury to be shown in a venue located in central Jerusalem.

Help us realize the only exhibit at the Biennale solely exploring expressions of Motherhood: The first art exhibit of its kind in Israel.  

Our international team of four professional Jewish mother artists and curators are taking on powerful forces in the art world, insisting that the multi-dimensional  archetype of mother merits serious artistic reflection and expression.  


Our exhibition expands the conversation on motherhood in the postmodern age of Jewish contemporary art.  The works provide a range of perspectives from mothers and their children, raising complex feelings and existential questions. 

Our multi-disciplinary exhibit includes works from emerging and renown artists from a variety of Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds including Joan Roth, Joy Rose, Maya Zack, Dovid Baruch Wolk, Alana Ruben Free, David Gerstein and architect Burak Pekoglu. 
Visitors will be invited to interact and participate with the exhibited works in an attempt to realize the collective experience of mother.  An added challenge to the visual repertoire is our determination to include the ultra-Orthodox community, as both artists and viewers, within contemporary, conceptual art.

Bezalel Academy's Orthodox program and The Jerusalem Foundation are two of our organizational sponsors; however, we still do not have enough money to cover our budget. 

What We Need & What You Get

The artists and their works are important to us and our team is reaching out to you to help us cover costs.   In
order to exhibit with the care and quality that is required, our team needs
to raise $10,000 to cover transportation, building of special installations, printing costs, and extra promotional material.
What
are we offering to generous partnerships?
Supporter: ($36 or more) will receive a limited edition photograph of Alana Ruben Free and David Gerstein's ""Presence=Present"" which will be unveiled at the Biennale. 

Sponsors: ($100 or more) will be listed in the brochure at the front door of the exhibit.

The Impact


""Ima Iyla'a: The Art of Motherhood"" brings to the contemporary art world and particularly the Jewish art scene this ancient icon, the ever-evolving energy of the shechina and images of mothers, both spiritual and mundane. 


Your sponsorship is required to make this happen with quality, inspiration and meaning.

The Biennale is recognized by the Biennale Foundation, The Jerusalem Foundation, and the Jerusalem Municipality.  The project is gathering tributes

<p><b>Cuberosity is a Burning Man 2015 art project. A giant cube resting on its corner, it will appear as if it crashed into the desert and took root.

<h2>Day</h2>
<p>As the sun rises over playa, the lower shade sails open into awnings to increase airflow and transform the structure into an inviting space. Inside, people can enjoy seating and sculptures on a canvas drop cloth floor. Aerial silks may be suspended within.</p>
<h2>Night</h2><p></p>
<p>Images, footage and shadows will be projected on to the shade sails, making the cube glow in the night! Inside, people can dance and play with their gigantic shadows. Imagine a storyteller with gestures multiplied by his shadow. Or a dancer whose magnified body motion can be seen across playa.</p>
<h2>After Burn</h2>
<p>We will not be burning Cuberosity at Burning Man. It will live on. In addition to events by DC regional groups, Cuberosity will be available for events by groups from other regions, mostly Mid-Atlantic states burns and art festivals. We aim to make Cuberosity easy to transport and assemble to facilitate its re-use.</p>
<h2>Why You Should Trust Us To Pull This Off</h2>
<p>The DC region has a history of creating geometrical art for Burning Man starting with the DC National Treasure obelisk in 2012, followed by the DC Pyramid Scheme in 2013 and last year’s Pyramid of Possibilities. For Burning Man 2015 we’re bringing a half cube. Mark Brailsford, the project lead, worked on both the 2013 and 2014 projects. </p>
<h1>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h1>
<p>We will be spending more than $15,000 to pull this off. Using all-volunteer labor, all of the funds will be used for materials like steel, shade sails, light strips, electronics, wiring, generator and insurance, as well as transportation of everything to and from Burning Man.</p>
<p>The first $2,500 in contributions will be matched, dollar-for-dollar, by a small group of very generous project backers!! When you put in $25... we get $50!</p>
<p>Of course, you also get our undying gratitude, a nice tax deduction, and awesome Cuberosity goodies.</p>

</b></h2></div><p>Hello and welcome to our campaign page! My name is Kamilo Nollas and 
I'm the heart and soul of the Vovousa Mountain Festival, a condensed 
dose of culture injected into Mt. Pindos once a year, since 2013.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436650027/y79y9uikd9mkk0ctajca.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Vovousa in the morning mist. Photo by George Detsis</i></p>
<p>We started this festival as a peaceful protest against the Aöos dam that flows right through my grandparents' village and threatens to destroy a way of life that has been passed down through generations. Vovousa is a traditional logger's village, quiet and sleepy, that could certainly use some new blood but not the kind the dam proposes to bring, violating national park territory.
</p>
<p>Up until now, the magnitude of the festival extended to a weekend gathering of regular Vovousa visitors, local folk and people from nearby villages to watch films, enjoy a brief photo show and attend a music performance. Three years down the line, things have gotten serious!</p>

<p></p>
<br/>We have planned a full week of film screenings, workshops, lectures, children’s activities, music performances, photography exhibitions and more, hoping to establish the Vovousa Festival as a newfound tradition. You might think this is personal - no argument there! But don't you think it's time we all took the Greek mountains personally?<br/><br/><h3>What We Need
</h3>
</div><div>
<div>We need your support to make a lasting impression on the region.<span style=""background-color: initial;""> We don't want this to just be a summer fling.

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Let's be honest, it's only two weeks to the festival and we've already moved ahead with almost everything we were hoping to achieve with this campaign in the best way we knew how. Capital controls imposed on Greece did not allows us to launch this effort earlier, as PayPal has been suspended for our region. So the biggest challenge we're looking at right now is not being able to make payments to our service providers and festival staffers, who dove into this in good faith.</p>
<p>This is our first year as a full-fledged festival (yay!) and although we have a lot of ""in-kind"" sponsorships, we have only managed to secure 2.000 Euros in term of financial support. The crisis has not been good to nascent cultural initiatives like our own, and although we have a track record to prove we can pull this off, support has not been forthcoming. Which is why this campaign will run well into August, hoping we can run on empty until then and pay the bills after the festival is over. We're relying on you to help us pull through.  </p>

Hello and welcome to our campaign page! My name is Kamilo Nollas and 
I'm the heart and soul of the Vovousa Mountain Festival, a condensed 
dose of culture injected into Mt. Pindos once a year, since 2013.

Vovousa in the morning mist. Photo by George Detsis
We started this festival as a peaceful protest against the Aöos dam that flows right through my grandparents' village and threatens to destroy a way of life that has been passed down through generations. Vovousa is a traditional logger's village, quiet and sleepy, that could certainly use some new blood but not the kind the dam proposes to bring, violating national park territory.

Up until now, the magnitude of the festival extended to a weekend gathering of regular Vovousa visitors, local folk and people from nearby villages to watch films, enjoy a brief photo show and attend a music performance. Three years down the line, things have gotten serious!





We have planned a full week of film screenings, workshops, lectures, children’s activities, music performances, photography exhibitions and more, hoping to establish the Vovousa Festival as a newfound tradition. You might think this is personal - no argument there! But don't you think it's time we all took the Greek mountains personally?What We Need


We need your support to make a lasting impression on the region. We don't want this to just be a summer fling. We want to start a new tradition, leaving infrastructure behind, so we don't have to start each festival from scratch. Here's where your money - should you choose to part with it - will go:
  We want to host all the artists, writers, musicians etc who will donate their skills and time to make this a bigger and better festival. We want to be able to provide room and board for them all, which we are currently unable to do. [3,500 Euros]
We want to repurpose defunct warehouses to host cultural events, which means paints jobs and electrical wiring, seating and weatherproofing, as we would like our photography exhibition to continue well into the Fall. [1,500 Euros]
We want to transport and insure the artworks of five different photography shows that have to make the trek from Athens to Vovousa (300miles), which is a lot more expensive than you might think! [1,500 Euros]  
We want to cover website and social media maintenance, which includes everything from developer & graphic designer salaries to mailchimp credits [1,500 Euros]
We want to put out ""Aöos"", a daily newspaper issued throughout the festival, with two additional editions during the winter months, to keep Vovousa in the limelight [1000 Euros]

<p>My 7-year old daughter, Kylie, has struggled through more
emotional turmoil than any child her age should ever have to experience and yet
her spirit is unbroken. She has found her own outlets and talents and I have had
the pleasure of watching her confidence grow she takes her own journey down the
path self-discovery. In gymnastics, she has advanced two levels beyond her age
group and she continues to put forth effort and hard work into learning new
skills. She says “Mommy, my dream is to be in the Olympics someday.” Kylie is
also very much enchanted by science and nature and she can’t get enough of the
outdoors. Whether it’s fishing, swimming, camping or just walking through the
woods, when she is surrounded by the beauty of nature it is plain to see that
she is in her happy place.  Unfortunately, with the rising cost of summer
camp and after-school care, I don’t think we can afford the cost of gymnastics
or camp on my salary this summer. </p>
<p>Sometimes life may take you down a rough path,
but the universe will always provide you with enough tools to survive. Even if
those tools are hidden deep within. The resources are there if you look hard
enough and are willing to go to any length. My burden of privilege is the
eternal care for another life that I created. Sometimes my economic
insecurities get the best of me and I am unable to provide the life I wish I
could for my 7-year-old daughter. I was blessed with an artistic talent that
has served no real purpose in my life aside from the ability to express myself
on paper. I realized that my abilities may serve a greater purpose than for my
own enjoyment. I hope to fund my daughter’s talent in gymnastics and her many
other interests, with my talent in the arts and with your support.</p>

</p><p><strong>
<a href=""www.maribelladexter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WHO AM I</a></strong></p><p>
</p><p>I am a painter
living and working in North London. I moved from Germany to the UK in
my early 20ies to attend university and whilst there discovered a much deeper way to express
myself, through painting. <br/></p><p>
</p><p>I
knew I had to pursue a career in art when
I met master painter <a href=""www.theworlingtonmovement.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rosa Branson MBE </a>in late 2009. I didn’t know anything
about drawing or oil painting then, but fortunately Rosa took me on as a
student.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435675892/rmk4infcgpwktbhzftls.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Rosa and I (once painted and once in person) at the unveiling of Rosa's painting for Moorfields Eye Hospital.</i><br/><p>
</p><p>Over time, Rosa developed enough
faith in me as a painter, not only to mentor me, but also provide me with
accommodation and a studio in her home. She will continue to support me in this
way throughout the whole of my studies at LARA.</p><p>
</p><p>Rosa’s encouragement, inspiration
and tough advice have been essential to my journey; so much so that I became a full time painter in 2012. I have never looked back!</p><p><strong>WHAT HAPPENED SINCE THEN?</strong></p><p>The last three years have been

</p></div>","HI
I’m Tanja, and I’m fundraising to
attend LARA, which is the London Atelier of Representational Art.  The course starts on September 28th 2015!LARA?At LARA, they teach art as
draughtsmanship. They focus on the fundamental technical elements of drawing
and painting, in the classical Italian atelier set-up.   Drawings : Luca Indraccolo | Instructor at LARA""Influenced by the Atelier Method of instruction, the unique emphasis of this course is the practice of working directly from the life model. A continuous pose of no less than a week and up to a month under unvarying light, gives optimum time to observe the figure and understand how to “see”. Working with tutors 6 hours a day and using the “sight- size” method we aim to teach essential concepts of proportion, line, gesture, form and light to best master expression of the human form."" ~ LARAAt LARA
I will learn the tools I need to express the visions I have, to translate
into paintings what I feel about this world and to capture what I see when I
look at the beauty every single person carries within them.

WHO AM I
I am a painter
living and working in North London. I moved from Germany to the UK in
my early 20ies to attend university and whilst there discovered a much deeper way to express
myself, through painting. 
I
knew I had to pursue a career in art when
I met master painter Rosa Branson MBE in late 2009. I didn’t know anything
about drawing or oil painting then, but fortunately Rosa took me on as a
student.Rosa and I (once painted and once in person) at the unveiling of Rosa's painting for Moorfields Eye Hospital.
Over time, Rosa developed enough
faith in me as a painter, not only to mentor me, but also provide me with
accommodation and a studio in her home. She will continue to support me in this
way throughout the whole of my studies at LARA.
Rosa’s encouragement, inspiration
and tough advice have been essential to my journey; so much so that I became a full time painter in 2012. I have never looked back!WHAT HAPPENED SINCE THEN?The last three years have been
great! I’ve learnt so much about painting and life as an artist. I got to copy
at London’s National Gallery and the Kunstpalast in Düsseldorf.Left at the National Gallery in London and right at the Kunstpalast in Düsseldorf. I’ve taken part in exhibitions:2016 The Worlington Movement Spring Exhibition, Bury St Edmunds2015 Hesketh Hubbard Art Society Annual Exhibition, Mall Galleries, London2015 The Worlington Movement Spring Exhibition, Bury St Edmunds2014 The British Red Cross Charity Exhibition and Auction, Japanese Embassy, London W12014 The Worlington Movement Autumn Exhibition, Sable d'Or Muswell Hill, London2014 The Reading Art Exhibition, St Joseph's College, Reading2014 Hesketh Hubbard Art Society Annual Exhibition, Mall Galleries, London2014 The Worlington Movement Spring Exhibition, The Old Fire Station Gallery, Henley-on-Thames2013 The Reading Art Exhibition, St Joseph's College, Reading
I have learned to frame my own paintings, connected with people from all over
the world and made terrific new friends. I remember jumping with joy the first
time I sold a painting to a complete stranger, and the excitement of receiving
my first Mosaic Mural commission.Mosaic Mural on behalf of Paritt Leng Construction and Management Ltd at Bethwin Adventure Playground, Camberwell, London
Now; for the next step: Classical TrainingGoing back to basics in order to reach the next level in my career; to feel whole as a professional painter. LARA's three year, full-time course is exactly what I need to fill my technical gaps and move towards my full potential. That is why I am here; raising £15000 for the first year's tuition and materials, taxes and fees.

WHY SPONSOR ME?
Over the years I have had to take
chances to get where I am now. Through the rough and the smooth, I have always
been blessed with amazing people and the right opportunities to keep on track.
I am hoping that as you get to know me throughout this fundraising campaign,
you will want to be one of these amazing people who take a chance on me.
For just £10 you get access to
exclusive content, sharing with me, my journey to LARA and my time there. I
want YOU to become part of my progress of growth; to see me develop as an
artist.
For higher donations you will
receive artwork, most of it originals – who knows it may be worth a lot one
day!
So stay tuned for more videos
about perks, about me and LARA, interviews with my mentor and previous clients,
and answers to any questions you may have.
Welcome to my journey. Thank you for
joining me!P.S. Where does the money go?The main part of the money raised will cover LARA's tuition fees of £9000/ year, with the rest going towards materials, Indiegogo fees and taxes to HMRC, which will make up another big chunk. Any money left will be put towards year two tuition fees at LARA to get further crowdfunding of to a running start!P.S.S. What about perks?Most of the perks are quite straight forward.

For the next seven years I tracked down the people who knew her and eventually Bettie herself. The culmination was an extensive Page interview in ""The Betty Pages Annual V.2"" and there didn't seem to be anything more to tell on the subject, so I discontinued the title. Bettie's legend continued to grow and her fame reached all corners of the Earth. Even though I stopped writing about her, our relationship continued and we spoke often. Almost all of our conversations were recorded (with her permission) and I have hours of her observations about life and her new-found fame. I also stayed in touch with most of the major players in the story and continued to discover details I'd missed the first time around. Almost thirty years after I started, I'm satisfied that the research is complete and I am about to write my final book on the Queen of Curves. With the death of Harry Lear, her last husband, nothing I write can hurt Bettie and her friends: they have all passed. There are stories that I had discovered while I was publishing ""The Betty Pages"" that I refused to tell and stories I've learned since then that are eye-opening. Since nobody can be hurt, I'm ready to tell the full story. </p>
<p>     It's been some twenty years since I've written about Bettie and also twenty years of her life that has not been reported on. What happened to La Page after she came out of hiding? What was her life like? How did it change her? Who helped her or screwed her over in the end?  It's the other half of the Bettie story that you don't know.</p>
<p>     At least half the book is already written and I estimate that it will take another six months to complete and publish. As I am producing it for my publishing company, Pure Imagination, I am receiving no advance to complete the book. Hence, I'm asking for your help to pay the bills while I complete the project, most importantly paying for the printing. ""Bettie Page: Lost and Found"" will be issued in both deluxe hard and soft-covers and I'd like to issue it in full-color, but that depends on how much the Bettie fans are willing to contribute. If you would like to help me complete Bettie's story, please consider assisting its production.</p>
<p>     Anybody contributing at the $30 level or more will receive a copy of the soft-cover edition whether the goal is met or not and all contributors will receive a signed, limited-edition of the cover. If the goal isn't met, it may take a little longer, but the book is going to be published one way or another. If you can help get the word out I will very much appreciate it.</p>
<p>     The final product will contain dozens of previously unpublished photos, new interviews, and the most complete view of Bettie's life ever published. If you liked my previous work on ""The Tease From Tennessee,"" please consider contributing to what I believe is a worthwhile project that will amuse, amaze, and delight you.</p>

In 1996 Keshia Thomas was attending a protest against the Ku Klux Klan, a white male with an ‘SS tattoo’ and wearing a Confederate flag t-shirt found himself in the midst of the protesters. The man was knocked down and beaten, Keshia shielded the man and stopped the attack.



Photographs of her amazing act of bravery, refusing to meet hate with hate, have made their way around the world spreading inspiration and hope.
Keshia continues to be a voice for what is right. Her heart is to help hope, equality, acceptance, respect, and tranquility to override disparity in the United States. Regardless of what differences of skin, background, opinion, education, or economic status we have, Keshia will continue to use her voice to help right wrongs and to find and embrace balance.
   
What's Next for Keshia?

1) Her Journey

 On August 1, 2015, Keshia will take part in the NAACP's ""America’s Journey for Justice"" – a historic 860-mile march from Selma, Alabama, to Washington, D.C to lobby for change.


This journey will ""mobilize activists and advance a focused national advocacy agenda that protects the right of every American to a fair criminal justice system, uncorrupted and unfettered access to the ballot box, sustainable jobs with a living wage, and equitable public education."" (Source: naacp.org)The walk will end with a rally and advocacy day in Washington, D.C. 
Compelled to participate, Keshia has made a great sacrifice by taking a leave of absence from her job. This sacrifice will cost her income, insurance and stability however, Keshia sees  this all as a small sacrifice in relationship to the great injustices we all still see as American citizens in 2015. Keshia walks as a demonstration of her heart and this journey is the new beginning of her endeavor to serve as an advocate, activist, and advisor on issues affecting humanity.

2) Her H.E.A.R.T.
Educating people in relationship to handling issues surrounding racial intimidation within schools and workplaces. Racial intimidation within primary and secondary education is real, and takes place more often than people realize. When faced with a situation that requires the school staff to respond to racially fueled incidents, there is often a lack of knowledge on how to do so. Keshia plans to offer training on how to effectively handle situations between school staff and students. She will also be able to provide companies with training for those in management, on how to deal with racial intimidation between employee's.


3) Her P.O.I.N.T.

Born in Detroit, Michigan but raised in Ann Arbor, Keshia currently resides in Houston, Texas. With renewed excitement, Keshia is moving back to Detroit in order to be a part of another great renaissance for the city by launching her non-profit organization, P.O.I.N.T. (Purpose. Opportunity. Independence. New Thinking.)


P.O.I.N.T. is an initiative that brings affordable incubator space and resources to the city of Detroit. These resources will help cultivate the  ideas of people into viable small businesses and will help them from the germination phase (idea,) to the vegetation phase (implementation) and finally onto harvesting (independence). These resources are aimed at those who see their dreams as impossible - those who have been afraid to dream as a result of their circumstances. 
P.O.I.N.T. will offer them space for the business to thrive, access to resources to structure the business for success, and mentorship for guidance and growth. The purpose is to create jobs and work towards a self-sufficient economy in the city of Detroit.
What Keshia Needs The vision is great but it can't be fulfilled without support.   $2,500 for America's Journey for Justice to provide Battle Gear: Clothing, shoes, supplies, and sustaining resources for the march (i.e. food, sleeping bags, backpacking supplies, airfare to Alabama and back to Houston, and resources to maintain her housing while marching)  
 $2500 for curriculum development to educate schools and companies on how to correctly deal with  racial intimidation through Keshia's H.E.A.R.T. 

 $5,000 in initial seed money to start the process of launching her non-profit, Keshia's H.E.A.R.T. and the P.O.I.N.T. incubator initiative.

The Impact Keshia's historic picture gained nationwide recognition, and from that platform,  she plans to empower and enlighten young minds, and stand up for solidarity.  She plans to work with those who do not know how to deal racial discrimination situations. Keshia's goal is to bring a fresh voice to address the racially fueled events that have taken place, and to advocate for acceptance and unity.    Risks & Challenges Keshia is leaving her job and taking a leaping of faith. She is stepping out to be a voice to help change the perspective of society.  Keshia is determined to help hope, equality, acceptance, respect, and tranquility override disparity. She entered the public eye by making a selfless decision and sacrificing her own well being to help someone else. Keshia will continue to use her life to advocate for a healthy America void of racial divide. 
Keshia has accepted that there are sacrifices necessary to stand up and advocate for what is right. As many have done before her, Keshia believes that these sacrifices are investments into a better future for those still feeling the unnecessary weights of racial inequality and intimidation.

<p>The 2015 Big Hammock needs some extra love and care. This year we have
made purchases in materials and supplies, such a pole protector bumpers and
signs to keep your children extra safe from any injuries when they are having
BIG fun. These costs to build this 33 feet hammock

<h3>What Is Bedtime Stories?</h3>
<div>
<p><span><i>""Don’t fret my child,</i></span></p>
<p><i>Stay calm as can be. </i></p>
<p><i>Don’t be afraid, </i></p>
<p><i>your fear attracts Boogie.</i></p>
<p><i>Be calm, Be calm, 1, 2, 3</i></p>
<p><i>If you surrender your soul,</i></p>
<i>You cannot ever flee. ""</i><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Bedtime Stories is an environmental installation that simulates what its like inside the mind of someone with an anxiety disorder, through the visual exploration of different versions of the Boogie Monster myth. It's a walk through experience, like a haunted house, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">that shows the world of two sister’s bedroom that has become possessed by the Boogie Monster. </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div> </div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;""> Welcome To My Head (Inspiration and Background)</h3>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">The inspiration for Bedtime Stories came from a series of weird storytelling games I created to cope with my peaking anxiety disorder my freshmen year of college. At the time, I had not been diagnosed or treated, nor did I have an idea of what I was dealing with. What I did know, though not really understood, was what I was experiencing. So, I channeled my inner child to help make sense of it all. As a young adult, I didn't know how to conquer my overwhelmed mind, but as a child I did know how to conquer the monsters in my closet and under my bed. So, perhaps I could conquer my grown monsters just the same. I assigned faces, figures, and names to the horrors that kept me locked in my room and in my head, and I made myself the heroine of my own stories.  I allowed the rooms around me to become part of this children's storytelling game, because if I made the rules, I knew how to win the game, I knew how to make it through the spaces that had previously overwhelmed and held me back. So, when I started brainstorming for my capstone, the idea of taking these experiences and allowing others to be part of them, to perhaps come to an understanding of one persons fantastical perspective of a very real problem led to the development of Bedtime Stories.</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">This installation is meant to be an exciting and unique experience, but also a very stylized glimpse into one persons experience with anxiety disorder. I don't, nor can I, propose a solution to fixing this growing and often ignored problem in our society, but I can share whats inside my head, in hopes of creating, at least some, insight.</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">Bedtime Stories will be exhibited to the public in early May. </div>

</div></div>","What Is Bedtime Stories?

""Don’t fret my child,
Stay calm as can be. 
Don’t be afraid, 
your fear attracts Boogie.
Be calm, Be calm, 1, 2, 3
If you surrender your soul,
You cannot ever flee. ""


Bedtime Stories is an environmental installation that simulates what its like inside the mind of someone with an anxiety disorder, through the visual exploration of different versions of the Boogie Monster myth. It's a walk through experience, like a haunted house, that shows the world of two sister’s bedroom that has become possessed by the Boogie Monster. 

    Welcome To My Head (Inspiration and Background)
The inspiration for Bedtime Stories came from a series of weird storytelling games I created to cope with my peaking anxiety disorder my freshmen year of college. At the time, I had not been diagnosed or treated, nor did I have an idea of what I was dealing with. What I did know, though not really understood, was what I was experiencing. So, I channeled my inner child to help make sense of it all. As a young adult, I didn't know how to conquer my overwhelmed mind, but as a child I did know how to conquer the monsters in my closet and under my bed. So, perhaps I could conquer my grown monsters just the same. I assigned faces, figures, and names to the horrors that kept me locked in my room and in my head, and I made myself the heroine of my own stories.  I allowed the rooms around me to become part of this children's storytelling game, because if I made the rules, I knew how to win the game, I knew how to make it through the spaces that had previously overwhelmed and held me back. So, when I started brainstorming for my capstone, the idea of taking these experiences and allowing others to be part of them, to perhaps come to an understanding of one persons fantastical perspective of a very real problem led to the development of Bedtime Stories.

This installation is meant to be an exciting and unique experience, but also a very stylized glimpse into one persons experience with anxiety disorder. I don't, nor can I, propose a solution to fixing this growing and often ignored problem in our society, but I can share whats inside my head, in hopes of creating, at least some, insight.

Bedtime Stories will be exhibited to the public in early May.

Who's Head Are We Entering? 
Hello, I'm Alejandra Gama, a senior Theatre student at Arizona State University. I will be receiving my BA this coming May. Throughout my college career I have had the joy of working in various disciplines on different productions. My previous work includes scenic design for It's Not That Simple (ASU Applied Project), Dog Sees God (Phoenix Center for the Arts), Bug (BTC), Finger Painting For Grown-Ups (BTC), Drowning. But Not Falling (BTC), prop mastering  for Germs and Viruses: Or the Syrian Spring (ASU Mainstage) and Brooklyn Bridge (ASU Mainstage) and costume design for Women of War (BTC) and Necrosis (BTC). I am the current Scenic Design Representative for Binary Theater Company. I've also had the pleasure to exhibit my multimedia sculpture ""In Commemoration of a Little Bird: A Visual Eulogy"" at Emerge 2014: The Carnival of the Future.
My career aspirations are to become an environmental installation artists, blending all my previous work in various disciplines into one experience.   
While this project is a focus on my fears, it is with great excitement that I push to bring to fruition this multimedia experience, with my wonderful and unique team.

</h3>Greetings, and thank you for checking out my funding page! <br/><br/>My name is Kyle, and 5 years ago I created a Mega Man rage-stick (totem, sign, etc.).

<p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p><b>Essentials</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We are fundraising for an exhibition of young Syrian artists telling the stories of Syria through their work</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The exhibition will take place in London in 2016</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Medium: Painting, Sculpture,
Photography, Digital Work, Film, Video and Installation</p>
<p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p><b>About Me</b></p>
<p>My name is Rami Yazje. I’m a civil engineer by training and have worked in
business consulting in the UAE and the UK. </p>
<p>I was working in London when the economic downturn hit and I was laid off. I moved back to Syria at the end of 2009 to launch my painting
career (I paint large abstracts in the style of abstract expressionism). As the country disintegrated, I made the difficult choice to leave in early 2015. I
relocated to Istanbul, Turkey, where I am now based.</p><p>I met many interesting artists during my time in Syria but due to the obvious difficulties faced by everyone in the country at the moment, there is little infrastructure for exhibition or to maintain a vibrant contemporary art scene. Knowing that I would be relocating to London in 2016, I began to think about how I could showcase the work of young Syrian artists who, through their work, are telling the untold stories of life and the strange reality of Syria today.</p><p>Art has always been a passion of mine and the overall plan is to open a gallery in London, exhibiting work and representing artists. New Art from Syria will be the first exhibition I will stage in London and will mark the beginning of a whole new series of exhibitions and projects both in the UK and worldwide!</p>

</span>More exposure. Bigger chance of taking

<p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p><b>What the Exhibition is about?</b></p>
<p>The exhibition will tell stories from Syria through the work of emerging contemporary Syrian artists. A ‘Picture’ will emerge of
a country ravaged by war, apocalyptic scenes of death and destruction, corrupt politics,
evil ideologies and human suffering on an astronomical scale. The artists will
have complete freedom within the exhibition and its context within London to express themselves. Artistic insights challenge the way we see stories reported by the media and also record this key moment in time. We don't know what will happen for Syria but it's so important to witness, express, create and record!</p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">The Campaign</b><br/></p>
<p>I have been researching and planning this exhibition project since late 2014. I have been contacting artists and receiving many positive responses. There are so many talented young and emerging artists based in and out of Syria that are interested in participating and showing their work.

The Garden- V. Sackville-WestConflicting Realities: New Art from Syria 
Essentials
· 
We are fundraising for an exhibition of young Syrian artists telling the stories of Syria through their work
· 
The exhibition will take place in London in 2016
· 
Medium: Painting, Sculpture,
Photography, Digital Work, Film, Video and Installation
About Me
My name is Rami Yazje. I’m a civil engineer by training and have worked in
business consulting in the UAE and the UK. 
I was working in London when the economic downturn hit and I was laid off. I moved back to Syria at the end of 2009 to launch my painting
career (I paint large abstracts in the style of abstract expressionism). As the country disintegrated, I made the difficult choice to leave in early 2015. I
relocated to Istanbul, Turkey, where I am now based.I met many interesting artists during my time in Syria but due to the obvious difficulties faced by everyone in the country at the moment, there is little infrastructure for exhibition or to maintain a vibrant contemporary art scene. Knowing that I would be relocating to London in 2016, I began to think about how I could showcase the work of young Syrian artists who, through their work, are telling the untold stories of life and the strange reality of Syria today.Art has always been a passion of mine and the overall plan is to open a gallery in London, exhibiting work and representing artists. New Art from Syria will be the first exhibition I will stage in London and will mark the beginning of a whole new series of exhibitions and projects both in the UK and worldwide!

Link to my Saatchi Artist Profilehttp://www.saatchiart.com/ramiWhy London?
· 
Vibrant art scene and market
· 
Stable political and economic climate
· 
Freedom of expression...
· 
More exposure. Bigger chance of taking
the exhibition on the road afterwards!
What the Exhibition is about?
The exhibition will tell stories from Syria through the work of emerging contemporary Syrian artists. A ‘Picture’ will emerge of
a country ravaged by war, apocalyptic scenes of death and destruction, corrupt politics,
evil ideologies and human suffering on an astronomical scale. The artists will
have complete freedom within the exhibition and its context within London to express themselves. Artistic insights challenge the way we see stories reported by the media and also record this key moment in time. We don't know what will happen for Syria but it's so important to witness, express, create and record!The Campaign
I have been researching and planning this exhibition project since late 2014. I have been contacting artists and receiving many positive responses. There are so many talented young and emerging artists based in and out of Syria that are interested in participating and showing their work. A project like this, however, needs funds to make it happen and I soon realised the funds I currently have do not match the scope and scale of the exhibition I would like to do. If I'm going to do it, i want to do it right and do justice to the artists involved! Money donated to
this campaign will be used most conscientiously to serve one aspiration: to
create an exhibition that will change perspectives, create opportunity, change lives and, hopefully for the future, go some way towards easing the suffering of Syrians everywhere..So this is how the money will be spent
·  $25,000: Hire of large, visible and well-known exhibition space in London/Dedicated exhibition staff and technicians/Fixtures and fittings
·  $15,000: Shipping of artworks from all over the world
·  $15,000: Marketing/Website/Publication/Promotional Material
·  $10,000: Funding of independent projects/new commissions and collatoral programme as part of the Exhibition
·  $11,000: Perks (We have some great perks - check them out!)

A seguito di un periodo di ricerca presso Townhouse Gallery al Cairo, il progetto prenderà corpo “on the road” lungo la strada costiera che connette Suez al confine Sudanese, con l'obbiettivo di documentare il cambiamento e le trasformazioni in atto lungo la costa del MarRosso.L'Egitto ha stanziato 150 miliardi di dollari per investimentiimmobiliari, molti dei quali si svilupperanno lungo costa desertica.Utilizzando la linea di confine tra deserto e acqua come metafora degli opposti, intendo concentrarmi sullo sviluppo dei nuovi centri urbani nel deserto,sull'innovazione architettonica contrapposta alla tradizione locale e sui cambiamenti morfologici in atto in un paesaggio consolidato.Durante la residenza organizzerò delle Open Talk presso Townhouse invitando artisti e architetti per riflettere sul concetto di paesaggio; le Talk saranno aperte al pubblico e sarà un modo per coinvolgere la comunità e le istituzioni locali.La documentazione del paesaggio, sia esso naturale o antropico, èinnanzitutto un fatto etico ancor prima che cognitivo; è la necessità di essere testimoni del presente, prendersi cura del proprio tempo.Changing Landscape intende testimoniare un “ciclo di vita” di un paesaggio che si trasforma ogni giorno; un momento di transizione per luoghi destinati a profonde trasformazioni, scenari che già non esistono più.SU DI MEIl mio nome è Barbara Rossi.Sono cresciuta su un camper e fin da ragazzina la fotografia è stata un modo per mappare il mondo intorno a me e ricordare i luoghi.Oggi la mia ricerca è basata sull'osservazione e sull'analisi delle relazioni tra uomo, territorio e tempo.Vedo nel mezzo fotografico uno strumento sopraffino per comprendere situazioni, per cogliere il passaggio tra modernità e postmodernità riflesso nell'ambiente in cui vivo.Materiali della mia ricerca sono i segni lasciato dall'uomo sul paesaggio e sul tempo, come l'architettura o le grandi opere stradali (oggetti che esprimono la sua relazione con il tempo in cui vive).Potete vivistare il mio portfolio al link seguente http://barbara-rossi.tumblr.com/e uno dei miei ultimi porgetti al link seguentehttp://www.domusweb.it/it/portfolio/2015/04/07/barbara_rossi_ss9_inventario_della_via_emilia.htmlContribuendo al progetto potrete avere una stampa fotografica del progetto, oppure qualcosa che voi sceglierete dal mio portfolio.Se non potete contribuire economicamente, fate girare il progetto, condividetelo e parlatene ai vostri amici!

<p>Pitch...:</p>
<p> 'BIG NOTHING/ Das Projekt zur Fülle im 
NICHTS' is an evolving Conscious Art work growing out of my personal 
experience with a knockout after a stage accident and my subsequent 
somatic research on the 'matter' of NOTHINGNESS. BIG NOTHING is a book 
project, a new Coaching method as well as its concept embraces various 
kinds of future performative installations on NOTHINGNESS and a film. 
All in all BIG NOTHING is a bold political statement questioning the mental
 patterns established by our achievement-oriented society and 
sensitizing a wider audience to the riches within NOTHINGNESS from the 
moment we let go of fear and make a leap to our very personal - and at 
the same time collective - 'Self'. In this sense BIG NOTHING in the end is NOTHING more and NOTHING less than just a new and other way to BE.'</p>

Helfe mit, dass diese Fülle-im-NICHTS-Erfahrung durch BIG NOTHING zu einer kollektiven Welle wird. Aus der Fülle-Erfahrung jedes einzelnen Schenkenden heraus kann BIG NOTHING als Conscious Art Werk immer weiterwachsen - bis die subjektive und kollektive Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS letztlich das konkrete KUNSTWERK ist.

<div style=""color:#525151 ;"">Project description in English<br/><h3 style=""color:#525151 ;"">1. Welcome
to BIG NOTHING! </h3>
<p>Have you ever
spent money for NOTHING? ...</p>
<p>If so, this
project is YOUR chance (and maybe our shared blessing) if you charmingly do it
again! </p>
<p>However, this
time, you are invited to invest in NOTHING in your right mind and with your
fullest awareness – so that you are open enough to RECEIVE the fullest of the
hidden riches ‘NOTHINGNESS’ has on offer – for your heart, your soul, your
health, your life - when ‘giving’! :)</p>
<p>With the
support of this project, you are given the unique opportunity and platform, to
experiment with the nature of NOTHINGNESS by consciously investing in NOTHING, i.e. in
the ‘Non-Space’, in ‘The Big Void’, in ‘the gap’, in ‘the silence’…  – and
as such to make an entirely new experience with what we usually are trying to
avoid: the confrontation with NOTHING...</p>
<p>Maybe
investing in NOTHING or being confronted with NOTHING sometimes feels a bit like
facing death? At least, ‘Big Void’ does ask for courage, sometimes even for
audacity – and definitely for the relaxation of ‘logic brain’. And many people
shy away from BIG NOTHING and ‘hide’ in what they call ‘real’. I would say,
within our ‘logic brain’ and profit-oriented culture it is definitely an act of
subversion to dare and face BIG NOTHING – let alone to invest in it! :)</p>
<p>So welcome to
both - the subversive and the loving side in you! Get your 'guts' together -
and dare to spend your money here - on NOTHING! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>2. About BIG NOTHING<br/>
</h3>
<p>The BIG
NOTHING project seeks from its very start to stimulate in a very playful and
experimental way the idea and insight in you that NOTHING - or NOTHINGNESS - is
never nothing. On the contrary. BIG NOTHING is always full. Full of sheer
abundance, options, love and joy - ready to materialise, as long as you remain
open and courageous enough to keep engaged with those hidden riches and
creative powers such ‘silent unknown’ has on offer. To invest in BIG NOTHING
could mean that you might experience NOTHING at first, but maybe loads in a
longer run. It may also mean that you are asked to transform your time-based/
logic brain mentality into a more ‘magnetic’ one…  And here’s the point
where meditation or my DACA technique and Coaching may be of help... (s. Perks) <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>3. Purpose
&amp; Experience</h3>
<p>The feeling
of happiness, bliss and love that you might experience when investing your
money here and now in NOTHING – while expecting NOTHING - is the magic power of
NOTHINGNESS and thus not only the project’s research topic, but also its
highest goal and nature. The miracles or synchronicities you might eventually
start to experience when consciously spending money on our shared BIG NOTHING
belong to the realm of what I call ‘magnetic power’ or ‘somatic-feminine
quality’ which I view as the counterpart to the ‘analytical-masculine quality’
or ‘logic brain’.</p>
<p>If you would
like to find out more about my research in the ‘somatic-feminine’, you are very
welcome to visit my new blog <a href=""https://bloggingfeminine.wordpress.com/blogging-feminine"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> <span style=""color:#c82055;"">https://bloggingfeminine.wordpress.com/blogging-feminine</span></a> or my artwork in film
and theatre (s. info below) or you join me in a healing/ coaching session,
Meditation or Yoga class (s. Perks and Meditation/ Yoga classes updates on FB
&amp; <a href=""http://www.potentialcoaching.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> <span style=""color:#c82055;"">www.potentialcoaching.de</span></a>). :)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>4. BIG
NOTHING's very nature</h3>
<p>Now: the more
people we are here, on this very platform, who are brave enough to subversively
invest big and small sums of money in NOTHING - and who make a NOTHINGNESS experience at the same time, the more abundant and powerful
the BIG NOTHING project’s result will be in the end! And watch the traces life
embraces – when you let BIG NOTHING ‘speak’. ;)</p>
<p>The more
people supporting this project, the bigger and more ground-breaking the BIG
NOTHING’s output and effect as an art project and ‘life-transformer’ will be.
That’s the very nature of this project. NOTHING more. <br/></p>
<p>Maybe there
will be (amongst many other things) a finished film coming out of BIG NOTHING,
or a book, or a healing art installation reflecting on my and your NOTHINGNESS experiences. Or maybe you’ll meet your NOTHINGNESS on
my personal BIG NOTHING island and research place Ikaria. Whichever. The biggest reward when investing in
NOTHING is the experience of NOTHINGNESS in itself – the experience of its
‘talking’, of its wisdom, its creative powers, which are being unlocked in the
moment you dare to know NOTHING, to expect NOTHING, to plan NOTHING. In such
moments you are free – you feel expanded. You may even feel love. Maybe this project allows you to flow
with such momentum and experience of freedom and expansion a tiny little bit longer,
letting you taste its smell. At least that’s what I experienced after I had to
face BIG NOTHING for months due to a stage accident… And in bringing now the
fruits of such experience into the world and to you personally, fills me up
with a very deep happiness and joy. </p>
<p>I thank you
so much for joining in – and play the ‘game’ with me! :)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>5. About the
Perks</h3>
<p>If you look
at the NOTHINGNESS Perks to your right, you’ll find out what kind of investment suits you
best to make BIG NOTHING work – for yourself and as a collective experience.
And from the very moment you make your investment, this project starts to
blossom. That’s the beauty of it. It exists as soon as YOU start it. Please
make it big! And please, spread the words! BE the proof that BIG NOTHING is not
nothing, but EVERTHING beyond love!</p>
<p>When choosing
your Perk (i.e. your investing amount and your specific version of playing the
BIG NOTHING ‘game’/experiment), you have the choice to either make an
investment into ‘plain NOTHINGNESS’ or to invest in a guided version within the
BIG NOTHING experience.</p>
<p>Whichever you
choose, I’m so happy and grateful that you join this subversive experiment and
game, which hopefully brings up lots of magic and abundant personal and
collective experience – and helps many of you finding back to love, bliss and
joy. And please do not use too much ‘logic brain’ when you read this and start
acting along this suggested scheme! ;)</p>
<p>Thank you so
much for your courage, audacity, love &amp; support. You ARE amazing! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>6. How BIG
NOTHING came to birth...</h3>
<p>A stage
accident on August 21<sup>st</sup> 2014 injured not only my head, but also my
day-to-day functioning and identity up to that very day. From one moment to the
next, I hit bottom and I was forced to keep completely still. It kind of felt
like an ‘order of life’, so to speak. I could do NOTHING about it. I could do
NOTHING for it, nor against it. It didn’t help when I moaned, it didn’t help
when I planned nor when I made some prognoses about the speed of my healing.
All I had to learn from that moment onwards was to dare facing NOTHING and
rejoicing its stillness – and eventually its magic.</p>
<p>As an actress
(director and coach) I had also been working self-employed. And for the
performance on that very night I was not insured - as it turned out along the
unfolding of the accident’s repercussions... Thus, to me in this very
situation, hitting bottom and facing NOTHING did not only mean stopping the
‘Doing’, but also stopping earning money by means of ‘Doing’. And that to me
felt at first really scary... </p>
<p>For a long
time it looked like I was losing everything. No longer being able to resolve my
situation by acts of ‘Doing’ was something I felt very foreign to and which
thus created so much fear in the beginning of such NOTHINGNESS 'process'. Bound
to the sickbed, I felt there was NOTHING I could actively do to save myself.
However, there I still was - and there I still am. And in such experience of
BIG NOTHING, I came to taste the fruits of surrender, the fruits of BEING as a
HUMAN BEING - in moments we manage to rid ourselves of the fear we picked up on and internalized through social conditioning and past traumatic experience... </p>
<p>I now know
that NOTHING is never NOTHING, but EVERYTHING you are asking for. </p>
<p>And it’s been
so much I gained since I learnt to let BIG NOTHING do the ‘work’.</p>
<p>I had been a
Meditation and Yoga practitioner for over 20 years before the accident, but it
was only some months after the accident when I started to access and receive
the NOTHINGNESS’ fullest bliss. </p>
<p>From the
moment I embraced the fact that there was NOTHING I could do other than to
surrender, the situation (at least inside myself) turned round and I started
hitting heights. All the sudden – and more and more often – I felt at complete
ease with the situation I was in, despite the physical pain and the subsequent
emotional condition and turbulence that still kept occurring. All the sudden a
feeling of deep happiness and abundance that was no longer related to the
concrete circumstances of my sickbed situation entered my life. And such
experience was quite something.</p>
<p>Because, it
made me understand that NOTHING is not NOTHING, but EVERYTHING embracing love,
joy, opportunities and happiness – if we do dare to enter a dialogue with the
‘BIG VOID’. </p>
<p>This
experience changed my life for ever and let me understand the nature of healing
and ‘magnetic power’ to a greater depth.</p>
<p>It also became my artistic research topic so to speak.<br/></p>
<p>And that is now what I would love to share with you with BIG NOTHING: turning my personal experience into a (healing) (community) art
project…</p>
<br/>
<h3>7. THE BIG
NOTHING's Summery </h3>
<p>The BIG
NOTHING….</p>
<p>… is an art
project encouraging its investors and audience to enter a shared experience
with NOTHINGNESS and opening up for individual &amp; experience-based proof
that NOTHING is NOT NOTHING, but EVERYTHING beyond love – in the moment when we
allow ourselves to shift focus from ‘logic’ brain to ‘somatic’ brain.</p>
<p>… is – at its
very beginning - an art project in which the project investors are at the same
time the project's receivers/ audience.</p>
<p>… is an art
project which comes to life as soon as its investors and receivers start
investing money in BIG NOTHING.</p>
<p>… is an art
project which scale and extent is dependent on its investors/ audience degree
of subversiveness and ‘appetite’ to spend money for/ in NOTHING.</p>
<p>… is a
process-oriented experiment with the ‘Non-Space’ (the ‘Big Void’) which has no
concrete intent regarding its final outcome. There might be a film, a book or
live Performance Acts arising out of the project and the experience with BIG
NOTHING. However, the projects emphasis does not lay on a previously defined
final product, but on the process itself, the shared experience and the
questions it triggers.</p>

<p>Projektbeschreibung auf Deutsch</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>1. Die Fülle im NICHTS: Projektbeschreibung </h3>
<p><b>1.1. Das NICHTS &amp; die FÜLLE</b></p>
<p>Einmal mehr für ‚Nichts‘ Geld ausgeben! 
Das ist das Projekt. Nur dieses eine Mal ganz bewusst - und dabei FÜLLE erleben! Wie geht denn das?! :)</p>
<p>Mit der Unterstützung dieses Projekts bekommst
Du die Möglichkeit und Plattform geschenkt, eine neue Erfahrung/ ein Experiment
mit dem NICHTS zu machen. </p>
<p>Das Projekt dient - schon im Prozess seiner
Entstehung - als Spielfläche der Erkenntnis, dass das NICHTS nie nichts ist,
sondern immer auch ein Vakuum schierer Fülle und Liebe beinhaltet - also
letztendlich reines 'Lebenselixier' ist ... solange Du Dich auf diese Qualität,
d.h. die im NICHTS geborgene Schaffens- und Kreativkraft einlässt und Du
'subversiv' genug bist, einmal für länger NICHTS zu erleben und/ oder Dein Geld
einfach einmal bewusst ins NICHTS zu investieren. Kommt dann wirklich NICHTS
zurück? <br/></p>
<p>Deine Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS ist Inhalt des Projekts!</p>
<p><b>1.2. Das NICHTS als Momentum </b></p>
<p>In diesem Projekt, welches das NICHTS zum Thema macht, steht die im NICHTS (oder in der 'Lücke') erlebbare FÜLLE im Zentrum. Das
Glücksgefühl, welches Du (von mir begleitet oder nicht) durch Deine Investition
ins NICHTS (s. Perks rechts) womöglich erleben wirst, ist der höchste Sinn
dieses Projekts - welches sich ferner auch mit der im NICHTS verankerten
'weiblich-somatischen'/ 'magnetischen' Kreativkraft (als Gegenpol zur
'männlich-analytischen' Kreativkraft) auseinandersetzt. Ein Themenkreis,
welcher mich seit meinem Bühnenunfall am 21. August 2014 künstlerisch
intensiver beschäftigt (s. auch <a href=""https://bloggingfeminine.wordpress.com/blogging-feminine%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""color:#525151 ;"">https://bloggingfeminine.wordpress.com/blogging-feminine)</span> </a> - und aus welchem vielleicht einmal ein Film entsteht und/ oder ein Buch. </p>
<p>Je mehr Menschen JETZT für dieses Projekt mit
grossen und mit kleinen Summen ganz subversiv ins NICHTS investieren - desto
kraftvoller wird die damit erzeugte Fülle sein. Und nach und nach wird diese
Fülle auch äusserlich sicht- und erlebbar werden. In Deinem Leben wie in
meinem. Wenn wir uns dafür öffnen. Lasst uns also diesen Moment gemeinsam
kreieren! :) <br/></p>
<p><b>1.3. Deine persönliche Erfahrung mit dem
NICHTS als Teil des Gesamtwerks</b></p>
<p>Kommt eine grosse, mutige Masse an NICHTS
Investititionen hier bei diesem Crowdfunding (und hoffentlich bald auch auf einer eigenen Webseite) zusammen, steht am Ende
tatsächlich auch ein künstlerisches Werk. Doch dieses Werk, bzw. ein im Vorfeld
anvisiertes und definiertes Endprodukt, ist nicht das erste Ziel dieses
Projekts. Das Ziel ist Eure/ Deine individuelle (und damit auch kollektive)
Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS und das Erleben, dass das eigentlich Gewinnbringende
am Investieren ins NICHTS das NICHTS selber ist - die Erfahrung seiner
Schöpfungs-Potenz. Und diese Schöpfungspotenz und Kreativkraft erschliesst sich
erst über unseren aller Mut, NICHTS zu wissen, NICHTS zu erwarten, NICHTS zu
planen, wenn wir ins NICHTS investieren. Im NICHTS begegnen wir dem SELBST. Und nur wenn wir das NICHTS wirklich an
uns heran lassen und es aushalten, kann es seine Kraft und Liebe erschliessen
und ein Tor sein zu unserem persönlichen Glück. Und dieses Glück, das durch
Deine/ Eure Investition ins NICHTS entsteht, wünsche ich Dir und Euch von
Herzen.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>2. Die Perks: </h3>
<h3>Eure Investition - Euer Vertrauen ins NICHTS! </h3>
<p>Schaut gerne bei den Perks (rechts aussen), wie
Ihr das NICHTS mit mir zusammen in Schwingung bringen könnt. Von dem Moment an,
an dem Ihr hier mutig und mit Spiellust ins NICHTS investiert, fängt dieses
Projekt an zu erblühen. Und jeder Betrag, jede einzelne Erfahrung von und mit
Euch wird ein Beitrag dieser aus dem NICHTS entspringenden und kollektiv
erlebbaren Fülle sein. <br/>
Die Perks überlassen Euch die Wahl, ob Ihr bei der Investition ins NICHTS meine
Begleitung wünscht - oder ob Ihr restlos frei von jeglicher Absicht und
Prognose ins stille NICHTS zu investieren wagt.<br/>
Vom schieren Investieren ins reine NICHTS, bis zu kurzen oder längeren
begleiteten Sessions im 'Nicht-Raum' (über Telefon-Skype-Viber, im Yogaraum
oder an Naturplätzen Ikarias) ist alles möglich. Ich freue mich auf die Begegnung mit Euch im NICHTS auf Ikaria und auch anderswo. Und über die Ergebnisse meiner künstlerischen Erforschung des NICHTS halte ich Euch ebenfalls gerne auf dem Laufenden.<br/></p>
<p>Für welche Art NICHTS-Investition Ihr Euch auch
immer entscheidet, ich freue mich auf dieses Spiel, dieses Experiment mit Euch
- Eure Liebe, Eure 'Subversivität' und Euren MUT!! </p>
<p>Ihr seid grandios! Danke! Und hoch lebe sie, die Fülle im NICHTS, die Fülle in der 'Lücke' - inmitten unserer durchorganisierten Leistungskultur!<br/></p>
<br/>
<h3>3. Hintergrund/ Entstehung der Projektidee </h3>
<p>Ein Bühnenunfall am 21.August 2014 riss mich als
Schauspielerin (Regisseurin &amp; Potential Coach) jäh aus meinem bisherigen
Leben und ich lernte zwangsläufig (doch endlich!) von heute auf morgen das
Still-Liegen und Verweilen - das 'NICHTS tun', das 'NICHTS wollen', das
'Aufgeben', das 'Hingeben' kennen. </p>
<p>Ich praktizierte schon viele
Jahre vor dem Unfall Meditation und Yoga. Doch nach dem Unfall erst lernte und
lerne ich in aller Konsequenz, was es heisst, 'nur' zu SEIN, bzw.
'Mit-dem-NICHTS-sein'. </p>
<p>Und in diesem SEIN, in diesem erlebten IM NICHTS
SEIN, packte mich und entdeckte ich dann mit einem Mal diese schiere Fülle -
erlebte ich die Potenz des stillen Seins - die Potenz des NICHTS: das gefühlte
schiere Glück! Und Magie - bzw. der 'magnetische' Raum - fing an mit mir zu
sprechen... </p>
<p>Auch wenn vieles in dieser Zeit nach dem Unfall
sehr schlimm war und mich neben den Schmerzen auch die Angst immer wieder
packte (als selbständige Künstlerin war ich zum Beispiel bezüglich dem Unfall
und seinen Folgen nicht abgesichert...), hat mich diese spezifische Stille- und
Glücks-Erfahrung so sehr überrascht; hat sie meine Kapazitäten (als Künstlerin,
als Mensch und in der Heilung) so sehr verstärkt, dass das 'stille NICHTS'
mittlerweile wie von selbst das neue Selbstverständnis meiner Kunst und Arbeit
geworden ist - und eine Erfahrung, die ich gerne über meine künstlerische
Arbeit hinaus mit Euch teilen möchte. Deshalb BIG NOTHING als Projekt, von dem
ich hoffe, dass es 'unser gemeinsames' wird!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>4. BIG NOTHING &amp; die westlich geprägte
Leistungs- und Konsumkultur</h3>
<p>Der Blick auf die westliche, dem TUN &amp; HABEN
verpflichtete Gesellschaft lässt mich vermuten, dass eine Investition ins
NICHTS mittlerweile der subversivste persönliche, gesellschaftliche, politische
und künstlerische Akt ist, den wir - als von uns SELBST entfremdete HUMAN
DOINGS - im 'Rasen der Zeit' und im Kontext unserer Gier nach immer mehr -
überhaupt noch vollziehen können.</p>
<p>Und nur in diesem subversivsten Akt einer
Investition ins NICHTS, bzw. in die tiefste innere Stille der Dinge hinein,
sehe ich noch eine Möglichkeit, dass wir westlich geprägten Menschen vielleicht
doch noch irgendwann wieder vom HUMAN DOING zurück zu unserem eigentlichen
Wesen als HUMAN BEING finden - und die Erde sich vielleicht mit uns doch noch
versöhnt - und uns weiter nährt. </p>
<p>Es liegt an uns. Der Reichtum ist da. Und
spielend lässt er sich besonders gern erschliessen. Lasst es uns versuchen! JETZT! :) <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>4. Zusammenfassung: </h3>
<h3>Das Grosse (stille) NICHTSPROJEKT… </h3>
<p>... ist ein Kunstprojekt zur Erfahung des
NICHTS, des 'stillen Seins', des NICHT-MEHR-TUNS und jener Fülle und Kraft, die
wir erleben können, in Momenten, in denen wir jegliche Erwartung, Vorstellung
und Bewertung losgelassen haben...<br/>
<br/>
... ist ein Kunstprojekt, welches Künstler und Investoren, die gleichzeitig
auch die Rezipienten (das Publikum) des Projekts sind, von Anfang an in eine
gleichgestellte Beziehung setzt und in welchem sowohl Künstler als auch das
investierende Publikum/ Rezipient Geben und Nehmen in einer Balance erleben
können - bzw. alle am Projekt Beteiligtenden gemeinsam eine sowohl individuelle
als auch kollektive Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS (dem 'Nicht-Raum') machen.</p>
<p>... ist ein Experiment mit dem NICHT-Raum, an
dessen Anfang lediglich eine vage und offene Vorstellung von einem möglichen
künstlerischen 'Endprodukt' (ein Film, ein Buch, live Performance Acts zum
'stillen Nichts', etc.) steht, welche jedoch für das Projekt selber nicht
ausschlaggebend ist - weil es sich erst noch kristallisieren wird, welches
Endergebnis aus dem NICHT-Raum der sich an diesem Projekt beteiligenden,
investierenden Menschen hervorgehen wird. Eure Investitionen und Erlebnisse
sind es also, die das Projekt in seiner Fülle und seinem Ausdruck definieren.
Und je mehr Menschen ins NICHTS zu investieren wagen, umso grösser wird die
WELLE an Erleben und Fülle sein, die letztendlich - natürlich - auch auch einen
künstlerischen Ausdruck findet.  :)</p>
<p>... ist eine Art 'Public Art Projekt', bei dem
Du schon in der Phase der Finanzierung eingeladen bist, die konkrete
inhaltliche Erfahung mit dem Nicht-Raum (bzw. der 'weiblich-somatischen'/
'magnetischen' Qualität) zu machen. (s. Perks)</p>

Welcome
to BIG NOTHING - Das Projekt zur Fülle im NICHTS! 



Pitch...:
 'BIG NOTHING/ Das Projekt zur Fülle im 
NICHTS' is an evolving Conscious Art work growing out of my personal 
experience with a knockout after a stage accident and my subsequent 
somatic research on the 'matter' of NOTHINGNESS. BIG NOTHING is a book 
project, a new Coaching method as well as its concept embraces various 
kinds of future performative installations on NOTHINGNESS and a film. 
All in all BIG NOTHING is a bold political statement questioning the mental
 patterns established by our achievement-oriented society and 
sensitizing a wider audience to the riches within NOTHINGNESS from the 
moment we let go of fear and make a leap to our very personal - and at 
the same time collective - 'Self'. In this sense BIG NOTHING in the end is NOTHING more and NOTHING less than just a new and other way to BE.'
 (Simone Leona Hueber)
Vorwort auf Deutsch:
'BIG
NOTHING/ Das Projekt zur Fülle im NICHTS' in seiner derzeitigen
Entwicklungsphase, wie als späteres Buch-/ Filmprojekt möchte einen erfahrbaren
Raum schaffen, in dem die Fuelle von NICHTS-Momenten und deren Magie vom
Rezipienten als (heilsame) Realitaet wahrgenommen und damit erlernt werden
kann...' (Simone Leona Hueber) 
Am 8.März 2016 ging BIG NOTHING/ Das Grosse NICHTS Projekt auf Indiegogo
 das erste Mal 60 Tage lang online und erste mutige NICHTS-Investoren 
haben 2'000 $ grosszügig in (die Fülle de)s NICHTS investiert. 
Besonders beliebt sind dabei die Coaching Perks zu Eurer rechten Seite. Und Ikaria als NICHTS-Insel zieht jetzt weitere NICHTS-ErgründerInnen an... BIG NOTHING handelt von der Fülle im NICHTS! Investiere/ schenke auch Du ins NICHTS, das (gemäss jüngsten wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen - wie z.B. jenen von Stephen Hawkings) eben nicht nichts, sondern die schiere Fülle ist. Helfe mit, dass diese Fülle-im-NICHTS-Erfahrung durch BIG NOTHING zu einer kollektiven Welle wird. Aus der Fülle-Erfahrung jedes einzelnen Schenkenden heraus kann BIG NOTHING als Conscious Art Werk immer weiterwachsen - bis die subjektive und kollektive Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS letztlich das konkrete KUNSTWERK ist. Mache Du diese schöne Welle möglich! Investiere jetzt ganz kühn ins JETZT! Und das Buch zum NICHTS wird folgen.

Project description in English1. Welcome
to BIG NOTHING! 
Have you ever
spent money for NOTHING? ...
If so, this
project is YOUR chance (and maybe our shared blessing) if you charmingly do it
again! 
However, this
time, you are invited to invest in NOTHING in your right mind and with your
fullest awareness – so that you are open enough to RECEIVE the fullest of the
hidden riches ‘NOTHINGNESS’ has on offer – for your heart, your soul, your
health, your life - when ‘giving’! :)
With the
support of this project, you are given the unique opportunity and platform, to
experiment with the nature of NOTHINGNESS by consciously investing in NOTHING, i.e. in
the ‘Non-Space’, in ‘The Big Void’, in ‘the gap’, in ‘the silence’…  – and
as such to make an entirely new experience with what we usually are trying to
avoid: the confrontation with NOTHING...
Maybe
investing in NOTHING or being confronted with NOTHING sometimes feels a bit like
facing death? At least, ‘Big Void’ does ask for courage, sometimes even for
audacity – and definitely for the relaxation of ‘logic brain’. And many people
shy away from BIG NOTHING and ‘hide’ in what they call ‘real’. I would say,
within our ‘logic brain’ and profit-oriented culture it is definitely an act of
subversion to dare and face BIG NOTHING – let alone to invest in it! :)
So welcome to
both - the subversive and the loving side in you! Get your 'guts' together -
and dare to spend your money here - on NOTHING! 

2. About BIG NOTHING

The BIG
NOTHING project seeks from its very start to stimulate in a very playful and
experimental way the idea and insight in you that NOTHING - or NOTHINGNESS - is
never nothing. On the contrary. BIG NOTHING is always full. Full of sheer
abundance, options, love and joy - ready to materialise, as long as you remain
open and courageous enough to keep engaged with those hidden riches and
creative powers such ‘silent unknown’ has on offer. To invest in BIG NOTHING
could mean that you might experience NOTHING at first, but maybe loads in a
longer run. It may also mean that you are asked to transform your time-based/
logic brain mentality into a more ‘magnetic’ one…  And here’s the point
where meditation or my DACA technique and Coaching may be of help... (s. Perks) 

3. Purpose
& Experience
The feeling
of happiness, bliss and love that you might experience when investing your
money here and now in NOTHING – while expecting NOTHING - is the magic power of
NOTHINGNESS and thus not only the project’s research topic, but also its
highest goal and nature. The miracles or synchronicities you might eventually
start to experience when consciously spending money on our shared BIG NOTHING
belong to the realm of what I call ‘magnetic power’ or ‘somatic-feminine
quality’ which I view as the counterpart to the ‘analytical-masculine quality’
or ‘logic brain’.
If you would
like to find out more about my research in the ‘somatic-feminine’, you are very
welcome to visit my new blog  https://bloggingfeminine.wordpress.com/blogging-feminine or my artwork in film
and theatre (s. info below) or you join me in a healing/ coaching session,
Meditation or Yoga class (s. Perks and Meditation/ Yoga classes updates on FB
&  www.potentialcoaching.de). :)

4. BIG
NOTHING's very nature
Now: the more
people we are here, on this very platform, who are brave enough to subversively
invest big and small sums of money in NOTHING - and who make a NOTHINGNESS experience at the same time, the more abundant and powerful
the BIG NOTHING project’s result will be in the end! And watch the traces life
embraces – when you let BIG NOTHING ‘speak’. ;)
The more
people supporting this project, the bigger and more ground-breaking the BIG
NOTHING’s output and effect as an art project and ‘life-transformer’ will be.
That’s the very nature of this project. NOTHING more. 
Maybe there
will be (amongst many other things) a finished film coming out of BIG NOTHING,
or a book, or a healing art installation reflecting on my and your NOTHINGNESS experiences. Or maybe you’ll meet your NOTHINGNESS on
my personal BIG NOTHING island and research place Ikaria. Whichever. The biggest reward when investing in
NOTHING is the experience of NOTHINGNESS in itself – the experience of its
‘talking’, of its wisdom, its creative powers, which are being unlocked in the
moment you dare to know NOTHING, to expect NOTHING, to plan NOTHING. In such
moments you are free – you feel expanded. You may even feel love. Maybe this project allows you to flow
with such momentum and experience of freedom and expansion a tiny little bit longer,
letting you taste its smell. At least that’s what I experienced after I had to
face BIG NOTHING for months due to a stage accident… And in bringing now the
fruits of such experience into the world and to you personally, fills me up
with a very deep happiness and joy. 
I thank you
so much for joining in – and play the ‘game’ with me! :)

5. About the
Perks
If you look
at the NOTHINGNESS Perks to your right, you’ll find out what kind of investment suits you
best to make BIG NOTHING work – for yourself and as a collective experience.
And from the very moment you make your investment, this project starts to
blossom. That’s the beauty of it. It exists as soon as YOU start it. Please
make it big! And please, spread the words! BE the proof that BIG NOTHING is not
nothing, but EVERTHING beyond love!
When choosing
your Perk (i.e. your investing amount and your specific version of playing the
BIG NOTHING ‘game’/experiment), you have the choice to either make an
investment into ‘plain NOTHINGNESS’ or to invest in a guided version within the
BIG NOTHING experience.
Whichever you
choose, I’m so happy and grateful that you join this subversive experiment and
game, which hopefully brings up lots of magic and abundant personal and
collective experience – and helps many of you finding back to love, bliss and
joy. And please do not use too much ‘logic brain’ when you read this and start
acting along this suggested scheme! ;)
Thank you so
much for your courage, audacity, love & support. You ARE amazing! 

6. How BIG
NOTHING came to birth...
A stage
accident on August 21st 2014 injured not only my head, but also my
day-to-day functioning and identity up to that very day. From one moment to the
next, I hit bottom and I was forced to keep completely still. It kind of felt
like an ‘order of life’, so to speak. I could do NOTHING about it. I could do
NOTHING for it, nor against it. It didn’t help when I moaned, it didn’t help
when I planned nor when I made some prognoses about the speed of my healing.
All I had to learn from that moment onwards was to dare facing NOTHING and
rejoicing its stillness – and eventually its magic.
As an actress
(director and coach) I had also been working self-employed. And for the
performance on that very night I was not insured - as it turned out along the
unfolding of the accident’s repercussions... Thus, to me in this very
situation, hitting bottom and facing NOTHING did not only mean stopping the
‘Doing’, but also stopping earning money by means of ‘Doing’. And that to me
felt at first really scary... 
For a long
time it looked like I was losing everything. No longer being able to resolve my
situation by acts of ‘Doing’ was something I felt very foreign to and which
thus created so much fear in the beginning of such NOTHINGNESS 'process'. Bound
to the sickbed, I felt there was NOTHING I could actively do to save myself.
However, there I still was - and there I still am. And in such experience of
BIG NOTHING, I came to taste the fruits of surrender, the fruits of BEING as a
HUMAN BEING - in moments we manage to rid ourselves of the fear we picked up on and internalized through social conditioning and past traumatic experience... 
I now know
that NOTHING is never NOTHING, but EVERYTHING you are asking for. 
And it’s been
so much I gained since I learnt to let BIG NOTHING do the ‘work’.
I had been a
Meditation and Yoga practitioner for over 20 years before the accident, but it
was only some months after the accident when I started to access and receive
the NOTHINGNESS’ fullest bliss. 
From the
moment I embraced the fact that there was NOTHING I could do other than to
surrender, the situation (at least inside myself) turned round and I started
hitting heights. All the sudden – and more and more often – I felt at complete
ease with the situation I was in, despite the physical pain and the subsequent
emotional condition and turbulence that still kept occurring. All the sudden a
feeling of deep happiness and abundance that was no longer related to the
concrete circumstances of my sickbed situation entered my life. And such
experience was quite something.
Because, it
made me understand that NOTHING is not NOTHING, but EVERYTHING embracing love,
joy, opportunities and happiness – if we do dare to enter a dialogue with the
‘BIG VOID’. 
This
experience changed my life for ever and let me understand the nature of healing
and ‘magnetic power’ to a greater depth.
It also became my artistic research topic so to speak.
And that is now what I would love to share with you with BIG NOTHING: turning my personal experience into a (healing) (community) art
project…

7. THE BIG
NOTHING's Summery 
The BIG
NOTHING….
… is an art
project encouraging its investors and audience to enter a shared experience
with NOTHINGNESS and opening up for individual & experience-based proof
that NOTHING is NOT NOTHING, but EVERYTHING beyond love – in the moment when we
allow ourselves to shift focus from ‘logic’ brain to ‘somatic’ brain.
… is – at its
very beginning - an art project in which the project investors are at the same
time the project's receivers/ audience.
… is an art
project which comes to life as soon as its investors and receivers start
investing money in BIG NOTHING.
… is an art
project which scale and extent is dependent on its investors/ audience degree
of subversiveness and ‘appetite’ to spend money for/ in NOTHING.
… is a
process-oriented experiment with the ‘Non-Space’ (the ‘Big Void’) which has no
concrete intent regarding its final outcome. There might be a film, a book or
live Performance Acts arising out of the project and the experience with BIG
NOTHING. However, the projects emphasis does not lay on a previously defined
final product, but on the process itself, the shared experience and the
questions it triggers.

Projektbeschreibung auf Deutsch


1. Die Fülle im NICHTS: Projektbeschreibung 
1.1. Das NICHTS & die FÜLLE
Einmal mehr für ‚Nichts‘ Geld ausgeben! 
Das ist das Projekt. Nur dieses eine Mal ganz bewusst - und dabei FÜLLE erleben! Wie geht denn das?! :)
Mit der Unterstützung dieses Projekts bekommst
Du die Möglichkeit und Plattform geschenkt, eine neue Erfahrung/ ein Experiment
mit dem NICHTS zu machen. 
Das Projekt dient - schon im Prozess seiner
Entstehung - als Spielfläche der Erkenntnis, dass das NICHTS nie nichts ist,
sondern immer auch ein Vakuum schierer Fülle und Liebe beinhaltet - also
letztendlich reines 'Lebenselixier' ist ... solange Du Dich auf diese Qualität,
d.h. die im NICHTS geborgene Schaffens- und Kreativkraft einlässt und Du
'subversiv' genug bist, einmal für länger NICHTS zu erleben und/ oder Dein Geld
einfach einmal bewusst ins NICHTS zu investieren. Kommt dann wirklich NICHTS
zurück? 
Deine Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS ist Inhalt des Projekts!
1.2. Das NICHTS als Momentum 
In diesem Projekt, welches das NICHTS zum Thema macht, steht die im NICHTS (oder in der 'Lücke') erlebbare FÜLLE im Zentrum. Das
Glücksgefühl, welches Du (von mir begleitet oder nicht) durch Deine Investition
ins NICHTS (s. Perks rechts) womöglich erleben wirst, ist der höchste Sinn
dieses Projekts - welches sich ferner auch mit der im NICHTS verankerten
'weiblich-somatischen'/ 'magnetischen' Kreativkraft (als Gegenpol zur
'männlich-analytischen' Kreativkraft) auseinandersetzt. Ein Themenkreis,
welcher mich seit meinem Bühnenunfall am 21. August 2014 künstlerisch
intensiver beschäftigt (s. auch https://bloggingfeminine.wordpress.com/blogging-feminine)  - und aus welchem vielleicht einmal ein Film entsteht und/ oder ein Buch. 
Je mehr Menschen JETZT für dieses Projekt mit
grossen und mit kleinen Summen ganz subversiv ins NICHTS investieren - desto
kraftvoller wird die damit erzeugte Fülle sein. Und nach und nach wird diese
Fülle auch äusserlich sicht- und erlebbar werden. In Deinem Leben wie in
meinem. Wenn wir uns dafür öffnen. Lasst uns also diesen Moment gemeinsam
kreieren! :) 
1.3. Deine persönliche Erfahrung mit dem
NICHTS als Teil des Gesamtwerks
Kommt eine grosse, mutige Masse an NICHTS
Investititionen hier bei diesem Crowdfunding (und hoffentlich bald auch auf einer eigenen Webseite) zusammen, steht am Ende
tatsächlich auch ein künstlerisches Werk. Doch dieses Werk, bzw. ein im Vorfeld
anvisiertes und definiertes Endprodukt, ist nicht das erste Ziel dieses
Projekts. Das Ziel ist Eure/ Deine individuelle (und damit auch kollektive)
Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS und das Erleben, dass das eigentlich Gewinnbringende
am Investieren ins NICHTS das NICHTS selber ist - die Erfahrung seiner
Schöpfungs-Potenz. Und diese Schöpfungspotenz und Kreativkraft erschliesst sich
erst über unseren aller Mut, NICHTS zu wissen, NICHTS zu erwarten, NICHTS zu
planen, wenn wir ins NICHTS investieren. Im NICHTS begegnen wir dem SELBST. Und nur wenn wir das NICHTS wirklich an
uns heran lassen und es aushalten, kann es seine Kraft und Liebe erschliessen
und ein Tor sein zu unserem persönlichen Glück. Und dieses Glück, das durch
Deine/ Eure Investition ins NICHTS entsteht, wünsche ich Dir und Euch von
Herzen.

2. Die Perks: 
Eure Investition - Euer Vertrauen ins NICHTS! 
Schaut gerne bei den Perks (rechts aussen), wie
Ihr das NICHTS mit mir zusammen in Schwingung bringen könnt. Von dem Moment an,
an dem Ihr hier mutig und mit Spiellust ins NICHTS investiert, fängt dieses
Projekt an zu erblühen. Und jeder Betrag, jede einzelne Erfahrung von und mit
Euch wird ein Beitrag dieser aus dem NICHTS entspringenden und kollektiv
erlebbaren Fülle sein. 
Die Perks überlassen Euch die Wahl, ob Ihr bei der Investition ins NICHTS meine
Begleitung wünscht - oder ob Ihr restlos frei von jeglicher Absicht und
Prognose ins stille NICHTS zu investieren wagt.
Vom schieren Investieren ins reine NICHTS, bis zu kurzen oder längeren
begleiteten Sessions im 'Nicht-Raum' (über Telefon-Skype-Viber, im Yogaraum
oder an Naturplätzen Ikarias) ist alles möglich. Ich freue mich auf die Begegnung mit Euch im NICHTS auf Ikaria und auch anderswo. Und über die Ergebnisse meiner künstlerischen Erforschung des NICHTS halte ich Euch ebenfalls gerne auf dem Laufenden.
Für welche Art NICHTS-Investition Ihr Euch auch
immer entscheidet, ich freue mich auf dieses Spiel, dieses Experiment mit Euch
- Eure Liebe, Eure 'Subversivität' und Euren MUT!! 
Ihr seid grandios! Danke! Und hoch lebe sie, die Fülle im NICHTS, die Fülle in der 'Lücke' - inmitten unserer durchorganisierten Leistungskultur!

3. Hintergrund/ Entstehung der Projektidee 
Ein Bühnenunfall am 21.August 2014 riss mich als
Schauspielerin (Regisseurin & Potential Coach) jäh aus meinem bisherigen
Leben und ich lernte zwangsläufig (doch endlich!) von heute auf morgen das
Still-Liegen und Verweilen - das 'NICHTS tun', das 'NICHTS wollen', das
'Aufgeben', das 'Hingeben' kennen. 
Ich praktizierte schon viele
Jahre vor dem Unfall Meditation und Yoga. Doch nach dem Unfall erst lernte und
lerne ich in aller Konsequenz, was es heisst, 'nur' zu SEIN, bzw.
'Mit-dem-NICHTS-sein'. 
Und in diesem SEIN, in diesem erlebten IM NICHTS
SEIN, packte mich und entdeckte ich dann mit einem Mal diese schiere Fülle -
erlebte ich die Potenz des stillen Seins - die Potenz des NICHTS: das gefühlte
schiere Glück! Und Magie - bzw. der 'magnetische' Raum - fing an mit mir zu
sprechen... 
Auch wenn vieles in dieser Zeit nach dem Unfall
sehr schlimm war und mich neben den Schmerzen auch die Angst immer wieder
packte (als selbständige Künstlerin war ich zum Beispiel bezüglich dem Unfall
und seinen Folgen nicht abgesichert...), hat mich diese spezifische Stille- und
Glücks-Erfahrung so sehr überrascht; hat sie meine Kapazitäten (als Künstlerin,
als Mensch und in der Heilung) so sehr verstärkt, dass das 'stille NICHTS'
mittlerweile wie von selbst das neue Selbstverständnis meiner Kunst und Arbeit
geworden ist - und eine Erfahrung, die ich gerne über meine künstlerische
Arbeit hinaus mit Euch teilen möchte. Deshalb BIG NOTHING als Projekt, von dem
ich hoffe, dass es 'unser gemeinsames' wird!

4. BIG NOTHING & die westlich geprägte
Leistungs- und Konsumkultur
Der Blick auf die westliche, dem TUN & HABEN
verpflichtete Gesellschaft lässt mich vermuten, dass eine Investition ins
NICHTS mittlerweile der subversivste persönliche, gesellschaftliche, politische
und künstlerische Akt ist, den wir - als von uns SELBST entfremdete HUMAN
DOINGS - im 'Rasen der Zeit' und im Kontext unserer Gier nach immer mehr -
überhaupt noch vollziehen können.
Und nur in diesem subversivsten Akt einer
Investition ins NICHTS, bzw. in die tiefste innere Stille der Dinge hinein,
sehe ich noch eine Möglichkeit, dass wir westlich geprägten Menschen vielleicht
doch noch irgendwann wieder vom HUMAN DOING zurück zu unserem eigentlichen
Wesen als HUMAN BEING finden - und die Erde sich vielleicht mit uns doch noch
versöhnt - und uns weiter nährt. 
Es liegt an uns. Der Reichtum ist da. Und
spielend lässt er sich besonders gern erschliessen. Lasst es uns versuchen! JETZT! :) 

4. Zusammenfassung: 
Das Grosse (stille) NICHTSPROJEKT… 
... ist ein Kunstprojekt zur Erfahung des
NICHTS, des 'stillen Seins', des NICHT-MEHR-TUNS und jener Fülle und Kraft, die
wir erleben können, in Momenten, in denen wir jegliche Erwartung, Vorstellung
und Bewertung losgelassen haben...

... ist ein Kunstprojekt, welches Künstler und Investoren, die gleichzeitig
auch die Rezipienten (das Publikum) des Projekts sind, von Anfang an in eine
gleichgestellte Beziehung setzt und in welchem sowohl Künstler als auch das
investierende Publikum/ Rezipient Geben und Nehmen in einer Balance erleben
können - bzw. alle am Projekt Beteiligtenden gemeinsam eine sowohl individuelle
als auch kollektive Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS (dem 'Nicht-Raum') machen.
... ist ein Experiment mit dem NICHT-Raum, an
dessen Anfang lediglich eine vage und offene Vorstellung von einem möglichen
künstlerischen 'Endprodukt' (ein Film, ein Buch, live Performance Acts zum
'stillen Nichts', etc.) steht, welche jedoch für das Projekt selber nicht
ausschlaggebend ist - weil es sich erst noch kristallisieren wird, welches
Endergebnis aus dem NICHT-Raum der sich an diesem Projekt beteiligenden,
investierenden Menschen hervorgehen wird. Eure Investitionen und Erlebnisse
sind es also, die das Projekt in seiner Fülle und seinem Ausdruck definieren.
Und je mehr Menschen ins NICHTS zu investieren wagen, umso grösser wird die
WELLE an Erleben und Fülle sein, die letztendlich - natürlich - auch auch einen
künstlerischen Ausdruck findet.  :)
... ist eine Art 'Public Art Projekt', bei dem
Du schon in der Phase der Finanzierung eingeladen bist, die konkrete
inhaltliche Erfahung mit dem Nicht-Raum (bzw. der 'weiblich-somatischen'/
'magnetischen' Qualität) zu machen. (s. Perks)

<h3>Nectar Farm <br/>
</h3>
<p>“Of all the paths you take in life make sure a few of them
are dirt.” - John Muir</p>
<p>When we had the impulse to create an authentic art gallery and site for small-scale farming, we made the
conscious decision to create Nectar Farm as a  flash-point and resource to promote the arts and develop community
through the arts, nature and
contemplative practices.</p>
<p>We seek to transform Nectar Farm into a space for art and community in open fields
and in quiet forests set against a backdrop of breathtaking mountain views. The vision is to create a community home
art gallery, that can provide instruction, inspiration and creative nourishment
on thirty-five acres of peaceful wildlife corridor surrounded by hundreds of
acres of protected land. </p>
<p>Nectar Farm is a sanctuary – critical for people wanting to
experience solace, silence, nature and art.  Artists and contemplatives will find inspiration and
renewal, whether from drinking in the nectar of the place, participating in
classes, constructing temporary environmental site-specific installations,
setting up an easel in a beautiful field, writing, making music – there is much
opportunity for people of all ages to emerge and evolve with the changing
seasons in a place that centers community. </p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Fostering Engagement, Enrichment &amp; Exchange </h3>
<i>""One of the things that Nectar Farm does well, and one of the more special
things is that they are able to
instigate an encourage a conversation between a person, nature and art. I think
that is enormously special and that Nectar Farm tremendously adds to the
regions ecosystem”</i> <i>CTH, photographer</i>
<p></p>
<p><i>“Nectar Farm is a gem, and a constellation that compliments
the ecosystem of Southern NH. If we can keep that shining brightly, I think it
will continue for many years and even generations to come.” DS, artist and educator<br/></i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>“Our only hope may be falling in love with the Earth again.”</i>
<i>Thich Nhat Hahn</i> </p>
<p>As stewards, we continually deepen our understanding of the
local ecosystem while providing a cultural heartbeat – and always growing
more mindful of balance with nature.
</p>
<p>Now we too must grow our capacity to support and celebrate
Nectar Farm’s incredible beauty and potential. But we can’t do it alone. Help
us empower people’s longing to experience their senses and community in nature
and art. </p>
<p>Thank you,                                                                                                                                      <br/></p>

“Of all the paths you take in life make sure a few of them
are dirt.” - John Muir
When we had the impulse to create an authentic art gallery and site for small-scale farming, we made the
conscious decision to create Nectar Farm as a  flash-point and resource to promote the arts and develop community
through the arts, nature and
contemplative practices.
We seek to transform Nectar Farm into a space for art and community in open fields
and in quiet forests set against a backdrop of breathtaking mountain views. The vision is to create a community home
art gallery, that can provide instruction, inspiration and creative nourishment
on thirty-five acres of peaceful wildlife corridor surrounded by hundreds of
acres of protected land. 
Nectar Farm is a sanctuary – critical for people wanting to
experience solace, silence, nature and art.  Artists and contemplatives will find inspiration and
renewal, whether from drinking in the nectar of the place, participating in
classes, constructing temporary environmental site-specific installations,
setting up an easel in a beautiful field, writing, making music – there is much
opportunity for people of all ages to emerge and evolve with the changing
seasons in a place that centers community. 




Fostering Engagement, Enrichment & Exchange 
""One of the things that Nectar Farm does well, and one of the more special
things is that they are able to
instigate an encourage a conversation between a person, nature and art. I think
that is enormously special and that Nectar Farm tremendously adds to the
regions ecosystem” CTH, photographer

“Nectar Farm is a gem, and a constellation that compliments
the ecosystem of Southern NH. If we can keep that shining brightly, I think it
will continue for many years and even generations to come.” DS, artist and educator

“Our only hope may be falling in love with the Earth again.”
Thich Nhat Hahn 
As stewards, we continually deepen our understanding of the
local ecosystem while providing a cultural heartbeat – and always growing
more mindful of balance with nature.

Now we too must grow our capacity to support and celebrate
Nectar Farm’s incredible beauty and potential. But we can’t do it alone. Help
us empower people’s longing to experience their senses and community in nature
and art. 
Thank you,                                                                                                                                      
Nectar Farm

</h3>
<p><b>The Feminist Art Project - Baltimore</b> recognizes the aesthetic, intellectual and political impact of all women on visual arts, as well as history and culture, <span>regardless of race, class or creed. We are a grassroots, non-profit arts organization which aims 
to be inclusive; supporting local, self-identified female artists, as 
well as men who recognize and promote Baltimore area women in the arts. </span></p>
<p>We are seeking funding, in an effort to host a variety of free programs, events and opportunities for artists and neighbors in Baltimore City and the surrounding area.  In our less than two years of operation, we've held a range of free artistic and cultural events...with an operating budget of exactly ZERO. <br/></p>
<p><i>How do we do it? By using incredible amounts of collective craftiness!</i></p>
<p>There are costs involved in hosting events, especially 
free ones. Your donation will enable us to support the work of the women 
behind the scenes of TFAPB, who plan, coordinate, create, promote, scheme, 
inspire, prep, set-up, host, put the wheels in motion and clean up 
afterward.<i><br/></i></p>
<p>We think we can do a whole lot more with just a little bit of money. After all, our communities will ultimately reap the benefits! We love working with other, non-profit organizations, which serve women and children in the community. With funding, we could help to support them even more.<br/></p>
<p>Our membership includes artistic and holistic professionals as well as Students, Community Artists, Curators, Writers and Teachers...but we welcome collaborators of diverse backgrounds.<br/></p>
<p>Besides all of the awesome work we do, we have a lot of fun. A healthy sense of humor is practically a MUST as a woman in the Art World!</p>
<p>The Feminist Art Project - Baltimore is a program of Fusion Partnerships, Inc. which serves as our fiscal sponsor. You can always check out who we are and what we do in greater detail, at our website!<a href=""http://tfapbmore.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">  http://tfapbmore.blogspot.com/</a><br/></p>

The Feminist Art Project - Baltimore recognizes the aesthetic, intellectual and political impact of all women on visual arts, as well as history and culture, regardless of race, class or creed. We are a grassroots, non-profit arts organization which aims 
to be inclusive; supporting local, self-identified female artists, as 
well as men who recognize and promote Baltimore area women in the arts. 
We are seeking funding, in an effort to host a variety of free programs, events and opportunities for artists and neighbors in Baltimore City and the surrounding area.  In our less than two years of operation, we've held a range of free artistic and cultural events...with an operating budget of exactly ZERO. 
How do we do it? By using incredible amounts of collective craftiness!
There are costs involved in hosting events, especially 
free ones. Your donation will enable us to support the work of the women 
behind the scenes of TFAPB, who plan, coordinate, create, promote, scheme, 
inspire, prep, set-up, host, put the wheels in motion and clean up 
afterward.
We think we can do a whole lot more with just a little bit of money. After all, our communities will ultimately reap the benefits! We love working with other, non-profit organizations, which serve women and children in the community. With funding, we could help to support them even more.
Our membership includes artistic and holistic professionals as well as Students, Community Artists, Curators, Writers and Teachers...but we welcome collaborators of diverse backgrounds.
Besides all of the awesome work we do, we have a lot of fun. A healthy sense of humor is practically a MUST as a woman in the Art World!
The Feminist Art Project - Baltimore is a program of Fusion Partnerships, Inc. which serves as our fiscal sponsor. You can always check out who we are and what we do in greater detail, at our website!  http://tfapbmore.blogspot.com/


  Here's What We'd Do With The Money From You!


 Buy a proper website url
Create TFAPB merchandise, in order to keep us self-sufficient
Buy a button-maker. What can't we do with a button maker?

Pay fees for renting space and/or city permits

Buy art supplies for free community workshops
Supply prizes for ""Org's Choice"" awards for our exhibitions
Buy foods and beverages for upcoming events and exhibitions

Ideally, we'd love funding for a great, permanent space where our group can ""live"", meet and throw events. Currently we're entirely nomadic!


We'd also launch a ton of NEW programs and initiatives that would be free or low-cost, and open to the public! These might include: hosting impressive guest artists and curators, or a feminist film series, or Walpurgisnacht, our annual May Day celebration...and more. 


Your donations will be funding some very useful stuff, but also ""our wildest dreams"", which will always, always contribute to the larger communities' wants and needs. And What Awesome Things Do You Get If You Help?

We also intend to adopt a black cat; the chosen color due to the increased difficulty of finding homes for black cats because of the stigma surrounding them. We hope that our resident friends will bring a smile to our patrons' faces as well as encourage more casual browsing. Adopt, don't shop. To put things in terms of black and white - much like ink on a page - we are going to do this whether our campaign is fully-funded or not. Both of us have experience with small business ownership, from music publishing and distribution to library-inspired ephemera and jewelry-making. We know what it takes to start a small business, and to run it successfully; we understand the trials and tribulations which come with adversity in the small business market and selling wares to niche crowds.Our biggest risk is that we have a single point of failure; our home, business, and vehicle will all be in one place. Because of this, we fully intend on sharpening our personal mechanical and general home-repair skills.One of the biggest challenges facing independent bookstores these days is the advent and rapid growth of markets like Amazon where books are readily available and inexpensively shipped to your front door. We also recognize that horror, thrillers, sci-fi, and comic books might not be everyone's favorites and in some areas of the country they might even be downright unpopular - we hope to show that being scared is actually a good thing. Not only does it release endorphins and dopamine (which are ""happiness hormones""), but being scared also releases oxytocin - a chemical produced by the brain that helps with human bonding. So pick up that next tempting creepy tome, because the family that scares together, stays together!We believe that the experience of browsing a bookstore/sitting in a library is something that people, especially the younger generation, are lacking access to. There is a rich history and culture behind the personal human touch of bookselling that is being stripped down by the internet; with The Road Virus, we can combine the personal touch with the flexibility of setting up shop in communities across the US. As stated in our stretch goals, we want to offer door to door service in the future as well, giving even Amazon a slight run for their money.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>A Letter From the Architect</h2>
<p>After many vicissitudes in the last years with several films and architectural projects, I think it is time to focus again into the art circuit and return to show my works. I have rediscovered the passion for artistic photography - and for science fiction - and I have found the support of many people, friends and collectors who enjoy my works and feel that they produce ""something"" when they are looking at them.</p>
<p>My current challenge is to ""build"" futuristic-architectural visions of 4 Asian metropolis: Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Shanghai. There will be 15-20 large-format photographs of each metropolis. Architecture and science fiction are again together for me.</p>
<p>The result will be exhibited at a traveling exhibition in art galleries in these four cities: in Bangkok the exhibition is confirmed at a wonderful art space in the heart of Bangkok, while galleries in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Shanghai are yet to be confirmed. The dates foreseen for the exhibition are during the first half of 2018.</p>
<p>The pictures will be published in a photo book, and a quality catalog will collect some of the most outstanding photographs.</p>
<p>I would like to receive support from people interested in my work and projects. Rather than offering a single big campaign, I think it is better to make a <strong><i>chain of ""micro-campaigns""</i></strong>, one to cover every step while I can frequently communicate to the people interested how the things are going , the trips, the challenges, how I see every city, the future of their architecture. How the project is going, how it is growing. I will be glad to get your feedback.</p>
<p><i><strong>And a very important first step is to take my work and my project to Tokyo. My work was selected for the International Tokyo Art Fair on 26 and 27 May 2017. It will be an immense showcase and being there is very important to establish useful and necessary contacts for the future of the Metropolis Project.</strong></i></p>
<p>Your support is very important for this project, since the costs of production are quite high.</p>
<p>In gratefulness to your interest and support I offer a collection of rewards with some of my works printed in different supports. Limited signed high-quality prints are also offered. And the catalog I'll print and take to Tokyo.</p>

<h3>My Story:</h3>
<p>I am an interdisciplinary artist and daughter of Mexican immigrants. In my work, I use confection, industrial materials, and the American board game Candy Land as a conceptual framework to juxtapose the borderlands of the U.S. and Mexico. The spaces in the “Candy Lands” of my work relate to immigrant utopian visions of the American Dream.</p>
<p>I was recently invited to exhibit my work at <a href=""http://www.expochicago.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EXPO Chicago</a> this September 2017 as a solo show through my <a href=""http://www.chicagoartistscoalition.org/programs/bolt-residency/2016-2017/yvette-mayorga"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BOLT residency at The Chicago Artists Coalition</a>, curated by Janine Mileaf. I also have been invited this summer to join <a href=""http://www.fountainheadresidency.com/artists/2017/4/2/yvette-mayorga"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Fountainhead Residency</a> in Miami, Florida curated by Jose Carlos Diaz, curator of the Andy Warhol Museum.</p>
<p>During our current political climate,  the opportunity to exhibit my work at EXPO Chicago, is an honor and privilege. It is a crucial time to insert the brown experience in the white cube space, specifically at a venue like EXPO that grants me the opportunity to exhibit at a national and international level. The opportunity to share my work about the immigrant experience with a broader audience will allow for a continuation of the conversation on the brown body politic in America.  My solo show at EXPO will be a continuation and expansion of my recent solo show at <a href=""http://www.chicagoartistscoalition.org/programs/bolt-residency/politics-desire"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Chicago Artists Coalition, ""The Politics of Desire.” </a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>I will use my residency in Miami to create new work for my solo show at EXPO Chicago opening September 2017. During my stay in Miami I will be researching the similarities/differences between the immigrant communities of Miami and Chicago. On my return, in Chicago for EXPO, I will create a new body of work that deals with my father’s crossing of the U.S./Mexico border, by using recordings of conversations between my father and I that portray his detailed experience of crossing the border. Along with my father’s history, I will be implementing recent narratives of deportation and memories I have encountered as a teaching artist in Chicago. The new work will be a large scale immersive installation composed of paintings and sculptures including piping on the walls that will be reminiscent of a space found in the immigrants home.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My goal as an artist is to continue to give voice to the immigrant experience through a feminist lens, retelling the story of my father’s struggle is a way to cultivate the real life experience of the American Dream. (<a href=""https://thirdcoastreview.com/2017/03/13/yvette-mayorgas-artistic-contribution-to-the-immigration-conversation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://thirdcoastreview.com/2017/03/13/yvette-...</a>)</p>

<p><strong><u>Who We Are</u></strong></p>
<p>For 19 years, CulturalDC’s mission has been to “<a href=""http://www.culturaldc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Make Space for Art</a>.” We've brokered over 250,000 square feet of space working with real estate developers, artists, city officials, residents, and other key stakeholders through creative placemaking initiatives, community-centered engagements, and innovative real estate partnerships. Our efforts have resulted in the creation of Atlas Performing Arts Center, Source Theatre, Brookland Arts Lofts, and the 27 artist studios at Monroe Street Market in Brookland.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492723898/mifq1phoju9yokvwfyit.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Our Mission</u></strong></p>
<p>Space4: Art is a new initiative that will continue our strong history of presenting cutting edge artwork and emerging artists through a mobile container gallery. Space4: Art allows artists to transform a fully-outfitted 40ft shipping container into an immersive environment. The container will move across the city for the 2017-2018 season, with a new exhibit and free community events in every neighborhood it visits.</p>
<p>Also embracing a mobile strategy next season, CulturalDC's Space4: Performing Arts initiative will bring innovative performance experiences to unexpected venues across the city, like Blind Whino SW Arts Club and Dupont Underground. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Why We Need Your Help</u></strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>We can't accomplish our goal alone. The process of taking our white walls mobile has a lot of up front costs we need help covering. Every dollar contributed to our $10,000 goal will go directly to the build out of our shipping container. Here's everything we'll need to do in order to get our container up to art gallery standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase and move the container</li>
<li>Paint the outside and inside</li>
<li>Install flooring, track lighting, and gallery walls</li>
<li>Outfit the container with an HVAC system for heating and cooling</li>
<li>Purchase and place solar panels on the roof so the gallery can run off the grid</li>

</div></div>","Who We Are
For 19 years, CulturalDC’s mission has been to “Make Space for Art.” We've brokered over 250,000 square feet of space working with real estate developers, artists, city officials, residents, and other key stakeholders through creative placemaking initiatives, community-centered engagements, and innovative real estate partnerships. Our efforts have resulted in the creation of Atlas Performing Arts Center, Source Theatre, Brookland Arts Lofts, and the 27 artist studios at Monroe Street Market in Brookland.

 
Our Mission
Space4: Art is a new initiative that will continue our strong history of presenting cutting edge artwork and emerging artists through a mobile container gallery. Space4: Art allows artists to transform a fully-outfitted 40ft shipping container into an immersive environment. The container will move across the city for the 2017-2018 season, with a new exhibit and free community events in every neighborhood it visits.
Also embracing a mobile strategy next season, CulturalDC's Space4: Performing Arts initiative will bring innovative performance experiences to unexpected venues across the city, like Blind Whino SW Arts Club and Dupont Underground. 

 
Why We Need Your Help

We can't accomplish our goal alone. The process of taking our white walls mobile has a lot of up front costs we need help covering. Every dollar contributed to our $10,000 goal will go directly to the build out of our shipping container. Here's everything we'll need to do in order to get our container up to art gallery standards:

Purchase and move the container
Paint the outside and inside
Install flooring, track lighting, and gallery walls
Outfit the container with an HVAC system for heating and cooling
Purchase and place solar panels on the roof so the gallery can run off the grid

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Argha Noah is an artist-run civic engagement platform that transforms unused urban spaces into showcases for innovation in art, music, education, urban agriculture, and recreation.  We've been granted Harp Transmission, a shuttered mechanic shop in downtown Atlanta, as the site of our first season of community-oriented programming, and we need your help to bring the space up to snuff and to pay our incredible artists and program instructors!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499779819/rh3pmhittnwfxg4apoxq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>So - what kind of programs does Argha Noah offer Atlanta?</h3>
<p>As a forum for exciting reflections on the future and critical reconsiderations of Atlanta’s past, Argha Noah will play host to workshops, lectures, art exhibitions, film screenings, community dinners, weekend farmers markets, concerts, and even pick-up basketball games. Our programs and events fall under five categories: <strong>art, music, education, recreation, and agriculture.</strong></p>
<p>Our events will grant artists, urban strategists and community members an opportunity to both enjoy enriching programs, and break bread with civic organizations producing innovative solutions to the Atlanta’s most pressing problems.</p>

<h3>The Bigger Picture - or, why our work is important.</h3>
<p>With each edition of Argha Noah, we advance a holistic, inclusive model of cultural &amp; technological exchange that imparts both practical knowledge and creative sustenance to a host community.</p>
<p>And in partnering with artists, city officials, and community stakeholders to create 21st century civic spaces, the Argha Noah model changes a region’s development narrative from one based on developer profits, expedience, and non-native interests to one that upholds health, sustainability, and access to the arts as fundamental urban utilities.</p>
<p>And while Atlanta is spoiled for art, culture, and amazing people producing extraordinary work in scholarship, art, and activism, our decentralized urban character often keeps these voices apart. Argha Noah will function not only as a hub for people to discover one another but as a platform for world-class events our neighbors may not have access to otherwise.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our fundraising goal is $25,000. Here's where your money will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crucial renovations to the site, including a good deep clean, new electrical wiring, some leak fixes, and a fresh coat of paint. We're starting with an abandoned car shop and have a long way to go to make the space inviting and safe for visitors.</li>
<li>Furniture - from tables and chairs for community workshops to simple, flexible walls and track lighting for art exhibitions.</li>
<li>Geodesic half-dome stage - for outdoor concerts and lectures.</li>
<li>Paying our artists and staff. We're taking a stand against rampant exploitation in the creative industry by pledging to pay the artists we commission to produce work for us! We believe there should be no excuse, however small our organization and however big our dreams may be! Your contribution helps us stand up against precarious labor practices.</li>
<li>Building materials, soil, and seeds for our community garden.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we meet our fundraising goal, we can afford to make 90% of our events free to the public. The less money we raise, the less accessible our programming will be - so we're super motivated to raise as much as we can so that we may to reach the most people possible!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Though each edition of Argha Noah is temporary, programming and events are designed to spur growth and connections long past the duration of our residency. We want to start a movement, and we believe that begins with sharing common space.</p>
<p>We're using the space to inspire Atlanta with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fresh Knowledge</li>
<li>New Friendship</li>
<li>Contemporary Experiences</li>
</ul>
<p>This is about envisioning a vibrant and socially responsible future together!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Argha Noah team is running on a tight schedule to get our space open. We only have the space until the end of the year, and we want to offer as many events as possible until then. But there's a lot to finish before we invite the community into our space.</p>
<p>Our biggest challenges include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indoor renovations</li>
<li>Outdoor renovations</li>
<li>Material supplies</li>
</ul>
<p>These things rely on funding and volunteer support. We've been able to start the renovation process with our own team and funding, but we hope to kick things into a higher gear with outside support.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>We need plenty of other things besides just funding. The site still needs a lot of work, and we're busy every day preparing.  You can help us bring Argha Noah to Atlanta by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Volunteering- help clean the building or set-up an event </li>
<li>Donating materials- we need building and workshops materials; furniture would be great, too!  </li>
<li>Sharing our story- it's a temporary space, so we want to get the word out fast</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, you can also support Argha Noah by attending events! We can't wait to share the journey with you this Summer.   </p>

Paulo Abrantes, I am a photographer and I was invited by The Brick Lane Gallery
to be part of the group exhibition LANDSCAPE; RURAL VS URBAN, that will take place
in London from the 12th  - 25th of April
2016.LANDSCAPE; RURAL VS URBAN questions our interpretation
of landscapes and different sceneries through the appreciation of nature on its
own and the exploration of man intervened urban settings. The show brings
together a vibrant range of local and international artists who focus on the
different ways we relate to the places we inhabit and the impact we have on
them.
Photos available for the exhibition

The Brick Lane Gallery  is located in the creative art
district of east London, in Brick Lane. Brick Lane is not only a very lively and popular
location for art and culture, it is also just a few steps away from the
financial district. Brick Lane is also one of the most popular areas in the
city of London for Street Art. The possibility of
presenting my work in a privileged setting for cultural events gives continuity
to the internationalisation of my work that had started in Rio de Janeiro
(Brazil) and later in Spain, through the Zamora and Salamanca Museums.

This is, without a
doubt, an interesting visibility opportunity. But, there are costs involved,
costs that are unavailable at this moment. Only through an advanced support,
through the sale of the photographs that will be exhibited, or through other
offers that give you the possibility to also be part of this exhibition in
London.

<p><b>Boto-cor-de-rosa:
books, art and coffee</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Boto-cor-de-rosa is an independent bookstore in Salvador,
Bahia in the northeastern region of Brazil. The name literally translates as
“pink dolphin,” the charming and irresistible figure of many Brazilian folkoric
legends. At the Boto, we believe that providing the physical space and
opportunity to interact with books helps to inspire the pleasure of reading and
also supports independent and local venders whose productions are generally
squandered by megastores and virtual domains in Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Within
a region and culture where few Brazilians enjoy reading and where the only
bookstores in the city are owned by two large franchises, the Boto is not one
among many fish in the sea—it is the <i>only</i>
independent bookstore in all of Salvador, the third largest city in Brazil. The
Boto is the vision of two determined and creative women and a tale of bringing
together local writers, adult and young readers, intellectuals, presses and
those curious enough to read a poem for the very first time. We invite you to
read our story and support us in our fight to keep the Boto’s doors open.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
In a place where few Brazilians enjoy picking up a book, the Boto provides
a physical space for literary lovers and curious first-timers to read, play and
interact with books. Brazil's northeast faces some of the greatest challenges
to improving literacy. Educational disadvantages are unquestionably marked by
class and race—the northeast is the poorest region in Brazil and Salvador is
also home to the largest population of people from the African Diaspora outside
of Africa. But even among those who do read, understanding the pleasure of
literature as a source of imagination, possibility, provocation, and expression
has yet to really take form—70 percent of Brazilians do not read a single book
during the entire year (Fecomércio RJ 2012). For many, their understanding of
literature is limited to required school readings of the classics. And those
who want to go to a bookstore only have the option of walking into big shopping
malls where franchise bookstores and megastores are dominated by large
publishing companies and the winners of national literary prizes (the majority
of which are male writers from Brazil’s southeastern metropolises). Rarely do
Bahians and other Brazilians see their vibrant imaginations and histories
reflected in these literary displays. But two women, along with several friends
and volunteers along the way, have created a space that through books, art and
community has realized a cultural, social and political vision.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Two women at the front of the Boto’s vision and charm</b></p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;""></b></p><p>         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465218636/Milena_and_Sarah_vtlgto.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 514.345px;height: 386px;""/></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Milena Britto has spent her entire life and career
dedicated to expanding the spaces, resources and initiatives available for
literary production and experiences. She has worked closely with social
movements, collaborated with poetry slam initiatives and organized literary
workshops throughout the country. She is a university literature professor in
Bahia and witnesses every day how hard it is for youth and adults to get
excited about reading and the barriers they face in gaining access to diverse
literary possibilities. Milena also previously worked for the state Department
of Culture, where she saw the challenges that local writers (especially
women) and small presses face in gaining support from the broader literary
landscape. Throughout all of these different adventures, conversations with
artists, publishers, intellectuals, students, dedicated readers and those who
had never opened a book before, Milena began to dream of opening a bookstore—a
space in Salvador where people could interact with one another, share ideas,
engage in political debates and develop a relationship with books through both
the imaginations they inspire as well as their physicality. But making this
dream a reality required finding the resources as well as the right partner who
shared her passion and vision.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
Sarah Rebecca Kersley, a poet born in the United Kingdom, has been resident in
Brazil for the past twelve years. She lived and worked in the interior of Bahia
for several years, where she opened a small bookstore (before the Boto) to try
to share her passion for reading in a city with no other bookstore and also not
a single public library. But with low literacy levels and few customers, it
became too tough to stay open. Sarah’s passion for poetry and Brazilian
contemporary literature eventually took her to Bahia’s capital of Salvador, a
move that quickly led to an encounter of literary passions, experience and
visions.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
Sarah scraped together all of her savings and joined forces with Milena as
curator to make the Boto a reality. After months of pushing through the
challenges of finding a space, making the necessary renovations (while fighting
against all of the machismo that came with that), learning barista techniques,
meticulously selecting the first titles to stock, and collecting enough
espresso cups and sofa pillows to welcome people in, they finally opened the
doors of the Boto to the public in May 2015.</span><b></b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><span>The
Boto’s vision – contemporary literature, shared space and a local community</span></b></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><span></span></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465218758/944389_808622042615014_3571406170040534348_n_nyoprf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><span></span></b></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Since its opening, the Boto has won over the heart of the
city. It is a free-standing shop with an outdoor sign of a dolphin tail that
sways from a rebellious tree branch jutting into the sidewalk. This cozy space
welcomes Boto regulars and curious passers by with coffee and treats primarily made
by local venders—from the organic coffee beans from the Chapada Diamantina
National Park to the fresh tarts and pastries made by local independent
producers. Since its opening, the Boto has become essential to the
community—from being a safe reading space (of which there are very few here),
to a place for children and youth to develop an early love for reading, a resource for contemporary literature and poetry, a space for lively
readings and book launches, and a site for debate and political discussion.
Many people spend hours flipping through books, sharing how excited they are to
have a place to read and chat that isn’t inside a shopping mall. Others walk in
as they stroll along the street with a clear expression of confusion...having
never seen a bookstore along the street (or anywhere else) with novels, poetry,
theory texts, children's books, and an espresso machine, many come to learn
what a bookstore is for the first time.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Boto walls, shelves and coffee tables are full of various forms of
contemporary literature. But you won’t find many commercial “bestsellers”,
since this product already has its niche and readers. The Boto seeks projects
that challenge literary language (in the plural sense of “literary”) and avoids
the cliché and obvious--this is true both for our adult and children selections. It also displays contemporary texts from other areas
(philosophy, gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, political science,
anthropology, interdisciplinary studies, cultural studies). Our display always
has an excellent selection of local literature and publishing presses and the
criteria are the same as those used for our whole curation process. The
displays  highlight many of Brazil’s underrepresented female writers and
poets, as well as indigenous, Afro-Brazilian, and queer literatures that are
often ignored by the megastores. But a book won’t be in stock just because
it’s from the local scene— “Bahian” literature for us is held to the same
standards as Brazilian literature. In other words, the Boto seeks to
challenge the marginalization of these literatures by highlighting the fact
that they are muted </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">in spite
of </i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">their excellent literary and aesthetic quality.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Boto supports small and independent presses to enter the broader
literary landscape and also shares contemporary literature from throughout the
globe to its local readers. We follow contemporary debates, discussions
and literary launches in  diverse themes and forms not just from Latin
America, but also other continents. </span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465323258/12806257_798358846974667_7139123022187261345_n_mte6ll.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 208.688px;height: 371px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465323374/Children_books_px07if.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 314.386px;height: 236px;background-color: initial;""/></p><p></p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Yes, we are not-for-profit</b></p>

recognized as not-for-profit over six months ago, however, legal and
bureaucratic processes are unfortunately very slow in Bahia, especially for
gaining this type of organizational status. So, we're being transparent here--formally,
we're a business, but not in it at all for the profit and are doing everything
possible to get official recognition for that. In the meantime, we sincerely

They feel that the main culprit behind the incident has everything to do with Mike, the neighborhood hustler, who has been protecting Sean and few others that live on his block.  Now Sean's life and future college plans will be on the line, as other, including his lawyer, must work to prove his incense.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who Am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Don Scully, and I am not your average entrepreneur. You may have heard similar pitches before, but I truly believe my project is unique! The facts are, that I am a collector, who happens to know my passion for reasonably priced vintage art makes good business sense. There is a surprisingly large market for vintage art. I say surprising because I got involved in collecting vintage art prints for fun, but the further I looked into it, I realised just how massive the business is. I had a great time indulging myself in this pastime, so when I moved to Malaga in 2003, I became totally immersed in the artistic culture, which is an obvious side effect of living in the city best known as the birth place of Picasso!</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">My Venture</h3>
<p>As a result of my love of art, I studied how pieces are bought and sold. It can be a pricey pursuit and consequently many collectors are quite wealthy. I am not in that bracket, but I nurtured the idea for people in my category (that of the average Joe) having access to these beautiful items that the better off enjoy. So, I created <a href=""http://artofclass.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Art of Class</strong></a>. I have traded for over ten years here in Spain, and currently I sell on Etsy. I am however, in the process of building a stand alone website for <a href=""http://artofclass.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Art of Class</strong></a> that allows purveyors of art to explore and shop without breaking the bank or spending their child's education fund.</p>
<p>I also understand the importance of mobile shopping today.  With tablets and smartphones as the norm, most people no longer sit at the computer to purchase goods.  They are constantly on the go.  So, I came up with <strong>""Único""</strong>, a Tinder type app for purchasing exclusive YET affordable art! The app will be available through Google Play, and my long term goal includes adding other unique stores to the app in future, to make a shopping experience like no other.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Your Part</h3>
<p>I am currently at a crossroads.  I need help financing the project, or the project ends here. </p>
<p>This is obviously close to my own heart, however, i know it will help other small business entrepreneurs also in the long run.  I am asking the following:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> If you can spare even ten pounds, every little helps! </p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>EVERYBODY</strong> <strong>who donates receives something in return</strong>, and those who contribute more than five pounds will be the recipient of 'at least' the value they have put in - <strong>see Perks column.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Whether you can donate or not, I ask that you share my project with your social network and circles of influence.  The more people that are aware of the project, the more people can help it succeed.</p>
<p><strong>As always, thank you for your continued support.</strong></p>

<p>Hey! My name's Jesús and I'm a circus artist, who
greatly enjoys doing tricks and hanging about in the air. I specialise in
aerial straps. But I also practice slakcline, and recently had a revelation
during my training. </p>
<p>Initially these two circus disciplines don't have
anything in common. Not until I realised the equipment of both practices looks
nearly the same. There it came the idea of using the same prop for both
specialities. </p>
<p>However, aerial straps uses the material in a
vertical position, and hanging from the ceiling. Slackline uses a strap as
well, but this time in the horizontal, and attached to two points in both
extremes, like a couple of trees. So... how could we possibly bring the two together? </p>
<p>We need a structure. A structure that allows the
same strap to be placed in any position: vertical; horizontal; and even more
excitingly, in any degree of inclination, bringing new possibilities for
discovery and development of the practice. </p>
<p>Jeffrey is in charge of the design and build of the
new creature. He is a designer and a mechanical engineer; so yes, you guess
well thinking he's a wicked genius. </p>
<p>We need to gather enough money to pay for the
materials and costs of the construction. These materials need to be of best quality to ensure safety standards are met. But also light, to improve mobility and reduce fuel and
transport costs.</p><p>The creation of this structure will also
take us into a greater journey, where we will develop a show. We will also
need as much help as possible for this period. So getting to a good start is
essential, and could guarantee a much more powerful future. <br/></p>
<p>We believe in people’s power to
make beautiful and daring things happen. If you like our ideas, please support us. No worries
if you can’t help with money, but we’d be really grateful if you can help
spreading the voice. You can use the Indiegogo sharing tools! Or most efficiently, finding
your own ways, and using the good old fashioned word of mouth.

</div><div><div>Hi! I'm Marauder! I'm a professional alternative model who has been modeling for 12 years. I am experienced, versatile, and reliable. I always bring my all to shoots. Lately I've been embarking on the exciting journey of modeling full time. It's been a hell of a trip, and sometimes it's been great, other times not so much. The best way to keep with modeling is to embark on tours to other states and locations in order to  book and work with new photographers along the way, so that's what I've decided to do along with my modeling companion, Astrid Von Winter.<br/><br/>This summer, we're setting our sites on a month long tour to the  West Coast. This is both exciting and terrifying, as we're looking at a month on the road touring to brand new locations and working with new people. It can be really exciting, but it also leaves room for plenty to stress about. <br/><br/>The thing with touring, is you book work, but it doesn't mean people won't cancel at last minute, and this tends to be one of those looming issues. There's also the chance that the person you're staying with in certain states will decide against it, or car troubles will ensue 0.o (the worst fear 0.0). <br/><br/>All this aside, the car we are embarking on this tour with still needs a new tag and insurance on it. I don't think it will be a problem since we have two months to get our things together for the tour, but it's still a looming stress that would be nice to put aside.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this year money is tight. I've embarked on the adventure of opening up a studio with a fellow photographer, and new businesses are more of a drain on the income than profitable until you get them going. All of my focus has been on this, and booking paid shoots has been difficult since my car has no tag or insurance. So, I'm in limbo, I need money to get the tag and title, but I need the car to make money. Isn't that fantastic? ;D<br/><br/>Once we get touring, things will be a lot easier, but until that time, any help that can be given is super appreciated .<br/><br/>ANYWAYS, enough about me. Here's the cool benefits that come with donating.<br/><br/>I'm offering different levels of rewards for each donation. I understand that everyone is going to have different wants and needs, so I'm going to try to offer something for everyone, from photographers to fans. <br/><br/>I have a LARGE collection of all of my nude photoshoots on my computer. One of the big prizes will be an invite to a dropbox folder hosting all of my work, erotic, fetish, nude, you name it. It's like the Masturbator's Guide to the Galaxy (why is this not a porno mag anyways?)<br/><br/>I'm offering signed prints of the photos of your choice, check out my facebook for some of the options, or message me with a request<br/>Facebook.com/xmarauderx <br/><br/>I'm offering custom shoots! Want me to dress like  a school girl and do a strip tease? Can do. Want me to dress like Pikachu for your Pokemon fetish? Why not. I've heard weirder. Want an entire set of my feet? Not a problem. Like I said, versatile, and totally not judgmental of your sexual deviance ;D<br/><br/>Want personal effects? I have so much lingerie and underwear, I actually could really stand to get rid of quite a lot of it. Hit me up with what you're looking for, we can make it happen!<br/><br/>Want to have a Skype chat? We can do that! (No sexual favors yo), but I'm not against playing Truth or Dare, Never Have I Ever, or Strip Hangman on Skype either. <br/><br/>Want to book a shoot before or during my tour? If you book via my indiegogo, I'm offering MAD DISCOUNTS for shooting. <br/><br/>Want something not listed? Rad, let me know.

</div></div></div>","Hi! I'm Marauder! I'm a professional alternative model who has been modeling for 12 years. I am experienced, versatile, and reliable. I always bring my all to shoots. Lately I've been embarking on the exciting journey of modeling full time. It's been a hell of a trip, and sometimes it's been great, other times not so much. The best way to keep with modeling is to embark on tours to other states and locations in order to  book and work with new photographers along the way, so that's what I've decided to do along with my modeling companion, Astrid Von Winter.This summer, we're setting our sites on a month long tour to the  West Coast. This is both exciting and terrifying, as we're looking at a month on the road touring to brand new locations and working with new people. It can be really exciting, but it also leaves room for plenty to stress about. The thing with touring, is you book work, but it doesn't mean people won't cancel at last minute, and this tends to be one of those looming issues. There's also the chance that the person you're staying with in certain states will decide against it, or car troubles will ensue 0.o (the worst fear 0.0). All this aside, the car we are embarking on this tour with still needs a new tag and insurance on it. I don't think it will be a problem since we have two months to get our things together for the tour, but it's still a looming stress that would be nice to put aside.Unfortunately, this year money is tight. I've embarked on the adventure of opening up a studio with a fellow photographer, and new businesses are more of a drain on the income than profitable until you get them going. All of my focus has been on this, and booking paid shoots has been difficult since my car has no tag or insurance. So, I'm in limbo, I need money to get the tag and title, but I need the car to make money. Isn't that fantastic? ;DOnce we get touring, things will be a lot easier, but until that time, any help that can be given is super appreciated .ANYWAYS, enough about me. Here's the cool benefits that come with donating.I'm offering different levels of rewards for each donation. I understand that everyone is going to have different wants and needs, so I'm going to try to offer something for everyone, from photographers to fans. I have a LARGE collection of all of my nude photoshoots on my computer. One of the big prizes will be an invite to a dropbox folder hosting all of my work, erotic, fetish, nude, you name it. It's like the Masturbator's Guide to the Galaxy (why is this not a porno mag anyways?)I'm offering signed prints of the photos of your choice, check out my facebook for some of the options, or message me with a requestFacebook.com/xmarauderx I'm offering custom shoots! Want me to dress like  a school girl and do a strip tease? Can do. Want me to dress like Pikachu for your Pokemon fetish? Why not. I've heard weirder. Want an entire set of my feet? Not a problem. Like I said, versatile, and totally not judgmental of your sexual deviance ;DWant personal effects? I have so much lingerie and underwear, I actually could really stand to get rid of quite a lot of it. Hit me up with what you're looking for, we can make it happen!Want to have a Skype chat? We can do that! (No sexual favors yo), but I'm not against playing Truth or Dare, Never Have I Ever, or Strip Hangman on Skype either. Want to book a shoot before or during my tour? If you book via my indiegogo, I'm offering MAD DISCOUNTS for shooting. Want something not listed? Rad, let me know. Let's make this shit happen!I listed the goal as 1000, but I'd be happy to get halfway to that goal. Anything you can contribute helps, even if all you can do is share it along.What's more?I'm working on building a password protected blog or site of sorts for the trip.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hi! Thanks for taking a look at our campaign. My name is Anlezia Moné Venter. I created this story, developed and wrote the script, am currently busy in pre-production as Executive Producer, and later on, I will star as the protagonist in my first original screenplay: MATA HARI. I am currently in my last semester as a BFA Acting student at NYFA with full talent-based scholarship. </li>
<li>In order to graduate, for part of my Thesis, I am to write, develop, produce and star in a short film. I was inspired by the story of <strong>Mata Hari</strong>. She was an undercover spy and exotic dancer in WW1, mainly in Paris. <strong>She was executed by firing squad in 1917, and her case was ordered to be sealed shut by the French Government for a 100 years.</strong> Next year, thus only, will the alluring mystery surrounding the infamous Mata Hari, be cleared up. Life is hard and unfair, and people like Mata Hari take the fall for government mistakes everyday. This is a tribute to her life. </li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475287033/whxrqn6jpb7gr9cm4t2z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>​</p>
<ul>
<li>My film is a fictional interpretation of Mata Hari, a jazz singer and undercover spy, who was betrayed and turned into the government by the only man she wasn't with just to get information. <strong>She fell in love, and paid the ultimate price for it. </strong>
</li>
<li>It is important to me to tell this story to honor the memory of Mata Hari and what a celebratory, unapologetically beautiful woman she was. Up until her last moment, she chose dignity. She chose to express herself freely, instead of bowing her head and accepting defeat - despite the unjust things that happened to her.</li>
<li>On her last day, facing a firing squad of 12 soldiers, she refused to be tied to a pole. She wanted to look the soldiers who were about to shoot her, in their eyes. She removed her blindfold, blew a kiss to the soldiers and was shot dead. This is what my film will revolve around - her last moments and what lead up to that. </li>
<li>With your generous support and donations, this tribute could be made a reality. With the funds raised, not only will I be able to finish this project I've been working on for months, and graduate with a BFA degree, I will also be able to have a film of high quality that I will be able to submit to numerous film festivals and share this beautiful tragedy, as well as gain exposure from the storytelling veterans in this industry - actors, directors, producers we all look up to. </li>
<li>The exposure of this film will ultimately help me in the application for my O-1 Artists Visa, a visa that will allow me to work as an actress in the United States, which is a lifelong dream. </li>
<li>When successful as a short film in the festival circuit, I also dream to develop this story into a feature film; Mata Hari's story is so rich and beautiful, I am extremely passionate about giving her life more than 5 minutes of tribute, (when we get there). </li>
</ul>
<p>But for now...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Films are really expensive to make, no matter the size. This is technically a no-budget film, however, below follows a breakdown of the funds we need to make this vision a reality. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476329042/ie6hufrnztrj7jiiehk5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Meals &amp; Craft Services: </strong>The very hardworking crew and cast need to refuel their energy!</li>
<li>
<strong>Props: </strong>Our story is set in WW1, thus to make it look beautiful, we need a lot of 'period' props. </li>
<li>
<strong>Costumes: </strong>To truthfully convey the 'world' the story is set in, accurate costuming is essential. </li>
<li>
<strong>Set-Dressing: </strong>The set-dressing incorporates and completes the world wherein the story is set. In a period piece, it is essential for all the detail of the set time period to be represented as accurately as possible. </li>
<li>
<strong>Transportation &amp; Travel: </strong>Firstly, We need to transport all the equipment and props from Cape Town to the town the locations are in. Furthermore, Principal Photography is scheduled for South Africa, because we found an absolutely amazing crew there, and production costs are lowered significantly, but first we need to get there. </li>
<li>
<strong>Equipment: </strong>To make the film look great, we need camera and lighting equipment. </li>
<li>
<strong>Hair &amp; Make-Up: </strong>A lot of detail goes into making the cast look like they're from the 1910's. </li>
<li>
<strong>Film Festivals: </strong>Believe it or not, film festivals average about $40 - $50 per festival. Screening this film at festivals around the world to industry professionals, will make the months of hard work and all the funds worth it. </li>
<li>
<strong><font>Insurance: </font></strong><font>For the safety of everyone involved on set as well as the wonderful equipment, production insurance is required to make sure we don't have any unwanted surprises. </font>
</li>
<li>
<strong><font>Contingency: </font></strong><font>Despite months of meticulous planning, unforeseen things always come up. </font>
</li>
<li>If we don't reach the minimum funds goal, we will put the raised funds firstly towards absolutely essential set-dressing and props. All raised funds will go toward covering costs of making this film. </li>
<li>
<b>Fee - </b>Indiegogo fee for raising the money. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are numerous amounts of daily challenges involved in creating and producing a film, but everyone involved by making and funding it can be sure it will get made before this year is over. #'nboermaak'nplan.</p>

Next year, thus only, will the alluring mystery surrounding the infamous Mata Hari, be cleared up. Life is hard and unfair, and people like Mata Hari take the fall for government mistakes everyday. This is a tribute to her life. 

​

My film is a fictional interpretation of Mata Hari, a jazz singer and undercover spy, who was betrayed and turned into the government by the only man she wasn't with just to get information. She fell in love, and paid the ultimate price for it. 

It is important to me to tell this story to honor the memory of Mata Hari and what a celebratory, unapologetically beautiful woman she was. Up until her last moment, she chose dignity. She chose to express herself freely, instead of bowing her head and accepting defeat - despite the unjust things that happened to her.
On her last day, facing a firing squad of 12 soldiers, she refused to be tied to a pole. She wanted to look the soldiers who were about to shoot her, in their eyes. She removed her blindfold, blew a kiss to the soldiers and was shot dead. This is what my film will revolve around - her last moments and what lead up to that. 
With your generous support and donations, this tribute could be made a reality. With the funds raised, not only will I be able to finish this project I've been working on for months, and graduate with a BFA degree, I will also be able to have a film of high quality that I will be able to submit to numerous film festivals and share this beautiful tragedy, as well as gain exposure from the storytelling veterans in this industry - actors, directors, producers we all look up to. 
The exposure of this film will ultimately help me in the application for my O-1 Artists Visa, a visa that will allow me to work as an actress in the United States, which is a lifelong dream. 
When successful as a short film in the festival circuit, I also dream to develop this story into a feature film; Mata Hari's story is so rich and beautiful, I am extremely passionate about giving her life more than 5 minutes of tribute, (when we get there). 

But for now...

What We Need & What You Get
Films are really expensive to make, no matter the size. This is technically a no-budget film, however, below follows a breakdown of the funds we need to make this vision a reality. 



Meals & Craft Services: The very hardworking crew and cast need to refuel their energy!

Props: Our story is set in WW1, thus to make it look beautiful, we need a lot of 'period' props. 

Costumes: To truthfully convey the 'world' the story is set in, accurate costuming is essential. 

Set-Dressing: The set-dressing incorporates and completes the world wherein the story is set. In a period piece, it is essential for all the detail of the set time period to be represented as accurately as possible. 

Transportation & Travel: Firstly, We need to transport all the equipment and props from Cape Town to the town the locations are in. Furthermore, Principal Photography is scheduled for South Africa, because we found an absolutely amazing crew there, and production costs are lowered significantly, but first we need to get there. 

Equipment: To make the film look great, we need camera and lighting equipment. 

Hair & Make-Up: A lot of detail goes into making the cast look like they're from the 1910's. 

Film Festivals: Believe it or not, film festivals average about $40 - $50 per festival. Screening this film at festivals around the world to industry professionals, will make the months of hard work and all the funds worth it. 

Insurance: For the safety of everyone involved on set as well as the wonderful equipment, production insurance is required to make sure we don't have any unwanted surprises. 


Contingency: Despite months of meticulous planning, unforeseen things always come up. 

If we don't reach the minimum funds goal, we will put the raised funds firstly towards absolutely essential set-dressing and props. All raised funds will go toward covering costs of making this film. 

Fee - Indiegogo fee for raising the money. 


Risks & Challenges
There are numerous amounts of daily challenges involved in creating and producing a film, but everyone involved by making and funding it can be sure it will get made before this year is over. #'nboermaak'nplan.

This singular experience created my lifelong love of East Africa. I grew up to be a fine artist, filmmaker and now, entrepreneur.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Erinn Kathryn and Jen LaMastra, two accomplished Portland based artists, have teamed up to create the Little Free Gallery Project. 
Little Free Gallery Project converts twenty ""little free libraries"" throughout Portland into miniature galleries exhibiting art installations for the duration of one month in summer 2016.
Twenty amazingly talented local artists have been assigned a library box somewhere in Portland's east side. Working with the library box owner, each artist will create a new site-specific piece. The project culminates with a bike/walking map tour designed by Jen and Erinn that allows the community to explore and find the Little Free Galleries around the city. 
Help keep Portland Weird!
With the ever changing landscape of Portland and the growing population, it is important to foster that which made this city great; keep art flooding the city and available to all.  It is Erinn and Jen's wish to offer a unique creative opportunity for artists to show their work, and to engage the community in a fun free-- quirky experience.  
Your financial contribution will give each artist a small stipend to create their work. It will help defray the printing costs of our free walk/bike map, and help sponsor a full-color exhibition catalog including artist bios, photos, artist statements.  Your funds will also support our launch/exibition party on June 17 at the Lightbox Kulturhaus.
   What We Need & What You Get Simply put, we want to pay the artists for talents, time and commitment.  We want to provide those free printed maps , and we want to host a launch party to generate hype and participation.
Here is a more detailed break down of the numbers:
20 artists X $50 = $1000.
Printing 1000, full-color double-sided tri-fold maps: $379
Printing 50 full-color catalogs @7.57 each: $378
Renting launch party space: $250
Food and beverages: $200
Graphic Design/Photography/Curatorial/Admin : $300

As a Thank you for your fiscal support we're offering some very exciting perks.

The Impact
 
Little Free Gallery Project strives to provide exhibition opportunities for emerging Portland artists, with a focus on generating opportunities to show temporal, site-specific, non-commodifiable work; work for which we believe Portland has an ongoing deficit.  The artists we have selected stem from a range of media and disciplines- from painting to metal work, video to wearable sculpture- for a breadth of style, theme and concept.  For many of them, installation will be a new and exciting challenge.  
Since this project exists in residential neighborhoods, it is possible or one to ""stumble across"" a Little Free Gallery. We anticipate viewers who are not specifically seeking an art experience- those who are not generally ""gallery-goers"". We embrace the opportunity to provide greater exposure for local artists that do not have [traditional] gallery representation. We wish to foster community connections the would not otherwise have existed.

<br/><h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi there, my name is Megan Jones and I am a member of the Kestrel Clay dynamic duo, along with my fiance, Chad Collins. I just completed the MFA in Illustration Practice at MICA, while Chad has an MAT from the University of Central Missouri. We are both teachers and ceramic artists based in Baltimore, MD looking to develop our business and teaching practice.  We are both dedicated artists who have recently begun expanding from private sales and limited gallery representation to small markets and festivals. </p>
<p> The Kestrel Clay Throw-Down is our way of having fun and reaching out to the wider online community. I was especially excited at how well my home town teams did this year, and Chad came up with a brilliant idea: Our own competition! We will each run an independent campaign to see who can raise the most funds toward getting us to the NCECA conference this year in Kansas City, MO. In the end, we will pool our funds together, but the winner gets bragging rights and the loser gets a bucket of muddy clay dumped on their head (with a video of course so that you can enjoy it as much as we do! Hopefully i'll be the one dumping clay on Chad's head, since again it was his ever so brilliant idea). </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get From Us!</h3>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454644795/hpojrjkphqzplgcmo1uv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>We need $1300 bare minimum to travel to Kansas City March 16-23 to participate in NCECA's annual conference. NCECA (The National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts) is a massive gathering of the minds, with a city full of galleries and venues filled with amazing ceramic work.  This venue will give us access to international artists, organizations, residency opportunities, and vendors that will help guide us along the path of successful art entrepreneurs. It is THE conference for those in the ceramic arts to learn, share, and make new contacts.</p>
<p>To get there, we will need: </p>
<p>$600- Round Trip Flights for two</p>
<p>$700- 4 day Conference Passes for two</p>
<p>We are fortunate enough to have family in the area, who are graciously letting us crash in our (Megan's) old bedroom. So housing for the event is free! Lucky us! </p>
<p>Any additional monies raised beyond these needs will go toward the development of Kestrel Clay as a solvent business. This would include but not be limited to advertising, and building toward studio materials such as a raku kiln and decal printer for examples.  </p>

Our Story
Hi there, my name is Megan Jones and I am a member of the Kestrel Clay dynamic duo, along with my fiance, Chad Collins. I just completed the MFA in Illustration Practice at MICA, while Chad has an MAT from the University of Central Missouri. We are both teachers and ceramic artists based in Baltimore, MD looking to develop our business and teaching practice.  We are both dedicated artists who have recently begun expanding from private sales and limited gallery representation to small markets and festivals. 
 The Kestrel Clay Throw-Down is our way of having fun and reaching out to the wider online community. I was especially excited at how well my home town teams did this year, and Chad came up with a brilliant idea: Our own competition! We will each run an independent campaign to see who can raise the most funds toward getting us to the NCECA conference this year in Kansas City, MO. In the end, we will pool our funds together, but the winner gets bragging rights and the loser gets a bucket of muddy clay dumped on their head (with a video of course so that you can enjoy it as much as we do! Hopefully i'll be the one dumping clay on Chad's head, since again it was his ever so brilliant idea). 

What We Need & What You Get From Us!

We need $1300 bare minimum to travel to Kansas City March 16-23 to participate in NCECA's annual conference. NCECA (The National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts) is a massive gathering of the minds, with a city full of galleries and venues filled with amazing ceramic work.  This venue will give us access to international artists, organizations, residency opportunities, and vendors that will help guide us along the path of successful art entrepreneurs. It is THE conference for those in the ceramic arts to learn, share, and make new contacts.
To get there, we will need: 
$600- Round Trip Flights for two
$700- 4 day Conference Passes for two
We are fortunate enough to have family in the area, who are graciously letting us crash in our (Megan's) old bedroom. So housing for the event is free! Lucky us! 
Any additional monies raised beyond these needs will go toward the development of Kestrel Clay as a solvent business. This would include but not be limited to advertising, and building toward studio materials such as a raku kiln and decal printer for examples.  

What do you get out of this? - Based on the level of your support to either of our campaigns you will receive a unique one of a kind reward made by the artist you choose to support.  

For Supporting Team Megan you will receive: 

$1- A thank you email from both Chad and I!
$10- A hand-drawn doodle postcard that will be sent to you in the mail!
$25- A small painted tile approximately 3""x4""(I choose the animal! You tell me Anthropomorphic or Not! Then sit back and let the magic happen. Will it be a Victorian Chameleon? Or a chubby Koalo chomping on some leaves??)

$35- A Black Deer Planter (Limited to 5!)




$40- Illustrated Hanging Planter (You choose the image: Daisy, cactus, or lily pads!)




$50 - A small illustrated bottle (Your choice of animal!) Approximately 5-6"" tall





$80 - A Large illustrated bottle (Your choice of animal!) Approximately 8-9"" tall




$100- A low-relief illustrated tile, hand sculpted and painted by me! You can request a character or animal, or leave it up to my creative devices! Approximate size will be around 5""x7"" to 6""x8"" by 1/2""-1"" thick. 




$250- Custom Pet Sculpture. Sized for Table top, roughly around 8"" tall.




$250- [Baltimore Area Only] Come work in the Potters Guild with me! I'll teach you how to hand-build animals and figures in clay. This will be 6 sessions, with a finished piece at the end! Wowza!

In July 2016 artists and (entry)level explorers Simon Pruciak and Alexandra
Reddaway are departing for a year long journey around
the world on motorbikes.

The objective for the trip is to generate art work which explores the concept of
creative geographies (the relationship between
Geography and the contemporary Visual Arts)  and through participation of different social groups globally to explore this concept through arts education.
Several galleries worldwide already committed to exhibit the work.



The whole journey will be documented through
professional photography and video and the progress
will be published on regular basis through vlog, blog and
social media throughout the journey.

Upon return, alongside the exhibitions of the art work,
Simon and Alex will also publish a book (a Hamburg based
publisher has already been secured) and produce a film.

Contributors like you will help to make this project a reality.

He is a high energy, fun, boisterous character for our new line of children's books. The purpose of Gallager is to entertain children with humor and rhyme while teaching wonderful lessons about faith and God's love. This first book ""Leaving Mopertoperville"" creatively teaches a lesson on the power of forgiveness. He is perfect for grade school aged children 4 to 9 years of age. He's being brought to life through not only books and EBooks, but music cd's and downloads and of course the talking stuffed animal (plush) ""Word Power Gallager"" who speaks 20 different  life and faith affirming phrases when you press his tummy, which kids will love.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Are Asking</h3> <p>We are asking to raise $25,000 to help us build the Gallager Goose brand. We are looking to make him commercially appealing while teaching positive morals and values to young people. This campaign is to help us finalize our launch.

Through my years of writing both greeting cards and children's material, I have seen that there is a void in the world of children's entertainment that forgets to incorporate the faith based with the highly entertaining and creative (like seen in  Veggie Tales).

<p><em>L’association Krasis Orchestra organise un chantier bénévole du 17 au 28 août à Gorodka, lieu d’art insolite construit par Pierre Shasmoukine. Un lieu où écologie et art se lient étroitement depuis près de 40 ans.</em></p>
<p><em>Les objectifs de ce 
chantier sont le réaménagement des espaces, la permaculture et des 
ateliers de réflexion pour développer à nouveau des activités 
artistiques à Gorodka. <br/></em></p>
<p><em></em><em></em></p>
<p></p>
<em>
<div><div><div><div>
<span>Depuis six mois déjà, des bénévoles de l'association Krasis Orchestra interviennent à Gorodka un week-end par mois, afin de rénover et de préserver le lieu. Ces interventions ont permis à plusieurs sculptures d'extérieur de trouver une seconde jeunesse, au nettoyage de structures, et à la protection de nombreux éléments en bois. Ces actions, en plus de redonner une fraîcheur à Gorodka, s'inscrivent dans la préservation du patrimoine culturel périgourdin. Car en effet, existant depuis plus de quarante ans, Gorodka est désormais un élément essentiel de l'Histoire sarladaise, de sa culture.<br/><br/>Vous pouvez vous aussi devenir bénévole en envoyant un mail à benevoles@krasisorchestra.fr<br/></span><p></p>

<h1><strong><b><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; PERMACULTURE</span></b></strong></h1>
<p><br/></p>
<p>La <i>permaculture</i> c’est quoi ?! Littéralement ; la <i>culture permanente</i> :
 Nous pouvons cultiver la terre de telle sorte qu’elle ne s’appauvrit 
jamais. A l’inverse de l’agriculture productiviste, adepte de 
monoculture, la permaculture cherche à varier les fruits et légumes et 
use de multiples astuces comme la complémentarité des cultures afin de 
créer un cycle vertueux sans utilisation de pesticides ni d’engrais 
chimiques.</p>
<h3><strong>Pourquoi à Gorodka ?</strong></h3>
<p>Il
 y a plus de quarante ans, quand Gorodka n’était alors qu’une colline 
boisée, Pierre a commencé une activité d’éleveur et d’agriculteur afin 
d’être autonome. Son audace et son imagination lui ont permis de 
construire par la suite la fameuse serre à chaleur animale et d’être à 
la tête de <i>l’Institut Rural de l’Information</i>
 qui comptait près de quinze salariés dont les recherches étaient axées 
sur l’autogestion. Suite à la décentralisation, il ne fut plus 
subventionné par l’État et ne put plus continuer dans cette voie.</p>
<p>Gorodka écrira alors une autre page de son histoire.</p>
<p>Lorsque
 nous sommes arrivés fin décembre, il nous est apparu naturel de 
reprendre cette activité qui est, à l’heure de Monsanto et cie, un 
véritable engagement politique et citoyen.</p>
<div>
<a href=""http://krasisorchestra.fr/gorodka-le-chantier-de-krasis-orchestra-du-17-au-28-aout/shasmoukine/#main"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></a><br/><br/>
<h3><strong>Dans quel but ?</strong></h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>L’objectif
 premier est pour nous d’apprendre ce qu’est la terre et sa culture, de 
voir pousser ce que nous mangeons ailleurs que dans des surgelés 
empaquetés ou autres productions intensives. Les récoltes permettront de
 nous nourrir, mais surtout de produire des conserves en tout genre que 
nous pourrons alors vendre sur le marché, afin d’intégrer un peu plus 
Gorodka à la vie sarladaise.</p>
<p>Un
 tiers de la production sera nôtre, le deuxième tiers pour les marchés 
et le dernier pour les associations locales luttant contre la faim.</p>
<h3><strong>Comment nous allons nous y prendre ?</strong></h3>
<p>Nous
 allons notamment faire appel aux Incroyables Comestibles, mouvement 
citoyen qui s’engage pour la promotion de l’écologie. Ils nous 
expliqueront comment faire et nous préparerons ainsi le terrain. Par 
ailleurs, certains bénévoles apporteront leur expérience dans ce 
domaine-là. Cela demande du temps et de l’investissement humain pour 
construire un véritable projet de permaculture ; pour façonner le 
cercle vertueux d’une culture durable de la terre.</p>

<h3><b>La serre et les ateliers <br/></b></h3>
<p>La
 serre à chaleur animale a été construite en 1978 dans le but 
d’accueillir les animaux au sol et de récupérer la chaleur qu’ils 
génèrent afin de chauffer une serre au premier étage. Elle permettait 
ainsi une importante économie d’énergies.</p>
<p>Au
 début des années 1980 avec la décentralisation, les subventions de 
l’Etat disparaissent et l’I.R.I (voir Histoire) avec. La serre devient 
alors un atelier, mais également une sorte de grenier spacieux où sont 
entreposés un nombre incalculable d’objets en tout genre depuis une 
trentaine d’années (outils et matériaux divers, aile d’avion, etc) . 
Nous réorganiserons et ferons l’inventaire du matériel afin de faire de 
la serre un lieu de fabrication, d’expression pour les bénévoles, 
l’association et les futurs artistes en résidence.</p>

<h3><br/></h3><h3>Des Ateliers de Réflexion</h3>
<p>Au cours du chantier des bénévoles du 
17 au 28 août 2016, nous avons prévu d’aménager des temps de réflexion 
entre les bénévoles et membres de l’association ; ceci dans l’optique 
d’un projet culturel qui soit issu des idées, compétences et 
possibilités de chacun : en propre, ces ateliers auront réellement un 
fonctionnement <em>démocratique</em>. Ceci nous permettra de choisir ce 
qui est faisable en fonction des effectifs disponibles, et, par la 
richesse du collectif, de préciser les différentes idées soumises à la 
réflexion collective.</p>
<p>L’important ici, c’est – d’une part, 
de permettre à chacun des bénévoles une réflexion et un engagement 
citoyen dans le projet global de Krasis Orchestra à Gorodka, chacun 
pouvant apporter ses idées, ses projets, et son regard singulier – et 
d’autre part, de confronter les points de vue sur des sujets différents 
(thématiques philosophiques, esthétiques, politiques, mais aussi sur la 
permaculture, l’utilisation des espaces…) en vue de rendre plus efficace
 notre action à Gorodka.</p>
<h3>L’Archivage des ressources</h3>
<p>Gorodka est un lieu où fourmille une 
quantité étonnante de ressources en tous genres : des textes sur les 
cultures durables, des ouvrages sur l’art et la peinture, des archives 
sur l’histoire du lieu, et un grand nombre de disques vinyles et CD 
quasiment introuvables actuellement.</p>
<p>Le chantier de cet été sera donc 
l’occasion de recenser, d’archiver et de rendre disponibles tous ces 
documents, afin qu’ils puissent être utiles au public du lieu.</p>

numériser pour créer une grande banque de données textuelles et 
musicales accessibles au public.</p>
<h3>La Création</h3>
<p>Gorodka, c’est aussi un lieu de 
création, au même titre qu’un lieu de permaculture. Si Pierre 
Shasmoukine y a conçu un nombre impressionnant d’oeuvres au cours des 
quarante dernières années, beaucoup d’artistes s’y sont succédé : lors 
de résidences, d’expositions temporaires, de concerts et autres 
événements. Nous souhaitons que cela perdure pour plusieurs raisons : 
l’expression artistique libre est un marqueur essentiel d’une société 
démocratique, et elle permet à la fois la mise en relation des

<h1><strong><b><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; PERMACULTURE</span></b></strong></h1>
<p>What is permaculture?! In a
 literal sense, it is indeed ‘a permanent culture’ – a way of 
cultivating the earth that is truly sustainable, without draining it of 
its own resources. In contrast to production-oriented agriculture, and 
its espousal of monoculture, permaculture strives to vary fruits and 
vegetables through diverse strategies, focusing for instance on the 
compatibility of cultures to promote a virtuous cycle without the use of
 pesticides and artificial fertilizers.</p>
<h3><u>Why Gorodka?</u></h3>
<p><br/>
Over forty years ago, when Gorodka was but a forested hill, Pierre began
 livestock farming and harvesting in the aim of becoming entirely 
self-sufficient. His audacity and imagination gave him the possibility 
to build the famed animal-heated greenhouse and direct the <i>Rural Institute of Information</i>,
 a workforce of fifteen salaried researchers dedicated to the question 
of self-governance. Following an intense period of decentralization, 
government subsidies were pulled and marked the end of this particular 
prospect. </p>
<p>Gorodka thus wrote another page of its life story.</p>
<p>Upon our arrival at the end
 of December, it seemed natural for us to recover this project, which, 
amidst the reign of Monsanto, is a welcome opportunity for true 
political and civic engagement.</p>

<h3><u>To what end?</u></h3>
<p>The primary objective was 
for us to learn about cultivation, to witness with our own eyes the 
growth of what we ingest outside the confines of deep-freezer packaged 
dinners and other intensive productions. The harvest will serve our 
immediate nutrition, but is also suitable for a variety of canned foods,
 which we can sell at the market, further integrating Gorodka into the 
Sarlat community.</p>
<p>A third of the harvest will
 stay with us, a third will be destined for market sale, and the 
remaining third will be donated to local food banks.</p>
<h3><u>How will we achieve this?</u></h3>
<p>Our first stop will be <i>Incroyables Comestibles</i>,
 a grass-roots movement that promotes ecology. They will assist us with 
the know-how, and we will thus allow us to prepare the terrain. In 
addition, several volunteers have developed skills and experience in the
 field to share. There is a sizeable amount of time and human investment
 required to construct a project of sustainable permaculture, to mould a
 virtuous cycle of durable cultivation. </p>

 animal-heated greenhouse was built in 1978 with the purpose of housing 
animals on the ground floor, and using the heat they generate to create a
 greenhouse for the floor above, thus allowing for a substantial 
conservation of energy.</p>
<p>The start of the eighties 
signaled a wave of decentralization and the disappearance of government 
subsidies. The Rural Institute of Information, created at Gorodka, was 
but one casualty. The greenhouse thus became a workshop, as well as a 
kind of spacious warehouse for a cornucopia of miscellaneous objects 
over the last three decades. Tools, various materials, and airplane 
wings can be found. Our aim is to reorganize this space and draft an 
inventory of the materials found. We hope to subsquently transform this 
warehouse into a space for artistic production, be it for our 
volunteers, the association, or future artists in residence.</p>
<h3><u>Gallery Za Outbuilding</u></h3><u>
</u><p>Bordered by the forest, 
Gallery Za is an abandoned apartment with a cellar that will most likely
 become a rehearsal space for future bands in residency. Once inside, an
 extensive archive of Gorodka can be found. Weakened by years of neglect
 and humidity, the majority of the works are beyond repair. Nonetheless,
 one can still discover objects intact, such as a reproduction of a 
piece by Jarki – belonging to the space, it will remain once it has been
 renovated. We will recuperate the archives that are in good shape and 
will make a digitized count of the works.</p>

<p>During ten days, we will 
thus select which will be kept and which will be discarded; 
Récup’acteurs de Viallard, a local organization dedicated to this exact 
task, will then retrieve these articles and rework them into use.</p>
<h1><b><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; Cultural Action</span></b></h1>
<h3><u>Thought Workshops</u></h3>
<p>During our volunteer week from the 17<sup>th</sup> to the 28<sup>th</sup>
 of August 2016, we opt to foster reflections between the volunteers and
 members of the association; this is in the perspective of a cultural 
project, birthed from the ideas, abilities, and possibilities of each 
participant. Formally put, these workshops hope to embody a truly 
democratic process. This will allow us to determine what is possible 
with the present group, and by nature of the collective, to further 
precise the different ideas presented for communal reflection.</p>
<p>What is important is this –
 on one hand, allowing for each volunteer to reflect and freely engage 
themselves within Krasis Orchestra’s global project at Gorodka, each 
offering their ideas, projects, and unique perspectives. On the other 
hand, to confront the various points of view on a variety of topics 
(philosophy, aesthetics, politics, permaculture, opinions on the 
potential usage of the space…) in order to render our action at Gorodka 
that much more effective.</p>
<h3><u>An archive of resources</u></h3>
<p><a href=""http://krasisorchestra.fr/gorodka-le-chantier-de-krasis-orchestra-du-17-au-28-aout/numerisation/#main"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>Gorodka is teeming with a 
surprising amount of resources of varying genres: texts on durable 
culture, literature on art and painting, historical archives of the 
space itself, and a haul of rare vinyl records and cd’s, almost out of 
grasp nowadays.</p>
<p>This summer’s workshop will therefore aim to identify, archive, and render all these valuable documents available to the public.</p>
<p>Volunteers will therefore 
work on generating a digital record of these items to create a large 
textual and musical database for the public at large.</p>
<h3><u>Creation</u></h3>
<p>Notwithstanding its 
commitment to permaculture, Gorodka is a space dedicated to fostering 
the creative spirit. While Pierre Shasmoukine has produced an 
impressionable number of his works on site, many other artists have 
followed suit, during residencies, temporary exhibits, concerts and 
other events. Our wish is for this to continue for a number of reasons: 
free artistic expression is an essential marker for a democratic 
society, and allows for the convergence of different subjectivities, as 
well as a sensorial and perceptual exercise for participants.</p>
<p><i>‘(…) Art as a whole is 
not a vain creation of object that are lost in emptiness, but a force 
that has an end and must serve the development and refinement of the 
human soul’. </i></p>
<p>Kandinsky</p>
<p>In this perspective, the 
workshops are an opportunity for volunteers and members of the 
association to propose different creative projects; be it through 
performance, art, musical residencies.</p>
<h1><b><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; Food Provisions</span></b></h1>
<p>Providing meals will take 
the largest bite out of our budget for the upcoming volunteer week in 
August. Indeed, providing for thirty people during ten days quickly adds
 up – we are estimating a maximum of 2000 euros.</p>
<p>This estimation is based on
 research done on both large-scale and smaller food distributors. We 
have chosen to base our estimate on Leclerc’s prices, which are steeper 
but more stable.</p>
<p>However, we won’t be buying anything there:</p>
<p>As our project is 
axed on permaculture, it is clear that we will be supporting local 
farmers, whose produce may not be certified organic, but grown in an 
environmentally respectful way. Their contacts were sent our way by <i>Incroyables Comestibles</i>, an association dedicated to ecology.</p>
<p>Should you have any 
questions on the menu our minds and bellies have long ruminated upon, 
with the aim of providing a variety of flavors for each participant, you
 can send us an email at <span><u><a href=""mailto:benevoles@krasisorchestra.fr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">benevoles@krasisorchestra.fr</a></u></span></p>
<p>A vegetarian option will be offered for every meal.</p>
<p>If left-overs occur, that 
which we cannot conserve will be either donated to food banks, or 
destined to producing top-notch compost!</p>

L’association Krasis Orchestra organise un chantier bénévole du 17 au 28 août à Gorodka, lieu d’art insolite construit par Pierre Shasmoukine. Un lieu où écologie et art se lient étroitement depuis près de 40 ans.
Les objectifs de ce 
chantier sont le réaménagement des espaces, la permaculture et des 
ateliers de réflexion pour développer à nouveau des activités 
artistiques à Gorodka. 




Depuis six mois déjà, des bénévoles de l'association Krasis Orchestra interviennent à Gorodka un week-end par mois, afin de rénover et de préserver le lieu. Ces interventions ont permis à plusieurs sculptures d'extérieur de trouver une seconde jeunesse, au nettoyage de structures, et à la protection de nombreux éléments en bois. Ces actions, en plus de redonner une fraîcheur à Gorodka, s'inscrivent dans la préservation du patrimoine culturel périgourdin. Car en effet, existant depuis plus de quarante ans, Gorodka est désormais un élément essentiel de l'Histoire sarladaise, de sa culture.Vous pouvez vous aussi devenir bénévole en envoyant un mail à benevoles@krasisorchestra.fr









>>> PERMACULTURE

La permaculture c’est quoi ?! Littéralement ; la culture permanente :
 Nous pouvons cultiver la terre de telle sorte qu’elle ne s’appauvrit 
jamais. A l’inverse de l’agriculture productiviste, adepte de 
monoculture, la permaculture cherche à varier les fruits et légumes et 
use de multiples astuces comme la complémentarité des cultures afin de 
créer un cycle vertueux sans utilisation de pesticides ni d’engrais 
chimiques.
Pourquoi à Gorodka ?
Il
 y a plus de quarante ans, quand Gorodka n’était alors qu’une colline 
boisée, Pierre a commencé une activité d’éleveur et d’agriculteur afin 
d’être autonome. Son audace et son imagination lui ont permis de 
construire par la suite la fameuse serre à chaleur animale et d’être à 
la tête de l’Institut Rural de l’Information
 qui comptait près de quinze salariés dont les recherches étaient axées 
sur l’autogestion. Suite à la décentralisation, il ne fut plus 
subventionné par l’État et ne put plus continuer dans cette voie.
Gorodka écrira alors une autre page de son histoire.
Lorsque
 nous sommes arrivés fin décembre, il nous est apparu naturel de 
reprendre cette activité qui est, à l’heure de Monsanto et cie, un 
véritable engagement politique et citoyen.


Dans quel but ?

L’objectif
 premier est pour nous d’apprendre ce qu’est la terre et sa culture, de 
voir pousser ce que nous mangeons ailleurs que dans des surgelés 
empaquetés ou autres productions intensives. Les récoltes permettront de
 nous nourrir, mais surtout de produire des conserves en tout genre que 
nous pourrons alors vendre sur le marché, afin d’intégrer un peu plus 
Gorodka à la vie sarladaise.
Un
 tiers de la production sera nôtre, le deuxième tiers pour les marchés 
et le dernier pour les associations locales luttant contre la faim.
Comment nous allons nous y prendre ?
Nous
 allons notamment faire appel aux Incroyables Comestibles, mouvement 
citoyen qui s’engage pour la promotion de l’écologie. Ils nous 
expliqueront comment faire et nous préparerons ainsi le terrain. Par 
ailleurs, certains bénévoles apporteront leur expérience dans ce 
domaine-là. Cela demande du temps et de l’investissement humain pour 
construire un véritable projet de permaculture ; pour façonner le 
cercle vertueux d’une culture durable de la terre.





>>> RÉNOVATION DES ŒUVRES ET RÉAMÉNAGEMENT DES ESPACES




La serre et les ateliers 
La
 serre à chaleur animale a été construite en 1978 dans le but 
d’accueillir les animaux au sol et de récupérer la chaleur qu’ils 
génèrent afin de chauffer une serre au premier étage. Elle permettait 
ainsi une importante économie d’énergies.
Au
 début des années 1980 avec la décentralisation, les subventions de 
l’Etat disparaissent et l’I.R.I (voir Histoire) avec. La serre devient 
alors un atelier, mais également une sorte de grenier spacieux où sont 
entreposés un nombre incalculable d’objets en tout genre depuis une 
trentaine d’années (outils et matériaux divers, aile d’avion, etc) . 
Nous réorganiserons et ferons l’inventaire du matériel afin de faire de 
la serre un lieu de fabrication, d’expression pour les bénévoles, 
l’association et les futurs artistes en résidence.

 La dépendance de la galerie Za
Près de la forêt, c’est un 
appartement abandonné où se situe une cave qui servira très certainement
 de lieu de répétitions pour les futurs groupes en résidence. Il y a 
dans cette cave beaucoup d’archives de Gorodka. Malheureusement, avec le
 temps et l’humidité, la majorité d’entre elles sont inexploitables. 
Cependant, nous trouvons parfois des objets intacts tels que cette 
reproduction – appartenant au lieu, elle y restera une fois le lieu 
rénové. Nous récupérerons les archives récupérables et les numériserons.

animals on the ground floor, and using the heat they generate to create a
 greenhouse for the floor above, thus allowing for a substantial 
conservation of energy.
The start of the eighties 
signaled a wave of decentralization and the disappearance of government 
subsidies. The Rural Institute of Information, created at Gorodka, was 
but one casualty. The greenhouse thus became a workshop, as well as a 
kind of spacious warehouse for a cornucopia of miscellaneous objects 
over the last three decades. Tools, various materials, and airplane 
wings can be found. Our aim is to reorganize this space and draft an 
inventory of the materials found. We hope to subsquently transform this 
warehouse into a space for artistic production, be it for our 
volunteers, the association, or future artists in residence.
Gallery Za Outbuilding
Bordered by the forest, 
Gallery Za is an abandoned apartment with a cellar that will most likely
 become a rehearsal space for future bands in residency. Once inside, an
 extensive archive of Gorodka can be found. Weakened by years of neglect
 and humidity, the majority of the works are beyond repair. Nonetheless,
 one can still discover objects intact, such as a reproduction of a 
piece by Jarki – belonging to the space, it will remain once it has been
 renovated. We will recuperate the archives that are in good shape and 
will make a digitized count of the works.

During ten days, we will 
thus select which will be kept and which will be discarded; 
Récup’acteurs de Viallard, a local organization dedicated to this exact 
task, will then retrieve these articles and rework them into use.
>>> Cultural Action
Thought Workshops
During our volunteer week from the 17th to the 28th
 of August 2016, we opt to foster reflections between the volunteers and
 members of the association; this is in the perspective of a cultural 
project, birthed from the ideas, abilities, and possibilities of each 
participant. Formally put, these workshops hope to embody a truly 
democratic process. This will allow us to determine what is possible 
with the present group, and by nature of the collective, to further 
precise the different ideas presented for communal reflection.
What is important is this –
 on one hand, allowing for each volunteer to reflect and freely engage 
themselves within Krasis Orchestra’s global project at Gorodka, each 
offering their ideas, projects, and unique perspectives. On the other 
hand, to confront the various points of view on a variety of topics 
(philosophy, aesthetics, politics, permaculture, opinions on the 
potential usage of the space…) in order to render our action at Gorodka 
that much more effective.
An archive of resources

Gorodka is teeming with a 
surprising amount of resources of varying genres: texts on durable 
culture, literature on art and painting, historical archives of the 
space itself, and a haul of rare vinyl records and cd’s, almost out of 
grasp nowadays.
This summer’s workshop will therefore aim to identify, archive, and render all these valuable documents available to the public.
Volunteers will therefore 
work on generating a digital record of these items to create a large 
textual and musical database for the public at large.
Creation
Notwithstanding its 
commitment to permaculture, Gorodka is a space dedicated to fostering 
the creative spirit. While Pierre Shasmoukine has produced an 
impressionable number of his works on site, many other artists have 
followed suit, during residencies, temporary exhibits, concerts and 
other events. Our wish is for this to continue for a number of reasons: 
free artistic expression is an essential marker for a democratic 
society, and allows for the convergence of different subjectivities, as 
well as a sensorial and perceptual exercise for participants.
‘(…) Art as a whole is 
not a vain creation of object that are lost in emptiness, but a force 
that has an end and must serve the development and refinement of the 
human soul’. 
Kandinsky
In this perspective, the 
workshops are an opportunity for volunteers and members of the 
association to propose different creative projects; be it through 
performance, art, musical residencies.
>>> Food Provisions
Providing meals will take 
the largest bite out of our budget for the upcoming volunteer week in 
August. Indeed, providing for thirty people during ten days quickly adds
 up – we are estimating a maximum of 2000 euros.
This estimation is based on
 research done on both large-scale and smaller food distributors. We 
have chosen to base our estimate on Leclerc’s prices, which are steeper 
but more stable.
However, we won’t be buying anything there:
As our project is 
axed on permaculture, it is clear that we will be supporting local 
farmers, whose produce may not be certified organic, but grown in an 
environmentally respectful way. Their contacts were sent our way by Incroyables Comestibles, an association dedicated to ecology.
Should you have any 
questions on the menu our minds and bellies have long ruminated upon, 
with the aim of providing a variety of flavors for each participant, you
 can send us an email at benevoles@krasisorchestra.fr
A vegetarian option will be offered for every meal.
If left-overs occur, that 
which we cannot conserve will be either donated to food banks, or 
destined to producing top-notch compost!

<h3><i>Everything I Say Is True</i></h3>
<p>My name is Suzanne Kite and I am an Indigenous artist who practices under the name Kite. I am a composer and performer.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am raising money to perform my current project in Los Angeles, CA: <i>Everything I Say Is True</i> (2017) commissioned by Walter Phillips Gallery, Banff Centre.</li>
<li>This piece will be shown in in Banff, Canada, and in various stages in Los Angeles, CA, Portland, OR, Melbourne &amp; Sydney, Australia, and New York. </li>
<li>This piece is an exploration of ""truth"" and ""belief"" in Western thinking versus Lakota thinking, which is increasingly relevant today.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What Is Needed</h3>
<p>I need around $3000 to finish this project</p>
<ul>
<li>This will primarily go to building a new computer that can comfortably run Processing, Ableton, and output to 5 projectors at once (which I have done for every performance, but to the detriment of the piece).</li>
<li>New sound card (that doesn't output random noise)</li>
<li>Help fund paying amazing musicians for a live performance of the score in LA</li>
<li>Contributing musicians: Doug Carter, Jessika Kenney, Eyvind Kang, Crystal Torres, Jackie Urlick, Matthew Allen, Matthew Hunter, Oscar Santos, Mint Park, Devin Ronneberg</li>

<ul>
<li>I put everything I have into my work: time, money, energy, because I believe artwork by Indigenous people, exploring concepts of time and truth, critically analyzing Western concepts, are all essential to the preservation of my people and all peoples.</li>
<li>My previous projects, People You Must Look at Me, Lecture on Two Locations, and Sources have been successfully performed and exhibited in Canada and Los Angeles over the past two years and I am very excited to share this next piece.</li>

It is a long chain of events, a story, that can be traced through family documents, historical documents, maps, data, misinformation, lies, conspiracy, imagination, and dreams. The culture of conspiracy in the United States continually touches on Indians. Conspiracy requires an enemy with a preconceived plot, destiny, however, is the fulfillment of a natural order. Most importantly, destiny requires a beginning point and an end point: linear time. In this performance and installation, I would like to propose that the ""responsible truth"" is the disbelief in linear time. I see these many timelines has existing constantly in the present, with my personal timeline as a result of other timelines, especially COINTELPRO, which targeted the Black Power and American Indian Movements. I see my own birth as part of a web of events alongside COINTELPRO's involvement in the violence on Pine Ridge, decisions made by generations of Oglala, Lakota cosmologies, and time itself. Describing the paranoia of the American 1990s, media critic Jesse Walker states, ""the mythologies of one group flowed freely into another’s, even as radically different styles of conspiracism contended"".

<p>Once a year, 70,000 people gather in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada to create the city of Black Rock City, a temporary metropolis dedicated to community, art, self-expression and self-confidence. In this infinite of creativity, and everyone is welcome</p>

<p>There are no spectators - everyone is invited to participate</p>
<p>If you believe that just by purchasing the ticket will guarantee your participation in the event, you can forget. This is not a festival. The temporary city only works with the participation of all the people as volunteers: be it constructing an art installation, setting up a camp, working in 2 or 3 days taking on tasks like: cooking, serving in the bar of your camp, recycling the garbage and helping people actively, every day, all the time.</p>
<p>CARNIVAL WHY?</p>
<p>WHEN WE GO TO THE PLAYA, we want to offer our best, and the best experiences to people who choose to go to the desert. And what could be better than offering the experience of a carnaval bloco from the streets of Rio de Janeiro through the streets of Black Rock City ????</p>
<p>The idea here is to have a carnival band that will be passing through the streets of the PLAYA inviting who is along the way to feel our vibe of Rio de Janeiro carnival.</p>
<p>We have musicians from Rio, SP, Curitiba, who want to go and offer what they have the best there, but as we all know the reality of musicians does not match the costs to get there, so we ask for your SUPPORT to make our dream come true .</p>

<p>I am Enea Guzja a self taught young artist currently based in Athens. Recently I sent an application from at the XII Florence Biennale, and I was happily informed that I am one of the selected participating artists. Therefore being a part of XII FB is a huge thing because I have lots of influence from Italy and especially from the Florentine Renaissance.

<p>The cost of the whole thing is approximately 4400€.

<p>For your kind help, I will provide you special perks such as digital prints of selected works, others of your choice and more.</p>
<p>In case that the campaign is unsuccessful, I will put all my effort to find the remaining money by myself, so that I won't lose this once in a lifetime chance. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if the campaign succeeds not only I will make a big step to my artistic career, but I will also be able to show the world, that art is for everyone and only for those who can afford it.

<p>Hi, I am David Voorhees, an artist from Western North Carolina. I've been making
pottery since 1975 and built my wood-fired car kiln in 2009.  After 22
firings it became apparent that some structural problems required the
rebuilding of the firebox section.  I am now fundraising to help pay for the four-month reconstruction project which has recently been completed. </p>
<p>My unusual kiln draws design components
from historical kilns and industrial applications and is one of a small handful of
wood-fired car kilns in the world. I use waste wood from local sawmills to fuel the
kiln. Each firing lasts 24 to 30 hours, using 1 1/2 cords of wood and requires several helpers to prepare
and fire.  I have hosted about 40 regional potters and sculptors as firing
participants over the years. An added feature of my kiln is the built-in pizza
oven which insures plenty of helpers from the community.</p>
<p>With a well-studied firebox redesign, I
have used all new high-heat duty bricks in hot face areas and reused any old bricks where
appropriate.  Funding will help pay for these new bricks and steel and welding
costs.  I have applied for a local arts grant to fund new kiln shelves to make the
project complete.  The original kiln was entirely self-funded at around
$10,000.</p>
<p>With my wood-fired kiln back in operation I

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Hi, I am David Voorhees, an artist from Western North Carolina. I've been making
pottery since 1975 and built my wood-fired car kiln in 2009.  After 22
firings it became apparent that some structural problems required the
rebuilding of the firebox section.  I am now fundraising to help pay for the four-month reconstruction project which has recently been completed. 
My unusual kiln draws design components
from historical kilns and industrial applications and is one of a small handful of
wood-fired car kilns in the world. I use waste wood from local sawmills to fuel the
kiln. Each firing lasts 24 to 30 hours, using 1 1/2 cords of wood and requires several helpers to prepare
and fire.  I have hosted about 40 regional potters and sculptors as firing
participants over the years. An added feature of my kiln is the built-in pizza
oven which insures plenty of helpers from the community.
With a well-studied firebox redesign, I
have used all new high-heat duty bricks in hot face areas and reused any old bricks where
appropriate.  Funding will help pay for these new bricks and steel and welding
costs.  I have applied for a local arts grant to fund new kiln shelves to make the
project complete.  The original kiln was entirely self-funded at around
$10,000.
With my wood-fired kiln back in operation I
can get back to doing what I love and that is making pottery!  This kiln
gives excellent results that only wood firing and soda glazing can do, imparting the marks and path of the flame and fly ash.  I am excited to see
what new creations will be coming from each firing in the future and know that more regional artists will benefit as well from the community aspect of my kiln. A ""shakedown"" firing has been completed recently with good results, so I'm ready to get firing again!
The original kiln construction is documented on my website and is available to the public. I plan to make the reconstruction images available as well, hopefully being of use to other potters considering a trolley version for their wood-fired kiln plans.
I hope you can help with funding; please
check out the perks I am offering, many of the pots coming out of the first few firings of

<p>It was many-a-moon of paint and foam dust on the hands of Marti and Trev that kicked it all off. It was hours of cultivating the ideas, approaches and making sure the core ethics were strong and steadfast. A partnership soon formed with Blake Combrinck, owner of the exciting Knext Gallery in Cape Town CBD where we then hosted a Drink&amp;Draw.  This saw some of Cape Town's strongest visually creative talent in the same room, making things. Since then we have already commissioned 8 artists (in our first month) and  have come to the moment to put out a <strong>call to action and contribution in exchange for beautiful artworks and merchandise</strong> This involves <strong>YOU</strong>, lovely worldly beings. We believe in this idea and believe you will too. The potential is infinite and the intent is wholesome. Please take a few minutes to read below. </p>
<p>The dude's name above is Marti Lund. He is a street artist, oil painter, community muralist coordinator and more recently, surfboard artist.From that passion he founded MAAKboards,  a surfboard label aimed at making a strong move in unifying the Cape Town creative community, to create artwork commissions for artists towards beautiful functional artboards. He saw it as potential to run future outreach programs, a mode of unifying an incredibly diverse and exciting creative community together through a unique collective creative event, now named the Drink&amp;Draw.</p>

<div><p>Thi campaign is aimed at raiding funds to kick off our business, get our boards into the right places, build a website and get artists painting boards in order to solidify the family. When this ball is in full-roll, we're going to be affecting and helping grow the careers of a range of artists. With this in mind, we've focussed on the art, on getting artist's designs and artwork out there. The campaign itself simply functions as an art auction, with the flare and added intricacy of surfboards</p></div>

<p>In essence, you'll be contributing to a drastic shift in the lives of many creatives.MAAkboards will affect many people, from the people making the boards to the people who get to ride them globally. The concept allows for the expansion of a unique community, to bring in artists, create exposure, a solid revenue stream and surfboards that only dreams could create. The community, which includes artists and buyers of the boards, will benefit from ongoing social media updates of the travels of the boards, building a creative, open platform for contributions of writing, poetry, photography and artworks. It is all about creativity and is able to be expanded to a point of real, effective inclusivity. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496312863/mwtfpwjlapimuhrrvubk.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496311724/untssgqanbuimg0wzpxr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Since then we have already commissioned 8 artists (in our first month) and  have come to the moment to put out a call to action and contribution in exchange for beautiful artworks and merchandise This involves YOU, lovely worldly beings. We believe in this idea and believe you will too. The potential is infinite and the intent is wholesome. Please take a few minutes to read below. 
The dude's name above is Marti Lund. He is a street artist, oil painter, community muralist coordinator and more recently, surfboard artist.From that passion he founded MAAKboards,  a surfboard label aimed at making a strong move in unifying the Cape Town creative community, to create artwork commissions for artists towards beautiful functional artboards. He saw it as potential to run future outreach programs, a mode of unifying an incredibly diverse and exciting creative community together through a unique collective creative event, now named the Drink&Draw.
 


The perks start with 6 custom made artboards, shaped by our top-notch shaper Trev Minny and painted by our first 5 artists painting under the MAAKboards label.
A range of 30 original small artworks, contributed works from artists and a limited edition print series of the works made by a group of artists at our first Drink&Draw event.
Custom board bags made by our main collaborator Alice.D.  
Custom designed and printed t-shirts made by a selection of our artists. A range of smaller merchandise such badges, pendants and stickers. 



Thi campaign is aimed at raiding funds to kick off our business, get our boards into the right places, build a website and get artists painting boards in order to solidify the family. When this ball is in full-roll, we're going to be affecting and helping grow the careers of a range of artists. With this in mind, we've focussed on the art, on getting artist's designs and artwork out there. The campaign itself simply functions as an art auction, with the flare and added intricacy of surfboards
We need R200 000 or $16000
In essence, you'll be contributing to a drastic shift in the lives of many creatives.MAAkboards will affect many people, from the people making the boards to the people who get to ride them globally. The concept allows for the expansion of a unique community, to bring in artists, create exposure, a solid revenue stream and surfboards that only dreams could create. The community, which includes artists and buyers of the boards, will benefit from ongoing social media updates of the travels of the boards, building a creative, open platform for contributions of writing, poetry, photography and artworks. It is all about creativity and is able to be expanded to a point of real, effective inclusivity. 
Marti Lund is an artist based in Cape Town who is known for naturalistic street art, oil paintings, surfboard art and community mural projects. He has been working full time as an artist for 4 years and has conducted and facilitated many inclusive community based projects with NGO's and schools from Zambia to South Africa. He will soon be doing the same in Bali, Indonesia as an artist in residency. 

Trevor Minny is a surfboard shaper from Kommetjie, Cape Town. He has been shaping boards for 9 years, having worked alongside and under Dave Van Ginkel and Anton Butler from DVG and Ferral Surfboards. With a team of riders riding for him and a steady output of boards, he has become a well known name in Cape Town's surf scene. 

Blake Combrinck is the founder of Knext Gallery in Harrington Street,Cape Town. A gallery that aims to empower artists, he is focused on finding the hidden creative talents of the city and allowing them a space to showcase their work. Knext Gallery is the home of non-pretentiousness in Cape Towns oft pretentious artworld, where value is given where it is due and strong work is considered with humility and compassion.  This is his creation.

I trace the path of power in order to propose alternate flows that disrupt current hierarchies held in place by social, economic, and sexual norms.</p><p>I draw attention to these norms—which are really just collective ruts—so that together, we can dig ourselves out by changing the structure of our interactions. From running a Femme Gaze Fotobooth at the Hammer Museum in which participants become another prop to be arranged and photographed, to trading artists a piece of their work for a fantasy fulfillment experience, my work creates cracks in the social facade whereby new relational possibilities can emerge. Since power lives <i>between</i> bodies and entities, my work is located in this in-between space, augmenting everyday situations using play, negotiation, and consent.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518375878/ltacqgls7flhx4v0n0af.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: right;""><i>My visiting artist ""lecture"" at Pomona College, Claremont, CA (2015)</i></p><h2 dir=""ltr""> </h2><h2 dir=""ltr""><strong><strong><u>WHO IS LADYSCUMBAG?</u></strong></strong></h2><p>As many folks are already aware, femmes circulating in the world face a slew of frustrating inequities simply because of the position we occupy.  Harassment, objectification, insolence—this is the shit with which we consistently tango, so it's no surprise that we are exhausted by these seemingly relentless daily confrontations.<br/><br/><strong>But what if we can produce our own privilege? </strong>Is it possible to transform the very qualities that are used by the hegemonic, misogynistic patriarchy to hold us down--our feminine presentation, our sexuality, our perceived demureness and incompetence—into weapons of mass destruction? Is it possible to break the glass ceiling one stiletto heel at a time?<br/><br/><strong>These is what the LADYSCUMBAG archetype is all about.</strong> By simultaneously harnessing the codes of femininity while disregarding others’ judgments of Her character, LADYSCUMBAG (LSB) can operate as a secret agent, a Trojan horse that works towards the destruction of the powers that be. As a counterfeit basic bitch: LSB is crass, self-interested, and grimy on the inside. She puts Herself first, using her well-honed—if undisguised—feminine wiles to suck the resources out of unsuspecting bros and other human accessories that lay in her path. Adapting her tone to fit the situation at hand, LSB is a lady first but definitely not foremost. Amoral, not immoral, She’ll drink your beer and then piss in your lawn. Her motives are not fueled by vindictiveness or cruelty—rather her superpower stems from a blatant disregard of others’ perceptions and judgments of Her character. Utilizing desire as the path of least resistance, She is Her Own protagonist.</p><div>Always committed to finding the morsel of (self)interest in any situation, LADYSCUMBAG is a boat that produces Her Own rising tide. But for this rising tide to wash away the bullshit on the shore, LSBs need to work in tandem, scheming with one another in plain sight...<div>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">First, of course, there is the LADYSCUMBAG.com site, which I am soliciting content for starting in my own community. Having sent out nearly 200 individual emails to a diverse group of artists, writers, childhood friends, past coworkers, and recreational sports teammates, the enthusiasm of responses I’ve received has been overwhelmingly enthusiastic and inspiring.  With over 40 people (and counting!) already committed to contributing to LADYSCUMBAG’s (LSB’s) online presence, I am asking for your help to raise funds to <strong>pay our contributors</strong>. While I’m not here to wax poetic on the gender pay gap or the (emotional) labor that women and femmes already do for free, I am here to lead by example.  In offering an honorarium to those who take the initiative to share their lived experiences for our collective benefit, this LSB is inviting you to help model the ethic we hope to see in the world.</p>

<h2><strong><u>THE IMPACT</u></strong></h2>
<p>The LADYSCUMBAG project is, at its core, a seedling with the potential of creating social change through personal and collective empowerment.

Is there a LSB in all of us?</p>
<p>If so, if you see the (latent) LADYSCUMBAG within yourself or in the eyes of the femmes you love, please help coax her out of her shell by donating to this cause. With every dollar, you are watering and fertilizing the seedling, showing her that there is a hunger for her self-possession, prowess, and unapologetically powerful femme-ness in this world.</p>

</div></div></div></div></div>","WHO AM I?Hi,My name is Kim Ye. As a Chinese-born American, I was raised in Illinois, and have been living and working in Los Angeles for the past 10 years. As an interdisciplinary artist, I’ve exhibited my work nationally and internationally, and I use all the tools I have at hand to draw attention to the circulation of power. I trace the path of power in order to propose alternate flows that disrupt current hierarchies held in place by social, economic, and sexual norms.I draw attention to these norms—which are really just collective ruts—so that together, we can dig ourselves out by changing the structure of our interactions. From running a Femme Gaze Fotobooth at the Hammer Museum in which participants become another prop to be arranged and photographed, to trading artists a piece of their work for a fantasy fulfillment experience, my work creates cracks in the social facade whereby new relational possibilities can emerge. Since power lives between bodies and entities, my work is located in this in-between space, augmenting everyday situations using play, negotiation, and consent.My visiting artist ""lecture"" at Pomona College, Claremont, CA (2015) WHO IS LADYSCUMBAG?As many folks are already aware, femmes circulating in the world face a slew of frustrating inequities simply because of the position we occupy.  Harassment, objectification, insolence—this is the shit with which we consistently tango, so it's no surprise that we are exhausted by these seemingly relentless daily confrontations.But what if we can produce our own privilege? Is it possible to transform the very qualities that are used by the hegemonic, misogynistic patriarchy to hold us down--our feminine presentation, our sexuality, our perceived demureness and incompetence—into weapons of mass destruction? Is it possible to break the glass ceiling one stiletto heel at a time?These is what the LADYSCUMBAG archetype is all about. By simultaneously harnessing the codes of femininity while disregarding others’ judgments of Her character, LADYSCUMBAG (LSB) can operate as a secret agent, a Trojan horse that works towards the destruction of the powers that be. As a counterfeit basic bitch: LSB is crass, self-interested, and grimy on the inside. She puts Herself first, using her well-honed—if undisguised—feminine wiles to suck the resources out of unsuspecting bros and other human accessories that lay in her path. Adapting her tone to fit the situation at hand, LSB is a lady first but definitely not foremost. Amoral, not immoral, She’ll drink your beer and then piss in your lawn. Her motives are not fueled by vindictiveness or cruelty—rather her superpower stems from a blatant disregard of others’ perceptions and judgments of Her character. Utilizing desire as the path of least resistance, She is Her Own protagonist.Always committed to finding the morsel of (self)interest in any situation, LADYSCUMBAG is a boat that produces Her Own rising tide. But for this rising tide to wash away the bullshit on the shore, LSBs need to work in tandem, scheming with one another in plain sight...
 


 

 
WHAT WE NEED
As an archetype, LADYSCUMBAG is much, much bigger than me, which is why I’m asking for your help. I'm raising funds for this project, which has a both exists online and IRL as:

www.LADYSCUMBAG.com 
LADYSCUMBAG art show (LA)


Paying contributors

First, of course, there is the LADYSCUMBAG.com site, which I am soliciting content for starting in my own community. Having sent out nearly 200 individual emails to a diverse group of artists, writers, childhood friends, past coworkers, and recreational sports teammates, the enthusiasm of responses I’ve received has been overwhelmingly enthusiastic and inspiring.  With over 40 people (and counting!) already committed to contributing to LADYSCUMBAG’s (LSB’s) online presence, I am asking for your help to raise funds to pay our contributors. While I’m not here to wax poetic on the gender pay gap or the (emotional) labor that women and femmes already do for free, I am here to lead by example.  In offering an honorarium to those who take the initiative to share their lived experiences for our collective benefit, this LSB is inviting you to help model the ethic we hope to see in the world.

Paying for materials 
Secondly, there is the physical art exhibit that will take place over a 5-week period at Visitor Welcome Center (VWC)—an artist-run space in Los Angeles with a history of championing the work of queer, POC, and women artists. For the duration of the LSB show, the space will be turned into an immersive and interactive installation, where visitors can participate in the production and propagation of the LSB archetype. Schooling gallery-goers in the feminine arts, I will be offering visitors the opportunity to embroider their own LSB utility bags (every femme needs an emergency kit), sew their own panties, and do their own makeup for superior selfie potential. While I will be holding office hours during gallery hours to help, instruct, and dialogue with visitors, the materials, merchandise, and makeup all cost money. In addition, there are the installation costs of turning a white cube gallery into a femme-oriented start up space complete with original sculptures, workstations, and weekly programming in the form of panels and workshops.

Covering gallery costs
Finally, like most galleries, VWC depends on sales from the show to sustain its operating costs. This exhibit however, unlike more traditional art exhibitions, will not have fine art objects for sale—thus denying the space of the ability to make money in the traditional, and problematic, manner. As an alternative form of sustainability, I am asking for the community’s support to share the burden of the gallery's costs for the duration of the LADYSCUMBAG exhibit. If you believe that the art world’s business model needs to be updated to reflect less elitist and more grassroots interests, this is your chance to help test drive a different model. By supporting this artist-run space that has taken many risks over the past 2+ years on the work and visions of emerging artists who are underrepresented in under the current market-driven art ecosystem, you are leveling the playing field and making space for more diverse points of view to come forth.
Breakdown of how funds will be used 

$5000 for contributor honorariums
$2000 for website + gallery costs
(web hosting + admin, gallery rent, utilities, demo of old wall, building new wall in different part of gallery, vinyl lettering, paint, drywall, 2x4s and other materials for installation, and labor and paint to restore space upon deinstallation)




$2000 merchandise materials
(200 utility bags, 100 yards custom LSB elastic, silkscreens, silkscreen ink, fabric, 3 embroidery pens, 100 yards assorted fabric, sewing machine needles and thread) 

$1000 events + programming

<p style=""text-align: center;"">My name is Ty, and about 6 months ago, I discovered a slight talent for drawing which I never knew I had! It all started when my wife bought me a box of Derwent Pastel Pencils and some drawing paper as a wedding gift (as I have always been a creative person, but never tried fine art before). The first ever drawing I did was the cheetah eyes you can see above. I was blown away by the outcome and fell in love with it. Since that first drawing, I have done three others and all have been donated as gifts and to various wildlife conservation fundraisers that the zoo I work for has thrown; including the Goodfellows Tree Kangaroo that you can also see above. This was actually the first of my works to be sold in a silent auction that raised money for various Tree Kangaroo conservation programs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Unfortunately, art supplies are not cheap, and in my amateur state, I did not have the foresight to sell a drawing to make money to pay for these new supplies.

<h3>What I Need</h3>
<ul><li><p><strong>Pan Pastels</strong> - the basic set of 7 colours I am looking at from softpastels.com.au is $89.95AUD (with $10 delivery fee) and will allow me to complete larger blocks of colour without wasting so much of my pencils.</p></li></ul>
<p><i>Getting these Pan Pastels is the main goal for my campaign, so I really only need $100, however, Indiegogo's 'minimum goal' has to be $500. So if there are many generous people out there and the funds go above $100, these are the items I would purchase with that money:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pastel Pencils</strong> - my current set are getting very short, so getting a new set would allow me to keep drawing and increase the chance of my drawings being able to fund future art supplies. The cheapest set of 60 Stabilo CarbOthello Pastel Pencils I have found is from theartshop.com.au and is $279.95AUD.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pastelmat Paper</strong> - this paper is known in the industry as one of the best for pastel pencils and I have never had enough money to buy some! Pads range anywhere from $39.95-$89.95AUD depending on the size of the paper</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extra Pan Pastels</strong> - the set I have outlined above is great to start off with and will allow me to mix to create a large number of colours, but there are many other sets with many specific shades that would be amazing to be able to use and experiment with.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><i>If I am not able to reach my personal goal of $100, the money will be going into a specific art account to which I will add whenever I have a few dollars spare, and hopfully will eventually reach the $100 goal on my own in the future.</i></p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Drawing is fun for me. Wildlife conservation is important to me. So I will always be drawing with the intention to raise money and awarness for various conservation efforts around the world. Your contributions are going to allow me to keep doing this.</p>
<p>100% of the money from the few artworks I do personally sell will go back into funding future art supplies (I wish I thought about this from the beginning haha), and if I make more money than is needed for the supplies, the rest will be donated to particular wildlife charities. I see my art as a way to help and contribute, rather than a way for me to make money for myself.</p>
<p>So thank you in advance. While the contribution you may make today is going to the purchase of art supplies, those art supplies are contributing to good things for endangered species around the world.</p>
</div></div>","My name is Ty, and about 6 months ago, I discovered a slight talent for drawing which I never knew I had! It all started when my wife bought me a box of Derwent Pastel Pencils and some drawing paper as a wedding gift (as I have always been a creative person, but never tried fine art before). The first ever drawing I did was the cheetah eyes you can see above. I was blown away by the outcome and fell in love with it. Since that first drawing, I have done three others and all have been donated as gifts and to various wildlife conservation fundraisers that the zoo I work for has thrown; including the Goodfellows Tree Kangaroo that you can also see above. This was actually the first of my works to be sold in a silent auction that raised money for various Tree Kangaroo conservation programs.
Unfortunately, art supplies are not cheap, and in my amateur state, I did not have the foresight to sell a drawing to make money to pay for these new supplies. I have essentially almost used up all of my pencils doing drawings that I have donated to raise money for wildlife charities. So this campaign is to raise a little money so I can buy some supplies that will be able to pay for themselves thereafter.  
The very first art piece that will be made, however, will be a drawing that I am donating to a Sun Bear fundraiser my work is throwing in November. While the planning is still in the early stages and exact charities have not be finalised, the money raised will go to various Sun Bear conservation programs such as Free the Bears.

<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>I have always been fascinated with mythology and folk tales.  When I was a little girl living in Germany, I would go to the library for the high school and read Grimm's Fairy Tales and books on the Greek Myths.  Part of the fun of teaching History for a living is that I've gotten the opportunity to explore and learn more of the myths from many different cultures.  A few years ago, I was brainstorming ideas for a new project and I saw a piece of art of the Virginia State Flag with the goddess Virtue. I had the idea of doing a series of portraits of people as various gods and goddesses.  I started out shooting a self portrait of myself as the Eumenides, or Furies.  And for the past few years, I've been shooting portraits of my friends and other people who have volunteered for the project as well as an additional self portrait as the goddess Nemesis. The word Pantheon means all gods.  I didn't want to limit myself to any particular mythos, but to be open to shooting people as a god or goddess relation to their ethnic heritage or to whom they felt a particular connection. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I'm Hoping For</h3>
<p>I have been working on this project for a couple of years now and I want to finish my collection of portraits and mount a show of the images.  In addition to the show, I would like to self-publish a book of all of the portraits taken, as there were many taken in addition to the final ones that will be collected. </p>
<p>I'm hoping to raise at least $2000 to pay for high quality prints and display of the images in a fairly large format.  I feel these portraits would best portray their subjects in a larger size.  This would also help to pay for buying prints of the book. </p>
<p>I would also use some of the money to help fund costumes and travel expenses for the portraits themselves. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>As a full-time teacher, I don't have a lot of spare time to dedicate to my art and I do not have a lot of income coming in from my art.  I have so many ideas and photos that get shared on my social media that never get an opportunity to be seen by a greater audience. This would give me the opportunity to submit this show to some venues outside of the area to try to gain greater exposure for my art. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I started this project a couple of years ago.  The original idea was to work with a partner and to share the cost of the project.  But I am now pursuing this project solo and could use assistance.  I also want to work on adding portraits from more diverse backgrounds to the collection. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How can you help? </h3>
<p>If you're unable to contribute financially, please help by sharing the link for this project and help promote it. </p>
<p>If you have any ideas for myths beyond the European Pantheons, please let me know.  I'm hoping to expand the reach of the project to multiple cultures. </p>

I’ll be keeping a daily logbook that I will process into a digital book once returned. I will also be working on a new body of work during the expedition and anticipate having enough material to inspire me to more creations once back on land. If you are curious, check my links to more of my artwork (see bottom of page).  My personal missionHaving a love for art, photography and for living in awareness, I’m eager to make a difference on this beautiful planet we live on. I’m curious to collaborate and excited about the inter-disciplinary exchange we are being offered through this residency, it’s a unique opportunity to share ideas with the scientists and artists on the ship.Furthermore I am passionate about the whole idea of going on an expedition, a true adventure! Currently I’m greatly under the spell of the first explorers to the Polar regions. I live just ten minutes away from the RRS Discovery, the glorious tall ship that sailed both the Arctic and Antarctic with heroes such as Captain Scott and Shackleton on board. There’s a rich archive of vintage photographs, films, logbooks, diaries, books and original polar. I’m engrossed in research and connecting with some of our very own modern day explorers. How does the crowdfunding work?If you feel you would like to help and support my participation on this Arctic experience, I would be grateful for any small or larger donation, any gift is gracefully accepted. As a token of appreciation I would love to offer you a memento of my expedition, in the form of a digital photograph, a Giclée art print (postcard, A5 or A4), a digital copy of my daily logbook, original one of a kind burned photographic artwork (to be handpicked after the expedition). And a few bespoke items like;  a ‘souvenir’ artwork from the Arctic,  a glass plate- or fine art photo session (at an exceptional price).  See Perks! If you choose not to donate but would like to support, please share this crowdfunding page in your circles, I’m grateful for any additional exposure. Original Darkroom door on the RRS Discovery   What do I need funding for?£ 4.500,-  expedition costs£ 1.340,-  travel and accommodation expenses £ 2.450,-  extreme weather clothing, photography gear, and art supplies £    500,-  additional research costs, use of archival material. Minimum needed £8.790,-   £ 1.375,-   additional personal costs, including household and an extra tour in SvalbardTarget full expedition costs (minus already received funding)  £9.415,-  Stretch-goalsWith extra funding I will be able to set new goals as follows:I would love to support the RRS Discovery Tall Ship in Dundee. An addition to the ship would be to help build an original darkroom on board, as it was during the first Scott voyage to the Antarctic in 1901. This expedition carried out scientific research and geographical exploration. It launched the careers of many of the leading figures in the heroic age of Polar exploration.  Already part funded!As part of the residency The Arctic Circle partners have already invested half of the costs of the voyage to help me.  I have also received sponsorship from Creative Scotland, Fife council, Fife Cultural Trust, Fife Contemporary, thanks to the Visual Artist And Craftmaker Award 2018. This has been deducted from the total needed.   Why fund this project?What is exciting about The Arctic Circle Expedition is the unique collaboration between artists and scientists. This annual expedition has been garnering international attention since 2008 and widespread support from arts and science institutions worldwide.The expedition provides a rich environment serving the creative exploration of our world and raising awareness. It also offers a platform that encourages the participants to contribute through presentations, publications and art exhibits. With an extensive network I’m looking forward to these public engagement opportunities and new exhibitions that will reach a new audience worldwide. Risks and challengesOkay, so I’ll be flying up to the tippy-top of the world, the last bit of land in sight.  Then sailing on a Barquentine tall ship through frozen lands and icy waters. There will be possibility of bad weather and minus 20-degree temperatures. We’ll enjoy daytrips to and from the ship on smaller vessels and may have encounters with polar bears and other wildlife. All in all, the voyage is not without danger.Of course we will be well prepared with adequate cold weather clothing, warm cabins and will be in the good hands of a capable captain and crew taking care of our safe passage at all times.   Other ways you can support and stay in the loopPlease do share this campaign if you can with the Indigogo link. Follow my journey as I prepare for my upcoming trip to the Arctic via my Facebook link at the top of the page! Thank you for reading and for your support!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong><u>Speed Dating Round 1…! (An Introduction to the Project)</u></strong></p>
<p>The Sable Dragonfly is a multimedia production that emphasizes the black female body and her experiences lived through her skin. Expressed through Sakile Odimo’s artistic voice from her own personal experiences as a black woman, this project will highlight the mystery, majesty, beauty, vulnerability, and tribulations it takes to maneuver this society as a black female. In a time where society is beginning to see the repercussions of turning a blind eye to those who are marginalized and underrepresented, this project’s purpose is to not only give the black woman a voice, but to create awareness for others to see why it is so important to break down stereotypes, oppression, and sexism surrounding a people and to create a culture that truly protects and values black women.</p>
<p>Our writer and director, Sakile Odimo has been writing poetry since the age of 6 and is twice published. In 2017 she wrote, produced, and directed #MelaninRich, during her summer CCCP program at UCLA. Her and the poem were both featured in the art gallery and show “We Real Cool” at Los Angeles’ art gallery Junior High.  “The Sable Dragonfly: An Ode To My Black Female Body” is a larger more advantages project similar to #MelaninRich as it is a visual chapbook that focuses on the black female body &amp; how it's regarded within space. Told in four parts, “From My Eyes” “From Their Eyes” “From My Mouth” “From Their Mouth” the film and art installation will be a visual representation, told through one black woman’s experiences to give a tangible feeling as to what it means to be a black woman. The goal of both the film and the art instillation is to provide a safe space for the black female body and soul to move and interact with space and herself freely in an authentic way.</p>
<p><u><strong>There’s No Such Thing As a Free Lunch! (Production Costs and Perks, Why We Need Your Money!)</strong></u></p>
<p>We need to raise 3500 dollars to cover production costs, film equipment, printing and manufacturing costs for both the chapbooks (the collection of all the poems and testimonials in The Sable Dragonfly), and for the photo stills that will hang in the art gallery on the night of the premiere and art instillation. These funds will also go towards paying the cast and crew. Every penny helps in making this project a reality and everyone apart of the project appreciates anything you can donate!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Perks for every donation include-</strong></p>
<p><strong>5 Donation:</strong> An emailed thank you from the cast and crew!</p>
<p><strong>20 Donation:</strong> A personal thank you shout-out at the end of that week’s bts video.  </p>

Full head life-cast:
Life casting is a process widely used in the special effects makeup world of the Film & TV industry to create realistic effects of other peoples body's and also a technique used in Under the Skin to create the sculptures. 
Skin-safe silicone is applied to the entire head leaving the nostrils open for breathing; it is then cured and removed, this process generally take less than 45 minutes.  Once removed the negative mold ( the imprinted copy of your face in silicone) will be filled with stone. Once the stone has cured we will de-mold the stone and your copy will be complete!! This is generally not recommended for people who are claustrophobic. 
Limited quantity of 4!
Please be sure to fill out shipping information so you can be contacted about setting up a date and time for your life-cast.


daniel-mcquade.com/perks   This project is funded in part by the Orange County Arts Council’s Community Arts Grants!  Stages: 
Life-Casting:a process that involves taking a mold of a body part with a skin safe silicone.

Clay pour:a process that involves pouring molten clay into the life-cast to create a rough copy of the sculpture

Refining the sculpture:adding/fixing details in clay with sculpture tools.

Fiberglass Molding:a process that involves take the final sculpture and creating a mold with fiberglass to later cast in silicone.

Silicone Casting: a process that involves taking the fiberglass mold and casting in it with skin colored silicone.

<h3>Animal Spirits of the Apocalypse Oracle Deck</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Leiana, also known as Loveday. I am a Louisiana based artist and I make weird art for weird people. </p>
<p>I am also a fortune teller. I've been reading the cards for over thirty years. I come from a long line of women that dabbled in the spiritual.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this pandemic, all the markets and festivals that I would ordinarily sell my art work at have been cancelled, leaving me unemployed and with nothing definitive to do.</p>
<p>So what does an artist do in the quiet at the end of the world? She combines all her skills and creates an Oracle Deck.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587565492/pvdpjnlj4uuqhsfph1ky.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>What does it all mean</strong></p>
<p>One of the most exciting aspects of creating an Oracle deck is that it's a complete blank slate. I am starting fresh but also tapping into the long tradition of spirit animals and shamanism that have their roots in most ancient tribal societies, including the Celtic history that I find myself most drawn to.</p>
<p>I approached the Animal Spirits of the Apocalypse from a playful point of view.</p>
<p>38 cards. 19 x 2 is 38 (Covid 19).</p>
<p>I've been in quarantine for over 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>Four Suits</strong>: The Spiky, the Dead, the Visionary, and the Tentacled</p>
<p>Nine cards in each suit PLUS two joker cards: <strong>The Sanitizer</strong> and <strong>The TP.</strong></p>
<p>As I said, playful point of view, but even in play we can tap into a deeper truth.</p>

<p><strong>The Cards designs are all finished</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>The deck is ready to go to the printer as soon as I have the funds together to order them. Production time should be no more than two to three months (with a little leeway for the ongoing pandemic)</p>
<p>Anything you can give would be appreciated. Perks start at $5 with a downloadable PDF that tells you all about the Animal Spirits of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>Even if you could just spread the word. Please tell all your friends: the ones that like weird things, who like weird art, the ones who like crystals, the ones who like Tarot decks, the ones who like anything pagan or New Age.</p>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<p>What better way to experience the ten principals of Burning Man than to climb upon a glorious 12-foot tall trophy and celebrate your incredible accomplishments, whatever the they may be.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moop-picker uppers… climb up on top.</p>
<p>You helped a neighbor camp build their monkey hut?… step up that ladder!</p>
<p>You walked all the way out to the trash fence and back?!?! Holy shit, make your way up there!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By raising $17,000, we’ll reconstruct a trophy fifteen times larger than the one that likely stood on a mantel, way back in your childhood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If each of us 70,000 Burning Man attendees simply donate 25¢ a piece, we’ll fund this grand project and get started. Seeing as that’ll probably be a challenge, we’re asking all friends and passionate Playa dwellers to donate as much as they’d like. We even have a series of gifts, typical for these types of crowdfunding projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please check out the video, click to donate and also spread it to your friends. Much love to you all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why We Want To Build This:</strong></p>
<p>We’ve been going to Burning Man for years and love abiding by the ten principles. We also enjoy the art projects that are incomplete without someone interacting with them. For example, like the Playa Barbie box and the DaVinci wings you climb upon. This will be the first large scale project we’ve brought but we’ve been a part of several Playa projects and also have experience building large scale projects in the default world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If This Is Successful:</strong></p>
<p>If this is successful, we’ll continue to add to the collection of trophies year after year and eventually have our own massive trophy shelf on the Playa. Seeing as this year’s theme is Metamorphosis, this trophy’s theme is ‘MOST IMPROVED’. And the following trophies for each year will also tie into that year’s theme.</p>

We’ve been going to Burning Man for years and love abiding by the ten principles. We also enjoy the art projects that are incomplete without someone interacting with them. For example, like the Playa Barbie box and the DaVinci wings you climb upon. This will be the first large scale project we’ve brought but we’ve been a part of several Playa projects and also have experience building large scale projects in the default world.
 
 
If This Is Successful:
If this is successful, we’ll continue to add to the collection of trophies year after year and eventually have our own massive trophy shelf on the Playa. Seeing as this year’s theme is Metamorphosis, this trophy’s theme is ‘MOST IMPROVED’. And the following trophies for each year will also tie into that year’s theme.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I created The Tarot of the Grand Pas because I wanted to find a deck that completely resonated with my soul and what I'm passionate about. Ballet has been a part of my life since I was 2 years old and it means the world to me, so I decided to combine a few of my passions together in order to create something that feels personal to me but that could also exist for the benefit of others.</p>

<h3>How You Can Help </h3>
<p>Contributions go toward creating the full deck, hand made bags, other printed products, and a booklet. Potentially, a box could be an addition to the deck. I have a flexible goal because any amount helps!</p>
