The cost varies from country-to-country. You can see the price during the checkout process. </p><p><strong> Will I be charged Tax in the EU? </strong></p><p>Customers in certain countries in the EU (France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Italy and Spain) will NOT have to pay tax on arrival. We will pre-pay all customs taxes, duties and admin fees meaning no sudden surprises during delivery! Customers in other EU countries may have to pay tax but we will do our best to minimise these. Please note that other than the countries listed above, we are not able to pay these taxes on your behalf. </p><p><strong>Will I be charged Tax elsewhere?</strong></p><p>Taxes vary from country to country and due to the global nature of Indiegogo, it's impossible for us to make arrangements for every single country. However, we have done our best to minimise any taxes and import fees for you by either shipping from local hubs or pre-paying the taxes on individual shipments. Backers in France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Italy and Spain do not have to worry about additional taxes and fees, as we have paid these in advance.</p><p>Backers in the following countries should also not have to pay any additional fees: the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan. Based on our experience, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines should generally be fine but larger pledges (e.g. the multi-pack) may incur additional import fees. Backers in other EU countries may have to pay VAT or other import duties. Backers in Mexico, Brazil, India and Russia should be aware that the import process can be quite tricky and you may need to provide us with your tax information prior to shipping. </p><p><strong>How long will shipping take? </strong></p><p>Shipping will take between 3-7 days for most countries. We'll update all backers several days before our shipping commences and will notify you as soon as your product is on its way. Will my products be trackable? Yes! All orders will be fully trackable. We'll send tracking numbers out to you via email 2-3 days after your order has been shipped.</p><p><strong>Can I get a refund if I don't like my product? </strong></p><p>Unlike most Indiegogo campaigns, our backers are able to claim a refund if they change their minds.

The cost varies from country-to-country. You can see the price during the checkout process.  Will I be charged Tax in the EU? Customers in certain countries in the EU (France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Italy and Spain) will NOT have to pay tax on arrival. We will pre-pay all customs taxes, duties and admin fees meaning no sudden surprises during delivery! Customers in other EU countries may have to pay tax but we will do our best to minimise these. Please note that other than the countries listed above, we are not able to pay these taxes on your behalf. Will I be charged Tax elsewhere?Taxes vary from country to country and due to the global nature of Indiegogo, it's impossible for us to make arrangements for every single country. However, we have done our best to minimise any taxes and import fees for you by either shipping from local hubs or pre-paying the taxes on individual shipments. Backers in France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Italy and Spain do not have to worry about additional taxes and fees, as we have paid these in advance.Backers in the following countries should also not have to pay any additional fees: the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan. Based on our experience, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines should generally be fine but larger pledges (e.g. the multi-pack) may incur additional import fees. Backers in other EU countries may have to pay VAT or other import duties. Backers in Mexico, Brazil, India and Russia should be aware that the import process can be quite tricky and you may need to provide us with your tax information prior to shipping. How long will shipping take? Shipping will take between 3-7 days for most countries. We'll update all backers several days before our shipping commences and will notify you as soon as your product is on its way. Will my products be trackable? Yes! All orders will be fully trackable. We'll send tracking numbers out to you via email 2-3 days after your order has been shipped.Can I get a refund if I don't like my product? Unlike most Indiegogo campaigns, our backers are able to claim a refund if they change their minds. Please be aware that the Kickstarter fees are not refundable and the return shipping fee will be borne by the backer.  Is there a warranty on the bags? Yes! All products come with a one year warranty. The warranties cover all manufacturing defects.

<p>Tenkara is a Japanese style of fly fishing that dates back hundreds of years and pre dates the Western or traditional form of fly fishing (with a reel and loading line) that we know now.  It involves a long rod usually 8-13 feet in length, a very lightweight fixed line, tippet, and flies.  There is no reel in Tenkara.  This makes it much easier to learn because it helps you focus on the fly and not the line.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522338768/tuygwiepmg2abn5rkjet.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The Teton Zoom is our first adjustable length Tenkara rod.  You can fish this rod at both 10.5 ft. and 12 ft lengths.  Adjustable length rods have been around for some time.  And a couple years ago after many people kept inquiring about them we decided to make one of our own.  After two years of prototypes and testing we feel really pleased with this rod.</p>

<p>A zoom rod allows you to fish two different lengths of rod.  This means that you can easily transition from small water to bigger water.  It also helps reduce the need for other rods.  Instead of having a 10.5 ft. rod and a 12 ft. now you can just fish with the Teton Zoom and cover your ass.  For the longest time we tested and debated zoom rods.  Every sample we would try just didn't feel right.  Either the longest length would feel too noodly and disconnected, or the shortest length would feel too stiff.  We feel that this rod maintains a semi soft feel at both lengths.  </p>

<p>We were born on Kickstarter 5 years ago with the Teton and Sawtooth rod models and have continued to love and support this platform.  Since the beginning, we have been pushing the limits of Tenkara while innovating as much as possible.  In 2015 we released our Mini Rods which received overwhelming support from the Kickstarter community and blogosphere raising $220K, which is the most funded fishing crowdfunding project to date.</p>
<p>Since we started, we have released multiple new rods, nets, apparel, and accessories as well as done some fun collaborations with brands that we admire.  We are a passionate group of fishing enthusiasts who also have many other hobbies like biking, surfing, hunting, skiing, and snowboarding. </p>

</div></div>","Tenkara is a Japanese style of fly fishing that dates back hundreds of years and pre dates the Western or traditional form of fly fishing (with a reel and loading line) that we know now.  It involves a long rod usually 8-13 feet in length, a very lightweight fixed line, tippet, and flies.  There is no reel in Tenkara.  This makes it much easier to learn because it helps you focus on the fly and not the line.

The Teton Zoom is our first adjustable length Tenkara rod.  You can fish this rod at both 10.5 ft. and 12 ft lengths.  Adjustable length rods have been around for some time.  And a couple years ago after many people kept inquiring about them we decided to make one of our own.  After two years of prototypes and testing we feel really pleased with this rod.


A zoom rod allows you to fish two different lengths of rod.  This means that you can easily transition from small water to bigger water.  It also helps reduce the need for other rods.  Instead of having a 10.5 ft. rod and a 12 ft. now you can just fish with the Teton Zoom and cover your ass.  For the longest time we tested and debated zoom rods.  Every sample we would try just didn't feel right.  Either the longest length would feel too noodly and disconnected, or the shortest length would feel too stiff.  We feel that this rod maintains a semi soft feel at both lengths.

Our Story:  Just as every story has a hero, the YAB story begins with Mahmoud Parto—a recent college graduate at Iowa State University (a school known for Applied Technology and Science around the World); an engineer who’s mind is always constantly running and tinkering; And dubbed among his peers as “The Problem Finder meets Entrepreneurial Engineer Extraordinaire.”  The David vs Goliath moment Mahmoud faced? The University’s gigantic parking lot (quite literally, the Goliath).   “One day I parked my car in the university’s parking lot and took the bus to campus. When returning, it took me over an hour to find my car. One hour! Needless to say, I was not at all familiar with the area,” Mahmoud described about the spark that set him on the path of developing YAB. But how many times is this all too familiar? It turns out this happens a lot as Mahmoud discovered when doing customer discovery.  “After discovering the initial problem and creating the car finder, I then realized that YAB can have other features such as reminding the parking meter expiration time, providing driving feedback, and many more.” YAB is the smartest person in the room.

Since all the light bars on the market are single-piece affairs that stick out considerably farther than much of the body of the motorcycle, they can act as levers in the event of a crash and increase the damage to the delicate components and frame in the front of the bike. When the light bars share mounting bolts with the engine oil radiator, as they do on many bikes, a small crash while exploring the backcountry could leave a rider stranded.</p>
<p>Attempting to avoid this eventuality, I took to designing my own light bars that would mitigate, by redirecting, the forces of an impact away from the motorcycle frame and oil cooler. Initially, I made a flexible mount out of a thin steel plate that would bend upward in a crash. While this solution works all right as a basic mount cobbled together in an afternoon, it really does not really meet the requirements for a tough, well-designed solution. So I got to work to make something better than any other light bar out there.</p>
<p>Thus, like many of my ideas, The Owen Motoworks Folding Lightbar was born over my almost obsessive compulsion to improve and tinker on my BMW R1100GS motorcycle.  Seeking to reimagine this otherwise unnoticed component and create something that not only would provide a platform for auxiliary driving lights but also decrease the chance that a small crash could lead to catastrophe, I took cues from a car’s folding mirrors. I used TurboCAD to design a three-piece light bar that would fold from fully extended to tuck in under the fairing in the event of an impact. Eventually, Owen Motoworks Folding Lightbars will be able to fit as many motorcycle brands as possible without sacrificing their trademark functionality. My initial design thus incorporates mounting options for BMW’s R1100GS, R1150GS, and R1200GS motorcycles, arguably the largest market for this type of product. My first prototype constructed out of easily modified poplar served as a proof of concept, providing the confidence to move onto the next step.</p>
<p>To create a bar that will fold easily but remain fixed even over harsh terrain will require a couple prototypes to be machined. As I have put my time in the conceptual, design and initial prototype stages, this final prototype stage should be straightforward. However, between the tooling, raw material costs, and the machinist’s expertise, this phase is quickly draining my initial capital set aside for this project.

<p><strong>What goals has Travis reached?</strong></p>
<p>The funding goal of $80,000 was reached just three days after the campaign was launched, on March 25th. On the same day, we also reached $100k! Our first stretch goal was $250k, which was reached at the end of March. The movement kept getting bigger and now we have over 5,000 backers and over $1M raised to help Travis bridge language barriers. </p>
<p><strong>What features have we added to Travis?</strong></p>
<p>We promised that when we reach $400k, we would introduce three new offline languages. We took on your suggestions and will introduce the languages you requested; Cantonese, Vietnamese and Brazilian Portuguese. Another addition is an optional protective pouch to prevent dust and scratches. </p>

<li><p><i>How are you able to translate in so many languages?</i><br/>Travis make use of translation engines from several companies with advanced translation technology. Because of that we are able to offer far more languages than any single engine, even more than 80. We chose 80 languages out of caution and plan to expand with (free) future updates.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Is your translation better than others and how?</i><br/>It's as good as the best, because Travis chooses the best translation engines for each language. Since we integrated the best options in one product, you don't have to fuss about which translation software to use.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Does the translation improve over time?</i><br/>Yes, translation engines use artificial intelligence and machine learning to learn translation patterns which improve over time. We are also building our own neural network to better detect slang and accents. That's why we are starting this movement for early adopters, so you can support us in moving towards a world without language barriers!</p></li>
<li><p><i>Do you ship to my country?</i><br/>Yes, we ship worldwide.</p></li>
<li><p><i>What are the delivery costs?</i><br/>After pledging and and selecting your country of delivery, your shipping costs will be shown. We cannot take responsibility for specific country customs costs and if incurred, these will be at the customers expense. </p></li>
<li><p><i>Can I pre-order but indicate a delivery date other than in October?</i><br/>Yes, please state that in comments section of your pre-order.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Can I pre-order if I’m not sure of my delivery address yet?</i><br/>Sure, we will always ask you for your address before delivery.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Will there be software updates? Are they free?</i><br/>Yes, Travis will be frequently updated by over the air updates and all updates are free for Indiegogo backers.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Does Travis come with earphones (wireless/wired) so I can listen privately during meetings or conferences?</i><br/>Earphones are not included with the product, but Travis supports most wired and wireless earphones, incl. Apple Airpods,  so you’re free to use whichever brand and type is your favourite.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Does Travis come with a SIM card?</i><br/>A SIM card is not provided included with your device. Travis can however take a Nano SIM, use wifi or hotspot from a phone. </p></li>

<p><strong>¿Qué metas ha alcanzado Travis?</strong></p>
<p>La meta de financiación de 80,000$ fue alcanzada apenas tres días después de lanzar la campaña, el 25 de marzo. ¡El mismo día también logramos 100k$! Nuestro primer stretch goal fue de 250.000$, que se consiguió a finales de marzo. El movimiento se fue haciendo cada vez más grande por lo que anunciamos un nuevo stretch goal de 400.000 dólares, que luego se convirtió en medio millón gracias a más de 3.000 patrocinadores increíbles.</p>
<p><strong>¿Qué características hemos añadido a Travis?</strong></p>
<p>Prometimos que cuando alcanzáramos los $ 400k, introduciríamos tres nuevos idiomas en modo fuera de línea. Seguimos vuestras sugerencias e introducimos los idiomas que solicitaron: Cantonés, Vietnamita y Portugués brasileño. Otra adición fue la bolsa de protección para evitar el polvo y arañazos.</p>

<p><strong>¿</strong><i>Cómo es posible traducir en tantos idiomas?</i></p>
<p>Travis utiliza motores de traducción de varias empresas con avanzada tecnología de traducción. Debido a eso somos capaces de ofrecer muchos más idiomas que cualquier otro motor, incluso más de 80.

Imagine a refugee arriving in a foreign country and wanting to start their life again without speaking the language at all. We want to give everyone the right to be understood! Travis is a handy device we believe will inspire change, encourage travel and create connections that weren’t previously possible. We can empower the 7 billion people in this planet who speak over 6,500 languages to come together and have a casual chat, order a drink, do business or maybe even fall in love.In a globalising world, language differences can lead to social exclusion, dangerous misunderstandings and missed friendships & business opportunities. So call us crazy or naive, but here at Travis, we think we can bring the world together, by making sure we can all have a chat.Travis is a portable device that uses artificial intelligence to translate speech to speech in 80 languages, all in less than two seconds. Travis has some unique features that include:By becoming an early adopter and providing feedback, we'll be to provide over the air updates to make Travis even better.We’ve partnered with Movement on the Ground, an organisation operating on the frontline of the biggest refugee crisis in history. Volunteers in Lesbos, Greece, are faced with language barriers every day and Travis has recognised an opportunity to bridge these barriers and support their positive work. We have previously supported them in a local Dutch campaign, contributing 20 devices. While these will be very helpful for the non-profit organisation, we’re ready to have even more impact to help bridge language barriers!How can you help MotG?In supporting this campaign $10 from every order will be donated towards MotG until the end of December. These funds will go towards devices for volunteers and refugees in Greece. Earlier in our campaign, we partnered with Open Learning Exchange (OLE) to help refugees starting new lives and learning new languages in foreign places. Over 200 devices have been donated to grassroots programs that assist refugees in education.Apps are great, but things like battery life, speed and most of all, eye contact can become a struggle. Travis is a purpose-built device for face-to-face communication. We've integrated the best apps for each language into the device so it seamlessly navigates and selects the best translation for your chosen languages.  With just one Travis you can:Use built-in microphone & built-in speakersThis is the most common use for Travis, hearing via its dual noise cancelling microphones, and clearly repeating what is said in another language via its speakers.Use built-in microphones + earphones (wired/wireless)Travis hears what is said via its built-in dual noise cancelling microphones, and repeats what is said in your ear via the wired/wireless earphones.For travel - Whether in Shanghai or Paris, Travis helps you to speak to locals, get a cab, order food and drinks or simply ask, ""How are you? Where are you from? What are your ambitions?"" As expats & international students - Moving to a new country can be stressful -  getting the kids into school, arranging health care and figuring out food options at the grocery store or market. Travis can't solve all your challenges, but we can make it easier for you to connect with the locals and feel at home. For cross-cultural families - Have a girlfriend, wife or husband whose family speaks a whole other language? Many of our backers do, and will be using Travis to communicate with the in-laws. Contact with refugees - Some of our backers are getting a Travis to communicate with refugees. Not only for social work, but  to speak to new neighbours, colleagues and classmates as well. We partner with organisations who help with refugees and aid work and Travis helps bridging language barriers with volunteers and the people they help. How will you use Travis? Join the movement with a pledge for Travis or donate to Travis x OLE, and let us know on the comments page. Thanks!During 2016, Nick, Lennart and Brend decided they wanted to work together by launching meaningful products. With over 20 nationalities in their direct environment in the Rotterdam innovation ecosystem, they experienced a many language barriers to really make impact with innovation. This was the starting point of their new adventure. Bridging Language Barriers!Nowadays Travis is a three continent team working from New York, Rotterdam (The Netherlands) and Shenzhen (China) with decades of management and product development experience, and a history of selling over 10 million devices.Lennart van der Ziel, CEO - From law school to start-up scene, led multiple international teams in IT consulting, successfully launched various software products, a community builder, loves making road trips.Nick NM Yap, CPO - Product geek with over 20 years of experience in creating products in three continents, countless trips made, believes travel is all about human connection.Brend Kouwenhoven, COO - Combining innovation, entrepreneurship, and finance to improve the world, over 20 years of experience with corporates, governments and ventures and now using it to remove language barriers with Travis.


 

Customer-ready deviceProduction and shipping have started. Software has continuous updates for increased speed, additional languages and more offline benefits. These improvements come free of charge by Over the air Updates. 


 

What goals has Travis reached?
The funding goal of $80,000 was reached just three days after the campaign was launched, on March 25th. On the same day, we also reached $100k! Our first stretch goal was $250k, which was reached at the end of March. The movement kept getting bigger and now we have over 5,000 backers and over $1M raised to help Travis bridge language barriers. 
What features have we added to Travis?
We promised that when we reach $400k, we would introduce three new offline languages. We took on your suggestions and will introduce the languages you requested; Cantonese, Vietnamese and Brazilian Portuguese. Another addition is an optional protective pouch to prevent dust and scratches. 


The Go Business Edition includes the ability to have Travis make a  transcript of your conversations in their original and translated language. You can sync your conversations from Travis in a matter of minutes! In future this will only be available under a premium subscription service ($99 per year). For InDemand we are offering 1 year free as a reward for your support.
Here's how it works:

 
20 Offline : Spanish, German, Chinese (Mandarin), French, Portuguese, Arabic, Italian, Japanese, English, Russian, Dutch, Polish, Greek, Swedish, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, Thai, Turkish, Indonesian*Please be aware that not all 20 languages are currently available however we are working to include them as soon as possible.80 Online : Afrikaans, Albanian, Arabic, Armenian, Basque, Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Mandarin), Chinese (Taiwanese), Chinese (Cantonese), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (UK), English (USA), English (Australia), Esperanto, Estonian, Farsi, Filipino, Finnish, French, French (Canada), Frisian, German, Greek, Haitian Creole, Hawaiian, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Javanese, Kazakh, Khmer, Korean, Kurdish, Lao, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxembourgish, Macedonian, Malay, Maltese, Mongolian, Myanmar, Nepali, Norwegian, Pashto, Persian, Polish, Portuguese (Portugal), Portuguese (Brazil), Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Scots Gaelic, Serbian, Sindhi, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish (Spain), Spanish (USA), Spanish (Mexico), Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, WelshWe are constantly listening to how we can enable you to boldly go global and speak local and spread the movement in the coming months. Let us know in the comments page about languages that you want to see in the 80 online or 20 offline languages.
How are you able to translate in so many languages?Travis make use of translation engines from several companies with advanced translation technology. Because of that we are able to offer far more languages than any single engine, even more than 80. We chose 80 languages out of caution and plan to expand with (free) future updates.
Is your translation better than others and how?It's as good as the best, because Travis chooses the best translation engines for each language. Since we integrated the best options in one product, you don't have to fuss about which translation software to use.
Does the translation improve over time?Yes, translation engines use artificial intelligence and machine learning to learn translation patterns which improve over time. We are also building our own neural network to better detect slang and accents.

Any other questions? Feel free to ask and we’ll get back to you!Travis en español!Imagina llegar a un aeropuerto y tratar de explicar a un taxista a dónde ir en un idioma que no hablas, o incluso tratar de comunicarte con un médico después de un accidente en un idioma que ni siquiera sabes. Imagínate un refugiado que llega a un país extranjero y que quiere comenzar de nuevo su vida sin hablar el idioma en absoluto. ¡Queremos dar a todos el derecho a ser entendidos!

 
Travis es un dispositivo práctico que creemos que inspirará el cambio, estimulará los viajes y creará conexiones que antes no eran posibles. Podemos hacer que los 7 mil millones de personas en este planeta que hablan más de 6.500 idiomas puedan reunirse y tener una charla informal, pedir una bebida, hacer negocios o, tal vez, incluso enamorarse.En un mundo globalizado, las diferencias lingüísticas pueden conducir a la exclusión social, malentendidos peligrosos y amistades y oportunidades de negocio perdidas. Así que llámanos locos o ingenuos, pero aquí en Travis, pensamos que podemos unir al mundo, asegurándonos de que todos podamos hablar.Travis es un dispositivo portátil que utiliza la inteligencia artificial para traducir conversaciones en 80 idiomas, todo en menos de dos segundos. Travis tiene algunas características que lo hacen único como:Al convertirte en uno los primeros en pedirlo y en proporcionar “feedback”, estaremos ofreciendo actualizaciones vía Internet para que Travis sea aún mejor.Únete al Movimiento y Haz la DiferenciaNos hemos asociado con “Movement on the Ground”, una organización que opera en primera línea de la crisis de refugiados más grande de la historia. Los voluntarios en Lesbos, Grecia, se enfrentan cada día a un problema lingüístico y Travis ha querido aprovechar esta oportunidad para superar las barreras idiomáticas y apoyar su trabajo. Anteriormente, apoyamos en una campaña holandesa local, contribuyendo con 20 dispositivos. Si bien estos serán muy útiles para la organización sin fines de lucro, ¡estamos listos para tener aún más impacto y ayudar a superar las barreras del idioma!¿Cómo puedo ayudar a MotG?Al apoyar esta campaña, 10$ de cada dispositivos serán donados a MotG hasta finales de diciembre. Estos fondos se destinarán a dispositivos para ayudar a los voluntarios y refugiados en Grecia.Anteriormente en nuestra campaña, nos asociamos con Open Learning Exchange (OLE) para ayudar a los refugiados a iniciar una nueva vida y aprender nuevos idiomas en lugares extranjeros. Más de 200 dispositivos fueron donados a programas de base que ayudan a los refugiados en la educación.Las aplicaciones son geniales y algunas hacen un trabajo muy bueno, pero cuando estás usando una aplicación en tu móvil tienes que pelearte con cosas como la duración de la batería, la velocidad y, sobretodo, el contacto visual. Travis es un aparato específicamente diseñado para establecer una comunicación cara a cara. Travis sabe cuales son las mejores aplicaciones para cada lenguaje y así no tienes que perder tiempo en eso.Durante 2016, Nick, Lennart y Brend decidieron que querían trabajar juntos lanzando productos innovadores y significativos. Con más de 20 nacionalidades diferentes en el entorno de innovación de Rotterdam, experimentaron muchas barreras lingüísticas para realmente hacer impacto mediante la innovación. Este fue el punto de partida de su nueva aventura. ¡Poder superar las barreras idiomáticas!Travis actualmente está formado por un equipo de tres continentes que trabaja desde Nueva York, Rotterdam (Países Bajos) y Shenzhen (China), con décadas de experiencia en gestión y desarrollo de productos y una historia de venta de más de 10 millones de dispositivos.Lennart van der Ziel, CEO - De la facultad de derecho al mundo de las start-ups, ha liderado múltiples equipos internacionales en consultoría tecnológica, ha lanzado satisfactoriamente varios productos de software, community builder, le encanta viajar.Nick NM Yap, CPO - Apasionado de los productos, más de 20 años de experiencia en la creación de productos en 3 continentes, innumerables viajes realizados, encontrar la esencia de viajar – ya sea por placer o por negocio – está en la conexión humana.Brend Kouwenhoven, COO - Combinando innovación, espíritu empresarial y finanzas para mejorar el mundo, más de 20 años de experiencia en corporaciones, gobierno y empresas, ahora utilizándolo para eliminar las barreras idiomáticas con Travis.

¿Qué metas ha alcanzado Travis?
La meta de financiación de 80,000$ fue alcanzada apenas tres días después de lanzar la campaña, el 25 de marzo. ¡El mismo día también logramos 100k$! Nuestro primer stretch goal fue de 250.000$, que se consiguió a finales de marzo. El movimiento se fue haciendo cada vez más grande por lo que anunciamos un nuevo stretch goal de 400.000 dólares, que luego se convirtió en medio millón gracias a más de 3.000 patrocinadores increíbles.
¿Qué características hemos añadido a Travis?
Prometimos que cuando alcanzáramos los $ 400k, introduciríamos tres nuevos idiomas en modo fuera de línea. Seguimos vuestras sugerencias e introducimos los idiomas que solicitaron: Cantonés, Vietnamita y Portugués brasileño. Otra adición fue la bolsa de protección para evitar el polvo y arañazos.

¿Cómo es posible traducir en tantos idiomas?
Travis utiliza motores de traducción de varias empresas con avanzada tecnología de traducción. Debido a eso somos capaces de ofrecer muchos más idiomas que cualquier otro motor, incluso más de 80. Elegimos 80 idiomas por precaución y planeamos expandirnos con actualizaciones futuras (gratuitas).


¿Es la traducción mejor que otras y cómo?
Es tan bueno como el mejor porque Travis elige los mejores motores de traducción para cada idioma. Dado que hemos integrado las mejores opciones en un producto, no tienes que preocuparte acerca de qué software de traducción utilizar.


¿Mejora la traducción con el tiempo?
Sí, los motores de traducción utilizan la inteligencia artificial y el aprendizaje automático para aprender patrones de traducción que mejoran con el tiempo. También estamos construyendo nuestra propia red neuronal para detectar el argot y los diferentes acentos. Es por eso que estamos comenzando este movimiento para los primeros adoptantes, ¡para que puedas ayudarnos a crear un mundo sin barreras de idiomas!


¿Hacen envíos a mi país?
Sí, hacemos envíos internacionales a cualquier localización.


¿Cuáles son los costos de entrega?
Después en el proceso del pre-pedido y después de seleccionar tu país de entrega, te informaremos sobre los gastos de envío.

¿Puedo hacer el pre-pedido si aún no estoy seguro de mi dirección de entrega?
Claro, siempre le pediremos su dirección antes de la entrega.


¿Habrán actualizaciones de software? ¿Son gratuitos?
Sí, Travis se actualizará frecuentemente y todas las actualizaciones serán gratuitas para los partidarios de Indiegogo.

Los auriculares no son incluidos con el producto, pero Travis es compatible con la mayoría de los auriculares con cable e inalámbricos, incluyendo Apple Airpods, por eso puedes usar cualquier marca o tipo.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">OUR STORY</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We have designed over 50 fidget products over the past 2 years and are now bringing our design aesthetic to the EDC and knife worlds. In just a few months, we have designed and produced 3 knives and have several more designed and being prototyped. The Wraith, Basilisk and Yokai have been very well received and we've got the youtube reviews to prove it!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">After designing several knives, I wanted to develop something that I could personally carry every day. I can't EDC my larger knives due to legal restrictions and working a white collar job means I have no need for a hard use knife.

INTRODUCING ONI!
The Oni is a mini knife measuring only 5 inches in length. It completes most tasks as efficiently as a full-sized knife—but at a fraction of the weight, and the size of a key Fob.


OUR STORY
We have designed over 50 fidget products over the past 2 years and are now bringing our design aesthetic to the EDC and knife worlds.

<p><a href=""http://www.alpineathena.com/editor-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: none;"" target=""_blank"" title=""Alpine Athena""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: georgia,times,serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 22px; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal;white-space:normal !important;""></span></a></p><p></p><a href=""http://www.surfcanyon.com/search?f=sl&amp;q=Samina%20Baig&amp;partner=wtiffusa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""scSearchLink"">Samina Baig</a>, first Pakistani female mountaineer and one of the creative and driving forces behind the Pakistan Youth Outreach, recently had to turn around 150m from the summit of a 6000m peak in the winter because she lacked one piece of crucial gear.  A piece of gear that most high altitude mountaineers don't think twice about having. A down suit.  A down suit stood between her and the summit.  The temperatures had plummeted dangerously low and without the proper equipment it was not safe to continue the climb.  Samina is just one example of the challenges women in Pakistan face mountaineering.  They overcome social limitations, lack of support, their own lack of confidence in themselves, and lack of funding to show that Pakistani women can do everything men can do, including climb a mountain.  The least of their concerns should be whether or not they can find a down suit to climb a mountain they are physically and mentally prepared for, including having all the proper mountaineering skills and experience.  And we, together, can change that to not only help Samina and the few other women mountaineers, but also help women see that they can be more than just the caretakers of the home and baby machines.<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Gear for Gals in Pakistan is a fundraising project founded by </strong><a href=""http://www.alpineathena.com/editor-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Genevieve Hathaway</a> <strong> to 1) raise money to bring women's climbing gear to the <a href=""http://www.pakyouthoutreach.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Pakistan Youth Outreach (PYO) organization</a>, an organization aiming to bring greater gender equality through training women as mountaineers and organizing all-women mountaineering expeditions in Pakistan, and 2) assist PYO in applying for <a href=""http://www.surfcanyon.com/search?f=sl&amp;q=climbing%20grants&amp;partner=wtiffusa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""scSearchLink"">climbing grants</a> to fund a Pakistani women's expedition climb of a 7000m peak in Pakistan during summer 2012.</strong></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This project is not just about climbing, it's about bringing greater rights to women in Pakistan.  Climbing and the outdoors is just one avenue to do that.  Mountaineering teaches self-reliance, confidence, team building skills, and shows women throughout Pakistan, not only those who participate in the PYO's mountaineering school, they are capable of more than just the domestic life. In many parts of Pakistan women cannot move around or leave their home without permission from a male relative and an escort. Much of Pakistan still has a long way to go in raising women to equal standing with men and reducing violence against women.  The school drop out rate for women is high at almost 50 percent.  In urban areas women only comprise 28% of the work force.  Violence against women in Pakistan is still a big problem, especially poorer areas, more rural regions and in the tribal areas.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>By getting more women into mountaineering it will create a ripple effect.  The women taught as mountaineers will then teach other women, through their interactions, that women have worth and can be strong, confident, independent, contributing members of society.  Helping one woman gain self-reliance and independence through mountaineering in turn helps many more.  On a larger scale, teaching women to mountaineer brings about greater gender equality by 1) demonstrating to Pakistani society that women are just as capable as men and 2) showing women throughout Pakistan that they are equal to men and deserve to be treated equally.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>By contributing to this project  what is the equivalent of 3 Starbucks cups of coffee or a dinner out you can help change a woman's life in Pakistan.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For the Pakistan Youth Outreach to continue training women mountaineers and organizing climbs they need additional gear and funding.  This gear and funding is critical.  That is where you the donor come in.  Your donations help the much needed climbing gear reach the PYO in Pakistan and for targeted grant applications to be developed and submitted.</p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Impact</h3>The Gear for Gals in Pakistan project will help Pakistan Youth Outreach (PYO) organization impact young Pakistani women's lives by empowering them through the skills and confidence they learn mountaineering.  The gear and grant applications will help PYO continue to train more and more women in mountaineering, and organize and execute all-women climbs.  These growing number of women mountaineers and all-women expeditions will inspire other women in Pakistan to participate in adventure sports and mountaineering.  It will also show women that they can be self-reliant, strong, confident and ambitious; encouraging young women not to be limited by societal constraints, but to challenge the status quo and strive for equality.  The aim is to not just change women's minds, but influence Pakistani society as a whole to think of women as equal members.    <br/><br/>PYO's influence is not limited to Pakistan. This organization is showing other countries that Pakistani women are not just the victims seen on tv.  There are major concerns in Pakistan with the level of violence committed against women.  But, that is not the whole story.  Women in Pakistan are organizing complex and challenging expedition climbs of 7000m mountains.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Climbing mountains is expensive and requires a lot of technical climbing gear.  The Gear for Gals in Pakistan project is raising $3500 to fund 1) transporting crucial women's climbing gear to the Pakistan Youth Outreach (PYO) organization in Pakistan and 2) developing content for <a href=""http://www.surfcanyon.com/search?f=sl&amp;q=climbing%20grants&amp;partner=wtiffusa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: none;"" target=""scSearchLink"">climbing grants</a> to fund an all-women's climb of a 7000m peak in Pakistan during July 2012 and grant application production and submission. Video, photography and written content will be developed and produced for the following grants: American Alpine Club, First Ascent, Mugs Stump 
Alpine Climbing Award, Balance Bar, Polartec, and National Geographic grants.<br/><br/>The $3500 covers the extra baggage and overweight baggage charges (which are quite hefty) by Continental and Omen <a href=""http://www.surfcanyon.com/search?f=sl&amp;q=Airlines&amp;partner=wtiffusa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: none;"" target=""scSearchLink"">Airlines</a>,  the expensive extra baggage charge for flying the gear from Islamabad to Shimshal where the climbing courses take place, custom fees to bring the gear into Pakistan, lens rental fees, cost to purchase an HD microphone, cost of video and photography editing software to produce grant application video content, and the administrative fees IndieGoGo charges to host this fundraiser on their website.<br/><br/>Why fly the gear over instead of ship it?  Climbing gear and <a href=""http://www.surfcanyon.com/search?f=sl&amp;q=clothing&amp;partner=wtiffusa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: none;"" target=""scSearchLink"">clothing</a>
 is difficult to purchase in Pakistan and just as difficult to ship due to shipping costs and customs regulations.  
Many gear companies and online stores do not ship to Pakistan and few stores 
in-country sell climbing gear. Also, theft of shipped items does occur when shipping to Pakistan,. The 
easier, more reliable and cost-effective method is for the gear to be 
flown to Pakistan via commercial <a href=""http://www.surfcanyon.com/search?f=sl&amp;q=airlines&amp;partner=wtiffusa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: none;"" target=""scSearchLink"">airlines</a>. <br/><br/>We need you to make this project a reality and help these Pakistani women! <br/><p><br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Samina Baig, first Pakistani female mountaineer and one of the creative and driving forces behind the Pakistan Youth Outreach, recently had to turn around 150m from the summit of a 6000m peak in the winter because she lacked one piece of crucial gear.  A piece of gear that most high altitude mountaineers don't think twice about having. A down suit.  A down suit stood between her and the summit.  The temperatures had plummeted dangerously low and without the proper equipment it was not safe to continue the climb.  Samina is just one example of the challenges women in Pakistan face mountaineering.  They overcome social limitations, lack of support, their own lack of confidence in themselves, and lack of funding to show that Pakistani women can do everything men can do, including climb a mountain.  The least of their concerns should be whether or not they can find a down suit to climb a mountain they are physically and mentally prepared for, including having all the proper mountaineering skills and experience.  And we, together, can change that to not only help Samina and the few other women mountaineers, but also help women see that they can be more than just the caretakers of the home and baby machines.

Gear for Gals in Pakistan is a fundraising project founded by Genevieve Hathaway  to 1) raise money to bring women's climbing gear to the Pakistan Youth Outreach (PYO) organization, an organization aiming to bring greater gender equality through training women as mountaineers and organizing all-women mountaineering expeditions in Pakistan, and 2) assist PYO in applying for climbing grants to fund a Pakistani women's expedition climb of a 7000m peak in Pakistan during summer 2012.

This project is not just about climbing, it's about bringing greater rights to women in Pakistan.  Climbing and the outdoors is just one avenue to do that.  Mountaineering teaches self-reliance, confidence, team building skills, and shows women throughout Pakistan, not only those who participate in the PYO's mountaineering school, they are capable of more than just the domestic life. In many parts of Pakistan women cannot move around or leave their home without permission from a male relative and an escort. Much of Pakistan still has a long way to go in raising women to equal standing with men and reducing violence against women.  The school drop out rate for women is high at almost 50 percent.  In urban areas women only comprise 28% of the work force.  Violence against women in Pakistan is still a big problem, especially poorer areas, more rural regions and in the tribal areas.

By getting more women into mountaineering it will create a ripple effect.  The women taught as mountaineers will then teach other women, through their interactions, that women have worth and can be strong, confident, independent, contributing members of society.  Helping one woman gain self-reliance and independence through mountaineering in turn helps many more.  On a larger scale, teaching women to mountaineer brings about greater gender equality by 1) demonstrating to Pakistani society that women are just as capable as men and 2) showing women throughout Pakistan that they are equal to men and deserve to be treated equally.

By contributing to this project  what is the equivalent of 3 Starbucks cups of coffee or a dinner out you can help change a woman's life in Pakistan.

For the Pakistan Youth Outreach to continue training women mountaineers and organizing climbs they need additional gear and funding.  This gear and funding is critical.  That is where you the donor come in.  Your donations help the much needed climbing gear reach the PYO in Pakistan and for targeted grant applications to be developed and submitted.


The ImpactThe Gear for Gals in Pakistan project will help Pakistan Youth Outreach (PYO) organization impact young Pakistani women's lives by empowering them through the skills and confidence they learn mountaineering.  The gear and grant applications will help PYO continue to train more and more women in mountaineering, and organize and execute all-women climbs.  These growing number of women mountaineers and all-women expeditions will inspire other women in Pakistan to participate in adventure sports and mountaineering.  It will also show women that they can be self-reliant, strong, confident and ambitious; encouraging young women not to be limited by societal constraints, but to challenge the status quo and strive for equality.  The aim is to not just change women's minds, but influence Pakistani society as a whole to think of women as equal members.    PYO's influence is not limited to Pakistan. This organization is showing other countries that Pakistani women are not just the victims seen on tv.  There are major concerns in Pakistan with the level of violence committed against women.  But, that is not the whole story.  Women in Pakistan are organizing complex and challenging expedition climbs of 7000m mountains.

What We Need & What You GetClimbing mountains is expensive and requires a lot of technical climbing gear.  The Gear for Gals in Pakistan project is raising $3500 to fund 1) transporting crucial women's climbing gear to the Pakistan Youth Outreach (PYO) organization in Pakistan and 2) developing content for climbing grants to fund an all-women's climb of a 7000m peak in Pakistan during July 2012 and grant application production and submission. Video, photography and written content will be developed and produced for the following grants: American Alpine Club, First Ascent, Mugs Stump 
Alpine Climbing Award, Balance Bar, Polartec, and National Geographic grants.The $3500 covers the extra baggage and overweight baggage charges (which are quite hefty) by Continental and Omen Airlines,  the expensive extra baggage charge for flying the gear from Islamabad to Shimshal where the climbing courses take place, custom fees to bring the gear into Pakistan, lens rental fees, cost to purchase an HD microphone, cost of video and photography editing software to produce grant application video content, and the administrative fees IndieGoGo charges to host this fundraiser on their website.Why fly the gear over instead of ship it?  Climbing gear and clothing
 is difficult to purchase in Pakistan and just as difficult to ship due to shipping costs and customs regulations.  
Many gear companies and online stores do not ship to Pakistan and few stores 
in-country sell climbing gear. Also, theft of shipped items does occur when shipping to Pakistan,. The 
easier, more reliable and cost-effective method is for the gear to be 
flown to Pakistan via commercial airlines. We need you to make this project a reality and help these Pakistani women! 
Every donation helps, no matter how small. And to say thank you, we have a few thank you gifts at different donation levels that include: a postcard from Pakistan, a high quality print of the women this program helps, dinner and a speaker on this project, traditional crafts from Pakistan, and much more.  See side column for furhter details.

<p><br/>If we go over our goal, I will spend the additional funds on creating an outdoor kitchen with a cob oven for myself and my siblings who are restoring some log cabins nearby.  If we do not reach out goal, we will still use and appreciate all we recieve and keep building!</p>
<p> In the end, we hope to create an uplifting, peaceful, shelter that has minimal impact on it's surroundings, and educate local residents and family about natural building techniques that they most likely have never heard of.  And have a great time doing it!</p>

If we go over our goal, I will spend the additional funds on creating an outdoor kitchen with a cob oven for myself and my siblings who are restoring some log cabins nearby.  If we do not reach out goal, we will still use and appreciate all we recieve and keep building!
 In the end, we hope to create an uplifting, peaceful, shelter that has minimal impact on it's surroundings, and educate local residents and family about natural building techniques that they most likely have never heard of.  And have a great time doing it!

<p><font><font></font></font></p>
<p>The Hollow Earth theory is much older than it may seem. The idea that the Earth has a void inside was suggested by the ancient philosophers and scientists. Of course, this idea was based on myths and beliefs of ancient people. Almost every ancient religion had its underworld, a mysterious place that was located literally under our feet. The Greek Tartarus, the Jewish Sheol, the Christian Hell - they all are interpretations of incipient Hollow Earth theory by our ancestors that explained every unclear phenomenon by means of religion. The idea of a subterranean realm is also mentioned in Tibetan Buddhism belief, where it is referred as Shamballa.</p>
<p>These and many other religions, so dispersed in time and space, have in common a certain world structure, and the emptiness under the ground is its essential part, as well as the opportunity to get into it. The Bible is also ambiguous when it comes to this issue: “Then God said, ""Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."" God made the expanse, and separated the waters which were below the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.” (Genesis, 1:6-7)</p>
<p>The first man to justify the Hollow Earth theory scientifically was Edmond Halley, the famous British astronomer who is best known for computing the orbit of the comet that is now named after him. In 1692, he put forth the idea that the Earth has more than one magnetic field, each with its force and orientation. His conclusive theory stated that there are four concentric spheres with their own magnetic fields.</p>
<p><font><font></font></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/67265/files/20130911014800-_-_.jpg?1378889280"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><font><font></font></font></p>
<p>Halley's longest shot was the suggestion that inner atmospheres separated these shells. He envisaged each inner region as being luminous (and possibly inhabited). Halley backed up his theory with Aurora Borealis that was caused by gas escaping from the inner Earth through polar holes.</p>
<p>Halley was the early pioneer of the Hollow Earth theory, and all his disciples used his ideas as a basis for their own research. In the 18th century Leonhard Euler, a great mathematician, restructured Halley's hypothesis. In his opinion, under the Earth crust and magma layers there was one hollow sphere. He assumed that there was another sun inside this sphere 600 miles across to provide light for an inner-Earth civilization. Another well-known mathematician, Sir John Leslie, also supported the inner sun theory - in fact, in his opinion, there were two inner suns that he named Pluto and Proserpine.</p>
<p>One of the most ardent supporters of the Hollow Earth theory was John Cleves Symmes Jr., an American army officer.</p>
<p><font><font></font></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/67270/files/20130911015336-WIog9UzRozo.jpg?1378889616"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><font><font></font></font></p>
<p>He was absolutely sure that inside our planet there is a shell with openings at both poles (4000 miles across on the North Pole and 6000 - on the South Pole). Symmes spent most of his wealth and a considerable part of his life to promote his theory. In April 1818 he sent out 500 copies of his message to US congressmen, university presidents and leading scientists. It said: “TO ALL THE WORLD! I declare the earth is hollow, and habitable within; containing a number of solid concentric spheres, one within the other, and that it is open at the poles 12 or 16 degrees; I pledge my life in support of this truth, and am ready to explore the hollow, if the world will support and aid me in the undertaking. I ask one hundred brave companions, well equipped, to start from Siberia in the fall season, with reindeer and sleighs, on the ice of the frozen sea: I engage we find a warm and rich land, stocked with thrifty vegetables and animals if not men, on reaching one degree northward of latitude 82.” This address, however, was taken for a ride; Symmes' efforts were lost in vain, but his belief made the Hollow Earth theory very popular.</p>
<p>In 1846, an extinct woolly mammoth was discovered frozen in Siberian ice. Another Hollow Earth theory enthusiast, Marshall Gardner, used it as evidence of this theory. He suggested that the mammoth was so well preserved because it had died recently. Gardner thought that mammoths and other extinct creatures wandered freely in the interior of the earth. This one had wandered outside by using the hole at the North Pole, then was frozen and carried to Siberia on an ice flow.</p>
<p>Gardner was also the first to design a realistic model of Hollow Earth with an interior shell; he even patented his model. In fact, Gardner's theory was one of the most scientifically grounded. In 1913, he affirmed that neither Frederick Cook, nor Robert Peary managed to reach the geographic North Pole and that the decisions of the scientific community in this concern are inaccurate and conventional. The results of Cook and Peary's expeditions are still controversial.</p>
<p>Miguel Serrano, Chilean politician and Antarctic explorer, in his article expressed his firm belief in the existence of the underground world. ""It is important to study and develop the arguments of the hollow earth theory. I see them only as a repetition or revival of the ancient idea, set out in many myths and legends. In my belief, the earth is split into two parts and bent inward, so that anyone who enters the 83rd degrees north or south latitude, does not see what is inside the planet. The force of gravity lies in the middle of the earth's crust, which has a thickness of 800 miles. On the back of the earth's crust could be continents and seas, forests, mountains and rivers, which are inhabited by one in the old days had come back in the development of our superior race.""</p>
<p>Not only scientists supported the Hollow Earth theory. In 1930-40's German Nazis had organized several expeditions to the poles. It is documented that Nazi submarines have found a huge system of landlocked cavities forming shells with warm air near Queen Maud Land. The above-mentioned Serrano suggested that part of the Nazi officers were evacuated to these shelters shortly before the end of the World War II.</p>

<p>Karl Dönitz, German naval commander, gave a speech in front of a German submarine in 1944, when he claimed ""The German submarine fleet is proud of having built an invisible fortification for the Fuhrer, anywhere in the world."" Historians affirm that at the end of the war three submarines were loaded with Nazi officers and relics of the Third Reich and transported to the Antarctic. After this, the empty submarines surrendered to the Allies in Mar del Plata, Argentine.</p>
<p>In 1946-47, US Navy organized the Operation Highjump to research the Nazi activity in the Antarctic. Rear admiral Richard E. Byrd conducted the operation. After several months of work, aerial photography and polar station establishing, the expedition members reported of being attacked by an unidentified enemy. In March 1947 all works were aborted, and the expedition came back to the United States. The documents were immediately classified. Only the next year newspapers started writing about 68 dead members of the crew and heavy damage to planes and ships. In his report to the presidential panel, admiral Byrd spoke about some strange flying objects that came from under the ground. After his report, Byrd was forcedly put into mental health facility for 5 years. It's worth mentioning that he was released and granted a leading post in the US Navy, when mass media was no longer interested in this story. So, government did not consider him crazy after all. Nowadays admiral Byrd's diary is one of the proofs of the Hollow Earth theory.</p>

Hello my name is Ernest Harris and I am the creator of Da'Strap, my son Jahi Harris is the heart and  promotion behind Da'Strap. My motivation behind Da'Strap was just to create a product that made skateboarding more enjoyable for the user ! I can say I started paying attention to skateboarders, and the problems they were having holding they're boards back in 1999, and realizing it was problem that could be solved. So I started creating a way of holding the board via a strap. I went thru numerous designs, until 13 years later, I was finally satisfied. I applied for my U.S. Patent, and it was granted. And with the help of my son, we presented Da'Strap to the public.

You reach the airport and scan the check-in area for a luggage tag on which you can quickly jot down your contact information. Either you don’t find one or if you do you may end up not having time enough to write your contact information in a readable manner before you reach the check in counter for your luggage – sounds familiar? </p><p>This exact scenario played itself out over and over for my wife and I when we were flying. Finally, on a trip to Paris my wife and I said to each other: Clearly there must be an easier solution for this. But there wasn't, so we created Tagonce.</p><p><b>What is Tagonce?</b></p><p>Imagine that...  </p><p></p><ul>

Troop 204 is the oldest scout troop in Lafayette and has graduated over 350 Eagle Scouts, whose projects contributed over 35,000 hours of community service. For many years, the Troop has been setting aside surplus funds raised from the annual wreath &amp; spray sales in anticipation of a major cabin update, but it's not enough to complete the project. We are appealing to all Troop families, 204 alumni, and friends in the Lafayette and Scouting communities to help save our cabin. </p>

</div> <div> <h3></h3>

<h3>Major Foundational Work Required.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>While basic cabin maintenance has been performed as a yearly tradition, Mother Nature and the passage of time have deteriorated the concrete foundation. The cabin, for years now, has literally been sinking into the ground. It’s time to intervene—time to act before the slanted walls and cracked foundation present safety issues or worsen beyond repair.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Due to the level of damage and the impending winter weather, construction has already begun on the foundation. The plans call for the foundation to be replaced and underpinned, the cabin to be re-leveled, and a new slab to be poured. It also needs new drainage and sewer lines, upgraded electrical systems, and other necessary code upgrades. The hope is that our building will retain its original log cabin charm, but with enough structural integrity to last well beyond another 60 years. We have gone through a detailed bidding process and awarded the contract to a highly reliable and respected contractor. The total cost of the project is estimated to be $270,000. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/869354/files/20140919170047-cabin_20070915cabin1.jpg?1411171247"" src="""" style=""width: 308px; height: 308px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/869355/files/20140919170101-cabin_20070915cabin6.jpg?1411171261"" src="""" style=""width: 308px; height: 308px;""/><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Construction of the cabin in 1948. </i></p>
<p>In keeping with the Scout oath of thriftiness, the Lafayette Dads Club has been saving their wreath sales’ fundraising surplus for over 30 years. By tapping deep into their reserves, they are able to contribute $100,000 toward the $270,000 cost without fully depleting the Troop's annual operating expenses.</p>
<p>Contributions made prior to the launch of this campaign have already closed the needed fundraising gap to $100,000. We are now appealing to all Troop families, 204 alumni, and friends to help save our cabin. Since we know that a number of contributors would prefer to donate appreciated stock or pay by check, we have set the Indiegogo fundraising target at $50,000. We hope that you feel like we do—that the cabin is worth saving, and that the future of Troop 204 is worth investing in. We are grateful for your support and generosity. </p>

</div></div>","Summary The 66 year-old Troop 204 scout cabin requires a new foundation and other repairs to be safe for future generations of scouts. Troop 204 is the oldest scout troop in Lafayette and has graduated over 350 Eagle Scouts, whose projects contributed over 35,000 hours of community service. For many years, the Troop has been setting aside surplus funds raised from the annual wreath & spray sales in anticipation of a major cabin update, but it's not enough to complete the project. We are appealing to all Troop families, 204 alumni, and friends in the Lafayette and Scouting communities to help save our cabin. 

The Troop 204 cabin at School St. & First St. in Lafayette, CA.
  

Major Foundational Work Required.

While basic cabin maintenance has been performed as a yearly tradition, Mother Nature and the passage of time have deteriorated the concrete foundation. The cabin, for years now, has literally been sinking into the ground. It’s time to intervene—time to act before the slanted walls and cracked foundation present safety issues or worsen beyond repair.


Due to the level of damage and the impending winter weather, construction has already begun on the foundation. The plans call for the foundation to be replaced and underpinned, the cabin to be re-leveled, and a new slab to be poured. It also needs new drainage and sewer lines, upgraded electrical systems, and other necessary code upgrades. The hope is that our building will retain its original log cabin charm, but with enough structural integrity to last well beyond another 60 years. We have gone through a detailed bidding process and awarded the contract to a highly reliable and respected contractor. The total cost of the project is estimated to be $270,000. 
 Construction of the cabin in 1948. 
In keeping with the Scout oath of thriftiness, the Lafayette Dads Club has been saving their wreath sales’ fundraising surplus for over 30 years. By tapping deep into their reserves, they are able to contribute $100,000 toward the $270,000 cost without fully depleting the Troop's annual operating expenses.
Contributions made prior to the launch of this campaign have already closed the needed fundraising gap to $100,000. We are now appealing to all Troop families, 204 alumni, and friends to help save our cabin. Since we know that a number of contributors would prefer to donate appreciated stock or pay by check, we have set the Indiegogo fundraising target at $50,000. We hope that you feel like we do—that the cabin is worth saving, and that the future of Troop 204 is worth investing in. We are grateful for your support and generosity.

Most products built today are not meant to last and create large amounts of unnecessary waste. We've grown accustomed to using our clothes and other accessories for a few months, maybe two years tops. Here at ALPAKA, we like to do things a little bit differently. All of our gear is engineered to last. We believe in constructing high-quality goods that will make you feel proud to wear them. The Stealth Belt is no exception. We invite you to keep reading on to discover why this belt could be the travel solution you've been looking for.  The Stealth Belt is an anti-theft belt that looks and functions like a normal belt but is equipped with cleverly hidden compartments that allow you to completely conceal your cash or keys. It's also adjustable (one size fits all from 24"" to 38"") and easy to use. Larger sizing (> 38) available at the end of campaign. It's also great whenever you have..ahem..an emergency (yeah, we went there) and need to quickly unbuckle it. Simply lift the pull tab and boom, it's unbuckled. Since the buckle is magnetic, it's just as easy to buckle it back up.   The Fidlock buckle is constructed from nylon 66, fibreglass and rustproof stainless steel.  DEMO Have you ever found yourself having to change your SIM while overseas but not being able to find a pin to eject the tray? The Stealth Belt comes with a SIM Tray Pin Pull Tab so you never have to deal with this problem again. You can also store a SIM card inside the pull tab.   But that's not all. The Stealth Belt wouldn't be complete with a travel system. There are 3 extra components to the belt that will make your travel experience a breeze. This is the Stealth Belt System:   The Magnetic Cardholder eliminates the need for a lanyard and simplifies the way you commute. It's also great for holding ID cards for work, etc.It's sustainable as it's mostly made from upcycled materials from our other products. We're bringing you the Stealth Belt Travel System at a very affordable price.

<p>Spilling your shampoo all over everything is the worst and mixing all of your toiletries together is way gross.

<p><b>Here's The Solution:</b></p>
<p>We designed a toiletry bag that stays slim whilst packing a ton of toiletries in an organized manner with six separate pockets. We've used only premium materials so it is very rugged/sturdy, cleans easily, and just feels fantastic in your hands. We're super excited about this! Here's why:</p>
<ul><li>
<b>Deodorant &amp; Razor Pocket</b> - A mesh pocket with a curved zipper for easy access. It fits all deodorant stick sizes. There is room for a razor and whatever small items you can pack inside (i.e. contact case). (9” Length x 3.5” Wide)</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Toothbrush &amp; Toothpaste Pocket</b> -  A waterproof toothbrush &amp; travel size toothpaste pocket. This pocket is solely for your toothbrush in order to keep your toothbrush from gathering debris &amp; from rubbing up against anything but your pearly whites. (9” Length x 1.5” Wide)</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Large Outer Pocket w/Soft Fleece Lining</b> - This pocket spans the length of the back of the pack and has a soft fleece lining to protect valuables. Store your phone, watch, passport, cords, etc. (7” Length x 5” Wide)</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Deep Pocket</b> - A mesh pocket to fit your essentials. Pack this how you’d like! We were able to easily fit a travel mouth wash, beard oil, q-tips, mustache wax, flossers, and finger nail clippers. Psst ladies - this pocket fits tampons! The pocket is 5” wide so your tampons slide in and out easily. (5” Length x 5” Wide) </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Deep Waterproof Pocket</b> - Store your liquids here to ensure that you don’t arrive to your destination with a shampoo explosion all over everything. Use travel size containers to fit shampoo &amp; body wash. (4” Length x 5” Wide)</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Secret Small Pocket</b> -  Well I guess this pocket isn’t a secret anymore is it? This pocket is inside the deodorant &amp; razor pocket. It can store rings or other small items that you want to keep from sliding around in one of the bigger pockets. (3” Length x 2” Wide)</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Stowaway Adjustable Strap With Buckle</b> - Sometimes it’s just convenient to hang your toiletry bag. We built a special pocket on the back of the toiletry bag with a stowaway strap &amp; buckle. This pocket sits behind the large outer pocket to maximize storage space. Now your toiletry bag can hang anywhere or lay flat, neat huh? (Each strap is 8 1/2” Long. Pocket is 3 1/2” Tall x 5” Wide)</li></ul>
<div>We are also so confident in the bag's build that we also cover this bag under a lifetime warranty!</div>

<p>Chris and Lance met in August of 2016. Chris confronted Lance at a party and Chris had the idea for a toiletry pack for a while but really wanted to work with a designer to make sure he could have the best product possible. So when he found out that Lance was a designer and Lance had launched many products in the past Chris wanted to meet him and pitch him his idea. </p>
<p>Lance thought it was a great idea and Chris and Lance became the best of friends. Chris and Lance then went on to design, sew their own samples, hold focus groups, start over from scratch, design, and re-design again until they came up with this final production sample!</p>

</div></div>","Premium materials, organized, and low profile. Everything you'll ever need in a toiletry bag!We launched this campaign for the Explorer SLIM in 2017 and are shipping this bag now from our website www.workbygravel.com.   
    Back Of Bag  The Premium Toiletry Pack is the best toiletry bag ever designed. It's sleek, sturdy, and adaptable. It was designed to keep your toiletries organized nicely while you travel. We've designed this to solve some of the top problems we've experienced (or seen others experience) while traveling.   Here's The Problem:We often find that people are currently carrying their toiletries in plastic bags, bulky cases, and even foregoing a toiletry bag all together and just packing their toiletries in random nooks and crannies of their main travel bags. Toiletry bags on the market often have no organization options and feature just one or maybe two compartments.   
Spilling your shampoo all over everything is the worst and mixing all of your toiletries together is way gross. One of our least favorite thoughts is picturing our nail clippers rubbing up against our toothbrush. Why should your toothbrush be in the same pocket as your toenail clippers? We thought there had to be a much better way.


 
Here's The Solution:
We designed a toiletry bag that stays slim whilst packing a ton of toiletries in an organized manner with six separate pockets. We've used only premium materials so it is very rugged/sturdy, cleans easily, and just feels fantastic in your hands. We're super excited about this! Here's why:

Deodorant & Razor Pocket - A mesh pocket with a curved zipper for easy access. It fits all deodorant stick sizes. There is room for a razor and whatever small items you can pack inside (i.e. contact case). (9” Length x 3.5” Wide)

Toothbrush & Toothpaste Pocket -  A waterproof toothbrush & travel size toothpaste pocket. This pocket is solely for your toothbrush in order to keep your toothbrush from gathering debris & from rubbing up against anything but your pearly whites. (9” Length x 1.5” Wide)

Large Outer Pocket w/Soft Fleece Lining - This pocket spans the length of the back of the pack and has a soft fleece lining to protect valuables. Store your phone, watch, passport, cords, etc. (7” Length x 5” Wide)

Deep Pocket - A mesh pocket to fit your essentials. Pack this how you’d like! We were able to easily fit a travel mouth wash, beard oil, q-tips, mustache wax, flossers, and finger nail clippers. Psst ladies - this pocket fits tampons! The pocket is 5” wide so your tampons slide in and out easily. (5” Length x 5” Wide) 

Deep Waterproof Pocket - Store your liquids here to ensure that you don’t arrive to your destination with a shampoo explosion all over everything. Use travel size containers to fit shampoo & body wash. (4” Length x 5” Wide)

Secret Small Pocket -  Well I guess this pocket isn’t a secret anymore is it? This pocket is inside the deodorant & razor pocket. It can store rings or other small items that you want to keep from sliding around in one of the bigger pockets. (3” Length x 2” Wide)

Stowaway Adjustable Strap With Buckle - Sometimes it’s just convenient to hang your toiletry bag. We built a special pocket on the back of the toiletry bag with a stowaway strap & buckle. This pocket sits behind the large outer pocket to maximize storage space. Now your toiletry bag can hang anywhere or lay flat, neat huh? (Each strap is 8 1/2” Long. Pocket is 3 1/2” Tall x 5” Wide)
We are also so confident in the bag's build that we also cover this bag under a lifetime warranty!

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
Premium Materials & Durability
We used premium materials and didn't cut any corners. 


Outer Shell - The bag's outer shell is made from Tarpaulin PVC (Non Toxic & the same material used in many dry bags). This bag will take a beating, wash easily, and stay light to reduce weight in your pack.

Mesh - We used a Poly & PVC mesh to keep it very washable and durable.

Toothbrush Pocket + Lower Waterproof Pocket Lining - TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) to keep these pockets sealed off from the rest of the bag.

Inside Lining - Poly & TPE (Thermoplastic Elastomer).

Weight - 7.23 oz

Every VSSL is perfectly stocked with over 70 pieces of essential outdoor gear that doesn't compromise on quality, weight, or valuable pack space. It’s like the Swiss army knife of camp gear, and it'll change the way you prepare for outdoor adventure. 
 
  Outdoor gear is in a constant state of innovation, getting lighter and easier to pack, except when it comes to the camping essentials. This is the stuff that can make or break a trip. You know the essentials checklist; a flashlight, a way to start a fire, purify water, bandage a wound, rope for a dry line, and tape to repair gear. There hasn't been a way to keep all these critical items ultra-packable, organized, and in one place for easy access, until now. 
 
  Packing every last inch of VSSL Camp with useful gear has been our obsession for over three years. But not just any gear. We’ve found the right mix of quality, functional gear that you’d want on you anytime you head out into the wild. Each piece has been carefully chosen and organized into clearly labeled screw top containers, so you know exactly where your essential gear is when you need it most.

SUMMARY
As electronics get smaller, more sophisticated and cheaper, pinhole cameras are no longer exclusive to James Bond kind of secret agents or the law enforcement, but easily accessible to everyone, including those who have an agenda against you. Your privacy, therefore, is more at risk than ever.


Spy Cameras today come in very small sizes and all sorts of forms.
 

 
Out of this Craziness, we create hope, hope in the name of VESANY.


 
WIRELESS DETECTION
VESANY detects a wide range of wireless signals, 100MHz to 6GHz, within 3m/10ft., leaving spy cams, wireless trackers, GPS locators etc. nowhere to hide.

INFRARED SCANNING
After making sure there is wireless signal emitting, use the infrared scanning feature to quickly locate the source of the signal. Camera lens will reflect the infrared light, which is how VESANY pinpoints the spy cameras.

 
ANTI BREAK-IN ALERT
VESANY boasts a sensitive motion sensor, which detects even every slight movements. Hang it off the door knob of your hotel room, so you can enjoy a night of sound sleep. If somebody tries to break in, VESANY picks up the movements and sets off a high-pitched alarm and a red glare immediately, effectively fending off the perpetrators.

 
ANTI THEFT ALERT
 When traveling, you have to have some luggage, be it a handy little brief case or a few big trunks. They may or may not be very valuable, but losing one of these could put you in big troubles for the rest of the journey. Hang it off your luggage while you're occupied and couldn't keep an eye on it. Anyone tries to move it will trigger the alarm.

 
COMPACT & LASTING
When designing VESANY, we had traveling in mind. We knew it had to be compact and portable with a long battery life, and last but not the least, stylish. Now with VESANY, you can travel with safety, security and in style.

 
DO NOT FALL VICTIM OF HIDDEN CAMERAS

At the time, our goal was to develop the best athletic t-shirt in the world and we think we delivered just that. Then, we saw you using the t-shirt as daily wear and for traveling light, so the products that followed were geared towards everyday performance. With this new generation, we bring to you a t-shirt engineered with our most advanced and versatile fabric yet, and one that is simply a joy to wear day and night.</p><h1>Product Details</h1><p>Every bit of this product is custom made. To start, we created a double sided fabric with merino wool on the inside for its ability to regulate temperature, manage moisture, and resist odor. We use premium grade 17.5 micron fibers which are ultra fine and feel incredibly soft against the skin.</p><div data-id=""22062415""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1536258158/cco6owclijzr3tavyzzo.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>While merino wool is bacteriostatic and offers a first layer of protection against odor, we add pure silver (in the form of metallic yarns) which we find to be the most effective solution for neutralizing odor causing bacteria. The production of our SilverAir yarn begins at the molecular level where the metallic formulation is precisely controlled and is free of nickel and other heavy metals. Unlike chemical and nano treatments, our silver is permanently knit into the fabric and will never wash away. When you turn the product inside-out, you can actually see the silver throughout.</p><div data-id=""22078153""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1536258158/zvpmmpe7wkzmvix4ftce.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>To complete the fabric, we plait the exterior with nylon for a durable finish and a beautiful hand feel. The strength of the nylon perfectly complements the lightweight merino. We use an open knit structure that is airy and breathable to create an extremely light but sturdy t-shirt that weighs less than 120 grams (in a medium size).</p><div data-id=""22062417""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1536258159/ejvv58xdkew5elofcmyr.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>You'll love wearing it by itself in warm weather, and it makes a fantastic base layer during the winter. Best of all, it is highly packable and lets you travel light without the burden of heavy luggage. You can comfortably fit two t-shirts, two pairs of socks, and two underwear in a small packing cube that will fit any bag.</p><div data-id=""22140066""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1536258160/fnvddpijemvrq0r7hksw.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>We wanted to appeal to a wide range of style, in a variety of conditions. As with all our products, the main focus is always on the material and construction. The body of the t-shirt is seamless, so it is void of any stitching. It has a pure uninterrupted form with mesh knit in the underarms and two clean jacquard lines down the back. The sleeves are stitched to the body using flat-lock seams to prevent chafing, and follows a raglan construction to enable better mobility of the arms while sitting cleanly over the shoulders.</p><div data-id=""22078384""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1536258160/ciyezxpe4vc2x8irmqsd.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>With each new iteration, we continuously strive to simplify and improve a product based on your demands.

At the time, our goal was to develop the best athletic t-shirt in the world and we think we delivered just that. Then, we saw you using the t-shirt as daily wear and for traveling light, so the products that followed were geared towards everyday performance. With this new generation, we bring to you a t-shirt engineered with our most advanced and versatile fabric yet, and one that is simply a joy to wear day and night.Product DetailsEvery bit of this product is custom made. To start, we created a double sided fabric with merino wool on the inside for its ability to regulate temperature, manage moisture, and resist odor. We use premium grade 17.5 micron fibers which are ultra fine and feel incredibly soft against the skin. While merino wool is bacteriostatic and offers a first layer of protection against odor, we add pure silver (in the form of metallic yarns) which we find to be the most effective solution for neutralizing odor causing bacteria. The production of our SilverAir yarn begins at the molecular level where the metallic formulation is precisely controlled and is free of nickel and other heavy metals. Unlike chemical and nano treatments, our silver is permanently knit into the fabric and will never wash away. When you turn the product inside-out, you can actually see the silver throughout. To complete the fabric, we plait the exterior with nylon for a durable finish and a beautiful hand feel. The strength of the nylon perfectly complements the lightweight merino. We use an open knit structure that is airy and breathable to create an extremely light but sturdy t-shirt that weighs less than 120 grams (in a medium size). You'll love wearing it by itself in warm weather, and it makes a fantastic base layer during the winter. Best of all, it is highly packable and lets you travel light without the burden of heavy luggage. You can comfortably fit two t-shirts, two pairs of socks, and two underwear in a small packing cube that will fit any bag. We wanted to appeal to a wide range of style, in a variety of conditions. As with all our products, the main focus is always on the material and construction. The body of the t-shirt is seamless, so it is void of any stitching. It has a pure uninterrupted form with mesh knit in the underarms and two clean jacquard lines down the back. The sleeves are stitched to the body using flat-lock seams to prevent chafing, and follows a raglan construction to enable better mobility of the arms while sitting cleanly over the shoulders. With each new iteration, we continuously strive to simplify and improve a product based on your demands. We believe the SilverAir Merino T-Shirt is the epitome of everything we have learned so far. We can't wait for you to try it!  Image Gallery

Knife manufacturers have been trying to address the same problems for centuries. The steel may be too soft – the knife edge dulls too quickly – and they need lots of maintenance. But until now, nothing has really changed.</p><p>So we began our search for a way to move knife-making forward into the 21st century. Our search led us to a patented metal alloy matrix that was developed by Cal-Tech and tested by NASA. We acquired the rights to use this material in the world of bushcraft and survival knives – and our <strong>Ultimatedge Knife </strong>is the result.</p><p>We strongly believe this will reinvent the outdoor knife industry and become the NEW standard for excellence in this field.</p><div data-id=""22191299""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1539702311/cwqce0jsfhgkjyt6clnj.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>Sharpness is THE most critical attribute for any outdoor knife. And the knife edge angle is one of the most critical factors that determines sharpness. The harder the material, the sharper the blade edge.</p><p>But in ordinary steel knives, a higher level of hardness also makes the knife edge harder to maintain – and the edge chips easily.</p><p>The <strong>Ultimatedge Knife</strong> edge is made from a patented metal alloy matrix – which we call <strong>LIQUIDIAMOND®</strong> – that was developed by <strong>Cal-Tech</strong> and <strong>NASA</strong>. Now we have made it even better by adding <strong>DLC </strong>(Diamond-Like Carbon)<strong> – </strong>and then combined this matrix with tungsten. It's harder than any steel, yet isn't brittle and resists rust.</p><p>The hardness of a metal alloy is measured in various ways. VERY expensive knives, costing hundreds of dollars, are made from higher carbon steel that is brittle and can chip easily. The <strong>Ultimatedge Knife blows away the competition by scoring well above others on the Vickers Scale without the brittle downside</strong>.</p><p>As we have said, the harder the material is, the sharper the blade that can be made from it.

It holds its edge better and longer due to the hardness of the metal alloy matrix mixed with tungsten. The combination of hardness, high elasticity, and corrosion resistance make the metal alloy matrix edge highly wear-resistant.</p><p>Most knives in this category aim for a combined cutting angle of between 38 and 45 degrees. The <strong>Ultimatedge Knife </strong>has an aggressive <strong>35-degree</strong> combined cutting angle. What does this mean? The sharper the angle, the easier and more precise the cut.

It lasts 10 times longer than other knives in this category.
The LIQUIDIAMOND® edge is made with a patented metal alloy matrix developed by NASA and Cal-Tech – and now with Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) added – then combined with tungsten to produce a cutting edge second to none.
This special metal alloy is twice as strong as titanium.
We have licensed this patented alloy for use with the Ultimatedge Knife. No one else has these rights for this knife category.
This is a better knife and better value than knives costing hundreds more. Be among the first to have one.
Multiple bushcraft and survival knife experts have tested our prototype and have given it rave reviews.
If you're going to spend serious time outdoors, then the indispensable tool you must have is a top-flight bushcraft and survival knife.  At Ultimatedge Knives, we sadly learned that very little has changed in knife-making in over 100 years. Knife manufacturers have been trying to address the same problems for centuries. The steel may be too soft – the knife edge dulls too quickly – and they need lots of maintenance. But until now, nothing has really changed.So we began our search for a way to move knife-making forward into the 21st century. Our search led us to a patented metal alloy matrix that was developed by Cal-Tech and tested by NASA. We acquired the rights to use this material in the world of bushcraft and survival knives – and our Ultimatedge Knife is the result.We strongly believe this will reinvent the outdoor knife industry and become the NEW standard for excellence in this field.Sharpness is THE most critical attribute for any outdoor knife. And the knife edge angle is one of the most critical factors that determines sharpness. The harder the material, the sharper the blade edge.But in ordinary steel knives, a higher level of hardness also makes the knife edge harder to maintain – and the edge chips easily.The Ultimatedge Knife edge is made from a patented metal alloy matrix – which we call LIQUIDIAMOND® – that was developed by Cal-Tech and NASA. Now we have made it even better by adding DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) – and then combined this matrix with tungsten. It's harder than any steel, yet isn't brittle and resists rust.The hardness of a metal alloy is measured in various ways. VERY expensive knives, costing hundreds of dollars, are made from higher carbon steel that is brittle and can chip easily. The Ultimatedge Knife blows away the competition by scoring well above others on the Vickers Scale without the brittle downside.As we have said, the harder the material is, the sharper the blade that can be made from it. Here is a cutting test analysis illustrating the hardness and durability of the Ultimatedge Knife with its Amorphous Diamond Edge.Most importantly, what this means for YOU is the Ultimatedge Knife surpasses any production knife on the market in this category. It holds its edge better and longer due to the hardness of the metal alloy matrix mixed with tungsten. The combination of hardness, high elasticity, and corrosion resistance make the metal alloy matrix edge highly wear-resistant.Most knives in this category aim for a combined cutting angle of between 38 and 45 degrees. The Ultimatedge Knife has an aggressive 35-degree combined cutting angle. What does this mean? The sharper the angle, the easier and more precise the cut. And isn't that what you want when safety and certainty are at stake when you are outdoors?The Ultimatedge Knife Is Ultra Sharp and Lasts 10x Longer Than Ordinary Knives.This is the “super secret sauce” that sets our bushcraft and survival knife apart from the competition – and makes it the Gold Standard for outdoor safety and survival for bushcrafters, hunters, campers, hikers and survivalists.The patented metal alloy matrix edge possesses a natural nano-serration at the molecular level. This serration is like microscopic, ultra-hard “teeth” that make the effortless and breath-taking cutting power of the Ultimatedge Knife possible.Unlike other knives that often are doing little more than “crushing” the object at hand, our knife is actually cutting the object, with an effective slicing motion.Nano-serration on the knife edge makes the Ultimatedge Knife incredibly sharp!Another benefit of this nano-serration is the self-sharpening aspect of the microscopic teeth. As the knife is used, these tiny teeth are exposed and essentially sharpen themselves – and this is part of what allows the Ultimatedge Knife to retain its ultimate edge far longer than other knives.On July 5, 2018, a Provisional Patent was filed regarding our Self-Sharpening, Serrated Edge.It wasn’t enough for us to just acquire the use of the NASA-tested metal alloy matrix. We also needed access to a process for bonding the metal alloy matrix and tungsten cutting edge to the high-quality steel knife blank (2cr14N) that would comprise the rest of the Ultimatedge Knife. Fortunately, we were able to do so.This required the time and arduous effort to perfect what you see shown in the following video clip. This unique bonding process produces a cutting edge like no other.The patent-pending edge bonding process is part of what sets the Ultimatedge Knife apart and makes it possible for it to become the new Gold Standard of excellence in the bushcraft and survival knife field.We believe the combination of the metal alloy matrix and this bonding process will revolutionize the knife-making industry. YOU can be one of the first consumers to experience this Ultimatedge Knife.While our bushcraft and survival knife reinvents the category with its revolutionary cutting edge, there are still proven knife features that matter – and we have made certain they are part of the Ultimatedge Knife. Here are some of those important features:
The tip is sharp and detailed for piercing, drilling and carving.
This is a full-tang, fixed-blade knife.
It has a conveniently placed lanyard hole.
There is a thumb ramp.
It has a finger choil for control.
The handle is made from G-10 and is ergonomically designed for a superior grip.
And for those who want the “drill-down details” about the Ultimatedge Knife, here they are:Dimensions:
Total length: 235.5 mm
Blade length: 99.0 mm
Blade width: 37.5 mm
Blade thickness: 4.0 mm
Edge Material:
70% tungsten and 30% LIQUIDIAMOND® matrix (including DLC – Diamond-Like Carbon), manufactured in the USA.
Self-serrating edge due to the differential in hardness of the matrix and abrasives.
70 HRC abrasive and 50 HRC matrix for ultimate durability and ductility.
Blade Material:
2Cr14N heat treated to 49-50 HRC for optimal toughness, elasticity, and corrosion resistance.
Saltwater rated: 304 stainless pins and components work in harmony with LIQUIDIAMOND® edge and 2Cr14N blade.
Other knife makers talk endlessly about the minor differences between their knife and others. They show pictures and diagrams and go on and on. Yes, these features matter – and our team has paid close attention to them too, as you have seen.But these others don't have anything more important and different to talk about. We do!The sharpness and durability of our knife edge will become the Gold Standard for knives of this kind. Not many knives can do this:The Ultimatedge Knife can actually split hairs!Below are two charts showing four characteristics that are important when it comes to evaluating knife materials – edge durability, corrosion resistance, toughness and sharpness. See for yourself how the LIQUIDIAMOND® material compares to materials used in most other bushcraft and survival knives.We have held extensive discussions with the experts who reviewed our final knife prototype. Based on their input – AND on upgrade decisions we have made – here are some of the knife improvements you will experience when you pledge for your own Ultimatedge Knife:
Amorphous Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) has been added to the LIQUIDIAMOND® matrix alloy that comprises the knife edge. Multiple layers of micron scale coatings achieve both extreme durability and toughness.  
We are also coating the entire knife blade – edge, blade and tang – with DLC.
The Self-Sharpening, Serrated-Edge Geometry has been upgraded with our Provisional Patent filing. Layers of hard surface and soft substrate induce the self-sharpening effect, which increases the effective edge wear area from a few microns to 100+ microns.
We will reduce the handle weight and improve balance by adding cutouts to the tang.
We will increase the thickness and coke bottle-like curvature of the G-10 handle scales to improve fit and effectiveness.
Custom stainless steel pins – which are larger – will be ""curved"" to match the rounded scales.
The metal tang of the knife in the corner with the lanyard hole was relatively sharp and could cause a hand to blister with use. The solution is to move the lanyard hole in and away from the edges slightly and radius that back corner so it is fully rounded.
We firmly believe these changes will even further improve your enjoyment of this game-changing knife.Let's talk more about cost. We know price is driven by value. Yes, there are knives that cost more – and some that cost less.

The Germ Free Bee Airplane Seat Cover & Blanket



What is the Germ Free Bee and How does it work?

The Germ Free Bee is a Personal, Customized Airplane Seat
Cover that wraps around the seat’s headrest like a fitted bed sheet and drapes
over the seat with wings to serve as a blanket. The Germ Free Bee is made of
high-quality material and is 100 % washable. 
The Germ Free Bee not only shields travelers
from the previous passenger but it also serves as a Personalized Blanket/Wrap.

Have you ever wondered HOW MANY have sat there before YOU?!?
Airline tickets go up and baggage fees skyrocket but Airplane
Seats get smaller AND Definitely Not Cleaner.  Airlines
claim to clean the plane after each flight but study after study shows that airplanes and airplane seats are filthy and covered in germs. 
There is a lack of provided blankets on airplanes and there is NO
accountability on whether or not they reuse the blankets.  You pay Hundreds of Dollars for your flight so you deserve to be clean and comfortable! 









Why IndieGoGo Crowd Funding?
I am asking for YOUR help to raise enough funds for my first round of production (fabric purchasing, cutting, production, manufacturing, etc..). 
The Trademark is approved, the Patent Application is submitted, the Fabric is chosen, the Factory is located in the United States and the Prototype is made.  I have been working on this concept for the last 2 years and I am very excited to launch!  



Germ Free Bee Supports Our United States Service Members  
When you purhcase the BEEGrateful-Support OUR Troops package and EVERY package following, a United States Service Member will also receive a Germ Free Bee for their return home from service. Also, when the Germ Free Bee goes into full production, a portion of the proceeds will go to a Military Non-Profit Organization that helps with the travel needs of OUR Military and their Families.

Our starting point for all Arcido bags is the idea of streamlined, efficient travel. We want to travel hands-free, and we think wheelie bags are limiting. We’ve taken the feedback from the thousands of customers who have used our Faroe and Arcido bags to create two new products : Akra and Vaga. Akra is a lightweight travel backpack designed to give you easy access to all the stuff you need when you travel. Vaga is the daypack that accompanies it, which fits neatly inside. Our laptop protection system is second to none - suspend your laptop or macbook in a harness that hugs your device, and can be switched between the two bags. So whether you’re in travel or day mode, your laptop is protected.The main travel pack, Akra, is carry-on size and fits all the gear you'll need for a two week trip or longer. Our lightweight baby brother day pack, Vaga, is lightweight and can be slipped into the main pack and ready to use when you've arrived in town and want to explore. The adjustable laptop harness can easily transfer between bags.AKRA gives you easy access to the things you need when you travel. Take out your laptop or macbook at airport security by pulling the tab, keep your passport hidden and secure.

<p>EllieFunDay is committed to both making beautiful products and empowering marginalized women. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This is why we partner with a non-profit in India that works with victims of domestic abuse and human trafficking. They empower the women to break the cycles of poverty through a fair wage and dignified employment. Other companies use different models (one-for-one, percentage proceeds, etc.), but we believe that real poverty alleviation comes through sustainable job creation and paying a fair wage. This is central to why we started EllieFunDay and we are committed to empowering marginalized people around the world. </p>

</a></p></div>","When I was a kid, we’d play for days. Summer nights climbing trees, catching bees and prowling our imaginary wonderland. But there’s not so much of that these days… kids are staring more at screens than searching out for new adventures. 

This is why we created The Nomad Travel Blanket. We want to inspire our 
children to wander and wonder at all the world has to offer. It’s made with 100% washable organic cotton flannel and folds conveniently into an adorable pocket. It has a little loop for hooking onto a backpack, coat hook or stroller. And each blanket is named after an explorer: Amelia the Bunny, Marco the Panda, and Lewis the Raccoon.

You’ll love this new line… take a look.















EllieFunDay is committed to both making beautiful products and empowering marginalized women. 


This is why we partner with a non-profit in India that works with victims of domestic abuse and human trafficking. They empower the women to break the cycles of poverty through a fair wage and dignified employment. Other companies use different models (one-for-one, percentage proceeds, etc.), but we believe that real poverty alleviation comes through sustainable job creation and paying a fair wage. This is central to why we started EllieFunDay and we are committed to empowering marginalized people around the world. 







In 2012, EllieFunDay raised over $21K for our flagship blankets on Indiegogo. Our current products are sold in over 100 stores across the US and the world, including Barneys NYC, Nordstrom.com and ABC Carpet & Home. Our products have been seen in some of the top magazines like Martha Stewart Living and Earnshaws, with style curators like Eva Chen, former Lucky editor, and featured on blogs like Inhabitots, Babyccino and Mother Mag. Our reputation is built on delivering high quality organic cotton products that empower marginalized women through a fair-wage and dignified employment. 

 

How do I choose which animal I want to receive? 
At the end of the campaign, look out  for an email with a questionnaire for your choice of blanket. 
Do you ship internationally?
We ship world-wide! We include FREE SHIPPING for the continental United States.  For international locations, simply select your country at check-out and shipping costs will be calculated for you.


How long will it take to receive my order?
As fabric and product is made to order, production is planned for September and October for shipment late November. Once shipped, you will receive a confirmation email with tracking information.


What are the Nomad  Travel Blankets made of?
Each blanket is made with 100% GOTS certified organic cotton flannel that is sourced in India from an Oeko Tex Standard and ISO 9001:2008 Certified Company.


Are the Nomad  Travel Blankets machine washable?
Yes, the blankets can be machine washed on the gentle cycle. We recommend you lay the blanket flat to dry to retain its shape and details.


What is the appropriate age of the Nomad  Travel Blankets
The Nomad Travel Blankets are designed for children age 3 and up.


Can I return or exchange a Nomad  Travel Blankets?
We will only exchange a Travel Blanket that arrives damaged or was shipped in error.  


What is the size of the Nomad  Travel Blankets?
The Travel Blanket is 29”x40” and folds into a neat pocket of 12”x12”.


We've had an amazing community of talent, friends and family help us with this campaign! We couldn't have done it without them!

<p>Hello friends! We're working to save this historic church in Park Slope, Brooklyn, an architectural treasure and community centerpiece. The plaster ceiling is collapsing, and the sanctuary can't be used until we raise more than $700,000 to repair it. One of our congregation's core missions is to share our beautiful space with the larger community. Please help us to preserve it.</p>

<p><strong>Heart of Park Slope</strong></p>
<p>Old First Reformed Church lies at the very center of the cultural life of Park Slope. It's a house of prayer, a homeless shelter, a day-care facility, a meeting place for Alcoholics Anonymous, and a magnificent performance space for arts groups.  Currently we are hosting the Hurricane Sandy Relief Kitchen, which has provided 70,000 hot meals (and counting!) to storm victims.  Old First is both a neighborhood landmark and one of the city’s loveliest halls, with Tiffany glass windows, a Roosevelt pipe organ, a huge Tojetti oil painting, and a Neo-Gothic spire of Indiana limestone. Completed in 1891, Old First was the only church designed by architect George L. Morse, and boasts one of the country’s finest Arts and Crafts interiors. But though our congregation is Brooklyn's oldest—Peter Stuyvesant established it in 1654—it has only a hundred and fifty members. We can only save Old First with your help.</p>
<p><strong>Historic Landmark</strong></p>
<p>Brooklyn was once known as “The Borough of Churches,” but some of its most beautiful sanctuaries have already fallen. The Church of the Redeemer  at Fourth Street and Atlantic Avenue and “The Green Church” in Bay Ridge are being torn down because their upkeep has become too burdensome. <em>We can’t let that happen to Old First</em>. Our building is a keeper—and it's even listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As Brooklyn grows and new buildings rise all around us, churches like ours are becoming all the more valuable. They’re essential to our borough’s rich history, and few are more awe-inspiring than Old First.</p>
<p><strong>What Needs to Be Done</strong></p>
<p>Repairing our sanctuary is more than a matter of patching up some old plaster. The ornate plaster ceiling hangs from wooden supports above it, rather than being supported by bulky columns below (as in medieval cathedrals). Unfortunately, the metal fasteners that attach the ceiling to the superstructure have rusted and expanded over time, cracking the plaster. At the same time, the constant vibrations from truck and bus traffic over the past century and a quarter have caused chunks of plaster to fall. To fix the ceiling, workers will have to reattach the plaster panels to more than a half mile of wooden supports, a months-long process that will cost upwards of $700,000.</p>
<p><strong>How Donations Will Be Used</strong></p>
<p>All of the money raised on Indiegogo will go toward restoring the ceiling. Since the cost of even starting repairs is so high, this campaign will function as a community kick-off. We will also apply for funds from a number of grant sources and family foundations, but we first have to demonstrate that the community is behind this project. Your contribution will get us started, and help attract major funding in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What Else Are We Doing</strong></p>
<p>Old First has organized two groups to raise money for the repairs. One is a funding committee, and the other is <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/fourthmission.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>The Fourth Mission</strong></a>, an effort to provide community outreach, primarily through the arts. On September 23, at the Bell House, the Fourth Mission held its inaugural event: a benefit concert called The Brooklyn Bluegrass Bash featuring many of New York’s world-class bluegrass musicians and emceed by actor Peter Sarsgaard, this sold-out event raised over $25,000 for ceiling repair. More Fourth Mission events are planned for the coming months, including a Messiah sing-along and the Jingle Bell Jamboree.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>As a church, our mission has always been to help others, and we're not as good at asking for help. But we need it. One of the greatest gifts we can give our neighbors is the use of our sanctuary. Your donation, in any amount, will help insure that Old First can continue to welcome Park Slope’s musicians and artists, speakers and community groups. Help us connect with people around the world who love Brooklyn, New York history, historical preservation, Tiffany glass, community outreach, and spiritual community. By joining with us, they can help us save one of this city’s great spaces.</p>

<b>Waldeinsamkeit:
my journey</b></p><b></b>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I
had “lost”, I had forgotten these photos for 25 years - later on
I’ll explain why. When I found them again, a year ago, I was
surprised with how old they looked, much older than their 25 years.
Europe is changing today in a lightning fast pace and that’s why
what I saw then, looks now like “another” Europe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When
I started all this in 1985, we had then a divided Europe, the Wall,
two opposite camps, the Cold War, all that stuff. By that time I was
a young person fascinated by <i>Mitteleuropa,</i>
by its music, literature, history, everything. The division of
Central Europe in particular –and consequently of whole Europe–,
as well as the oppression in the East, overwhelmed me. And then I had
this “idea” of traveling all over Europe, visiting European
countries, Eastern and Western alike, photographing people living on
both sides of the Wall, and presenting all these humans together in a
book, beyond borders and barriers. A naïve and grandiose “plan”,
like all youthful plans.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And
that gave me the energy, the motivation to travel for the next five
years all around Europe, from Lisbon to Warsaw, visiting 17
countries, always alone, with a small clunker running at 90km/h max,
sleeping in it, spending the nights in highway parking lots or in the
middle of nowhere, stopping in every city, walking for hours
observing people in the streets, a big joy. And taking a few photos
of them. And every winter I would return home to develop the films
and work, waiting until springtime to take off again.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453117347/tltzc87twafkbtsfujj3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Paris, France, 1989</i><div>

In the  last few years before the fall of the Berlin Wall (1985-89). 200 pages, 95 photos from Eastern and Western Europe (16 countries), finely printed on 170 gr high quality paper. Duotone printing, soft cover. The book is already printed  (Dec. 2015), it's beautiful, and ready to ship. This is the first (self) edition. My aim is to sell books (in an affordable price) in order to be able to continue curating and scanning photos from my large archive (forgotten for 25 years), where all this came from. This is a totally independently made project and edition, my only financing is your purchase of the book. Below is the preface of the book with some explanations.Prague, Czechoslovakia, 1986
Waldeinsamkeit:
my journey


I
had “lost”, I had forgotten these photos for 25 years - later on
I’ll explain why. When I found them again, a year ago, I was
surprised with how old they looked, much older than their 25 years.
Europe is changing today in a lightning fast pace and that’s why
what I saw then, looks now like “another” Europe.

When
I started all this in 1985, we had then a divided Europe, the Wall,
two opposite camps, the Cold War, all that stuff. By that time I was
a young person fascinated by Mitteleuropa,
by its music, literature, history, everything. The division of
Central Europe in particular –and consequently of whole Europe–,
as well as the oppression in the East, overwhelmed me. And then I had
this “idea” of traveling all over Europe, visiting European
countries, Eastern and Western alike, photographing people living on
both sides of the Wall, and presenting all these humans together in a
book, beyond borders and barriers. A naïve and grandiose “plan”,
like all youthful plans.

And
that gave me the energy, the motivation to travel for the next five
years all around Europe, from Lisbon to Warsaw, visiting 17
countries, always alone, with a small clunker running at 90km/h max,
sleeping in it, spending the nights in highway parking lots or in the
middle of nowhere, stopping in every city, walking for hours
observing people in the streets, a big joy. And taking a few photos
of them. And every winter I would return home to develop the films
and work, waiting until springtime to take off again.Paris, France, 1989


I
visited Eastern Europe and I saw the misery in Romania, the
oppression and fear in the eyes of people in East Germany and
Czechoslovakia. And a somewhat milder life in Hungary and Poland. And
at the same time I was visiting the West, and took pictures of
western people in the exact same way as I did in the East. Western
Europe wasn’t paradise for me, I was there to see the lonely, the
elderly or the poor, most of the time. I soon realized that I wasn’t
into “photojournalism”; I was unable to document reality. The
only subjects I was really interested in were the human faces I could
see in the streets, and the human condition, maybe.

And
then, in 1989, the Wall collapsed, suddenly, without asking me
whether I had completed the project or not... And my grandiose plan,
a
Europe with no walls,
unified through photography, seemed more stupid than ever... So, I
wondered what the heck I was doing all those years, what the point of
all this was. The decompression was so abrupt. But I was in Berlin
that cold November night and I lived the most exciting moments of  my
life, everybody there felt that way, we were living History, Freedom.
Europe was changing before our eyes, walls were falling, it was
magic.

<p><br/>If ""simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,"" the Taskin Kompak Packing System delivers them both in spades. After launching two wildly successful Kickstarter travel products, we decided it's time to go all-in, with a complete set of packing accessories that radically redefines the word ""essential"" for today's savvy traveler. </p>
<p>Our two previous campaigns were well received, below are some of the comments:</p>
<div data-id=""20195693""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/020/195/693/d300fae8d221c61e41ad176d6571b678_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1518318288&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=835f4fea2101897714ece0de42993313"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>It is time to do it all over again. After relentless prototyping and rigorous testing, we're proud to introduce four ingenious new products that'll have you packing like a boss in no time. We promise you've never seen anything like this before.</p>

<h3>#1 Kruze Toiletry Kit: A Bright Idea in Traveling Light</h3>
<div data-id=""20182785""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1520006365/zoolax0gdzdffbzdybns.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Grooming kit. Dopp bag. Toiletry case. In a sea of sameness, there has been so little innovation—until now. The new Taskin Kruze isn't just the most advanced toiletry kit ever. It's lightyears ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>How's this for a first: The Kruze comes with a built-in, germicidal UV-C lamp. Simply press the button and 3 seconds later, the UV-C lights up to kill 99.9% of the germs in your bag—and shuts itself off after 3 mins.  </p>
<div data-id=""20195018""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1520006366/x17yycmgkgzsiwo4q32i.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Aluminum-coated lining helps keep the inside dry and clean, and reflects the UV-C light around the interior to help zap those germs—so you get a lot less gross on the go.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Plus: The Kruze comes with 4 extra-strong suction cups so you can attach it to smooth, flat surfaces like the bathroom mirror. Now, your stuff is always within reach.</p>
<div data-id=""20195020""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1520006367/jzbzk9izv9hs6msezrz0.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>And talk about smart: The Kruze's exterior is made of tough, waterproof tarpaulin. If one of the containers inside spills, the rest of your luggage stays clean and dry. No muss, and so much less fuss. </p>
<div data-id=""20048648""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1520006368/lrt1u8k25uzkmscel1pk.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Thoughtfully-designed organizational features will fire up even the most demanding travelers.</p>

<p>Plus: It folds down tight into an easy-pack disk that packs neatly into a pocket on one end of its carry bag.  </p>
<div data-id=""20195028""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1520006374/l7l7udmn0r5l7mal5jgv.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Best of all: The stow pocket into which the Disq is folded/compressed into also doubles as one of two external pockets when the Disq is in use.  </p>
<p>Plus, the straps in front easily attach to the handle of carry-on luggage for the ultimate in convenience.</p>

</div></div>","If ""simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,"" the Taskin Kompak Packing System delivers them both in spades. After launching two wildly successful Kickstarter travel products, we decided it's time to go all-in, with a complete set of packing accessories that radically redefines the word ""essential"" for today's savvy traveler. 
Our two previous campaigns were well received, below are some of the comments:

It is time to do it all over again. After relentless prototyping and rigorous testing, we're proud to introduce four ingenious new products that'll have you packing like a boss in no time. We promise you've never seen anything like this before.

 

#1 Kruze Toiletry Kit: A Bright Idea in Traveling Light

Grooming kit. Dopp bag. Toiletry case. In a sea of sameness, there has been so little innovation—until now. The new Taskin Kruze isn't just the most advanced toiletry kit ever. It's lightyears ahead of the competition.
How's this for a first: The Kruze comes with a built-in, germicidal UV-C lamp. Simply press the button and 3 seconds later, the UV-C lights up to kill 99.9% of the germs in your bag—and shuts itself off after 3 mins.  

Aluminum-coated lining helps keep the inside dry and clean, and reflects the UV-C light around the interior to help zap those germs—so you get a lot less gross on the go.


Plus: The Kruze comes with 4 extra-strong suction cups so you can attach it to smooth, flat surfaces like the bathroom mirror. Now, your stuff is always within reach.

And talk about smart: The Kruze's exterior is made of tough, waterproof tarpaulin. If one of the containers inside spills, the rest of your luggage stays clean and dry. No muss, and so much less fuss. 

Thoughtfully-designed organizational features will fire up even the most demanding travelers.

 

With so much innovation, the Taskin Kruze sets the new standard for premium toiletry kits everywhere. 
#2: Disq Travel Duffel: For Tuck-in-Go Situations
Need to pack an extra bag for that trip to Milan or Milwaukee, just in case? It's a cinch with the Taskin Disq Duffel.

This smart, stylish duffel is made of super-tough, honeycomb nylon so it's ready for anything.

Disq is constructed using high quality honeycomb rip-stop nylon and waterproof zippers.

Plus: It folds down tight into an easy-pack disk that packs neatly into a pocket on one end of its carry bag.  

Best of all: The stow pocket into which the Disq is folded/compressed into also doubles as one of two external pockets when the Disq is in use.  
Plus, the straps in front easily attach to the handle of carry-on luggage for the ultimate in convenience.

 

 
#3 Taskin Gadget Stash: Jumble-Free Jetting is Here
Road warriors rejoice: Now there's an upscale electronics bag that helps you keep all those dongles, drives, cables and connectors under control.
 

 

Our innovative cable clip can be used to set the length of cables and wires, so you can avoid a bad case of the tangles.

After use, you can easily secure the clip onto a corresponding magnetic cradle to keep everything in its place.



 

No more cramming. No more chaos. Just gear up and go.
#4 QiK Shoe Bag: Two-in-One Convenience, Just for Kicks
Maybe it's your trusty wingtips, your favorite Chelsea's, or even those crazy trainers you got in Hong Kong. When it comes to your go-to shoes, the Taskin QiK stashes them away in the most efficient way possible.

The QiK comes with odor-resistant materials because dude, let's not even go there.

And check this out: The bag can be separated into two halves, and each can fit up to a pair of adult shoes. Now, you can pack a pair of shoes together, or spread them around where they fit best. Your shoes will thank you—and so will everyone else.

#5 Duplex Packing Cubes : Add Our Dual-Sided Packing Cubes & Fit 40% More In The Same Space 

 
 
Miss out on our big campaign for the Kompak packing cube? Here's your chance to fix that or if you need more, can't have enough packing cubes!

On one side: An air-breathable compartment to keep clothes packed tight and wrinkle-free. On the other: An odor and water resistant pouch with waterproof zippers and lining, so you can keep your damp and dirties away from your dry and cleans. 

   With dual-side compression, you can pack 40% more in the same amount of space. Which means you get double thee awesome in one ultra-compression cube.

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>We're Paul Kletter and Mary Beth Karabinos, married business partners who've traveled the world together and helped run hostels in multiple countries in addition to starting two successful, small businesses here in Pittsburgh.  We've had amazing hostel experiences both abroad and stateside and wanted to share our hometown in a similar setting.</p>
<p>Early in 2018, we wrapped up construction and received all necessary permits for the South Side Traveler's Rest (SSTR for short), a 35-guest hostel conveniently located in Pittsburgh's iconic South Side neighborhood.  Our 1883 building, once the executive headquarters of the A.M. Byers Pipe Company, is a one-a-kind gem flush with original woodwork and 19th Century details.  We've performed a full renovation on the building, upgrading all major utilities and creating great new living spaces imbued with historic character.</p>
<p>Nestled in Pittsburgh's Historic South Side neighborhood, an industrial-residential enclave walking distance to Pittsburgh's Downtown, the SSTR is also within a mile of the terminus the Great Allegheny Passage, the rail-trail system linking the Steel City with Washington, D.C.   We aim to be a haven for bicyclists finishing and beginning their GAP journeys as well as a destination for domestic and foreign travelers of all budgets. </p>
<h3><strong>Why now?</strong></h3>
<p>We've turned to crowdfunding for our last push because the 3+ year build-out has stretched our opening-day budget thinner than expected.  There's little-to-no risk to you, and the amount we are looking to raise ($20,000) is less than 10% of what we've invested to date.   Whereas the lengthy permitting process was fraught with obstacles and question marks, now that we're over those hurdles, the only thing between us and hosting you are items like linens, a security system, bike racks and furniture for the common areas. Some of these items may sound small, but they add up! And providing them means you will be comfortable, and that's our main goal.  <i> </i></p>
<p>In exchange for your support, we can offer one-of-kind accommodations, unforgettable experiences, and even the honor of a room or bunk in our iconic building named for you.  Plus, some really old nails Paul made us save.  They have a square head or some B.S.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In a city rapidly filling up with corporate hotels, development companies and outsider's capital, you'll be helping a pair of born-and-bred Pittsburghers offer amazing experiences to fellow travelers.   You'll be part of the movement towards comfortable and safe accommodations in more communal settings.  You'll be helping cyclists complete their journey in style. You will be helping to repurpose an authentic building, thereby preserving part of this city's great industrial history. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>And most importantly: You'll be giving people another reason to love Pittsburgh.  </span></p>

<div style=""clear:both;""> </div>
<div style=""clear:both;""><strong>Why have you pre-produced some products?</strong></div>
<div style=""clear:both;"">Unlike most campaigns, we've done a small pre-production. This is to ensure that the quality of our bags is up to the level Indiegogo backers expect, and that we can deliver our products on-time.</div>
<div style=""clear:both;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514452295/xscg8gnw33pwdu07vtm5.jpg"" src=""""/></div>
</div><div>
<div><b>Where do you ship from?</b></div>
<div style=""clear:both;"">All of our goods are manufactured in China and will be shipped directly from Hong Kong.</div>
<div style=""clear:both;""> </div>
<div style=""clear:both;"">
<div><b>Do you charge for shipping?</b></div>
<div style=""clear:both;"">We charge a small amount for shipping. The cost varies from country-to-country. You can see the price during the checkout process.</div>
</div>
<div style=""clear:both;""> </div>
</div><div><strong>Will I be charged Tax in the EU?</strong></div><div style=""clear:both;"">Customers in certain countries in the EU (<strong>France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Italy and Spain) </strong>will NOT have to pay tax on arrival. We will pre-pay all customs taxes, duties and admin fees meaning no sudden surprises during delivery! Customers in other EU countries may have to pay tax but we will do our best to minimize these. Please note that other than the countries listed above, we are not able to pay these taxes on your behalf.</div><div style=""clear:both;""> </div><div style=""clear:both;"">
<div><strong>Will I be charged Tax elsewhere?</strong></div>
<div style=""clear:both;"">
<p>Taxes vary from country to country and due to the global nature of Indiegogo, it's impossible for us to make arrangements for every single country. However, we have done our best to minimize any taxes and import fees for you by either shipping from local hubs or pre-paying the taxes on individual shipments. Backers in <strong>France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Italy and Spain</strong> do not have to worry about additional taxes and fees, as we have paid these in advance.</p>
<p>Backers in the following countries should also not have to pay any additional fees: the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan. Based on our experience, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines should generally be fine but larger pledges (e.g. the multi-pack) may incur additional import fees. Backers in other EU countries may have to pay VAT or other import duties. Backers in Mexico, Brazil, India and Russia should be aware that the import process can be quite tricky and you may need to provide us with your tax information prior to shipping. </p>
</div>
</div><div style=""clear:both;""><strong>How long will shipping take?</strong></div><div style=""clear:both;"">
<div style=""clear:both;"">Shipping will take between 3-7 days for most countries. We'll update all backers several days before our shipping commences and will notify you as soon as your product is on its way. </div>
<div style=""clear:both;""> </div>
<div style=""clear:both;"">
<div><b>Will my products be trackable?</b></div>
<div style=""clear:both;"">Yes! All orders will be fully trackable. We'll send tracking numbers out to you via email 2-3 days after your order has been shipped.</div>

<div><strong>Can I get a refund if I don't like my product?</strong></div>
<div style=""clear:both;"">Unlike most Indiegogo campaigns, our backers are able to claim a refund if they change their minds. Please be aware that the Indiegogo fees are not refundable and the return shipping fee will be borne by the backer.</div>
<div style=""clear:both;""> </div>
<div style=""clear:both;""><strong>Is there a warranty on the bags?</strong></div>

<h2>PRODUCT FAQs</h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>GENERAL PRODUCT QUERIES</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Is the material cutproof?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Code 10 Backpack is not made of a specialist cutproof material. It's extremely durable and would put up a good fight against a thief with a knife, but it is not impenetrable to someone with good tools. What we aimed for was a bag that would prevent against petty thieves, pickpockets and bag snatchers. We actually experimented a lot with slash proof materials and in the end we decided not to use it for the Code 10. There were a number of reasons for this, but the main one was that we did not find a material that was both truly waterproof AND truly slashproof.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Are the bags fully waterproof?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Our bags are highly water resistant. This means that they'll keep out 99% of moisture in heavy rain conditions. We'd go as far as to say that they're waterproof, but the reason we don't actually call the bags waterproof is that if they're not closed properly, you may find water creeping in. We therefore advise you to avoid submerging the bags in water if possible. </p>

When do I get my product?
We've pre-produced all of the Early Birds products, so if you're lucky enough to be one of our Early Bird backers, we'll ship to you immediately after the campaign ends. For all other backers, you'll receive your products approximately 70 days after the end of the campaign.
 
Why have you pre-produced some products?
Unlike most campaigns, we've done a small pre-production. This is to ensure that the quality of our bags is up to the level Indiegogo backers expect, and that we can deliver our products on-time.


Where do you ship from?
All of our goods are manufactured in China and will be shipped directly from Hong Kong.
 

Do you charge for shipping?
We charge a small amount for shipping. The cost varies from country-to-country. You can see the price during the checkout process.

 
Will I be charged Tax in the EU?Customers in certain countries in the EU (France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Italy and Spain) will NOT have to pay tax on arrival. We will pre-pay all customs taxes, duties and admin fees meaning no sudden surprises during delivery! Customers in other EU countries may have to pay tax but we will do our best to minimize these. Please note that other than the countries listed above, we are not able to pay these taxes on your behalf. 
Will I be charged Tax elsewhere?

Taxes vary from country to country and due to the global nature of Indiegogo, it's impossible for us to make arrangements for every single country. However, we have done our best to minimize any taxes and import fees for you by either shipping from local hubs or pre-paying the taxes on individual shipments. Backers in France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Italy and Spain do not have to worry about additional taxes and fees, as we have paid these in advance.
Backers in the following countries should also not have to pay any additional fees: the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan. Based on our experience, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines should generally be fine but larger pledges (e.g. the multi-pack) may incur additional import fees. Backers in other EU countries may have to pay VAT or other import duties. Backers in Mexico, Brazil, India and Russia should be aware that the import process can be quite tricky and you may need to provide us with your tax information prior to shipping. 

How long will shipping take?
Shipping will take between 3-7 days for most countries. We'll update all backers several days before our shipping commences and will notify you as soon as your product is on its way. 
 

Will my products be trackable?
Yes! All orders will be fully trackable. We'll send tracking numbers out to you via email 2-3 days after your order has been shipped.


Can I get a refund if I don't like my product?
Unlike most Indiegogo campaigns, our backers are able to claim a refund if they change their minds. Please be aware that the Indiegogo fees are not refundable and the return shipping fee will be borne by the backer.
 
Is there a warranty on the bags?

Yes! All products come with a one year warranty. The warranties cover all manufacturing defects. More information can be found on our website. 
 

How do I contact your support team?
We have customer support in:
 - English - support@code10bags.com

 - Japanese (日语) - support@code10bags.jp

  Timesulin was designed to take away the anxiety of not knowing for sure if
  you have taken your insulin injection - a problem facing 77% of
  insulin users up to six times per month. Timesulin helps you to avoid missed
  or double injections - and the anxiety of being unsure.</p>

<b>We believe</b> that everyone around the world should have the same
  opportunity to control their diabetes and choose the tools they use to do so.
  That is why we launched Timesulin to European consumers back in 2012. A

  mind:</p>

<strong>Dealing with diabetes</strong> everyday is complicated enough. Our
  goal was to address the most important question of controlling your diabetes
  - ‘Did I take my shot or not?’ as simply as possible. No buttons to push,
  nothing to program, no change to your existing regime. Simply click Timesulin
  onto your existing insulin pen and you are ready to go! Timesulin does one
  thing and it does that really well. And really simply.</p>

<strong>How long does Timesulin last?</strong> Each Timesulin cap comes
  with a built-in battery, which is non-replaceable. Your Timesulin unit's
  battery will last for at least 12 months - sometimes longer, depending upon
  use, temperature etc. Once the battery starts running low on power, your
  screen will start fading, giving you a visual indication that it's time to
  replace your cap.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue Light', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">
<strong>Can the battery be replaced?</strong> No. After a year of use your Timesulin unit will be quite dirty and worn - not so strange when you consider that it followed you around everyday for a
  year! The Timesulin product can be easily
  recycled when it has reached the end of its lifespan.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue Light', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">
<strong>Is Timesulin an alarm?</strong> No. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The wonderful thing about insulin pens is that they allow us flexibility to decide for ourselves when we want to eat, when to bolus, when it is convenient to inject.  We believe most of us living with diabetes want to balance our diabetes into our normal lives, not live according to a super strict routine with alarms that ring 4-6 times per day.</span></p><p style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue Light', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">
  If you've ever had to figure out how to program a device with tiny
  buttons and difficult instruction manuals we think you'll appreciate
  Timesulin's simple approach to making life easier for all with
  diabetes. No buttons to push, nothing to program, no new systems to learn.<br/></p>

<strong>Why doesn’t your product have wifi/bluetooth/NFC etc?</strong> While
  we absolutely think there is a lot of value in connected products - and
  especially the data that comes from managing our diabetes - we wanted
  simplicity above all else. Our team has a background making technical
  hardware and software products. Bluetooth often leads to connection problems, wifi doesn’t always work
  and uses a lot of battery power, USB connections...don’t we all have enough
  cables at home already? Additionally, the software that you need to manage
  all these things is often not very user friendly.<br/>
<br/>
  The value of this data is unquestionable, however we believe it comes at the
  cost of products that are easy to use. We believe simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue Light', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">
<strong>Is it one size fits all?</strong> No. Timesulin is custom-made to fit
  with the most widely used disposable insulin pens in the world, covering
  twelve different insulin types, listed above. </p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue Light', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">
<strong>Can I check how much insulin I have before I leave home without
  Timesulin resetting?</strong> Yes<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, we thought of that. There is an 8-second delay built into the cap so that you have time to check how much insulin is
  left in the pen before you head out.</span></p><p style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue Light', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p>

      hour window you’re supposed to. Additionally, it starts counting up from
      00:00, first in seconds then in minutes, immediately after you replace

  Timesulin, the world's first and only smart cap that snaps onto existing
  insulin pens.


    Designed by people living with diabetes.

    Already used by tens of thousands of people in over 40
    countries.

    Funds to this Indiegogo campaign will be used to prepare and submit our FDA
    application and launch into the U.S.A.


  Timesulin was designed to take away the anxiety of not knowing for sure if
  you have taken your insulin injection - a problem facing 77% of
  insulin users up to six times per month. Timesulin helps you to avoid missed
  or double injections - and the anxiety of being unsure.






We believe that everyone around the world should have the same
  opportunity to control their diabetes and choose the tools they use to do so.
  That is why we launched Timesulin to European consumers back in 2012. A
  simple device that tackles a complex problem with the following principles in
  mind:

  Simplicity - Above all else

Dealing with diabetes everyday is complicated enough. Our
  goal was to address the most important question of controlling your diabetes
  - ‘Did I take my shot or not?’ as simply as possible. No buttons to push,
  nothing to program, no change to your existing regime. Simply click Timesulin
  onto your existing insulin pen and you are ready to go! Timesulin does one
  thing and it does that really well. And really simply.

  Empowerment - You decide

We saw a problem in how we managed
  our own diabetes, aimed to solve it and developed Timesulin. As users of
  Timesulin ourselves, we want you to be able to decide for yourself if
  Timesulin is right for you.  By pledging your support to this campaign you are putting
  yourself in the driver’s seat by providing us with the funds, proving demand
  and ultimately getting Timesulin launched into the U.S.A.

  Experience - We live with diabetes

Our CEO and co-founder John has
  lived with Type 1 diabetes for 28 years. John's brother and co-founder
  Andreas was one of the original creators of Skype and has built his career on
  making products that are super easy to use. Together with a third partner from MIT our team set out to solve
  a real life problem. We know the challenges of carb counting. We also
  fear night time hypos. We know that sometimes diabetes just does not make
  sense. By looking at actual people, actually using insulin pens, we designed
  Timesulin to make life with diabetes a little bit easier.



  THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE
A study conducted on over 3,000
  patients by the pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk highlights that more than
  one in three patients skip insulin doses, or fail to take their insulin as
  prescribed, stating that they have done so on average three times in the last
  month. 77% of physicians estimate that in reality this number may be as high
  as six doses according to the GAPP
  report.

It's easy to forget whether or not
  you have turned off the coffee machine, or unplugged the curling iron. The
  difference with forgetting whether or not you had taken your insulin shot is
  that it can have very severe consequences - an accidental double dose can
  lead to a coma. Or even death.

25,000 car accidents in America resulted from severe hypoglycaemia in 2011.

$17,564 is the average cost of a hospital visit caused by
    severe hypoglycaemia.

""You and your team have a winner. It
    is needed, simple in concept, easy to use, inexpensive, promotes safety,
    decreases concerns of patients, loved ones and healthcare providers,
    increases the balance of diabetes for many (most, even the brightest,
    forget sometimes), and again it is NEEDED!""

  TIMESULIN WORKS WITH YOUR PEN


Timesulin has been made to fit all major disposable pens, without additional bulk, turning your insulin pen into a smart pen.


  WHY CROWDFUNDING


As a small but growing company the task of bringing a medical device
  to the market is a huge undertaking. This can cost millions of dollars. 

  We have found that the barriers to launching our product into the United
  States have been too big for us and we can’t put our company’s survival at
  risk, without knowing that we have the support of the most important people
  we know - fellow people with diabetes. Indiegogo allows us to test and ensure that people in
  the U.S.A. need our product and are willing to join us on this mission to make
  life with diabetes easier. 

  We have done all the groundwork to prepare for submitting our application to
  the FDA and this campaign will raise the money needed to complete the process.

We are very proud of what we have achieved and have stayed true to
  our mission of simplicity. With your help we can all benefit!

PRESS COVERAGE


  “The design challenge was to make the cap as simple as possible: no
  instruction manual, no buttons, and no need for users to change their
  routine.” FINANCIAL TIMES

  “This is all to say, 1) sometimes bad things happen to good people 2) don't
  beat yourself up, just remedy the situation and try to do a little better
  next time 3) technology is producing some great new diabetes devices…” HUFFINGTON POST

  “... a genuinely interesting product” DIABETES DAILY

  “As we all know, there’s A LOT to remember when it comes to diabetes. So Timesulin...help patients remember whether or not they’ve taken their insulin injection.” DIABETES MINE

  “If anything, I would say that Timesulin made me aware of how often I truly forget whether or not I have given an injection.” SIX UNTIL ME

OTHER
    QUESTIONS


  ///PRODUCT QUESTIONS

How long does Timesulin last? Each Timesulin cap comes
  with a built-in battery, which is non-replaceable. Your Timesulin unit's
  battery will last for at least 12 months - sometimes longer, depending upon
  use, temperature etc. Once the battery starts running low on power, your
  screen will start fading, giving you a visual indication that it's time to
  replace your cap.

Can the battery be replaced? No. After a year of use your Timesulin unit will be quite dirty and worn - not so strange when you consider that it followed you around everyday for a
  year! The Timesulin product can be easily
  recycled when it has reached the end of its lifespan.

Is Timesulin an alarm? No. The wonderful thing about insulin pens is that they allow us flexibility to decide for ourselves when we want to eat, when to bolus, when it is convenient to inject.  We believe most of us living with diabetes want to balance our diabetes into our normal lives, not live according to a super strict routine with alarms that ring 4-6 times per day.
  If you've ever had to figure out how to program a device with tiny
  buttons and difficult instruction manuals we think you'll appreciate
  Timesulin's simple approach to making life easier for all with
  diabetes. No buttons to push, nothing to program, no new systems to learn.

Why doesn’t your product have wifi/bluetooth/NFC etc? While
  we absolutely think there is a lot of value in connected products - and
  especially the data that comes from managing our diabetes - we wanted
  simplicity above all else. Our team has a background making technical
  hardware and software products. Bluetooth often leads to connection problems, wifi doesn’t always work
  and uses a lot of battery power, USB connections...don’t we all have enough
  cables at home already? Additionally, the software that you need to manage
  all these things is often not very user friendly.

  The value of this data is unquestionable, however we believe it comes at the
  cost of products that are easy to use. We believe simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

Is it one size fits all? No. Timesulin is custom-made to fit
  with the most widely used disposable insulin pens in the world, covering
  twelve different insulin types, listed above. 

Can I check how much insulin I have before I leave home without
  Timesulin resetting? Yes, we thought of that. There is an 8-second delay built into the cap so that you have time to check how much insulin is
  left in the pen before you head out.

  ///BUYING AND SHIPPING

What are the shipping costs? All shipping in the United States is free
  of charge. There is an additional cost of $15 for international shipping, which you have to add to your total backing amount. Please note that shipment does not include extra fees from customs, or additional costs
  associated with your country if you live outside the United States. Also, it
  is important to know that we can only ship to countries that our product is
  registered in and/or that honors the CE mark (our registration in Europe) or
  the FDA registration. If it turns out that shipment to your country proves
  impossible, we will reimburse your order.

I do not live in the US, can I still back this
  campaign? Absolutely! You have
  two options:


You can back this campaign if you want
  to support this new and innovative method to crowdsource products. We would
  love to have you join us.


If you live in one of the countries
    our product is already sold, you can visit our website and either order
    directly OR we can put you in contact with our partners who can provide it
    to you. Send us an email and we will help you out.




When can I expect to receive my product? Our estimated shipping date for the device to the
    United States is between July - October 2014, depending upon how quickly we
    get approval from the FDA. As soon as we see that our campaign will be
    successfully funded, we will start the application process with the FDA. We
    will need approximately 3 weeks to modify our existing European regulatory
    file so that it suits the FDA in the best way and will work with FDA
    application experts to do so.


We will submit our application a
    maximum of 3 weeks after the campaign closes (we have one member of our
    team focusing on this as top priority)

According to our communications
      with the FDA the average clearance time is around 150 calendar days.
      Speaking with other medical device companies, it may be possible to
      shorten this to 90 days.
As soon as we have the regulatory
      approval, we are ready. We will be able to build stock ahead of this time
      and send it as early as the day after we get approval.


///WHO CAN USE TIMESULIN?

Does it work for people with both Type 1
      and Type 2? Timesulin
      eases anxiety for people living with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes using insulin
      pens to administer their slow or fast acting insulin. The nature of the
      product allows anyone who administers insulin injections with pens to
      benefit from the use of Timesulin.

      In addition to people with diabetes, we have identified the following
      groups who use our product:


Parents of a child with diabetes who worry that their child may
          have missed a dose


Parents of a child with diabetes, where the child is too young to
          communicate that a shot has already been administered by the other
          parent


Parents to a teenager who worries about their child maintaining
          control over their diabetes


People with diabetes who travel
          across timezones and want to keep track of their insulin dosage
          times



      If you visit our website you can see testimonials from
      our users around the world.


Does it work for long acting (Basal) and
      short acting (Bolus) insulin? Yes. Timesulin counts up to 99:59 (99 hours and 59
      minutes) so it is perfect to ensure you take your basal within the 24
      hour window you’re supposed to. Additionally, it starts counting up from
      00:00, first in seconds then in minutes, immediately after you replace
      the Timesulin cap onto your pen, so whether it’s been five minutes or
      five hours since your last shot, you will always know.

     ///WHY CROWDSOURCING?
How
      will you use the funds. We
      are not expecting to make a profit on any of the money raised in this
      campaign. The bulk of this campaign funding will be spent on the actual
      FDA application fee and getting professional legal/regulatory support
       to help us prepare the application (estimated cost, $28,000, excluding fees). If we
      were to exceed our campaign goal, all additional funds will be used to
      help make Timesulin more widely available in the United States.
///OTHER QUESTIONS

What risks are there to this
      campaign? We have already
      completed the development of the product, we have been producing it for
      over two years and it is being used by people with diabetes all over the
      world. The product is done.Our only risk is that the FDA does not approve our application, or more
      likely, that we need to compliment it in some way. We believe the risk that
      they wouldn’t approve it is very low. We have already been in discussions
      with the FDA and they have been very helpful thus far.

Does your product already exist? Yes. Timesulin has been sold in Europe since February 2012. Since then we have secured distributors in over 40
      countries around the world, including Japan, Canada, Germany and the
      United Arab Emirates. We have sold thousands of products and you can find
      many client testimonials on our website.
Do any
      patient organisations work with you? Yes, we work closely with Europe’s
      largest diabetes patient organization called Diabetes UK. In fact, our
      product is one of their best-sellers. We work with a number of diabetes
      patient organizations around the world, both to provide our product and, importantly, to advance diabetes advocacy. Beyond our work with Timesulin,
      we volunteer towards a number of patient advocacy groups including the
      International Diabetes Federation, Life for a Child and the Diabetes
      Hands Foundation.

 Who Are We? We’re a team of friends who’ve collectively traveled to over 125 countries.  From the top of Mt. Everest to the jungles of Bolivia to military bases in Iraq, we’ve spent time in some of the most dangerous and extreme environments in the world.Through it all, we’ve found ourselves in more than a few difficult situations and it's these experiences that have taught us the importance of having the right tools and the proper knowledge. And because of this, we live prepared every day.  The Problem.While day to day life is extremely comfortable for most, life can change in an instant, and in the world we live in, being prepared is not an option any more.  It’s a necessity.“Go Bags” or “Bug Out Bags” and survival bags are not a new concept, but most of what is available in the marketplace is poorly executed, not purposely designed, and outdated.  Cheap materials, unnecessary or missed components, combined with poor or no instruction make these bags a dangerous waste of money.  
Introducing The SEVENTY2:   The Seventy2 not only provides all the tools and supplies you need, but clear instructions guide even the inexperienced user.  It can turn deadly situations to inconvenient moments, and creates heroes from victims.  It provides you all the tools you need to stay warm, safe, connected and protected.We Designed The Seventy2 From The Ground Up.The Seventy2’s outer shell is made of lightweight, waterproof and extremely durable tarpaulin. This material is so air-tight, the bag can be used as a floatation device.  Gray in color, you will blend into a crowd in an emergency situation, and avoid marking you as an inadvertent target.  Both shoulders feature flashlight mounts for hands free lighting, and our logo is highly reflective, providing additional safety at night. The adjustable sternum strap features an integrated emergency whistle. A durable and lightweight Nalgene water bottle comes printed with custom instructions and measurements on best practices to stay hydrated in an emergency situation. It's What's Inside That Counts.Open the air-tight roll-top and inside you will find a military-grade canvas insert with a hard exoskeleton and over 30 high quality tools. Pull the insert out.  It can be carried separately, featuring backpack straps so that you can use the external bag for additional carrying capacity where needed. Opening the insert reveals over 30 tools that have been hand selected by our team of experts based on it’s necessity, quality, and ease of use. Our components have been modernized for today’s technological realities.  Components are categorized by need, allowing quick access when seconds count, and clear and simple instructions help even an inexperienced person take command of almost any situation.The Seventy2 is a modern fully integrated survival system.

We live in Greece, a country that carries a big part of the world for over a millennium. Words and ideas like philosophy, art, architecture, medicine, mathematics, music, and drama were heard of for the first time in this land and evolved to the sciences we know of today. Our vision is to offer every visitor of our country the opportunity to learn in details the history behind the most important archaeological sites by using an intelligent narration system. To learn about the museums and the rich collections and all the statues we run into on virtually every street. This has led us to create KUDOS.

KUDOS is the first interactive guide system. How many of you have ever wandered aimlessly during a visit abroad without understanding the history and culture of the country you are visiting? KUDOS, an exceptionally innovative application, takes the honor and responsibility of being your guide and tell you in every detail the history of the most important sites of Ancient Greece. KUDOS will guide you through historical routes and priceless archaeological treasures located in small museums all over Greece, while also helping statues you see on the streets speak about their history.

Your contribution is very important to us; it will enable us to collect the necessary funds to create and optimize the application.

In order for KUDOS to be created, a long, difficult, but totally enjoyable process needs to be completed. The process in detail consists of three phases:
        a) Total “inventory” and detailed photographs and videos of the archaeological           sites, museums, and most important statues.        b) Creation of the KUDOS app.        c) Promotion of the application in the countries of high interest (where most               people visit Greece from) using the internet, but also within Greece in airports,           nautical ports, subway stations, etc.
Our passion for the Ancient Greek Civilization is what led us to design the KUDOS project. Our knowledge, but also the help and collaboration with scientists and practitioners from the field of Ancient Greek history, computer programming, and technological innovation, will give us all we need to live up to the high expectations of KUDOS.

Some people might not be able to contribute (and this is perfectly fine!), but that does not mean they can’t effectively help us achieve our goals: it is invaluable to us if you could contribute by promoting the app by liking our page, or by sharing the Kudos project with family, friends, and coworkers!

A high-quality hand grinder is a necessity, not a luxury, because it preserves the delicate flavors of the beans so you can extract them in the brewing process. The true deal-breaker in brewing a great cup lies in the consistency of your grind. Predictable and precise are the keywords—you want to trust that your grinder will deliver your desired consistency, with the precision your brewing method requires. If you’ve ever made the switch from espresso to pour over, then you already understand the difference between too coarse a grind and too fine and how it impacts flavor in a major way.</p><div contenteditable=""false"" data-id=""30099719""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1600124299/t6casdfa2irycgl0f22l.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>It comes down to premium parts. The VSSL Java has a best-in-class stainless steel burr, which cuts the beans to a uniform shape and size instead of pulverizing them. The steel burr reduces the grinding time and makes it easier to cut, requiring less energy than a ceramic burr, with a consistently better result. The VSSL Java also has two high-grade mini radial ball bearing sets, ensuring you’ll never “wobble” as you grind. The pressure and force you exert will apply evenly and efficiently to grinding the coffee beans to your desired consistency. The adjustment dial has 30 distinct settings, so you can obtain exactly the right grind size. Take away any one of these elements, and you get a weaker, more inconsistent result. We did everything we possibly could to allow you to extract the maximum flavor and aroma in your coffee, anywhere you decide to sit down and enjoy a cup.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p><p>Joe,  Armand, Josh, and I have over 100 years of experience in this product category - we created the first tracking device ever designed to be used on airlines for checked-in luggage - and the BSAF device, once again, will be the only tracking device fully compliant with the new airline mandates on the use of these type devices.</p><p>We are most passionate about the design of a tracking device capable of creating peace of mind when traveling or being aware of the location of special needs family members.</p><p>We have invested significant financial resources and time in bringing the BSAF product to this stage and now need your help to complete the work and bring it to life. We are ready to produce 100 prototype BSAF devices to be used by airline travelers and those who have family members with special needs such as Alzheimer's and Autism. </p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>We need approximately $100,000 to complete the Alpha test, certification attainment - FCC and airlines, supporting website and apps, and final packaging / tooling to make it ready for prototype production. This funding will be utilized over a 90 day period.</p><p>We created the Perks for your support by providing meaningful discounts on the overall price value when the BSAF product goes to market. From what we learned with the first of our successful products, at least two devices are needed to cover most ""checked baggage"" travel experiences.  Therefore, we believe our 2 pack Device Perk makes a lot of sense for sharing a device within the family.</p><p>If our funding goal is not entirely met, we will continue to work with our engineering team and get to market, however, that will delay the ultimate product delivery to the market. So, again, if our funding goal is not reached, we will look to find equity incentive programs with our suppliers to enable us to complete this final stage.  And, of course, we can go back to our own families for more support.  But, we will achieve this final stage.</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>Four billion units of luggage are checked-in annually on airline flights worldwide; 80 million arrive late, 17 million never arrive.   Though widely attributed to airline negligence, this usually occurs because, according to travel load, the 2-D bar code system literally runs out of numbers and the system is subsequently reset.  If your bag was in transit and the system reset occurred, it is impossible for the airline to track your bag, period.

We are ready to produce 100 prototype BSAF devices to be used by airline travelers and those who have family members with special needs such as Alzheimer's and Autism. What We Need & What You GetWe need approximately $100,000 to complete the Alpha test, certification attainment - FCC and airlines, supporting website and apps, and final packaging / tooling to make it ready for prototype production. This funding will be utilized over a 90 day period.We created the Perks for your support by providing meaningful discounts on the overall price value when the BSAF product goes to market. From what we learned with the first of our successful products, at least two devices are needed to cover most ""checked baggage"" travel experiences.  Therefore, we believe our 2 pack Device Perk makes a lot of sense for sharing a device within the family.If our funding goal is not entirely met, we will continue to work with our engineering team and get to market, however, that will delay the ultimate product delivery to the market. So, again, if our funding goal is not reached, we will look to find equity incentive programs with our suppliers to enable us to complete this final stage.  And, of course, we can go back to our own families for more support.  But, we will achieve this final stage.The ImpactFour billion units of luggage are checked-in annually on airline flights worldwide; 80 million arrive late, 17 million never arrive.   Though widely attributed to airline negligence, this usually occurs because, according to travel load, the 2-D bar code system literally runs out of numbers and the system is subsequently reset.  If your bag was in transit and the system reset occurred, it is impossible for the airline to track your bag, period. That's where BSAF steps in.Additionally, there are 44 million Alzheimer’s patients worldwide, 47.5 million living with dementia, and 76 million people living with autism.Whether you are a frequent airline traveler, parent or caretaker of a special needs family member, the BSAF device is designed for you.Our first product, Trakdot Luggage Tracker, was voted #1 new product introduction at the 2014 CES Trade Show and went on to sell over 50,000 units worldwide. Ultimately, its lifespan was cut short due to the anticipated rise in Internet of Things technology. As result, we learned a valuable lesson in overcoming obsolescence in the wireless world in which we live.While we know and understand the anxiety that goes with lost luggage, the four of us felt that the next generation of tracking devices - BSAF - needed to do more.   Which is why we chose to address special needs family members.  Knowing where a loved one is at all times when needed can bring no greater peace of mind.Risks & ChallengesChallenges and risks come from many directions, be it changes in technology, regulations and competitors.  Our experience with Trakdot faced all of these right up through its successful launch.We are collaborating with one of the world's largest contract manufacturers for the software engineering of BSAF - that should address the technology challenge. We have personal relationships with a number of the largest airlines in the world as well as with the regulatory agency of the FAA - that should address the regulations challenge and risk.  Our BSAF has been priced to be as much as 30 - 80% lower cost than competitive devices on the market. We believe this will be a long term competitive advantage for us.Other Ways You Can HelpNow that you understand a little more about what BSAF is all about and our mission to provide an affordable tracking device for awareness and peace of mind, we would love for you to share with us your ideas for what other uses you would see for the BSAF that we could consider in this final stage of development before we begin producing the prototype devices.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Every day when you drink coffee, you might get burned because it is too hot. Or it might get cold too fast for you to enjoy it for a longer time. Either way, the temperature of the coffee is most of the times not right.
</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/555449/files/20140503233312-c_When_Drink_Coffee.png?1399185192"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.45em;"">
For these problems, we have designed ""One Cup"" - the cup that can control the temperature of coffee.
</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.45em;"">
First, ""One Cup"" absorbs the extra thermal energy of coffee when the coffee is too hot and cools it down to drinkable temperature 3 times faster than an ordinary cup.
</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.45em;"">
Next, ""One Cup"" releases the stored energy back into the coffee when the coffee gets cold and keeps it to a drinkable temperature 2 times longer than an ordinary cup.

<p><span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.45em;"">
The amazing performance is owed to a special material sealed within the advanced ceramics shell. This material is designed to intelligently absorb &amp; release the extra thermal energy of the coffee. This is how ""One Cup"" always keeps your coffee temperature just right.

</a></p></div>","Every day when you drink coffee, you might get burned because it is too hot. Or it might get cold too fast for you to enjoy it for a longer time. Either way, the temperature of the coffee is most of the times not right.



For these problems, we have designed ""One Cup"" - the cup that can control the temperature of coffee.


First, ""One Cup"" absorbs the extra thermal energy of coffee when the coffee is too hot and cools it down to drinkable temperature 3 times faster than an ordinary cup.


Next, ""One Cup"" releases the stored energy back into the coffee when the coffee gets cold and keeps it to a drinkable temperature 2 times longer than an ordinary cup.



The amazing performance is owed to a special material sealed within the advanced ceramics shell. This material is designed to intelligently absorb & release the extra thermal energy of the coffee. This is how ""One Cup"" always keeps your coffee temperature just right.



You will love ""One Cup"" especially with hot coffee, hot tea, hot chocolate and any other hot drink you like.



All the material tech comes from NASA Tech. We have sent all the material to professional organization to be analysed to ensure it's safe.










We have been working hard for over 2 years to design & test ""One Cup"", and ready to take it into production. Therefore we received over 100 million dollars investment from Venture Capital.

*Our Indiegogo campaign is now over.    Manta Sleep Mask is designed to upgrade your sleep & life with a personalized fit.Manta is the World’s 1st Modular Sleep Mask with FreeFit - so it molds to fit your unique face.It works for 99% of all face shapes & gives you 100% blackout for your entire sleep cycle...energizing you for wherever life takes you when you wake up.Regardless of your ethnicity, age, gender, nose shape, or preferred sleeping position, Manta’s patent-pending adjustable modular eye contours create the perfect seal - because it’s specifically tailored to you.Side sleeper? Belly sleeper? Back sleeper?...we’ve got you covered.Mark Webster (Authority Hacker)

 Patent-Pending Modular FreeFitExperience the Comfort of a Personalized FitWhat if, instead of losing valuable hours of sleep (not to mention cash) trying dozens of different sleep masks, you got it right the first time?Your work would improve, you’d have more energy to go out, and your body would feel stronger.Manta Sleep Mask’s modular design, with Patent-Pending omniLAT™, offers an unprecedented level of adjustability that’s easy and intuitive to use.Because the fit is tailored to you, there’s no extra pressure on your face.The Modular Eye Contours can be adjusted freely to create a customized fit for 99% of all face shapes - including yours.  100% Total Darkness for the Entire 8 HoursSleep, UninterruptedWhat if you could sleep through the entire night without waking up even once? Imagine how much better rested you’d feel in the morning.Thanks to the 100% total blackout of the Manta Sleep Mask, you won’t experience any light leakage, meaning you’ll finally be able to sleep through the night.Regardless of your sleep position or the shape of your nose, Manta conforms to your face (and keeps the light out).Side sleeper? Belly sleeper? Back sleeper? We’ve got you covered.    The luxurious foam contour snugly conforms to the sides of your face, making sleep on your side & belly more comfortable. There is NO light leakage with Manta. Eye Contours for REM SleepSpend Less Time Sleeping & Feel More EnergeticRapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is when your brain is repaired and renewed.If you need more energy and want to feel well-rested in the morning, focus on getting more REM sleep.During REM sleep, your eyes experience rapid movements in random directions. Most sleep masks press against your face and eyes, which can interrupt this process.Manta has specially designed eye contours that encourage REM sleep.Because there is no direct contact or pressure on your eyelids, your REM cycle won’t be interrupted.Eye contours do not press against your eyelids, which allow REM sleep to occur.    Since we designed Manta Sleep Mask for ourselves, we went all out to bring you even more sleep-enhancing features.No more hair-pulling. No more pain. Micro velcro will not stick to your hair. Cotton interior ensures Breathability & Comfort. Manta feels Light & Cool. The 2 sections of the headband are made from elastics, which give you -extra comfort- as the product will STRETCH to fit your head. Limiting the elastics to only these 2 sections prevents the entire band from stretching loose with use. The total length of the product is 71cm, which will fit 99% of all head sizes. The strap is made out of plush cotton velour, so it’s soft & comfortable against your head and ears. Lightweight construction. Manta Sleep Mask is great to use while sitting up straight (such as on a plane). The silicone grip pad on the back of the mask prevents it from slipping off your head during sleep. Manta earplugs are made with memory foam to block out sound. You’re going to love the Manta Pouch. Its separated earplug compartment with a zipped closure ensures you’ll never lose your earplugs again. The mesh design has 2 advantages: 
The pouch doubles as a laundry mesh net, so you can machine wash your eye mask without damaging it. The mesh net will significantly extend the life of your Manta Mask. 
The pouch also airs out your Manta Sleep Mask when in storage or during your travels. This improves hygiene and prevents odor buildup.

<h3>The Paint Kit for Long Hauls or Short Hops</h3>
<p>Plein air painting is a rapidly growing art discipline by which artists create on location. Since location painters have to carry their art supplies with them every time they step out the door, they have to be organized. Unfortunately, <i>art</i> and <i>organized</i> and are two words not often spoken over the visually creative crowd. As a plein air painter myself, I've experienced the frustration of landing on a site and not having a paintbrush or other necessary tool.</p>
<p>So, I finally decided to do something about it.</p>
<p><strong>Keni Kit</strong> is the result.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Keni Kit </strong>has been refined to remove common (and not-so-common) obstacles to painting on location.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keni Kit </strong>has undergone rigorous field tests over the past year.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keni Kit</strong> works great, even in the most confined spaces.</li>

<p>Of course, Skiskates are not perfect and we're not scared to admit that, because most of our customers are super delighted with their purchase anyway. Here are some downsides you should be aware of before you buy Skiskates:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do all ski resorts allow the use of Skiskates on their slopes?</strong></p>
<p>Most of the ski resorts allow this kind of “short skis” on their slopes, but not all of them.<br/>Our experience is that if you act as if you were skiing with your traditional skis, no one will bother you. And if that happens anyway, argue that Skiskates are safe and the base of Skiskates is made of the exact same metal ski edges as all the other skis, which is the most common requirement of ski resorts. And don’t forget the great thing about Skiskates is that you can always use them in so many other places, like hiking trails and sledding hills.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is it hard to learn?</strong></p>
<p>Not really, it is actually pretty easy. It is as hard as learning to ski or skate. In fact, many people find it easier. However it takes some time and you will definitely fall now and then, but that’s part of the fun. Have you ever seen people ice-skating for the first time? That’s what I’m talking about. You have to keep the front-back balance, so it feels very natural to those who play ice hockey, ice skate, or even use inline skates. You are able to move freely as opposed to wearing heavy clunky skis. Falling is generally much safer than falling with skis or snowboard. Most importantly don't forget that learning is effortless if you enjoy the ride.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I use them in powder?</strong></p>
<p>Skiskates are best on groomed snow. You can use Skiskates on powder that is not thicker than +/- 20 cm (8 in). They are great on ski slopes, snow parks, sliding hills, or hiking trails, just not in deep powder. By the way, most skis are not suited for deep powder snow either. Additionally, try to avoid extremely steep slopes and ungroomed terrain full of bumps and holes.</p>

However it takes some time and you will definitely fall now and then, but that’s part of the fun. Have you ever seen people ice-skating for the first time? That’s what I’m talking about. You have to keep the front-back balance, so it feels very natural to those who play ice hockey, ice skate, or even use inline skates. You are able to move freely as opposed to wearing heavy clunky skis. Falling is generally much safer than falling with skis or snowboard. Most importantly don't forget that learning is effortless if you enjoy the ride.
 
Can I use them in powder?
Skiskates are best on groomed snow. You can use Skiskates on powder that is not thicker than +/- 20 cm (8 in). They are great on ski slopes, snow parks, sliding hills, or hiking trails, just not in deep powder. By the way, most skis are not suited for deep powder snow either. Additionally, try to avoid extremely steep slopes and ungroomed terrain full of bumps and holes.
 

 

 

 
 

 
We run this Indiegogo project in cooperation with our great partner company What To Fund, LLC based in Ogden, UT.Most of our team and our manufacturing is based in the heart of Europe, the Czech republic. We're proud to manufacture Skiskates locally in a country with a long tradition of manufacturing one of the best skis in the world! We are a small company of friends and family from a small town having a global ambition of creating the next big winter sport.

 
 
 

 

 
 

 





 
 





 


 

 
 

 
 
 What shoe size should I use?One size fits all, so don’t worry.However, we recommend Skiskates for Snowboard boots of size: 6-14.5 US / 38-49 EU. Ski boots model is also one size fits all. We recommend size range: 36-49 EU / 4.5-14.5 US / 22,5-32,5 MP. Adjustable bindings let you attach Skiskates to any Snowboard boot or Ski boot, depending on model of Skiskates you choose. What shoes should I use?Use any ski boots or snowboard boots depending on model of Skiskates you choose. We recommend waterproof quality boots that fix your ankle firmly. Is it hard to learn?Not really, it is actually pretty easy.

Most importantly don't forget that learning is effortless if you enjoy the ride. How do you stop?You can stop the same way that you stop with your skis or skates. This is also called a hockey stop. Because of their size and weight, it might not be as easy to stop with Skiskates as it is with regular skis. However, it's not really difficult either. Make sure you distribute your weight evenly over both of your Skiskates to make you stop easier and slower. Additionally, you can also slow down using a heel brake. How much is shipping?Depending on the country you are from, $19 - $49 / 1 Pair.  What is your return policy?We give you a 30 Day Money Back Guarantee because we believe in our product. Make sure that the product is unused and in the original state. Can I use them in powder?Skiskates are best on groomed snow. You can use Skiskates on powder that is not thickerthan +/- 20 cm (8 in). They are great on ski slopes, snow parks, sliding hills, or hiking trails, just not in deep powder. By the way, most skis are not suited for deep powder snow either. Additionally, try to avoid extremely steep slopes and ungroomed terrain full of bumps and holes. Do all ski resorts allow the use of Skiskates on their slopes?Most of the ski resorts allow this kind of “short skis” on their slopes, but not all of them.Our experience is that if you act as if you were skiing with your traditional skis, no one will bother you. And if that happens anyway, argue that Skiskates are safe and the base of Skiskates is made of the exact same metal ski edges as all the other skis, which is the most common requirement of ski resorts. And don’t forget the great thing about Skiskates is that you can always use them in so many other places, like hiking trails and sledding hills. Should I use wax?Of course, we recommend waxing the base regularly to make Skiskates even faster and prevent snow from sticking to the base. While you are on a ski trip, wax the base every day.   Terms and Conditions and DisclaimerSome aspects of skiing and related activities are potentially dangerous.

Built in charger allows you to charge and use your phone when on the go.
And if you lose your phone, the backpack will help you locate it.

If you lose your backpack, the built in tracker will help you find it.
Left strap has a convenient quick access pocket that's perfect for holding your cards or cash.
The backpack is cut proof, water proof, anti shock, and anti sweat all thanks to our 7-layer construction.

Main compartment is efficient at keeping your stuff safe in an organized way

Laptop and tablet pockets are perfect for short trips to a coffee shop or long trips around the world.
Electronic hackers can't hack thanks to RFID pockets. 
The utility pocket is perfect for storing your wallet, passport, or power bank.
Staying hydrated is easy with a water bottle pocket. 
(3) Smaller pockets are perfect for your watch, keys, or headphones.
Pick-pocketing: It is one of the oldest and most widespread crimes in the world. A skilled pickpocket can make off with just as much money as an armed robber, without much danger of confrontation or risk of being identified in a line-up. By the time the victim realizes what's happened, the pickpocket is long gone.All of this is bad news for the rest of us. When you're traveling, a pickpocket can easily ruin your trip. We ourselves have been victim to pick-pocketing, so that's when we decided on making Ghost, the best line of defense against pick-pocketing. Keep your items safe and sound. Hidden 360 zipper: By implementing the zipper in the backside of the bag, you'll only be able to access the bag when the backpack is off your shoulders. Meaning that all your belongings will be exactly where you left them. Secure RFID blocking pockets: Pickpockets don't even actually have to pick your pockets anymore, hackers can access your credit card data wirelessly. So we have a built in measure to stay safe even when you're unaware of a electric hacker. We have added in multiple RFID blocking pockets. Our 7 layer material means the ghost backpack is high quality, tough and long lasting.Our 7 layer material: Be ready for even the worst of pickpocket attacks. Ghost can stop slashing of knives keeping your valuables away from harms reach. If the outer shell is compromised the inner hard shell will stop any further penetration.  Ghost is also water proof and shock resistant. Looking for the best way to keep your gear safe and dry? Ghost is the answer! Durability test: This shows that Ghost can carry a 50lb dumbbell with a breeze! (Bit more than your daily essentials...) Ghost is tough and will keep all your items safe and secure. Material durability test: Ghost handles direct contact from a knife! But if the outer shell was compromised, the inner shell would do even better from keeping thieves out.  For maximum stability: The heaviest equipment is next to your back and centered in the pack. Medium-weight gear are carried toward the top and outside portion of the pack and lightweight gear at the bottom. This ensures that you have 20%-25% less stress on your back.Decrease sweat stains: Ghost allows air to flow through our padding saving you from getting big sweat spots that you get with normal packs. On the go charging: if you're looking for something more convenient, Ghost is your go to with its built in power and/or charging. If stolen or misplaced: It's scary when your valuables are no where to be found... Luckily Ghost has you covered. With its' built in tracker, you can track the last known location effortlessly. Make your phone ring with a single touch of a button on the right sleeve in case you misplace it. Simple Design: With it's minimal and sleek design, the Ghost is perfect for all genders in this style conscious and frequently on-the-go world.   Compact size for all your essentials: The Ghost Backpack features two primary storage areas, 3 secondary small pockets, laptop sleeve ( Fits laptops up to 15.4"" ), tablet sleeve ( Fits tablets up to 12.9"" ) , and quick access shoulder pockets.Ghost Backpack: This backpack is Anti theft, tough and long lasting. Keeping your items safe and secure from any potential threat.

<p>What we’ve learned from our studies in architecture is that the world around us is not about lines, shapes and forms, but it’s about the way people interpret them and the stories they build around them.</p>
<p>That is why we created these unusual travel guides! A coloring travel guide<b> inspires</b> you to color your own journey the way you want, but all the while guiding you through many beautiful places. This way, you get to be the co-author since <b>your color palette</b> will make each book unique!</p>
<p>Color Athens is the first from a series of coloring travel guides that we are planning to publish. We tried to include locations, patterns and objects that are suitable for coloring and at the same time enable you to take in the atmosphere of the city. <b>Color Athens combines the relaxing experience of a coloring book and the wandering feeling of a travel guide</b>.</p>
<p>So.. what about a blue Parthenon?! Or a yellow Caryatid?! </p>

</div></div>","Having a background in
Fine Arts and Design, we both decided not to give up on our dream,
Architecture! In Architecture school we bumped into each other and a
beautiful friendship and collaboration began! We both successfully realised our
dream and now we are off to a new one: The Coloring Travel Guides!


The truth is that the economic situation in Greece is a grey one. But what is also true is that there are many young people here full of energy, passion and creativity! We would like to think of ourselves as members of this growing community. We will do our best to bring back the color to Greece but with your help and contribution we can make it even better!!








What we’ve learned from our studies in architecture is that the world around us is not about lines, shapes and forms, but it’s about the way people interpret them and the stories they build around them.
That is why we created these unusual travel guides! A coloring travel guide inspires you to color your own journey the way you want, but all the while guiding you through many beautiful places. This way, you get to be the co-author since your color palette will make each book unique!
Color Athens is the first from a series of coloring travel guides that we are planning to publish. We tried to include locations, patterns and objects that are suitable for coloring and at the same time enable you to take in the atmosphere of the city. Color Athens combines the relaxing experience of a coloring book and the wandering feeling of a travel guide.
So.. what about a blue Parthenon?! Or a yellow Caryatid?! 

It's your call and your journey!! 




Color Athens details: 96 pages paperback, dimensions: 20 X 22 X 1 cm, shipping weight 300-350 gr



 Choose from a variety of gifts we have prepared for your contributions!




  




If we raise 9,000 euro we can print Color Athens!


If we raise more than that Color Santorini, Color
Mykonos, Color Crete and Color Thessaloniki are waiting in line!!




                ..and even
if we raise less than our goal (1,500 euro or more) Color Athens will be printed, perhaps with some small
changes (less copies -enough though for your rewards!- probably we will have to leave perforated paper out and/or
have it available only in english and greek).

One gallon of water will last up to 7-15 minutes for washing yourself or gear, depending on the flow rate you choose. Our testers found that around seven minutes is the ideal length of a refreshing shower, and that flow rate will use up to one gallon. The lowest flow rate that makes good progress with dishes/gear/etc. will last around fifteen minutes per gallon.</p><p> </p><h3>How long does it take to heat?</h3><p>There are a few heating options. The primary heating option is built into the Geyser System. It takes anywhere from 15 minutes to 35 minutes* to heat up, depending on your quantity and the initial temperature of your water.</p><p>It’s important to know that the Geyser System doesn’t heat and pump at the same time (and the pump draws much less power than the heater). So, if you want, you can use a camping stove or other method to heat some water and add that to the Geyser, and it’ll be faster than using the built-in electric heater.</p><p>If you do choose to use the built-in heating element, the Geyser System comes with an SAE adaptor and two power cables to give you two options when plugging into a 12 VDC power source. The first option is using a car charger plug, and the second cable can be used to connect to a deep cycle battery.</p><p>The water heater draws 9.5 amps drawn from your 12 VDC car charger or deep cycle battery (115 watts). If you’re using the car charger, then your car must be on to heat the water, so it doesn't drain your car’s battery. If you use a small deep cycle battery from Amazon (18 amp hour, usually found for ~$40), then you can use it to heat and pump the water once.</p><p>In pump mode, you can leave the car off and use it a couple of times without worrying about car battery draining. This is good to know if you decide to bring hot water (via a thermos or similar) and mix it with cold water. The pump draws on average 2.5 amps with peaks of 3.1 amps (30 to 36 watts).</p><p>*Results will vary depending on the initial temperature and quantity of water. Our engineering bench tests show that a full Geyser System takes 35 minutes to heat the water from 63 to 95 degrees F (17 to 35 degrees C). There are two important factors here:</p><p>1. The time to heat is faster if you use less water. Our testers found that if conserving water was essential to the expedition, they could still achieve their ""cleaning criteria"" using only half the Geyser System's worth of water. If you do that, then it takes half the normal time (8-18 minutes) to heat.</p><p>2. The time to heat is shorter if your water is warmer when you put it in. Our testers confirmed that they find it easier to pour water into the Geyser Systems situated in the back of their vehicle instead of bringing the Geyser System to a water tap. Most of the time, water is arriving to the Geyser System at room temperature of 25 C. Our engineering bench test results show that a full Geyser System take 18 minutes to heat the water from 25 to 35 degrees C. We aim to bring that down to 15 minutes with our latest heating element that will operate at the full 120 watts.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Who can use a Geyser System?</strong></h3><p>We designed this system to be safe and easy enough for a child to use. Our instructions include to never add boiling water into the system. Not only do you run the risk of damaging the pump, but also run the risk of burns and scalding. Because of this, we build a safety feature that prevents the pump from working if the water is too hot (above 113 F / 45 C).</p><p>We asked our Aussie testers to be rigorous, and they were. They kept using it outside our instructions and decided to add two coffee cups of boiling water, after adding cold water. This sped up their bathing process, since it takes around five minutes to boil water. We anticipate people doing the same and adding boiling water on top of cold water, even when instructed not to.</p><p>In an effort to design for safety while being aware of the reality of how people will use the system, we have three thermostats and a water level sensor to ensure that if the water is too hot (above 45 degrees C), it will not allow you to pump. That way, you'll never accidentally burn someone, should you or someone else forget to add cold water after adding hot water. If the pump is shut off, then you'll need to add cold water and bring it back down to 85-95 F (30-35 C) before the pump will turn on again.</p><p>The way to ensure the pump is not forced off is to add cold water first and then hot water second. Our temperature indicator will tell you how hot the water is, but you should always check the water temperature by hand before using the Geyser System.</p><p> </p><h3>How do I replace a scrub?</h3><p>It’s as easy as texting a friend. First, create an account on our webpage with your mobile number, contact, shipping, and billing information. Second, text the number on your skrub. Someone will immediately respond and give you what you need. We’ll also make sure the shipping address is right so that the skrubs arrive where you need them, since we know so many adventurers are constantly on the go!</p><p> </p><h3>What's the average life span of a scrub?</h3><h3>How much do they cost?</h3><p>Scrubs are built to last. Our scrubs can be consistently used everyday for two months with no issues. Of course, the lifespan depends on how you use and store it. You can store the scrubs in the Geyser System, however, we recommend you let the scrub dry. Do not microwave or dish wash the scrub.</p><p>Individual skrubs retail for $4.50 each plus shipping. Large quantity and subscription discounts will be announced soon.</p><p> </p><h3>What's the retail cost of the Geyser System?</h3><p>The retail cost of the Geyser Systems will be $295.00.</p><p> </p><h3>Can I use this for both washing dishes and showering?</h3><p>Yes, you can adjust the flow rate depending on the use-case. </p><p> </p><h3>Can I take a cold shower?</h3><p>Yes, you can disable the heat element and take a cold shower. The Geyser System doesn't heat and pump at the same time, so if you want to take a cool, refreshing shower, you can do that by simply adding water and going straight to pump mode.</p><p> </p><h3>What’s the poncho for? What is it made out of?</h3><p>There isn’t always a ton of privacy when you’re adventuring, so we created a Geyser change-poncho to make it easier to dry off and change your clothes without drawing attention. It’s made of a soft, synthetic microfiber (80% polyester+20% polyamide) for efficient absorption and fast drying.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/geyser-system-world-s-best-hot-portable-shower-camping-sports/payments/new?perk_id=4547205"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531767119/kxgdtxjcardqlqfpugps.png"" src=""""/></a></p></div>","How to get it!Become a backer of this project and Pick a Reward. You will be pre-ordering the Geyser System. You'll get a special backer discount!  Want to buy more than one? Check out Rewards.   The Geyser System is the World's Most Advanced Hot Portable Shower using only 1-gallon of water for up to 7-minutes of showering. The Geyser System is just 6 lbs and capable of heating your water in just 15-35 minutes*, making it perfect to take with you on your next adventure.​Both portable and powerful, the Geyser System provides an experience unlike any other, with transportable heat, consistent water pressure, and unrivaled convenience. Say goodbye to the pesky barriers that keep you from enjoying the great outdoors. Say Hello To Convenient, Comfortable and Hot Showers!   Most The Most of Every Drop: Designed with your cleaning goals in mind, the Geyser Valve gives you the capability to use the least amount of water needed to wash yourself or your gear. The result? Your water supply last you 10 times longer.    How To Back1. Choose a reward level.Everybody can choose one (and only one) reward level to back this project. You cannot choose two reward levels. Just one. You will get all items in that reward—you cannot swap things that you don't want for things that you do want.2. Relax, you're done for now.All details like shipping information and color preference will be collected via survey after this campaign has ended (and yes, it is easy to change your information if needed)    ADVANCED FEATURES Dependable & Durable: Explore to the ends of the earth with our device. We’ve engineered it with materials and mechanisms that will last as long as your desire for adventure.Easy To Store: We’ve kept the heating elements and thermostats safe from fingers and fallen objects by placing a plastic gate above them. This allows you to store the sponge  in the Geyser System between showers.Withstands Tough Elements: Each hose connector is created from non-corrosive components so that when combined with salt water the Geyser System remains as good as new.  Temperature LED Indicator: Never worry about leaving the heating element on or adding water that is too hot! Our sensors always monitor the water temperature. At 95 F (35 C), it turns the heating element off to stop drawing power. If you add water that is too hot for use, our sensor will simply shut off the pump mode until it cools. That way, no one will ever accidentally scald themselves if they forget to add cold water. Water-Level LED Indicator: Not only does it notify you to wrap up your wash, it also automatically shuts off the heating element when the water is low—this prevents the element from burning out and needing replacement down the line.Lid LED Indicator: The electrically insulated heating element will only turn on when the lid is screwed on. If, for whatever reason, the heating element isn’t insulated and the lid becomes unscrewed during use, the system will cut off electricity to prevent conductive water.  Minimal upkeep and maintenance: Simply twist off the used Geyser Scrub and re-attach the new one for easy cleanup. And like all things Geyser, we’ve made it as simple as texting a friend to reorder as many as you like, so you can have dedicated sponges for your body, dishes, and gear.   All great inventions come with great stories, and the Geyser System is no different. After spending ten years engineering and marketing advanced surgical instruments, inventor and lifelong traveler Jonathan Ballesteros decided to trade the corporate lifestyle for a 4X4 camper van and an Australian adventure. After he rigged his van and started his way across Australia, Jonathan kept discovering something interesting during his journey. While each location came with new Aussie friends and views, the complaints he heard were all the same: there was never a hot, refreshing shower.The wheels started to turn, and then inspiration hit, one fateful day in Melbourne. He needed to prepare himself for a social outing and only had a small bottle of water left. While pouring the water bottle on a rag and attempting to wipe himself down, the initial idea for Geyser hit: “What if”, he asked himself, “the rag was a sponge with a hose connected to the water bottle?”Just like that, the Geyser was born! Countless pumps and yards of pipe later, when he had a good prototype, Jonathan then set out to really test it in the field. He asked a team of designers and hardcore campers to take the original Geyser System out through the rugged and grueling parts of Australian Outback and come back with their feedback, ideas, and hesitations.What was left is Geyser as it stands today, developed and tested by the brightest of minds and most passionate of explorers.    Risks and challengesOur suppliers are qualified and tested.

 a programmer with Elevate Energy (formerly CNT Energy) -- a division of the Center for 
Neighborhood Technology in Chicago. It's a map based browser tool that shows available amenities and resources such 
as transit stations, schools, grocery stores and banks located within a 
half mile radius of an abandoned or vacant property.</strong></p><p><strong></strong>A very rudimentary version of the tool won runner up at the <a href=""http://www.cnt.org/news/2012/10/22/7050/#more-7050"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Urban Sustainability Hackathon </a>sponsored
 by CNT in October 2012.  Further efforts will be devoted to developing a
 more complete and robust database for Bronzeville.  I plan to 
accomplish this goal through my own research, along with seeking the 
cooperation of organizations and agencies already engaged in housing 
related issues, as well as gaining the cooperation of stakeholders in 
the neighborhoods where vacant and abandoned properties are located.</p><p><b>HViAB and Legally Occupy</b></p><p>This funding campaign is designed to serve as a launching pad for a larger ongoing initiative. As a result, I set my funding goal for $500, the minimum figure set by IndieGoGo. My work on developing the HViAB platform would focus on developing a sense of what amenities and resources are  available, what gaps remain, and how to bridge the gaps in successfully developing available vacant and abandoned properties.  My ultimate goal is to develop an initiative I have named Legally Occupy, which will serve as a clearinghouse to match financial resources and abandoned and vacant properties, with individuals, households and organizations seeking to develop and/or obtain affordable housing.  With an initial focus here in Chicago, the long-term goal is to replicate the HViAB platform and the Legally Occupy model nationwide.  <br/></p><p><strong>Why Bronzeville?</strong></p><p><strong></strong>As a historically and culturally significant area of 
Chicago,  Bronzeville is an ideal focus for the prototype of the HViAB tool.  The Great Migration that brought many black sharecroppers from the South to the North began in 1916, and community and cultural organizations throughout Bronzeville are actively engaged in <a href=""http://www.bviconline.info/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">several projects</a> designed to celebrate the upcoming centennial. The Black Metropolis National Heritage Area Commission is spearheading one of the most exciting initiatives, actively promoting the region as a cultural tourist destination for domestic and international travelers.
<strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Specifically Bronzeville features:</strong></strong></p><strong><strong>
</strong></strong><ul>
<li><i>An abundance of vacant and abandoned structures</i></li>
<li><i>Location close to the lakefront and downtown</i></li>
<li><i>Excellent public transportation options</i></li>
<li><i>A multitude of cultural and other desirable amenities</i></li>
<li><i>Active community involvement</i></li>
</ul><strong><strong>
<p><strong>Who I Am</strong></p></strong></strong>I am a professional writer and researcher who holds advanced degrees in sociology and law from Northwestern University. I am also a longtime Chicago area resident with extensive knowledge of Chicago's housing related issues. For instance, from 2004 to 2007, I analyzed extensive public housing demographic data concerning the Chicago Housing Authority Plan for Transformation, and contributed to writing annual reports submitted to the CHA.<br/><br/>I became involved with sustainability in general and affordable housing in particular in 2006, when I attended World Urban Forum 3 in Vancouver, Canada. Since then, I have been an invited speaker at the Chicago Green Festival in 2009, 2011 and 2012. In 2007, I launched the group Sustainable Urban Development, which now boasts nearly 10,000 members on LinkedIn. I was also invited to <a href=""http://www.chicagogreentech.org/green-tech-u-classes/schedule-and-registration?eventId=902803&amp;EventViewMode=EventDetails"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">present the HViAB platform</a> by the Chicago Center for Green Technology as part of its Green Tech U program for the Summer 2014 term.  I write about sustainability in the built environment as a guest blogger for Sustainable Cities Collective, and in my own blog, Sustainable Urban Future.<p></p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The reason I first proposed a presentation for the 2012 Chicago Green Festival on <a href=""http://sustainablecitiescollective.com/audrey-henderson/41668/sustainability-and-affordable-housing-maybe-occupy-something"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">converting abandoned buildings into affordable housing </a>was
 because I thought it was ridiculous that perfectly habitable buildings 
were standing empty while people were facing homelessness.  I still feel
 this way.  It's also all too apparent that although the economy has 
slowly begun to improve, affordable housing is an ongoing challenge. My 
ultimate hope is the HViAB tool and Legally Occupy will not only match residents who 
need housing with residences converted from vacant and abandoned 
buildings, but that this initiative will ultimately become a resource to
 promote sustainable development in Chicago and across the country.</p><strong><strong><p><strong>PLEASE CONTRIBUTE BY PAYPAL IF POSSIBLE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Funds contributed by PayPal are distributed immediately and will be put right to work in developing the fully functional demonstration HViAB tool.  Funds contributed by credit card are held until the end of the campaign (August 2014).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Specifically, funds raised toward this initial phase will:<br/></strong></p></strong></strong><p></p><ul>
<li><i>Finance GIS training through the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) -- $300</i></li>
<li><i>Finance production of t-shirt and e-book to be rewarded to donors -- varies according to amount raised.</i></li>
<li><i>Cover IndieGoGo processing fees -- varies according to amount raised.</i></li>
</ul><p><strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong><strong>Donations in excess of above listed expenses will allow me to devote specifically allotted time to the HViAB project. As an independent consultant, I am only paid for ""billable"" time.  As a result, the time I have been able to devote to this project so far has been severely limited.</strong><br/></strong></strong></p><strong><strong>

</strong></strong><br/><p></p></div>","Hidden Value in Vacant and Abandoned BuildingsI began developing the pilot project version of the Hidden Value in Abandoned Buildings (HViAB) platform withDan Fehrenbach,
 a programmer with Elevate Energy (formerly CNT Energy) -- a division of the Center for 
Neighborhood Technology in Chicago. It's a map based browser tool that shows available amenities and resources such 
as transit stations, schools, grocery stores and banks located within a 
half mile radius of an abandoned or vacant property.A very rudimentary version of the tool won runner up at the Urban Sustainability Hackathon sponsored
 by CNT in October 2012.  Further efforts will be devoted to developing a
 more complete and robust database for Bronzeville.  I plan to 
accomplish this goal through my own research, along with seeking the 
cooperation of organizations and agencies already engaged in housing 
related issues, as well as gaining the cooperation of stakeholders in 
the neighborhoods where vacant and abandoned properties are located.HViAB and Legally OccupyThis funding campaign is designed to serve as a launching pad for a larger ongoing initiative. As a result, I set my funding goal for $500, the minimum figure set by IndieGoGo. My work on developing the HViAB platform would focus on developing a sense of what amenities and resources are  available, what gaps remain, and how to bridge the gaps in successfully developing available vacant and abandoned properties.  My ultimate goal is to develop an initiative I have named Legally Occupy, which will serve as a clearinghouse to match financial resources and abandoned and vacant properties, with individuals, households and organizations seeking to develop and/or obtain affordable housing.  With an initial focus here in Chicago, the long-term goal is to replicate the HViAB platform and the Legally Occupy model nationwide.  Why Bronzeville?As a historically and culturally significant area of 
Chicago,  Bronzeville is an ideal focus for the prototype of the HViAB tool.  The Great Migration that brought many black sharecroppers from the South to the North began in 1916, and community and cultural organizations throughout Bronzeville are actively engaged in several projects designed to celebrate the upcoming centennial. The Black Metropolis National Heritage Area Commission is spearheading one of the most exciting initiatives, actively promoting the region as a cultural tourist destination for domestic and international travelers.
Specifically Bronzeville features:

An abundance of vacant and abandoned structures
Location close to the lakefront and downtown
Excellent public transportation options
A multitude of cultural and other desirable amenities
Active community involvement

Who I AmI am a professional writer and researcher who holds advanced degrees in sociology and law from Northwestern University. I am also a longtime Chicago area resident with extensive knowledge of Chicago's housing related issues. For instance, from 2004 to 2007, I analyzed extensive public housing demographic data concerning the Chicago Housing Authority Plan for Transformation, and contributed to writing annual reports submitted to the CHA.I became involved with sustainability in general and affordable housing in particular in 2006, when I attended World Urban Forum 3 in Vancouver, Canada. Since then, I have been an invited speaker at the Chicago Green Festival in 2009, 2011 and 2012. In 2007, I launched the group Sustainable Urban Development, which now boasts nearly 10,000 members on LinkedIn. I was also invited to present the HViAB platform by the Chicago Center for Green Technology as part of its Green Tech U program for the Summer 2014 term.  I write about sustainability in the built environment as a guest blogger for Sustainable Cities Collective, and in my own blog, Sustainable Urban Future.The ImpactThe reason I first proposed a presentation for the 2012 Chicago Green Festival on converting abandoned buildings into affordable housing was
 because I thought it was ridiculous that perfectly habitable buildings 
were standing empty while people were facing homelessness.  I still feel
 this way.  It's also all too apparent that although the economy has 
slowly begun to improve, affordable housing is an ongoing challenge. My 
ultimate hope is the HViAB tool and Legally Occupy will not only match residents who 
need housing with residences converted from vacant and abandoned 
buildings, but that this initiative will ultimately become a resource to
 promote sustainable development in Chicago and across the country.PLEASE CONTRIBUTE BY PAYPAL IF POSSIBLE.
Funds contributed by PayPal are distributed immediately and will be put right to work in developing the fully functional demonstration HViAB tool.  Funds contributed by credit card are held until the end of the campaign (August 2014).
Specifically, funds raised toward this initial phase will:
Finance GIS training through the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) -- $300
Finance production of t-shirt and e-book to be rewarded to donors -- varies according to amount raised.
Cover IndieGoGo processing fees -- varies according to amount raised.
Donations in excess of above listed expenses will allow me to devote specifically allotted time to the HViAB project. As an independent consultant, I am only paid for ""billable"" time.  As a result, the time I have been able to devote to this project so far has been severely limited.
Other Ways You Can Help
Please ""like"" the Legally Occupy andKnowledge Empowerment
 pages on Facebook to help spread the word!  If you're not on Facebook, 
email or plain old word of mouth will do just fine! 
Please also feel free to contact me through this campaign to share resources that you know of
 in and around Chicago concerning affordable housing, or to ask 
questions about the HViAB tool.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Frequently Asked Questions</p>
<p><strong>Is there a power bank included in the sling?</strong></p>
<p>No, the sling will be delivered without the power bank.</p>
<p>There is a simple connection inside the sling that makes sure that you can easily connect all power banks that are on the market (by USB plug).</p>
<p>This way the power bank will never be outdated and you can keep using new models to charge your devices. This bag is designed to last!</p>
<p><strong>Is the lock included in the sling?</strong></p>
<p>No, the lock can be added as an add-on. Hint: Scroll up for instructions on how to back the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>What are the shipping costs?</strong><br/>Shipping varies from country to country. There is just a small surcharge applied at checkout. Simply click on the pledge and select your delivery country, you will automatically see what the shipment costs are for your selected country.</p>
<p><strong>What is the content of the sling?</strong></p>
<p>The Go Sling Pro will hold up to 5L at full capacity.</p>
<p><strong>What is the weight of the sling?</strong></p>
<p>The weight of the sling empty (with the strap) is 650 grams.</p>
<p><strong>Is the sling 100% waterproof?</strong></p>
<p>The sling is triple-coated with a water repellent spray, but it is not waterproof.</p>
<p>This means that in normal rain conditions, you should be safe and all your items will stay dry. However, the bag is not intended to protect your valuables when thrown in a pool, body of water or to be in a full rain pour for about an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Is the sling washing machine proof?</strong></p>
<p>The sling is not washing machine proof. However, since the whole bag is covered with a water-repellent coating, the sling is already better protected against dirt and stains attaching to the fabric.<br/>Furthermore, it is easily washable with a wet cloth or wipes.</p>
<p><strong>What payment methods do you accept?</strong></p>
<p>For this project, we can only accept payment by Credit Card, no other payments methods.<br/>If there is a problem with the payment with your CC, please contact the customer support team of Indiegogo, as they are in charge of collecting the payments.</p>
<p><strong>Can I pay extra to get an earlier delivery?</strong></p>
<p>This is unfortunately not possible. It is not a matter of extra costs, but a matter of making sure that we ship out all the bags in the most efficient way as possible. However, there will be 200 sling bags available for early delivery if you pledge for the Early Delivery reward.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot make exceptions to this process as it will delay all the other shipments.</p>
<p><strong>Will I have to pay duties/VAT to receive my order?</strong></p>
<p>We will do all we possibly can to prevent this from happening, but any applicable duties/VAT are the sole responsibility of the backer.</p>
<p>We have absolutely no control over the additional duties/VAT that may or may not be charged in your country. If you are unsure whether or not you will be charged duties/VAT at the time of receiving your perk, please get in touch with your local post office.</p>
<p>The bags will be shipped from Hong Kong, this will help you to calculate the costs.</p>
<p><strong>Can I get a refund if I change my mind?</strong></p>
<p>For live campaigns, you can cancel at any time. Once the campaign moves into InDemand, you have 11 days after you pledge to cancel.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I fill in my delivery address?</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the project, we will send out a survey to all our backers.

<p><strong>Will we receive a tracking number for our shipment?</strong></p>
<p>All backers will receive a personal tracking number with which they can trace their shipment.</p>
<p><strong>Can I pick up my delivery?</strong></p>

We all love to travel. Just being in a new place can exude in us a sense of freedom. When we're travelling or exploring, many of us like to capture those epic moments with our cameras. But camera gear isn't cheap and most camera bags are not equipped to protect your precious gear from prying eyes. The solution? A stylish, compact travel bag equipped with anti-theft features. A bag that makes you feel at ease when taking the crowded metro in Paris or New York.
 
A BAG DESIGNED FOR TRAVEL

Introducing Go Sling Pro: A compact travel bag that can easily be converted to a camera bag and viceversa. It's designed to safely carry your DSLR and lens...and then some. We've revamped an old favourite, to make it even more relevant to today's lifestyle. It comes with slash resistant Kevlar that is 5 times stronger than steel, lockable zippers, which allow you to lock the bag for extra security against pickpockets, cutproof strap and an external USB port so you never run out of battery again. Aesthetically designed and extremely functional.  
 

STRETCH GOALS

 
WHAT MAKES GO SLING PRO SO SPECIAL?
Perfect for your around town photo ops or photo worthy getaway. The Go Sling Pro's magnetic strap buckle allows you to effortlessly remove the bag. Quick access main compartment allows access for you to get to your camera quickly, and its modular construction allows you to fit a range of gear. You'll be amazed at this bag's versatility.
 
Anti-Theft Features
Travellers can be easy targets for pickpockets. Travellers with flashy camera bags are even greater targets for pickpockets. The Go Sling Pro comes with integrated anti-theft features to make it theft proof.

<h3>The Forest Folk Magazine</h3>
<p>The idea to start the magazine was born about six months ago, sometime in September 2016.. </p>
<p>Some of you might know me as @theforestkind on Instagram - and, you guessed it: I just love the forest, trees, plants and nature. I've been passionate about outdoor living and activities (especially with kids) for a long time and having a wild child just encouraged this passion even more..</p>
<p>But not only do I love outdoor activities+nature, I also love learning about the plants, trees, weeds etc I find there. What to do with them, how to use them and what they are good for.</p>
<p>The possibilities to learn, make, create and experience in the forest are endless!</p>
<p>Combining outdoor living with slow living, herbalism, bushcraft, art, care and many more with each other is the aim of the Forest Folk Magazine. </p>
<p>As the idea of the Magazine became clearer and clearer, I began looking for suitable contributors and experts in these fields (well knowing I could never do it all myself), but little did I know that I will find the most amazing team to help me forming my ideas into an actual magazine! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Yeah, like always, in the end it all comes down to money..</p>
<p>Ideally and realistically we will need to fund the first two issues to be on the safe side and  to ensure  the magazines future..</p>
<p>By buying your copy and choosing the perks that you like most, you will not only help us making the dream of the magazine come true and ensure its future, you will also be rewarded the best value for your money+exclusive perks that no one after the campaign will be able to get.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Uh.. And did you know you're helping the environment too?</h3>
<p>We will not only print on recycled paper with non-toxic inks, but we will also plant a tree for every issue sold! (Locally and native trees, so be prepared to see us getting our hands dirty!)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Can't contribute right now? </h3>
<p>Don't worry!! We understand.. But you could still help us by sharing our campaign, telling your friends about it and joining our journey on social media!</p>

Who we are
We are New York City Firefighters' Bravest Skydiving Club (Bravest Skydiving Club, Inc).  We are a non-profit organization that exists to promote the sport of skydiving within the ranks of the FDNY by making the sport affordable, safe, and fun while sharing the thrills that can only be found by jumping out of perfectly good airplanes. We are committed to the safety of our members, raising money for charitable organizations, and following the guidance of the United States Parachute Association.
The Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) is the largest municipal fire department in the United States, and the second largest department in the world.  The FDNY has many fraternal and sport organizations, but none quite like our Skydiving Club.

<h3>About Us </h3>
<p>Dear Backers,</p>
<p>I’m Frank, co-founder of Norshire. I originally thought about the idea of Norshire around two years ago when I was living in Australia. I love road trips. I have been in many situations on the road such as dead battery in the middle of nowhere, or no water source or electric plug for washing my car. I was trying to find a product on the market which was small enough yet powerful with multiple functionalities. But I couldn’t find a perfect one. One day, my friend Anthony told me “It’s a fantastic idea! Why don’t you create a new product?” Here I am since then.</p>
<p>Norshire now is a team of 20 talented engineers, designers and marketers. We spent the past 1.5 years creating, designing and developing this product to provide every customer the best experience.</p>
<p>Thanks for your great support! I hope Norshire can become your perfect travel kit!</p>

<h3>A Little About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Matthew and I live in Jelenia Góra, which is a beautiful city located within the Lower Silesian Voivodeship, close to the Kakonosze mountain range running along the Polish-Czech border.</p>
<p>I love my city and my country.  When people around the world hear of Poland, it is usually in the context of WWII.  That was a long time ago and Poland is now a beautiful country.</p>
<p>I want you to see Poland the way I do, with all its splendor, amazing people, delicious food and incredible history.</p>
<p>With your contributions, you will help me achieve my dreams of becoming a Vlogger, riding around this amazing country and showing the world what it has to offer.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The best way to Vlog about Poland is traveling the country by motorcycle.  Your contributions will go towards the purchase of a new motorcycle, which will be used to tour the country.  Throughout my travels I plan to bring you videos and photos (including some of my funny blooper clips) of hidden gems within Poland, and of course great places to eat and drink :)</p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal, the funds will go into an investment and saved until I am able to put a down-payment on a new bike.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Poland has typically been know for its involvement during WWII.  Poland has grown a lot since then and we are known for much more today then what the history books say.  Their are great places to visit around the world , but once I show you Poland, you will want to visit here instead ;)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Is this campaign without risk, of course not.  What campaign has no risk?  My Vlog is a one-man-show.  I ride, I take the videos and photos, I bring you Poland.  I am the man behind the camera, in front of the camera and behind the computer, but I am also a new father and that in itself, is the greatest challenge. My dream is not just for me, it's also for my family.  I want to provide them with the best future I can.  Some days I may be unable to ride, but I can always Vlog.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that not everyone can contribute funds to my campaign, but you can still help by spreading the word.  Share my campaign on your favorite motorcycle forums, Facebook pages or tourist sites, with your friends, family and co-workers.  Anything you can do to help me achieve my dream will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>The headset has a number of sensors built in. There's an EEG, or electroencephalography sensor, which measures electrical activity in the brain. There's an EOG or electro-oculography sensor that measures eye movements by monitoring the electrical potential between the front and back of the human eye. There's an EMG, or electromyography sensor, that measures electrical activity in response to a nerve's stimulation of muscles. It also has gyros and accelerometers, and patented gear built in to amplify signal and squash noise from the finicky brain and nerve sensors.</p>

                 Meet the drone can be controlled with Hands-free     
                                                 
Activate a drone with brain electrical impulses is NO longer science fiction!  Now with UDrone, all you need to do is imagining the drone lifting off the ground and voilà – it does!
 

                        Forget about voice controls or touchscreen gestures. Controlling a drone without your hands is the ultimate way to interface.  Spark your aerial creativity anywhere, and seize all your magical moments with UDrone.   UDrone is easy to launch: concentrate and imagine the drone taking off. Once your concentration level is up to 150, the drone will whirr, rise, and buzz through the air with zero delays.                            
                                                  
 


 
 

 


 



 


 
Through a series of complex algorithms, we are able to integrate Brain-Computer Interface [BCI] technology, Somatosensory Interaction technology, and Image Recognition capabilities into one intelligent piece - UMind Lite, the brain-sensing hand band.

 
The headset has a number of sensors built in. There's an EEG, or electroencephalography sensor, which measures electrical activity in the brain. There's an EOG or electro-oculography sensor that measures eye movements by monitoring the electrical potential between the front and back of the human eye. There's an EMG, or electromyography sensor, that measures electrical activity in response to a nerve's stimulation of muscles. It also has gyros and accelerometers, and patented gear built in to amplify signal and squash noise from the finicky brain and nerve sensors.

The brain-sensing headband can read your brain waves, measure your brain electrical activity, track your slight facial movements, and convert these signals into instructions to control drone movements.




Hands-free flying with mind-and-gesture-controls and subject tracking
Powerful AI camera system with real-time image transmission 
Capture photos by blinking your eyes or with a “V” hand gesture 


Facial tracking allows drone camera to capture at a perfect angle
Auto-flight control system maintains stability during flying 


Three adjustable speed settings to accommodate the pilot’s preference 
Small, lightweight, portable, and fits perfectly in your backpack  



                            Taking pictures is literally easy as a blink: blink your eyes twice, and the photo is captured. Its hands-free setting takes the shake out of the shot, making you look like a pro photographer.     UDrone features Gesture Recognition function, that you can shoot in Auto Mode when you make the Peace Sign. In addition, the powerful AI camera system of UDrone automatically adjusts camera focus, exposure, and position to ensure your face is ideally displayed in the frame. All you need to do is act naturally. You can adjust the altitude by imagining, adjust the flying direction by tilting your head left and right, and land the drone by biting your teeth.   ACTUAL FOOTAGE Shot by UDroneAcutely sensitive to light and colors, the HD camera of UDrone captures stunning aerial images and videos. All UDrone images are consistently sharp and vivid with very little color aberration and distortion.UDrone's camera features an f/2.8 wide-angle lens and a 1/3.2 inch Sony CMOS sensor, allowing you to shoot stabilized video at 1080P and stills at 8 MP.          Once the drone is up in the air, you can view the real-time camera feed on the UDrone app and sync footages shot onto your Android or IOS device instantly.  Tracking a certain subject on the move or from different angles? You can initiate focus on the subject, and the camera will do the rest. Our advanced Subject Tracking Camera can even identify a certain person and record continuously with Auto-follow as the person moves in the crowd.UDrone can add extra dimensions to your Vlogs. The drone can track and continually focus on you while you are moving, walking, or talking. With UDrone, Vloggers can create remarkable footages with a completely different perspective. 

The Auto-Flight control system enables the drone to find the perfect balance in air pressure. This means that the drone can precisely hover in the midair to get that perfect shot video or selfie every time. And even with its compact size, the acceleration sensor with three rotors enables the drone to maintain stability in flight.

The Optical Flow technology is the distribution of apparent velocities of movement of brightness pattern in an image or the pattern of apparent motion of objects with the relative motion between an observer and a scene. Putting it in a simple way to understand the concept is the drone can detect the motion of movement to locate the subject and fly more balanced.  It is a feature that works by having a downward-facing camera “view” the ground surface while sending a continuous flow of optical feedback to the flight controller which then makes flight adjustments to keep the drone in its position.  As a result, the drone will take better photos than other drones.


The drone comes in three adjustable speed settings including indoor, outdoor, and open ground to accommodate different flying environments. Whether you are indoor or outdoor, on the road or at home, U-Drone can be a perfect add-on to your magical moments. 
Here are few ideas of how you can use it: attending concerts; home gatherings and house parties; hiking, jogging, and other outdoor activities; Youtube Vlogging; sightseeing, road trips, and traveling; interacting with your little ones; concentration training; or simply recording any small aspects of your daily!

 
 

 



 

Flying with your mobile device as the remote controller is an alternative option. The UDrone mobile APP allows you to command the drone conveniently and effortlessly. It only takes you a few minutes to learn the tricks of flying.  

For those who want a traditional manual control or in case you have not master operate the drone by your mind, you can always use APP to control it.

 

 
                                        At the size of your palm, the 85g UDrone is extremely compact, lightweight, and portable. Its portability and convenience of use make it an excellent choice for hikers and travel photographers.                                       Compared with heavier drones in the market, UDrone generates less momentum during crashes, thanks to its crafted lightweight design and the protective bumpers, effectively preventing the drone from destruction in case of crashes. Control with APPU-Drone can fly for up to 60 meters away from your phone, and up to 60 meters above from the ground. For first time users, we recommend keeping the drone within 20 meters from you. Control with the headband UMind Lite When you command the drone with your mind, UDrone can fly for up to 20 meters away from you, and up to 2.5 meters above the ground. UDrone can fly for up to 25 minutes in one charge, giving you enough duration for daily use.

Who are these people that give you tips? Why do they recommend something? What ist their agenda? Do they have the same taste like me? Wouldn’t it be great to have access to the sources you trust the most – anytime and anywhere – cutting out the noise from the anonymous crowd? And if you found a great place yourself, wouldn’t it be nice to save it easily and decide who can see your new found treasure – thus protecting your privacy?</span><br/></p>

<p>That is the core idea of myLike: your private ‘black book' that enables you to find, save and share great locations and services within your circles of trust: your friends and personal network. At the same time you can store great places where you have been or want to visit – and you decide who can see each of them – only you or the ones you decide should see them. Apart from that all the content is user-generated – with real identities behind it – which protects the network from being falsified by fake reviews.</p>

myLike – Your personal tool to discover, save & share fantastic places with the people you trust

Don’t you also feel the lack of trust in the results when you search the web for new places? Who are these people that give you tips? Why do they recommend something? What ist their agenda? Do they have the same taste like me? Wouldn’t it be great to have access to the sources you trust the most – anytime and anywhere – cutting out the noise from the anonymous crowd? And if you found a great place yourself, wouldn’t it be nice to save it easily and decide who can see your new found treasure – thus protecting your privacy?

That is the core idea of myLike: your private ‘black book' that enables you to find, save and share great locations and services within your circles of trust: your friends and personal network. At the same time you can store great places where you have been or want to visit – and you decide who can see each of them – only you or the ones you decide should see them. Apart from that all the content is user-generated – with real identities behind it – which protects the network from being falsified by fake reviews.

So, plan your next romantic night out – or your trip to NYC – based on tips by people you trust … and never forget your own travel highlights again – with myLike! 


 




We are not an anonymous recommendation platform. We protect your privacy – you have full control of what you wish to share (or not) with whom. 
myLike lets you access your trusted sources anywhere and anytime. What’s good is not determined by the mainstream, but only by you and your friends. 








myLike is a platform for personalised points of interest (POI) like restaurants, hotels, beaches, places of great natural beauty, perfect anchoring spots, or simply a great spot for your outdoor workout – locations you’ve discovered yourself or that were recommended by trusted sources. And who could be more close and trusted than your own friends? 


myLike is an easy-to-use app that allows you to save, organise, and share your favourite spots with people you care about if you like.
myLike is initially available as an iOS and Android app – a desktop and web version will follow soon, as well as a smartwatch integration. 


















Uwe Hering: Founder & CEO


Uwe founded myLike because he wanted to get and share trustworthy tips – without drowning in data or giving up on his privacy. The electrical engineering graduate has already worked for several successful start-ups as a product, sales, and marketing manager – myLike is his first self-founded project. He loves sport, travel, and great food and has lived in Canada, Ireland, and the USA.





Marc Schallehn: Co-Founder & CTO





Co-founder Marc was enthusiastic about Uwe's idea of myLike and has since been responsible for the technical implementation of the platform.He studied computer science at the University of Munich and is self-employed for over 20 years in software engineering and IT-Consulting for both small startups and large corporations. In theory, he also has hobbies, but currently too little time to take care of them.







Anja Wilbert: UX/UI Queen

Anja is the key-responsible person for the user interface of myLike – with her help everybody finds his way around and has fun using the platform. She brings a wealth of experience from working on MMIs (Man-Machine-Interface) in the automotive and industrial sector. She loves to travel and take her mountain bike for a spin.




Steffen Schwarzer: Mister Business Development




Steffen ensures myLike’s market success. With several years of start-up experience under his belt, a diploma in business management (IBS), and plenty of experience abroad – a. o. in the USA and the United Arab Emirates – he’s perfectly positioned to give myLike its well-deserved boost. Steffen thrives on great food, travelling, classic cars, and sports.



Sigrid Lorenz: Mistress of CI-Design-UI

Sigrid takes care of myLike’s look and feel. After 15 years in communications design with a focus on brand development and corporate design, interdisciplinary design of print/online communications, and event design, plus a communications design diploma from the Hochschule für Gestaltung Schwäbisch Gmünd (… just like Anja!) she knows exactly what it takes to make the app and brand look good. When she’s not perfecting our design, she loves music, singing, travel, the sea, and delicious food.

DANKE! 
 Wir wollen allen danken, die uns so grossartig in unserer Kampagne unterstützt haben und dazu beigetragen haben, dass wir unser Ziel von $20 000 erreicht haben! 
 Wir sind jetzt “InDemand”, das heisst jeder der unsere tollen Perks zuvor verpasst hat, hat jetzt immer noch die Chance Teil unseres Projektes zu werden!







myLike – Deine persönliche App um tolle Plätze zu entdecken, zu speichern und mit den Leuten zu teilen denen Du vertraust

 
Vertraust Du den Vorschlägen aus dem Internet wenn Du nach tollen Plätzen suchst? Nicht wirklich, denn Du weisst nicht wer die Leute sind und warum sie Dir etwas empfehlen. Haben sie den gleichen Geschmack wie Du?  Wäre es nicht wunderbar wenn Du immer und jederzeit Zugriff auf die Empfehlung von Leuten haben könntest denen Du vertraust - Deine Freunde. Und wenn Du selber einen tollen Platz gefunden hast, wäre es nicht toll ihn einfach speichern zu können und dabei zu entscheiden ob und wer ihn sehen kann.





Das ist die Grundidee von myLike: Dein kleines, digitale, mobile ""schwarzes Buch"" das die ermöglicht tolle Plätze zu entdecken, zu speichern und mit den Leuten zu teilen denen Du vertraust - Deine Freunde und Netzwerke. Speichere einfach die Plätze die Du besucht hast oder sehen willst - und Du entscheidest ob andere diese sehen können. In myLike ist der gesamte Inhalt von den Nutzern generiert - mit einer klaren Identität dahinter und Du entscheidest ob Du ihm vertraust oder nicht.





Wir sind keine anonyme Empfehlungsplattform. Wir schützen Deine Privatsphäre – Du entscheidest, was genau Du mit wem teilen möchtest (oder auch nicht).
Du kannst jederzeit und überall auf die Quellen zugreifen, denen Du vertraust. Bei myLike entscheidet nicht die anonyme graue Masse was gut ist sondern nur Du und Deine Freunde. 









myLike ist eine Plattform für personalisierte Points of Interests (POIs), wie Restaurants, Hotels aber auch Strände, Ausblickspunkte, Buchten zum Ankern oder ein toller Ort um Sport zu machen – die Du selbst gefunden hast oder von vertrauten Quellen empfohlen werden. Und wer ist Dir vertrauter als Deine Freunde?
myLike, die einfach zu bedienende App, die Deine Lieblingsorte einfach organisiert, findet und mit Freunden teilt – wenn Du das möchtest.
myLike startet zunächst als App für iOS und Android – die Desktop bzw. Webversion folgt später – ebenso die Smartwatch-Anbindung.



 





















Uwe Hering: The Founder & CEO



Uwe gründete myLike aus dem Wunsch heraus, vertrauenswürdige Tipps zu erhalten und zu teilen – ohne Datenüberflutung und unter Schutz der eigenen Privatsphäre. Uwe hat Elektrotechnik studiert und schon in anderen erfolgreichen Start-Ups als Produkt Management-, Marketing- und Vertriebsleiter gearbeitet – myLike ist sein erstes selbst gegründetes Projekt. Er liebt Sport, Reisen gutes Essen und hat in USA, Canada und Irland gelebt.




Marc Schallehn: The Co-Founder & CTO





Dipl. Informatiker Marc war von Uwes Idee für myLike von Anfang an begeistert und ist seitdem als Co-Founder für die technische Realisierung der Plattform zuständig. Er studierte an der Universität in München Informatik und ist seit über 20 Jahren selbständig in der Softwareentwicklung und IT-Beratung sowohl für kleine Startups als auch große Konzerne tätig. Theoretisch hat er auch Hobbies, nur aktuell zu wenig Zeit um sich darum zu kümmern.







Anja Wilbert: The UX/UI Queen

Anja ist hauptverantwortlich für das User Interface von myLike – damit sich alle damit gut zurecht finden und es Spaß macht. Sie hat jahrelange Industrieerfahrung im Bereich MMI (Man-Machine-Interface) für den Bereich Automotive und industrielle Software. Anja studierte Industriedesign an der hfg – Hochschule für Gestaltung Schwäbisch Gmünd. Sie liebt Mountain Biken und Reisen.




Steffen Schwarzer: Mister Business Development





Steffen sorgt dafür, dass myLike im Markt erfolgreich ist. Er hat jahrelange Start-Up Erfahrung, hat Betriebswirtschaft in Berlin studiert und zeitweise in den USA und den Arabischen Emiraten gelebt. Wenn sich der Dipl. Betriebswirt (IBS) gerade nicht mit myLike beschäftig, mag er gutes Essen, Reisen, alte Autos und Sport.



Sigrid Lorenz: Mistress of CI-Design-UI

Sigrid sorgt dafür, dass myLike und alles drum herum gut aussieht. Sigrid arbeitet seit über 15 Jahren im Bereich Kommunikationsdesign mit den Schwerpunkten Markenentwicklung / Corporate Design, interdisziplinärer Gestaltung von Print-/Onlinekommunikation und Eventdesign. Ihr Diplom als Kommunikationsdesignerin absolvierte sie an der Hochschule für Gestaltung Schwäbisch Gmünd (aha ... so wie Anja!). Außer ihrem Job liebt sie Musik, Singen, Reisen, das Meer und gutes Essen.

Nothing is quite as exhausting as arriving to your destination fatigued, stressed, & irritable.  Our newest venture, VascoPillow, is designed to relieve the pain and fatigue frequent flyers often experience. We hope you believe that travel should be a joy, not a pain in helping us bring this project to live!The Vascopillow’s patented memory foam construction holds a two-fold purpose for you. First, it supports the proper alignment of your neck. Your C4, C5, C6, and C7 (the most frequently complained about vertebrae) remain in proper alignment and never grind against each other, keeping you pain-free. More so, the memory foam design doesn’t fall. It always bounces back to its original shape, ensuring that your neck is protected now, tomorrow - and even 10 -15 years from now!Massage has been used by cultures for years for healing and fast recuperation from injury. Your VascoPillow includes a special massage design for maximum relief and comfort. Instead of the typical vibration many neck massagers claim to have, the VascoPillow has a rhythmic pattern of massage that replicates a traditional, deep-tissue Shiatsu massage. It relieves stress and pressure in the neck, as well as releasing tension in the muscle fibers of the neck and trapezius. You’ll arrive to your destination feeling stress-free & relaxed with NO tension in your neck or shoulders. It’s like having a personal masseuse on your entire flight!    Some of the world’s highest-level athletes utilize heat therapy to heal and recover faster from debilitating injuries. Not only that, but Consumer Reports states that over 30 million individuals have trouble sleeping on airplanes.  Now, the VascoPillow gives you the same benefit during your travels. By utilizing heat therapy, it promotes blood flow and circulation through your body. Although you’re not moving around on the plane, you benefit from the treatment of increased circulation from the heat of the VascoPillow. Not only do you feel more refreshed during the flight, but you’re also energetic with pep-in-your-step as soon as you land.The dermatologist-tested, extra soft material feels better & softer than a luxury down comforter. Incredibly soft, incredibly pliable – and more comfortable and relaxing than a spa treatment. Firm, soft, and very comfortable. You’ll be absolutely blown away by how soft it is, and impressed at how comfortable and relaxed you’ll feel during and AFTER the flight The great thing about the Vasco Pillow is its versatility. Whether it’s a cross-country trip or an evening relaxing on the couch, you’ll have the same benefits and MORE from your Vascopillow. Busy executives – you may even use the pillow in the office!  Our team specializes in design, technology and marketing. We are enthusiasts who love their craft and create innovative products that help people simplify and improve their lives. Our Founder - Artur Stelmakh, has launched successful campaigns earlier (Vasco packing cubes and bags) via Kickstarter. We’ve succeeded in getting our products to Lowe’s and QVC after crowdfunding campaigns. We believe the VascoPillow will benefit everyone, and we’re honored to help you travel comfortably & easier. You deserve to quickly and easily travel for work, or an unforgettable journey. We want you to enjoy your travels, and we know with your support you will! Thank you!",42.0,0,"5 Campaigns

Tom's input &amp; testing was key in shaping the outcome of the MIZUCHI rod prototypes, we even let him name the rod.</p><p>Tom had a few goals in mind that he wanted in a small stream Tenkara rod that would make him more efficient fishing his creeks and overgrown streams. </p><h3>It must:</h3><p><strong>1)</strong>  be no shorter than 240 cm length. I have found that shorter rods don't cast well (at least for me). 240 cm is about as short as I can effectively cast using the traditional overhead or side arm cast.</p><p><strong>2)</strong>  be able to ""zoom"" to a longer (not just longer, but practical and usable) length for use when the canopy opens up and a longer reach is desired (beaver ponds, meadow sections, an opening in the trees, etc).</p><p><strong>3) </strong> have excellent balance at all lengths, especially in the fully extended length (in other words, it shouldn't feel great in the short length and weirdly heavy at the longer length).</p><p><strong>4)</strong>  have a flex action appropriate for the intended use of the desired length. For example, at the short length it must have a fast hook set and fish fighting control over rod loading during casting (it must cast well but that's not the top priority in the short length; power to hook and control the fish is). But in the long length it must have excellent rod loading and line control, and still maintain fish fighting power. Hook set speed now takes a back seat as the canopy is more open allowing a larger hook set arc (and the hook set should not be too stiff so to launch small trout out into the trees).</p><p><strong>5)</strong> be dull in finish and non flashy in color scheme. I fully believe that rod flash and bright colors make me more visible to the trout when I'm only 8-10 feet away (in the clear waters of my home).</p><p><strong>6)</strong> have great sling shot casting abilities (other name is bow and arrow cast). I want to launch the fly into tight places without having to pull the fly past my ear. Sling casting is mainly needed in the 240 cm length and is not quite as critical at long rod lengths. Also, it must have excellent non-traditional casting capabilities like flip casting and air roll casting.</p><p><strong>7)</strong> be robust so to handle the unique stresses of a small creek. But it should also have great customer service and be easily and economically repaired if breakage does happen.</p><p><strong>8)</strong> be able to be completely disassembled for drying and cleaning.</p><p>With those goals in mind he contacted us and we went through several prototypes before finally creating a prototype rod that met all those goals. I can't say the prototype rod is perfect but it is truly an awesome Tenkara rod for small streams or open water, we are a bit ecstatic about how the final product prototype turned out.</p><p><strong>Tom Commented:</strong> ""I fished the prototype rods (all iterations) on a variety of small creeks. It casts extremely well, hooks quickly, controls trout in slow and fast water and is a joy to use. The rod is robust, like all of DRAGONtail rods, and held up to every abuse I could give it. Needless to say I was very pleased how things turned out.

For those of you who don't know</h2><p>It is basically a form of fixed line fly fishing with origins from the mountains of Japan. Tenkara fishing uses a long (commonly 10-13ft) telescopic rod with NO REEL. A short light weight line (about the length of the rod) is tied to the tip of the rod, with about 3-4ft of tippet and a fly on the end.</p><p>The gear is simple and the basics are easy to learn so you can start catching fish early on in the learning process. That being sad, you can spend a lifetime learning different different casting presentations and fly manipulations techniques that go way beyond the basics.</p><p><a href=""https://dragontailtenkara.com/mizuchi-zx340-zoom-tenkara-rod/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566436745/btp1fhteahannewbwbp3.jpg"" src=""""/></a></p><h3>Some of the big advantages of Tenkara fishing gear is:</h3><ul>
<li>Simple, light-weight and compact telescopic rod that can be packed with you anywhere (it is very popular for hikers, bike packing). The rod collapses down to about 2ft long with no reel; so the only other gear you need to carry is a small spool with your line, some tippet, and some flies.</li>
<li>The long rod and short light line allow you to create a triangle keeping the majority of your  line off the water so you get a perfect drift with little effort. You can reach over current, guide your fly around obstructions, or guide your fly to drift into the perfect hole.</li>
<li>Having a tight line to your fly gives you the ability to perform fly manipulation techniques with the slightest twitches, allowing you to temp fish to strike your fly when a dead drift does not work well.</li>
<li>There is no reel to mess with! This means line management and less fuss and more enjoying what is around you.</li>
<li>It is quick to learn the basics and fun to learn new ways to present and manipulate your flies.</li>

We here at DRAGONtail Tenkara are constantly trying to make our rods & gear better by getting feedback from experienced anglers.

I can't say the prototype rod is perfect but it is truly an awesome Tenkara rod for small streams or open water, we are a bit ecstatic about how the final product prototype turned out.Tom Commented: ""I fished the prototype rods (all iterations) on a variety of small creeks. It casts extremely well, hooks quickly, controls trout in slow and fast water and is a joy to use. The rod is robust, like all of DRAGONtail rods, and held up to every abuse I could give it. Needless to say I was very pleased how things turned out. ""Read Tom's Full Review of the MIZUCHI prototype rod HERE >>( Video from some of Tom's Testing below )

 
3-Tenkara-Rods-In-One For Tight Spots and Open WaterThe MIZUCHI 340zx Tenkara rod can be fished at 3 different lengths with its two locking zoom sections, making it an excellent choice for small stream fishing to open water fishing.The 11ft (340cm) long length is excellent for when you have open casting room such as wider sections of the stream, a river, or even on still water. The 11ft length is a great general purpose length for a Tenkara rod that will work great in most types of water where there is room to cast. The 9.6ft (290cm) middle length is great when the stream or canopy are a bit to tight for a long rod but don't require a super short rod.And the short 8ft (240cm) length is perfect for when there is lots of canopy overgrowth. You can also perform an excellent bow-n-arrow cast if things are to tight for this length.These 3 different lengths in one rod allow you to cover many different waters with the same rod.What is Tenkara? For those of you who don't knowIt is basically a form of fixed line fly fishing with origins from the mountains of Japan. Tenkara fishing uses a long (commonly 10-13ft) telescopic rod with NO REEL. A short light weight line (about the length of the rod) is tied to the tip of the rod, with about 3-4ft of tippet and a fly on the end.The gear is simple and the basics are easy to learn so you can start catching fish early on in the learning process. That being sad, you can spend a lifetime learning different different casting presentations and fly manipulations techniques that go way beyond the basics.Some of the big advantages of Tenkara fishing gear is:
Simple, light-weight and compact telescopic rod that can be packed with you anywhere (it is very popular for hikers, bike packing). The rod collapses down to about 2ft long with no reel; so the only other gear you need to carry is a small spool with your line, some tippet, and some flies.
The long rod and short light line allow you to create a triangle keeping the majority of your  line off the water so you get a perfect drift with little effort. You can reach over current, guide your fly around obstructions, or guide your fly to drift into the perfect hole.
Having a tight line to your fly gives you the ability to perform fly manipulation techniques with the slightest twitches, allowing you to temp fish to strike your fly when a dead drift does not work well.
There is no reel to mess with! This means line management and less fuss and more enjoying what is around you.
It is quick to learn the basics and fun to learn new ways to present and manipulate your flies.
