<div>I am LaToya ""Mz Toya"" Toussaint. I am an ambitious entrepreneur that is ready to solidify my mark on the beauty industry! I have been a professional Hair Stylist in the Houston area for the last 6 years and was recently awarded a Top Stylist award from Thumbtack! I'm truly blessed to be able to provide for my family from the strength of my very own 2 hands and my ideas. I've had a passion for all things beauty and fashion ever since I can remember. I have been practicing various methods of extensions and importing my own brand of virgin hair extensions as well. My dream is to expand from working from my home into a full servce salon of my very own.<br/>
</div>
<div>I am raising money to help with the start up costs associated with opening my salon. The vision that I have for my salon is a diverse group of individuals that caters to all things beauty. My salon will create more jobs in the community for men and women. With my business plan  each tech that works in my salon will have the ability to earn a decent living and take care of their family comfortably. My salon will be a one stop shop to include natural hair care, extension/weaving services, color services, nail services, makeup/lash services, virgin hair extensions and hair units and I also will be teaming up with a clothing boutique to  offer unique fashions!</div>
<div>This will be the very first establishment of its kind in America. My vision is to create an atmosphere thats relaxing and upscale. Customer Service will be priority while clients unwind in a drama free salon.  Clients will be serviced from the moment they walk in the door. Each and every person that gets serviced in my salon will feel as if my team is especially catering to their every need. Women and men will have access to shop for the latest trends in fashion, shoes, accessories, hair extensions, beauty care products and much more!</div>
<div>The money will go a long way. I can secure a location that is available now in the heart of Houston! Location is key and the space is ready for a salon as the previous tenants had a salon there. I woud use the money to have the space painted. I would also need to purchase salon furniture, equiptment, tools, supplies, use money for rent and utilities and all business related expenses.</div>
<div>The opportunity for the space that is available in the heart of Houston was brought to my attention this past weekend. I must act fast because others are interested as well due to it being in a prime location. My business plan has been written for 2 years now and I'm dedicated and motivated to have my salon open for business in mid January 2016!<br/><br/>Any help and support that is extended to me is greatly appreciated and I am extremely grateful! I plan to document the process of opening my salon on my Facebook page and Periscope to show you exactly how grateful I am and display all of the help that is extended to me.</div>

TTP intercepts food from its supporters such as M&amp;S and Nandos and uses their perfectly edible ingredients to make scrummy meals for the community that they list on a daily 'pay as you feel' board, so customers do exactly that; they pay what they feel it was worth or what they feel they can afford. Further to that, TTP provides training placements through a gateway initiative for vulnerable people to help them learn new skills and ready themselves for full time/part time employment. We work closely with local hostels and referral companies such as Shaw Trust who introduce us to their clients, many of whom have challenging health issues ranging from anxiety/depression, autism, bi-polar and dyspraxia and need a gateway into employment. We provide a place where their service users can come and learn new skills and also somewhere they can eat without cost to them. We help with CV's, we help with job applications and we often all sit together at the end of the lunch shift and eat together as any family would. This is invaluable to many, and even those who have gone on to employment still come back for a shift when they can just to be a part of our family.<br/></p>I would love to take the credit for the 'pay as you feel' concept, but unfortunately, it wasn't my idea. The 'pay as you feel' ethos came from an inspiring individual from Leeds named Adam Smith, who later became the Founder and Director of The Real Junk Food Project. I found his work so inspiring, I started renovating our own space acquired on loan by the hugely supportive P J McGinty's &amp; Sons within just a few months. We're in our sixth week of trade now and we're hitting maximum capacity on our good days; we've gone from strength to strength.

TTP intercepts food from its supporters such as M&S and Nandos and uses their perfectly edible ingredients to make scrummy meals for the community that they list on a daily 'pay as you feel' board, so customers do exactly that; they pay what they feel it was worth or what they feel they can afford. Further to that, TTP provides training placements through a gateway initiative for vulnerable people to help them learn new skills and ready themselves for full time/part time employment. We work closely with local hostels and referral companies such as Shaw Trust who introduce us to their clients, many of whom have challenging health issues ranging from anxiety/depression, autism, bi-polar and dyspraxia and need a gateway into employment. We provide a place where their service users can come and learn new skills and also somewhere they can eat without cost to them. We help with CV's, we help with job applications and we often all sit together at the end of the lunch shift and eat together as any family would. This is invaluable to many, and even those who have gone on to employment still come back for a shift when they can just to be a part of our family.I would love to take the credit for the 'pay as you feel' concept, but unfortunately, it wasn't my idea. The 'pay as you feel' ethos came from an inspiring individual from Leeds named Adam Smith, who later became the Founder and Director of The Real Junk Food Project. I found his work so inspiring, I started renovating our own space acquired on loan by the hugely supportive P J McGinty's & Sons within just a few months. We're in our sixth week of trade now and we're hitting maximum capacity on our good days; we've gone from strength to strength.

part is that development for our new online platform started THIS WEEK!!<br/>We
 still need a few more dollars to help launch the platform in the fall. 
We are just $2,150.00 short of being completely funded. If you have been
 thinking about contributing, now is a great time. Although the time has run out on the indiegogo platform, we've set up a 
donation page on our web site. We appreciate all of your support getting this platform launched. <a href=""http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhourexchange.org%2Findex.php%2Fthe-hour-trader%2Fseedthefuturefundraiser&amp;h=JAQF-LjcN"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://hourexchange.org/index.php/the-hour-trader/seedthefuturefundraiser</a></span></span></span></b></p><p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/></b></p><p><b> 
     The HOUR Exchange is excited to announce that after 15
years in existence, our local currency network has mobilized to move our
directory of goods and services online and into an easily searchable format!</b>

This platform will provide
a multitude of options for making local economics more user-friendly. Instead
of our local directory, which currently exists solely in print form, it will be
online and in real time.
The new website will provide
users with easier modes of communication, and improve awareness of the multitude
of goods and services available locally. Participants will be able to edit
their listings anytime, anywhere, as well as easily browse new posts, wanted
ads, and offers.</p><p>   <b>  This project has potential value beyond our community and region.</b> Many
community currency programs struggle with circulation and diversified resources. Having a strong
network of members that can communicate easily is vital. Once we create a
 successful platform, we hope our model will be able to be used by other 
communities to help expand and facilitate trade within their
local currency networks. <br/></p>
<p>         To
make this project happen, we have outlined our
desired functionality and chosen a professional developer to build a
multi-faceted website platform where people can connect in real time with other
individuals. <span><b>What we are dreaming into</b> <strong>is much more than a static website</strong> <strong>with a searchable directory</strong>, but one that will be <strong>interactive and allow people to easily browse and send messages to other individuals in our community.</strong>
 Imagine the social aspects of facebook combined with the practicality 
of craigslist -- based on community networking and trade. Real time 
posts, sharing, and trades. This platform is also designed with 
programming that will streamline and simplify our volunteer tasks. </span>The initial estimate for funding the project is $6,000.00
to build the site, and we anticipate a bit more for adjustments and
maintenance. We need your help to make this happen.</p>
<p>         
   We welcome contributions at any level, $5, $10, $1,000… If you are
unable to donate monetarily, but would like to contribute time, goods or
services to the fundraising effort, use the ""contact"" link above.</p>
<p> <br/></p><p></p><p>    With Gratitude,</p><p>  <i>For a lasting local currency network in Benton County, Oregon and a brighter future for alternative economies everywhere</i></p><div>

<p><b>     </b>Step aside, Federal Reserve! Our
hometown money is 100% owned and operated by the citizens of Benton County and
our neighboring communities.</p>
<p><b>    </b>In our community we
use HOURS, a locally backed paper currency based on real people and the
goods and services they offer in our network. Local currencies have sprouted up
in communities across the United States as a way to help support small
businesses and entrepreneurs and keep small towns unique. These programs
encourage community building, communication, creativity, kindness, and respect.

</p>
<p>    As of March, 2016, we are entering into our 15<sup>th</sup>
year of service in our community. We are a membership based non-profit
organization which empowers the members of the HOUR Exchange with the ultimate control and oversight of our local
currency. <br/></p>
<p>     Up until now, our primary tools for
networking have been a quarterly print newspaper, the directory of participants,
and marketplace events. This system has worked well, thanks to the dedicated volunteers
who have coordinated these events over these years. When you visit one of
our quarterly marketplace events, you can see that they are thriving with
excitement, yet, the HOUR Trader newspaper is static because print publications become quickly outdated and outmoded.<br/></p>
<p>     As an organization, we’ve heard many
requests over the years for a better online directory. We’ve tried many times to find a way to make it happen. Our Board of Trustees has faced
obstacles: lack of funds, lack of time, and lack of volunteers. In recent months, we have taken the initiative to overcome those challenges and are moving forward with determination! We look forward to expanding our community network in this new direction.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The Concept</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We aim to build an online trading
network, giving people the ability to connect easily and make real time
connections on the web. The site will feature an interactive online directory with
a social networking aspect. You will be able to navigate to see what others are
offering in the community and communicate by simply sending a quick
message. This site will also provide a platform for individuals to build profiles
of goods and services, which can include photos of products and longer written
descriptions. <br/></p>
<p>Building this website is needed to create
a future legacy for our print newsletter, the HOUR Trader.  We are at a point where we must change so that we can stay relevant for years to come. We need to transform fifteen years of print into the digital age. <br/></p>
<p>This project has potential value beyond our community and region. Many
community currency programs struggle with circulation. Having a strong
network of members that can communicate easily is vital. Once we create a successful platform, we hope our model will be used by other communities to help facilitate trade within their
local currency networks. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Campaign Update 5/1/2016The good news is that we are now 50% funded for our project. AND the BEST 
part is that development for our new online platform started THIS WEEK!!We
 still need a few more dollars to help launch the platform in the fall. 
We are just $2,150.00 short of being completely funded. If you have been
 thinking about contributing, now is a great time. Although the time has run out on the indiegogo platform, we've set up a 
donation page on our web site. We appreciate all of your support getting this platform launched. http://hourexchange.org/index.php/the-hour-trader/seedthefuturefundraiser~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
     The HOUR Exchange is excited to announce that after 15
years in existence, our local currency network has mobilized to move our
directory of goods and services online and into an easily searchable format!

This platform will provide
a multitude of options for making local economics more user-friendly. Instead
of our local directory, which currently exists solely in print form, it will be
online and in real time.
The new website will provide
users with easier modes of communication, and improve awareness of the multitude
of goods and services available locally. Participants will be able to edit
their listings anytime, anywhere, as well as easily browse new posts, wanted
ads, and offers.     This project has potential value beyond our community and region. Many
community currency programs struggle with circulation and diversified resources. Having a strong
network of members that can communicate easily is vital. Once we create a
 successful platform, we hope our model will be able to be used by other 
communities to help expand and facilitate trade within their
local currency networks. 
         To
make this project happen, we have outlined our
desired functionality and chosen a professional developer to build a
multi-faceted website platform where people can connect in real time with other
individuals. What we are dreaming into is much more than a static website with a searchable directory, but one that will be interactive and allow people to easily browse and send messages to other individuals in our community.
 Imagine the social aspects of facebook combined with the practicality 
of craigslist -- based on community networking and trade. Real time 
posts, sharing, and trades. This platform is also designed with 
programming that will streamline and simplify our volunteer tasks. The initial estimate for funding the project is $6,000.00
to build the site, and we anticipate a bit more for adjustments and
maintenance. We need your help to make this happen.
         
   We welcome contributions at any level, $5, $10, $1,000… If you are
unable to donate monetarily, but would like to contribute time, goods or
services to the fundraising effort, use the ""contact"" link above.

Per molti di essi è difficile realizzare il proprio sogno e riuscire a serializzare la propria storia a fumetti, perché non possono fare della loro passione un lavoro.  <br/>Il progetto Utopia nasce e si sviluppa dal 2013 ad oggi per dare un'opportunità ad ognuno di questi artisti.</p>

<p><b>Vogliamo appassionare il mondo intero con la nostra Utopia!</b></p>
<p>L'idea per la realizzazione del progetto Utopia si basa sulla voglia costante, che ognuno di noi prova da quando ha iniziato il proprio percorso come fumettista, di rendere il nostro paese un luogo dove chiunque può sviluppare le proprie passioni, crescere con esse e farle diventare il lavoro dei propri sogni.</p>

Hello
everyone. My name is Gaetano, I'm an illustrator, cartoonist and
writer. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462724788/Ritratto_ridmensionato_umv97n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></p>
<p>I would like to present you my project: The Utopia
Project</p>
<p>At first glance it could resemble a common publishing
plan but in reality it isn’t. Utopia is the most ambitious project that I ever
came up with.</p>
<p>The best idea that my imagination could conceive!</p>
<p>The Utopia Project consists in grouping up
cartoonists, writers and illustrators. Together they want to change the
perspective of art and entertainment in Italy, enriching it with comics that
will display always an high quality content, creating what it could be
effectively be called an Utopia!</p>
<p>In Italy there is actually a large number of

Voglio presentarvi il mio progetto: Il Progetto Utopia.Ad una prima occhiata può sembrare un progetto editoriale come tanti ma non lo è.Utopia è il più ambizioso dei progetti che ho creato. La miglior storia che la mia immaginazione potesse concepire!Il progetto Utopia si compone di un collettivo di fumettisti, scrittori e illustratori, uniti per cambiare la realtà dell'arte e dell'intrattenimento in Italia, arricchendola con fumetti dai contenuti sempre nuovi e avvincenti, arrivando a quella che a tutti gli effetti è definibile utopia!Attualmente in Italia, esiste un numero elevato di disegnatori, scrittori, autori di fumetti e illustratori. Per molti di essi è difficile realizzare il proprio sogno e riuscire a serializzare la propria storia a fumetti, perché non possono fare della loro passione un lavoro.  Il progetto Utopia nasce e si sviluppa dal 2013 ad oggi per dare un'opportunità ad ognuno di questi artisti.

Storie avvincenti e sempre nuove
La nostra prima priorità sarà sempre riuscire a far leggere a chiunque le nostre storie, così che tutti le possano apprezzare ed interessarsi. Ecco i link per leggere le preview di alcune di esse, presto saranno disponibili sul sito ufficiale (attualmente in costruzione).

A cosa sono destinati i fondiPer realizzare il progetto Utopia e la casa editrice che ne deriverà, Upper Comics, sono necessari dei fondi.
L'obiettivo a cui puntiamo è di 19mila euro, questa somma servirà per sostenere il lavoro degli autori che hanno creduto nel progetto e hanno messo a disposizione le loro storie basandosi sulla loro fiducia nei miei confronti. Servirà per sostenere il loro spirito creativo e la loro voglia di mettersi in gioco! La restante parte dei ricavati servirà per produrre e distribuire i perk per ringraziarvi, per le spedizioni e le tasse.

Vogliamo ringraziarvi per il supporto che ci darete!Per ringraziarvi della vostra infinita generosità e per valorizzare la vostra volontà di cambiare le situazione artistica del nostro paese, abbiamo creato una serie di perk, o come li chiamiamo noi, ringraziamenti. I nostri ringraziamenti variano dalle copie cartacee di alcuni del primo volume di Almost Dead, alle magliette, statuine 2D, Plush Doll e disegni personalizzati!
Lista dei PerkDi seguito trovate la lista completa dei perk.



(La spedizione dei perk verrà effettuata da Dicembre 2016 a Gennaio 2017)
Donare inoltre può essere anche un buon modo per risparmiare, con la donazione infatti vi sarà possibile ricevere i nostri perk a prezzo ridotto e compresi di altri gadget esclusivi in omaggio!
Se non dovessimo raggiungere l'obiettivo prefissato dalla campagna, i fondi raccolti saranno comunque usati per finanziare e sostenere gli autori coinvolti e per la creazione dei perk per chi avrà donato.

Il nostro obiettivo
Utopia è un progetto ambizioso, lo sappiamo, ma anche per questo è importante riuscire a renderlo reale.Grazie ad esso contribuirete allo sviluppo di più di 10 storie a fumetti inedite, ognuna delle quali potrà coinvolgervi emotivamente ed appassionarvi.
Nel contempo riuscirete a finanziare gli artisti coinvolti ed il nostro sogno, rendendovi anche voi partecipi della creazione e lo sviluppo delle nostre storie, della nascita della nostra Utopia!Il nostro obiettivo è la divulgazione, in Italia e nel mondo, del più alto numero possibile di storie a fumetti, tutte diverse tra loro, per stile di disegno e scrittura, sempre nuove e mai banali, che possano coinvolgere il pubblico e trasportarlo in nuovi universi narrativi. Il nostro scopo è pubblicare mensilmente dieci storie a fumetti, e tramite un piccolo abbonamento mensile far si che chiunque possa leggere le nostre serializzazioni ovunque si trovi.
Vogliamo appassionare il mondo intero con la nostra Utopia!
L'idea per la realizzazione del progetto Utopia si basa sulla voglia costante, che ognuno di noi prova da quando ha iniziato il proprio percorso come fumettista, di rendere il nostro paese un luogo dove chiunque può sviluppare le proprie passioni, crescere con esse e farle diventare il lavoro dei propri sogni.





Vogliamo dimostrare al mondo intero che i nostri autori, e le loro storie a fumetti, non hanno nulla da invidiare al resto del mondo, che la nostra Utopia è possibile, basta solo appassionare chi legge. Questo è un obiettivo che raggiungeremo con la pubblicazione mensile delle nostre storie, che sarà disponibile con un piccolo pagamento mensile da inizio 2017 nella nostra piattaforma di e-commerce.Come puoi aiutarci?
Donare non è necessariamente l'unica forma di aiuto che potete offrirci, potete infatti condividere la nostra causa tramite i social network Facebook e Twitter, usando il nostro hashtag ufficiale #utopiaunited o semplicemente inviando un'e-mail ai vostri amici.Le possibilità sono infinite, sta a voi scegliere come aiutarci a far diventare reale, la nostra Utopia!

What is the Utopia project

Hello
everyone. My name is Gaetano, I'm an illustrator, cartoonist and
writer. 

I would like to present you my project: The Utopia
Project
At first glance it could resemble a common publishing
plan but in reality it isn’t. Utopia is the most ambitious project that I ever
came up with.
The best idea that my imagination could conceive!
The Utopia Project consists in grouping up
cartoonists, writers and illustrators. Together they want to change the
perspective of art and entertainment in Italy, enriching it with comics that
will display always an high quality content, creating what it could be
effectively be called an Utopia!
In Italy there is actually a large number of
designers, writers, cartoonists and illustrators. It’s hard for most of them to
accomplish their dreams publishing and serializing their own comics because of
how comics and their culture is seen in Italy, preventing them to use their
passion as a job and business.
The Utopia Project was born in 2013 to give an
opportunity to each one of these artists.


Exciting and always new comics!
Our first priority is, and always will be, to make our
comics easily affordable by anyone so that everyone can appreciate them and
will  be interested in them.
Here are the links to read some previews, soon they
will be available also on the official website (currently under construction).

<h3>Seedling is <u>clean</u> &amp; <u>efficient</u> locally grown food.</h3>
<p>We are a six part business that is dedicated to the triple bottom line or <strong>People</strong>, <strong>Planet</strong>, and <strong>Profit</strong>. We will meet the demands of local farm-to-table in the urban setting of Philadelphia, providing the freshest produce and market-ready fish to our customers <u>every week of the year</u>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479274927/bullczgekiz4xl7r6p4z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>1. <a href=""http://www.seedling-phl.com/aquaculture.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aquaculture</a><br/>In times when our oceans are polluted with as much plastic as our landfills, and mercury and contaminate levels in waterways are unpredictable, Seedling takes the approach of growing market-ready fish in controlled atmospheres. Feeding our fish the highest quality organic feed, we enable them to enrich the water with nutrients that are then passed along in our hydroponic system to our plants in a process called ""aquaponics"".</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479275256/vh60okote355zcgsaoyh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>2. <a href=""http://www.seedling-phl.com/produce.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Produce</a></p>
<p>Building off of the synergies of aquaponics, which utilize the nutrient enriched water from the aquaculture process in hydroponic vertical farming, reducing the need for fertilizers, and eliminating the need for pesticides and herbicides. This combination enables the Seedling system to scale beyond the capacity of traditional soil-based agriculture.</p>
<p>Seedling will grow nearly 20 acres of indoor hydroponic produce regardless of drought, flood, frost, or snow...365 days a year, in the heart of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Seedling’s restaurant and grocery customers will be enrolled in hosted compost efforts. This responsible sorting of biological waste will be collected on regular intervals, providing Seedling with anaerobic digester fill. The anaerobic digestion will provide fuel for Seedling’s on-site power generation as well as nutrient-rich digestive which can be used internally or sold to local farmers as fertilizer.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479276315/mxkifcqywfsbtpzgzlra.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>4. <a href=""http://www.seedling-phl.com/energy.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tri-Generation Energy</a><br/>Seedling’s on-site power generation is provided by a tri-generation molten carbonate fuel cell. This fuel cell converts biogas (methane) from our digester into heat, electricity, and purified hydrogen (H₂). Pioneered in California’s wastewater treatment centers, this tri-generation technology will provide electricity at a greater efficiency than the local electrical utility, heat for steam methane reforming, and purified H₂ fuel, enabling localized fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) fueling.</p>

Additional H₂ sales will be sought through partnerships with the City of Philadelphia, fuel cell electric vehicle producers, local delivery services, and an emerging consumer market.</p>

By managing the various stages of water from contaminated to clean to nutrient enriched, Seedling will optimize the function while reducing the demand of water within the system. This process of water recycling both conserves water and eliminated harmful environmental conditions commonly associated with runoff from field irrigation.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.seedling-phl.com/contact.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Community</a><br/>Providing a venue for consumers and potential customers to sample the produce and aquaculture will strengthen consumer confidence.

<h3>Who's Bright Idea Was This??</h3>
<p>The founder of Seedling, Travis Andren, is an award winning Industrial Designer &amp; Environmentalist who is passionate about local, healthy food. Seedling is a culmination of graduate work in Environmental Policy and experience in designing engines and energy systems to address global energy concerns. Always keeping close company with the food industry, the inherent synergies between waste and fuel became apparent, and only required the emergence of technology to be proven before Seedling was conceived.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Building a Foundation</h3>
<p>The Seedling system is sized to fit the tri-generation energy output (2.3MW) and requires significant up-front capital costs. Seedling is seeking an operating capital of $300,000 which will enable us to achieve our many licensing requirements as well as applying for grants in agriculture, energy, alternative fuels, and water conservation. We strive for a new tower construction, to optimize efficiencies, however we are also considering alternatives to new construction, which may lower the initial capital, but may also reduce efficiencies.</p>
<p><u>We need to achieve a minimum goal of $150,000 to continue operations.</u> <strong>If we do not reach this minimum goal, we will fulfill the orders for tangible incentives </strong>(shirts, bottles, bags)<strong>, and return the contributions for the intangible incentives </strong>(CSA shares, hosted plots)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>This is our respectful commitment to our supporters. To thank you for your contributions, we are also recognition through charitable donations.</p>
<p><strong>Each incentive carries with it a ""charitable membership"" recognition. Seedling will donate 10 percent of our profits annually to five non-profits, in the name of our founding supporters who provided us with our first 10 percent of capital. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We are providing 1-year charity selection as an <i>additional </i>""perk"", this is a $100,000 commitment that may yield in excess of $400,000 toward a nonprofit donation after our first fully operational year. That's A LOT OF GOOD for a charity of your choosing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For our ""Charitable Investors"", we provide the privileged of selecting the non-profit organizations who will receive our donations for the first three years that Seedling is profitable.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Positive Impact!</h3>
<p>Seedling's inherent efficiencies enable us to mitigate the variable cost of externalities, while providing clean and healthy food in an ever changing climate with a fractional impact to the environment compared to imports, traditional field farming, or even our competitive vertical farmers.</p>
<p>Our ability to deliver with fuel cell vehicles which emit only pure water, reduces CO2 emissions in an already congested city. Our hydrogen production will be enough to fill 300 cars/day, furthering these benefits by providing the first hydrogen fueling station in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Through our anaerobic collection, we will reclaim methane that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere as one of the worst greenhouse gases.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Complexities.</h3>
<p>Navigating the synergies in this system is complex work, and will require a number of strategic partnerships going forward. We will strive to form deep roots within the community, working with the city to help bring clean transportation, agriculture, and power generation into one synchronized location.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Together We Can Help This SEEDLING Grow!</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone who can support us can do so financially. We also know that the City of Neighborhoods is a close-knit community who values and respects the knowledge and experience of those around us. We simply ask you to start a conversation with your friends, family, and neighbors...</p>

</div></div>","Seedling is clean & efficient locally grown food.
We are a six part business that is dedicated to the triple bottom line or People, Planet, and Profit. We will meet the demands of local farm-to-table in the urban setting of Philadelphia, providing the freshest produce and market-ready fish to our customers every week of the year.
1. AquacultureIn times when our oceans are polluted with as much plastic as our landfills, and mercury and contaminate levels in waterways are unpredictable, Seedling takes the approach of growing market-ready fish in controlled atmospheres. Feeding our fish the highest quality organic feed, we enable them to enrich the water with nutrients that are then passed along in our hydroponic system to our plants in a process called ""aquaponics"".
2. Produce
Building off of the synergies of aquaponics, which utilize the nutrient enriched water from the aquaculture process in hydroponic vertical farming, reducing the need for fertilizers, and eliminating the need for pesticides and herbicides. This combination enables the Seedling system to scale beyond the capacity of traditional soil-based agriculture.
Seedling will grow nearly 20 acres of indoor hydroponic produce regardless of drought, flood, frost, or snow...365 days a year, in the heart of Philadelphia.
3. Anaerobic Digestion
Seedling’s restaurant and grocery customers will be enrolled in hosted compost efforts. This responsible sorting of biological waste will be collected on regular intervals, providing Seedling with anaerobic digester fill. The anaerobic digestion will provide fuel for Seedling’s on-site power generation as well as nutrient-rich digestive which can be used internally or sold to local farmers as fertilizer.
4. Tri-Generation EnergySeedling’s on-site power generation is provided by a tri-generation molten carbonate fuel cell. This fuel cell converts biogas (methane) from our digester into heat, electricity, and purified hydrogen (H₂). Pioneered in California’s wastewater treatment centers, this tri-generation technology will provide electricity at a greater efficiency than the local electrical utility, heat for steam methane reforming, and purified H₂ fuel, enabling localized fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) fueling.
5. HydrogenSeedling will offer localized delivery/collection services for our customers. This enables the freshest produce and aquaculture to be delivered the same day as processing. This delivery will be enabled by on-site H₂ generation, enabling FCEV delivery methods and mitigating deliver costs and environmental impacts. Additional H₂ sales will be sought through partnerships with the City of Philadelphia, fuel cell electric vehicle producers, local delivery services, and an emerging consumer market.
6. WaterIntegral to the aquaculture, vertical farming, and digestion is water management. By managing the various stages of water from contaminated to clean to nutrient enriched, Seedling will optimize the function while reducing the demand of water within the system. This process of water recycling both conserves water and eliminated harmful environmental conditions commonly associated with runoff from field irrigation.
CommunityProviding a venue for consumers and potential customers to sample the produce and aquaculture will strengthen consumer confidence. Seedling will partner with a top Philadelphia chef to host a restaurant at the Seedling complex, offering an approachable, elegant dining experience along with an opportunity to educate and impress guests and customers.

<div>It all started with a surfer, a hiker, and a mountain man that came together at a coffee shop in Newport Beach, California. We all had a passion for the food that drives our outdoor adventures. Whether it was surfing in Newport, hiking in Yosemite, backpacking through Utah, or just getting through an 8 hour work day, we arrived at two conclusions. Either the food we used didn't have enough energy to get us through our adventures, or the food that did have the energy was way too pricey. So we decided to make our own. Using a mixture of family recipes passed down from generations and new recipes we have infused with a modern flare, we have made our line of All Natural Trail Grub.</div>

I was considering what to do when a good friend mentioned my love and passion for baking. And thus the dream began. I have always loved to bake since I was a child and I would always whip something up for my friends and family whenever possible. I have the creative gene and had gotten my degree in Interior Design but it wasn't the right fit for me. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457913466/bxn5wdzma9px8rc58yyt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>So I started Cherry on Top Delights, I had wonderful family and friends that ordered their sweet treats from me and every cake I made helped me increase my skill level. I am mainly self taught, trial and error but I have also taken cake classes online, took Wilton's classes, attended Chattahoochee Technical College for culinary, Spent a week in Chicago at the French Pastry School, attended Cake Carnival in Canada in 2013 &amp; 2015. I then started teaching Wilton's classes at Michael's Craft Store, as well as teaching Cakery Club after school program at the local elementary school, in my home and even having a summer camp for kids. I teach birthday parties and for Girls Night In etc.</p>

I was considering what to do when a good friend mentioned my love and passion for baking. And thus the dream began. I have always loved to bake since I was a child and I would always whip something up for my friends and family whenever possible. I have the creative gene and had gotten my degree in Interior Design but it wasn't the right fit for me. 



So I started Cherry on Top Delights, I had wonderful family and friends that ordered their sweet treats from me and every cake I made helped me increase my skill level. I am mainly self taught, trial and error but I have also taken cake classes online, took Wilton's classes, attended Chattahoochee Technical College for culinary, Spent a week in Chicago at the French Pastry School, attended Cake Carnival in Canada in 2013 & 2015. I then started teaching Wilton's classes at Michael's Craft Store, as well as teaching Cakery Club after school program at the local elementary school, in my home and even having a summer camp for kids. I teach birthday parties and for Girls Night In etc.



Cherry on Top specializes in custom cakes, cupcakes, cake pops and cookies. But also offering an assortment of additional desserts for purchase such as pies, breads, chocolates, etc. We offer delivery for an additional charge depending on location Monday-Sunday. All dessert are hand created made from scratch using only the freshest ingredients and baked without using  preservatives. We can also accommodate allergy requests. Our new shop will have a space that will offer camps, parties, baking and decorating classes. We will have retail pickup and wholesale offerings. So stop in for a treat and a coffee we'd love to see you!



I have a Cottage Foods license that allows me to bake out of my house, but the business has grown and grown and is continuing to grow. I now have 2 employees that help in the bakery 5 days a week. But my bakery is in my home and we have overgrown the space, we have no room, we are on top of each other and my family , home and sanity need a new space so I can have a separation of home & work!! 



I am starting this campaign so I can open my retail shop, I love what I do, I have grown so much in 3 years and I cannot wait to see what the next chapter holds. I won't lie opening a space is very expensive! I have found a space in Marietta (East Cobb) and I need to get it up to code, purchase equipment and inventory, etc. (see next section).


   What we need and What you will get! Regardless of how much I raise I will find a way to raise the money I need. The amount I decided to ask for will allow me a good start at helping pay my lease so I can focus on updating the space, getting everything I need up to code as well as purchasing my equipment and inventory. 
Monthly expenses $9,000, Opening Start-up Costs $30-40,000. I am hoping to raise enough to help me with 2 months of operating expenses. 
But you get things in return for helping me out!!

   The Impact I love this business, it's back breaking and I don't sleep much but we get to bring enjoyment to people on days that create lifetime memories. I have been in business for 3 years, I work night and day and I want to continue to grow and create a place where people can create new memories, teach the younger generation how to take ingredients and make something that brings happiness. A place to call my own, a happy place that brings people together. 
    Risks & Challenges I am not a person that takes no for an answer, I look on the positive side of life and I will work day and night to make the shop grow just as I do now. There are always challenges in any risk you take. But now is the time to take that risk and the first challenge is to get this space up and running!

WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH CURRENT SIRENS?


Every year there are over 5,000 serious injuries and around 550 fatalities involving emergency vehicles and ordinary motorists. Our research shows that many accidents occur because the current sirens were not heard properly or caused the drivers to panic.

(Warning!  The following  graphics contains scenes of vehicle accidents which some people might find disturbing)



This is what can happen. 
The electronic siren is on the roof of the fire truck.



(Warning! This video contains scenes of vehicle accidents)
The emergency vehicle drivers could do nothing to prevent these collisions.IN THESE CRASHES THE SIRENS DID NOT GIVE ADEQUATE WARNING


FIREFIGHTERS RESCUING A MAN TRAPPED BY FIRE



IMAGINE IF THE RESCUE LADDER WAS DELAYED BY TRAFFIC FOR JUST 30 SECONDS - THE OUTCOME WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT

____________________________________________________________________
DIRECTIONAL SIRENS WILL HELP FIRE TRUCKS ARRIVE AT EMERGENCIES QUICKLY
DIRECTIONAL SIRENS WILL PREVENT CRASHES AND SAVE LIVES

___________________________________________________________________


WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN with 'YELP' and 'WAIL' SIRENS?This is one of the problems -
This is why motorists everywhere are confused and can't tell the direction of approaching emergency vehicles. The sounds made by yelp and wail sirens are so disorientating that people tend to freeze or panic.            WHY ARE QUADRASONIC DIRECTIONAL SIRENS BETTER?This is how they work -

___________________________________________________________________


THE DISTINCTIVE VIBRATO 'WALL OF SOUND' AND 'DOPPLER' EFFECTS produced by our Directional Siren System, enables motorists to easily detect the speed and direction of approaching emergency vehices, just by listening to the siren sounds.

TESTIMONIALS    



""Having discussed your research and development into directional vehicle
sirens, I must reiterate my support for this work.


Having been in a position to see the result of incidents where emergency
vehicles have had occurrences (minor and major) which resulted in injury and
death on the road, any advance in technology that would assist and improve the
pre-alerting of road users must be a benefit.
The airport fire and rescue service would also benefit from this
technology as responding to emergencies in low visibility causes problems for
those awaiting our response""
Watch Commander - Airport Firefighting & Rescue Service

___________________________________________________________________

""One issue of concern to many fire officers and the general public would appear to be that with the yelp and wail sirens it is extremely difficult to detect where the sound is coming from""Mr Brandon demonstrated directional sound signals he has developed and it would appear that the use of directional sirens could reduce accidents and potentially reduce fatalities and injuries""The Fire Service could benefit from reduced driver stress and cost savings from a reduction in the number of vehicles being off the road due to accidents"" Operational Equipment Team Manager - Fire & Rescue Service

SATURDAY 16 JULY (10am - 10pm)
Bath Carnival is a non-profit organisation. Our free city-wide community project supports the arts throughout B&NES and the South West. 

PROCESSION
For the last three years we've welcomed thousands of people onto the streets of Bath to enjoy a vibrant annual Carnival procession. The procession starts from Great Pulteney Street, brings a party atmosphere throughout the city centre and climaxes with the grand finale in Kingston Parade.

PARTY IN THE GARDENS
We also host the city's largest outdoor community party in Sydney Gardens, with food and drink as well as live music and entertainment throughout the day and into the evening. The family friendly event has a large space dedicated to children's activities and a workshop area for all ages to enjoy.

We've always kept our event completely FREE to the public, and will continue to do so in 2016.

<div><br/></div>
<div>Welcome, and thanks for looking! Sweet Peaz Diaper Service is owned  by Jessica Trunk of Portage, Indiana with the help of her husband, Ryan. Together, they are looking to expand to a laundromat location in East Chicago, Indiana. </div>
<div>This opportunity came suddenly, but that isn't stopping us! The owners of the laundromat are willing to work with us to an extent, but unfortunately the banks are not. They just don't see it like we do: a capital gain by taking over an already functioning laundromat.</div>
<div>We are excited for this opportunity, it'll help grow the diaper service by bounds and leaps - all while helping Ryan finally get out of the trucking industry and be home with his family instead of spending 14 hours a day on the road, and the rest of it sleeping. There just isn't enough time in the day sometimes.</div> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Whew. 100k? Seems like a lot, doesn't it? The asking price for the laundromat is $99, 900. This is for an already existing business, PLUS an attached house for rent. While some of the equipment needs to be replaced, the business is still in operation and drawing in funds.</div>
<div>We just need help buying it. So, all of our funds raised will be going toward the purchase of the building. Either in full, or offering a large lump sum for a temporary rental agreement. We would prefer the former option, but we'll take what we can get.</div>
<div>Perks, perks! Here's where it gets fun for you! Everyone gets a little something for their help. </div>
<div>$1: Thanks so much! Every penny helps! We'll be putting your name on our wall of donors in a pretty bronze color.</div>
<div>$5 Perk: We'll be sending you a thank you card in the mail! Once the campaign completes, we will get your address and get you a card in the mail. :) Your name gets to be in silver!</div>
<div>$10 Perk: You get the previous perks, plus a special spot on our wall where we plan to put the names of all our donors! Plus, it'll be on gold!</div>
<div>$20 Perk: Locals, you get some free washes at the laundromat! That includes the big stuff like comforters! We all know those can't go in our tiny home washers. You also get the previous perks as well, with your name bolded and in red!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Of course, if we don't reach our goal, questions are raised. First, all funds are going to be deposited into a bank account to sit there. They won't be used except for the explicit purpose of this laundromat. Even if that means they sit for a while. Most perks will begin going out at this time, but may take a little while once we get everything together.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>By donating, you'll be helping our family achieve our dream of fully owning our own business. We already have our diaper service, which is thriving, but in need of expansion. Owning this laundromat will assist us in growing the service, as well as having the laundromat for income. My husband will finally be able to leave the trucking industry within a year and spend more time with his family.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Growing the diaper service means us helping reduce landfill growth by decreasing the amount of disposable diapers entering them. This is good not only for our business, but for our earth. Did you know it can take 500 years for ONE disposable diaper to break down? One less in the landfill is one less! We will also be able to provide more services on a commercial scale, such as laundering personal cloth diapers instead of just the ones we rent out.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Truthfully, our biggest problem is coming up with the funding for this project. But the bonus is that we will be combining two already profiting businesses into one joint venture. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Can't donate? That's okay! Sharing is caring, as they say! Please make sure to use IndieGoGo's sharing tools to share this to local social media. Use hashtags like #sweetpeazds to help spread the word!</p>

This opportunity came suddenly, but that isn't stopping us! The owners of the laundromat are willing to work with us to an extent, but unfortunately the banks are not. They just don't see it like we do: a capital gain by taking over an already functioning laundromat.
We are excited for this opportunity, it'll help grow the diaper service by bounds and leaps - all while helping Ryan finally get out of the trucking industry and be home with his family instead of spending 14 hours a day on the road, and the rest of it sleeping. There just isn't enough time in the day sometimes.    What We Need & What You Get

Whew. 100k? Seems like a lot, doesn't it? The asking price for the laundromat is $99, 900. This is for an already existing business, PLUS an attached house for rent. While some of the equipment needs to be replaced, the business is still in operation and drawing in funds.
We just need help buying it. So, all of our funds raised will be going toward the purchase of the building. Either in full, or offering a large lump sum for a temporary rental agreement. We would prefer the former option, but we'll take what we can get.
Perks, perks! Here's where it gets fun for you! Everyone gets a little something for their help. 
$1: Thanks so much! Every penny helps! We'll be putting your name on our wall of donors in a pretty bronze color.
$5 Perk: We'll be sending you a thank you card in the mail! Once the campaign completes, we will get your address and get you a card in the mail. :) Your name gets to be in silver!
$10 Perk: You get the previous perks, plus a special spot on our wall where we plan to put the names of all our donors! Plus, it'll be on gold!
$20 Perk: Locals, you get some free washes at the laundromat! That includes the big stuff like comforters! We all know those can't go in our tiny home washers. You also get the previous perks as well, with your name bolded and in red!

Of course, if we don't reach our goal, questions are raised. First, all funds are going to be deposited into a bank account to sit there. They won't be used except for the explicit purpose of this laundromat. Even if that means they sit for a while. Most perks will begin going out at this time, but may take a little while once we get everything together.

    The Impact

By donating, you'll be helping our family achieve our dream of fully owning our own business. We already have our diaper service, which is thriving, but in need of expansion. Owning this laundromat will assist us in growing the service, as well as having the laundromat for income. My husband will finally be able to leave the trucking industry within a year and spend more time with his family.

Growing the diaper service means us helping reduce landfill growth by decreasing the amount of disposable diapers entering them. This is good not only for our business, but for our earth. Did you know it can take 500 years for ONE disposable diaper to break down? One less in the landfill is one less! We will also be able to provide more services on a commercial scale, such as laundering personal cloth diapers instead of just the ones we rent out.

    Risks & Challenges Truthfully, our biggest problem is coming up with the funding for this project. But the bonus is that we will be combining two already profiting businesses into one joint venture. 

    Other Ways You Can Help Can't donate? That's okay! Sharing is caring, as they say! Please make sure to use IndieGoGo's sharing tools to share this to local social media. Use hashtags like #sweetpeazds to help spread the word!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>HELP SPREADING - GET SOMETHING. </b>With articles and topics that are relevant
internationally, it’s useful to translate them into different languages. That’s
why every user has the option to translate articles, even the ones from other
users. This way, trans-national communities can be build up in a natural
manner. Additionally, experiences can be shared that otherwise never could go
public, just because the authors couldn’t write them down in English. For
translating articles, it is also possible to make money from advertisements.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span></span></p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>To maintain our independence besides generous donations, we came to allow advertisements on our page. There will be different types of advertising surfaces. The surfaces will be separated in both local and national advertisements. The local ones will be published from merchants in your region. It's going to be cheap, so even smaller businesses will be able to afford them.</p>
<p>Merchants can directly reach their target group. This way the local retail structure is reinforced. The ads will be stationary, but not personalized. We won't track any of your points of interests and won't give any personal data to our advertisers.</p>
<p>Of course watching the advertisements will be voluntary. Your adblocker will keep your page free from any ads. For all of you who are not interested in advertisements but still want to support their favourite authors or the page, there will be the opportunity to donate smaller or bigger sums.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span></span></p>

<br/><p></p>
<strong>YOUR CONTENT. YOUR PROFIT. </strong>We believe, you as users (authors, journalists, bloggers, writers, …) also have a right on the advertising revenues. That’s why every verified author gets 50% of the local advertising revenue on his articles. From your first viewer, we will collect your money and pay it to you starting from 10€.

<div>After almost three years of work the beta-version is already finished. A lot of awesome functions are already working. But the page is not ready yet. We have to finish some modules that are left to go, close security gaps and give the page a graphical make over. No matter how big this campaigns impact will be – we will continue working on this project. You decide on how fast we can reach our goals and how many people can work together on it. We also have to buy bigger server capacities and distribute servers in different countries to save your data. Furthermore, we want to save data on mirror servers, so possibly critical content can’t be prohibited in countries.<span><br/></span>

<p>Um neben den Spenden und freiwilligen
Beiträgen weiterhin selbstständig und unabhängig zu sein, haben wir uns dazu
entschieden, Werbung zu erlauben. Es wird verschiedene Werbeflächen geben.
Aufgeteilt werden die Werbeflächen in lokale und überregionale Werbung. Die
Lokalwerbung wird von Händlern aus eurer Umgebung geschaltet. Die Werbeflächen
sind günstig, sodass auch kleine Geschäfte ihren Bekanntheitsgrad vergrößern
können.</p>
<p>Die Händler können sich direkt an die richtige Zielgruppe richten.
Nebenbei werden so lokale Einzelhandelsstrukturen gestärkt. Die Werbung wird
also standortgebunden sein, ansonsten aber nicht personalisiert. Wir tracken
eure Interessensgebiete nicht und geben auch sonst keine Daten an Werbetreibende
weiter. </p>
<p>Natürlich bleibt das Anschauen der Werbung freiwillig. Eure Adblocker
verhindern jede Art der Werbung auf unserer Seite zuverlässig. Für all jene,
die keine Lust auf Werbung haben, die Seite und die Autoren aber trotzdem
unterstützen möchten, wird es weiterhin die Möglichkeit geben, kleinere und
größere Beträge zielgerichtet zu spenden.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span></span></p>

</div>
<p><b>EUER CONTENT. EURE EINNAHMEN.</b>Wir sind der Meinung, dass ihr als User ebenfalls ein Recht
auf einen Teil der Werbeeinnahmen habt. Schließlich ist es euer Content, über
den wir unsere laufenden Kosten decken müssen. Deshalb erhält jeder verifizierte
Autor 50% der Einnahmen, die über die Lokalwerbung aus seinen Artikeln
eingenommen werden. Die Einnahmen werden ab dem ersten Viewer von uns für euch gesammelt
und ab einem Betrag von 10€ ausgezahlt. Von den Einnahmen der etwas teureren,
überregionalen Werbung werden Projekte und Autoren in Krisengebieten
unterstützt, in denen keine lokale Werbung geschaltet werden kann und die sonst
keine Möglichkeit sehen, ihre Arbeit aufrecht zu erhalten.</p>

<h2><b>Wo ihr ins Spiel kommt…</b></h2>
<div>Nach nunmehr drei Jahren intensiver Arbeit steht die
Beta-Version der Seite. Viele spannende Funktionen sind bereits implementiert.
Eure Unterstützung wird uns dabei helfen, die fehlenden Module fertig zu
stellen, Sicherheitslücken zu schließen und die Plattform grafisch zu
überarbeiten.<br/>
</div>
<p>Unabhängig von der Höhe der Einnahmen durch das Crowdfunding
werden wir weiter an dem Projekt arbeiten. Ihr entscheidet mit euren Spenden
darüber, wie schnell wir weiterkommen und wie viele Menschen an diesem Projekt
arbeiten können.</p>
<p>Hinzu kommen die enormen Serverauslastungen bei einem solchen
Großprojekt. Wir möchten nach dem offiziellen Start mehrere Server weltweit
verteilt unterhalten, um euch eine hohe Geschwindigkeit und angenehmer
Nutzererfahrung bieten zu können. Die Verteilung der Server auf verschiedene
Länder hat darüber hinaus die Funktion die Sicherung eurer Daten
sicherzustellen. Außerdem sollen die Daten gespiegelt werden, um eine mögliche
Sperrung kritischer Inhalte in Ländern ohne Pressefreiheit zu verhindern.</p>

<b>Andere
Wege der Unterstützung </b><br/>

<p>Auch mit allem Geld der Welt würde uns das Wichtigste
fehlen: Du! Wenn Ihr also aktiv am Entwicklungsprozess teilhaben möchtet, besucht uns auf facebook oder meldet euch bei uns unter <a href=""mailto:info@united-world.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>info@united-world.org</b></a> und werdet
Teil der Community, bereits vor dem offiziellen Start! Dabei bieten wir euch
natürlich die Möglichkeit, bereits Beiträge zu verfassen und unsere neuen
Funktionen zu testen und Eure ersten Beiträge zu veröffentlichen!</p>
<p>Außerdem hilfst du uns natürlich enorm, wenn du unsere Kampagne
verbreitest, oder von unserer Idee deinen Freunden und Familie erzählst. Wenn
du also gerade finanziell nicht in der Lage bist, uns zu unterstützen, dir
unsere Idee aber trotzdem gut gefällt, so kannst du trotzdem ein wichtiger Teil
unseres Projekts werden und in Zukunft davon profitieren.</p>

</div></div>","A SOCIAL MEDIA HYBRID. Three years ago we started to bring our idea to life: revolutionizing news and the way news reach the audience. We want to create a place where everybody can say whatever they want, free and independent from political censorship, commercial interests and without range limitation.

OUR NETWORK. YOUR POSSIBILITIES.United-world.org is not meant to be another social media network, but a way of living democracy.
It could become a platform where we answer future questions, reflect our present
and learn together from the past.FREEDOM OF SPEECH – WORLDWIDE. Our network is going to enable every human being to make use of his or her right of freedom of speech, regardless of gender, origin or social status. That’s essential for a self-determined society. Everybody’s concerns should relish boundless outrange. To our mind, that’s basic to democracy.


SAVE JOURNALISM. Sometimes it happens, that journalists get arrested after publishing political challenging news. What’s happening then is that all the media hype is about the political persecution and the article itself gets lost. We save the messages, that lead to this.A BARRIER TO THE SOCIAL MEDIA NEWS FLOOD. Many people feel disadvantaged considering the one-sided journalism most mainstream media spread. It is difficult to identify what a nations populations real interests are.



YOU ARE THE VOICE. Our users are reader and author at the same time. Your content will be categorized, regional bundled and will get the opportunity to be spreaded worldwide.

NO ALGORITHMS - YOU DECIDE. Preselected news by established social media networks tire many people.
With our innovate rating system, our community will decide which news are
important and should reach a higher level of visibility.


REGIONAL NEWS, SPREADED WORLDWIDE. Stories, that concern you and your
surroundings. News that are written by people from the point of incident.
That’s how united-world.org connects social networking with news portals.

PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE. Users can inform themselves purposeful and sustainable. News will be sorted by topic and saved in one of 7 million places. Further, news will get a time mark, to avoid that articles will be published again and again, like it’s happening everywhere right now in social media.


THE DISLIKE BUTTON - DISCUSSING SOLUTIONS. We’ll give you the tools to make news real, to discuss them further than just liking or disliking them. That way, we can start finding solutions together.
WHO‘S YOUR FAVOURITE.  Of course you will be able to mark authors and articles, so you can get to them later and be kept up to date for all changes.
NO WIFI? NO PROBLEM! Messages can be uploaded spontaneously via text message. That way, you can be connected with others in seconds and are always informed about current events and gatherings.
 

HELP SPREADING - GET SOMETHING. With articles and topics that are relevant
internationally, it’s useful to translate them into different languages. That’s
why every user has the option to translate articles, even the ones from other
users. This way, trans-national communities can be build up in a natural
manner. Additionally, experiences can be shared that otherwise never could go
public, just because the authors couldn’t write them down in English. For
translating articles, it is also possible to make money from advertisements.


To maintain our independence besides generous donations, we came to allow advertisements on our page. There will be different types of advertising surfaces. The surfaces will be separated in both local and national advertisements. The local ones will be published from merchants in your region. It's going to be cheap, so even smaller businesses will be able to afford them.
Merchants can directly reach their target group. This way the local retail structure is reinforced. The ads will be stationary, but not personalized. We won't track any of your points of interests and won't give any personal data to our advertisers.
Of course watching the advertisements will be voluntary. Your adblocker will keep your page free from any ads. For all of you who are not interested in advertisements but still want to support their favourite authors or the page, there will be the opportunity to donate smaller or bigger sums.


YOUR CONTENT. YOUR PROFIT. We believe, you as users (authors, journalists, bloggers, writers, …) also have a right on the advertising revenues. That’s why every verified author gets 50% of the local advertising revenue on his articles. From your first viewer, we will collect your money and pay it to you starting from 10€. The national and international advertisement revenues will be used for projects and authors from conflict areas or other regions, that don’t have any ads and who wouldn’t be able to keep their work up otherwise.  


WHERE YOU COME IN…
After almost three years of work the beta-version is already finished. A lot of awesome functions are already working. But the page is not ready yet. We have to finish some modules that are left to go, close security gaps and give the page a graphical make over. No matter how big this campaigns impact will be – we will continue working on this project. You decide on how fast we can reach our goals and how many people can work together on it. We also have to buy bigger server capacities and distribute servers in different countries to save your data. Furthermore, we want to save data on mirror servers, so possibly critical content can’t be prohibited in countries.


OTHER WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE
Even with all the money on this planet, the most Important
thing would be missing: You. Subscribe with your e-mail-adress or keep up with
us via facebook. Get to know when our project is starting and write creative,
interesting content. This way you’re helping us big time and we will rejoice at
every published article!

Next to content, we will need a lot of test users. Are you interested in trying our
latest functions? Contact us at info@united-world.org Furthermore, you’ll be
helping us if you’re spreading the idea, share it on social media and tell your
friends and family about it. So there are plenty of other ways helping us if
you like what we’re doing. Become a part of united-world.org.


                         




                                                             


EIN SOCIAL MEDIA HYBRID. Bereits vor drei Jahren haben wir damit begonnen, unsere Idee in die Tat umzusetzen: die Revolutionierung der Berichterstattung! Wir wollen einen Ort schaffen, an dem alle Menschen zu jeder Zeit sagen können, was für sie von Bedeutung ist. Frei von politischer Zensur, kommerziellen Interessen und ohne eine Einschränkung der Reichweite eurer Beiträge!


UNSER NETZWERK. DEINE MÖGLICHKEITEN.United-World.org soll nicht einfach ein weiteres Netzwerk
werden, sondern vielmehr eine Ausdrucksform der gelebten Demokratie. Hier
sollen die Fragen der Zukunft gemeinsam bewältigt, die aus der Gegenwart
reflektiert und die Antworten der Vergangenheit gefunden werden.
FREIE MEINUNGSÄUßERUNG - WELTWEIT.Unsere Plattform ermöglicht es jedem Menschen von seinem Recht auf freie Meinungsäußerung Gebrauch zu machen, ungeachtet von Geschlecht, Herkunft oder sozialem Status. Für uns bildet das den wichtigsten Grundpfeiler der Demokratie und einer lebenswerten Welt!

SCHÜTZT JOURNALISTEN. Oft passiert es, dass Journalisten in vielen Teilen der Erde nach der Veröffentlichung ihrer Artikel politisch verfolgt werden. Dann wird der Fokus auf die Verfolgung gelenkt, die ursprüngliche Nachricht geht dabei aber unter. EIN SCHUTZWALL GEGEN DIE SOCIAL MEDIA NACHRICHTENFLUT.Viele Menschen fühlen sich durch die einseitige
Berichterstattung bevormundet. Es wird zunehmend schwierig zu erkennen, wofür sich
die Bevölkerung tatsächlich interessiert.




DEINE STIMME ZÄHLT. Ihr seid Autoren und Leser zugleich. Eure Beiträge werden
zunächst in eurer Region gebunden und können sich danach global entfalten.
KEINE ALGORITHMEN - IHR ENTSCHEIDET. Die vorsortierten Nachrichten, mit denen uns die etablierten sozialen Netzwerke täglich füttern, sind schnell ermüdend. Über unser innovatives Wertungssystem wird die Community selbst entscheiden können, welche Nachrichten eine höhere Ebene erreichen. So lasst ihr den wirklich wichtigen Nachrichten eine immer höhere Reichweite zuteilwerden.



REGIONALE NACHRICHTEN, WELTWEIT VERBREITET. Beiträge, die dich und deine Umwelt betreffen.
Meldungen geschrieben von den Menschen am Ort des Geschehens. So verbindet
United-World.org den Aufbau eines sozialen Netzwerks mit dem eines Newsportals.
Die Nachrichten werden nach Themen sortiert und den betreffenden Orten, Regionen
und Nationen zugeordnet.VERGANGENHEIT, GEGENWART, ZUKUNFT. Die Nutzer können sich zielgerichtet und nachhaltig über aktuelle und vergangene Ereignisse informieren, alle Nachrichten erhalten einen Zeitstempel. So verhindern wir, dass Veröffentlichungen immer wieder aufgewärmt werden, wie es momentan in vielen sozialen Medien der Fall ist.


WO IST DER DISLIKE BUTTON - DISKUTIERT LÖSUNGEN. Wir werden euch Instrumente an die Hand geben mit denen Nachrichten greifbar werden und ihr nicht nur Gefallen oder Missfallen ausdrücken könnt, sondern aktive Diskussionen startet, die zu Lösungsansätzen führen können.
WER IST EUER FAVORIT. Natürlich kann man sich Autoren und Artikel merken, sodass man über alle Aktualisierungen auf dem Laufenden gehalten wird und später problemlos wieder zu ihnen findet.KEIN WLAN KEIN PROBLEM. Eilnachrichten kann man spontan über SMS posten. So kann man sich auch unterwegs in Sekundenschnelle vernetzen und ist immer über aktuelle Veranstaltungen oder Versammlungen informiert.






HELFT BEI DER VERBREITUNG - WERDET BELOHNT. Bei
Artikeln und Themen die international von Bedeutung sind, ist es hilfreich,
wenn diese in möglichst viele Sprachen übersetzt werden. Deswegen hat jeder
Nutzer die Möglichkeit Artikel, auch die von anderen Usern, zu übersetzen.So können sich länderübergreifende
Interessensgemeinschaften auf natürliche Art und Weise bilden. Auch für die
Arbeit der Übersetzer stellen wir einen Teil der Werbeeinnahmen bereit.



Um neben den Spenden und freiwilligen
Beiträgen weiterhin selbstständig und unabhängig zu sein, haben wir uns dazu
entschieden, Werbung zu erlauben. Es wird verschiedene Werbeflächen geben.
Aufgeteilt werden die Werbeflächen in lokale und überregionale Werbung. Die
Lokalwerbung wird von Händlern aus eurer Umgebung geschaltet. Die Werbeflächen
sind günstig, sodass auch kleine Geschäfte ihren Bekanntheitsgrad vergrößern
können.
Die Händler können sich direkt an die richtige Zielgruppe richten.
Nebenbei werden so lokale Einzelhandelsstrukturen gestärkt. Die Werbung wird
also standortgebunden sein, ansonsten aber nicht personalisiert. Wir tracken
eure Interessensgebiete nicht und geben auch sonst keine Daten an Werbetreibende
weiter. 
Natürlich bleibt das Anschauen der Werbung freiwillig. Eure Adblocker
verhindern jede Art der Werbung auf unserer Seite zuverlässig. Für all jene,
die keine Lust auf Werbung haben, die Seite und die Autoren aber trotzdem
unterstützen möchten, wird es weiterhin die Möglichkeit geben, kleinere und
größere Beträge zielgerichtet zu spenden.



EUER CONTENT. EURE EINNAHMEN.Wir sind der Meinung, dass ihr als User ebenfalls ein Recht
auf einen Teil der Werbeeinnahmen habt. Schließlich ist es euer Content, über
den wir unsere laufenden Kosten decken müssen. Deshalb erhält jeder verifizierte
Autor 50% der Einnahmen, die über die Lokalwerbung aus seinen Artikeln
eingenommen werden. Die Einnahmen werden ab dem ersten Viewer von uns für euch gesammelt
und ab einem Betrag von 10€ ausgezahlt. Von den Einnahmen der etwas teureren,
überregionalen Werbung werden Projekte und Autoren in Krisengebieten
unterstützt, in denen keine lokale Werbung geschaltet werden kann und die sonst
keine Möglichkeit sehen, ihre Arbeit aufrecht zu erhalten.


Wo ihr ins Spiel kommt…
Nach nunmehr drei Jahren intensiver Arbeit steht die
Beta-Version der Seite. Viele spannende Funktionen sind bereits implementiert.
Eure Unterstützung wird uns dabei helfen, die fehlenden Module fertig zu
stellen, Sicherheitslücken zu schließen und die Plattform grafisch zu
überarbeiten.

Unabhängig von der Höhe der Einnahmen durch das Crowdfunding
werden wir weiter an dem Projekt arbeiten. Ihr entscheidet mit euren Spenden
darüber, wie schnell wir weiterkommen und wie viele Menschen an diesem Projekt
arbeiten können.
Hinzu kommen die enormen Serverauslastungen bei einem solchen
Großprojekt. Wir möchten nach dem offiziellen Start mehrere Server weltweit
verteilt unterhalten, um euch eine hohe Geschwindigkeit und angenehmer
Nutzererfahrung bieten zu können. Die Verteilung der Server auf verschiedene
Länder hat darüber hinaus die Funktion die Sicherung eurer Daten
sicherzustellen. Außerdem sollen die Daten gespiegelt werden, um eine mögliche
Sperrung kritischer Inhalte in Ländern ohne Pressefreiheit zu verhindern.


Andere
Wege der Unterstützung 

Auch mit allem Geld der Welt würde uns das Wichtigste
fehlen: Du! Wenn Ihr also aktiv am Entwicklungsprozess teilhaben möchtet, besucht uns auf facebook oder meldet euch bei uns unter info@united-world.org und werdet
Teil der Community, bereits vor dem offiziellen Start! Dabei bieten wir euch
natürlich die Möglichkeit, bereits Beiträge zu verfassen und unsere neuen
Funktionen zu testen und Eure ersten Beiträge zu veröffentlichen!
Außerdem hilfst du uns natürlich enorm, wenn du unsere Kampagne
verbreitest, oder von unserer Idee deinen Freunden und Familie erzählst. Wenn
du also gerade finanziell nicht in der Lage bist, uns zu unterstützen, dir
unsere Idee aber trotzdem gut gefällt, so kannst du trotzdem ein wichtiger Teil
unseres Projekts werden und in Zukunft davon profitieren.


                          


                                                              

UN HIBRIDO MEDIAL. Hace tres años empezamos a dar vida a nuestra idea: revolucionar las noticias y la forma en que las mismas llegan al público. Queremos crear un lugar donde todo el mundo pueda decir lo que quiera, libre de censura política, intereses comerciales y sin limitación de alcance.






NUESTRA RED. SUS POSIBILIDADES. United-World.org no está destinado a ser otra red social de medios de comunicación, sino una forma de democracia viva.Podría convertirse en una plataforma donde responder preguntas futuras, reflejar nuestro presente y aprender juntos del pasado.LIBERTAD DE EXPRESIÓN - EN TODO EL MUNDO. Nuestra red permitirá que todos los seres humanos hagan uso de su derecho a la libertad de expresión, independientemente de su género, origen o condición social. Esto es esencial para una sociedad autodeterminada. Las preocupaciones de todo el mundo disfrutarán de un alcance sin límites. En nuestra opinión, esto es básico para la democracia.




UNA BARRERA A LA INUNDACIÓN DE NOTICIAS DE LOS MEDIOS SOCIALES. Muchas personas se sienten en desventaja teniendo en cuenta el periodismo unilateral tan extendido en los medios de comunicación. Es difícil identificar cuáles son
los intereses reales de una población en cualquier nación.



TÚ ERES LA VOZ. Nuestros usuarios son lectores y autores al mismo tiempo. Tu contenido se clasificará, se agrupará por regiones y tendrá la oportunidad de ser difundido por todo el mundo.
SIN ALGORITMOS - TÚ DECIDES. Las noticias preseleccionadas por las redes sociales de medios establecidas aburren a mucha gente. Con nuestro innovador sistema de calificación, nuestra comunidad decidirá qué noticias son importantes y deben alcanzar un mayor nivel de visibilidad.




NOTICIAS REGIONALES, ALCANCE MUNDIAL. Historias que te preocupan a ti y
a los que te rodean.Noticias escritas por personas desde el lugar en que ocurren. Así es como united-world.org conecta las redes sociales con los portales de noticias.


PASADO, PRESENTE, FUTURO. Los usuarios pueden informarse
resueltamente y de manera sostenible. Las noticias se ordenarán por tema y se
guardarán en uno de los siete mil millones de lugares. Además, se asignará un límite de tiempo a las noticias para que no se puedan publicar una y otra vez, como
ocurre ahora mismo en las redes sociales en todas partes.
¿NO TIENES WIFI? ¡NO TE PREOCUPES! Los mensajes se pueden cargar de forma inmediata a través de mensajes de texto. De esta manera, puedes conectarte con los demás en cuestión de segundos y estar siempre informado sobre los eventos y reuniones actuales.
¿QUIÉN ES TU FAVORITO? Por supuesto, podrás marcar autores y artículos para volver a ellos más tarde y mantenerte al día de todos sus cambios.
PROTEGER EL PERIODISMO. A veces, los periodistas son arrestados después de publicar una noticia política desafiante. Lo que ocurre entonces es que todos los medios de comunicación hacen un gran despliegue sobre la persecución política, y el artículo en sí se pierde.





EL BOTÓN «NO ME GUSTA» - DISCUTIENDO SOLUCIONES. Te daremos las herramientas para hacer que las noticias sean reales y debatir sobre ellas, no solo hacer clic en
«me gusta» o en «no me gusta». De esta manera, podemos empezar a
encontrar soluciones juntos.
AYUDA A DIFUNDIRLA - CONSIGUE ALGO. Con artículos y temas relevantes a nivel internacional, es útil traducirlos a diferentes idiomas. Por esa razón todos los usuarios disponen de la opción de traducir artículos, incluso los de otros usuarios. De esta manera, se pueden construir comunidades transnacionales de una manera natural. Además, se pueden compartir las experiencias que de otro modo nunca serían públicas, solo porque los autores no podían escribirlas en inglés. Por traducir artículos, también es posible ganar dinero con la publicidad.





Para mantener nuestra
independencia, además de las generosas donaciones, decidimos permitir
publicidad en nuestra página. Habrá diferentes tipos de superficies
publicitarias.
Las superficies estarán separadas tanto en los anuncios locales como en los
nacionales.
Las locales las publicarán los comerciantes de tu zona.
Será barato, por lo que incluso las empresas más pequeñas podrán permitírselo.
Los comerciantes pueden llegar directamente a su grupo objetivo. De esta manera
se refuerza la estructura local de ventas. Los anuncios serán estacionarios,
pero no personalizados.
No haremos un seguimiento de tus intereses y no daremos tus datos personales a
nuestros anunciantes. Por supuesto, ver los anuncios será voluntario. Los
programas que bloquean los anuncios harán que puedas disfrutar de la página
libre de anuncios.
Para todos los que no estáis interesados en los anuncios, pero queréis apoyar a
vuestros autores favoritos o a la propia página, tendréis la oportunidad de
donar sumas pequeñas o grandes de dinero.







SU CONTENIDO. SU BENEFICIO.
Creemos que como usuarios (autores, periodistas, blogueros, escritores...) también tenéis derecho a participar de los ingresos por publicidad. Por este motivo, todos los autores verificados obtienen el 50% de los ingresos por publicidad local en sus artículos.


Desde tu primer visitante, recogeremos el dinero y te lo abonaremos a partir de 10 €. Los ingresos por publicidad nacional e internacional se utilizarán para proyectos y autores de zonas en conflicto u otras regiones que no tienen publicidad y que de lo contrario no podrían continuar con su trabajo.

¿DONDE ENCAJAS TU?

Después de casi tres años de trabajo, la versión beta está terminada. Muchas funciones impresionantes ya están funcionando. Pero la página todavía no está lista. Tenemos que terminar algunos módulos que están por acabar, cerrar brechas de seguridad y darle un lavado de cara gráfico a la página.
Por muy grande que sea el impacto
de esta campaña, seguiremos trabajando en este proyecto. Tú decidirás la
velocidad a la que podemos alcanzar nuestros objetivos y cuántas personas
pueden trabajar juntas en ellos.
También tenemos que comprar una mayor capacidad de servidor y distribuirlos en diferentes países para guardar
tus datos. Además, queremos reflejar los datos, para que no se pueda prohibir en diversos países el posible contenido crítico.
OTRAS FORMAS DE CONTRIBUIR

Incluso con todo el dinero de este mundo, lo más importante seguiría faltando: tú.
Suscríbete con tu dirección de
correo electrónico o síguenos a través de facebook. Infórmate de cuándo se inicia
nuestro proyecto y escribe contenidos creativos e interesantes. ¡De esta manera nos ayudarás muchísimo y disfrutaremos con cada artículo publicado!
Además de contenidos, necesitaremos muchos usuarios de prueba. ¿Estás interesado en probar nuestras funciones más recientes? Ponte en contacto con nosotros en
info@united-world.org Por otra parte, nos puedes ayudar
dando a conocer la idea, compartiéndola en las redes sociales y contándoselo a
tus amigos y familiares. Así que hay muchas otras formas
de ayudarnos si te gusta lo que estamos haciendo.

To have a custom built cart, one done right, is most definitely worth the risk in kidnapping, I MEAN enlisting the help of nice people who will not be tied and gagged, nor let go without a scratch after it's finished. Oops, did I digress again? Maybe...maybe not. Squirrel! WHERE?!</p><p>Other expenses are broken down into daily costs.

</h3><h3>The Statistics tell the story...</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are over 2 million people incarcerated in the United States, best estimate is 10% of them are veterans</li>
<li>There are over 2.3 million American veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars at least 20% of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have PTSD and/or Depression.</li>
<li>An estimated 460,000 veterans suffer from PTSD.</li>
<li>Over 260,000 veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom so far have been diagnosed with TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury).</li>
<li>There are 300,000 homeless veterans sleeping on the streets…and 1.4 million at the risk of becoming homeless.</li>
<li>Veterans have to wait months for an initial doctors appointment.</li>
<li>The Veterans Administration have resources to serve only fractions of our veterans.</li>
<li>Nearly 5000 veterans die by their own hands every year…that’s one veteran every 2 hours.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Who is Conviction Customs?</span><br/>
</h3><div>
<p>Conviction Customs will be a independently owned motorcycle shop, who will provide all ranges of service and custom on-off motorcycle builds.  Conviction  Customs will also serve as an online retailer for used parts, focusing on primarily sportbikes. CC will also be an online dealer for other accessories and apparel related to the motorcycle and powersport community. CC’s physical location will provide full service work, performance modifications and restoration to the Jacksonville and surrounding communities. CC will only be staffed by ex-convicts, primarily military veteran ex-convicts, as a way to provide these people the ability to rebuild their lives. Portions of CC’s profits will also go to The Conviction House, Inc; which provides support services to ex-convict military veterans.</p>
<p>This campaign is more then just opening a small business.  It's about providing the ability to fund a non-profit organization to provide help to warriors like myself who have ended up on the wrong side of the law due to problems related to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Right now, there are approximately 200,000 Veterans incarcerated, which is around 10% of the U.S.'s incarcerated population.  </p>
<p>Conviction Customs will build four custom motorcycles each year and raffle them off at the following events:  Sturgis, Laconia, Daytona Bike Week and Daytona Biketoberfest.  Approximately 1,000,000 people attend Daytona Bike Week each year.  A survey was recently conducted and concluded that 60% of people surveyed would purchase a $5 raffle ticket for a custom motorcycle.  The proceeds of these raffles would directly benefit The Conviction House.</p>
<p>The Conviction House goal is to provide support services to incarcerated / previously incarcerated Veterans, Veterans convicted of felonies directly related to PTSD / TBI, and homeless Veterans.  We will also provide support to non-veteran incarcerated persons and person convicted of felonies on a case by case basis.  The aim is to provide services such as support groups, counseling, employment screening and placement and educational services.  Once enough funding has been accumulated for The Conviction House, we would like to establish per-deim based housing for homeless Veterans and Veterans being released from incarceration.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>The funds produced from contributions will go directly to start-up cost associated with starting Conviction Customs.  Conviction Customs will start out as an Ebay retailer of quality used motorcycle parts obtained by parting out motorcycles purchased from the community.  CC will also be a vendor/dealer for several companies that produce custom parts and apparel related to the powersport community.  Our physical location will provide full service work, performance modifications and restoration to the Jacksonville and surrounding communities.<p>Specifically we will need $50,000 to start up.  These funds will be used to lease our physical location, do legal filings, purchase tools, acquire initial motorcycle inventory for parts, initial apparel and accessories inventory; and lastly initial payroll.  We will be using funds from contributions first to file our Limited Liability Company paperwork through LegalZoom.com, though Conviction Customs is already a registered DBA in the State of Florida.  Here is a break down of the start-up cost expected:</p>

<p><span>The Impact</span></p>
<p>The impact Conviction Customs in partnership with The Conviction House is tremendous.  Currently, well known Veteran's support organizations are denying help to this under-known segment of the Veteran population.  I have attempted to register with several organizations that are well known to help and support Veterans with visible and non-visible wounds such as PTSD and TBI, and have been turned down by everyone because of my background.  The other Veterans who stood up to protect this country will face the same challenges as they attempt to get their lives back together.</p>
<p>Here are links to stories around the country, to include my own story, that show how PTSD is impacting our Veterans and how many Veterans have found themselves incarcerated.</p>

</ul></div>","The Statistics tell the story...

There are over 2 million people incarcerated in the United States, best estimate is 10% of them are veterans
There are over 2.3 million American veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars at least 20% of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have PTSD and/or Depression.
An estimated 460,000 veterans suffer from PTSD.
Over 260,000 veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom so far have been diagnosed with TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury).
There are 300,000 homeless veterans sleeping on the streets…and 1.4 million at the risk of becoming homeless.
Veterans have to wait months for an initial doctors appointment.
The Veterans Administration have resources to serve only fractions of our veterans.
Nearly 5000 veterans die by their own hands every year…that’s one veteran every 2 hours.


Who is Conviction Customs?

Conviction Customs will be a independently owned motorcycle shop, who will provide all ranges of service and custom on-off motorcycle builds.  Conviction  Customs will also serve as an online retailer for used parts, focusing on primarily sportbikes. CC will also be an online dealer for other accessories and apparel related to the motorcycle and powersport community. CC’s physical location will provide full service work, performance modifications and restoration to the Jacksonville and surrounding communities. CC will only be staffed by ex-convicts, primarily military veteran ex-convicts, as a way to provide these people the ability to rebuild their lives. Portions of CC’s profits will also go to The Conviction House, Inc; which provides support services to ex-convict military veterans.
This campaign is more then just opening a small business.  It's about providing the ability to fund a non-profit organization to provide help to warriors like myself who have ended up on the wrong side of the law due to problems related to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Right now, there are approximately 200,000 Veterans incarcerated, which is around 10% of the U.S.'s incarcerated population.  
Conviction Customs will build four custom motorcycles each year and raffle them off at the following events:  Sturgis, Laconia, Daytona Bike Week and Daytona Biketoberfest.  Approximately 1,000,000 people attend Daytona Bike Week each year.  A survey was recently conducted and concluded that 60% of people surveyed would purchase a $5 raffle ticket for a custom motorcycle.  The proceeds of these raffles would directly benefit The Conviction House.
The Conviction House goal is to provide support services to incarcerated / previously incarcerated Veterans, Veterans convicted of felonies directly related to PTSD / TBI, and homeless Veterans.  We will also provide support to non-veteran incarcerated persons and person convicted of felonies on a case by case basis.  The aim is to provide services such as support groups, counseling, employment screening and placement and educational services.  Once enough funding has been accumulated for The Conviction House, we would like to establish per-deim based housing for homeless Veterans and Veterans being released from incarceration.
What We Need & What You GetThe funds produced from contributions will go directly to start-up cost associated with starting Conviction Customs.  Conviction Customs will start out as an Ebay retailer of quality used motorcycle parts obtained by parting out motorcycles purchased from the community.  CC will also be a vendor/dealer for several companies that produce custom parts and apparel related to the powersport community.  Our physical location will provide full service work, performance modifications and restoration to the Jacksonville and surrounding communities.Specifically we will need $50,000 to start up.  These funds will be used to lease our physical location, do legal filings, purchase tools, acquire initial motorcycle inventory for parts, initial apparel and accessories inventory; and lastly initial payroll.  We will be using funds from contributions first to file our Limited Liability Company paperwork through LegalZoom.com, though Conviction Customs is already a registered DBA in the State of Florida.  Here is a break down of the start-up cost expected:

<p><b>Spice Rubs</b> - although we call them 'spice rubs' these products are much more versatile than just for rubbing on meat. You could call them flavour packs when you add them to stir fries, salads or sauces. Or you might term them spice sprinkles when you dust them on vegetables, a lean steak or chicken breast before searing. We are in the habit of calling them spice rubs because their original intention was to be massaged into meat before barbecuing low and slow over charcoal and wood fires. Regardless of what you decided to name them once you get them home their versatility is peerless in Australian owned and made products. </p>
<p>Our spice rubs are hand blended and packaged in 100g bags, in Gracemere, Australia. They contain no sugar or salt, no preservatives and no anti-caking agents. They come in two flavours: </p>
<p><i>Mind Your Own Brisket</i> is a pepper and paprika based rub that is best on beef products and adds zing to veggies or salads. The pepper is by no means overpowering, but does all it can to enhance the flavours in the cut of beef, or other meat, you choose. </p>
<p><i>Howdy Amigo</i> is a texmex based rub that is best with chicken and pork. It has a stronger flavour that brings the fiesta to any meal. It can be added to meals before, during or after cooking to impress varying pallets. For those who like hotter texmex food you can add your own fresh or dried chilis to ramp up the heat.</p>

<p><b>Small Batch BBQ Sauces</b> - Our small batch BBQ sauces are hand made and bottled in Gracemere, Australia in batches of 5 x 270g bottles. We use Australian ingredients where possible, and add no salt or preservatives. The sauces are versatile Texas style BBQ sauces with definite Australian infusions, They can be used for marinating, basting, braising, or as a condiment. Every sauce uses tomato and vinegar as a base and then we have a great time adding Aussie flavours and seasonal ingredients. Each batch is slightly different from the next but we enjoy that as part of the fun. In your perk pack you will receive a random selection of the batches we have available unless otherwise stated.

<p>It’s time to change the world! That’s why you came to our page isn’t it?  Well, we are excited to give you an opportunity to do so.  But, in case you weren’t driven here by your overwhelming desire to save all of mankind from impending doom I should probably give you a bit of background on who we are, how it is we are planning to accomplish our mission, and where you fit in to all of this.</p>
<h2><b><br/></b></h2>
<h2><b>T h e  B a c k g r o u n d</b></h2>
<p>My name is Michael Ling.  My amazing wife Judy and I have been married for eleven years. Those eleven years have produced one handsome son, one beautiful daughter (my daddy’s girl), a young God fearing woman that we have adopted as our own and our faithful dog Bell.  These years have also birthed and grown in us a desire to see people healed from the hurt and pain that have followed and burdened them throughout their lives. </p>
<p>While I have worked with animals for the past sixteen years, just recently having changed our scenery from where we were born and raised in Southern California to accept an exciting job offer as the administrator for a group of veterinarian hospitals in North Las Vegas, my heart is and has always been for all things film. To the smallest name at the end of the credits to the biggest name on the marquee, the impact that movies create in each and every heart and mind have inspired me for as long as I can remember. This brings us to our “Journey.”  <i><a href=""http://www.journeyentertainmentstudios.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Journey Entertainment Studios</a> </i>is the culmination of my love for all things film and our overwhelming burden to share true stories with the world, bringing hope and healing to others who may relate to the heartaches and triumphs of our movies.  Since its inception eight years ago we have written, acted in, produced and directed our own projects and have been hired by others to do the same.  Our dream is to make life altering, impactful films on a full time basis.</p>

<p>At “Journey” we don’t believe that making movies is enough.  There are many different studios that create movies specifically for entertainment purposes and we applaud them.  We all need to get away to another world and another time.  Here at <i>Journey Entertainment Studios </i>we know that many times for millions of people that getting away is not enough.  People need hope.  They need to see that no matter where they are at they are loved and valued.  They need to see that there are people that have overcome the situations that they are in right at that moment and in their mourning there can be joy.  They can overcome.  God loves them and has a plan for them to prosper.  That’s where we come in. We are committed to not only making movies that showcase real life stories and their circumstances but also in giving a percentage of the proceeds to avenues of intervention already created to assist those who have not yet found their freedom from the afflictions in which they are plagued.  </p>

<p>Domestic violence is a brutal and widely underreported crime that affects over 12 million women and men over the course of a year. Twenty-four people per minute are victims of rape, physical violence or stalking by an intimate partner in the United States. Nearly 3 in 10 women (29%) and 1 in 10 men (10%) in the US have experienced rape, physical violence and/or stalking by a partner and report a related impact on their functioning. Almost half of all women and men in the United States have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner in their lifetime. (48.4% and 48.8% respectively) The astounding numbers reported here from <a href=""http://www.thehotline.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The National Domestic Violence Hotline</a> are why our first feature length film will be tackling this despairing subject.  We feel compelled to reach as many people as possible with a real life story of the hopelessness, heartbreak and destruction of a relationship riddled with domestic violence to the restoration of joy, peace and a prosperous future through the healing power of God’s love. </p>

<p>We now come to where the rubber meets the road.  This is where you come in.  We are looking to partner with people to reach our goal of $20,000 to turn this script into the impactful movie it promises to be.  I know what you are thinking. What will $20,000 allow us to do and is that even enough money to make a movie? Let me begin by saying that we have already put countless hours and thousands of dollars of our own into making this a reality. All of the money that we are seeking will go towards production and marketing for the film. We will be paying for the actors, equipment, sound engineer, make-up artist, and locations.  I will be wearing the producer and director hat for the film. I have experience directing and producing on multiple productions, including a movie that premiered at Camelot Theater in Palm Springs, California. Another way we are able to make a quality film with a low budget is by being selective in theaters. By utilizing a central theater in each geographic location instead showing in every theater in every city we will still have the exposure that we seek while maintaining a low overhead. Along with these processes we have a solid marketing plan and established relationships with associates from many different forms of media, including television and radio. While we are confident that we will meet or exceed our goal, we believe in having a plan B.  Rest assured that whatever amount we raise will be used to create this film and get it to the big screen.  As they say, ‘the show must go on.’ As a bonus to giving to a worthy cause and bringing a dark subject into the light, we have gifts and incentives in appreciation to your generosity, including having your own cameo in the film. </p>

T h e  C h a r g e
It’s time to change the world! That’s why you came to our page isn’t it?  Well, we are excited to give you an opportunity to do so.  But, in case you weren’t driven here by your overwhelming desire to save all of mankind from impending doom I should probably give you a bit of background on who we are, how it is we are planning to accomplish our mission, and where you fit in to all of this.

T h e  B a c k g r o u n d
My name is Michael Ling.  My amazing wife Judy and I have been married for eleven years. Those eleven years have produced one handsome son, one beautiful daughter (my daddy’s girl), a young God fearing woman that we have adopted as our own and our faithful dog Bell.  These years have also birthed and grown in us a desire to see people healed from the hurt and pain that have followed and burdened them throughout their lives. 
While I have worked with animals for the past sixteen years, just recently having changed our scenery from where we were born and raised in Southern California to accept an exciting job offer as the administrator for a group of veterinarian hospitals in North Las Vegas, my heart is and has always been for all things film. To the smallest name at the end of the credits to the biggest name on the marquee, the impact that movies create in each and every heart and mind have inspired me for as long as I can remember. This brings us to our “Journey.”  Journey Entertainment Studios is the culmination of my love for all things film and our overwhelming burden to share true stories with the world, bringing hope and healing to others who may relate to the heartaches and triumphs of our movies.  Since its inception eight years ago we have written, acted in, produced and directed our own projects and have been hired by others to do the same.  Our dream is to make life altering, impactful films on a full time basis.

T h e  M i s s i o n
At “Journey” we don’t believe that making movies is enough.  There are many different studios that create movies specifically for entertainment purposes and we applaud them.  We all need to get away to another world and another time.  Here at Journey Entertainment Studios we know that many times for millions of people that getting away is not enough.  People need hope.  They need to see that no matter where they are at they are loved and valued.  They need to see that there are people that have overcome the situations that they are in right at that moment and in their mourning there can be joy.  They can overcome.  God loves them and has a plan for them to prosper.  That’s where we come in. We are committed to not only making movies that showcase real life stories and their circumstances but also in giving a percentage of the proceeds to avenues of intervention already created to assist those who have not yet found their freedom from the afflictions in which they are plagued.

<p>I am the mother of three children, the youngest only 8 years old, and a breast cancer survivor. After realizing a 9-5 job with no schedule flexibility was not going to work for me, but not wanting to end my career in writing and marketing, I came up with the idea of starting my own agency. I also decided I would seek out other marketers, writers, designers, and developers who also need flexibility due to a chronic or terminal illness of their own (or of their family member).</p>
<p>Medical expenses have wiped out my savings and maxed out my credit cards, but I've been fortunate enough to remain employed almost continuously since my diagnosis. I am also fortunate to have a great team of people willing to freelance or work on the side to help me get the agency going, some with years of experience in graphic design, content marketing, public relations, blogging, and website creation. And some of those wonderful people are also cancer survivors.</p>
<h3>Money from this campaign will go directly toward startup expenses, including:</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>The creation of a website and promotional materials to market the agency</li>
<li>Software and hardware to run the business, such as Adobe Creative Cloud</li>
<li>A safety net to cover the pay of those working for me in case our first few clients pay late (or not at all)</li>
</ul></div><div>
<p>Your contribution will not only help me, but it will help others who want to remain employed in a field they love, but are challenged by the 9-5 schedule and limited PTO they receive. And, if my agency becomes as successful as I hope it will become, it will ensure I can leave something behind for my children should my prognosis change and the worst happen.</p>
<h3>No Guarantee of Success</h3>
<p>I realize that wanting to start an agency and hoping it will be successful does not guarantee things will work out as planned. However, I've been working in marketing for more than a decade and have the support of others with as much - or more - experience than I have. Additionally, I've already secured several clients and intend to continue working at my 9-5 job as long as I can so that I need not take a paycheck from the agency and can instead focus on its growth and on paying those who contribute to its success.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>If you can't help out financially, please share this campaign with others that you know. And, if you or someone you know is suffering from a chronic medical condition that requires schedule flexibility, please reach out to me.</p>

I have 18 years experience in dog training, 8 years experience in Vet assistance and 2 years as a business owner.<a rel=""noopener nofollow"" tabindex=""-1"" title=""HTML""></a>
I'm a good little saver and can squirrel money away like my grandparents and I work solid 15 hour days, 7 days a week.</div><div><br/></div><div>
</div><p>This campaign is created out of necessity. The financial struggles faced by my job are insurmountable. The banks are bound to very strict rules and according to them I do not have a job and therefore do not qualify for funding. As a 40 year old white female living in the north and working with animals I can not find a single grant I qualify for. </p><div>
</div><p>I need to be able to hire competent help and set up a work environment that is self sustaining and requires less maintenance.</p><div>
</div><p>This funding would go directly into wages for carpenters to repair current kennels, winterize buildings for efficient energy use and help create proper fencing. This funding will also go into wages for a part time hardworking individual to help with daily chores, maintenance and entertaining our four legged guests.</p><div>
</div><p>Bakers Acres Kennels is unique because we are not a typical ""storage unit"" kennel. We offer pups a vacation, I know, I know...all kennels say that, but we truly are. Dogs get the run of the property and help me in the garden or keep my feet warm while I'm grooming. I work hard to bond with each pup, that bond is what makes me unique. Humans tend to create animals that cannot live without us, then we stick them in a kennel where they release anxious energy any way they can and destroy the kennel while creating noise levels that have neighbors signing petitions. Once a pup is bonded to me they can happily follow me, feeling safe and loved. I also believe strongly in being honest, even to owners who hide behind their rose colored glasses. (I love mine!

I have 18 years experience in dog training, 8 years experience in Vet assistance and 2 years as a business owner.
I'm a good little saver and can squirrel money away like my grandparents and I work solid 15 hour days, 7 days a week.
This campaign is created out of necessity. The financial struggles faced by my job are insurmountable. The banks are bound to very strict rules and according to them I do not have a job and therefore do not qualify for funding. As a 40 year old white female living in the north and working with animals I can not find a single grant I qualify for. 
I need to be able to hire competent help and set up a work environment that is self sustaining and requires less maintenance.
This funding would go directly into wages for carpenters to repair current kennels, winterize buildings for efficient energy use and help create proper fencing. This funding will also go into wages for a part time hardworking individual to help with daily chores, maintenance and entertaining our four legged guests.
Bakers Acres Kennels is unique because we are not a typical ""storage unit"" kennel. We offer pups a vacation, I know, I know...all kennels say that, but we truly are. Dogs get the run of the property and help me in the garden or keep my feet warm while I'm grooming. I work hard to bond with each pup, that bond is what makes me unique. Humans tend to create animals that cannot live without us, then we stick them in a kennel where they release anxious energy any way they can and destroy the kennel while creating noise levels that have neighbors signing petitions. Once a pup is bonded to me they can happily follow me, feeling safe and loved. I also believe strongly in being honest, even to owners who hide behind their rose colored glasses. (I love mine! They are large rosé pink frames with several diamonds in each corner and multicolored roses painted along the arms...Elton would be proud:))  Another unique thing about Bakers Acres is that we are passionate and dedicated to stray animals.

<p><b>Brief summary</b></p>
<p>In India nowadays, reality is that 32,7% of its citizens are considered, according to
international standards, not as poor, but as extreme poor. Famine, insufficient
health conditions and illiteracy seem to be a natural condition, being
especially present in the rural areas of India. In this male dominated society,
women struggle with cultural limitations and discrimination making them the
disadvantaged out of the disadvantaged. Unable to ignore their struggle, we decided to act and started the Saath Mahila Credits and Savings Cooperative Society Ltd.. Working as a branch of Saath Charitable Trust, a 25 year old organisation, the Cooperative Society tackles women´s need for financial independence. </p>
<p>In
Hindi “saath” means together, which is the best way to describe how we work and
what we aim. Our efforts are invested in a cooperative manner in creating
inclusive societies through the empowering of the individuals forming it. Our
NGO is involved in a wide variety of programs targeting the disadvantaged in
the Indian society ranging from providing informal education, to children
living on construction sites, to providing financial independence. The latter
is the core of this campaign. Saath Mahila Savings and Credit Cooperative
Society Ltd. offers, after only four years, financial services to over 4400
women in rural areas of Ahmedabad district enabling them to expand and improve
their options to livelihood. We promote, a previously non-existing, saving
habit and grant the women access to micro loans aimed at different financial necessities
including business opening investments and unexpected health problems. This
campaign intends to expand our services through opening our third branch in the
village of Mandal. </p>
<p><b>What we need</b></p>
<p>We promote self-sustainable and long lasting projects, which do not rely on
donations and funders. Our Micro financial services ensure self-sustainability
through interests on the various financial products. Nonetheless, these require
an initial one-time investment: Reserves to ensure the initial emissions of
loans. Our expansion to the village of Mandal will require at least $60,000 for
this purpose. We aim at fundraising the bare minimum we need. </p>
<p>We kindly invite you to contribute as much as you can and remind you that
every contribution, as small it might be, counts! Further we would like to use
the occasion to thank you in advance for your interest and help.</p>
<p>In Saath we are aware of the common mistrust towards NGOs and invite you to
visit our website <a href=""http://www.saath.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.saath.org</a> where you
will find our annual reports including our financial statements. <b>Transparency
is a must</b>.  </p>
<p><b>The
impact of your help</b></p>
<p>The impact of your contributions will be far-reaching, as the opening of a
new brand will <b>grant financial independence to over 1000 women for a
lifetime</b>. Financial inclusion is a vital tool in the fight against poverty.
Access to financial service enables these women to become micro entrepreneurs
and to insure themselves against complications as drought or sickness. Further,
this has a direct impact on their children, who often face child labor given the
fact that families cannot afford school expenses. A small effort on your side can empower
women and their children to the necessary means to overcome poverty,
discrimination and illiteracy, as plain and simple as that. </p>
<p><b>Risks and challenges</b></p>
<p>The risks of our expansion are nearly non-existent given the fact that over
100 women have already shown interest for our services in the city of Mandal
and the branches in Viramgam and Dholka have been successfully operating for
over four years. The main challenge we face is the provision of reserves for
our expansions, as the demand for financial services in rural India is high and
nearly unsupplied. </p>
<p><b>Other forms of contributing </b></p>
<p>If currently you cannot contribute to our cause financially you can always
help us spreading the word and sharing our campaign with family, friends and
people who might be interested in it. </p>
<p>Once again thank you. We could not make it without you!</p>

women in rural areas of Ahmedabad district enabling them to expand and improve
their options to livelihood. We promote, a previously non-existing, saving
habit and grant the women access to micro loans aimed at different financial necessities
including business opening investments and unexpected health problems. This
campaign intends to expand our services through opening our third branch in the
village of Mandal. 
What we need
We promote self-sustainable and long lasting projects, which do not rely on
donations and funders. Our Micro financial services ensure self-sustainability
through interests on the various financial products. Nonetheless, these require
an initial one-time investment: Reserves to ensure the initial emissions of
loans. Our expansion to the village of Mandal will require at least $60,000 for
this purpose. We aim at fundraising the bare minimum we need. 
We kindly invite you to contribute as much as you can and remind you that
every contribution, as small it might be, counts! Further we would like to use
the occasion to thank you in advance for your interest and help.
In Saath we are aware of the common mistrust towards NGOs and invite you to
visit our website www.saath.org where you
will find our annual reports including our financial statements. Transparency
is a must.  
The
impact of your help
The impact of your contributions will be far-reaching, as the opening of a
new brand will grant financial independence to over 1000 women for a
lifetime. Financial inclusion is a vital tool in the fight against poverty.
Access to financial service enables these women to become micro entrepreneurs
and to insure themselves against complications as drought or sickness. Further,
this has a direct impact on their children, who often face child labor given the
fact that families cannot afford school expenses. A small effort on your side can empower
women and their children to the necessary means to overcome poverty,
discrimination and illiteracy, as plain and simple as that. 
Risks and challenges
The risks of our expansion are nearly non-existent given the fact that over
100 women have already shown interest for our services in the city of Mandal
and the branches in Viramgam and Dholka have been successfully operating for
over four years. The main challenge we face is the provision of reserves for
our expansions, as the demand for financial services in rural India is high and
nearly unsupplied. 
Other forms of contributing 
If currently you cannot contribute to our cause financially you can always
help us spreading the word and sharing our campaign with family, friends and
people who might be interested in it. 
Once again thank you. We could not make it without you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I am Satyama Lasby. I am passionate about communities and have lived in different communities since 2009, when I left my career in Canada to live a life with deeper meaning.

This community has a reputation for bring one that supports openness in relationships, yet the community remains to be one with secrets on the relating end of the spectrum.

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">2) Connecting </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">people with poverty and mental health issues to employment opportunities and the best healthcare options available. </span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>How are We doing this?</b></span></div><div>1) <b>Healthiest Bottles : These bottles have been researched extensively. </b>When tested, the Total Dissolved Solids test for these bottles remained at '0'. All other bottles - including other glass bottles - had some leaching. These bottles are revolutionary!</div><div>In addition, HEALTHY BOTTLES = HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. They are an environmental choice. For each bottle bought, countless bottles are saved from being produced from fossil fuels and going into the landfill and oceans.<br/>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">2) <b>Providing healthcare and counselling opportunities to people with poverty and mental health issues :  </b>50% of the profits of these bottles goes towards this goal. Poverty and mental health issues often go hand-in-hand; when people have trouble functioning and making a living they often don't reach out and can suffer tragic consequences including illness and at worst violation of others and/or suicide. Gaining access to sufficient healthcare and counselling opportunities is essential to ameliorating these situations and eradicating the issues. With this they can become functioning participants in their community/society who may also be able to hold down employment - creating  stability for themselves in and with their community. <br/>This is what the creation of these bottles is truly dedicated to.</span></div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434983193/a3cid7ptovjcansoht2p.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 596.016px; height: 451px;""/></p></div><div><b>Who I am and my Vision</b></div><div>

</div></div>","What We Stand For

H = helping, O = opportunities (for) P = personal (and) E= employment (issues)
HOPE Stream is a social purpose business whose goal is to create Healthy Communities in two ways:  1) Creating the healthiest drinking bottle out there
2) Connecting people with poverty and mental health issues to employment opportunities and the best healthcare options available. 
How are We doing this?1) Healthiest Bottles : These bottles have been researched extensively. When tested, the Total Dissolved Solids test for these bottles remained at '0'. All other bottles - including other glass bottles - had some leaching. These bottles are revolutionary!In addition, HEALTHY BOTTLES = HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. They are an environmental choice. For each bottle bought, countless bottles are saved from being produced from fossil fuels and going into the landfill and oceans.
2) Providing healthcare and counselling opportunities to people with poverty and mental health issues :  50% of the profits of these bottles goes towards this goal. Poverty and mental health issues often go hand-in-hand; when people have trouble functioning and making a living they often don't reach out and can suffer tragic consequences including illness and at worst violation of others and/or suicide. Gaining access to sufficient healthcare and counselling opportunities is essential to ameliorating these situations and eradicating the issues. With this they can become functioning participants in their community/society who may also be able to hold down employment - creating  stability for themselves in and with their community. This is what the creation of these bottles is truly dedicated to.Who I am and my Vision


My name is Marsaye and I have been counselling (Cdn spelling) people with mental health issues for the past 32 years. I have a Masters degree and have worked entirely on the front lines. Being only one person with a lot of vision, I am calling on the community far and wide to help grow the HOPE.
The magnitude of this goal is immeasurable. Imagine living in a world where people who are behaving strangely are cared for and helped, rather than ignored, feared and pushed away. What impact does that behaviour have on them? If this is turned around....Imagine how they then will carry this 'help' forward and contribute! This is the Vision of HOPE Stream.




  What We Need & What You Get   $10,000 will produce more bottles, professionalize the brochure with an artist and with shiny, better quality paper, hire people to do sales and demo's, and perhaps some advertising.  If we do not reach our entire goal the funds will go towards 1) producing more bottles, 2) brochures printed on better-quality paper, and 3) hiring people to do demos and sales. All of these will still help us grow HOPE significantly.
In return for your generous contributions, I am offering perks ranging from: personalized thank you's, your own personal HOPE Water Bottle, a free counselling session, coming to speak at your event about HOPE, and/or offering cross-promotion for our top sponsors.  Have a look at the perks list on the side and choose your favourite!

   The Impact The impact is multi-layered and results in the creation of healthy communities with: less crime, less conflict and
 people helping each other through the difficult times. It starts at 
home ~ in our communities with the people we know. It is a wonderful feeling to experience the satisfaction of doing what you can to help.



    Risks & Challenges   As this grows I intend to let go of some of my front line work ( as an independent service provider) and hire people in my place. My role will then be to help the front line people to debrief and keep their energy focused. 
In this process, I can dedicate more time to the creation of more health care provider - client links, as well as to bottle sales.

<p>Hotti Biscotti is <b>passion</b>.
It is <b>caring</b>. It is <b>community</b>. </p>
<p>Six years ago, Debby Stroud found the courage to walk away
from her career and follow her dream of running a bakery.  From a small catering business, we have grown
into an entity capable of serving huge weddings, conferences, and pleasing a
steady stream of walk-in customers with our unique take on classic Italian
dessert. Since day one, Hotti Biscotti has been running on passion, <i>lots</i> of sugary sweetness, and a little
bit of faith in the support of the Hamilton community. </p>
<p>Two years later, a little bit of faith went a long way, and after four great years Hotti’s heart is growing beyond the walls of our tiny shop in Westdale Village.
The locally owned and operated bakery is ready to take another leap –into the centre
of the booming James North food scene. Our softer texture biscotti, peanut
butter pops, chocolate toffee pretzels, snowball cookies, and ice cream
sandwiches are just the tip of the iceberg – we’re capable of stocking a larger
storefront with brownies, cookies, vegan options and even more brand new
tantalizing treats that we know you’ll be crazy about!</p>
<p>We’re asking Hamilton to help us make the downtown core a
little bit sweeter. </p>
<p><b>What Hotti Needs</b></p>
<p>Expansion is AWESOME, but growth is costly. Our flexible ask
of $10,000 should help put our worries to rest and focus on the many amazing

<p><b>Why give? To help us <i>give more.</i></b></p>
<p>This campaign isn’t all about financial backing. The concept
of crowd-funding finds it’s roots in inspiring and involving the community to
get behind a project they care about. We want to foster a following that helps
us reach our goals not just for the big move, but to help us benefit the
community in the long term. <b>Giving to
Hotti is giving to Hamilton</b>. </p>
<p><b>Hamilton needs love</b>.
From staff to clients, we recognize value of truly connecting to those around
you. Whether it’s a neighbour, a friend, or someone you make eye contact with
on the HSR, a little bit of sweetness goes a long way! A larger, more visible
location helps us meet and connect with even more amazing Hamiltonians every
day.</p>
<p><b>Hamilton needs jobs</b>.
Not only have we turned hundreds of biscotti critics into believers with our
signature softer treats, Debby has spent long hours teaching her close knit
team how to craft a perfect chocolate covered pretzel and tie the prettiest
ribbon. Our fun, inclusive, and innovative workplace atmosphere serves as the
perfect entry-level into the booming Hamilton food industry. </p>
<p><b>Hamilton needs
helping hands</b>. An avid supporter of animal rights, local charity initiatives, and simply
supporting her fellow local dreamers, Debby has given endlessly to
local charities and organizations close to her heart. </p>
<p>In just 4 years, we have been capable of touching thousands
of lives from the walls of a shoebox bakery. In the heart of Hamilton with room

being negotiated with telecommunications companies and government agencies.
4. It is our goal to have all PHCs, secondary and eventually
tertiary healthcare facilities connected for ease of access for both
patients/clients and health workers in the very near future
This project will obviously serve as an entry point for
other health initiatives. 
Our challenges may be much; funding, difficulty in reaching
rural facilities due to difficult terrains, government bureaucracy, etc. But we
are optimistic and enthusiatic. We work with volunteers and already established local authorities, which helps to minimize administrative costs and ensure that
most of the money raised goes towards our course. 
Our immediate needs;
1. Funds
2. Vehicles for easy transportation and navigation of
difficult road networks 
3. Of course MORE volunteers
PLEASE DONATE TO HELP US PUT TELEPHONES AND PERHAPS INTERNET
TO SERVE THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE POOR AND NEEDY, AND ALSO HELP TO SPREAD THE
WORD USING INDIEGOGO SHARE TOOLS. THANK YOU!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My wife and I own the Tyler Firearms Training Academy where we conduct self-defense training for individuals and groups throughout Maryland.  We want to expand our operations and create a new security guard agency so we can hire more veterans and National Guardsmen to give them the financial freedom to still be able to serve their country without fear of being docked in their paychecks or not receive raises or promotions based on their military service.  Our expanded training facility and security guard agency will allow currently serving National Guardsmen and military veterans to have jobs where their employer understands the military way of life, because we live the military way of life.</p>
<p>Your contribution will allow us to expand our current facility and hire 8 to 10 new veteran instructors, sales staff and support personnel.  We're also building a security guard agency where we can hire an additional 20 to 30 military veterans.  This is phase 2 of our plan, and we are confident that our expanded training facility will fund the start-up of the security guard agency.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>To expand our existing facility and hire more veterans, we're estimating the cost to be $40,000.  My wife and I are investing $15,000 of our own money, so that leaves $25,000 that we need from you to get us started.  Once operational, the business will be able to support our ongoing operations.  We just need a little help to get us going - we can take care of the rest.  </p>
<p>This campaign will allow us to build out existing space, build a live-fire range for our classes, create a shoot house, expand our retail store, and begin the process of hiring 8 to 10 veterans for instructors, retail staff, and support personnel (all veterans).  We are opening the new facility on April 1st, 2015.</p>
<p>We will use the money for starting salaries of our new employees, sales and marketing efforts, new equipment, and insurance and license fees.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">License and insurance fees - $2,000</span><br/>
</li>
<li>New facility modifications and range - $10,000</li>
<li>Training materials and training equipment - $3,000</li> <li>Marketing - $5,000</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Payroll and expenses - $20,000</span><br/>
</li> </ul>
<div>For your generous contribution to our campaign, if you are in the Baltimore Maryland area, you can choose to attend our training facility or receive a personalized self-defense consultation in person.  If you are not able to come to our facility, we can arrange for your consultation over the phone or by video conference.  We will help you to build your personalized self-defense plan from the ground up and tailor it to meet your needs and budget.  All levels of contribution will include:</div>

<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">a personalized letter of thanks from our veterans;</span><br/>

</div>
</div><div> <p>Your contribution to our campaign will help veterans get back to work - or stay working.  We as Servicemembers need a purpose.  When our military purpose ends, the desire to serve does not end.  You will be a huge part in the lives of veterans and their families.  They need help... help us to help them.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There is very little competition in our area for the type of training we provide, but we will have a unique advantage of hiring seasoned combat veterans that served as military police and infantry Soldiers to bring real-world experiences to every class they teach.  They are no strangers to hard work, and will do what it takes to make sure each and every student is 100% satisfied with the training they receive.  In fact, it's guaranteed.  Any less than 100% customer satisfaction wouldn't be fair to our customers.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Please help us get the word out to help veterans and their families.  They served our country, now it's time for us to serve them.  I personally went into combat with an awful lot of Soldiers that I can't help with my existing business.  I need your help to grow and be able to hire them and give them a purpose again - a purpose of serving the people of this great country.</p>

What We Need & What You Get To expand our existing facility and hire more veterans, we're estimating the cost to be $40,000.  My wife and I are investing $15,000 of our own money, so that leaves $25,000 that we need from you to get us started.  Once operational, the business will be able to support our ongoing operations.  We just need a little help to get us going - we can take care of the rest.  
This campaign will allow us to build out existing space, build a live-fire range for our classes, create a shoot house, expand our retail store, and begin the process of hiring 8 to 10 veterans for instructors, retail staff, and support personnel (all veterans).  We are opening the new facility on April 1st, 2015.
We will use the money for starting salaries of our new employees, sales and marketing efforts, new equipment, and insurance and license fees.  


License and insurance fees - $2,000

New facility modifications and range - $10,000
Training materials and training equipment - $3,000 Marketing - $5,000

Payroll and expenses - $20,000
 
For your generous contribution to our campaign, if you are in the Baltimore Maryland area, you can choose to attend our training facility or receive a personalized self-defense consultation in person.  If you are not able to come to our facility, we can arrange for your consultation over the phone or by video conference.  We will help you to build your personalized self-defense plan from the ground up and tailor it to meet your needs and budget.  All levels of contribution will include:



a personalized letter of thanks from our veterans;


a certificate of appreciation;

listed on our supporter page (optional); and
our never-ending gratitude.

Feel free to browse the perks we have for you and choose the one that best fits your desired level of participation.


The Impact

 Your contribution to our campaign will help veterans get back to work - or stay working.  We as Servicemembers need a purpose.  When our military purpose ends, the desire to serve does not end.  You will be a huge part in the lives of veterans and their families.  They need help... help us to help them.   Risks & Challenges There is very little competition in our area for the type of training we provide, but we will have a unique advantage of hiring seasoned combat veterans that served as military police and infantry Soldiers to bring real-world experiences to every class they teach.  They are no strangers to hard work, and will do what it takes to make sure each and every student is 100% satisfied with the training they receive.  In fact, it's guaranteed.  Any less than 100% customer satisfaction wouldn't be fair to our customers.   Other Ways You Can Help Please help us get the word out to help veterans and their families.  They served our country, now it's time for us to serve them.  I personally went into combat with an awful lot of Soldiers that I can't help with my existing business.  I need your help to grow and be able to hire them and give them a purpose again - a purpose of serving the people of this great country.
Use the share tools that Indiegogo has to offer.  Post it to your Facebook page, Tweet about it, email it to your friends and family.  Help us to help Maryland Veterans!
Thank you for taking your valuable time to read our proposal.  We hope to be able to meet each and every one of you soon!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</blockquote><p><strong>HISTORICAL BACKDROP</strong></p><p></p><p>In
 the mid 1800’s William Leidesdorff Jr., a man of Caribbean and Danish 
decent made the voyage from the Port of New Orleans to Yerba Buena (what
 is now San Francisco) during the age of sail. Leidesdorff was said to 
have been the last black seaman to make that journey, since soon after, 
the Negro Seamen's Act of 1822 was put in place. Once he arrived on the 
California coast, he wasted no time in taking on entrepreneurial 
endeavors. One of which was his opening of the City Hotel. The City 
Hotel was the first hotel in the region and was in place in what is now 
San Francisco’s financial district until it was burned down in the fire 
of 1851. <br/></p><h3>Our hotel will <a href=""http://www.homagehotelgroup.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Pay Homage""</a> to the legacy of Mr. Leidesdorff who is considered to be the <a href=""http://firstblackmillionaire.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">first black millionaire in America</a>.<br/>
</h3><p><strong>WHATS ON THE HORIZON</strong><br/><br/>Homage
 Hotel Group is currently seeking funding for a full renovation project 
to include room interiors, themed restaurant, Lobby and Rooftop Bar as 
well as meetings and special event space. The locale for the project 
centers around Oakland, CA and the downtown city center. </p><p><br/>The property will pay Homage to
 the history of William Liedesdorff Jr. by incorporating elements of his
 storied past into the culture of the operation. Hotel culture will take
 on the personality of Mr. Liedesdorff who “bore a high reputation for 
integrity and enterprise” and is said to have been ""liberal, hospitable, cordial, confiding even to a fault.” <br/><br/><strong>PROJECTED FEATURES</strong><br/><br/><strong>Hortense/Julia Ann’s Restaurant- </strong>Hortense
 is the name of the woman, who by calling off their wedding mere days 
before, broke William’s heart to the point he felt he needed to leave 
New Orleans. Julia Ann is the name of the boat William purchased in 
order to set sail for the West. Though the name is up in the air, the 
creole inspired theme of the restaurant is solidified through the 
narrative. The interior will be a vintage and eclectic resemblance of a 
sailors tavern. The menu will feature an expansive raw bar as well as 
creole inspired main dishes while featuring Liedesdorff’s love of fine 
wines and cuisine. </p><p><strong>Schooner’s Roof Top Bar </strong>- A
 schooner is a type of sailing vessel with fore-and-aft sails on two or 
more masts and the very type of vessel William Liedesdorff Jr. used to 
make his voyage. The roof top will be Oakland's first and will feature elements that resemble a 
schooner ship while making special note of Liedesdorff’s love for 
landscaping as his estate featured one of the largest flower gardens in 
all of California. </p><h3><b>What We Need &amp; Why?</b></h3>Break it down for folks in more detail:<br/>We
 are seeking $10,000 to assist us in taking the next step to make our 
hotel a reality. Most of that amount will go towards the legal fees associated with crowd funding an entire hotel project. Our next step will be to take our project to the City of Oakland and generate yet another crowd funding campaign. Only this time it will be Equity based so that investors can make a return on their investment. The funds from that campaign will aid in the purchase and renovation of our hotel. <br/><br/>Your funds will directly aid in the following:<br/><br/><ol>
<li>Legal Counsel and Securities Attorney fees</li>
<li>Marketing Distribution Materials<br/>
</li>
<li>Collaborative Fundraising efforts</li>
<li>Groundbreaker.co Crowd Funding Software </li>
</ol><br/>We
 have some pretty cool perks available for our campaign however we’re only just asking people to donate 10 dollars. The way we see it if we 
can get 1000 people to do such we can reach our goal rather seamlessly.

This of course will slow down my veterans training program as there will not be funds to pay them a wage to live on and I will have to work more vets in as each house is sold.  As many of you already know, once you start pulling down walls and pulling apart kitchens and baths surprises always appear.  The donated funds are also for these unexpected expenses. I do have 30 years experience in management between military and civilian life, have started and helped my ex-wife run a successful business since 2003, which is still doing great to this day. I have flipped houses before and am familiar with the permitting and inspection code.Your donations will help me finally crawl out of my rut and also help our returning and current veterans who often feel lost and do not know how to get on with their lives. What is in it for you? The satisfaction and good feeling you get inside from knowing you helped make a difference in someones life. Kept them off the street and out of trouble. A contributing member of society.  When I used to teach kids martial arts and I was asked one day, if I got tired of putting so many hours into it because I was not making any money as most of the kids could not afford the tuition and were free,  I used to say, ""If we can save just one of these kids, it is worth it.""YOUR HELP!!Please help us today with your $1, $2, $5, $10, $25, $50, $75, $100, $200, $500, $1000 or more donation. Anything helps reach the goal!! Remember if you can not contribute but would like to help, share this campaign with your friends and family!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><p>Garden Station is a whimsical community garden, art park and
sustainable living education center in the heart of downtown Dayton, Ohio
created entirely by volunteers.</p>
<p>We feature sustainable buildings on pounded tire foundations
with straw bale, bottle wall and green roof. Local artists have created murals
to cover about 400' of wall as well as sculptures and mosaics. We have
wheelchair accessible garden plots and a market garden that grows produce for
our Sunday Market and seniors at Jaycee Towers. We have an outdoor kitchen for
events and classes and permaculture demonstration projects including a food
forest, herb spiral and hugelkultur swales. We also have helped establish an
urban farmer's group and ran a 23 week urban farmer's market the past 3 years,
as well as taught over 60 FREE sustainable living workshops every year.</p>
<p>Garden Station has been created by over 2000 volunteers and
donations from over 150 local businesses and organizations with no paid staff
or budget and truly represents the heart and soul of our community!</p>
<p>2013 was our first EarthFest. It started as a larger farmer’s
market with a non-Monsanto plant and seed sale and free workshops, and ended up
being an 8 hour long festival with about 1000 people attending 30+ workshops,
enjoying 6 local bands, vendors/info booths from 30 community organizations
with food trucks, the Really Really Free Market and the Great Cloth Diaper
Change to boot! Last year over 4000 people attended and over 80
organizations participated! EarthFest is now the LARGEST Earth Day event
in the Miami Valley!</p>
<p>The community was SO generous and raised about $2500 to put on
this amazing event plus groups donated the programs, posters, raffle prizes and
more! Over half of that money went towards advertising on WYSO, DMM and the
City Paper and $600 went to pay 6 local bands, plus we had some printing costs
for posters and signs and rented tents.</p>
<p>It would be nice to raise enough this year to pay our workshop
teachers a small stipend for supplies since they did it all as volunteers and
donated materials from their own pockets last year.</p>
<p>$30/ workshop x 30 workshops = $900</p>
<p>It would be great to have more tents and or heaters in case of
bad weather which can add up costs quickly. We would like to expand our advertising and we would  also like to videotape the
workshops to play on DATV so even more people can learn how to “go a shade
greener”! </p>

ups and downs, happiness and challenges but most importantly of all, like some
of you, we didn’t give up on our dreams. The harder it became, the bigger we
dreamt!!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are exactly like you or everyone else in the world - like most entrepreneurial
India stories – we are in our early/mid-thirties, we come from a middle class
background, have family &amp; kids. We typically hangout with like-minded friends
and unlike what happens in the real world, we solve the gravest of the world’s problem
over a peg. We believe, “To solve the problems always count on your spirit!!
(Pun intended), but again like everyone else our gutsy version of fighting
world’s worst nightmare bare knuckle, used to die right after the last peg or
probably when we used to wake up with hangover. </p>
<p>Everything was mundane, indifferent and constant when finally our moment
of calling had come. We then took the most impractical decision of our life.
After failing twice in our earlier ventures, we decided to give up on our
routine comfortable life that had more than decent fixed income just to follow
what world calls ‘living your dream’ and ‘following your passion’. </p>
Choose
what you may to define what we two lesser mortals did, but 24 months after we
took that plunge, life has changed for the better. We are living our dreams and
we are dreaming even bigger. <b>CityShor.com</b>, is not a dream anymore, it’s an

step to pursue your life’s calling. <div>
<br/><p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Little about our dream:</b></p>

<p>Like
everyone else and as lot of articles on internet suggested, we made business
plans, we estimated our revenues, and we crunched some numbers to show how many

But honestly nothing worked as per plan … our revenue sources went for a toss
completely but fortunately it turned out much better than our plans on paper.

CityShor is followed by more than 10% of local youth in Ahmedabad and we are
the Largest Online Media Company in Ahmedabad. Users just don’t like our
products but they love us (there are always few exceptions in life), worked
with more than 600+ retailers – they believe we are the most effective and only

<p>Few inside figures show us that our growth numbers are much better than
today’s some of the well known start-ups of India – if we compare their first
two years and ours. </p>
<p>Are we successful – yes we are. Are we happy? – Yes we are. But Are we
satisfied? – Nope. The appetite has grown, The resolve even stronger. </p>
After
two years, we have again dreamt of doing something huge. And with
this new dream, we wish to break all the world records. <p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Our new dream:</b></p>
<p>Today with just 10% of local youth following us, we are the largest media
company in Ahmedabad; however, we wish to grow more and want to break all the
world records. We wish 50% of local youth of Ahmedabad should know and get the
benefit of CityShor’s product. </p>
<p>Currently with more than 1,50,000 people (more than 10% of local youth on
Facebook) following us, we have radically change the way a local knows and
explores its city. Likewise, we have dramatically changed the way a small to
mid-size local retailer showcases its art and product to Ahmedabad. We make
local business feel like an MNC which would never have been possible without
CityShor. </p>
<p>Imagine how much we can change if we are able to take 1, 50, 000 to 6,
00, 000 – yes more than 50% of local youth on Facebook. </p>
<p>Exactly, that’s our new dream. To acquire more than 50% of local youth on
Facebook and break all the world records and we need your help for that. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Why should you care? </b></p>
<p>Why shouldn’t you? After all, you didn’t read all the above because it
was shit!!!  Now that we got your
attention, don’t shy away. Stick on and be a part of history. </p>
<p>Won’t you like to support a home grown company… a company which is
creating a history … 2 people … 2 laptops … no financial backing… already a
largest online media company in Ahmedabad… won’t you like to be a part of the
history. </p>

possible from you – Rs. 250/- , Rs. 500/- or anything. And if nothing else,
just share our video so that we can reach out to maximum possible people with
our pitch. </p>
<p>Wondering why do we need money… aren’t we earning? Well, read on…</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>What would we do with your
contribution / money?</b></p>
<p>Wondering why do we need money… aren’t we earning? Well, we are earning
and we are earning pretty decent. However, the kind of target and dream that we
have for us is pretty steep and huge. It requires huge number of team members,
lot of ground level activities, lot of feet on street exercise and basically
approaching huge masses of Ahmedabad … introducing them to what CityShor is and
finally convincing them to start following us. </p>
<p>You believe it’s a small task… well, it’s not. </p>
<p>This is the exact place where we are going to spend your money on.
Basically to build your own company, to reach to 50% of local youth.</p>

CityShor is followed by more than 10% of local youth in Ahmedabad and we are
the Largest Online Media Company in Ahmedabad. Users just don’t like our
products but they love us (there are always few exceptions in life), worked
with more than 600+ retailers – they believe we are the most effective and only
possible medium to increase their business. 
Few User Testimonials:
 




Success Stories of local businesses:






Few inside figures show us that our growth numbers are much better than
today’s some of the well known start-ups of India – if we compare their first
two years and ours. 
Are we successful – yes we are. Are we happy? – Yes we are. But Are we
satisfied? – Nope. The appetite has grown, The resolve even stronger. 
After
two years, we have again dreamt of doing something huge. And with
this new dream, we wish to break all the world records. 


Our new dream:
Today with just 10% of local youth following us, we are the largest media
company in Ahmedabad; however, we wish to grow more and want to break all the
world records. We wish 50% of local youth of Ahmedabad should know and get the
benefit of CityShor’s product. 
Currently with more than 1,50,000 people (more than 10% of local youth on
Facebook) following us, we have radically change the way a local knows and
explores its city. Likewise, we have dramatically changed the way a small to
mid-size local retailer showcases its art and product to Ahmedabad. We make
local business feel like an MNC which would never have been possible without
CityShor. 
Imagine how much we can change if we are able to take 1, 50, 000 to 6,
00, 000 – yes more than 50% of local youth on Facebook. 
Exactly, that’s our new dream. To acquire more than 50% of local youth on
Facebook and break all the world records and we need your help for that. 

Why should you care? 
Why shouldn’t you? After all, you didn’t read all the above because it
was shit!!!  Now that we got your
attention, don’t shy away. Stick on and be a part of history. 
Won’t you like to support a home grown company… a company which is
creating a history … 2 people … 2 laptops … no financial backing… already a
largest online media company in Ahmedabad… won’t you like to be a part of the
history. 
Well, if the above logic is still not convincing, please know that for
whatever contribution you make, we will gift you something back which is of
equal or higher amount. Please check out right hand side of this page for
different perks that we have on offer for you.
And we are not asking world from you. We are fine with whatever is
possible from you – Rs. 250/- , Rs. 500/- or anything. And if nothing else,
just share our video so that we can reach out to maximum possible people with
our pitch. 
Wondering why do we need money… aren’t we earning? Well, read on…

What would we do with your
contribution / money?
Wondering why do we need money… aren’t we earning? Well, we are earning
and we are earning pretty decent. However, the kind of target and dream that we
have for us is pretty steep and huge. It requires huge number of team members,
lot of ground level activities, lot of feet on street exercise and basically
approaching huge masses of Ahmedabad … introducing them to what CityShor is and
finally convincing them to start following us. 
You believe it’s a small task… well, it’s not. 
This is the exact place where we are going to spend your money on.
Basically to build your own company, to reach to 50% of local youth.

<h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
<div>
<p>Our development team has plenty of experience in connecting different web sites. We will start with Facebook, Couchsurfing, BeWelcome, Trustroots, Twitter, and MeetUp. Once you sign up you will be able to see already several resources to build up a very useful and effective profile, resources to connect to your couch surfing friends, and plenty of instructions on how to use the resources of the new web site.</p>
<p>You will then be able to communicate with other members using our discussion groups, search for accommodations if you are planning a trip, and find events at any location you want.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<p></p>
</div>
<div><h3>RESOURCEFUL, EASY, AND AD-FREE</h3></div>
<div>
<p>We like simple and modern user interfaces. The web page will work flawlessly on any browser, and in any platform. Even on smartphones and tablets it should present without a problem.</p>
<p>In a second phase we will be building the Apps for iPhones and Androids.</p>
<p><b>We are not considering advertising as a source of revenue.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>ALL FEATURES AVAILABLE FOR FREE</h3>
<p></p>
<p>There will be no features that you have to pay for. Every improvement and resource will be available for everyone. No advertising means that we will be able to stay neutral and never mislead our couch surfers either by pushing a product or service that is not the best, or by omission. We will allow users to make recommendations of products of services they like, or list services they recommend. But there will be very clear guidelines for that, and a watchful community that doesn't want to see yet another great site be invaded by SPAM. </p>
<p>All the money to run everything will come from donations and crowfunding. Just like Wikipedia and some other web sites do. They are community resources, so they live out of the generosity of those that can afford more.</p>
<p>We believe that people from a poor country, where a few dollars can make a big difference, should not be barred from using the services of Hospitality Gift because they can't afford a ""verification"" fee, or pay for premium services, or because they don't have a credit card to sign up.</p>

<h3>WHAT WE HAVE NOW</h3>
<p>We have a core team of developers, ready to start. We have access to powerful hi-capacity servers that should allow us to run tests and accept several thousand users without slowing down the site. We also have access to databases and cloud storage enough for development and testing.</p>

In all my years of consulting faith-based content creators, the thing that frustrated me the most was that my clients were unintentionally creating life-changing content with limits. Primarily, only their congregations, partners and supporters would access it. In order to enjoy these ""gifts"", you had to attend the events or buy their products at these events. If you lived across country and had the good fortune to hear about this ministry, or if you wanted to share content with a friend, you either mailed them CDs and DVDs via snail mail or were at the mercy of the beasts that are mass video platforms to find their content. 

Access and brand awareness are issues for established and upcoming Christian influencers across the board. Whether you are an established ministry, clean comedian, filmmaker, musician, evangelist or entertainer, existing broadcast mediums are either relatively limited or are not focused on offering a portal that is dedicated to the community of faith. 

At MyWordCentral, distribution of Faith-Based content is our only focus. With your help, we will change the way Christian content is consumed for years to come! 

The problem with current video content platforms:

Millions of irrelevant and distracting video content make finding enriching and uplifting content difficult.
Lacks a true focus of enriching and transforming people
Old process that lacks the intelligence to provide personally-progressive content.

There is a solution to these problems and the answer is MyWordCentral: 
A faith-based OTT (Over the Top) video platform created to organize and provide access to premium content on life, love and family.

MyWordCentral exists to:

Capture and organize all of the faith-based content scattered around the web
Curate premium content from content creators for streaming, renting and downloading (ownership) by the faith-based community 


Offer content that is fulfilling and faith-driven
Provide a family friendly experience
Develop the content to be accessible through multiple means of consumption









The Goals
Our goal is to raise at least $5,000 to build the 1st version, or beta as many would call it, of MyWordCentral. We want to bring great content to every screen and to do that we'll need your help. In the faith community, we want YOU to walk with us through this journey and truly know that you had a hand in the creation and launch of MyWordCentral.

Realizing that we can't do this on our own, we contracted an impressive group of engineers, designers and marketing experts that are creating a preliminary version product. Working with the team described below will ensure that we get off to a strong start. They have ample experience in delivering quality products and understand the audience and the problems.

That's a fancy way of saying they design and build applications and so far they've completed products for an impressive roster! Check out some of their clients below. Or on their website.





Inflex Digital is a digital first marketing and strategic insights consultancy located in Atlanta, Georgia. I met Justin, founder of Inflex Digital, after watching him discuss the future of media on TV One's NewsOne Now with Roland Martin! After a few conversations and the opportunity to meet the team I knew that this was the team to help us launch the vision placed on my heart!





The Product Rewards
As part of our fundraiser we decided the best reward would be the product itself. Initially priced at just $3.99 per month we believe organizing the Internet's Faith-based content is worth every penny. However, we know you want more, and so do we! We'll deliver premium content from our content creators, as well as develop  original MyWordCentral produced content. The more we deliver to you what you want, the better you respond to it, the more we can do. 
With that said, we are offering great incentive for you to support us early! 




Stretch Goals
Whether it's to offer you supplemental content for your personal journey or simply better options for your family, we believe MyWordCentral will be the premiere destination to consume Faith-based content. With this in mind, we created stretch goals that will enable us to integrate more content and features into our desktop and mobile products. Let's see how far we can go!

With more, we can do more!

Having transcripts also has a great advantage of reading it anytime and anywhere, like while waiting for the train! We live in a fast-paced society. It is probably difficult to spare 30 minutes of your time to watch a great video when you are busy, however you can easily make time for 5 minutes to read the transcripts.

<p>GUUTEX is operated by three Japanese guys who met in Singapore. In Japan media websites which provide transcripts are getting very popular, but there is no similar service outside of Japan. We have analyzed the qualities of users, such as average session duration and bounce rate, and it was revealed that there was no significant difference between English users and Japanese users. The population of English-speaking country is more than 10 times larger than that of Japan. We believe the PV in English-speaking country would be over 20 milion PV per month. There is a huge potential in the English market and it our aim to be the best transcript media provider in the world.</p>

</h3><p>about I AM HERD ...<br/></p><div>
<h3>
</h3>
<h3>
<i><strong><h3>
I AM HERD (non-profit) is a herd of (formerly) wild horses + one girl (MMJ) on a mission to help others ""hear their own heart"".
</h3></strong></i>
</h3>
<i><em><strong></strong></em></i>
<p><em>Many individuals have lost their innate ability to hear their own heart. Bullying, depression, grief, illness and many other life happenings can cause our heart's voice to become faint as our issues become magnified. <br/></em></p>
<p><em>I AM HERD puts a microphone to the heart, to your heart. When the light of the heart is turned on, the darkness flees.<br/></em></p>
<p><em>Wild Mustang horses represent strength, freedom and pure heart across many cultures. The I AM HERD team consists of 7 Mustangs, all born in the wild, once unwanted and unheard. They are now the voice and visual of I AM HERD. The Mustangs and MMJ desire to inspire YOU to hear your own heart.<br/></em></p>
<em>I AM HERD travels to offer messages for Anti-Bullying Campaigns, Programs for 'At Risk' Children, Schools, Churches, Orphanages, Youth Groups &amp; more.</em> <br/><br/>In the message the audience is engaged by the Herd in a memorizing style that only majestic Mustang horses can create. Their 2-legged herd-mate (Mary Miller-Jordan) puts their message to words - together they paint an emotion of motivation &amp; triumph in the spectators, guiding them to hear their own hearts. These are called Mustang Messages and they are the heart beat of I AM HERD.<br/><br/>Our goal is to expand the funding of I AM HERD in order to travel to more locations, create videos, books and other motivational material to inspire more individuals to hear their own heart. <em>This is why we choose to become a Non profit in 2015.<br/><br/>We have our first large event planned for Oct. 31st. 2015 in Lumberton, NC. We would like to invite everyone to attend - for FREE, but there are some costs involved to make this happen. We are kicking off this fundraiser with the goal of funding the Oct. 31st event, any additional funding will go to I AM HERD programs for 2016. <br/></em>

<p>THANK YOU from the depth of our souls for reading this and taking interest in our passion - HEAR YOUR OWN HEART!<br/></p>I AM HERD, Mary Miller-Jordan &amp; the Mustangs<br/>
</div></div>","My name is Mary Miller-Jordan (MMJ) and I am so thankful YOU are interested in the mission of my non-profit I AM HERD!
The purpose of this campaign is to fund our Oct. 31st I AM HERD event so that spectators can attend for FREE, as well as give I AM HERD a jump start for our 2016 programs!
about I AM HERD ...




I AM HERD (non-profit) is a herd of (formerly) wild horses + one girl (MMJ) on a mission to help others ""hear their own heart"".



Many individuals have lost their innate ability to hear their own heart. Bullying, depression, grief, illness and many other life happenings can cause our heart's voice to become faint as our issues become magnified. 
I AM HERD puts a microphone to the heart, to your heart. When the light of the heart is turned on, the darkness flees.
Wild Mustang horses represent strength, freedom and pure heart across many cultures. The I AM HERD team consists of 7 Mustangs, all born in the wild, once unwanted and unheard. They are now the voice and visual of I AM HERD. The Mustangs and MMJ desire to inspire YOU to hear your own heart.
I AM HERD travels to offer messages for Anti-Bullying Campaigns, Programs for 'At Risk' Children, Schools, Churches, Orphanages, Youth Groups & more. In the message the audience is engaged by the Herd in a memorizing style that only majestic Mustang horses can create. Their 2-legged herd-mate (Mary Miller-Jordan) puts their message to words - together they paint an emotion of motivation & triumph in the spectators, guiding them to hear their own hearts. These are called Mustang Messages and they are the heart beat of I AM HERD.Our goal is to expand the funding of I AM HERD in order to travel to more locations, create videos, books and other motivational material to inspire more individuals to hear their own heart. This is why we choose to become a Non profit in 2015.We have our first large event planned for Oct. 31st. 2015 in Lumberton, NC. We would like to invite everyone to attend - for FREE, but there are some costs involved to make this happen. We are kicking off this fundraiser with the goal of funding the Oct. 31st event, any additional funding will go to I AM HERD programs for 2016. 
  Share & Care - we will not leave your hands Bare :-)

Who are the people behind BOHO?

Niklas, Philipp
and our team are the people responsible for BOHO. 
Niklas brought the project to
life at the beginning of the year 2014 with his vision of a living curtain. At that
time the name BOTANIC HORIZON had not yet come into being. 
Philipp joined the
team in April 2014. He ensures that our prototypes are transformed into working
systems. 
Our dedicated team works to turn new ideas into new products.


All of our BOHO Systems are handcrafted - designed and manufactured in Erzgebirge (Germany)

<p><br/></p>Hello there, Alder here
<div>
<p>I am an artist, and a furry. I have been an artist since I was about 6, and as I grew up I found that art was insanely expensive and that always bothered me. But I kept working on making art, simply for the love of creating. When I got older I found sculpting though and fell in love with working with my hands. </p>
<p>When I got even older I discovered sex, and all of the fun things that came with it, but at the prices my jaw dropped in astonishment. Everything was so expensive. But at the time I thought it was simply must cost a lot to make them. </p>
<p>later still in life I found myself once again browsing though the catalog of a rather well-known furry sex toy maker, finding myself annoyed at the prices once again. Thinking to myself ""gods, I wish I knew how to make this stuff"" when it finally hit me, why don't I teach myself how to do it? And, with a grin of defiance to the difficulties, I started.</p>
<p>A year later I find myself on the cusp of being able to publicly release my pieces to those who would want them. But I need one more financial push at allow me to extend my line, as well as keep up with a flood of demand that seems to be at the gates. And, you're push can help me open those gates. </p>

<h3>What it all goes to.</h3>
<div>
<p>the bulk of all the money that I get will go to purchasing pottery clay, latex, and silicone. Though some of it will also being going to clay that does not dry. That is for making practice sculpts. a sketch book for drawing up concepts, and last, but certainly not least, the stuff to build vacuum chambers.</p>
<p>Now at some point you may, of course, ask about the difference between me and other companies, and that is a very valid question. The primary difference is that I am going to be offering custom pieces. In other words, I will be taking commissions to making toys to look exactly as wanted to the best of my abilities. Starting from a concept sketch all the way to a silicone piece. </p>
<p>This is a very good way to get a piece made specifically for your personal character (fursona or otherwise), to the point of even getting your piece as a single make. Meaning there will be no copies made of your piece and you alone will have this unique piece. </p>
<p>Lastly funding will also help me with further testing, to be able to make more than the basic toys. I want to be able to offer a vibrating option for each of the pieces, as well as turning them into wearable sheaths. Even such aspiration to making flesh lights, and more. Though those are far down the road. </p>
<p>Even if I don't reach my entire goal, all of the money will go to buying products so that I can make custom pieces, and be ready to sell silicone pieces as they are ordered. Though it will be to a much lesser extent and progressing as well as building new products will take longer.</p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The funds raised by this campaign will be used to establish the Los Angeles
Community Center for Autistic Adults (LACCAA), which will provide valuable array
of services for autistic adults, many of whom currently lack any available
support.</p>
<p>Funds will initially be used to establish a non-profit organization, with any
remaining funds being donated to this organization for the purposes of
establishing a community center, staffing, and development of services for the
adult autistic community.</p>
<p><b>Autistic Adults</b></p>
<p>Many services are available to autistic children and their parents, as well
as transitional services for young adults who have been previously
diagnosed.  However, there is little
available for autistic adults, especially those who received a diagnosis later
in life or are self-diagnosed.</p>
<p>In the next decade, it is estimated that 800,000 autistic children will
enter adulthood.  Increasing awareness
and early diagnosis of autism have helped provide better support for these
individuals and their families.  Unfortunately, previous generations did not have the benefit of widespread autism awareness:
those 20-60 years of age amount to four decades of autistic adults, or over 3 million
people with limited or no support for their condition.</p>
<p>Autism’s challenges do not end with childhood, but rather we face a whole
new set of challenges, and often without the same support mechanisms that were
available to us as children, including the safety of family.  While we continue to grow and adapt, many of
us face challenges throughout our lives, such as finding employment, developing
personal relationships, and independent living.</p>
<p><b>Offering a Solution</b></p>
<p>The Los Angeles Community Center for Autistic Adults will offer a variety of
services for autistic adults, including:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Professional diagnostic services<br/><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Individual counseling<br/><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Evaluate individuals to determine their unique
challenges and develop solutions<br/><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Vocational programs to help align career goals
and find employment<br/><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Job coaching to provide support in
coping with and resolving vocational issues<br/><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Mentoring and life coaching<br/><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Refinement of social skills through engaging
social events</p>
<p>LACCAA will be unique in that it will be a charity based solution that is
driven from within the autistic community, and will employ autistic
individuals, including on its board of directors.</p>
<p><b>About Myself</b></p>
<p>Hello, my
name is Robert Dunlop.<span>  I have always
known that I was different, but until I was diagnosed in 2003 with Asperger’s
Syndrome at the age of 33 I did not know why. 
As so many individuals that I have met through my meetup group have told
me, suddenly “it all made sense”.</span></p>
<p>I have
faced many challenges in my life, in part due to my difficulties in dealing
with a traditional workplace.<span> 
Fortunately I have the skills and entrepreneurial drive to build my own
opportunities, and started my first business at the age of 16, selling computer
accessories to fellow students and the computer science department at my high
school.</span></p>
<p>Four years
ago I became involved with a local meetup.com group for adults on the autistic
spectrum, and over one year ago I began hosting my own meetup in the San
Fernando Valley.<span>  Meeting other autistic
adults has been a very rewarding experience, but it has also served to make me
aware of the needs of this community, and how much more could be done.</span></p>
<p>Help me
make LACCAA a reality!<span>  </span></p>

About Myself
Hello, my
name is Robert Dunlop.  I have always
known that I was different, but until I was diagnosed in 2003 with Asperger’s
Syndrome at the age of 33 I did not know why. 
As so many individuals that I have met through my meetup group have told
me, suddenly “it all made sense”.
I have
faced many challenges in my life, in part due to my difficulties in dealing
with a traditional workplace. 
Fortunately I have the skills and entrepreneurial drive to build my own
opportunities, and started my first business at the age of 16, selling computer
accessories to fellow students and the computer science department at my high
school.
Four years
ago I became involved with a local meetup.com group for adults on the autistic
spectrum, and over one year ago I began hosting my own meetup in the San
Fernando Valley.  Meeting other autistic
adults has been a very rewarding experience, but it has also served to make me
aware of the needs of this community, and how much more could be done.
Help me
make LACCAA a reality!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

We are so lucky to have grown so quickly, consistently receiving such wonderful feedback and support from our brides and peers in the wedding industry. Orders are now being shipped as far as Hawaii and Canada however we have reached a point where as a small business we can no longer grow to our full potential.

National and Trade Shows cost an average of £4000 per show plus you need to have a significant number of sample stock in place requiring many extra hours of work as well as plenty of high quality materials for which we currently don't have the capacity to produce.
Further growth is only possible by putting the right support in place. We will be able to fulfil those and many more orders, develop new designs, exhibit at both the Trade and National Wedding shows (thus shipping our handmade designs nationwide in shops) and of course hire more people to support this growth and expansion to the next level.

   What We Need & What You Get  
We are aiming to achieve £15000 that will go to the various targets outlined below. We have broken everything down so you can clearly see what your contribution will help achieve and can choose as many mini or mega perks as you like, depending on which Angel you want to become. Full perk details are on the right.

£120 Emerald Angel (buys a small advert in a wedding magazine)

£200 Ruby Angel (buys allocated hours for part time staff)

***For every £3000 raised we will be giving away a free wedding bouquet to a disadvantaged bride.


If we achieve any less than our target you will still receive the perks for your specific pledge for we believe no contribution is too small and we honour you. Your pledges mean that when we grow others will grow too.







The Impact

By supporting us to get to our goal you will be supporting so many more people beyond us as well as allowing us to produce high quality handmade pieces locally here in Oxford that can then be exported both nationally and globally. We are passionate in keeping all things handmade and never mass produced. 
Your contribution will allow us to grow the business to the next level which is currently not possible. We have been shown time and time again that there is great demand for quality handmade alternative wedding related designs to be available to the public both nationwide and globally and with your help we can really make this happen. You will become an integral part of this story.




We will be able to create jobs by hiring people part time to help us bead.
We will be ordering more brooches, crystals etc. from local small suppliers thus enabling their small businesses to flourish.
We will be able to exhibit at the Trade Show, offering bridal shops a chance to stock unique hand made products rather than just mass-produced items. 
We will be able to exhibit at the big National Wedding Show to create more global brand awareness and create new designs.
You will be part of a multi-award winning company receiving some incredible perks and will actively witness how paying it forward helps more than one small business thrive.
For every £3000 raised we will be designing a bouquet for a disadvantaged bride. 




   Risks & Challenges We really want to produce more high quality pieces all handmade here in the UK to be available to both a national and international market. The only risk we anticipate is that if we don't achieve full funding we simply won't be able to achieve everything outlined above but we will work very hard with whatever we raise and simply grow at the pace given that's all.




   Other Ways You Can Help We totally understand that some of you will absolutely love all of this but won't be able to contribute financially at this stage but this doesn't mean you can't help, in fact you are invaluable. Here is how you can help:

I've started TinyPinc - a brand I've established since early 2010 during my college days.I've always loved all things tiny and small, and not to mention handmade has been a huge thing in my life since young...
I've been working in agencies as a Multimedia / Graphic Designer over the years after graduating. Along the sleepless nights of college and work I still maintained TinyPinc as a hobby...Now I've finally gone full scale on my hobby and I would LOVE to run it as my career! 
You can find me here: Facebook: www.facebook.com/tinypinc Etsy          : www.tinypinc.etsy.com


_________________________________________________

A little walkthrough on what I make

One of my favs, miniature popcorn :) Miniature lollipop necklace, anyone?

Oreos on necklaces!



____________________________________So, what sort of help you need here?

I basically work on TinyPinc alone. I sculpt miniatures > designing packagings > preparing packagings > packing orders > pictures > posting parcels > tracking > PR > to just everything.That is pretty hectic, and with better funds, I can get die-cut machines, better laptop, even a better workstation to help me speed up the process of everything! 





Further details on why do I need to be funded



 It's time to revamp and upscale my brand!   Funded funds will be used for better material sourcing = better quality goods!Materials like surgical steel necklaces for sensitive skin, and better assurance of safety to wear my miniatures. Better packaging (Who doesn't like pretty packaging?)  And not to mention, better and bigger workspace! 
Machines. Die-cut machines to make my own packaging. Yes I design my own packagings.  
What will I do with extra funds?-They will be used to assist my future projects (More on material sourcing!)
   How is this going to change my life This is going to be a huge help to speed things up while producing a whole line of handmade miniatures!  Organized workspace = efficiency 
Better quality products = trusts built with clients

There are so much more I would LOVE to make and complete but I'm bounded by the funds I have. 
With better tools, machines, packaging and materials, TinyPinc has a chance to be revamped into a better handmade brand and I need your help much!

</p><p>As many of you know the bakery in
Upper Jay has been sitting empty for a while now. I am now in the process of
gathering the funds to purchase it, I figured I would start with crowd sourcing
and see what comes of it. I was raised in Upper Jay, it kills me every time I
drive down the river front and see all the blank spaces where homes used to be,
and it’s a shame that the bakery is just sitting empty. The plans for the
property would revolve around the bakery, which I would hand over for my mother
to run (most of you know she is an amazing chef, baker, and just all around
culinary master). The rest of the property would be used for multiple purposes,
the end result being that there is one less empty building in town, and maybe
the chance to create one or two full time jobs, that we all know are needed in
this area and not just seasonal they would be year round. It may take time to
get to the point where these jobs would be open; we will need to build up a
base of local support first. The previous owner had local support, but hours
were so speratic, and the bakery was closed on high traffic days, so we will
need to get people in the community used to it being open more than just 2 or 3
days. This will also give us a chance to draw the tourist back into the town,
as all of us from the area know, the skiers, fishermen, bicyclist, and outdoors
people, are the ones that keep the area alive. To go with that I would also
like to use the main house for a vacation rental, to give people yet another
great option for staying in this great little town. With the opening of a few
local businesses of late, I would also like to support them by trying to keep
as much of the products sold local, aka local cheese, coffee, meats, vegetables,
and if we can get the licensing local beers. This area used to be a vibrant community;
I would be honored to be able to be part of helping it rebound.</p><p>This property would also be used for summer employment of at risk youths. Too many times these kids fall through the cracks and get into trouble, so over the summer we would like to be able to hire 1 or 2 kids. During their time working they would learn life skills, over the last 20+ years my parents have been doing therapeutic foster care, this is just the next step we would like to take. The work would not just be in the bakery, if the kids want they can learn about carpentry, agriculture at the local high tunnel, and social skills. In the next few weeks I will be talking to a few of the local agencies to see how we can make this happen, from who in their programs might be a good fit to what we will need to put into play for safety and insurance.<br/></p>
<p>I am looking to raise $300,000.00
to get this project started and get the bakery back up and running as soon as
possible. The money would go towards purchasing the property, stock, minor
repairs, and just general start up capital. No matter how much money is raised I will be moving forward to make this happen, that being said the more that is raised the less start up overhead will be a factor, and the sooner we can start the at risk youth program.  Any and all donations toward this
cause will be greatly appreciated; if the goal is not reached I will be going
to the office of Essex county small business for help and guidance in where to
go for the remaining funds. Once the property is purchased I would like to do a
community dinner free of charge, to thank everyone, details of this will be put
on the Jay Community News, Facebook, Email, and word of mouth. Thank you everyone
even for taking the time to read this, and special thanks to those who help
this dream come true.</p>

(independently verified as the coolest shop most people have ever been 
in.*)  If you require further credentials, I will humbly inform you that I have just claimed my 28th consecutive employee of the month award.<br/><br/>When I set out to start this thing I call a secondhand 
emporium, in hindsight, I was not completely prepared for some of the 
challenges. (For example, one important thing I didn't realize, was that 
putting two boxes of stuff in close proximity to each other ... would 
result in them actually multiplying on their own.) My goal has always been to one hundred percent curate the contents of 
this shop, and I've gotten a lot of the way there. After roughly two and
 a half years, I am at a point at which I know better what needs to go, 
what 
needs to stay, and what needs to be re-fangled to make my vision a 
reality. But I need your help.<br/><br/>This year I have had to go through an unplanned name change, which set things back a bit in terms of gaining traction and awareness of the shop.  With the current situation, our budget for advertising is hovering just above zero. Traditional advertising is expensive, and in order to get the customer traffic to create 
the sales to pay for the advertising, well you can see the ironic cycle. Business is slow as it is everywhere, but we don't want to completely lose momentum of what has been started. I've recently been spending excessive time and effort selling online, to make up for slow foot traffic and pay the bills, but that can make me feel like I'm neglecting the shop. Essentially, part of this campaign is to bring the shop to you here... help us move some stuff!<br/><p></p>

</div> <div> <h3>Big Words and Talking Points</h3>
<p>We are hopeful of enlisting your assistance in this unprecedented transmogrification of the entity now known as Old &amp; 
Fangled Secondhand Emporium.<br/></p> <ul> <li>The initial round of contributions is meant to create an increased positive cash flow that will give us the financial breathing room to allow us to proceed with implementing improvements in the shop. The two things we are always in need of are time and money. Your contribution = money, which, in a happy coincidence, buys us time. We have professionally produced a flashy graph, precisely illustrating these effects more clearly:<br/>

<br/><ul> <li>In exchange for your support, we have come up with several unique and exciting rewards, ranging from discounts and gift coins, mystery items, and fun events you can take part in, to popular favorites like Tee-Shirts, as well as bundles combining perks from several levels. Be sure to peruse them all, and don't be afraid to scoop some up for any of your relatives that might not know how to work the internets.</li>

<ul> <li>Our campaign is set up to receive flexible funding, because even if we don't reach our goal numbers, every bit helps us toward meeting our 
expenses and our goal of clearing space, plus every share gets a view by new potential 
customers. <br/>
</li>
<li>It turns out will be able to get reward items out to those supporters that use PayPal earlier in the campaign, as those funds are disbursed quickest. <br/>

familiar faces to out-of-towners who just happen across Old &amp; 
Fangled, over and over I hear how much people enjoy it and appreciate what I am doing. I want to do it better. Moving inventory and creating cash flow won't just keep us in business, it will allow us to address most if not all of the improvements on our to-do-list.<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Clearing out and upgrading the garage I am now using for haphazard storage, in order that it can be utilized as a workshop space and permanent annex/outlet shop. Remember, selecting mystery item perks helps us make space!</li>
<li>I love volunteers, but actually being able to pay an employee or two would be a great benefit of increased funds, allowing me to concentrate less on the routine tasks and focus on the big picture</li>
<li>A dedicated gallery space in the shop to display recycled, upcycled, 
refangled, altered, and improved art, sculpture, and clothing ... we 
intend to showcase the talent of local and regional artists<br/>

<li>New outdoor signage that works with the remodeled exterior of our building</li>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>More Words about Future Thingys &amp; Stuff<br/>
</h3>
<ul> <li>If we don't meet our goal, though we will still face challenges, any amount received will help us in our ongoing business. We are all set to fulfill all rewards, whether 2 or 20000.<br/>
</li>
<li>Meeting our goal amount will get us back to where we want to be for the foreseeable future, exceeding it by any amount will increase our ability to keep providing and improving on the unique experience that is Old &amp; Fangled. Greatly exceeding the goal allow me to actually bring in more help and really bring things to the next level. <br/>

<li>Any share to friends and family will increase visibility of the campaign, via word of mouth or social media: Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest, Myspace, Google Plus, LinkedIn, Friendster, Bridge Clubs, AOL chatrooms, etc. </li>
<li>Stop in and buy yourself something unique and awesome.<br/>

Not that we'd judge you about your coffee drinking habits. Maybe a mid-range national chain coffee, but also I suppose you have to take into account which size you order. Then again, how many days worth are we talking about, actually? Now that I think about it maybe we should re-examine the whole thing. I'm not asking you to give up your coffee, either.

Essentially, part of this campaign is to bring the shop to you here... help us move some stuff!
                                          
  Big Words and Talking Points
We are hopeful of enlisting your assistance in this unprecedented transmogrification of the entity now known as Old & 
Fangled Secondhand Emporium.  The initial round of contributions is meant to create an increased positive cash flow that will give us the financial breathing room to allow us to proceed with implementing improvements in the shop. The two things we are always in need of are time and money. Your contribution = money, which, in a happy coincidence, buys us time. We have professionally produced a flashy graph, precisely illustrating these effects more clearly:


                                   
 In exchange for your support, we have come up with several unique and exciting rewards, ranging from discounts and gift coins, mystery items, and fun events you can take part in, to popular favorites like Tee-Shirts, as well as bundles combining perks from several levels. Be sure to peruse them all, and don't be afraid to scoop some up for any of your relatives that might not know how to work the internets.


                                
 Our campaign is set up to receive flexible funding, because even if we don't reach our goal numbers, every bit helps us toward meeting our 
expenses and our goal of clearing space, plus every share gets a view by new potential 
customers. 

It turns out will be able to get reward items out to those supporters that use PayPal earlier in the campaign, as those funds are disbursed quickest. 






 Universally, people seem to love the shop. From repeat customers and 
familiar faces to out-of-towners who just happen across Old & 
Fangled, over and over I hear how much people enjoy it and appreciate what I am doing. I want to do it better. Moving inventory and creating cash flow won't just keep us in business, it will allow us to address most if not all of the improvements on our to-do-list. 
Clearing out and upgrading the garage I am now using for haphazard storage, in order that it can be utilized as a workshop space and permanent annex/outlet shop. Remember, selecting mystery item perks helps us make space!
I love volunteers, but actually being able to pay an employee or two would be a great benefit of increased funds, allowing me to concentrate less on the routine tasks and focus on the big picture
A dedicated gallery space in the shop to display recycled, upcycled, 
refangled, altered, and improved art, sculpture, and clothing ... we 
intend to showcase the talent of local and regional artists

New outdoor signage that works with the remodeled exterior of our building








Increased advertising budget

We have a web site, though it is bare bones at the moment. A successful campaign will allow us to build a full featured online showcase of what Old & Fangled has to offer.




                    
    More Words about Future Thingys & Stuff

 If we don't meet our goal, though we will still face challenges, any amount received will help us in our ongoing business. We are all set to fulfill all rewards, whether 2 or 20000.

Meeting our goal amount will get us back to where we want to be for the foreseeable future, exceeding it by any amount will increase our ability to keep providing and improving on the unique experience that is Old & Fangled. Greatly exceeding the goal allow me to actually bring in more help and really bring things to the next level. 
    Other Ways You (and your friends, and their friends) Can Help We understand some people just can't contribute, but there are other ways you can help this campaign, and our shop, immensely:  Use the Indiegogo share tools!
Any share to friends and family will increase visibility of the campaign, via word of mouth or social media: Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest, Myspace, Google Plus, LinkedIn, Friendster, Bridge Clubs, AOL chatrooms, etc. 
Stop in and buy yourself something unique and awesome.

We love volunteers!
Did I mention, SHARE!!! Bulletin boards, user groups, online forums, casual gatherings, whatever you can do ... it all helps.
   Thanks.

                                         Won't you help Mr. Doggie, by giving him a loving new home? For a simple contribution, less than the price of a cup of coffee each day. Well, unless you drink the really cheap coffee, in which case maybe a little bit more. Not that we'd judge you about your coffee drinking habits. Maybe a mid-range national chain coffee, but also I suppose you have to take into account which size you order. Then again, how many days worth are we talking about, actually? Now that I think about it maybe we should re-examine the whole thing. I'm not asking you to give up your coffee, either. I know I sure as hell wouldn't. Anyway, the point I think was that it's not much money.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I love to train hard and I am very competitive. The idea of competing gets me fired up and gets me through tough workouts!</p>
<p>I moved to Minneapolis immediately after graduating high school to pursue bodybuilding full time.

main objective. Why Will Thales Bank engage in Social Impact
Activities?
There are nearly 1 billion
     hungry people in the world. 

Nearly 21,000 children under
     the age of 5 died every day. 
The highest rates of child
     mortality are in sub-Saharan Africa, where 1 in 8 children die before the
     age of 5 - a rate more than 17 times the average for developed regions. 
More than 750 million people
     do not have sustainable access to safe drinking water. 
another 2.5 billion lack
     access to improved sanitation facilities.
While
mainstream banks are in most cases focused solely on the principle of profit maximization,
THALES BANK will implement the triple principle of profit-people-planet.THALES BANK will
focus on investing in African communities, providing opportunities for the most
disadvantaged, and supporting social, environmental, and ethical agendas. Our
lending practices will produce a better quality of life for the greatest possible
amount of people in Africa, and whose effects endure over time and continue to
produce a multiplicity of positive effects long after the initial investment is
made. We will:
use the power of
     Internet and smartphones to develop new forms of banking that will be guided by solidarity, Transparency and responsibility
     in the 55 countries of Africa.

 of African entrepreneurs do not know about Bank instruments like Bank 
Guarantees (BG’s), Standby Letters of Credit (SBLC), Medium Term Notes 
(MTN’s), or other Bank instruments. Because they are issued by European 
banks mostly.Unlike traditional letter of credit, a bank instrument is 
where the beneficiary obtains payment against papers demonstrating 
delivery. The important part is that bank instrument leasing makes it 
possible to use a small amount of capital to attain a large amount of 
capital for a period of time.We will develop relationships with

What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:  Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.  Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited! Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.    The Impact Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:  Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world. Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one). Make it real for people and build trust.    Risks & Challenges  People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.  Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles. Describe your plan for solving these challenges.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"8 Campaigns

<h3>Noosa</h3>
<p>Our Vision: to build and grow a restaurant group that is independently owned by our chefs. We believe in giving passionate individuals opportunities to grow and flourish while at the same time growing our restaurant community with exciting, sustainable &amp; creative experiences. </p>
<ul>
<li>Our Noosa team has 70 (!) years of combined restaurant experience, including restaurants in Erie (1201 Kitchen, since 2008) and Westfield (Bird 2016). Our management team consists of Dan Kern (chef, director of food) J.b Innes (FOH manager) Mike Karle (chef) &amp; Adam Williams (chef)</li>

<li>Your help is so important! We have a vision and need your help to achieve it! We are pouring our entire pool of resources into the restaurant to remodel the kitchen &amp; dining room!

<h3>Dash Training Facility</h3>
<p>Dash Training Facility is a new sports performance gym located in Livermore, California. This gym is geared towards the peak performance of serious athletes. We are different than any other sports performance gym<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> because we cover all aspects of performance. The three aspects of</span> performance are physical ability, mental strength and recovery. The most advanced athletic training methods in the industry will be applied to achieve top physical ability.

After an intense workout or long season, compression massage and cryotherapy will be provided to ensure recovery. While every other sports performance facility focuses solely on improving physical ability, the Dash experience will be a one stop shop for serious and dedicated athletes to reach their full potential.</p>
<p>We will be the only sports performance gym to offer memberships for complete access to our weight lifting equipment and thirty yards of turf.</p>

<p>Food Before Love, a community for food lovers everywhere to connect, discover and share amazing food experiences together.</p>
<p>Since 2012, we've grown from reviewing restaurants locally to internationally. We’ve also evolved into a platform that curates food-centric events and trips around the world. Food Before Love was created to give food lovers everywhere a platform to tell their own stories through living and dining across cities and cultures while creating these experiences on their own terms.</p>

<p>We’ve received tons of support servicing over 2500 attendees, and made great strides in providing a unique space for the under-served foodie. We have held over 100 events in the past 5 years through partnerships, sponsorships and our signature events like Mimosaholic Brunch Series, Mac Madness, The Natural Hair Brunch Affair and even traveling with a group to Cartagena, Colombia -- just to name a few!</p>

<p>Food Before Love has come to be synonymous with acceptance and visibility. It is a huge part of what makes the brand what it is, and why I’m asking for your help to expand. In order to create our very first food festival next year, the business needs the support of a team to scale.</p>

<p>An increase in our financial capital will give us a head start on bringing bigger, more unique and inclusive experiences to our growing list of supporters, starting with our food festival. Your contribution will <strong>directly</strong> <strong>support</strong> crucial positions we’re adding to the Food Before Love brand. We’ll be bringing food-loving writers, an editor, and creative managers on board to help provide more for my fellow food lovers, and allow us to execute on those ideas we have in store for you.</p>

<p>My name is Vic Pellegrini: creator and owner operator of Bullseye Virtual Combat. 5 years ago I had a vision for a more advanced, realistic version of the Lasertag game I grew up with. Countless hours over many days, weeks and months were spent planning, constructing and testing until approximately 3 years ago when my vision became a reality. Now, we are New Jersey’s first Tactical Lasertag, running video game style missions on an ever expanding field while tracking EVERY SINGLE shot you take. Returning players even have the ability to earn special accommodations and rewards as the rank up on our online leaderboards.</p>

<p>My vow to every one of my customers is to absolutely, hands down, blow you away with all that we have to offer, and provide you with enough variety to keep you coming back time and time again!</p>
<p>This campaign was created because it's time for us to go bigger! I want to provide my customers a more epic battle experience THIS season. We started out small to prove the concept, and we have experienced a lot of growth <span data-term=""goog_507819011"" tabindex=""0"">in 3 years</span>.

<h2><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></h2>
<p>We will be open for business in April 2018 no matter what. We are fully funded, insured and equipped to handle our current customers just like in 2017. The purpose of this campaign, however, is so we can acquire the additional gear we need to make our Bullseye experience even better.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our equipment is all purchased through Icombat, which is based out of Whitewater, Wisconsin. It is some of the most expensive lasertag technology on the market, but there is a reason we have chosen this equipment. With ultra-realistic look and feel, all of our gear is integrated into a top of the line software system that also records and tracks everything online. Since you get what you pay for, we feel it is well worth it. We purchase each set in doubles so teams are always even, and we also plan to buy extra headbands for our zombie modes.  </p>

</div></div>","My name is Vic Pellegrini: creator and owner operator of Bullseye Virtual Combat. 5 years ago I had a vision for a more advanced, realistic version of the Lasertag game I grew up with. Countless hours over many days, weeks and months were spent planning, constructing and testing until approximately 3 years ago when my vision became a reality. Now, we are New Jersey’s first Tactical Lasertag, running video game style missions on an ever expanding field while tracking EVERY SINGLE shot you take. Returning players even have the ability to earn special accommodations and rewards as the rank up on our online leaderboards.

My vow to every one of my customers is to absolutely, hands down, blow you away with all that we have to offer, and provide you with enough variety to keep you coming back time and time again!
This campaign was created because it's time for us to go bigger! I want to provide my customers a more epic battle experience THIS season. We started out small to prove the concept, and we have experienced a lot of growth in 3 years. We have more guns, more grenades and more in game extras, but we can do so much more! Right now, our capabilities are to have 12 players at any given time on the field. 12 is fun, but more would be even better! We have nearly unlimited space to expand our field, and are currently only limited by the amount of equipment we have available. Our state of the art system can handle 10x that many players at once and we can customize missions to create just about any battle scenario we can come up with. 
Imagine:
3 teams of 10 all trying to capture one center objective
3 teams of 10 now defending their own objective while still trying to capture the others.
Epic Zombie Battles. 
You and your squad vs a zombie horde, and the player (or zombie) with the most points wins! 
The possibilities are literally endless.
Your contributions can help us ramp up much quicker than we might otherwise be able to. We are on the verge of something extraordinary, and would love your support in getting there.

<h3>ABOUT US</h3>
<p>Caldos de Corazón is a small food business that provides a monthly rotation hearty soup meals of international variety that are ready-to-go for the busy student or professional. We started during a turbulent time of earthquakes and other tribulations beyond our control, but despite it, the market reception to innovative concepts rings strong in Cholula, Mexico.</p>
<p>The idea came from Jonathan, a dancer and marketer by profession, who after living in New York City for a year sought cosmopolitan ideas found in one of the major urban heartbeats of the world. After 2 contracts saving money working on the Disney Dream cruise ship, he came back to Mexico and joined forces with Juanelo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Juanelo, though an electrical engineer by trade, worked for a family business that catered to the national oil giant, PEMEX and worked with several startups. His franchise knowledge and operational know-how keeps the business running and is currently laying the groundwork for our procedures and legal steps that will contribute to our franchise eligibility in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>We want to create an eco-friendly food option that is accessible and also satisfies the internationally diverse palates of the Puebla market.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Your Contribution Will Go Towards</h3>
<p>We all know opening a food service business is both rough and pricey, so here is a breakdown of what your contributions will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decorating/furnishing our new store front location (already picked out!)</li>
<li>The first quarter of operating costs (roughest one!)</li>
<li>The purchase of new/refurbished/second-hand equipment custom made to store and serve soups.</li>
<li>Cost of any renovations or modifications to new space.</li>
<li>Decor, new business sign and marketing costs from third-party firm (wary that a solid company image needs to hire a solid marketing firm!)</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reinvesting into the talented pool that is found in the university cities of Puebla and Cholula.</li>
<li>Ecologically friendly. We have a no-styrofoam policy and waste is minimal.</li>
<li>Anything unsold and leftover will go to disenfranchised communities in affiliation with local churches and their mission endeavors.</li>

<p>For a couple of years I’ve been roasting coffee for friends and family. I can’t keep up with demand from friends and so want to purchase a small commercial roaster. There is a significant jump in capacity from home roasters to commercial roasters, and so in addition to supplying my friends and family, I am also seeking Crafers West neighbours who are interested in supply.</p>
<p>I'm currently roasting a Colombian Supremo which produces a bold, slightly spicy espresso that stands-up well in milk based drinks. Coffee roasted just a couple of days ago simply can’t be purchased at the supermarket, and is even hard to find in specialty coffee shops.</p>
<p>At this stage I can provide whole beans (not pre ground) for the purists who grind their coffee fresh before every cup.  As well as the Colombian bean I’m currently roasting, there are a couple of other high-end single origin beans that I’ve had great success with.</p>
</div><div>
<p>I need to establish about 10 neighbours who want ongoing supply. <strong>What I can offer is specialty single origin coffee to your door within days / hours of it being roasted. </strong></p>
<p>I have created an offer on this website of a one-off 250g purchase for people who just want to try the beans before any further commitment. In addition to that offer are a limited number of 3 x 250g and 3 x 500g offers. </p>

<h2>My dream and me.</h2>
<p>My dream is to set up an affordable doggy spa in Wrexham, North Wales. With top of the range equipment, training in holistic methods and kinder methods of grooming, a bright and friendly atmosphere and above all a relaxing, fun experience for all types and breeds of dogs.</p>
<p>I have owned dogs all my life, and after a bout of severe depression left me unable to work, I moved into grooming friends dogs. Many of them came to me with tales of cage dryers, itching after shampoo's and a stressful experience for the dog. After seeing some close friends work in an amazingly professional, yet calm and gentle manner I was moved to set up a salon like no other in my area - A holistic dog spa dedicated to affordable, but fun and relaxing, treatments for our beloved pets!</p>
<p>Having my own salon has allowed me time to dedicate to another passion of mine - helping rescue dogs find their forever homes! Offering a free groom to rescue centres helps immensely,  giving the dogs the makeover that can often make a huge difference. </p>

<p>Holistic grooming is the practice of grooming your pet in a stress-free environment in order to provide optimal health for both body and mind.</p>
<p>Dogs and cats are extremely intuitive to our emotions. They pick up the chemicals we excrete from our bodies created from our own emotions. They know when we exhibit stresses because of anger, frustration or feeling rushed. As a result of their pack mentality, a dog interprets these stresses as “unbalanced” and they begin to lose confidence and trust in their surroundings and their pack, because of this I am hoping to design a calm and peaceful experience for both the owner and the dog</p>
<p>Many larger salons have an “assembly line” model that requires you to drop off early and pick up 6-8 hours later. The purpose is to allow bathers to pre-wash your pet and place in cage dryers for long periods of time until the dog is dry. This “hands-off” procedure allows the groomers to knock off more dogs, creating a more profitable business, and more stressful dogs!. In my holistic salon I take in one dog at a time, with the professional groomer working hands-on from bath to drying to haircut in a much more personal manner. This way any of the pets needs can be attended to completely.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need is equipment!<br/>It's not cheap setting up an exclusive doggy spa and I aim to offer top of the range treatments for pets, whilst keeping costs as low as possible to pass onto the owners.<br/><br/>£1450 -  The Jacuzzi Spa Bath.<br/>This is an innovative new product dedicated to the growing trend of relaxation therapy for pets. The bath features massage bubble jet technology, releasing thousands of bubbles per minute to relax joints and muscles for an immediate sensation of well-being. The bath also has a warm water function to increase circulation Offers effective, soothing hydrotherapy, ideal for mature or arthritic dogs, or those suffering with stiffness from injuries or accidents.</p>
<p>£700 - The Aeolus Lo Lo table.<br/>This grooming table adjusts to one of the lowest points on the market, enabling step on access for mature or less mobile animals. Simply step the dog onto the table, and raise up electrically to a working height. Stops the need for lifting animals onto tables, causing distress to them and back pain for the groomer.</p>
<p>£850 - Neptune Electric bath - Same as the table, the bath is adjustable, allowing larger breeds, and dogs with movement difficulties a much easier way of accessing the bath. At a larger depth, this bath is ideal for larger breeds as well as small. </p>
<p>£500 - Salon Interior Improvements! Colours are extremely important. Dogs view them different to us, but because WE are relaxed, our dogs are often relaxed. I have a bright space allowing natural light, and to make the most of this with bright, calming colours. Greens, browns and natural colours will set up a peaceful feeling to the salon.</p>
<p>£200 - Shampoos, balms, facials and other grooming products. The most costly expense to a grooming salon is the products used. Holistic grooming understands that high-quality products are essential for a healthy skin and coat and will not compromise health for cost. I will be hoping to use WildWash products in my salon, top of the range, natural products from UK sellers.</p>

My dream is to set up an affordable doggy spa in Wrexham, North Wales. With top of the range equipment, training in holistic methods and kinder methods of grooming, a bright and friendly atmosphere and above all a relaxing, fun experience for all types and breeds of dogs.
I have owned dogs all my life, and after a bout of severe depression left me unable to work, I moved into grooming friends dogs. Many of them came to me with tales of cage dryers, itching after shampoo's and a stressful experience for the dog. After seeing some close friends work in an amazingly professional, yet calm and gentle manner I was moved to set up a salon like no other in my area - A holistic dog spa dedicated to affordable, but fun and relaxing, treatments for our beloved pets!
Having my own salon has allowed me time to dedicate to another passion of mine - helping rescue dogs find their forever homes! Offering a free groom to rescue centres helps immensely,  giving the dogs the makeover that can often make a huge difference.

A true community gathering space, Creative Grounds DC goes beyond the traditional coffee bar model to include a unique and fulfilling arts education program for kids, studio rental and exhibition space. Located in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Washington, DC, the space is a 2,000 sq ft facility that will serve as the go-to destination for art-related activities in the nation’s capital.We invite YOU to join us on our journey to create spaces where we embrace and celebrate creativity and community. Proud parents and founders of Creative Grounds DC, Kenn & Asmara, with their children, Khalab & Samra  Why a community arts space?Bloomingdale has been a great place to raise our kids. It is vibrant, eclectic and friendly.  As residents, parents to two active children, and art lovers, we are happy to see the increasing number of families and artists making Bloomingdale home. The only missing piece: more indoor organized activities for children. ANC representative and Bloomingdale Civic Association Second Vice President, Bertha Holliday agrees with us. She states,“Creative Grounds DC will address two of Bloomingdale’s major needs: more enriching organized activities for Bloomingdale's increasing child population and a formal permanent space for galvanizing and promoting Bloomingdale's unique arts and cultural communities.”  It was with this mind that we thoughtfully considered how best to give back to the community we love. Creative Grounds DC was born.Our new home! 1822 North Capital Street, NW, Washington, DC  Contributing to the DC Arts SceneAs you can see on this map, we’re centered in one of the historically creative communities in DC, with the famed Howard Theatre, U Street Music Hall, Phillips Collection, Adams Morgan, and Civil War Museum all less than two miles from us. Creative Grounds DC will be a great addition and we are ready to contribute to this storied history. But we are going to need your help! We believe that art is healing, transformative, and for children, the developmental benefits of arts practice serve as the basis for all learning and emotional growth. We’ve already started developing a pretty cool arts curriculum highlighting famous art movements throughout history. Children will get the opportunity to explore Pop Art, Impressionism and the work of the Color School of Washington, to name a few, in fun and developmentally appropriate ways. With program names like the Happy Scribblers and Tiny Artists in Residence, it’s sure to be fun for all. We are passionate about art programs for children because we have witnessed the successful use of art practice in children with self-regulation challenges, emotional trauma and developmental delays.  Children are encouraged to express their frustrations and feelings through a paint brush, drawing, meditation, and/or yoga. Khalab, a young, budding artist Samra's self-expression through art Providing an Affordable Space for Local ArtistsKeep in mind the rapidly changing city of Washington, DC and it’s effect on affordable spaces. The development boom has meant an increase in the cost of living, less affordable spaces and limited options. For artists, it makes living and working in DC challenging. Creative Grounds DC is dedicated to providing a platform for artists and art enthusiasts to practice and showcase their craft without the burden of high-priced fees. We also understand that art and art practice can be expensive so we have promised to never turn an artist or child away because of limited resources. Simply put, Creative Grounds DC is our way of supporting our neighborhood and city with thoughtful reflection on the role of creativity, learning, and expression in community building. At Mural Jam, a community art project sponsored by Albus Cavus, local artists spent a day painting a massive mural on a concrete retaining wall behind the Rhode Island Avenue Shopping Center in Washington, DC. Photo by Kevin Harber Supporting Local Small BusinessThis project has also given us the opportunity to support local business. We’re working with locally owned and operated specialty coffee roaster, Nagadi Coffee Roaster, a company whose mission is producing a great quality product, that empowers growers, and improves their lives. We’re equally proud to work with women of the Crossroads Community Food Network, a micro-enterprise training program for food business entrepreneurs. We’ve been very intentional about who we work with because every individual that is part of this initiative is also a part of this canvas we’re painting called Creative Grounds DC. It’s important for us to weave our social activism, belief in collaboration, and service into this business. To say that this project has given us so much joy is an understatement. We have taken all that we love, including our interests, hobbies and most importantly, the values that we hold dear and created a business that will make us all proud. Serving you the best in specialty coffee to start your day  Why Indiegogo?Exposure to art enhances everyone’s lives. When talking with neighbors, artists, bloggers and our very own children, we’ve repeatedly heard that people want and need more indoor enrichment activities for children and families. Add to that the desire to have fewer bars, restaurants, and clubs, we believe Creative Grounds DC is a great addition to the Bloomingdale neighborhood the District as a whole.  As a supporter of the arts community here in DC, we strive to provide opportunities to create, connect and engage with art and other artists.  With YOUR support, we can do this and so much more!  What will your contribution support?We are committed to providing everyone access to Creative Grounds DC through the use of the space as a platform to showcase their work and to enable their participation in all Creative Grounds DC programming. Art supplies, the art library and the Hearts and Arts program (arts organizations working with underserved communities) will all benefit from your support. While Creative Grounds DC is a privately funded endeavor, it is through individual donations that we are able to ensure the diversity and access to programs, essential build out, equipment, and supplies. More than this, your support is proof of concept that the arts are vitally important and add value to our community.  Werk, Werk, Werk, WerkIn just the last 6 months, we have immersed ourselves in the work of becoming Creative Grounds DC by:
Obtaining an LLC, registered agent and other legal documents;
Personally vetting and hosting behind the scene openings for potential suppliers, vendors, strategic partners and art educators;
Attending cupping and food tastings; We wanted to offer you the best coffee and food experience. You are going to LOVE the coffee and food.
We received mentorship from the good people at Keffa Coffee, Keren Restaurant and Anna Banana on how to make this project a success (Thank you Ladies!);
Securing a brand strategist, videographer and accountant.  It takes a village, right?
Scheduling barista training and art classes--you know just to brush up and learn new skills. and there’s still so much more to do...

It will also have a language program to help children learn other languages at a very early stage.</p><p>It will have different workshops (theater, music, dance, art, and others).

I am raising money to create a preschool that offers a high quality fun artistic educational environment for the little one that is also affordable for their parents.The preschool is going to be artistic based, where the children will learn through music, dance, paint, crafts and other activities. The program will also allow the children to learn through experience, and make everyday a learning adventure for them. It will have a lot of different rich activities throughout the day to keep the children engaged and motivated to learn and play. It will also have a language program to help children learn other languages at a very early stage.It will have different workshops (theater, music, dance, art, and others). We will have a nice outdoor space to allow the kids to get fresh air and get dirty and a science lab. Kids will spend their day moving from a workshop to another. Also, the preschool will have a designated area for those parents who work from home, parents could sit and work while enjoying a cup of coffee while their kids play and interact with their peers.With your contributions, we can make a difference and together we can build a better tomorrow!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The world deserves a better chili. It is my sincere intention to deliver that better chili:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211020236569942&amp;set=a.3502303164378.162293.1475695888&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478648367/o1i9cvqwmswv6zzrgmsa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>My name is Larney Hunter and I am the son of Willie White. In 1989, my father taught me how to prepare the best hot dog chili that I had ever tasted in my 22 years of living at that particular time. Newsflash, some 27 years later, I have searched high and low and have not tasted anything that compares. Nothing has even  come close. Meantime, the secret delicious recipe remained hidden in my hands for 27 years.</p>
<p>In 1993 I began working for Metropolitan Transit Authority as a Bus Operator. My father passed on to glory in 1995. Anyone familiar with vendor licensing knows that there is preference given to veterans when the Health Department issues these licenses. My father was a Veteran, I was not. So he took the business with him, but he left me with the recipe. I continued to work as a Bus Operator for over 19 years and left the company in  March 2012. I began making the chili for my children's Summer Day Camp in 2011. People would rave over the chili and would ask who made it. The camp director, and my good friend Roger, would explain that Mr. Larney made that chili and started calling it 'That World Famous.' Fast forward to the Summer of 2015, after making the chili for the camp for some time, Roger said to me jokingly yet serious, ' you should record peoples reactions and call it, Chili Cam Confessions.' Promptly, I began recording reactions and amassed a library of some very interesting reactions. In September 2015 I received my Qualifying Certificate in Food Protection. I made the decision to not just get reactions but to go into Business for myself. In short, the time had come for me to be <i>About My Fathers Business.</i></p>
<p>What we need for this campaign to be successful is your financial support in the form of donations, especially, from those of you that have had an opportunity to taste and believe in this wonderful time tested product. We also want our constituents to understand that their support is not limited to financial donations. Support can come in the form of a sincere endorsement to their friends and families. Let us harness the power of social media and be a part of something that is bigger than ourselves.</p>

But we can’t do it without you.We have been working tirelessly to restore the natural cycles of the grasslands. The engine driving this restorative process? Grazing animals like cattle, sheep, and goats, properly managed. These animals till and fertilize the earth. Their manure combines with decomposing vegetation to build soil, preventing erosion and flooding. Grass flourishes, removing more carbon from the atmosphere. And land managers can raise more nutrient-dense food to feed the world.Now we’re taking that a step further with our new Land-to-Market verification project, to empower consumers to know which products are healing the environment as a result of how they were produced. This verification is outcome based, where farmers and ranchers have to scientifically demonstrate, with empirical data to back it up, that they are rebuilding broken ecosystems.Empowering PeopleWhat if every time you snacked you were making the world a better place? What if every time you went to the grocery store you were reversing climate change? What if every time you went to a restaurant you were increasing wildlife populations? What if the next wallet or handbag you bought recharged water tables with clean fresh water? What if every time you shopped for clothes you were bringing a family out of poverty?“What if,” can become a reality...At the end of the day, our movement is focused on people, or “team humanity,” as our founder Allan Savory often calls them. We want to see regular folks, on both ends of the spectrum, from the producers who are striving to nurture their land, while making a living for their families, to the average shopper who wants to make good decisions when feeding and clothing their family, but is equally overwhelmed by the many issues plaguing our world, and is overloaded by greenwashing and the inherent anonymity in the marketplace.It’s time to reconnect these two ends of the supply “chain.” We want to facilitate producers getting access to new markets and premiums above commodity pricing, and we want to take the guesswork out of things for consumers, to allow them to connect with not only the products they believe in, but the people behind them as well. We want to celebrate the boots-on-the-ground frontline soil-saviors while at the same time spotlight the countless working-class men and women who deeply desire to shop in a way that supports those folks.We've seen a new awakening among people to embrace living in harmony with their environment — making healthier food choices, and staying active. As we blaze forward, our next step, at the Savory Institute, is to engage consumers to make that as simple and convenient as possible - this is the age of the Consumer Revolution. As the incredible poet Wendell Berry was quoted, “Eating is an agricultural act,” and so is getting dressed every morning. We must meet people where they are — their daily food and clothing choices.HistoryOur organization, The Savory Institute, is focused on the large-scale restoration of the world’s grasslands. Grasslands are typically underappreciated and yet are quite possibly the most important ecosystem to humanity. They are our main source of soil fertility, as most croplands are former grasslands, they are responsible for much of the recharging of our underground fresh water reserves, and they offer a massive solution to climate change as grassland soils sequester more carbon than any other land-based ecosystem. With properly managed livestock we can restore these environments to their peak productivity (See Allan Savory’s TED Talk).Our goal is to positively impact 1 billion hectares (2.47B acres) of grasslands by 2025. This is approximately ⅕ of the world’s grasslands and we believe this is a tipping point to start reversing the many ills plaguing the planet. (See our Indiegogo campaign from last year to learn more) We’re pleased to announce it’s working.  Our vast network of producers and accredited Savory Network Hubs have been able to sculpt degraded terrain and transform it into thriving working landscapes all over the globe. Grasslands are being healed on every continent as pastoralists of all races, genders, religions, and ages band together in a unified effort to regenerate the land and paint a brighter future for all humanity.We’re on track to meet our impact goals, but the next big hurdle to accelerate this movement is market-based. Currently, there are farmers and ranchers that are creating products that are healing the land as a result of how they were managed during their production. However, due to a lack of options for those producers, these products are going into commodity supply chains entirely undifferentiated from the products that degraded land as a result of their production. At the same time, we have many bold brands who are striving to access these products but do not have the contacts or tools necessary to locate and source from these regenerative producers.Together we can change that...End to Business As Usual For Anonymous Supply ChainsWe don’t need to just tweak a few things in how our food and clothing supply chains work, we need to take a sledgehammer to them. The true cost of fast-food and fast-fashion are expended in unseen externalities to our local communities and our environment. There is rampant exploitation of our land, animals, and people, taking place on a global scale.All the tools exist to resolve this. We need shorter supply chains with fewer middle-men. We need a system where the consumer is empowered with transparency to know how their product was produced and traceability to know where the ingredients in their products come from. What we need are cooperative supply networks that work regionally to help people conveniently access the products that most align with their values.Together, we can send the signals to the marketplace that we the people have a right to access the food and fiber products that most align with our values.The Opportunity to Heal Acreage on a Global ScaleFor decades, ranchers and farmers, utilizing the practices of Holistic Management, developed by our founder Allan Savory, have taken regular measurements of their land’s health.

<h3>We are Amy and Chrystal, creators of The Magic Bus Boutique, Indie Om.</h3>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>The Magic Bus was created from a vision greater than ourselves. We know there are children in need of basic things like shoes and cloths, school funds for education, clean water, and nutritious food. As Indie Om grows, our goal is to give 10% of our profits to organizations that help children around the world. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In order to accomplish this goal, we have decided to create our own organic clothing line! Creating our own clothing line allows us to keep our prices down, as well as increase our revenue, and give more to the children.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We plan to employ a small family community in Bali to make our cloths. We will work directly with them, and establish a mutually positive relationship to ensure fairness.  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With the total costs of traveling to Bali, purchasing materials, and employing a family in Bali, we need to raise a total of $10,000. We are excited to take this next step toward our greater vision!</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are also starting a campaign to collect shoes for children ages 0-16, and send them to Ghana, West Africa.  We want to keep on giving back.  Starting our own clothing line will allow Indie Om to grow beyond our current capacity, and reach a wider population.  The magic bus is ready! Your contribution will help the children to thrive, not just survive. The children are our future, and we know they deserve a chance to fulfill their dreams, and shine bright.</span></p>
<p>We greatly appreciate your contribution.  If you are not able to contribute now, please spread the word and share this campaign with more people.</p>

</div></div>","We are Amy and Chrystal, creators of The Magic Bus Boutique, Indie Om.


The Magic Bus was created from a vision greater than ourselves. We know there are children in need of basic things like shoes and cloths, school funds for education, clean water, and nutritious food. As Indie Om grows, our goal is to give 10% of our profits to organizations that help children around the world. In order to accomplish this goal, we have decided to create our own organic clothing line! Creating our own clothing line allows us to keep our prices down, as well as increase our revenue, and give more to the children.
We plan to employ a small family community in Bali to make our cloths. We will work directly with them, and establish a mutually positive relationship to ensure fairness.  With the total costs of traveling to Bali, purchasing materials, and employing a family in Bali, we need to raise a total of $10,000. We are excited to take this next step toward our greater vision!
We are also starting a campaign to collect shoes for children ages 0-16, and send them to Ghana, West Africa.  We want to keep on giving back.  Starting our own clothing line will allow Indie Om to grow beyond our current capacity, and reach a wider population.  The magic bus is ready! Your contribution will help the children to thrive, not just survive. The children are our future, and we know they deserve a chance to fulfill their dreams, and shine bright.
We greatly appreciate your contribution.  If you are not able to contribute now, please spread the word and share this campaign with more people.
In love and gratitude,

</h3>
<br/>
<p>I moved home with my family a few months after
finishing university back in 2014 and spent 6 months looking for work with no
signs of any interviews or interest from the very few jobs available in my
local area, so I decided to use the retail and creative experiences of my life
before and during university to become self-employed.</p>
<p>I opened for business in late May of this year
(2015) and have been slowly building my business up from what little money I
had to invest into it.<span>  I originally
planned to open off of my own back and use whatever I make to improve and
expand my business into the rest of the space that I am renting; and for the
past couple of months it has been working. That is until recently.</span></p>
<p>Around 4 weeks ago another store opened just around
the corner from me and the competition has begun.<span>  The sad fact being that I have no more money
to invest into keeping my business going after I have already sank everything
into it and even created a fair package of debt.  As a singular owner and runner of my business
and only able to source a little bit of support from family, I simply can-not
compete with this new store financially. 
The new store has been opened by a group of 5 friends who all have jobs
and constant income to continue injecting funds into their business.</span></p>
<p>This campaign is to gather funds to help clear enough
debt to keep me going, bring in new stock and releases ready for the run up to Christmas,
secure Games Workshop as a supplier and other important products and improvements
that my store needs now.<span>  It is very
important for me to secure these funds, otherwise I will be going under within
the next couple of months, with enough debt to, politely put; make my life a
misery for a long time.</span></p>
<p>It is not a hobby to me; despite the fact the
business is based around my interests I am very serious about it and try to
convey my passion and knowledge through my business and share it with my
customers as much as I can. It is my livelihood
and I desperately want to make it work; and if it doesn't work, is hard to bare
thinking about.</p>
<p>I can-not find a way to thank anyone who contributes.<span>  There would be no way to adequately show my
appreciation to the people who find it in themselves to help me out.  The money raised will be going a long way
toward securing my business a chance at survival in a still very tenuous
economy.  It will help cement my ideals
to sell for a fair and competitive price and to compete with online stores as
best I can as a bricks and mortar store. 
The money will pave the way towards future success by securing Games
Workshop as a brand and product, as well as towards the creation and
implementation of our website and the immense potential that a website gives to
businesses. </span></p>

I moved home with my family a few months after
finishing university back in 2014 and spent 6 months looking for work with no

into it and even created a fair package of debt.  As a singular owner and runner of my business
and only able to source a little bit of support from family, I simply can-not

The new store has been opened by a group of 5 friends who all have jobs
and constant income to continue injecting funds into their business.
This campaign is to gather funds to help clear enough
debt to keep me going, bring in new stock and releases ready for the run up to Christmas,
secure Games Workshop as a supplier and other important products and improvements
that my store needs now.  It is very
important for me to secure these funds, otherwise I will be going under within
the next couple of months, with enough debt to, politely put; make my life a

So,
what exactly does the money do?  And why
does it matter to you?
The
     £10,000 raised will support a small, local business in a slowly
     regenerating part of North Wales that was once a tourist hot-spot (Rhyl).
Breakdown:

£1,500 will secure Games Workshop as a supplier; the
     biggest name in the UK for Table-Top War-gaming.
£500 will be invested into the creation,
     implementation, hosting and supplying of a website and in-store catalogues
     for Mail-Order sales and customer orders.
£4,000 will be spent clearing an already outstanding
     debt used to purchase fixtures, fittings, insurances, stock and other
     necessities.  This small debt
     clearance will secure the business survival over the Christmas period.

£4,000 will be invested into Christmas stock and extra
     fixtures/fittings for Christmas displays. 
     The money will also be used to help order enough stock to implement
     Christmas incentives, deals, competitions, give-aways and much more, to
     help compete with other stores both physical and online.


So, why does investing matter to you?
· 
You will be supporting a unique
business and an individual that cares about their customers.
· 
A Unique Selling Point (USP); To
compete with major online retailers by providing the fairest price to our
customers as we can afford to do so. 
While offering a friendly environment where they can meet other individuals
of like-minded interests and play games with each-other.  And run by a passionate, honest, true
enthusiast of games and other niche hobbies, that can understand and interact
with customers on a friendly level, offering insight, knowledge and interest in
their hobbies and to devise competitions, give-aways, bundles and etc
marketing/promotions for customers.
What if the full amount is not reached?
In the circumstance that our goal is
not met, then we would re-launch the goal with what has already been raised,
deducted from the total amount.  The
amount raised previously would be invested into one or more of the
bullet-points listed, depending on the amount raised.
The
Impact Of Investing

While the local area is being rejuvenated, it still
     lacks many businesses and most of the shops are empty units.  Investment would help keep at least one
     of those units occupied with a shop.

By helping keep my business running it will help build
     the niche Gaming comunity, unlike the already thriving Computer Gaming
     community.  It will also create a
     social spot for Gamers to interact, meet and play.  Which can help with societal
     interactions in the future.

The longer my business can remain open, the more chance
     it has of succeeding, growing and developing into something much more.  In the Midlands and most of the UK, there
     is a huge gaming community.  But it
     seems that North Wales has not quite reached that level yet.  In the future I hope to bring gaming
     festivals and Conventions to North Wales, even host some in the future if
     my business flourishes.

On a much more personal level.  By investing, you help me keep my job in
     a very tenuous economy and job market. 
     I spent 6 months hunting for jobs and dealing with the issues that
     brings.  And instead of remaining on
     Government benefits I am trying my best to make something of my situation
     and to one day give back to the community.

</a></u>for Stolen
Motor Vehicles, it was recorded that some 7.2 million cars were
reported stolen around the world in 2012. Motivation for car thefts
ranges from juvenile joyriding to more sinister intents like illegal
export, usage of stolen car as getaway transport during armed robbery
and as car bombs in terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>
Car thieves these days do not just
pick locks and drive away the loot. They are able to disarm car
alarms, cameras and GPS. Hence, we are so left with the good old
method of keeping an eye on our cars - our eyes literally!</p>

</div></div>","Just
how many times have you been caught in a roadside or car park
emergency, waving your arms like crazy to get the attention of
oncoming vehicles? 

Professional
help sometimes takes a little too long to arrive and is too costly.












Well at least for some achievable
tasks, and so we have designed and built the Motoqlik app for road
users to shout out for help and have fellow users in the vicinity to
come offer their help via a bidding system and get paid for helping.
When
you feel insecure about parking in a certain place or maybe in a
naughty mood to skip paying hefty parking charges, you can get the
Motoqlik community to help watch over your car!





Our kind Motoqlik helper gets the
reward you put up (for example $1, $20, $50 ... ) only when the task is
completed. 





With a little incentive$, people
do go the extra mile helping one another. 

The
same approach goes for users whom are in desperate need of
jumpstarting their cars due to a flat battery while on the side of a
freeway or at a public car park. 










With a
bidding system, people get to know what level of reward makes sense
and that hopefully puts the pressure on professional motoring service
providers in lowering their price.





Not all things are chargeable!
Let there be goodwill.


Every Motoqlik signup requires
entering of user's car plate number which used by each member to
search and identify each other. 

Through
that, Motoqlik sets out to build a monstrous database of motorists
and their vehicles, ultimately becoming the channel for users to
contact each another in the event of:




	suspicious
	activities around someone's car/motorbike


irresponsible
	bump and run



	valuables
	spotted in full view inside a car


headlights
	not turned off at the car park








Messaging
within Motoqlik is referred to as ""sticking a note on
windscreen"" and that is absolutely free of charge.




The
Noble Cause

We feel that our ride is very dear
to us as they cost us an arm and a leg (at least in the country we
live in) and we detest anything untoward happening to them - car
crimes especially. 


According to
INTERPOL’s
Automated
Search
Facility
(ASF)
for Stolen
Motor Vehicles, it was recorded that some 7.2 million cars were
reported stolen around the world in 2012. Motivation for car thefts
ranges from juvenile joyriding to more sinister intents like illegal
export, usage of stolen car as getaway transport during armed robbery
and as car bombs in terrorist attacks.

Car thieves these days do not just
pick locks and drive away the loot. They are able to disarm car
alarms, cameras and GPS. Hence, we are so left with the good old
method of keeping an eye on our cars - our eyes literally!
If
we have a huge motoring community behind us, we should be able to get
even more help  keeping our cars safe from harm. So wouldn't you like
to be a part of it?



Motoqlik has a great Road Map and needs your help!

We
certainly need you to join in and help grow this community, at the
same time, support our development work to further enhance this app.

We
are currently evaluating the feasibility of integrating Motoqlik app
with vehicle onboard computer to achieve:



	Collection
	and display of various vehicular metrics.


Making
	intelligence out of these metrics to cognitively sense distress
	signals from vehicles and automatically alerting the community in
	emergency situations whereby the driver/s may be immobilized.



The form of road assistance a
motorist need may also vary country to country and we hope to add
help scenarios that will work in your location. So do feel free to
send us a wishlist of what you think is/are needed :)


How will the Funds be used?
80% of the funds will be used to
build and maintain Version
2 of Motoqlik
App and remaining to keep us in operation for 12 months




	Development costs & updates
	for iOS, Android App and website.



	Hosting fees



	Promotion and Marketing
	initiatives


Accounting
	and legal fees





We hope
you believe in our cause to make life better for motorists like you
and me.

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>LAC is looking to scale the brand across NJ and NYC. We need your preordered service to help us build the brand today. As we face a huge uptick in service requests, now more than ever with the current COVID-19 pandemic, we look to be the safe &amp; reliable choice. Your contribution will allow us to hire and train new employees, expand the service fleet &amp; fully up fit with equipment, offer a wider coverage area, and relocate into a new 4000sq facility to provide protection services and dispatch the detailing &amp; roadside assistance services. In addition, LAC will be able to implement a CRM and inventory systems, that offer additional benefits on tracking customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Preordering with us today not only secures your future service but makes you one of the first to receive our Legendary membership program benefits, which is included for (1) full year at no additional cost. These benefits are currently being kept top secret, but guaranteed to beat any and all competition while providing the ultimate in convenience and care. </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Contributing  to this campaign today will fit right in with our current lifestyle of social distancing. It is our belief that LAC will be the preferred method of service based off our quality, convenience and benefits.  Scaling the business to accommodate customers across the five counties in NJ and Manhattan, NY will be critical to the future success of the business. </p>
<p>This service doesn't reinvent the wheel, it just offers a number of different advantages that typically are not available together.  It also takes the most important thing people have (time), and gives it back to them for other pressing events.</p>
<p>Lastly, we want to do our part in helping put people back to work, from Ohio, California, South Carolina to here in the Tri-State. This business will make a huge impact on the economy right away, from the employees, vehicles, equipment and supplies that will be required to scale appropriately, LAC will provide job security for the foreseeable future and that is what people really need right now.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>After being in the automotive industry over 10 years, I've weighed all the risks and challenges that we may encounter; LAC was designed to cater to the masses. With the amount of vehicles in the tri-state area we will not only meet the demand but maintain the high level of quality and integrity of the brand to expand across the country in 5 - 10 years.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges EVERY business will face is getting quality help. LAC has implemented a employee package with livable wages and health benefits the that will provide each employee with job security. In addition we will actively seek new employees that take the effort to become trained and certified in reconditioning and offer a tuition reimbursement to be paid out over the years of employment.</p>
<p>The next biggest risk we anticipate is maintaining the quality of care and customer satisfaction. How we overcome those risks is by using a survey system that will keep employees honest and on point for not only new customers but most importantly the returning customer. The system will be setup to survey the customer experience each and every time they receive a service, no matter if it is their 1st or 100th appointment.  </p>
<p>There are plenty of other risks and challenges but employees are definitely hands down the biggest challenge there is. As we overcome this, all other risks and challenges can be well maintained with proper systems.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Thank you for spending the time to see what LAC has to offer. We completely understand during these times of unprecedented unemployment you may not have the funds to make a preorder contribution, and that is okay. But please feel free to share this to your friends and family across all your social media platforms, and help us take Legendary Automotive to new heights. </p>

Ottawa, Canada, which offers five types of jasmine scented organic green teas.
To package the teas and sell them, SuraiTea hires Syrian
refugees who have recently arrived in Canada.

2016 in Ottawa. I am an MBA student at the University of Ottawa and previously was an environmental engineer in renewable power and sustainable real estate development. I want to use my skills to do my part to create job opportunities for refugees to help them resettle in Canada and feel at home. I know how important it is to a person to earn a living for financial reasons, but also for self-fulfillment and happiness as well. Furthermore, I hope to show other employers through success at SuraiTea that incorporating refugees into their business is possible. Finally, I want to show that the refugees which we hire are succeeding here in Canada so that Canada will be inclined to accept more refugees because so many more are in need of a safe new home.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471881372/5_xknttc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>

completed in a heritage building in the heart of Ottawa, the national capital of Canada. On April 16, 2016, our online Shopify store was
turned on and it completed its first tea sale later that day. Since the inception of SuraiTea, we have transacted $12,000 in tea sales, created 280 hours of work experience for
refugees, including 20 first days of work in the Canadian economy, and have paid out $5,600 in wages to Syrian refugees.</p><p></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471882222/10_o1bwkw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>With your help, we hope to achieve much more!</b></p><div>
